5664155,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Sarah Polley wears so many hats:  Actress, Screen Writer, Director and author.  I really liked Stories We Tell; it was
captivating and had some surprises I wasn't expecting.  All families keep secrets; some bigger than others.  She
always had my attention with this one.",1381104000,2,270,5.068181818181818
5664156,5,B00BPRI6WG,"A very engaging and emotional family portrait with an interesting, inside view of the process of it's own construction. Really gets at the various angles and overlapping (or contradictory) truths that family stories all have. Highly recommended.",1381017600,,245,5.648648648648648
5664157,2,B00BPRI6WG,"I heard wonderful things about this documentary and was looking forward to seeing it. I was sorely disappointed. The events portrayed happened years earlier and Sarah Polley tries to re-create the story through interviews with family and friends. As a result, there's no authentic sense of surprise or discovery; it feels like a ""reality"" show that's been scripted. For some reason, her father ""narrates"" the story by reading a self-written memoir in which he refers to himself in the third person a la Julius Caesar. It all comes off as contrived--and at times confusing, because the interviewees are identified only by name so it's difficult to tell what their connection to the story is. I barely made it through this one.",1381017600,5,725,5.0
5664158,5,B00BPRI6WG,It is a very sincere and unpretentious film that portrays real human experiences. Intelligent approach! from the part of the director.,1380931200,,134,5.428571428571429
5664159,3,B00BPRI6WG,"I actually LOVE everything Sarah Polley is in and does, but, this Documentary unfortunately much to my surprise falls short I'm actually truly, truly, truly sorry to say. I think that anything this personal is VERY HARD to have reviewed or trashed by others, but, aside from it being apart of somebody's actual personal life it's still a Documentary, therefore, from a Documentary point of view and not from a personal point of view I have to unfortunately just say that it was just okay and worth watching if you like Polley's work which I do, I completely admit to this! But, I have to say that it just wasn't that great, but, I'm happy she made it because I'm always happy to see her in anything. It was good though, but, it just unfortunately falls short I'm so, so sorry to say.",1380844800,,783,4.4825174825174825
5664160,5,B00BPRI6WG,Well written and orgistrated story. It kept my attention and roused my imagination start to stop. I found myself wondering if a lot of us today may have similar meanderings ourselves.,1380672000,,183,4.935483870967742
5664161,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Sarah understands storytelling and draws you in from first frame to the last.
I loved Vanya on 42nd street and this has the same - albeit more honest approach.
This was the best film of the year bar none for my wife and I.",1380672000,,222,4.068181818181818
5664162,3,B00BPRI6WG,"STORIES WE TELL is a quietly thought-provoking expos of how difficult it can be to clarify ""simple"" truths and how ""truth"" can vary a great deal according to who you talk to, even when everyone's doing their honest best. The extended family in this documentary film is a most interesting one, and each individual member is a fascinating character in her or his own right, in spite of, perhaps because of, the fact that there is nothing that truly weird about any of them. The extensive use of home video footage from the 60s, 70s, and 80s really carries the film. The small details--e.g., the father's musing on the fly on the wall--are also significant, as are certain fine points in the dialogue between Director Sarah Polley and the family members she ""interrogates.""

Some true surprises occur during the course of the interviews; STORIES WE TELL goes deep in its own subtle, quiet way. Still, at the risk of sounding like a vulture, I was hoping for some darker--or at least more unusual or startling--revelations. While it's easy to understand why the real substance of the film--I don't want to give away the specifics--is critical stuff for Sarah Polley, it's nothing the average person hasn't seen or read in other works, fact or fiction. STORIES WE TELL also just takes a bit too long to show what it has to show. While the multiple perspectives are intriguing, they become ponderous and repetitive after a while.

In any event, this film functions well as a simple yet very meaningful think-piece. Those who want a lot of variety, excitement, layers & twists, etc, however, may be a trifle bored by it.",1380499200,13,1613,4.777777777777778
5664163,5,B00BPRI6WG,"The Polleys are a large, sometimes happy family living in Canada, when their world is torn asunder by Mom's cancer. Revelation follows revelation -- extramarital affair, who's the real dad? Daughter plays director for a documentary on what really happened -- amid an exploration of what version of the truth is most valid. The kind of movie that gives you optimism about the future of filmmaking, of avenues unexplored. What is and what is not a documentary?",1380499200,,458,4.961038961038961
5664164,5,B00BPRI6WG,"I confess that I am huge fan of Sarah Polley after seeing Away From Her, so I eagerly looked forward to seeing this. I wasn't disappointed. She clearly is one of the most intelligent filmmakers working today. Her writing skills are superb, and she doesn't hesitate to shake up the format, which she does with aplomb in this quirky and surprising documentary. Even though I expected a bombshell at some point, having read about it after it premiered a the Toronto Festival, I was still pretty shocked when it unfolded in front of me. Hilarious, moving, interesting, and even riveting, this movie truly did help my attention throughout and delivered a pretty unique cinematic experience with its fresh take on the staid documentary format. Well worth watching.",1380412800,,758,4.9763779527559056
5664165,4,B00BPRI6WG,Found this movie to be so emotionally gripping. How we are all effected by the choices we make good or bad and the long lasting affects. To hear and see how each of these people love eachother and share that love both good and bad and it how it shapes them into the people they have become.

5664167,5,B00BPRI6WG,Brilliantly done. The truth is there is no truth that is so necessary as to avoid being curious about alternatives. It has been said that all stories are false and some are useful or I suppose you could say that all stories are true and some are useful. Take you pick. Captivatingly original.

5664169,2,B00BPRI6WG,"The documentary starts off interestingly enough but it ended sloppily. The film could have been much shorter but she did a bad job wrapping it up. It was also confusing to watch bc you didn't know who was who. I realize in some respects it may have given away the story to identify certain characters, but it could be done right and not given anything away. I disliked how there was no disclaimer to the reinactment scenes. The lack of disclaimer made the film confusing to watch.",1501632000,,480,4.528735632183908
5664170,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Wow. I'm so glad I happened upon this documentary. It was enthralling, wonderful, moving, thought-provoking... flawless. I wish I could watch it for the first time again. I was so moved be everyone and this story and Diane and Michael and Sarah... mostly Michael. What a beautiful man and father. I could write a novel about my feelings after watching this but I'm only here to say that I was moved to tears, I'll watch it again and I wish I could have dinner with this family cuz I want to know more!

5664172,5,B00BPRI6WG,"One of the most interesting films I've seen in a while. I think some people will find it baffling, but to those I advise give it a chance. I loved it from beginning to end. Fascinating and heartfelt. Emotional but humorous and lighthearted in many ways, its about a true self-journey into how and why she came to be and a clear look at the people, especially her mother and father, who birthed and raised her. Sarah Polley has a good eye and real ability to plumb a story. That story looks at people in a way that shows just how unique our stories are. Great great documentary.",1500249600,,577,4.351851851851852
5664173,4,B00BPRI6WG,"I had no idea what this movie was about and thought perhaps it was a collection of short stories. I found, however, that it was a really interesting study into the real life of a family and I applaud Sarah for putting herself and her family et al. out there for us all to see and hear. I really found it fascinating like you would hearing the secrets of someone you've known all your life and had no idea that there was so much to their story.  I've often said that you don't know what a person's backstory is so to treat each and every person with respect and compassion because you never know if you've run across them on a bad day. Perhaps they've learned some bad news or their life is going a million different directions. This story is like that. You never know someone's backstory unless its told. I found this one worth telling and oh, so interesting. Thank you Sarah!",1499126400,,876,4.341463414634147

-what is love;
-what we live for;
-what we leave after,
and how life might unexpectedly turn on to open up new directions.
The modern view on what is true story that might be real only with multiple opinions.
I would not call this move documentary film that is usually concentrated on fining new facts about particular event that bring your mind from clear vision to chaos of life. This film is an attempt to reconstruct sample feelings of love based on particular story that bring your mind from chaos of life to clear vision of love.",1499040000,,607,4.527272727272727
5664176,5,B00BPRI6WG,The level of bravery to tell such a revealing story is beyond our simple notion of courage. All the characters involved and their perspectives on life are dramatically shaped by one central character; Diane Polley.  This story shows the potential impact that we as individuals can bare in the  lives of those we influence.  Excellent story. Well written. Well produced.,1499040000,,369,5.116666666666666

Family bonds, love, relationships, secrets and truth are all examined and revealed with such raw and open way.  This is a unique and exquisite experiment in delving into family dynamics and you can't help but be drawn into the meaning of it all.

5664178,5,B00BPRI6WG,"We all know you have to be pretty gutsy to get on camera and speak about your life - the good, bad AND the ugly. I have the utmost respect and admiration for this documentary, I felt there was not a dull moment.  I loved the genuine display of vulnerability and honesty of all of those involved. I love how Michael took accountability and responsibility for his part in the breakdown of the marriage and him also saying favorable things about Harry, such as Harry loving Diane in the way he did.  Michael spoke on the infidelity from a very different angle.  Everyone was so well spoken, articulate and engaging to me.  I experienced various emotions and had a few or more laughs. This documentary was very well put together and I will be watching it again.",1498176000,2,757,4.5036496350364965
5664179,5,B00BPRI6WG,This movie tells the story of love and loss and ultimately the tragedy and joy of the imperfect human condition. It is thought provoking and beautiful. I absolutely recommend it.,1498003200,,178,4.966666666666667
5664180,1,B00BPRI6WG,"I thought it was in extremely poor taste.  There was actually a time when these things were considered shameful and, very rightly, kept secret.  I don't know why this film maker thought it would be acceptable to humiliate her father (or his memory) by disclosure of, not only, her mother's decades long betrayal but, by the daughters collusion as well.  The kind, dottering father - who was a wonderful provider to this ungrateful bunch, is portrayed as a clueless, insignificant obstacle to the (probably mentally unbalanced) mother's extramarital activities.  This shameless, 'no holds barred' look at a dysfunctional family's dirty laundry came across as cowardly and disrespectful.  Personally, the focus should have been on the mother's mental instability and the reasons for her inability to live honestly and authentically but, it failed miserably by not even touching on these issues.",1497744000,11,892,5.3428571428571425

5664182,4,B00BPRI6WG,"Two men love the same woman. One sleeps with her when she is a married woman, and lusts for her for three decades afterward.

The other marries her after she divorced her first husband and she loses custody of the first husband's children. The second husband trusts her enough to have more children with her, then blames himself when the marriage starts to break down. He goes to her in another city and works to recreate their marriage, He does not question the paternity of a pregnancy that resulted when their marriage had been shaky, and loved and raised her last child who did not look like himself. Three decades later, he agrees to humiliate and embarrass himself by reading a script that the last child asks him to read, exposing his deepest secrets and pain, for the world to see.

Who is the ""real"" father? Which father's love was the most genuine for the wife and mother? Will the daughter (the last child) appreciate the man who raised her and show him the love he so deserves while she still can?",1497139200,,1009,4.538461538461538

5664184,1,B00BPRI6WG,"I used to actually like Sarah Polley, but now that I've seen this heartless film, I will never think kindly of her again. Do I feel a little bit sorry for her, in this situation? I feel sorry for the young Sarah who never fit in.... that's where it ends. Her abandonment issues on the subconscious level drove her to punish the one man who actually loved her, even though certain events had taken place.

5664187,4,B00BPRI6WG,"It's not a documentary in the traditional sense, but I didn't mind. I'm not sure how much the filmmaker intended to come through, but this was a complex, honest, very human story with no rough edges smoothed over. The pain we cause one another in a family--even with the best of intentions--was so vivid on each face. Most poignant, to me, was the understanding by the daughter who looks most like her mom: how much her mother had longed for love, and the tragedy that she had to find that love in the arms of another man. And yet the result of that encounter is beautiful, life-affirming....and the reason this film was made. In short, it's complex.  But if you've got a family (and that's most of us) I think you'll recognize pieces of your own story here. With very different details, of course, but a very similar takeaway: these are the people who matter most, even if we never fully know them.",1495843200,3,899,4.515337423312883

5664190,5,B00BPRI6WG,"OMG I loved this documentary and can't wait to tell my friends about it so we can compare notes. Sarah Polley is a genius director, and her...first believed to be???...father is a fantastic writer, though I didn't always like him. This is so touching! I enjoyed everyone's story. By turns comical and tragic, it turned very sad at the end when the full ""cast"" realized, I believe, how much they had loved Sarah's mother, Diane, and how much they missed her after her  untimely death from cancer. The real culprit, in my opinion, was her first husband, who crucified her and her firstborn children by sending her into exile from them, basically stole them from her by grabbing custody under the pretense that she was an ""unfit"" mother, which she was not. So that when it came time for her to break away from her cold second husband Michael to be with someone who truly adored her, she was terrified to do so for fear of losing her losing her kids once again, from her second family. Diane was a truly tragic figure, though she put on a heroic act of high spirits and great generosity to cover her pain. Wow. Just an amazing piece of work. When Polley's father says that she's a ""vicious"" director, that's a great compliment. One of her half-siblings wondered why she needed to do this at all. No mystery for me. Her whole life there had been ""humorous"" rumors in the family that Michael was not her father. So that when she found out that, indeed,Michael was not her father, I believe she was determined that everyone know the truth, to declare her ""legitimacy"" - ironically - by claiming her actual, biological father. Also, she uncovered the indifference and neglect of Michael toward her mother, though others thought they had the ""perfect"" marriage. She wanted people to know that her real father was a good, creative, kindly man whose sorrow at not being able to have her for himself proved that her mother truly had been loved. Good one, Sarah. Congratulations, dear. I admire you so much for making this documentary.",1495497600,5,2022,4.663865546218488

You're let in to her secrets right from the start, but you won't know it until the plot is very well formed.

5664197,5,B00BPRI6WG,"A quick aside: With no plan in place to visit or revisit the work of this still young, prolific, creative talent, Sarah Polley-- that's what happened. In the course of a week, I watched for a 3rd or 4th time the exceptional film ""Take This Waltz,"" (2011), the screenplay and direction hers; ""Guinevere,"" (1999), in which she stars with Stephen Rea; and now this unique documentary (2012), created and directed by her. In honesty, and especially because this one's about truth, I didn't know or remember that 2 of the 3 were hers (not great with names, even famous ones). ""Stories We Tell"" is a bold and brave endeavor to bring clarity and truth to her deceased mother Diane's little-known story and, thereby, her own. She brings her siblings and Diane's contemporaries (and more) together, having asked them to write all that they remember and know about Diane, from beginning to now. Some will read their stories aloud, others recount.  The bravery, in large part, belongs to the participants, the ""storytellers,"" revealing not just Diane's story, but their own. The format becomes that of a lead detective, Sarah, asking that each member of the team lay out their evidence, with the goal of solving the case. So the narratives are singular and the collectivity is their coming together to reveal them. And many secrets are revealed.  And because this is not fiction, and the accounts are emotion-laden and often painful, they elicit strong feelings in the viewer. What makes this piece even more engaging and successful, as a film, is that the participants are wonderfully articulate and expressive, gifted storytellers, all coming together to sift through and make sense of the stories we tell.  Highly recommend.",1491091200,2,1716,4.993006993006993

5664201,3,B00BPRI6WG,"Interesting story although I didn't find the premise of the documentary to be followed through. If the premise was that equal weight is to be given to all sides of the story of the documentary maker's mother, and we would see varying sides to the same story, this did not come through clearly. True, there is some variation to how people viewed events or situations or the mother, but nothing more than a typical documentary would have. There was almost the most weight given to the father, which makes sense in my opinion; it seemed to be more his story than anyone else's. I was okay with this, but again, it seemed the filmmaker was setting out NOT to do this. Also, note that the ""home footage"" is often played by modern actors. I noticed this toward the end when the filmmaker was shown in a scene with the actor who played the mom and you can see there are actors in the credits. This was an interesting choice. Interesting to do this, interesting to give us that quick window of seeing it taking place (but without drawing a lot of attention to it), and interesting a lot of people didn't notice that and think the footage is actual footage. It somehow gives me an eerie feeling--seeing the scenes acted out as though it were real, and kind of fooling the audience.

Like finding an old photo album with pictures of yourself, friends, and family, those you loved from long ago, who come to life and remind you of events and feelings long since forgotten.  Watching this documentary was like rediscovering a past.  How very fortunate for us that these events happened to a family of storytellers, people for whom narrative storytelling (in the most honest terms possible) was second nature- among them filmmakers, writers and actors from different cultures.  Home movies and photos span decades, augmented by family members' and friends' reminiscences.  While the story revolves around a family secret that emerges gradually, organically, the real focus, though ever-shifting and enigmatic, is the specter of Mom as a mysterious young woman, the one person not able to speak for herself.  Subtle, intriguing, utterly original, VERY intimate, and unforgettable.",1487894400,2,903,5.507246376811594

Frankly, as I give my opinion of the film----it is a story about a very vivacious lady who had a great effect on all the players who are 'telling their story' but, in the end----she can't tell her own story.  Too many different perspectives for me, and seemingly produced, only, to fill the void and confusion by the one who made the film.

I guess the biggest lesson coming away from this movie would be to live the truth and be happy because there is only one life we are given and it can end too soon.

The disjointed super-8 style is too clumsy for me and continually distracts from the point. Memory failures are not interesting. I'm sorry. The realities of life for the dead woman and people who loved her are far more poignant than how we tell stories. The children who lost their mother, the husband who didn't love enough and the lover who wasn't the husband are all great stories brought together by an inexperienced and clumsy director who needs more training.

I like Sarah Polley's work which is why I watched it to begin with, she's a very interesting filmmaker and actress. The story unfolds really well, the use of historical footage, what she must have created blended with the interviews worked, nice movement back and forth. The end is just smashing, her father's writing and realizations just wonderful, and I was struck that the last shot with her father did what he did with the first hand held movie cameras ever made. The only thing that took me out a bit was the piano playing at a particular point, it seemed ... not up to par shall we say. This is definitely worth a second look because I suspect there are more nuances to be found. It's always interesting how artists use their art to come to terms with something, or even many things. Perhaps the whole family got to work something out about their history, though the tendency to hold things in or back is definitely there.

5664406,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Painfully good. This movie claims to be about different tellings of the same thing.  Not so.  All points of view -- without ambiguity -- point to the truth, no contradictions.  However, there is the exterior story and then what can be missed: the inner revelation of truth, love, and meaning.  This can be missed.  That ability to discern deeper truth is what the viewer has to bring to the movie and to life.

True Love: To me the movie's revelation can be missed:  her real father is the one who sacrifices himself in the movie for her and for her mom.  Who is her real father is the question.

(Spoiler Alert) Sarah Polley's revelation of her roots is honest and humane. Her wispy girl-like approach as the baby of a complicated dramatic matriarchy is actually her greatest strength:  Her presence as film-maker and her place in the family always has a powerful affect on what the story-tellers say.  This is as it should be.  Her life was a ""mistake"" that seems to demand that everything be made right.  (It appears that her father may have talked her mother out of her abortion on the way to the hospital.)

On a superficial viewing, if you simply take the words as simply true, this father is inadequate, unloving, boring as a fly.  But somehow by the end, it gets through that there are exterior words and appearances and then there are interior and actual love and truth.

It is easy to want the excitment and drama and freedom her mother sought in Montreal and there is nothing wrong with that, but it seems clear to me that her (non-DNA matching) father chose the better way. He proved himself as truely loving Diane and Diane's child as his own.

Sarah does not judge, but neither does she allow one of her fathers to dominate and get his way.  She rightly directs her fathers and so brings wholeness and healing and truth to everyone, no matter how painful and difficult.",1466380800,,1883,4.553571428571429

5664409,3,B00BPRI6WG,"Surprisingly subjective (and probably honest) documentary film by writer-director (and actress) Sarah Polley, which examines the relationship between her own mother Diane (a showy, flamboyant, and vivacious type) and her father Michael (a quiet, literary, unassuming type), and the discovery she makes along the way concerning her real dad--film producer and businessman Harry Gulkin (whom you probably don't remember from the credits of the 1975 movie ""Lies My Father Told Me"").
What makes this documentary so interesting is watching how Polley manages to bring us into the lives of her subjects in ever more in-depth fashion; while the picture is undeniably depressing at times, it still manages to be an inspiring portrait of lives that intersect in strange (and sometimes romantic) ways. See what Harry Gulkin looks like in the present day (still rocking his Albert Einstein hairdo), and get a narrative voice over written as a journal entry by the surviving Michael himself. Much of this is very moving, and every family has a story to tell. Maybe not everyone will care about this family's history, but given the style of the movie alone I'd say that it's a good bet you will be drawn into it. Some may call it pretentious and self aggrandizing, but it's bittersweet nostalgia theme is still somewhat touching overall.
I may consider purchasing this title later on, but for the time being it was an interesting watch--it certainly lags during the last thirty minutes and will undeniably not be for every taste. But for those who care, it is an interesting human experiment in both subjective and objective emotional surrender. The DVD has adequate picture and sound, and is certainly worth a look if you like slowly paced, level-headed documentaries that rely upon interviews and archival footage to achieve their ultimate emotional impact.

5664410,3,B00BPRI6WG,"Here's the story ripped right out of Maureen McGovern's seventies hit ""Torn between two lovers,"" plus one.  You have Diane, a woman whose zest for life masks the deep pain of two unhappy marriages, the loss of her first two children to her first husband, and a women who is unfulfilled in many areas of her life.

Diane is an an aspiring actress who never quite broke through in her career.  She met her second husband Michael while the two were working on a play, and according to Michael, she ""fell in love with his character."" As the film progresses, this appears to be somewhat the case.  Diane and Mike already have two older children when Diane discovers she's pregnant after a two-month acting stint in Montreal.  Diane is not enthusiastic about becoming a mother, and for good reason. Nonetheless she gives birth to a baby girl named Sarah.  After Diane dies from cancer, the older children make off-handed jokes about how their sister Sarah looks  ""nothing like her father,"" and that she bears an uncanny resemblance to Geoff, and actor who worked with Sarah's mother in Montreal. Sarah meets Geoff, and at first appearances one instantly says ""Yep! That's the father!"" However, Geoff denies ever having relations with Diane, but mentions someone who Diane was rumored to have have an affair with: Harry.

Harry is another actor who worked with Diane in Montreal, and unlike Geoff, looks more like Albert Einstein than Sarah.  Through many conversations, Harry reveals that he and Diane had an impassioned love affair and that he may be Sarah's father.  While Sarah is finding out more about Diane's secret life, Michael is totally in the dark.  Which is pretty much how he was during the whole marriage.

This story could have been ripped from a Maury episode, had it not been a pretty sad tale.  It's hard to rip and roar with laughter when it's apparent that Diane was truly unhappy as a person and in marriage, which caused her to look for other men to get what she missed at home.  Michael was an epic failure of a husband, who broke down his wife's confidence because he just wasn't there.  By his own admission he relates more to flies than with people, and was content with fading into his own background.

Contrast Michael with Harry, a man who was madly in love with Diane.  A man who saw her worth, and even wanted her to move to Montreal to be with him.  In the grander scheme of things she could ran with him  and lived happily ever after, but as with most instances, the married lover isn't going to leave the spouse.  The saddest (and happiest) things about Harry is that Diane found the love she needed, but it was Michael's love she really wanted.  As with most affairs Harry gets burned, and loses both Diane and Sarah, who was proven to be his daughter.

""The stories we tell"" is a long-winded documentary that drags on without really getting to the point.  Did she make the documentary to find out more about herself, or was it to understand why her mother made the choices she did?  Well, her mother wasn't getting her needs met in marriage and she found someone else to fulfill them.  She is the result of an affair, and she's not the first one who is. This story plays out more times than people admit.

I was a little miffed by Harry.  Harry wanted the documentary to be one between he and Diane, where love that could have flourished was cut short by her running back home.  He has an affair with a married woman, gets her pregnant, and expects the story to be two-sided when there's multiple sides to it?  My gut tells me that had the truth came out when Sarah was a baby, Harry would have taken that rejection and used it against Sarah by being an absentee dad.  His whole tone with Sarah took an entirely different tone when the story wasn't solely about him.

The teachable moment here is if you're unhappy, find the happiness you seek. But remember, the risks you take to find it hurt may innocent people around you.  Also, condoms and birth control pills wouldn't hurt.",1458518400,,4009,4.571428571428571

5664482,3,B00BPRI6WG,"""Stories We Tell"" is not fiction but not quite documentary either, as it is not so much about documenting anything as it is a journey through the recollections of one family and their friends, finding its purpose as it goes along, if it has a purpose at all. The film was made by Canadian actress and filmmaker Sarah Polley about her own family, in particular her mother Diane, who died when Polley was eleven years old, leaving five mostly grown children, a husband Michael, and apparently some family secrets. Diane's story, what we know of it, is told through interviews with her children -John and Susy from her first marriage, Mark and Joanna from her second, with husband Michael Polley, a talented British actor who settled into a job in insurance when he took on the responsibilities of a family, much to Diane's disappointment, interviews with friends, old home movies, and reenactments meant to look like home movies.

Sarah Polley admits that she was not clear on what the film would be about while she was making it. Unfortunately, the finished product doesn't clear that up. It begins as though Polley is trying to reconstruct an image of her mother, a vivacious woman with a big personality, the epitome of an extrovert, who married a very introverted man whom she had idealized when she worked with him in the theater, but who proved unable to meet her emotional needs after they married. After Diane dies, the film takes a turn. Brother John overheard a conversation while his mother was alive that brought Sarah's paternity into question. The family made jokes about it. At some point, Sarah begins to take the rumors seriously, and the film's scope broadens. Michael is narrating the story by reading from his memoir, while Sarah is crafting a similar storyline from the interviews.

Strangely, this is captivating. These are ordinary people speaking mostly candidly about a family drama that is essentially mundane. I wondered why I cared. But I cannot deny that this meandering exploration of Diane's life, loves, and their consequences kept my attention for nearly two hours. I credit Sarah Polley and editor Mike Munn for that. In the end, I concluded that the film is not really about anything beyond what you see. The picture that it paints of Diane is more of her relationships than of her. Sarah Polley has called the film ""an interrogation process"". She puts forth that ""we must be unintentionally distorting things to varying degrees in order to feed our own version of what we need the past and history to be"", but this doesn't come off in the film. No one disagrees about Diane's or Michael's character. Even Michael's spontaneous statements in interviews reveal nothing different than his thoughtful and practiced narration.

In a sense, I felt that Polley missed the boat, because Harry Gulkin, a film producer who was Diane's lover for a time, never got to tell his story. He was interviewed, shared his opinions of the film project, spoke of the logistics of he and Diane's relationship. But Diane was a great love in his life who affected him deeply. Gulkin resented Polley's plea that he not share that story until everyone else could share their version of Diane, because he was hopeful that he could finally express his deep feelings publicly after decades of silence. To him, the family's perception of Diane is tangential to his epic, private love story. But he doesn't tell that story in this film, which is a shame, because  Diane played a wholly different role for him. A different narrative for a different role might have lent the film some semblance of a theme. Can Diane's double life be fit together like a jigsaw puzzle? ""Stories We Tell"" has an uncanny ability to keep the audience's attention, but it falls short.",1439251200,,3764,4.849144634525661

No. If you watch it you will participate in the filmed and at times tedious unraveling of the filmmaker's family.  From the time her sister asks, ""why the f*** would anyone want to watch a film about our family,"" Sarah Polley presses on, filming her father as he narrates the family story, and adding film footage taken by mother, father, brothers and sisters. We never really find out why Sarah did this film. We know it must have hurt some friends and family members more than others.  We can't be sure it really helped anyone.  If the parent is the one who raised us from infancy to adulthood, who clothed us, nurtured us, protected, and loved us; why is it so important to find a biological father and thereby hurt and diminish our true parent in the process.

While it didn't so much bother me, as it confused me, several of the people interviewed weren't identified.  So I had a hard time keeping people straight and knowing what their role in the story was.  Sometimes you just have to be patient and let it all come together.
Beyond that, I loved it.  For starters, I found each of the family members likeable people.  They were open and honest, and I appreciated their sense of humor.  They made me laugh, they made me cry, and they made me reflect on my own life and family.

5664528,5,B00BPRI6WG,"I just finished watching this, and I am in awe.  To call it ""genre-bending,"" as I've read it described, is an understatement.
While clearly structured as a documentary, the story being documented - the director's search for information about her late mother and incidental discovery of her biological father - is joined by a much larger story when the fourth wall is broken and the question becomes: ""what is this film really about?""  The director herself suggests that it's about how people talking about the same thing (i.e., the director's mother in the late '70's) tell very different stories. Does this, as her biological father claims, fog the truth and undermine the truth-telling purpose of a documentary? For me, it did the opposite; the various stories ended up painting a more complete and deeply complex portrait of the director's late mother - a person who everyone thought they knew so well because she routinely gave unfiltered expression to her innermost thoughts and emotions, but who is discovered (decades after her death) to have kept a secret so big that few people could have pulled it off.  Then, just when you think you know what this film is about, the credits roll and a whole new aspect of the the ""meta-story"" is revealed. It's been a long time since I've seen a film where reading the credits caused me to re-think the entire story. Kudos.

PS Note to the director, if you ever read this - Michael's writing credit should have been moved up to share a card with you.  His belated realization of Diane's dream for him was the most moving part of the otherwise academic meta-story. And I feel sure that Harry deserved some kind of writing credit also. He may not have a monopoly on the truth, as he believed, but he was certainly the emotional center of the main documentary story",1431475200,,1807,4.74203821656051

5664532,5,B00BPRI6WG,"It is small wonder that Sarah Polley has tremendous ability as an actress, director and writer. She was surrounded by both nature and nurture by all incredibly talented and intelligent people with those same talents. She became a child actress in Canada and then easily transitioned to a fuller role in film as an adult. Her extended family is a revelation for anyone to behold. That is the subject of this documentary. These are the stories told by her and her family members of the family.

The fulcrum for these stories is the one who has been dead the longest. Sarah's mother died when she was 11. But it was she who was the center for all of these people. She had a larger than life personality and people were drawn to her almost magically. She too was an actress but did not have as much talent (or maybe as much focus) as Sarah does.

Her mother also led a complex life and kept secrets, very interesting secrets, which come out in this documentary. Sarah Polley couldn't have invented anything as interesting as the stories that were there within her own extended family. It is all fascinating.",1431129600,,1103,4.593908629441624

5664570,4,B00BPRI6WG,"This is a documentary about the late Canadian actress Diane Polley, directed by her daughter Sarah Polley, in which several family members and friends tell 'their story' about Diane. It starts out slow, and I was close to give up, fearing it would just turn into a hommage to 'wonderful and life-loving Diane' to be enjoyed by a smaller circle of family/friends/fans. However, viewers will soon be rewarded by something that unfolds into an intimate, moving and interesting drama, that kept me thinking a lot about our lives and relationsships and how they change (slowly or abruptly) over time, and how little we might know about a person 'behind a happy mask', even a family member or close friend.

So, what keeps me from giving it a 5?  Well, I felt that the film, at least towards the end got a bit too repetitive on the theme of 'interpretation', claiming that the different narrators had so very different views on what happened, and how impossible it is to even get close to the truth of what happened. I mean this theme even gives the film its name: Stories (plural form) we tell!
Come on! To me, the narrators pretty much told the same story, not least the two main narrators (step-dad and the biological dad).
I mean, even the step-dad, who you might expect to dislike the biological dad and tell a totally different more self-centered story, was rather 'objective' and 'factual', e.g. showing no scorn toward the biological dad, rather the contrary, i.e. displaying quite a lot of understanding and compassion toward him.
Who knows, perhaps his 'true' feelings went through some social filter, knowing that this would be broadcasted?
On the other hand, I felt that the  biological dad was rather selfish in stating that only he (and the deceased main character) really could tell the true story. As I see it, this wasn't ONLY a film about THEIR love affair, but about the lives of several people who knew Diane and lived with her.",1426032000,2,1942,4.756676557863502

Sarah Polley (or one of her siblings) asked why would anyone be interested in their family. The answer is that there's no real reason. There was nothing different about this family than any of ours. Personally, I liked peaking into their window. Without giving anything away I would have to say there is nothing so exceptional on the contrary they were no different than any of us. I wondered how my family would discuss me and my imperfections. Would my imperfections cause them shame? Would the decisions I've made leave them with disdain for me?

In this story there were reasons for anger but they seemed to be more grounded and accepting of the things they couldn't change. I've had a situation quite similar to this in my life and once my anger subsided I realized there was nothing I could do and eventually found peace.

So much navel gazing, it seemed self serving, though it's true other people found the story interesting based on the many positive reviews, just not me. There must have been someone willing to speak ill of the dead, but you won't find them being interviewed for this documentary.  Maybe a better question would be, ""How was this woman able to charm everyone around her so much that she is instantly forgiven, and forever revered for her vivaciousness?""  Maybe Canadians are more about cult of personality than responsibility?  I actually didn't hear anyone describe a tangible way her husband was unloving to this woman--unless you consider it unloving to  take care of the kids and home while she went to Montreal for months to perform in a show and live the life she thought she ought to be living instead.  I also didn't enjoy finding out much of the footage was staged (clever), but by that time I was already annoyed by so many other things, it didn't make the top 3.  In retrospect, I'm dying to hear the story the way Harry would have told it, because it's GOT to be more interesting than this telling.  And I thought it was telling Ms. Polley was so defensive about it being her story to tell in the way she thought best.

Lots of superfluous interviews. Wasn't funny, wasn't sad, not very interesting as far as ""family secrets"" go. Just an unnecessary, tasteless, self-indulgent project by someone who i guess didn't have any better ideas than to air her family's laundry in public. The two older men involved, very classy and kind, appeared to be just indulging their immature daughter by participating in this foolishness. Ach, i'm sure others thought it was great.

5664597,2,B00BPRI6WG,"I can't give this more than 2 stars, because I was disappointed with the reenactments.  There was an awful lot of 8mm footage.  I figured there was so much because the whole family along with friends were in the theatre community that they would be taking more footage than others at that time.  However, there was the scene at the funeral and I became suspicious.  But I was so trusting at the beginning.  Perhaps this is what the director wanted because she was lied to and was trusting, but it completely skewed my view of the ""documentary.""

I found her storytelling confusing.  It wasn't until the middle that we discover two of the siblings were children from a first marriage of the wife and they lived with their father after mom lost custody.  I never understood if these kids ever went to live with the director's father although they seem close to him and call him ""dad.""  It didn't make any sense as the documentary indicated the mom didn't have parenting time with the first two children very often.

I was particularly touched that the director and her father bonded so closely after the mother died.  It was wonderful that the two could have each other to lean on in tough times.  It might have been different if the family had known who the real father was and the daughter went to live with her real father after the mom's death.  I felt sad for both dads.  I felt sorry for the father who raised her because he had a difficult and uneven life with his wife, and that he loved a child he found out wasn't his own.  I also felt sorry for the real dad who would have liked to have been in the director's life sooner.  I felt for him that he had an intense relationship with the mother.  However, I agree with another reviewer that based on her history of husbands and cheating on them multiple times that it is likely the ""honeymoon"" period with the mother would not have lasted.  I'm sure he would have liked to have tried, but seems like it might not have worked out.  I felt sorry for the real dad who thought the story was the story of the mom and him and wanted to tell that story --- but the daughter wouldn't let him.  She was upset with him for wanting to tell it and caused some emotional turmoil for him so he backed off.  I also felt sorry for the dad that wrote his first (novel? screenplay?) manuscript after years of wanting to write something interesting and the daughter didn't take his approach 100%, either (although probably more of his than the other dad.)

Toward the end, I felt like the daughter hijacked the storytelling from both of the men and then ended up putting something together that was not what either wanted and disappointing in its dishonesty (the 8mm clips) and at loose ends at the end.  Seems like the mother should have not gotten married, used birth control, and then we wouldn't have a room full of people hurt and saddened by her actions.

The other is dead so we can't get her take on the life she lived and the reasons for the choices she made. But Sarah wisely gathers stories from others impacted by her mother's life and death. The film is much richer for it highlighting that our lives and the memories of our interactions with each other have deep impacts in ways that we can identify and many that we cannot.

Perhaps I'm confused by thinking all visuals were actual footage of times past; but it perhaps was crafted so well that the actual and acted seamlessly blend.

The story itself takes the twists and turns of a suspenseful drama. Perhaps again that comes from the ignorance of avoiding the synopsis or reviews; but you come away realizing this is a story of someone/something else.  And perhaps the catalyst of this ""documentary""(?) does, as well.

Like many of us with ""interesting"" family stories, there exists one defining event. It is not necessarily an event that changes everything. It is more the event that is a reflection of everything. It magnifies the core dynamics of a family and the offspring produced therein.

Diane and her second husband were actors, so there was a lot of home movie footage interspersed throughout the story, even from her funeral.  This was an element that brought Diane uniquely to life as her family and friends reminisced.

This piece is nothing but narrative voices against an excellent visual background.  These are real people, sometimes struggling, telling the story of their mother/wife/lover.  It is a complete success in drawing you into their world and holding your attention.  I considered giving it five stars.

Its limitation, I think, is that the mother's secrets were not all that remarkable, far from it, actually.  Most of life is, I suppose, not all that remarkable -- the familiar dramatic themes of domestic life tend to play out again and again, which is not to say that we ever should or ever will lose interest in them.  But I was somehow set up for some more surprising events that became secrets.  I also thought that the film was not really successful in the effort to demonstrate the familiar phenomenon of different observers coming away with different stories -- there was not much disagreement.

5664692,3,B00BPRI6WG,"My (Shannon Johnson) review is what I wrote to my husband about this film:

Tonight I picked a movie I knew nothing about, just something that came up on a list of Amazon prime recommendations. I recall hearing a movie critic recommend walking into a theater and seeing a movie you know nothing about--no previews, nothing--and getting to the have the experience of just sitting down and watching, without any preconceived notions. So I decided to give it a try.

Well this film, Stories We Tell, turned out to be a documentary-drama with cut and pasted interviews supposedly from an entire family and circle of friends, as the film-maker attempted to ""give equal weight"" to everyone's version of a story in their lives, the story of the film-maker's real parentage and her discovery of it. I skipped some, since it had a very boring beginning and really dragged in parts, but the over-all story, as a human story, was interesting enough to watch large sections. The story is the documentary maker's story about her discovery that she is really the biological child of an affair her actress-mother had--something everyone in the family had joked about since she was a teenager, but she doesn't discover until long after her mother's death. So, that story of discovery is interesting.... it is a complicated story of life, of lies, of love, of so many things, which is at least mildly interesting and provoking.

However, the documentary itself was horribly done, as the film-maker gives the impression that she never really understood what she was doing or why she was doing it. She claims that the documentary is ""about memory and the way we tell stories""--which sounds totally boring, and indeed, that shallow purpose is part of what makes the whole thing drag. But it is also not really her true intention--and even her dad calls her out on that, suggesting it's about something deeper related to her search for truth and understanding of herself...but since she never figures that out, she never really puts together a compelling and unified piece, a piece that moves forward with a strong intention. And so it drags. I think this is also a criticism offered in the film by her biological father, who wanted to tell the story himself, without a million other people's perspectives. I think he is at least partly correct in his idea that a story can't be told by an entire panel of people. He thinks it's HIS story to tell, and his alone. I think the film may have worked if the young woman had really took ownership of it and made it HER story to tell. But she doesn't. Instead, it remains cut-and-pasted pieces that she lumps together in a sort of chronological order, but it has a very disjointed feeling. There is no driving intention. It is her (or her character's) own messy way of trying to understand her life and her mother, but she never cleans up the mess.

I think the film is modern in this sense, with modern problems. The maker didn't really know what she was doing, or why (or she thinks it is good to appear that way), which reflects the modern idea that art can just be thrown together, that you don't have to know what you are doing beforehand, that you don't have to have an end in mind (or that the end can be arbitrary, whatever the viewer wants it to mean), that you can just start scribbling or throwing paint on a canvas and whala! You think you have a masterpiece, but it's really a bunch of garbage. (Imagine Michelangelo trying to sculpt that way! There would be no Pieta, I assure you! Michelangelo had to have an end result in his mind's eye in order to begin any stroke on the statue. Any artist should be just as disciplined. All the sketches and brainstorms may begin without knowing the end, but they are the process of figuring that out--a process that viewers don't need to see, because they get to see the final, finished piece.) This documentary is the brainstorming process only, with no finished masterpiece or anything close to it.

In conclusion, I found the story itself interesting for the prompted reflection on the complicated nature of people's lives, but it is frustrating that the film feels thrown together, with no real guiding force, no strong intention, no moral purpose. Ah, that last one is probably what is really missing! A story without a higher point.

Compare it to a completed work, like the Roger Scruton documentary on Beauty, and one can see the disparity clearly. Scruton knew what he was doing and why he was doing it. He takes viewers on an intentional guided journey, and he knows the destination and reason for the journey. He has done his homework beforehand and carefully figured out what he wants to say and why. This young woman/character was in the midst of her own journey and just leaves us in her own muddle, which is disappointing and very unfinished. It feels like a cop out. Too easy. Evasive. Incomplete.",1414195200,,4888,4.684516880093131

5664708,1,B00BPRI6WG,"After the first viewing I loved this documentary. It was amazingly well-crafted and a powerful EMOTIONAL story that brought me to tears.

But then I started THINKING and upon further reflection realized how dishonest the film was at its core.

The main character of this film was a dead person who couldn't speak for herself. She also happened to be the director's own mother who died when the director was 11 years old. As people tend to do, they romanticize the dead and forget all their flaws. In this movie we are manipulated into believing the mother was just a happy-go-lucky, full-of-life woman who was just looking to be loved. (By the way, all the ""home movies"" that showed this ""full-of-life"" woman were actually RECREATIONS using ACTORS.) But in reality, when you think of this woman's actual behavior you realize she was rather a self-absorbed, self-centered narcissist who cared first and foremost about her own happiness and physical pleasure.

For instance, we are told that the first man she married was too controlling and that she only married him because he was the type of guy she thought her parents would want her to marry. This marriage soon turned loveless and she began having an affair with an actor who she became smitten with after seeing him in a play. Because of her adultery, she lost custody of the kids to their father. Yet the director spends quite a bit of effort manipulating us into believing this was just so unfair to her mother. But had the father been the adulterer I don't think there would be much sympathy for him. And based on her future adulterous affairs it appears the judge got it right: this woman was more concerned about herself, her career, and her own needs than the needs of her children. In fact, her children are then abused by their stepmother and we're manipulated into feeling sorry for the MOTHER because it ""must have been hard for her not to be able to protect her children""?!?!? I guess she wasn't thinking much of her children when she was busy cheating on their father and what the consequences for THEM might be, right? RIGHT?????

Let's look at more of the evidence of what a wonderful woman she was....

She has more children with her next husband....the actor she cheated with during her first marriage. But he claims she was more in love with the CHARACTER he was playing than with the real him. He was the opposite of this character and so she again feels unfulfilled, moves away from the family to further her acting career, and has affairs with two other men. One of these affairs leads to a pregnancy. Does she stay with her new love? Nope. She goes back to her husband and then fools him into raising another man's child as his own thereby denying the child the right to know her real father and financially obligating her responsible husband for the care of another man's child. This child just so happens to be the director of this documentary.

All the interviews wax poetic about how this woman was just unfulfilled and looking for love and how glad they were that she was able to find a bit of that love before she died by having this adulterous affair. Of course, based on her past actions it's likely she would have gotten bored with this ""love"" too and would have eventually cheated on him as well had their relationship led to marriage. But of course we'll never know because she stayed with her husband and then died 11 years later.

We're told over and over how much of a victim this woman was when in fact, the truth seems just the opposite. It appears she was the VICTIMIZER and the men and children in her life were the ultimate victims. Was her first husband really too controlling or was he simply trying to have her live up to her responsibilities as a mother and wife and stop being a party girl? We never got his point of view so we'll never know the truth. If she wanted her freedom why didn't she just stay single and pursue her career? Why get a husband and children involved? That seems to have been HER choice. As was having an adulterous affair which caused her to lose custody of her kids. If her first husband was so horrible, she could have simply divorced him, gotten custody, and then started work on a new life. But she didn't. And for that she paid the same price a man would have paid had he been the adulterer in a divorce proceeding: she lost custody. Boo-hoo!

You would think after her first failed marriage she would try to get to know the next man a little better so she could avoid all the heartbreak for herself and MOST IMPORTANTLY for her children. But did she? Nope. She once again got all tingly when she saw this handsome actor and fell in love with the character he was playing and NOT the real man. Once again, she gets married to someone she doesn't really know, has kids with him, falls out of love with him and then has a couple of affairs, one of which leads to a pregnancy.

Does she own up to her mistake and either get an abortion or tell her husband the truth? Oh no...she lies and convinces him its his child. So the man of questionable character who has sex with another man's wife and doesn't even have the sense to wear a condom gets off scott-free from financially and emotionally supporting the life he helped create. And the responsible man who'd put his own dreams on hold in order to get a higher paying job in order to raise a family is the one who is duped into paying for another man's child.

And then once this child grows up the sperm donor father gets to waltz in and be the big hero for having loved her mother the way her father couldn't or wouldn't?!?!?! And now HE gets to have a relationship with a child he never made any effort in having a relationship with during her entire childhood....when diapers needed to be changed. When homework needed to be done. When clothes and cars needed to be paid for. When college needed to be paid for. Once all the REAL work has been done, the man who had no moral compass and had unprotected sex with another man's wife gets to be the freaking hero of the story???????????????

And to top it all off, the first thing all three of these people (the sperm donor, director daughter, & real father) think when the real truth comes out is: how can I profit from this by writing a book or a screenplay because it's ""such a good story""?!?!? Wow. Truly a family that deserves each other.

Yes, it's a great STORY. But that's all it is....a story. Like Lion King or Gladiator. It's not the truth and there's nothing to learn from it. It's just a story. A meaningless story.",1412726400,20,6556,4.476987447698745

5664730,5,B00BPRI6WG,"I loved this story.  After reading a brief narrative about the film I had a sense that it might resonate as there have been some family skeletons let loose from my family closet after the deaths of my mother in 2002 and, more recently, my oldest sister.  There was a playful but poignant flavor to this film that gave service to the conflicted feelings and new perspectives that emerge from the closet along with all those skeletons.

We make sense of everyday events for ourselves in relation to others in a way that takes on a story form and is connected to feelings.  In other words, we pull together what is emotionally meaningful to us.  We are then able to tell others about our experience, engage their interest, share meanings, and, in so doing, enlarge or co-construct new meanings.  Affective meaning making in narratives, both for ourselves and for sharing with others, is a vital human endeavor.  Robert Emde",1411171200,2,920,4.748427672955975

5664737,2,B00BPRI6WG,"This is a film about how documentaries are made. It forefronts its interest in form early on with a series of shots showing the upcoming ""interviewees"" who, as several helpful reviewers have pointed out, are actors and not Polley's actual relatives.

I love the formal experimentalism here. For me where it doesn't succeed, though, is in its method. It isn't slick enough. The film doesn't seem to be aware that many of its actors sound the same. They sound as if they're saying lines written by the same hand and they're too supportive and tightly fit to the putative storyline. If all these things were intentional, the film would have to be sending up fictional documentaries themselves, which would be pretty futile.

No, the target is documentary style filmmaking, and even if Polley does use a couple of her real family members, the intended effect, as the Atwood quote that opens the film reveals, is to get the viewer to think more closely about how we shape the randomness of life experience into these coherent wholes we call stories; something I would've been more willing to do had the film trusted itself and its actors a bit more and not tried so hard to convince with all the perfectly matched cuts to home movies and homogenized speakers.",1410566400,,1254,4.774193548387097

She individually records and documents family members' stories in effort to learn more about her mother, understand other's perception of her, and seemingly to learn family secrets that may be lurking.  Because many inconsistencies of life happenings were not discussed, shared, or communicated, I pondered if it might become controversial amongst them all, yet it was handled delicately and maturely.

But, overall, I think it is an important work. It does not preach its own insight, but searches for it; and in the search the viewer begins to have insight ...into their own relationships, whether similar to the problem being examined or simply any human relationship with complications. Complications are what relationships present. Working these through is what builds each of us into what we are. We become part of a web formed by and connected to others. None of us are truly individuals. We are the sum of all of our contact with others, our responses to this, and, too, all that we fear. We are sustained by all that we know and hold dear, that  which brings reason to our life. At least this is what I was thinking during this story.

For those who dismiss this as boring or slow or who say that there are other more interesting stories to tell, I recommend the Transformers franchise. For those who have an interest in the narratives we project onto the events of our lives or who can appreciate artistic honesty, this movie is a true thriller. This is an unearthing of a family secret, that secret's discovery and the unraveling and reconstruction of the narrative that holds a family together. Polley is right that this is an interrogation. Michael is right that it's not the interrogation she thinks it is. Everyone is vulnerable and empathetic. This movie is gripping in how the plot unfolds, provocative in its examination of how people live through their faults and triumphs, and brave in its honesty. As art, it is utterly masterful in its execution, never cliche, self-pitying, self-adulatory or tricky.

Furthermore, the metaphor of creating a family history exploring the various meanderings and escapades of the deceased mother -- and involving the active participation of the children from her various marriages, together with her widower/cuckold and ""boyfriend"" -- made this movie increasingly painful to watch.

5664828,3,B00BPRI6WG,"This is a very earnest look at the truth about the birth father of the flim maker, using home movie footage and interviews to flesh out the story of a happy-go-lucky mother and her stoic, responsible husband. The mother's death of cancer in the prime of her life leaves her mate a single parent, but did he really father her last-born child? The film perhaps dwells too much on the journey and does not explore deeply enough how the ambiguity of the now-grown girl's parentage has affected her life and world-view. In fact, I decided to stop watching about 3/4 of the way through because there was no sense of trajectory. It is a commendable effort even though flawed.",1407024000,,668,4.621848739495798

Three days later I was looking for a new film to watch and came to this movie again.  So I restarted it and also Goggled the reviews for a clue to what I was missing.  The reviews all praised it in nebulous ways.  Truly this movie has a very low speed unimpressive start.  But after a while the main character becomes apparent, Diane an actress and mother with amazing energy for life and love.  She is seen in home movies segments between interviews with her family and friends piecing together how complex she was.

The last 15 minutes seem to be a self analysis by the film maker and each of her family members, because they all failed to communicate, until now to know the truth about, Diane.

I think it displayed the really light and deft touch that she shows in all her work. I hope she makes more films in all her capacities, I think she brings grace to the screen as an actor, director and semi-documentarian.

5664952,1,B00BPRI6WG,"Newsflash - this is NOT a documentary. Turns out that of all the ""stories we tell"", the biggest whopper is by Sarah Polley herself. Hint: documentaries do not have a cast. After watching this, with my jaw dropping several times during the video, it really hit the floor at the very end when credits rolled:

Rebecca Jenkins as Diane Polley
Peter Evans as Michael Polley

Wait... what???!!! The sisters, brothers, everyone, all played by actors.

All those ""home movies"" of mom, leading the viewer to believe we really are seeing intimate glimpses of their life - yup, all produced, made to look like old home movies.

Apparently there really is a Harry Gulkin, and apparently he really is Sarah's father. But by duping the viewer into believing we are seeing the real people, Polley has crossed the line. Looking into the eyes of Michael Polley as he pours his heart out, we really feel privy to a glimpse of humanity. Gotcha! The guy's a shill.

All you had to do was inform the viewer that you're using actors.

This is a movie based on fact. How much fact vs fiction we will never know, because Polley is clearly capable of distorting the truth to suit her whimsy. As a filmmaker she damn well knows the distinction between documentary and scripted film. It's also an indictment of all the documentary funders listed in the credits, that helped get this MOVIE made while still calling it a documentary.

Shame on you Sarah Polley. If you had been up front about it rather than duping viewers, the many elements of humanity so deftly illustrated in your story would stand on their own. Now the whole message is undermined by your dirty trick.",1404086400,5,1644,4.6678200692041525

Initially, Diane comes across as a bubbly young woman, the kind who always the life of the party--and if there is no party, she brings one with her.  Polley was quite young when her mother died of cancer (11, I believe), and she seems to have begun the film as a means of finding out more about her, interviewing family members and friends who are asked to tell their stories about Diane.  Along the way, she uncovers some dark secrets and surprising sacrifices and even learns some very important things about herself.  Most of the actual persons involved in Diane's story appear as themselves, but scenes of the younger Diane and others, which appear to be home movies, are actually dramatized and newly filmed.

5665009,4,B00BPRI6WG,"This documentary film Sarah Polley wrote about her own family drew me in and didn't let go. Each family member tells his/her side of the story, and you will say ""Boy, I didn't see that one coming"" at least once.",1402963200,,211,4.3
5665010,3,B00BPRI6WG,"This was an interesting if puzzling film to watch.  Sarah Polley has been a favorite of mine since ""Sweet Hereafter"" but she fell down a few notches with this ""documentary"" which she wrote and directed about her questionable biological paternal heritage.  She gets an answer by the end, but  there's something artificial and non-doc about her journey and its effect on her family.  This doubt is especially aroused during the credits, when it is shown that many of the people portrayed are actually actors pretending to be those people.  Too narcisistic.",1402876800,,554,5.043956043956044
5665011,1,B00BPRI6WG,"This needed editing, in my opinion. Too many long, silent scenes about not very much of importance to the story. The time in the studio recording her Dad at the start, for example, went on way too long. I also never really ""fell in love"" with her mother as a character in a way that got me invested in the story - so I think some skillful cuts could have made this a much better film.",1402876800,3,384,4.065789473684211
5665012,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Polley does an amazing job at weaving reality into and through fantasy in order to retell the center-stage story of her family (at least in her generation). While the story may seem to slow down in places it never loses sight of the central premise and therefore remains not only relevant to the story but also interesting to the audience.

The cinematography and editing are the strong point in the film with Polley's careful selection and making-up of actors to portray out-of-age-sequence video segments creating a seamless flow to the story and the film itself. I was surprised that it wasn't until the later segments of the film that I realized the interspersing of the fantasy portions with the real videos. Kudos to Polley and her team.

As for the relevance of her family's story to the rest of the families watching the film, allow me to posit that we all probably have some portion of our families that have undergone related stories, in some way or another, and the story premise of ""acceptance"" becomes a thematic that I carried away from watching the film and the realization remains with me still.

A well worthwhile effort and time and resources well spent!",1402876800,,1172,4.792079207920792

5665018,5,B00BPRI6WG,"This film is very touching and moving; just a beautifully delicate unfolding of life notes played with care and curiosity.
[Spoilers Warning]
From the perspective of a woman and mother myself, I identify with Sarah Polley's mother, Diane MacMillan,and get the strong sense that she never had the love communicated to her fully from the man she truly loved, meanwhile two men tried to love her, the first being her second husband, Michael Polley, and the second being Sarah Polley's father, Harry Gulkin, but each lacked something in themselves, had self-doubt, and so she made do and suffered. To be the one full of life, and dancing to the music that the love of your life sits and listens to in a room alone, is a scene I know well. This does not mean the gulf of grief from this silence can be replaced by the passion and love of another. It is a testament to how much love she felt that she allowed Sarah's father so into her heart. Although, I can see instantly why she would not leave her second husband after losing her children to her first husband. No matter what love she might have felt for Sarah's father, it is logical that, as she had her trust violated by her first husband and the fallout of losing her children to him, the strong notion that she might likely lose her other children as well, she would never leave a husband she had children with again. That said, it seems likely she did love him truly. The second the statement was made by her second husband that she could take a lover if she wanted, just as long as she didn't leave him and the children, because he knew he was so withdrawn that he was starving her heart, but did not want to lose her, nor did he have the heart to express his love more...this part struck me as the moment I knew she loved him and the downward spiral of rejection in which that statement must have sent her. The love of my life said something similar. It is a dreadful thing to hear, as though we are objects easily transposable onto others. The truth seems, if only Michael Polley had given the love back to her that she shined on him, the affair never would have happened, Sarah never would have been born, her career and this film never made. Beauty can definitely rise from tragedy and the pain and respect from Sarah for her mother and fathers is palpable. I have felt this gulf of loving a cold man, and instead of marking against Diane, remark that it is a warning for people, especially men, to give out and reflect the love they receive before their life story also turns into one that also cannot be told clearly by them.",1402790400,,2585,4.410041841004184
5665019,3,B00BPRI6WG,"It's difficult to watch because it feels like everybody in it is naked.  The main subject is finding out who is really Sarah's biological father.  It's not the dad she was raised by and it turns out not to be the other expected party either.  This group of people agreed to make this emotionally raw film together in little bits of separate one on one interviews that took place over a period of time and each one is kind of like peeling a scab off of a wound -- each time you get a little bit deeper into it.  You can feel the internal squirming of some of the people being interviewed as some of them are not comfortable revealing secrets or how they feel about the subjects.  It feels a little raw for some of them.  Some things are revealed about Sarah's mom and it's hard not to judge her and label her but ultimately you see her as another wounded human being just trying to do the best that she can in the difficult situations that she's helped create called her life.  At one point she chooses her personal freedom but has to give up her children as a result of that choice.  Later she gives up a man she loves because she does not want to lose her second family.  When Sarah does find her biological father, it turns out it is not whom she and everyone else suspected that it was.  Turns out he is not surprised that she is his daughter - he knew it all along.  But he is thrilled and full of joy that Sarah now knows and wants her to be in his life.  The dad who raised Sarah is wounded and hurt by the threat of Sarah's biological father even though he had been participating in these interviews and her quest from the beginning.  It seems that no one had considered the ripple effects of this discovery via this movie making idea - that it would become public knowledge, their friends and family would know.  It seems that Sarah's dad didn't mind that Sarah's mom had another mans child while they were married - he just didn't want everyone else to know about it.

The movie is hard to watch sometimes because you can't help but empathize with all of the characters and how they feel about what is happening.  You also find yourself wondering if Sarah's mother was still alive if this movie would've still been made and if it was how she would feel about it.  I think if I were Sarah's mom I'd be glad she waited until I was gone to make this movie - it would be difficult to justify my choices and make all the apologies I'd need to.  On the other hand, maybe Sarah's mom could finally be with the man she really loved since all the kids are grown and everyone knows the truth.",1402790400,,2591,4.242362525458248

""Stories We Tell"" is an ode to the complexity of our perception of reality and the way individuals in an interrelated group have different perspectives (and different narratives) for the same set of actions.  Further, it is a reflection about how relatively little we know about other people and how our assumptions shape our own inner lives.

In the film, characters accidentally discover unknown truths, and these discoveries lead to personal changes of life, altered self images and generally painful growth.

If this sounds dour, it is truly not.  For me, at least, it was a very positive and life affirming experience, and a reminder that our internal storey of our life is probably not entirely accurate.",1402444800,,834,4.886524822695035

I lost interest because the over educated Canadian family have leached emotion from their middle class speech. The father(s) are more interesting, having been artists and come from a different time period. This is a daughter's search for the ""truth"" about her mother's life before the last daughter is born. Oddly, no one ever quotes anything the mother actually said. I found that odd. But the absence of quotes from the mother, I found myself missing her presence. Diane. I wish your daughter had found a way to give you a voice in this story. There's something subtle missing in this documentary. I think it's Diane. A woman the director, and daughter, never knew as an adult. But since the director is a woman, I wish she'd probed for evidence of her mother's point of view on her own life. The end is worth waiting for. Maybe hang in for 70% of this film until you give up. I cried listening to the father's talk about their enduring love for one woman.

Illegitimacy is not unusual in this strangely prudish Nation with all of its hypocrisy and stringent and unrealistic views on sexuality bred by religious oppression and persecution in its early history  This film deals with the fallout from it in another English speaking Nation.  How prevalent is this statistically???  Probably much higher than anybody would admit!  Master's and Johnson's Study only scratched the surface.  I, for one, believe the institution of marriage is going extinct as human moral values changed over the past 60 or 70 years in the West.

I really, really wanted to like this film, but it just didn't resonate with me - it didn't go anywhere interesting.  About the most unique thing about it were the constructed scenes, utilizing actors, created by Director Sarah Polley to look like genuine old footage of her family.  They were very convincing and very creative, but made me wonder about how they violate the very ethos of documentary filmmaking because they were fictional, not truthful.

5665087,5,B00BPRI6WG,"I've been following Sarah Polley's career as long as I can remember.  Being five years younger, I was a child at the same time she was starring in roles such as Ramona or Sarah Stanley in Avonlea.  I knew some basic information about her life off-screen: that she had become an activist, the tension with Disney, her mother dying when she was a child... this film doesn't dive deep into who Sarah Polley ""is"" and that is okay!  I saw some reviews complaining about not understanding what the point of the film is, wondering what it is really about?  That question is even brought up near the end of the film, and I think it's because we've been handed a lot of information and there's a sense you get with well now what?  And I don't think that part of the story can be told yet because it is still playing out... and the ""what"" once again will look very different for all the different players.  I think if you watch this film and you have that question burdening your mind - take a minute to think through what you've seen and heard.

In away the film is about the story, but it's more than that.  She says she wants this to be a film that looks at how we tell stories.  Our perceptions of events are certainly shaped by our relation to the events, our personality, and our recollection.  A failed marriage may look completely different in one's mind 20 years later than it does in the heat of the moment for example.  What I found interesting is that she very artistically took all these different people's account for the reason she's made this film, lined them up and intertwined the stories - mixing real and recreated flashback footage, to give us a picture of how stories shape our lives, change our lives, and can sometimes define our identities.  You could look at what happened and come to the conclusion that one little joke changed her life forever.  Or maybe one day she would have found out.  Or

I read a blog article Sarah wrote after I watched this film and noticed her concern was that documentaries about one's life can come across as narcissistic and I would have to say that she achieved a very good balance of opening the door into her life but not crossing the line of telling us too much or it becoming a film that's all about her.  In fact, the stories we hear are just about everyone's but hers - unless you look at this film as being her side of the story.  She brought us into this world of chattering about ""The Story"" - keeping the intrigue by the twists and turns. Ultimately this film left me with the reality that what we say and sometimes, what we don't say, has incredible power on our lives and we rarely stop to connect the dots.

All the philosophy aside, why did I take the time to rate this film?  Easy answer: I'd recommend anyone watch this film.  It makes you think.  Aside from that, here's my checklist of a five star film:

Was it enjoyable in the moment? - Yes, I was never bored. The way she edited the film leaves you visually fed with video flashbacks and connecting individual's accounts.  The story itself was interesting and there were several turns that caused me to literally say, ""Oh My God"" out loud.

Was it thoughtfully pieced together - Yes, there was a lot of work into ""filling"" the audience's need visually through reenactments, raw video flashbacks, and intertwining the stories so that it wasn't so cut and dry.

Was it memorable? - Yes, it got stuck in my brain more than 24 hours later I was still thinking about not only the film itself and the story and how it affected real people and their lives, but I this film left me thinking about my experience watching it.  It gave room for the audience to participate in a way or feel like we're included in the story in the sense that we're the receivers of what Sarah is giving us.  Once I had the story I felt like I needed to do something with it - so I'm sharing my experience with basically any one who will listen.

Would I watch it again?  Yes, and I already have.

Bravo Sarah!  Looking forward to your next film!!",1391472000,,4036,4.384408602150538
5665088,4,B00BPRI6WG,"STORIES WE TELL opens with an extended shot of Michael Polley (director Sarah's father) reading out a prepared script in a recording studio, with his daughter facing him.  This sequence serves as a metaphor for the entire film, which concentrates in depth on the nature of story-telling.  It is fundamentally an autobiographical detective story, as Sarah interviews various members of her extended family to discover something about her late mother's life.  We learn that her mother used to be an actress and performer; a vivacious soul who married Michael (a British actor) after having experienced a disastrous first marriage.  Her marriage to Michael works fine for the first few years, but then things start to go wrong, and her mother ends up having an affair with film producer Harry Gulkin (one of Polley's interviewees).  Michael and the family are based in Toronto; Gulkin in Montreal.  As Sarah investigates more about this love-affair, she discovers something shocking about her own life that changes her perspective for ever.  As she conducts her interviews, Polley realizes that different interviewees have different versions of 'the truth,' shaped not only according to their perceptions, but also by what they want to reveal on camera.  Only by comparing different interviews can Polley reach at least an approximation about what 'really' happened to her mother and Gulkin, and the effect of their love-affair on Michael.  One reviewer of this film has already asked ""what is it REALLY about?""  The answer to this question becomes clear: there is no such thing as a 'real' or 'definitive' interpretation of the past.  We can only listen to different accounts, and make up our own minds, while realizing that our interpretation is no more or less definitive than other interpretations.  Polley's film is both uncompromising yet sympathetic to the interviewees; sometimes they are prompted into revealing truths about themselves (which perhaps they had not previously admitted), but Polley - who appears on screen as well as directing the entire film - makes no judgment on them.

It gains momentum as Sarah quizzes the different observers about her mother, Diane, a charismatic actress who seems larger than life.

As I was watching I kept waiting for the movie to get to the point. Eventually there doesn't seem to be a point. Sarah mixes documentary style interviews with film, some from home footage and some created with paid actors to appear like home footage. The reviewers keep talking about how each person has a different view, but what came through was a sequence of events in Diana's life. Sarah does a good job with pacing and revealing the two major secrets at different stages; actually, there's one secret and one story that comes as a surprise, involving Diane's first marriage.

The revelations aren't all that exciting. It's like, ""So what?"" Being Canadian, they behaved politely to one another.

The author doesn't dig deeper so we might ponder the implications of Diane's actions. Nor do we know much about Diane, beyond her outward behaviors.

5665119,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Earlier in the year I promised myself that I would explore the genre of the Documentary more this year.  I would make a conscious effort to see more documentaries and to appreciate them as a medium for storytelling and as a worthy avenue of filmmaking.  That isn't to say that I turned my nose up at them or anything, I just never really found myself compelled to watch them.  I don't read biographies.  I don't tend to watch those television documentaries (unless they are those hilarious ones on BBC about people who have ongoing relationships with sex dolls).  I have just always preferred fiction over fact.

I saw a trailer for a film called Leviathan (which Ive already reviewed) early this year that promised to be the documentary for people who don't like documentaries and so I was compelled to see it.  Admirable, but it wasn't anything wonderful (too avant-garde and underdeveloped).  Then I started to read all the glowing reviews for Sarah Polleys film Stories We Tell and since Im a fan of her work (I really liked Away from Her and Take This Waltz is easily one of the most underrated films of last year) I decided that I needed to see this movie.

Now THIS is the documentary to redefine the term documentary!

Stories We Tell manages to be two very different things at once, and balance them so well that one cant help but become enveloped in every frame.  The film is both intimate and personal while at the same time being whimsy and fantastical.  It blends fact and fiction in a way I never thought possible and basically creates a genre all its own.

This film belongs alongside films like Zelig and Sans Soleil as films dwelling within this genre (yes, Im aware that Zelig was a faux-documentary) that break down boundaries and write their own rules and ultimately become benchmarks for greatness.

Stories We Tell is a masterpiece.

What I think is no neat about this film is that it is not a director exploring a subject that they are merely interested in or vaguely connected to in an extended sense.  This is Sarah Polley making a beautiful tribute to her mother.  Taking on her parents marriage, relationship issues, her early childhood, her mothers death and then ultimately a shocking family scandal, Polleys influence, opinion and perspective could have been all over this film in an off-putting and manipulative way, but what makes this film so effective is the restraint that Polley uses in just allowing the interviewees to speak their mind, tell their stories, and inevitably grab our interest.  The subject matter, while on the surface may seem rather insignificant or unimportant, has such endearing beauty because it feels so authentic and relatable.  This is the story of family, but more than that it is a celebration of memories and how they can shape who we are and where weve been.

The same story, told by ten different people, will carry ten different meanings, all of which are equally as important depending on how you chose to look at it.

I don't want to delve into the scandal addressed in the films second half, but there is so much beauty, grace and intelligence to be noted in the way that Polley allows it to be addressed.

One thing that I will touch upon is the visual style with which Sarah uses to color in her documentary.  Throughout the film there are so many beautifully detailed sequences of home movies that help to pull in the viewer and connect them to the Polley family.  Whether it be vacations her parents took or a glimpse of Sarah playing with her father in the yard or an important meeting in a caf&eacute;, these segments help illustrate the intimate story Polley is telling us.  When it is uncovered that all of these videos are re-enactments, it becomes all the clearer how brilliant this film really is.  Sarah is a visionary director who captured life in a capsule and delivered it wish such substantial style (see what I did there).

And I just want to say that Michael Polley is EVERYTHING.  The man is endearing, charming, sweet, heartfelt, honest, passionate and his speaking voice is just captivating.  You can sense the love between Sarah and her father and his stamp of approval (and participation) in this project makes it all the more affecting.  You fall in love with him, and thus the film takes on an even deeper narrative.

His reaction to the question about what he said to his wife on her deathbed was justtoo much for me.

So, I guess its clear how I feel about this film.  It is one of the best films of the year, period.  In fact, outside of Lawrence Anyways Id have to say that this IS the best film of the year.  A solid masterpiece in style, substance and technical precision (the editing is so fluid and captivating).  This is all around perfection, from every angle.",1386288000,8,4765,4.657894736842105

I hate to disagree with all the positive reviews but Im so glad I finished this l o n g tedious,uninteresting movie/doc. Thru 8 miil  tape footage,a girl tries to find out who was her true father. That's it!! No surprises,no sub-plot,no hard feelings,nothing!! Yes the actors were good,it just has trouble gaining momentum or being riveting. Man..not only do I disagree with all the positive reviews,it was one of the most boring films I've watched this year. I actually like slow,phychological thrillers or dramas{the new horror movie ""We are what we are""}comes to mind,but at least keep my interest and make me care. Two thumbs way down!!! Only one star because I can't give it a zero minus minus!!!",1386028800,3,777,4.7555555555555555
5665121,3,B00BPRI6WG,"This movie is wonderfully produced and is very interesting.  It tells the story of director Sarah Polley's quest to figure out who is her biological father.  Sarah Polley was a Canadian child star who now, as an adult, has moved into directing.  The movie is never boring and the clips of her beautiful, now deceased mother are great.
My objection to the film is that she used actors to portray the real characters so it feels a bit of a 'rip-off' to call yourself a documentary film and then hire actors to play the real, still alive people.  That is the reason I give this only 3 stars.  If she had used the real people, or at the least, used photographs like she does of her mother, I would have felt the movie was more authentic.  That said, it IS an interesting tale and one I think people would enjoy.",1384560000,4,807,4.346666666666667

5665126,5,B00BPRI6WG,"Awesome.  Real.  Descriptive of life challenges from a male and a female point of view dating from the 1960s up to 2013.  Controversy such as mom leaving family for career at the time was unheard of, for example.  Sexism was harsher.  The Mom ""breaks the rules"" by pursuing career move after years of boring motherhood. Then, she basically screws around few guys after her divorce at her new acting gig and ends up planting her last child, conceived with her new lover, to her old hubby's nest where she had returned after years of separation from the hubby.  But she returns not because of hubby as much for the kids. The s*** is so ""outrageous"" for the 1968 she even makes it into the news for ""failing to fulfill her domestic duties"".  But The Mom was talented in screwing all the geniuses in the field of acting and writing so her daughter now, also talented naturally, made a documentary about it.  The problem was, everyone wanted to tell their version of the story.  The hubby had his version.  The lover, who was always in the shadow, had his.  The daughter finds who her biological father is around her 30s so being that she's filming it all, she wants to tell her version.  She struggles to make everyone's version heard, and runs into serious problems with both dads.  There's more to the story... But kudos to her putting it all together, I've enjoyed the reality of the movie.  I hope she makes more movies.",1384128000,,1420,4.561264822134388
5665127,4,B00BPRI6WG,"Actress Sarah Polley who also directed two excellent films (""Take This Waltz"" and ""Away From Her"") takes a shot at a documentary.  And it's personal.  It is about her family, with an emphasis on her mother Diane who died when Sarah was only 11 years old.

The doc is a bit odd to begin with as Polley shows the interview set ups and even some of the do-overs.  It is also a bit uncomfortable for many of the ""storytellers"" as she calls them.  They include her father Michael, 4 siblings, aunts, uncles and a bevy of family friends.  She sets the film up in order to record some lost history about her ""mum.""

As Polley weaves her way through various events, different perceptions and understandings of what actually happened depend on who's telling the story.  She manages to uncover some family secrets, still disputed.  Polley herself rarely gets in the way.  Most of the questions are off-camera or in the case of her father, a read narrative.  Polley, when on camera remains poised and even a bit aloof, never showing emotion that you might expect.

Polly supplements the real people with archived family movies which are interspersed with actors playing family members.  It is hard to make a distinction.  This is a highly personal film which digs deep into family mysteries and even has an additional surprise at the end.",1383609600,,1327,4.71304347826087

5665129,5,B00BPRI6WG,"You may be less familiar with actress Sarah Polley as a director, but this 34-year-old Canadian has been writing and directing films since she was 20.  Stories We Tell is a documentary about her family history.  It has an impromptu and informal style as she interviews her siblings and instructs her father in reading the narration that tells the family story, beginning with how he and her now-deceased mother met.  Eventually she turns the camera on herself and others with whom her mother was related, as she probes what she calls a basic confusion in the family.  It is an amazing film, in part because of what Polley discovers in the process of making it.  A five-year project, the result is a stunning experience of this awesome family and an awareness that your family, all our families, are also mysterious and likely hold more secrets than we might imagine.",1383523200,,866,4.785234899328859

These folks didn't seem like they were dying to put their family life out there but since they did, they did it in an honest, thoughtful and truthful way. It was humorous, sometimes sad and sometimes joyful. The family members are people you could enjoy sitting down and having a conversation with. The story itself really pulls you in (it did me anyway) and it was great throughout, no dry areas.

Micheal tells the story with such great compassion and love for Diane, showing that he'd always loved her really deeply but in his own way, yet the whole story goes around Diane not getting that much love in her life from Micheal. Because her way of showing love and being loved is way different. You can't blame any of them...and this is the interesting part.
