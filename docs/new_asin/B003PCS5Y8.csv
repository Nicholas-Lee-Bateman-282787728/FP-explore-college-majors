I did NOT like the lack of music (a little echo-y, since it's filmed inside a large museum),  and I definitely did NOT like the story of Ganesha. The idea of interweaving an Indian story in a kids yoga practice is great; however, it's NOT interpreted correctly. The story of Ganesha is completely incorrect from the Indian mythology and religious versions. I gave it 2 stars for the yoga but ZERO stars for the story. I have other yoga practices geared towards kids which is similar in poses to this dvd and only bought this to incorporate the story..what a waste!",1329696000,2,649,4.5
8401953,5,B003PCS5Y8,"I was blessed enough to receive this video as a gift and am totally thrilled with the content.  Since I started teaching kids yoga 4 years ago I am constantly reviewing and checking out what's on the market and have seen many a lousy video.  This one captures not only my child but me as well with interesting tidbits, stories of ganesha, language challenges, and takes place in a gorgeous museum which just adds to the video.  I highly recommend checking this out if you are looking for inspiration for teaching or just a video to do at home either with your kids or for them to do alone.  It is well worth it!",1326240000,,611,4.333333333333333

Beth Reese's instructional yoga DVDs provide a safe, fun way for kids to get off the couch and engage in gentle exercise, develop physical confidence, and learn about other cultures - highly recommended!""

8401955,5,B003PCS5Y8,"This is a wonderful DVD to do at home with your children. I love the story of Ganesh that is weaved into the yoga practice. There is also a section that shows a wonderful break down of each pose in english, spanish & sanskrit. Beth Reese is an wonderful instructor. The Yoginos program she has created weaves all 8 limbs of yoga into the classes. This is great for beginners and those that have a regular practice.",1277251200,2,414,4.3896103896103895
