8580115,5,B00CC0JJ3A,"Documentry of life after being in the biker gangs. Inspiring in a way, it broadens a person's view of seeing the culture and people change as time goes on.",1456876800,,155,4.379310344827586
8580116,4,B00CC0JJ3A,"I was surprised to see how short this documentary was, but it was nonetheless informative. It gave a good glimpse on who the Bosozoku were and what they are now, and is somewhat a tragic tale. Still, if you are into Bosozoku, you should get this documentary.",1437436800,,258,4.51063829787234
8580117,4,B00CC0JJ3A,"There aren't too many options out there when it comes to watching movies about Japanese biker subculture here in the US, so when there is something, gotta take it for what it's worth.

This movie concentrated more on one man's story and journey being with the ""Specter/Old Boys"" club in his youth and Yakuza ties, to his journey getting older and deciding to get his life together, eventually finding solace and purpose with the Tenrokyo religion.
Not a bad watch, short, and not the most organized, but if you are interested in hearing some ""first hand"" accounts of bosozoku, might be worth checking out.",1399075200,,605,4.8173076923076925
8580118,4,B00CC0JJ3A,"An ex-bosozoku talking about his past life with his gang (Specter) and the hardships he went through as a adolescent growing up. Very powerful and compelling story here about his daily life now and what he does for a living, a definite watch if you are interested in yakuza and biker culture.",1396742400,2,292,4.634615384615385
8580119,1,B00CC0JJ3A,"pretty sure its censored really hard, like to give the idea that the ideas around it are romanticized and that you grow up to be a miserable loner when you subscribe to this kind of subculture.",1392508800,,193,4.388888888888889
8580120,4,B00CC0JJ3A,"A very up-close film, underscored by a haunting score, and focused on the aging Bosozuku elder. The hardest part is moving on.",1391040000,2,126,4.7727272727272725
8580121,5,B00CC0JJ3A,"This film chronicles the rise and fall of biker gangs in Japan. A must-see for anyone interested in Japanese culture, especially the more obscure aspects of it!",1390953600,,160,4.962962962962963
8580122,4,B00CC0JJ3A,"Interesting film re; the subculture of motorcycle groups in Japan.
Didn't delve deeply enough (in my opinion).
Informative. Well done.",1378252800,2,134,5.75
