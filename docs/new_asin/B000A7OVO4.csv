2378506,5,B000A7OVO4,This a great collection of drills and instruction by the master ball handler himself.  Highly recommend!  These are the basics that any young player needs.,1236470400,7,155,5.16
2378507,5,B000A7OVO4,Received perfectly,1437091200,,18,8.5
2378508,5,B000A7OVO4,"I purchased these for my teenage son.  He is in 6th grade and extremely interested in basketball, hoping to go out for the team at school next year.  My husband and I are older parents.  My husband can shoot with him, but has never coached basketball or played more than occasionally.  I bought these so our son could work in our drive way.  I have seen a marked difference in him abilities to successful shoot from a variety of places in ;our drive way and yard.  He sits and watches the DVDs, even taking notes.  I wish this guy did composition/writing instructions  '-)
Then he goes out, practices the suggested moves for 15 minutes and comes in for more info.and doesn't have a coach.
We intend to send him to a camp this summer, but this will make sure he can go and not feel like he is a 'total newby'.  I would suggest these to anyone that wants to learn",1432166400,4,861,4.298136645962733

2378510,5,B000A7OVO4,I've used this before in rebuilding a high school basketball program.  I bought this for one of my granddaughters who is playing on a travel team.,1424908800,,146,4.615384615384615
2378511,5,B000A7OVO4,"Although the video was produced a long time ago, it's still one of the best videos for learning the basic fundamentals of ball handling, dribbling, passing and shooting.  Coaches, parents and kids can learn a lot.  Anyone watching the video will be motivated to go out and try the drills . . . Pistol Pete just has that way that makes you want to try the drills.  I've been coaching basketball for over 30 years and have over $1,000 invested in books and videos.  This is definitely one of the best for youth basketball.",1416355200,4,520,4.5
2378512,5,B000A7OVO4,A timeless classic for any aspiring youth who wants to work on his/her game at home.,1410739200,,84,4.3125
2378513,5,B000A7OVO4,"I ordered one set DVDs for my son, who has been in a travel team for 2 years. So, he has outgrown most of the stuff at the DVDs.

However, this does not reduce the value of DVDs. The skills and practices are excellent for beginners,  or kids who haven't got formal trainings.

I also want to thank Hoopheaven for the excellent customer service. Quick response and very helpful.

I would still highly recommend it.",1407888000,,413,4.466666666666667

2378516,5,B000A7OVO4,"Excellent series of DVDs for beginner, intermediate and high school level basketball players! Many of the exercises Pistol Pete shows us are very important fundamentals that most recreational league and some travel league coaches don't know and/or don't teach!!",1394668800,2,261,5.717948717948718
2378517,5,B000A7OVO4,"We bought these  DVD's, when they were for VHS for our son. ""The Pistol"" was one of our son's most admired basketball player. He wanted to be like ""Pistol Pete"" in basketball, and he pretty much was. He was short in stature, but fast like a jack rabbit on the court. He was our junior high and high school's best scoring point guard, and still holds that record. He graduated from high school in 2001. He played in college as well, and today besides being an excellent, middle school teacher, he helps coach basketball and soccer too.",1392508800,2,534,4.505154639175258
2378518,4,B000A7OVO4,"These instructional DVD's were made a few years back, but still provide solid instruction and drills for both experienced and inexperienced players.  My son has worked with professional basketball trainers and was familiar with some of the drills already, but there are also drills that are new to him.  Pistol Pete explains things very clearly, and it is easy to follow along with what he is demonstrating.",1390521600,,407,5.059701492537314
2378519,5,B000A7OVO4,Pistol puts on a show in each segment that illustrates what can be accomplished with hard work and perseverance. He was the all time master of each of these four areas of basketball.,1377820800,,182,4.545454545454546
2378520,5,B000A7OVO4,"Even though the videos are somewhat dated, the techniques never go out of style.  Bought this for my 5th grader and Pete's sense of humor even entertains her.  She watches the videos and then practices his techniques.  Awesome videos!  Worth the money.",1367280000,,252,4.928571428571429
2378521,5,B000A7OVO4,"Amazing is the only way to describe what Pete could do with a basketball!  But many of those skills came through hours of skills and drills set up by his dad, Press.  Pete shows what is possible with hard work and determination.

Though I believe Pete targeted younger players, I think the drills are a good tool for beginners and advanced players just wanting to perfect their game.  Fundamentals are the key to long term success and this skills will help anyone that wants to improve their game.  We're big on fundamentals and I constantly tell my boys to work on the basics.  Athleticism wins games early, but skill overcomes (most of the time) athleticism long term!",1333324800,,670,4.683760683760684

Great training for all levels!",1323734400,2,300,4.788461538461538
2378524,5,B000A7OVO4,"We bought these videos in hopes to improve the skills of a first time youth league.  The results were incredible!!  From one week to the next after viewing the videos with the boys, the team looked like a whole new league!!  The easy to follow techniques improved the skills of the whole team.  The parents were baffled and thought they were watching a seasoned league!  The coaches were impressed and mentioned their secret weapon at the closing ceremony!  These videos are worth every dime, and would be beneficial to all ages!  For anyone that is serious about the game, coaches that want the upper hand, or players that just want to have fun and learn more about the game, this is your secret weapon!!!  Don't miss out!!  Thanks to ""COACHES SOURCE"" for your incredible service and recommendation!!!",1299283200,2,802,4.795620437956204
