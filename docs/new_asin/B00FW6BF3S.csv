8618846,5,B00FW6BF3S,"Bernard Rose is, in my opinion, the best British film director working today.
Despite ""Immortal Beloved"".

This is a long review but don't you worry because I won't tell the whole film to you.
I detest the inconsiderate practice of telling the whole story of a film, that plagues many of Amazon's reviews.
Please note that you will need a dvd or blu ray player that can play an European DVD.

I watched ""Ivan Xtc"" three times. I watched ""The Kreutzer Sonata"" just once but will watch
it again soon. Those are the first two films
by Bernard Rose that are adaptations of Tolstoi's stories.

""Boxing Day"" is the third film. The dvd doesn't have subtitles and the only extra feature is
the film with commentaries of the director and the two main actors, Danny Huston and Matthew Jacobs.

Jacobs is excellent but Danny Huston is something else. I find it difficult to explain but it is as if
his acting in this film brought magnificence to ordinary daily life.

The story is poetic and full of humanity, intense and quiet like a snowstorm.

It is based on the short story "" Master and Man"", which is available at Amazon on paperback and also free kindle, with translation of Louise Maude and Aylmer Maude.

The original Tolstoi's story, passed in the 1870s, is about a man and one of his servants travelling just after Christmas to close a business deal. The film goes in the same direction and, thinking about it, ""Boxing Day"" is the most moving and raw Christmas story that I've ever watched.

Bernard Rose is a Renaissance man. He directed, shot and edited the film. He also wrote the script and co authored the original music. I wonder if he also cooked for the crew!

I would say that the camerawork is his only weak point but, then again, the fact that he operates the camera himself gives a more intimate feeling to the film.

The dvd ""The Kreutzer Sonata"" has an interview with Danny Huston where he says how more comfortable he felt on the set because Bernard Rose shot the film himself, using a small ""tourist camera"". The filming flowed in a more intimate way because there were fewer technicians involved.

The same is valid for ""The Boxing Day, where the director probably used the same small camera.

The one critic I have is that the camerawork, by being less intrusive to the actors, became more visible to the public. That is,
images going out of focus and abrupt movements of the camera. Fortunately, it was not very frequent.

I read somewhere about this old man who used to bathe in the river near his house in the 19th century or before. The river always froze during the winter but that never stopped the old man. He simply opened holes in the river with his axe so he could have his bath.

I loved ""Ivan Xtc"", ""Kreuzer Sonata"" and "" Boxing Days"". It is really good to know that Bernard Rose is out there, making films that break the frozen river in us.",1387065600,,2870,4.515444015444015
