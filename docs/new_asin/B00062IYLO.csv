8037294,4,B00062IYLO,Yes this show can be a little cheesy it was aimed at kids but I found it a fun romp and a great way to feed my inner child.,1411257600,,123,3.2758620689655173
8037295,5,B00062IYLO,I had the first volume and finished it in a day then had to have the second volume. It's wonderfully campy and humorous. It brought back my Saturday mornings as a kid trying to catch this show on Sci-fi. You cannot go wrong with this show. Geordie Johnson makes an excellent Dracula.,1330560000,,283,4.461538461538462
8037296,5,B00062IYLO,"The second volume has 10 episodes just as good as the first.  Many of the guest stars would pop up later on in the 90's as main characters in their own movies and TV shows.  Geordie Johnson does a great job as Dracula, bringing out both his humor and powerful intelligence.
Sad to say, the series came to an end, right when it seems to be developing a future.  Episode Klaus Encounter of the Interred Kind, with its interesting development and focus on Dracula's hidden powers suggest that the show had more promise and if left to continue...
Oh well, what is NOT to be is NOT to be.
Enjoy!",1314316800,,590,4.345454545454546
8037297,3,B00062IYLO,"Warning: this is part 2 of a two part DVD set.  If you want the whole set you have to buy both volume 1 and volume 2 or the two disc version of the DVD set.  Other than that there is a little problem of episode order.

  I was watching the Dracula the series DVD set and I realized there is a pretty big mistake and this mistake dates back to the series' original air dates.

  The final episode of the series is Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.  This ends with the semi-cliff hanger of Gustav Helsing following Lucard (Dracula) and Klaus through a portal in Dracula's castle.  And the boys Christopher and Max preparing to return to America with all of Gustav's notes.  Yet someone made the mistake of airing the episode My Dinner with Lucard after Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.

  My Dinner with Lucard is a clips episode of all the previous episodes (leading up to Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind) and turned out to be a dream of Gustav Helsing.  This is clearly set BEFORE he followed Lucard through the portal.  I do not know why it was aired in the wrong order or why the DVD set maintains this misorder.

Otherwise it's a great DVD set of a fun TV series in the vein (if you pardon the pun) of shows like Goosebumps.  The show focuses on the adventures of sixteen-year-old Christopher Townsend and his ten-year-old brother Max Townsend.  They take up residence with their Uncle Gustav Helsing who lives with a local student, Sophie.  Chris and Max soon learn that their uncle is actually a vampire hunter from a long line of vampire hunters and their biggest thread is Alexander Lucard, a highly successful and corrupt corporate mogul (sort of like David Xanatos of Gargoyles) who turns out to be Dracula himself.  It's a fun show but jut be wary of the mistake in the episode order.",1290556800,2,1811,4.493865030674846
8037298,5,B00062IYLO,"I wish there was more of this to watch.  Gordy Johnson, handsome and wise.  I wish that there were more Dracula movies like this one!",1232668800,,133,4.28
8037299,5,B00062IYLO,"I've been a fan of this series for years, but never expected to see it released on video. Its witty dialog and campy presentation makes it quite a change from the serious, horrific treatment Dracula usually gets.  Blond Canadian actor Geordie Johnson does an excellent job presenting our favorite bloodsucker as a modern business man.  Bernard Behrens plays his enemy, Gustave Helsing, who is aided by three children (played by Mia Kirshner, Jacob Tierney and Joe Roncetti) in the quest to destroy Dracula. Forever Knight's Geraint Wyn Davies appears in several episodes and Dracula's student and sometimes rival. Serious Dracula/vampire fans will probably want to pass on it, but those willing to accept a broader view, it's a very enjoyable series!",1103241600,10,750,5.190082644628099
