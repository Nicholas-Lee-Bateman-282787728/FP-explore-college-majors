8480657,4,B005NN4PR8,"An alcoholic, liberal radio personality takes a job in New Orleans at the conservative radio station WUSA, gets involved in a conspiracy, and, in the meantime, hooks up with a down-and-out barmaid. Both are seeking things that don't exist for them. The film takes place at the end of the 60s and addresses the social issues relevant at the time. Woodward and Newman are an incredible acting teamas were Tracy and Hepburn and Bogie and Bacallbut they're also outstanding dramatic actors in their own right. This movie is dated, slow-moving and confusing at times, but enjoy this character study for the strong acting from all involvedbut particularly Woodward and Newman.",1519776000,,670,5.1
