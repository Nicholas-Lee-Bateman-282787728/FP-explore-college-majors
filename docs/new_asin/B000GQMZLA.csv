8133891,5,B000GQMZLA,"This movie is NOT the true story of how Salome, AZ, got its name. It's also not really a musical. But it is a thrill ride of weirdly inappropriate behaviour and unusual settings. Don't miss it. You'll laugh yourself silly. From Appomattox to Bismarck's Europe, from the desert to the Pacific Gold Coast, these adventurers leave no cliche un-messed-with. 'The Blue Danube' and 'O Tannenbaum' take a drubbing, too. A trip back in time to the days when terrible film-making and delightful entertainment were not mutually exclusive concepts. All that, and Yvonne de Carlo. The hat feather scene is a cinema classic!",1484697600,,611,5.0

8133893,5,B000GQMZLA,"Revisiting this movie after decades, I was surprised at the complexity of the plot  and the historical content which blew by me as a child!  Recently returned to Salome for old time's sake.  Nice people,  Very quiet.",1418601600,,216,4.756756756756757
