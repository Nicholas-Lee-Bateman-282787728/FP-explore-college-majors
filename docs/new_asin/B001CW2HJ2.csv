3520313,5,B001CW2HJ2,Absolutely essential footage of some of the greatest work from these legends. Can't go wrong with this lineup and thank God the cameras were rolling!,1287360000,,149,5.0
3520314,5,B001CW2HJ2,"For a film that has to rely on materiels from the '60s for both visual and audio source, this is simply put: Perfect!  Oscar and his group are, of course, flawless... and the performances are simply moving.  It is as if you are right there with them, in the audience.  Bravo!  Of course, Ray Brown on bass lives up to the name later given to him by Lorindo Almieda: ""The Reason.""  Yes, he is indeed ""the reason"" there is a string bass.  He is my all time favorite bassist of them all.  (I am a professional bassist, myself, of over 45 years experience.)

3520315,5,B001CW2HJ2,"The Oscar Peterson Trio in the sixties with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen was not only Oscar's best trio ever, it was also THE BEST JAZZ TRIO EVER.
There was complete integration, there was total devotion and a closeness that is unsurpassed in jazz. This dvd captures that trio in three concerts.
The earliest in 1963 recorded in a television studio before a live audience in Sweden was fine, but mostly routine, although ""Chicago"" is great.
The last, taken in a concerthall in Helsinki in 1965, featured mainly trumpeter, vocalist Clark Terry, who did not only great works with flugelhorn and trumpet, but also turned the hall upside down with his, now classic ""Mumbles"".
The SUPERCONCERT is however that at the Holbaek Jazz Club in 1964 in Denmark.
Oscar, Ray and Ed are very inspired and do long tracks, starting of with ""Soon"", a hard swinging ""On Green Dolphin Street"",and one of the greatests versions of ""Bag's Groove"" ever.
These two are followed by a little too short, but fine ""Tonight"".
But the SUPERTRACK is certainly: ""C-Jam Blues""!
If you can sit still while listening to this irrestible swing: go see a doctor at once!
For over 9 minutes Oscar is a powerhouse of invention, only his long introduction is a gass, Ray does one of the best basssolo's in jazz ever, Ed is razor-sharp, so when Oscar takes charge the mood is set.
This is the best reading of ""C-Jam Blues"" you will ever hear!
This is Oscar at his greatest, unsurpassed, driving, changing gear, and swinging virtuoso level you can only dream of and this shape is only found in that great ""London House Sessions"". (5 cd box)
""C-JAM BLUES"" alone is worth buying the entire dvd, it will take you completely, and there will be no more questions asked about what was the best trio in jazz.
Because you will know: forever.
Next track is the beautiful ""Hymn to Freedom"" , but it is sadly ruined at the end by some stupid guy who runs into the mikes of Ray and Ed.
This concert was broadcasted on Danish television under the title: ""Swing It Oscar"" , well he certainly did that.
5 stars for the dvd and 500 for C-JAM BLUES !
Will somebody in Denmark step forward and please give us the entire Holbaek concert, please.

3520316,5,B001CW2HJ2,"This DVD easily lives up to expectations, capturing the warmth, energy, and excitement of Peterson's second great trio--at its best--in a series of 3 European concerts.  The disk is a generous 84 minutes in length, and includes 16 different songs.  The camera work and sound quality are both very good.

Ray Brown (bass) and Ed Thigpen (drums) were surely meant to play with Oscar Peterson.  These 3 guys were so tight!  Although you can feel it when you listen to their recordings, being able to watch their interactions and see the energy is a joy.

Guest Roy Eldridge plays a nice muted solo in the first set, and Clark Terry leads 3 fine numbers in the third set--and even sings his well-known, very funny, ""Mumbles"" to close the set. The participation of these 2 great horn players adds nice variety to the collection, although my favorite tracks are those featuring just the Trio.

Everything is very good on this DVD (except for one brief sound distortion) and the high points seem too numerous to mention.  If you're an Oscar Peterson fan, you probably won't be disappointed. If you're not yet a fan of this late, very great artist,  chances are you will be after watching this.",1223078400,12,1186,4.718446601941747
3520317,5,B001CW2HJ2,"Jazz Icons have done it again. They have released a stellar DVD compliation of Oscar Peterson concerts. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant music. There are three concerts: Sweden: 1963, which features Oscar's best working trio of Ed Thigpen and Ray Brown. This concert also features a guest appearence by trumpeter Roy Eldridge who's a legend. The next footage is Denmark: 1964 and features just the trio. Last, is Finland:1965, which features trumpeter Clark Terry, who, if you're a jazz fan, needs no introduction.

I found all of these concerts to be very enjoyable. My favorite is Finland: 1965 for the simple fact that Terry only reassures the fact that he's one of the best trumpet players that ever lived. His improvisations on ""Misty"" and ""Mack The Knife"" are just outstanding.

Oscar Peterson proves once again that he's one of the most gifted pianists of the past 50 years. Everything he touched it turned to gold. His classic trio of Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen are also at the top of their game proving that their one of the best rhythm sections of all-time.

I can't wait to see what Jazz Icons has up their sleeves in this next batch of concerts. Anyone a fan of Oscar Peterson or Clark Terry should really pick up this DVD.",1222992000,12,1232,4.747663551401869

The production quality is great too as you get up close and personal with these fine musicians. This 'ol black and white tape came out with high quality audio and video so don't worry about this being a second rate experience.
 This is a keeper for any Jazz fan.",1410393600,,347,4.688524590163935
3520320,5,B001CW2HJ2,"This DVD is an absolute treasure.  I am so grateful to European sources who recorded the concerts so that they are still available today.  I am a classically trained pianist who is only in later life starting to pay attention to jazz, and this is a fabulous piano lesson and a divine listening and viewing experience.  Oscar Peterson is right up there with the all time musical giants in any time era.",1404518400,2,401,4.541666666666667
3520321,5,B001CW2HJ2,"Fortunately Oscar Peterson's playing has been well documented on both album and video. If I had to chose a single video this would be the one. For one reason the sound quality is superb, especially considering that the performances are from TV broadcasts from the early to mid 1960s. On a more subjective note, this video contains my favorite incarnation of Peterson's trio with Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums.

I could gush superlatives, but they will really tell you nothing about the videos. You can often find parts (and sometimes the entire DVD) by doing a search on the web. If that fails, the reason I am so thrilled with this video is the close up shots of Peterson's hands, and some excellent footage of Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. Thigpen in particular makes this DVD worthwhile for me because he has long been an inspiration and I exploit every opportunity to study not only his sound, but his actual movements. His brushwork is exceptional, but his stick playing is every bit as exquisite. More importantly, Ray Brown's tone and his ability to switch to melody is something every musician should closely study and every fan should sit back and enjoy. Brown is among a handful of bassists who rose to the pinnacle of their art.

The concerts are in chronological order, which is not always the case with some of the Jazz Icons DVDs. The first concert is from Stockholm, Sweden on April 3, 1963. A plus for me is when Roy Eldridge joins in on trumpet. I have admired his playing ever since I first heard him backing Anita O'Day; he adds a lot to the sound and ambience on this particular segment. The songs in this set are:
Reunion Blues
Satin Doll
But Not For Me
It Ain't Necessarily So
Chicago

On the next segment, performed in Holbaek, Denmark on May 2, 1964, the trio has no guest performers. It's Peterson, Brown and Thigpen and they shine. The songs in this set are:
Soon
On Green Dolphin Street
Bags' Groove
Tonight
C-Jam Blues
Hymn To Freedom

For the final segment, performed in Helsinki, Finland on March 23, 1965, the trio is joined by Clark Terry on trumpet and flugelhorn. A personal highlight from this segment is Mack the Knife. In fact I was a bit jarred because it sounded a lot like a rendition that Louis Armstrong performed in London. Watching Terry switching between trumpet and flugelhorn as a call and response is priceless. However, the horn was icing and the cake was the trio itself. Songs in this set are:
Yours Is My Heart Alone
Mack The Knife (a.k.a. Moritat)
Blues For Smedley
Misty
Mumbles",1387411200,,2557,4.588621444201313

8290117,4,B001CW2HJ2,"Deducting a star for the bad editing choices, especially in the middle set.

Sometimes I think I should teach a course, but really, there's no course.  It's just 2 sentences:  Move the shots around a little, but not too much.  When someone's soloing, show most of his solo clearly.

That's all there is to it, it's so simple.  This set has too many facial closeups and too little on Oscar's magical hands, especially when he's really ripping it.  Such a shame too, because the playing is so exemplary.  Not just Oscar, the whole trio is a well-oiled machine, such a pleasure to listen to.

About 2/3 of the way thru Oscar's massive solo on C-Jam Blues, he is about as close as you'll ever see to a human being flying.  That tune and Hymn to Freedom are incredible highlights.

If you want to see well-edited videos, check out Hiromi's -- or the Monk video in this Icons series.",1461628800,,877,4.487341772151899
8290118,5,B001CW2HJ2,"Low keyed production (which is fine) and of course, amazing, tight trio playing. The consistent combination of speed and beautiful, innovative, sensitive note choices can only be Oscar Peterson. To see his playing while hearing it just leads you to shake your head in wonderment. . .how does he come up with so many different ways of interpreting the same harmonic progressions, time after time? I've watched it quite a few times and it never gets old. How does a person get this good? It has to be innate genius and constant practice.",1454716800,,535,4.763440860215054

8290120,4,B001CW2HJ2,"These live concerts by Oscar's trio brought back memories of many nights I attended Oscar's performances at jazz clubs in New York City in the early to mid-60s. Always a big fan of his, I found this DVD had excellent sound qualities and competent camera work showing  the outstanding talents of Oscar, Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen when they were a trio unmatched in jazz. My only complaint is that I was unable to enjoy the five cuts in Finland due to a malfunction in the manufacturing process of the DVD. Despite many attempts to clear up the problem the distortion in picture and sound was not able to be rectified. This in no way detracts from the incredible work in the Sweden and Denmark concerts, but I am disheartened that I will never hear the Finland concert due to problems in making the disc, unless I purchase another DVD.",1427587200,,831,4.54
