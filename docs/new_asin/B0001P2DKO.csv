8015980,5,B0001P2DKO,"This is a delightful comedy made for Russian television in the 80s but set in Moscow in the 50s.  Kostik is a young college student who comes to Moscow to study history and stays with his aunt, who manages a communal apartment (these were common in the Soviet Union - several families had separate rooms but shared certain facilities).  He soon finds his life intertwined with those of the other residents.

Among them are Lev Khobotov, his controlling ex-wife Margarita (who thwarts all his attempts at finding love and happiness) and her new beau, Savva. Arkady Velyurov is a musical comedian who is past his prime.  The film is mostly about the search for fulfillment by Khobotov, Velyurov, and Kostik himself.
