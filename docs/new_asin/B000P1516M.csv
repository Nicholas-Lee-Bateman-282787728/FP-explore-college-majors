8188138,3,B000P1516M,"MT57...........is obviously not a high level basketball player nor knowledgeable in the game. I play semi pro level and i've played all types of different talent and ill say in regards to MT57's racial comment on Pete's success that it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that most of teams he played were white in college and thats why he only averaged 24 ppg in the NBA because it was more racially balance. Partna your just like all the commentators that try to predict winners etc your stupidly wrong! First lets say this. Petes rediculous average in college was due to the fact that it was college level players not a team make up of the best college players but college teams that recruited the best they could in which case they obviously would have some average to mediocre players mixed with star talent like the pistol. secondly his high scoring average in college varied because he was way ahead of his time so by the time he got to his junior and senior years it was just way to easy for him unlike no a days they didn't allow you to leave early so he had to stay and kill! In reference to racial success if you are a true pistol fan youd remember his 8th grade season when he played for the highschool varsity and played a non sanctioned ALL BLACK TEAM.............MT57 (MORON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and he had 31pts that game in 8th GRADE!!!!!! Last id like to say in response to your non basketball playing wanna be hater that the head coach of LSU that came to replace the pistols father as head coach Dale Brown who did an analysis based on his shooting percentage and shot chart selection that was based on the areas where his shots were made which all coaches have access to and you may have seen on commentating in NBA games there shot charts blue is makes and red is misses anyways Dale Brown did all this research on shot selection missed and made and from what distance and calculated if there had been 3pt lines in college while pistol was at LSU he would of actually averaged 57 ppg instead of 44 which is a difference of 13ppg so if you take his 24 ppg NBA average and add 13pts for the 3 line he would have averaged 37 ppg. YES even against ""the racially mixed NBA"" give it a rest dude your an idiot the all time ppg avg is Michael Jordan at 30.12 ppg and hes had a 3pt line his entire career which puts him 7 points less than the pistol if they had threes back then. black people are not better or more gifted than white people there just more passionate then white people about sports and by that i mean the majority not literally ""all"" so give that bull about pistol having trouble with the racially mixed NBA is why his avg dropped all it was is the 3 line wasn't inducted until his last season in 1980 when he played with the rookie Larry Bird for the celtics. man i hate idiots like you that come on here with your uneducated athletic opinions your just like bill walton or john madden or lee corso fun to watch but your view of the game is as dumb as your brain power!!!!!!!!!! as for this video im not much for the no sound and black and white video but if your a pete fan then get it its your call its only $24. peace",1190419200,,3153,4.283082077051926
8188139,3,B000P1516M,"This appears to be a one hour television special with an interview of Mark Kriegel, who wrote a biography of Pete Maravich.  Interspersed throughout the interview is B&W footage of his LSU games, including a few shots of his freshman year that I haven't seen anywhere else.  The ""bonus"" feature is the second half of the Kentucky at LSU game of his senior year.  It is disappointing in that the camera shots are long-range and there is no sound.  Without commentary, it's sometimes hard to tell Pete from his teammates.  Since the game was televised by CBS, I wish they had included that telecast with commentary.  Maybe somebody will someday.  If you're looking for your first ""Pistol"" DVD, I recommend ""The Night of Pistol Pete"" which covers his best game as a pro.",1180310400,7,767,4.7218045112781954
8188140,2,B000P1516M,"The first part of this DVD consists of an interview by the producer of the author of the recent book, Pistol.  It is shot on a very low budget and, while the author has interesting points to make, the book probably has better production values than this DVD. Interspersed with that interview are a couple of conversations between some players who played with or against Pistol at LSU and they are unilluminating to be kind.

There is some b&w footage of Pistol and it makes for a good historical document but also of very low quality. Most of it is shot from a single point and with no sound.

Finally, this dvd does not cover his pro career except for brief discussion of the first year.

Having nothing to do with the DVD, I'm going to use this space to summarize my one and only chance to see Pistol play in his prime for posterity.  In November 1970, his rookie year, Pistol came to Philadelphia (Spectrum) for the first time. It was one of his first games in the league. Back then, hardly anyone went to NBA games and my mom got 4 seats just a couple of rows off the floor for me to see my hero live.  The powers that be set up the player intros so that the Hawks ran out of their tunnel one at a time - they were the visitors, mind you - mainly to milk the excitement over Pistol being in town for the first time.  He was the last one to be intro'd, of course, and when he came jogging out, there were about a half dozen young women who leapt out of the stands and jumped all over him such that he had to slow down and run an obstacle course to get to his teammates. That was the phenomenon of Pistol Pete, and, at the end of this DVD, the author touches on the jealousy and racial tension that it triggered among older NBA players. You also learn from this DVD, and I am sure the book, that one reason for Pete's astonishing success in college was that many of the teams he played against were all or heavily white, and you can understand why he was not able to match that in the more racially balanced NBA of the 1970's, although he did ultimately wind up with a 24+ per game scoring average on 44% shooting (plus 4 boards and 5 assists per game) in an era without a 3-pt line (which only came in his last NBA year).

Anyway, it's wonderful that someone took the trouble to put this out but it isn't very good. Hopefully there will be a better video product on Pete someday.",1179964800,2,2382,4.185589519650655
8188141,2,B000P1516M,"While this DVD does have some B&W footage of Pistol Pete, it is limited.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised

when it clocks in at 65 min.  A good deal of the disc is the author talking to another guy about Pete.  The footage

they have obtained isn't the most flattering, though on occasion you do see glimpses of his star power.  I hope

one day we can really have a decent video of the Pistol.",1178064000,7,401,4.12987012987013
