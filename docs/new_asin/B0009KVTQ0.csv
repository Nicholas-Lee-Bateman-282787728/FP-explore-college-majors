8140423,4,B0009KVTQ0,"This one caught my eye on the previously viewed rack. I thought I would give it a look since it was sporting an award for best Canadian feature. This movie turned out to be a true diamond in the rough. It is quite realistic in terms of representation of a troubled relationship and how this affects a real live person. The young woman in the story, Lola, is caught in her troubled relationship and is confronted by the feelings, memories and choices that we all make in our lives. The film makers did a fantastic job of bringing those aspects to life in the film. Lola is faced with constant belittling from her husband and she seems caught in a dependant role despite her attempts to be independant. She is given the opportunity to escape from this situation when she meets a new and very independant companion who is subsequently killed. Lola is in a state of turmoil and flux as she struggles with her decisions and transforms into her new ""self""

The plot was a bit off the wall - being more of an emotional roller coaster  - riding in the shoes of the characters themselves and seeing what fuels their choices. I found this to be what made the movie fresh and enjoyable. Ah what tangled webs we weave...

I would certainly recommend this movie.",1154649600,5,1249,4.493392070484582
