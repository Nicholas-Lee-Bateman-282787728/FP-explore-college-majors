2486407,3,B000E3LCUK,"I can't say enough about Redd's stand up.  It is very funny and filthy.  His speech on censorship is quite amusing, and others are downright hysterical.

Redd Foxx is terrific.  Unfortunately, the video transfer on this DVD isn't.  It looks like someone used home equipment to dump it on to DVD from an old VHS copy.  There are lines across the screen, flashes to black and white, etc.  If a decent remaster of this video ever comes out I'll easily give this five stars.  But till then, I recommend buying one of Redd Foxx's CDs to hear his comedy.",1176681600,16,548,4.4646464646464645
2486408,4,B000E3LCUK,"Even though he passed away years ago, Redd Foxx is still lively and ferocious with the one-liners and deadpan humor.  This is the Foxx who entertained audiences on Vaudville stages, and the same man who did great comedy albums.  Don't expect Fred Sanford up on that stage.",1173484800,,272,4.76595744680851
2486409,4,B000E3LCUK,"THe DVD did not get a 5 because of the DD not Redd's performance.  The DVD did not have many of the standard features we have been accostumed to; specially the bonus videos and even closed caption.

Redd Foxx shows how loveable and crazy he is on this stand up (A la Fred Sanford).

He even makes the crowd sing 'Row Row Your Boat'!!

If you've always asked yourself where did Fred G. Sanford came from, you must see this stand up!!",1156723200,7,432,4.2317073170731705

2486435,5,B000E3LCUK,"This is one funny stand up performance by Redd Foxx and very indicative of his act. He is one of my top 3 comedians of all time, along with Richard Pryor and Rodney Dangerfield.  They don't make 'em like Redd anymore. I wish he was still here to make us laugh, as the world was a much better and funnier place, with him in it.",1432512000,,326,4.015384615384615

2486438,5,B000E3LCUK,Redd Foxx was a comic genius whom I wish could have lasted longer.  He is raunchy and edgy but a real talent in every sense of the word.  I enjoyed the comedy of this man when he was on Sanford and Son and his stand up is timeless!!!,1381363200,2,233,3.8333333333333335

While I don't think his stand up is as funny as his acting, I still appreciate who he was as a comedian and how far he came.  Its also another comedian whom my parents and relatives played when they thought we were in bed sleeping.  he he!",1265155200,4,311,3.967741935483871
2486467,5,B000E3LCUK,"I bought this dvd about a year or two ago. I couldn't stop laughing. My family couldn't stop laughing when they saw it. It was a classic. Redd Foxx to me was one of the true Kings of Comedy that opened the door for alot of black comics, including the GOAT Mr. Richard Pryor. I miss them both, but this dvd is worth the money. Wish it had more features.",1217635200,,352,4.042857142857143

2486470,4,B000E3LCUK,"I have loved watching Redd Foxx as the lovable character ""Fred G. Sanford"" for years. ""G"" stands for GREAT as far as I'm concern. This was the first time I saw his live act ever! I was so engaged with

  his commentary about life, sex, politics and racial differences. And seeing him RAW and live was...I was just stuck to the screen. I never realized how much of a chain smoker he was. But he was charming, witty and clever. Very entertaing stand-up. He was in Las Vegas when he did his bit and you almost got the feeling that the people were not ready for him. As if they were expecting him to be Fred sanford or something. But what impressed me the most about Redd Foxx was that he never let anything or anyone stop him from being him. He cursed and was vulgar as he could be but in his own loveable charming way that made him irresistable to watch.

I'll just write, if you love anything about Redd Foxx and interested in knowing and seeing another side of him than get this DVD.",1180051200,3,983,4.240641711229946

8105222,5,B000E3LCUK,Funny and takes me to the time in the late 1990s and early 2000s listening to his comedy records and his live and dirty CD. Still he makes me laugh even today. Thanks for selling this.,1491436800,,184,4.138888888888889
