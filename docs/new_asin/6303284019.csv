622572,5,6303284019,"I've tried several workout tapes targeting abs, and while they have all been decent, this is without a doubt the most useful I've ever had.  The workout is intense and uses a technique called 'muscle confusion' to get  the most out of the exercises.  When I first started, I couldn't even get  through one seven-minute workout.  Within two months, I could do the entire  tape in one sitting.  I'm starting to look more like the guy on the cover  (he just introduces the segments -- don't get your hopes up, ladies).

622573,4,6303284019,"This is a great ab video if you like variety in a workout.  There is 5 ""daily"" segments of 6 to 9 minutes each.  If you are having a strong workout day you could even do more than one.  The guy that host the  videos is a little dorky but he looks good.  The workouts themselves must  have been done in the 80's judging by the leotards and other corny outfits  but it is a good workout if you can get past the scenery.",950572800,10,417,3.892857142857143

622664,2,6303284019,"I bought this after having my third baby.  I did it so often I had the video memorized, but still did not see results.  The instructors move quickly through the movements without informing you of propper posture, so its easy to hurt your back. The video is misleading because the hot guy on the cover, the ""guest trainer"", talks for about 30 seconds, then you watch a room full of women exercising.  The guy comes back at the end and says, ""That was tough, see you tomorrow."" And that's it.  I finally got rid of the video because in the workout room there are some ""artsy"" paintings of topless women on the walls.  The pictures are not real graphic, but I didn't like my older boys seeing them.

622687,4,6303284019,"After reading other reviews I decided to try The Firm 5-day abs. I have been using the DVD (part of a DVD set) for 18 days now. Although I didn't SEE results by day 10 I could feel results. By day 15 I started to see results. And for less than 10 minutes each day that is great!

I have no idea why Tracy Jame in this. Basically he tells you before each work out to lay down and then they cut to a female instructor who I think does a great job and is very encouraging with out being annoying.

Yes, this dvd/vhs is from the 80's and the Casio back ground music and work out attire are very 80's. But the music does a great job of changing pace with the exercise being done, and I'm in my living room in my sweats so I'm not terribly concerned about what the people on the TV are wearing.

I would buy this DVD again in a heart beat and with the results I've gotten so far I'll be trying out the other dics in the set soon!",1316563200,,923,3.898936170212766

622692,5,6303284019,"I LOVE this five-day abs tape by THE FIRM.  I've been using it for more than 10 years.  I like that there are five different workouts.  None of them are more than 9 minutes.  So when I'm rushing around getting ready for work in the morning, I know I have time to do my ab workout if I still have 6 to 9 minutes left before I need to leave the house.  It helps me rush to be ready on time because I don't want to miss the workout.  The music to the videos is a bit cheesy/dated-sounding, but the ab exercises are well choreographed to the music.  So the music, cheesy as it may be, makes a lot of sense and helps you get through the workout!  Also, I can do abs on my own, of course, but when I do, I end up resting and daydreaming a lot in between and before I know it I may end up taking 20 minutes to do the workout.  With the FIVE-DAY ABS tape, I just press play, lie down on the floor, GET THE AB WORK DONE, and then I'm up and outta there .... on my way to work.  No time to dawdle!  It is perfect for me.

Also, I like that there is a different workout each day, so I don't get bored doing the same thing every day.  It's just enough variety, and very effective, which is why I keep at it.

Several years ago, I got a tiny little voice recorder and used it to save the audio for all five sessions. It makes it easy for me to keep doing my abs while I'm traveling.  Recently my VHS tape that I use at home has disappeared. I don't know how!  It must have fallen down behind somewhere, but I can't find it!  I went searching for it online ... thankfully, I found the DVD version of the tape at amazon so I'm going to buy that.  I LOVE THIS WORKOUT.  I wouldn't be surprised if I'm still using this 60 years from now.  At least I hope I'll live that long.  :)",1247788800,,1762,3.8795518207282913
622693,5,6303284019,"This is ABsolutely (haha!) the best ab workout tape I've used!  Just simple, effective, difficult but do-able ab exercises, some fitness tapes try to hard to be inventive... gimmicky awkward workouts are impossible to stick to in the long run.  But this is just clean, easy to follow ab routines that are short enough to fit into you daily routine. I've been doing 1-2 workouts from this tape every morning for years and I'm still not bored with it!

If you want an ab workout you can actually stick to and stay motivated, this is it!!",1238716800,,535,4.552083333333333
622694,3,6303284019,"This dvd is truley an awesome ab workout. Stick with it and get more like it if you get bored with the same old easily. It's nice that there are 5 days of workouts. You can combine them when you get stronger. I'm really happy with my purchase. Here are the reasons that I didn't give it a full 5 stars... You have to fast forward to get to the other workouts. You cant just ""skip"" because it's not an option. Also the people look silly in their swimsuit/tights get up with ankle socks. And the music is a bit outdated and silly too. These things don't bother me though as long as I get what I wanted out of it, which is a great ab workout! And I do. For the ladies that thought they'd finally have a hot guy to workout with... It's a scam. The guy on the cover shows you how to start a position and then you workout with a group of people... he doesnt even join them. haha.

622696,1,6303284019,"I love this work out and did it on VHS for years. Gave me a 6 pack. I thought it would be great to move it to DVD. I pruchased the DVD and found out that you can't skip to any of the 5 work outs!!!!! It's a waste of the technology. It's actually easier to just leave the VHS tape right where it is, so that when you are ready to do day 1 or day 2 or day 3, you can just start the tape where you left it. With the DVD you have to fast forward through all the previous work outs and that gets old fast. The only other alternative is to leave the DVD on pause the whole time. It would be great if they would just include chapters.",1155600000,23,627,3.6865671641791047

622717,2,6303284019,"Okay, so the exercises ARE good. The abs exercises on most of the FIRM tapes that have them ARE good. But I still think it was a mistake ordering this tape for two reasons:

1. It's just a collection of routines from other, earlier FIRM tapes, so to me it pretty much seems like a rip-off. Also, get ready for some OLD ones there - from the time when instructors looked like Kate Moss and even guys were wearing pink and orange aerobics clothes. If you ever felt like you didn't quite enjoy looking at such things anymore - well, then you'll find this tape a visual disaster.

2. Who is this Tracy guy, for heaven's sake?! All he does is introducing the sets of exercises - half naked and looking as unnatural as a diamond ring on a homeless guy's pinky. He's ridiculous, but he's actually too annoying for me to be able to simply laugh at him.

Altogether, this tape was a disappointment and the two stars are strictly for the exercises.",1098489600,2,938,4.379310344827586
622718,5,6303284019,"I swear by 5 Day Abs! I never would have thought that 5 minutes could work out so much. They guarantee results in 10 days (5 days a week), and you'll be amazed at how toned you are after just two weeks. Starting out I was incredibly sore since I hadn't flexed an ab muscle in a few years, but I was able to make it through since it's only 5 minutes. I started out with Day 1 then rested a day, then Day 2 then rested a day, then finished the rest of the days with no break. As  I've gotten stronger I'll do all 5 days with no break. This is great whether you're just starting out trying to get rid of that pot belly or you're already buff and want to maintain without spending too much time. It is an old tape, definitely 80's but not too cheesy at all. All around, an awesome ab workout!",1091059200,17,788,3.9559748427672954
622719,5,6303284019,I love this tape because of the variety in exercises. You have 5 different workouts for each day and it works.  With a healty diet and exercise you will definitely see results in a matter of weeks if you are consistent.,1007856000,4,219,4.341463414634147
622720,5,6303284019,"I starting buying the FIRM tapes back in 1989 when they were fifty bucks a pop.  I added this as soon as it came out.  At first, I was disappointed -- there's nothing new in here; all of the 5 - 9 minute ab segments were cut from the long workout tapes I already owned.  However, once I started branching out into other tapes, or skipping the FIRM total body workouts all together, I became much more dependent on this tape.  It's so easy to find 5 - 9 minutes to workout; I can do these right after I roll out of bed (even with my jammies still on), and the exercises are so familiar I can keep my eyes closed & still make it through them while I'm half-asleep.  I don't know that my abs look any better, but they sure feel strong -- and I NEVER have the backaches that I used to have ten years ago.  The best part about this is that it's so short (and effective), it's hard to find an excuse for skipping it.  Two of the five segments require a FIRM ""step-up box,"" a stool used in the FIRM workout tapes.  Frankly, anything in the 12 - 20"" range that you could prop your feet up on would be effective.  I've got the whole array of FIRM step-up boxes, but on occasion, I'll just use a chair seat when it's most convenient.
I definitely agree with the ky reviewer that Stud Boy, our ""personal trainer,"" whose role is to introduce each of the five segments, is a bit much.  He does add comic relief -- My sister (who also owns the tape) & I have been known to call each other or comment while trying on clothes (using a Tracy James New Yorkish -- I guess -- accent ""Remember, you won't be able to see your firm new abs until you get rid of that ugly layer of fat.""  I find him an amusing annoyance, tolerable for the fifteen or so seconds he appears on each segment.
I don't have the second abs tape, but I'll definitely get it.  Although I haven't done so many of the FIRM tapes lately, I do own at least twelve of them (collected over twelve years -- ); I've discarded many, many, many other tapes over the years (Denise Austin, Jane Fonda, Jazzercise, Kathy Smith, . . . ).  They were enjoyable, but I got to a point where I didn't want to do them any more, and off they went to Salvation Army.  In contrast, I've never discarded a FIRM tape -- the early ones, in particular, really are good and for some reason, much less boring than other tapes.  This is the only ab tape I own now -- I used to have Abs of Steel ab segment tapes & a Joanie Greggains ab tape -- but this is the one I would always do -- and which I definitely prefer.  Now if I could only get rid of that ugly layer of fat . . .",994464000,16,2598,4.044921875
