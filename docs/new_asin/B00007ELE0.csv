7975411,5,B00007ELE0,"This concert looks like it was shot in a grade school auditorium but don't let that influence your opinion of the show. It's fantastic! Kim Wilson is in top form and the rest of the band is also terrific. I was so disapponted when I got the dvd and saw no orginal members in the group but Kim on the packaging, but it took all of about 30 seconds before I cracked a wide smile and realized these dudes are good and I was in for a good time. Nobody does blues/rockabilly better than the 'Birds",1269734400,,492,4.135416666666667

7975413,5,B00007ELE0,"This DVD has a full concert performance that's very good. It's a small venue with a real family feel. Like they invited friends to see the taping of the DVD. The singer is original, but I think all the other guys are new. They are all excellent players and fit the style of the Fabulous Thunderbirds perfectly. They have a horn section, backup singers, and a great piano player. The guitarist, Kid Ramos, is a good player and what's also cool about this DVD is that he gives lessons on two songs in the Bonus features with 5 camera angels. If you have a bit of experience, it'll be pretty easy to pick up these songs. Very cool feature for guitarists. I wish more DVD's had this.",1111968000,3,679,4.354330708661418
