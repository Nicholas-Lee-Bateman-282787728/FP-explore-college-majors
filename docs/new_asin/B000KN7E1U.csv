2696521,5,B000KN7E1U,"My 3-year old grandson is crazy about trains.  We have watched this video over and over again, several time a day. Great train sounds.  He loves it!!  I would recommend this for under 5-years.",1203033600,16,192,4.588235294117647
2696522,5,B000KN7E1U,"My two year old little boy has a fascination with trains so not knowing where to start, I ordered this one.  It was a great choice.  He would watch it every day several times a day if I would let him.  I have since checked out several from our local library and none have compared to this video.  This video is just as interesting to the parent as the child, and the clarity of the video is outstanding!  I highly recommend it.  It is worth every penny!",1202860800,7,453,4.149425287356322
2696523,5,B000KN7E1U,I gave this to my 3 year old grandson and he loved it and watches it almost every day.  The rest of us too enjoyed this great train DVD also. It is very informative and fun to watch. ***** Thanks.,1198972800,5,196,3.9
2696524,5,B000KN7E1U,"My nephew loves his Real Trains for Kids. He watches it every day without fail, sometimes three or four times in a row. And he walks around reciting the dialogue to anyone who'll listen. This is the best train video I have found. It explains a lot about trains that I didn't know. I even enjoyed watching it myself, it is so nicely put together. Highly recommended.",1196985600,15,365,4.462686567164179
2696525,5,B000KN7E1U,"This video holds the attention of both kids and adults.  It's built around the movement of trains -- lots of them, from lots of angles, with lots of satisfying whistles, brake screeches and clickety-clacks.  There's something  about the energy of trains that particularly holds the attention of little boys. and this video taps into that.  My son, my husband and I all were mesmerized.  An educational narrative laces the shots together clearly and enthusiastically but the video's emphasis is on showing trains in motion. Great photography.",1181520000,33,541,5.244186046511628
2696526,4,B000KN7E1U,"I ordered Trains for Kids 1 & 2 for my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson whose pregnant momma is confined to bed rest. He absolutely loves these videos and asks to watch them first thing every morning. I've learned a few new things about trains myself. Nothing particularly professional about the video itself, but I've enjoyed watching it again and again and again. Personally I find #1 a bit more interesting than #2, but Caleb typically asks for ""blue train"" [the cover color] first.",1315440000,,475,4.666666666666667
2696527,5,B000KN7E1U,My 4 year old nephew and his dad both love to watch this DVD. It was fun for them to watch real trains in action.  The whole family watched it at Christmas last year and we all enjoyed it. I plan on ordering Vol. 2 for his Christmas present this year.,1291766400,,251,3.9215686274509802
2696528,1,B000KN7E1U,"I purchased this item on 25 August 2010 but todate have not received the said item.  It should have reached me by now but it has not- so I am unable to review or for that matter comment about it!!  Would appreciate if someone can contact me and let me know whether the item has been sent and judging by the long period I would say that it has got lost in the post.  Would it be possible to re-send this item (which was for my five year old who is crazy about trains!) to my US mail box!??  Your assistance will be appreciated.

Thanks",1285545600,,534,4.0476190476190474
2696529,4,B000KN7E1U,"My son loves trains and he loves this video.  No silly voices (parents thank you for that)
Very educational, shows equipment and trains in a variety of settings, cheesy dated music but my son doesn't mind.",1282003200,,205,4.694444444444445
2696530,5,B000KN7E1U,"This DVD completely captivates my almost 2 1/2 year old.  I was a little skeptical because it's a very simple DVD featuring footage of various trains in different locations interspersed with a few other things like work being done on tracks, etc., but my son loves it.  He can watch it over & over again, & it holds his complete attention, unlike the handful of cartoon DVDs we let him watch.  I only bought one, so will be buying the 2nd one, too.  It's true that most of the trains are diesel, as a critical reviewer mentioned, but that doesn't matter to my son.",1267833600,2,564,4.394230769230769
2696531,5,B000KN7E1U,"My 2 yearold nephew loves trains so, i got him this DVD for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it.  Great DVD for little kids who love trains.",1266710400,2,139,4.3076923076923075
2696532,5,B000KN7E1U,My 9 year old son is autistic and loves trains.  I found this DVD on amazon.com and ordered it immediately for him for Christmas.  He's crazy about it!  He can watch it over and over and not get bored.,1265673600,4,201,4.102564102564102
2696533,5,B000KN7E1U,"My two-year-old son absolutely loves trains.  This DVD and the sequel (Real Trains for Kids 2) are fantastic for the younger viewer.

This is his DVD of choice that he asks for over and over again.",1264204800,,197,4.444444444444445
2696534,5,B000KN7E1U,My 2 year old Grandson loves this dvd. He will sit and watch the entire dvd then ask to see it again!!,1262044800,,102,3.6818181818181817
2696535,5,B000KN7E1U,"I purchased this dvd for my five year old grandson.  He is a big Thomas fan, but begs to see the ""real"" trains.  He would rather watch this than any cartoons.

2696536,5,B000KN7E1U,"My two year old son loves trains so we choose this dvd so he could see trains whenever he wanted. Great choice, he would watch it all day if we let him. I think if we had bought it earlier all the noise and sounds might have scared him, so you might not buy it for a child younger than two. The dvd is really fun and a good choice if your child likes trains.",1256256000,2,358,3.7866666666666666
2696537,5,B000KN7E1U,"Excellent video as promised, if your child can't get enough of trains then this video is for you!",1252800000,,97,4.444444444444445
2696538,5,B000KN7E1U,I bought this for my grandson who is 2 1/2years old. He loves it. He watches it over and over. I am considering purchasing the next DVD in the series.,1246838400,,150,4.033333333333333
2696539,5,B000KN7E1U,My son told me that my grandsons just cannot get enough of this DVD.  They have watched it traveling in their car and at home.  I am so glad they are enjoying it!,1245024000,,162,3.878787878787879
2696540,3,B000KN7E1U,"The video is good, but it doesn't show many steam trains, only two in fact.

The production quality is great, image quality very crisp and the audio is also great. My 3 year old watched it and enjoyed it but he is really more interested in steam trains than diesel engines.",1232668800,6,273,4.352941176470588
2696541,5,B000KN7E1U,"I bought this for my 4-year-old son who LOVES trains and he's riveted by it.  The narrator has a sort-of nasally voice and a small New York accent, but that is the only ""bad"" thing I can say about it, which is nothing.  At the end of the video there is a part where you can count the cars (there are over 100!) on a long freight train.  We crack up listening to my son count 1-13 and then start back over at 1 again and keep going 1-13 until the train passes and the DVD ends.  HIGHLY recommend - I grew up the son of a railfan and there were a few things I didn't know and hadn't seen before.  Very, very cool.",1232496000,,611,3.8951612903225805
2696542,5,B000KN7E1U,"If your kids like trains, this is the best thing since peanut butter.  Admittedly the videography/production is a bit amateurish - (felt as though why didn't I think of this and then sell it) ha - then again someone had to take a lot of time to set up tripods, get the perfect angles - and maybe had some connections with timing of the horns etc. and they have locomotives from various lines in the country.  Great! It is just what other reviewers have said - just a lot of video of engines coming and so forth - but still interesting tidbits mentioned along the way and most importantly - both my 2-1/2 and 4-1/2 year old boys are RIVETED from the time it starts till the time it stops - about 30 min. I think and just enough time to get dinner on the table.",1231891200,,759,4.191780821917808
2696543,5,B000KN7E1U,"This dvd is awesome! My son who is a little over 2 goes bananas when this comes on! I just got it yesterday in the mail, he has watched it like 7 times. I read the reviews before buying, and they were right! Perfect for kids 2-4. Mainly just train shots, not an annoying narrator or cheesy talking. Plain and simple: videos of trains.",1225497600,3,334,4.234375
2696544,5,B000KN7E1U,"We would prefer that our child not watch TV, but when we started planning for a 5+ hour plane ride (each way) we decided we needed video help.  We ordered this video and some construction videos.  This is by far his favorite.  He's 18 months old now and absolutely loves this video.  When we do let him watch it, we watch it together.  He loves pointing out the colors of the trains and seeing the guys driving or flags on the trains.  We even enjoy watching it with him.  The music and narration are good.",1214265600,3,506,4.2631578947368425
2696545,5,B000KN7E1U,"This has quickly become my son's favorite video.  He's four years old, so he's begun to grow out of Thomas, but his passion for trains is chugging along strong.  This movie is great, with narrations and explanations that really inspire him.  It's even more exciting to him that we've ridden on the ""number 40"" (New Hope and Ivyland) that is featured.

I like that there is an educational twist, it has added all sorts of words and concepts to my son's vocabulary.

One complaint only.  As a mom, though, the soundtrack music is a little repetitive and annoying, and it gets stuck in my head.  Other than that, this movie is great!",1209340800,4,630,4.571428571428571
8158348,5,B000KN7E1U,"Love it. So entertaining for children, and adults.",1444003200,,50,5.375
8158349,4,B000KN7E1U,"My son (now 3 years old) has been watching this DVD faithfully for the last year and for that reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating. I can't stand watching it, poorly filmed, poorly edited and for some reason extremely loud. I have to turn the volume down to 5 on the TV or you can hear it in the whole house. But my son loves it so much, we bought Real Trains For Kids 2, which is even worse, yet, mysteriously more loved. Will probably buy a second copy in case something happens to the first.",1423526400,,494,4.051020408163265
8158350,5,B000KN7E1U,My son love it!!!!,1417651200,,18,3.75
8158351,5,B000KN7E1U,My Grandson is addicted to trains....all about trains.  So I try to get him anything that is educational about trains.  He really enjoys the movies and I have 2 more grandsons coming up under him to pass them along to.,1390780800,,218,4.425
8158352,5,B000KN7E1U,my train crazy son has probably watched this 40 times.... it's old production but for kids that like trains.... there is something addicting about it.  Glad I bought it.  Highly recommended.,1386460800,,190,5.096774193548387
8158353,4,B000KN7E1U,"I like that this shows real trains and not cartoon characters. The naration is pleasant and informative without being boring or distracting. We don't allow much TV, but my 3 year old enjoys this one.",1382400000,,199,4.714285714285714
8158354,5,B000KN7E1U,"Purchased the video as a Christmas gift for my 2 yr old nephew and he loves it.  He walks up to the tv, pats it and says choo choo when he wants to see it, which is often.  I don't know what the attraction is because I can't sit through the whole thing but he just wants to see it over and over again.  What I do like is that it's not fast moving and the scenes don't change quickly which is better for his brain development than fast moving cartoons with a lot of action sequences.",1330214400,,482,3.948453608247423
8158355,5,B000KN7E1U,"I bought this for my 2 year old son for Christmas because he loves trains.  Well, he LOVES watching this DVD!  He can watch it over and over and not get tired of it!  The music and narration are a little cheesy for my taste, but it's his video, so it's what he thinks that matters.  I am definitely not sorry I chose this DVD!",1327104000,,326,3.9692307692307693
8158356,5,B000KN7E1U,OMG! I cant believe i did not buy this before! i had it bought for a christmas gift but gave it to my two yrd old early as he will not stop asking to use my iphone or laptop to watch train videos on youtube!! his daddy instisted that i open it NOW! all he keeps saying is this is a cool new movie mommy! he enjoys it and that is all that matters! i read many reviews of others before purchasing this one! I like how there is a narrator as well asking simple questions and saying simple things like how many engines does this train have. It keeps his attention and all moms will agree that even a few minutes of your two yr old being entertained is valuable!! i highly recomend~,1320364800,,677,4.059701492537314
8158357,5,B000KN7E1U,my little boy is 3 and has always liked trains. I have bought him all kinds of toys and dvds dealing with trains. this dvd set is the best investment I've made.,1319241600,,160,4.03125
