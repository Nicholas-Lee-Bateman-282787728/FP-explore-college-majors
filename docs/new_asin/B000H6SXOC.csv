8137105,4,B000H6SXOC,"Cou and Ren have been sent out to earn some money by Cisqua but the only option to do that is to fight in a nightly gladiatorial display put on for the city elite. Unknown to them, Cisqua, Rowen, and Kuea have already infiltrated the establishment and are waiting for backup from Arc Aile. It's not going to be pretty when Cou and Ren have to face Rasati, who is fighting to free herself and Lillia from a mountain of debt and the danger that her adopted sister will be taken from her. If she can just win one more battle, they will be free! But that one battle is with Cou and Ren!

Elemental Gelade continues to get more interesting with each volume as we begin to realize that everyone around Cou and Ren is a potential enemy, owing to the great power Ren possesses and the fact that Cou must be eliminated for another to use her. Even Arc Aile is shown to have its own sinister motives, which had already been hinted at in an earlier episode where an Edel Raid didn't want to return to them because the ""paradise"" she had been promised had turned into a prison. Cou and Ren continue to change the destinies of the good people they meet, but neither can ever relax their guard. I really hope they make it to Edel Garden where they can find peace and find out who this mysterious figure called ""Eve"" is. The animation can be a bit subpar at times, but the characterization makes up for it. Ren's character, which seemed like a weak point in the story, continues to grow with each episode as she begins to realize her bond, if not her feelings, for Cou. There would be a lot less misunderstandings with both the leads if they could just get their love out in the open. To round things out, Gelade really pours on the humor when needed. A good show.",1163808000,,1749,4.3
