5726512,1,B00CMDPTPY,"Not at all what I expected. Thought it would be a documentary about the Korean War.  Reasons why started, reason we got into it, hardships  the men faced, the battles,etc  It was basically 50's military propaganda films all strung together.  If you want to see an excellent DVD about the Korean war, and get a better (and true) understanding of the sacrifices and hardships the soldiers  faced, rent or buy, "" Chosin"". It is excellent.",1418083200,11,435,4.746666666666667

5726520,2,B00CMDPTPY,"Disappointing.  An endless series of US Government PR films, i.e, propaganda, without any critical analysis or commentary by experts or any interesting interviews with veterans.  The narration is pompous and self-congratulatory.  The few interviews are obviously scripted and staged.  There are serious omissions of fact, e.g., MacArthur disobeying orders not to advance to the Yalu, the warnings that the Chinese had delivered prior to their assault, and more.  Worth a look only if you want to see what cold-war era rhetoric looked and sounded like.  For a serious treatment try ""Korea:  The Forgotten War.""",1404691200,8,609,5.414893617021277
5726521,5,B00CMDPTPY,I found this online and thought it would be great gift for my grandpa. He loves finding pics or movies related to Korean war.,1402790400,,125,4.25
5726522,5,B00CMDPTPY,This product brings back many of the events and actions my father encountered during his 2 1/2 years in Korea. I only regret that he was never able to take part in enjoying this collection,1400112000,2,188,4.4
5726523,5,B00CMDPTPY,"If you love history plus the sacrifices that have been made for others and ourselves as part of societies, you will love this set.  It does have some good old Army propaganda, but what would history be without it?  In short, I really enjoy going back into time and seeing how people lived and how they conquered the stones in the path.  One last item, the price is great for the information.",1399248000,3,391,4.402777777777778
5726524,4,B00CMDPTPY,Pretty good analysis.  As a Korean War vet I am teching a course - as a volunteer - at a local senior center which has some 40 people attending.,1398643200,2,144,3.9655172413793105
5726525,4,B00CMDPTPY,Great for those unfamiliar with the tradgedy of this conflict. Get a sense of this conflict while participants are still alive.,1393286400,,127,5.095238095238095
5726526,5,B00CMDPTPY,"5 DVD disks, with a lot of 30 minute episodes of ""The Big Picture"" from the early 1950's.
Mostly US Gov't propaganda on the ""Korean War"", but lots of new footage from the ""Forgotten War"".",1388102400,5,187,4.371428571428571
5726527,5,B00CMDPTPY,Better than anticipated. Very good selection of clips. Bonus movie selection unexpected but very good. Would recommend to interested friends.,1387756800,4,141,6.1
5726528,2,B00CMDPTPY,"This ""documentary"" was produced and narrated at the time of the war. There is no really good analysis of the war. Each segment begins with an Army officer giving a quick overview of the topic complete with all the ""red scare"" rhetoric of the times. The 3rd disk is supposed to have more Korean War topics. Instead it consists of a group of B movies mostly about WWII. The topics listed on the back of the holder are not present.",1386633600,10,428,4.3625
5726529,5,B00CMDPTPY,I am always on the hunt to find something that is well done on the Korean War.  My father was in the 9th division.  I bought this hoping my dad would enjoy it.  Wow did he ever!!!  He went through the first DVD in one sitting!!!  Thank you Mr. Davis for making this available!!!,1386460800,8,278,4.074074074074074

8583304,3,B00CMDPTPY,It was an interesting documentary about the war done by the US Army's sponsored show The Big Picture.  It had interviews with veterans shortly after the war.  I returned my because DVD one did not have sound when I played it. The edges of the case looked beat up a little so maybe it was used.  The movies one the fourth dvd are not that good. I would have kept it if DVD one played correctly.  For $5 its not bad.,1425340800,,414,4.074074074074074

8583306,5,B00CMDPTPY,Good chronological presentation of a little known subject. This deserves to be shown in our high schools to illustrate how the US sent American men to halt and turn back it's aggression we paid the high cost of opposing communism. As a retired HS Social Studies/History teacher and veteran of the Vietnam War I was shocked how little my colleagues and students knew about the conflict and most do not know that American troops are still deployed on Korean soil helping to defend our Allies there.,1421712000,,496,4.77906976744186
