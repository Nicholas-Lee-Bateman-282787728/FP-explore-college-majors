5689480,1,B00C2XL66U,This musical math DVD must be the biggest prank ever. I have never felt so ripped off my entirely life. It is nothing but 1 minute songs about nothing. Shredding your $15 is far better than buying this DVD. I won't even take it for free had I known.,1380499200,2,249,4.1020408163265305

8576850,4,B00C2XL66U,"This video consists of a teacher demonstrating actions for her math songs with the words underneath her on the screen.  A number of the songs have music from the 70's, 80's, and 90's.  Other songs sound like kids' music.  My 2 year old enjoys it.  I don't know how well a lower elementary child would like this as the concepts are geared towards Kindergarten and 1st grade, I think.  Check out her website to see samples before you buy.",1397001600,,436,4.468354430379747

8576853,5,B00C2XL66U,"My daycare and I watch the different Heidi's songs DVD's all the time!  They love dancing to the silly, catchy songs.  They are great for learning early math and reading skills.  I also highly recommend her sight words DVD's, my own children really improved their reading skills using these and I have 3 and 4 year olds who are learning to read in a fun, non stressful way.",1384214400,,373,4.455882352941177
