4587955,5,B0056EBI0G,If history interests you at all you must have this. It will give you a physical sense of the times. These images now live in my mind like memories. Albert Kahn was a genius and gifted the world with a treasure. Take advantage of his gift to you.,1358726400,2,245,4.125

4587957,5,B0056EBI0G,"It is surprising to me that more people do not know the name of Albert Kahn.  At the turn of the 20th century, he bankrolled a private team of photographers to document many of the cultures of the world, particularly those that might be on the verge of disappearing due to the rapid political changes or industrialization of the day. Albert Kahn was - in a sense - the National Geographic all rolled up into one person.

His goal, as a French Jew and a very rich banker, was to foster world understanding...perhaps even world peace. In the context of visible anti-semitism in Europe, he hoped that his historic record of cultures, even inaccessible cultures, would document the humanity of all the world's peoples.

100 years ago, Albert Kahn used the latest technology to make an authentic record of the adventure.  He used black and white moving pictures and he used color still photography. No...these are not hand tinted photos...they are color plates of stunning intensity...produced by the autochrome process. Before the invention of technicolor film, he even used color moving pictures to document the Paris he loved. This is a true time machine.

This 10 part program simply has to be seen to be believed.  The beauty of some of these photographs is mind-blowing - rich hues of color unknown to most of today's photographers. They are neither like impressionist paintings nor modern prints. They are like portraits and landscapes captured in Venetian glass.  Some of the pictures are the first color photographs ever taken in some lands...such as Mongolia or the Balkans

My two favorite color photographs?  One is of an old woman smoking a pipe in Palestine. The other is of a WWI French soldier in his blue uniform sitting in a deserted plaza eating his lunch.

Albert Kahn was a committed pacifist - a word we hear too little today.  Let us pray, hope, and work towards his goal of understanding the deep humanity of all the world's peoples.  Let us search for ways to bring people together rather than exact revenge or justice for past misdeeds.

Those traveling to Paris should check out the museum devoted to this remarkable individual, his moving pictures,  his color autochrome plates, and his extraordinary gardens.  I also strongly recommend the companion book - The Dawn of the Color Photograph - that goes with this program.",1319846400,27,2344,4.883838383838384
8459454,5,B0056EBI0G,Must see for any photograph. Also fantastic for anyone who want to learn about the time leading up to WW I and the soldiers lives during the war.,1518134400,,145,4.214285714285714

8459456,1,B0056EBI0G,"I haven't checked out the content yet. But the DVD box has a lot of scratches and proof of purchase is  scratched as well. It's really sad because I have a very high hope for the DVD box, for collection purpose :(

UPDATED: Disc 2 is broken. I'm really sad.",1489708800,,257,4.12
8459457,5,B0056EBI0G,"What a blast from the past, sentimental journey and a window in to the very soul of pure cultures.  Amazed that we didn't see this in school as a part of a history class.",1463875200,,170,4.0
8459458,5,B0056EBI0G,"Amazing photos, amazing quality.  I really wish it were available in blu-ray...",1448409600,,79,5.583333333333333

8459460,5,B0056EBI0G,"This is a wonderful 10-part BBC documentary on the very early color photographs and B&W movies commissioned by Albert Kahn in the early part of the 20th century. The selection is extensive, and each topic is well covered. Highly recommended to anyone who likes period photographs. Most interesting for me was the section on the Middle East at the end of the second DVD. You see the Greeks attack and then have to withdraw from Anatolia, the Brits marching into Jerusalem at the end of WWI, etc. Fascinating.",1406160000,2,507,4.7727272727272725
8459461,5,B0056EBI0G,This is something you'll never have a chance to see if you don't buy this DVD.  Remarkable footage and fascinating to watch.,1404000000,,124,4.636363636363637
8459462,5,B0056EBI0G,"wonderfull. i saw this a while back in a dubbed version and it blew my mind. Most people just don't know that there was indeed a way to take colour photograpies -before- world war one (yes, real colour photos, not just recoloured) . the millionair albert kahn spent a fortune to send photographers to around the world to take pictures to create an archive on how the world looked like back then. I highly recommend this to anyone with some interest in history.",1386288000,,460,4.554216867469879
8459463,5,B0056EBI0G,"I had never heard of Albert Kahn when I saw this BBC series at our library.  I bought it and find it one of the most fascinating I've seen - the quality of the photos and films from 1909-1920s is far better, and the color is truer, than one could imagine. And Kahn's wish to preserve the fast-disappearing cultures world-wide is extraordinary.  This is worth every penny and you'll want to share it with your friends (please do!) if you care about history and culture.",1381363200,3,468,4.4941176470588236
