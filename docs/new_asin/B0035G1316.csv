4070307,2,B0035G1316,"This movie is Desperately in need of some dubbing.

The English subtitles (difficult to find in the poor menu system) often flashed on the screen for a second or two. So if you can get over the spelling mistakes and can read very fast you may be happy.

They probably could've paid some college drama students a few thousand dollars to dub this movie.

I much preferred the USA version ""Voyage to the End of the Universe"".  (Unless of course you speak German.)",1337040000,6,460,4.506024096385542
4070308,2,B0035G1316,"I had hopes for this legendary Czech space odyssey from 1963, but it's not good. Like a few other Soviet bloc scifi films I've seen, it's painfully slow. Really, almost nothing happens. Half the film is about the crew feeling drowsy. I'm not kidding. Most of the rest of the film is about the crew acting all mopey and gloomy and, well, Eastern European. Some of the art direction and camerawork is nice, but the FX and models are pre-Rocky Jones and sub-Fireball XL-5. Like a lot of Stanislaw Lem's stories, the science is terribly dork. The subtitles are awful, too. It has its moments -- the scene where they encounter another ship, thrown in only to get in a few jabs at evil capitalists, is the best, and you can watch that clip on youtube.",1336176000,,745,4.485294117647059
4070309,5,B0035G1316,"I remember watching this movie in a theatre as a kid (1964) paired with ""Godzilla vs The Thing"". I was enthralled by it though it was the english language version titled ""Voyage To The End of the Universe"". I was thrilled when the original Czech version with original ending was available and in its original WS aspect ratio. This version is superior to the english version released in the US and the ending makes more sense, as opposed the ""americanized"" alternate ending. It played flawlessly in my region free DVD player (Pioneer DV610av). The only complaint I have is the English subtitles  somtimes flash in and out too quickly to read but you still get the gist of what the actors are speaking. Still worth 5 stars",1303948800,14,720,4.669291338582677
4070310,4,B0035G1316,"I highly recommend this original Czech version of a moody B&W classic. The English subtitles are intermittent, full of typos, and a little skittish at times (there are occasions where you may want to pause the DVD to read a subtitle that's on the screen for a second or less) but ultimately it's the lighting, tone and set design that make this film worth watching. Sure, some of the spacehip walls have ripples in them and the ship wobbles a bit when moving through space, but overall it's a really nice-looking film. And there's a fair amount of subtlety in the performances too. This may bore folks who prefer the ham-fisted acting typical of today's Sci-Fi films. I have to mention the great quirky music. Also fantastic. Especially the dance scene. Yes, there is a dance club (of sorts) on board the ship.

8388965,5,B0035G1316,"After waiting many years for this film to appear on tape or DVD (uncut with English subtitles), I was delighted to learn of this. I received DVD a few weeks ago, and already watched it twice. Ground-breaking film... even though it's clearly dated now, it still stands out in many ways, and is far superior to perhaps all other space movies from that era... a must for science-fiction fans or collectors of quality films.",1512086400,3,420,4.6891891891891895
8388966,5,B0035G1316,"(this is based on my memories of the Americanized version and the captioned version in Czech that was afterward removed from YouTube. I've not viewed the dvd. If it plays ok on American machines, it's a must-have.)

Ikarie XB-1, aka voyage to the end of the universe is a wonderful movie. made in 1963, it presages 2001 in terms of grandeur and scale. Like 2001, it is decidedly understated and avoids the pulp fiction plotting and production shoddiness that characterizes so much science fiction of that time. just ordinary men and women doing something extra-ordinary.

there are no rapacious aliens seeking earth women. no alien invaders advanced enough to cross the gulf of space yet unprepared for our microbiota. no star destroyers and flashy, earth shattering ka-booms. i don't know about anyone else, but getting to crew the first ship to another solar system would be plenty exciting fro me. and dealing with the problems bound to arise on such a mission would be as challenging as anyone could ask for. anyone who says nothing happens in the movie should tell that to the dead crew and to the scarred-out-of-their-wits by the radaition scare crew. not to mention the thoroughly ecstatic to be traveling to another solar system crew.

most of the movie was a blur to me and a few scenes stood out hauntingly. the deranged Michael blasts a camera and later blasts the robot patrick. before the blasting, anthony's robot patrick roams the ship calling for anthony while the crew is unconscious from radiation posioning. the derelcit US space ship and the explosion that kills ikaries away team. most memorably, the final scenes in which shots of the newborn baby and the crew alternate with stock footage of new york city. <<americanized version. czech version ends differently>>

that ending captured my imagination with the implication that Ikarie was a colony ship. The colony it carried would in time have grown into the human civilization we all know and love today, epitomized by the wonder-city of the mid 20th century, new york, new york. this ending fits in nicely with the american pioneer mythos. a mighty civilization arising from the labors of a few intrepid explorers. this was a staple of some mid 20th century science fiction-- the extra terrestrial origin of humanity. we see it in (off the top of my head) Richard Matheson's third from the sun, niven's known space and chad oliver's transfusion. particularly tranfusion.

as captivating as it was, the ending sums up the glaring difference between the czech and american  version. in journey to the end of the universe ikarie travels from another world to the green planet-- earth. in ikarie xb-1 a multi national crew travels from earth to alpha centauri and the white planet orbiting it. in the original, it is views of the white planet's surface that alternate with views of the crew and the newborn baby.

it may be that the american version no longer exists. a pity that. despite its faults. the ending offers a much more interesting ending than Ikarie. we discovered a vastly advanced civilization that managed to completely pave over their planet. instead, its we've discovered a green planet and will eventually pave it over(?). I'm conflicted in how I feel about that. hell, both movies end with the ecstasy of triumph.

one of the similarities between 2001 and ikarie xb-1 is the on board computer. though not evidencing HAL""s level of AI, Ikarie's computer is able to carry on the ship's mission after the crew is incapacitated and does so. Unlike HAL, it does not psychopathically murder the crew. Like HAL, it does interrupt the festivities of a birthday party. The general alarm sends all 80 crew scurrying to their stations. It's down right comical watching them run to the turbolifts. A HAL-like understatement that sensors were showing something unexpected would have probably  been more a propos, but I did not design the bloody computer. the urgency of it all feels like a plot hole. maybe something got lost in the closed-captioning.

Unlike Discovery, Ikarie is more expansive than most spaceships in the movies. Not until battlestar galacitca do we see such a large, uncluttered bridge. the crew quarters are of a scale such as those in Star Trek and the common areas are as well. spaceships before star trek and 2001 came in two basic shapes: cigars with fins and saucers. uniquely, ikarie's shape is an oblate lozenge, rather like a barge. its shuttles are saucer shaped, but the main ship is strikingly different.

the shuttle detaches from the derelict US ship and orbits at a safe distance. in 2001, we have round utility pods with mechanical hands for making repairs. The Ikarie crew does the fine detail work, (which is how Michael gets the dose of radiation that deranges his mind.) but turns the job over to the robots that are centrally controlled by the ship's computer. a pity they don't do the same when they need to burn thrugh to where michael has barricaded himself. Anthony is RC'ing patrick, who gets blasted by michael. the cool part is this may be the first time an RC 'bot is used to deal with a dangerously deranged person.

i remembered patrick as being portrayed by robbie-the-robot, but this was wrong. patrick has a rounded head glass than that, more like the robot in lost in space, and is shorter. the lost in space robot is fully AI, autonomous and goal seeking. if patrick were ever AI, he's demented now and his malapropisms provide amusement to the crew and consternation to anthony. his search down the long corridors for anthony, whom he follows like a lost puppy, is moving and emotionally engaging.

the movie forays briefly into political polemic with the exploration of the derelict US ship. it dates from the 1980's and is obviously the product of the evil, decadent, violent, ugly history of late 20th century America. (bear in mind it was made in 1960's Czechoslovakia.) the ikarie is launched in the 2100's, and their attitude toward the 20th century is much like that of star trek's federation-- thank God we finally outgrew the folderol of that phase. Sol system has been explored and the vast wealth it contains has been exploited to the betterment of man. as in star trek, or Clarke's 3001 for that matter, we get the sense of a happy, capable, prosperous people preparing to moveout into the galaxy and unfettered by want or greed or cupidity. the captain curses the stupidity that has led to the deaths of his away team and moves on.",1490918400,,6478,4.84629294755877

8388969,5,B0035G1316,"I watched Ikare XB-1 on a 50 inch screen with a video projector and it looked and sounded great. As usual, I think Amazon is mixing and matching reviews from various releases of this film. Get the Second Run DVD version which is not only restored, but less expensive on Amazon UK: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00CP5VXWW
Reviews of other DVD releases of the film complain about quality and the English subtitles -- both of which are fine on the Second Run release.  The film itself is a marvel -- great sets, solid acting and an interesting plot. Clearly Gene Roddenberry and Stanley Kubrick both saw Ikare XB-1. Shouldn't you?",1390003200,3,625,4.89622641509434

8388971,4,B0035G1316,"This review is of the Second Run DVD release in Region 2 format. This is the original title as it was released as 'Voyage to the end of the Universe' in the States. This film is seen by many as an almost lost classic in the genre of sci-fi. Made in 1963 in the then Czechoslovakia, it is based on the book The Magellana Cloud by Polish  author Stanislav Lem. It tells the story of a group of humans who have been sent to the next nearest universe where there is a likelihood that they will be able to find a habitable planet. The year this is taking place is in the year 2163.

The further they go from Earth the less they are able to keep in contact with their families and base. Once communications are cut they then realise how isolated they are and then cabin fever starts to creep in  despite the huge size of the ship. What this film really seems to be is straddling the 1950s type if sci-fi which to be honest I absolutely love like say The Day The Earth Stood Still, or War of the Worlds and I hate the remakes of both of them, and the new wave of science fiction like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Star Trek etc. Actually what I really enjoyed about it was spotting all the ideas that others had blagged for their shows or films.

The sets are really good and comparisons to the original Dr. Who are probably unfair as this is quite a bit better. The sfx are surprisingly good too and if you get a feeling of dj vu a few times it will be because this did it first, the eagle eyed amongst you will see where the Alien franchise got a few ideas from too. Check out the dance party if you can keep a straight face at the futuristic dance moves, then you are truly a better man than I  or indeed woman.

This is undoubtedly an important film, but as some critics have said it is a bit on the slow side in places but then so was Kubricks effort in my opinion. It also lacks pizzazz; well space is a vacuum don't you know. That said you do have to concentrate in a few places but it has more than one cliff hanger and loads of ideas thrown in so I found it to be a really worthwhile watch. I love seeing how cinema has developed and for me that was the real charm of this film. If it lacks technical merit it does so only by todays standards. The acting and direction are all ruddy good and the space suits are rather good for the era too. If you are a fan of science fiction and/ or a film buff then you should find something here to keep you entertained.",1382140800,7,2454,4.059917355371901
8388972,5,B0035G1316,"Found this film on YouTube, and spent most of one night watching it - thankfully, it had subtitles, and I was able to follow the plot.  Quite different from other science fiction films, Ikarie XB1 is a character-driven film, which has a couple of fine set-pieces which push it more in the direction of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q66J1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] than more typical late 50s sci-fi like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocketship-X-M/dp/B000YDT5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocketship X-M</a>.  First, the actors are increasingly pressured by the long journey they are making - loneliness and paranoia alternately take their tolls on various crew members, leading to some very sweet moments in shy courtship early on, and later, nearly lead to the ship's destruction at the end.  Along the way, one astronaut discovers that his wife voluntarily chose not to accompany him, knowing that due to time-dilation, she would age faster than him by staying behind; also, an old ""ghost ship"" is found with some very dangerous cargo, and this encounter, as well as it's unforeseen aftermath, are what drives the plot to it's fitting conclusion.  Filmed in widescreen B/W, this DVD release is the best I've found, although yes, it's REGION 2 and won't play on anything except region-free players, and the menus are all in Czechoslovakian, although there is an English-language subtitle track for the movie.  There's also a plethora of bonus features, although also, not in English.  The film design is quite arresting, with a unique ship design, both inside and out, which I thought very intriguing.  Although I know some people will find this film slow-moving, I was riveted by it, and thought it a much more rewarding, cerebral outing than typical American sci-fi of the era.",1374451200,5,1960,5.856140350877193
8388973,3,B0035G1316,"Oh this is so painful!
I watched the modified-for-US-audience version of this film back around 1965 in the Arcadia Theater, Kerrville Texas.  I was just shy of puberty.
This film was refreshingly different from what was served up as Science Fiction film up to that point.  It had characters and interpersonal dynamics that seemed , and the plot line was centered on those dynamics rather than some trumped up alien threat.  The film was plainly sliced up prior to release in the USA, and of course it was dubbed.
I have always wanted to see XB-1 in its original form, in its original language, even though that language was Czech, and I do not speak Czech.  But along came  this DVD, and it promised that this was the real deal, the original un-compromised prime example of Eastern European, Iron Curtain era science fiction.

Alas, just because it is a DVD, and just because this is the 21st Century, and just because all kinds of media are interchanged internationally, this recording is only in Czech.  There is no selection menu allowing for language subtitles.  It is in Czech.  Only in Czech.

If you are fluent in Czech, by all means, buy this DVD.",1368576000,3,1155,4.673267326732673
