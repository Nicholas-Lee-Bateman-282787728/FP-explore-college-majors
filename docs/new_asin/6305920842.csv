7900914,3,6305920842,"We produced this video: Amazon.com are the ones who decided to only show the front cover and title of the slipcover: if you could see the FRONT & BACK it is very clear what is contained in the video: the 2 Mens events ( about 25 minutes together ) followed by the 2 Lady's Matches which are the Main Event's and together run over 30 minutes;  furthermore, color bleeding will only occur if you attempt to illegally duplicate: the tapes are produced for play, not duplication: ordinary use will play OK.

If the tape were defective, Amazon will give a refund or exchange within 30 days, but of course the tape plays well, it only color shifts if there is an attempt at illicit duplication.
I find it interesting that the previous reviewer recommends LPWA videos instead of ours: LPWA did not copy-protect their videos, and now they have suffered great losses to piracy: we've learned from experience and offer no apologies for copy-guarding our programs -- it is an unfortunate necessity.
The previous reviewer's complaint that the wrestling and video are sub-par are specious: it was good enough for the reviewer to
attempt to steal it via piracy. Whether or not you like the wrestling is a matter of taste, but the videography was a professional 3 camera shoot done by Kern Video: if you've seen college football games from Ohio, you've seen their work: it's
quite good by most standards.
We also provide all of our contact information on the video jacket and in the program titles & credits.  If the tape were
defective the previous reviewer could have contacted us directly.
Copy Protection is not a defect.",1073865600,,1610,4.742857142857143
