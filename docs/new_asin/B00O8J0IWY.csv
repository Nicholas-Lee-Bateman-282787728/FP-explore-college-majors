6729277,2,B00O8J0IWY,"***1st Off - DON'T READ TIPPER'S REVIEW unless you're seeking crib sheets for the entire movie script.***

COMPARISON - this is much less of a ""Chained"" (with Vincent D'Onofrio) and much more like a ""Mommy Dearest"" (except add a few blood splatters and remove all the talent).  In my opinion, the DVD cover is definitely not representative of the film.
I never tire of the drag her to a dungeon theme and this appeared as a decent spin on the scenario so I was a bit pumped to check it out!  Sadly, Casey Chapman was the major fail for me.  Major.  I definitely didn't think he was believable and find him a little too feminine for his don't frock with me facial expressions to be taken the least bit seriously.  Whenever I spend the 2nd half of a movie hoping it will either be over soon or wishing for someone besides myself to be tortured, I can't recommend it.  Wait for a Prime viewing, if it was free I mayyyyyy have considered a third star.

Nahhhhhhh.",1421193600,6,959,4.409090909090909
6729278,1,B00O8J0IWY,"I appear to be in the minority when it comes to my opinion of this movie.  When I ran across this movie,  the description and the pics made me think it would be edgy and borderline obscene.  It is neither.  I found it boring and dull.  Here's the movie in a nutshell.  I man has an obsession with lactating breasts.  In the first few minutes of the movie we see that he has already enslaved one woman, but for whatever reason (boredom?) he kills her.  He then needs another slave to satisfy his fetish.  He kidnaps a young woman jogging with a stroller (leaving the stroller and the baby behind), he finds out that she is not the mother of the baby but the aunt and therefore not lactating.  He then proceeds over the next several months to try an induce lactation through chemical means.  When the chemicals don't work, he then gives her a turkey baster with his semen so she can become pregnant and lactate, with plans on leaving the baby at a hospital.  This movie would have been more entertaining, to me, with more nudity (there's almost none in the movie), and violence.  The whole movie is just him cooking gourmet meals for his slave and his slave refusing to eat them because she doesn't agree with how animals are treated when they are turned into food.  In the end her captor seems to have a crisis of conscious and kills himself, she is rescued and although her sister encourgages her to ""go to the clinic"" (aka get an abortion), she apparently has decided to give birth to her turkey baster baby.",1420761600,8,1509,4.44
6729279,3,B00O8J0IWY,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot) com says: This film is hard to to recommend as the subject matter is so turn-the-stomach creepy. That's a good thing for horror film's but film viewer-wise there are such odd choices made - mostly at its start and the ever-dreaded second ending. The old Spielberg  ""A.I syndrome"", you think the film is over, and other than a kinda awkwardly shot last few frames, you're content. But, no. The director says differently and tags on an extra ending that is just so stupid you now almost forget the good parts you've just seen.

I digress a tad...story goes, a mental-case hidden in regular-guy skin is obsessed with mother's milk and once internet fetish videos stop working for him, he snags a poor woman off the street. His second victim stands up to him (mostly) and like scolded child he starts to behave - in as much as a psychopath can...

If you love creepy films, Mother's Milk has a full fat liter here. But, sadly it's missing a real must-see vein. The leads are good - not great. Given better material, perhaps they'll shine. Casey Chapman, the villain here, is very much like a young James Spader. And Mackenzie Wiglesworth, the long-suffering captive, will no doubt show on a prime-time tv drama and sail into fame. Director Edward Pionke (and naturally writer) just needs to edit himself, cast a bit more realistically (the opening college room scene is like a stripclub's employee roster and acted as such), and learn the subtle difference between confusing his audience by adding a ""that would never happen - ever"" after a slug of celebratory whiskey, second ending to an already shot-badly crescendo. You're left with his, ""Let's put this in too and really freak people out."" The first thought was the correct one, speaking as a woman for all women everywhere - ever.",1419724800,7,1819,4.786624203821656
6729280,5,B00O8J0IWY,"So glad this movie is going to be released on DVD!!! I saw it at the New York City Independent Film Festival last year and loved it!! An engaging, dark, intimate piece presented by a strong director and equally strong actors.",1412899200,3,225,4.512195121951219
6729281,5,B00O8J0IWY,"I saw this film through the Southern California film festival and was pretty surprised. For a low budget movie, this was really quite impressive. It's a dark story about a man kidnapping a woman for some pretty unsettling reasons (hint - the title). However as time passes the two seem to form a connection that borderlines a love story. This all makes the film much more disturbing. It's an acting showcase and when I heard it was finally being released, I was pretty excited because I think people should see the film. It's probably not what you're expecting, but thats a good thing.",1412726400,3,585,4.689320388349515
6729282,5,B00O8J0IWY,"I saw this gem at the NYC Independent film festival last year. The two leads (Casey Chapman and Mackenzie Wiglesworth) give stellar performance each - well-deserving of the numerous awards they've received for this. Chapman's Claude walks a tight-rope of self-control, wavering just enough throughout to keep you holding your breath. Wiglesworth's delicate portrayal is so engaging that you not only root for her, you're pulled right into her reality. Pionke's lighting and cinematography (some single shots seemed to last for like 5 minutes, I swear) give the film the depth and pace it needs for his script to really resonate.

It's a boiling-pot-slow-burn thriller with a big payoff. Stockholm syndrome meets Oedipus complex. An ideal case study for any psychology buff and a buffet of treats for any film-lover (I just hope you enjoy liver). Highly recommended.",1412726400,10,865,5.268115942028985
6729283,5,B00O8J0IWY,"I saw this film on the festival circuit. Can you say.... CREEPY. Its very much a thriller. Great acting, twisted imagery... Perfect for Halloween.",1412726400,,146,5.125

6729286,1,B00O8J0IWY,"I'm sorry. I feel very bad about not being able to finish a film, spitting it out like some sort of spoiled child, but I just could tell there was nothing good to come. Mock me in ten years if this is recognized as some sort of cult classic, but I found it just embarrassing to watch. The lead actor, I don't even want to know his name, is so unconvincing as a psychopath, and the lines he's been given to read aren't helping any. Add to that the fact that the subject matter of this film is so intimate and the whole thing just feels sort of pervy and icky in a way that's just not doing anybody any good. At least that's the way I feel about it.",1427760000,,647,3.9846153846153847

6729288,2,B00O8J0IWY,"Good acting, good filmography, good directing......but the film just lacked substance.  It is listed as a thriller / drama, but not really.  It is kind of a psychological piece about an abduction, with a nut job as the abductor, and a very docile person as the abductee.  Don't let the title fool you, Mother's milk has very little time on breasts or lactating breasts.  The ending is just ...... lacking.  If the writers had spent more time on the script, making it more interesting, it might have been an actual good movie.  As it is, it is just lacking.",1427155200,7,556,4.565656565656566
6729289,4,B00O8J0IWY,Erotic to a degree but not enough breast milk extracting and her breasts didn't swell as the should've done even if it's visual effect that gives the illusion that she's lactating and there was actual milk being pumped out for crying out loud there should have been better breast milk scenes and it's not that hard to do keep the body and face the same woman but edit the breasts by showing them changing in growing as would happen in real life the fact that he didn't use a breast pump to help her out for his problem is something that could have been added to the film so please add more breast pumping and breast play with breasts growing weather naturally occurring or artificially as visual effects type of thing,1425772800,5,717,4.480916030534351

6729293,4,B00O8J0IWY,This Low cost Movie is quit dramatic and intense. It is not for the average movie goer you must be able to put yourself in the minds of the players and where they are coming from emotional. It will keep you on your seat and you must play cost attention to details as the move progress. The ending is surprising and worth the wait. Alfred Hitchcock would be prouder.,1422921600,4,365,4.304347826086956

8682561,5,B00O8J0IWY,"I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I watched it. Claude is a disturbing, yet collected man straining to control his murderous desires. A very refreshing take on a thriller in the vein of Psycho on many levels. Perfectly executed across the board on this feature. It could've taken the easy way out to shock but instead it took a much more interesting and refreshing take. Well done.",1493164800,,398,4.619718309859155

It's a little disturbing, actually.  Anyways, if you're into the captivity kind of stuff, this one might be for you.  It just wasn't for me.",1464393600,,308,4.62962962962963

8682565,5,B00O8J0IWY,"I found this film and decided to take a chance on it.  I'm glad I did.  The story is a chilling one of a girl abducted in broad daylight and held captive by a man with a disturbing past.  As the story unfolds, the viewer begins to understand why Claude is the way he is and, to a certain extent, even sympathize with him.  He is by no means a monster.  He treats his victim almost lovingly but the word love cannot be used with him.  His attraction to her is solely based on her ability to provide him with what he needs (hence the title).  As the film progresses, you feel as if these two people are bonding but this is not a situation that can last.  This is a beautifully filmed story that exceeded all expectations.  Casey Chapman and Mackenzie Wiglesworth both give outstanding performances.  Highly recommended!",1450569600,4,817,4.422818791946309
