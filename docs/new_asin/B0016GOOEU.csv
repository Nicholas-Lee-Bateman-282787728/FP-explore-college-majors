8262419,4,B0016GOOEU,"I have watched probably 100 Bollywood films in my life, but this one is strange. First the picture quality is poor and the songs are not subtitled. Aside from that it is meant as a quasi-social commentary, that one's environment causes criminal behavior. Sympathetically, the film tries to make a major criminal into a lovable guy. It's basically a gangster film with a few musical numbers and annoying silly slapstick comedy thrown in, along with improbable romance, pretty ridiculous plot and saintly forgiveness. This film tries to be too much.",1440547200,,547,5.088888888888889
8262420,5,B0016GOOEU,"Roti is a Manmohan Desai film. Before making movies with Amitabh,Manmohan Desai worked with Rajesh Khanna the Super Star- We wish they made more films as Roti would be one of the best movies of Manmohan Desai. It has excellent story, crisp direction, slick photography, solid dialogs, top performance and super hit music by Laxmikant Pyarelal. All songs are even hit today. Shot on locales in Kashmir, this is a story of Mangal Singh - a reformed criminal on the run. Rajesh Khanna has done the role excellently and is well supported by Mumtaz and the story line. Fellow artistes though do not have much to do but give good support. It is a must see for all Manmohan Desai and Rajesh Khanna fans.",1299974400,,696,4.620967741935484
