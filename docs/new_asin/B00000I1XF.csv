1218908,5,B00000I1XF,"My son loves this video, especially all the musical segments.  We recognized the ""Bat Song"" from the millenium edition but he doesn't care.  He likes pointing out the owls and bats.  It's after halloween and he still pulls that video out first!!",1036454400,2,245,4.785714285714286
1218909,5,B00000I1XF,"This is my sons favorite video. I was afraid that it might be a little scary considering he is only 20 months, but that is not the case and I am so happy I purchased it.",1029715200,,169,3.7222222222222223
1218910,4,B00000I1XF,Maybe too many clips that are in other videos...but a good introduction to the holiday for the under 2 crowd...My son was well prepared for costumes and pretending to be scary after watching this video for a few weeks before.,1009411200,5,225,4.65
1218911,5,B00000I1XF,"my son never knew who elmo was until I poped in this video, now he knows who elmo is and can even point him out in a toy store. Oh and I forgot to mention I just bought it 2 weeks ago.
My son is also just learning to count and with this video, and my help he can count to 10.
now when he wants to watch it he brings me the tape and says elmo, mom, elmo. I put it in give him a snack and don't hear him for a half hour.
I highly recomend this video too parents with hiper kids that just won't stay still. it will help them learn to concentrate as well as give you a break",1004400000,,570,3.6048387096774195
1218912,5,B00000I1XF,"I bought this video when my son was 18 months old, and out of all 20+ sesame street videos that we have, he wants to see this one over and over again. He loves the Count and Elmo together and laughs at the silly jokes. He also dances to the Count's singing. At 25 months old now, this video is still one of his favorites.",998611200,4,321,3.953846153846154
1218913,5,B00000I1XF,"My 2 yr old loves this video.  Although I don't find it scary (neither does she), I probably wouldn't show it to a child under 1.  I don't think they would get the idea of the video.  It's not meant to scare but to make light of irrational fears.
The songs are extremely catchy, my daughter and I find ourselves singing them all the time-""Transylvania 1-2-3"".  It also teaches kids about humor and jokes.  Definately a video to watch again and again.",988934400,4,450,4.439024390243903
1218914,5,B00000I1XF,"My 8 month old daughter has loved this video ever since she was 3 months old! This video is not only well made with the best sesame street songs, but has turned her into an Elmo fanatic.  This video and Baby Mozart and Baby Bach are still the only 3 videos that can keep her attention for the whole half hour.  A must have for any baby!",982886400,2,336,4.0
1218915,5,B00000I1XF,"My Daughter - now 2- is an Elmo fanatic. And while she was quite excited to see the new video, it has taken 3 viewings With Mommy close by to feel  comfortable with this video.
Between the friendly ghosts, the rattling  skeleton and the spooky organ, she was quite unsure - especially when she  saw Elmo jump or cry out with fright. She was also very skittish through  the Ernie and Bert in Egypt skit  - with the ""Ernie"" statue that  moved.
That is not to say that she now does not love this video - I just  want to caution parents that they may need to be close by to do some  explaining and reassuring as it can be a bit spooky. Unlike one like the  ""Best of Elmo"", I think this one needs a big lap to snuggle into  to enjoy!",967161600,14,728,4.027972027972028

Elmo and The Count are definitely her two favorite characters so I assumed this movie would be a hit, but it even surpassed my expectations. We watch this multiple times a day, and it is one of the few things that keeps my busy girl still for at least a little bit haha.

1218944,5,B00000I1XF,"My son really likes this video. At first he did not find any of it spooky, but now he slightly covers his eyes for the ghost. He did it for the skeleton too but I explained to him that the skeleton was just bones like the dogs chew and now he's cool with him and calls him 'Bones.' It is a short video with a lot of spooky jokes and a few song numbers, but it's a good 'spooky' toddler aged video for Halloween.",1412985600,,411,3.9047619047619047

1218952,5,B00000I1XF,The jokes are great. My three year old actually remembers some and repeats them. The songs are catchy. We watch this one at least once a week. It's also quite short as in around 30 minutes but the jokes keep coming and the little one is constantly entertained. Definitely recommended for every Sesame Street fan.,1378771200,,312,4.6909090909090905
1218953,5,B00000I1XF,This is a great video.  My son just loves it.  The tunes are very catchy and you may find yourself singing along with the characters.  We have this on VHS and we actually wore it out from the kids playing it so much.  I was glad to find it on DVD.  Your money will be well spent and you can't go wrong with Sesame Street shows.,1318896000,2,327,3.893939393939394
1218954,5,B00000I1XF,I loved this as a kid and I still watch it every Halloween.  My VHS copy that my parents recorded when I was little was starting to wear out so at age 21 I was delighted to find that a DVD version was available. When I was a kid I was afraid of a lot of things but not this. (The Garfield Halloween special on the same tape on the other hand freaked me out.)  I would recommend this to anyone with young kids for a nice Halloween treat. The Batty Bats are awesome.,1301270400,,464,3.925531914893617

1218957,5,B00000I1XF,I bought this DVD for my 2 year old nephew's birthday since he loves both Elmo and the Count.  My brother and sister-in-law tell me that he loves that DVD so much and some days watches it 3 or 4 times a day.  They say he likes to pretend he's scared with Elmo.,1228780800,,260,3.8867924528301887
1218968,5,B00000I1XF,"My two-year-old granddaughter loves Elmo, I love anything Halloween, we both love the Count, so this DVD was made for us! If you're looking for something fun and off the beaten Elmo path, then this is it! The story line is Elmo is going to visit the Count at his castle to share some ""scary"" jokes with him, and fun monster songs and ""old school"" songs by the Count are mixed in between. My granddaughter watched this everyday for a week (and then five times in a row when she was sick) when we first discovered it, and she still enjoys revisiting it. I must confess that I loved the songs so much that I bought one of the now discontinued CDs of the same title, and my granddaughter loves listening to the music when we drive around in the car (she always asks for ""more"" after each song ends ;). Believe me, once you see this DVD, you'll never stop singing the Count's ""bones, bones, bones"" song. (Please note: this DVD can get a little scary in places when the skeletons come out or some of the monsters growl. My granddaughter was scared the first time she saw them, but after we labeled them as ""scary,"" she likes them and will point out--with a smile--to me the ""scary"" moments when they come.)",1217116800,2,1200,4.385650224215246

1218971,4,B00000I1XF,"I like this halloween special, but I think the songs and story are better in Sesame Street Magical Halloween Adventure.

1218973,5,B00000I1XF,"I bought this video for my son 3 years ago when he was 2.  He played it so much I had to buy a new one for his little sister, because the DVD froze too much.  I even bought a 3rd one for my godson. My son now 5 still loves to watch it.  He knows all the words to the fun songs.  We dance and sing to every song on the DVD.  The DVD has funny Halloween jokes, catchy tunes, and of course Elmo is cute as ever when he tries to scare guest, Julia Roberts.  Its a great DVD the whole family can enjoy!

This DVD--compared to other Elmo DVD's--is a tad on the dark side, with a Haunted House and spooky sounds.  So while it is of course tame for us grown-ups, you may want to be careful if you think your child might be frightened.

I hope this helps you make your decision!",1160870400,2,481,4.288888888888889

1218994,4,B00000I1XF,"Many of the newer Sesame Street videos, particularly if they feature the ""little red menace"" are watered-down and icky sweet.  This one actually scared my toddler a little bit at the beginning - but engaged him enough to keep him watching until he wasn't scared any more - EXACTLY what you want it to do!
Toddlers have lots of fears - especially around halloween - and this video is a good way to show them that being scared can be fun!  It's filled with knock-knock jokes, bad puns, and spooky talking skeletons, ghosts, and more fun props.  I love that they didn't get rid of the thunder, lightning, or any other ""scary"" stuff in the Count's castle.  There's also a lot of muppet-kid interaction where everyone gets silly.
I highly recommend this video to anyone who's got a shy toddler!",1045267200,17,789,4.614285714285714

Like with all the Elmo videos she is all eyes for ELMO and rarely moves an inch when watching him...except for when Julia Roberts comes on and Elmo tries to scare her....very odd...but she got upset every time that part would come on....(Also in the best of elmo with the same part).  My husband and I would make sure to laugh and clap during that part...so she is comfortable with it now...But otherwise this movie is a perfect Halloween video to add to the collection!,1041206400,2,598,4.632075471698113

Her favorite tapes/dvds are The Best of Elmo, Elmo Says Boo, and Kids Favorite Songs II in the Sesame Street/Elmo series.  She gets bored with Elmo's World series as it gets a little too serious for her and she seems to get bored.  This tape is great and she doesn't seem to get scared at all.  Maybe that will come later, but I don't see how a kid could really get scared at this tape.  It's a stitch to me, but I'm not 2 either.",1036713600,10,630,4.008
