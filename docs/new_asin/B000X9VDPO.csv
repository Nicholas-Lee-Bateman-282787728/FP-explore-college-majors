8227464,5,B000X9VDPO,"The now defunct Oasis Hong Kong airlines flew beautiful 747-400's across Asia and Europe from Hong Kong to London. (Last I looked, Boeing was listing the exact aircraft we fly on this video for sale on its web site, if you have $40 million or so).

This video is most remarkable because it contains air to air footage.  The cameraman is in a small Cessna type aircraft, and shoots video of the 747 from the air.  This is the only video I am aware of that has this type of footage.

We get an excellent flight crew who explain procedure and instrumentation with a skill and completeness missing in many other videos.  They do a great job explaining, and then a great job flying.  The China and Russia overflights are interesting in the use of metric altitudes, lack of radar coverage, and high terrain, which makes the flight more interesting.

All in all, another excellent DVD.",1332201600,,878,4.589743589743589
8227465,5,B000X9VDPO,"This detailed DVD is a MUST HAVE for all aviation fans out there on earth. The DVD begins off with the company's facility walkthrough (finance department, meeting room, staff lounge, etc.) followed by flight operations and finally a word from the chief himself explainning the history of Oasis airlines and how it works. The Airline itself offers economy and business class cabins. After finishing from the company's walkthrough you get to see a tour of hong kong followed by preflight presentations until we finally ride the aircraft and see how the flight crew get prepared before take off. Pilot's accent is very good that you can understand what they are talking about, explainning everything in a coherent way. As I mentioned before this is a MUST HAVE for everyone who's into aviation. It is running out-of-stock so hurry up, grab your cash, and get your rare copy now.",1216252800,,875,4.918918918918919
8227466,5,B000X9VDPO,"Based on the reviews and my desire to learn more about the 747 I ordered this video.

I won't reiterate the other reviewers but will only add that the cockpit presentation aspect and flight deck operations of this video are EXTREMELY detailed and given directly by the Captain and First Officer.  EVERY panel is explained in full.

This must be half the DVD in my estimation (which is great IMO lol)

There are no actors, everyone is the real deal and there are no talking heads in the background (who you want to shoot just to shut them up)

one caveat:  the video quality itself is not Discovery Channel quality, more like good camcorder quality.  Fortunately the cameraman is quite good and not one of these over excited gooney bird handshakers (ala youtube)",1211760000,3,761,4.676691729323308
8227467,5,B000X9VDPO,"This DVD and others in the series would make a great collection for any aviation enthusiast. Not only does the camera give the feeling of a very educational documentary, but provides the viewer a cockpit view from the pilot's perspective. The film is of very high quality, although it is not like the one's used in Hollywood movies. Nevertheless, the camera crew does an excellent job of getting the best angle inside the cockpit during the different phases of flight, with no shaking or jerky movements like those in amateur films. The pictures are crisp, clear, and provide every single detail inside a Boeing 747-400 cockpit. Very professionally done!!! The -400 series of Boeing 747s use the upgraded instrument panel which contain PFDs (Primary Flight Displays) and MFDs (Multi-Function Displays). These are the computer screens you see in the cockpit surrounded by many dials and switches. Throughout the film, the crew explains many of the instruments and what they are used for. These discussions range from the pilot telling the viewer how one can train (to be a pilot) to the co-pilot explaining what the overhead yaw damper switches are used for.

I have seen other aviation DVDs, like those from AirUtopia. Their airport dvds contain fascinating airplanes with different paint schemes, but can only provide so much entertainment. Seeing constant take-offs and landings can get boring after a while. While not fast-paced like a movie, this Oasis Hong Kong dvd is a step above watching constant take-offs and landings. It's more educational (with the crews discussions/explanations), informative (you get an overview of the operational aspects of an airline company), and exciting to watch (pilot's view of take-offs, landings, and beautiful in-flight scenery in the air & ground).",1199664000,5,1791,5.21875
8227468,5,B000X9VDPO,"I am addicted to Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and have been a fan since the very first version.

I recently added the PMDG B747-400 and its associated FS2Crew add-on, giving me realism in flight simulation never before attained on a PC. The PMDG B747-400 simulation is so complicated that one has to read the Pilot Operating Handbook to understand its systems and program the FMC.

I purchased this DVD to help me in understanding better how the 747-400 is flown and operated so I can simulate its operation on my simulator. I was really amazed at how similar the simulator is to the real B747-400.

This DVD starts off in the headquarters of Oasis Hong Kong at HKG. We are introduced to their staff and operation. According to the Flight operation Director, Oasis has the most qualified pilots on the 747-400 in the world! All their pilots have at least 10 years experience on the B747-400.

Oasis uses 32 pilots for each of its B747-400. All their flights are long haul, with Hong Kong (HKG) to Gatwick (LGW) and back to Hong Kong on a daily bases. They recently introduced a daily service from Hong Kong to Vancouver. These long haul flights are about 12 hours in flight time. Usually there are 4 pilots on each flight. Two pilots fly the first 5 hours of the flight; they then retire to the bunkers to sleep while the other two pilots, who were previously resting, take over. When about an hour and a half of flight time is remaining, they are replaced by the original two pilots, who are now well rested. So the same two pilots perform the takeoff and then the landing. I find this procedure quite interesting.

This DVD will show you first the flight from Hong Kong to London, filmed entirely in the cockpit from cockpit pre-flight, pushback, taxi, and takeoff, to the landing and arrival at the gate in Gatwick. The DVD will then show the flight back to Hong Kong, but on this leg back, the film will start in the cockpit at cruise over Moscow, and will continue to the approach and landing at Hong Kong.

You will witness all the procedures and checklists the pilots go through in all phases of flight. Of interest is their continuous monitoring of emergency landing airstrips throughout their route, and escape routes in high terrain should an engine fail.

It was amazing when near Moscow they cross another Oasis aircraft in the opposite direction en-route to London. The other aircraft flashes its lights, just like truckers do when they meet on the road. It was really interesting and fascinating to watch.

I did have trouble playing this DVD on one of my DVD players. For some reason it couldn't read it. However, it played fine on a second DVD player I have, albeit it hung three times throughout the movie.

This is not a Hollywood production, and the filming is not very professional. It looks like an amateurish film, but it does convey its intent: showing us how a B747-400 is operated.

Because of this 200 minutes DVD, I can now enjoy flying the PMDG B747-400 on Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The operation is amazingly identical.",1199491200,7,3053,4.647495361781076
