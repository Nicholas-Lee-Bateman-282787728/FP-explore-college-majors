331869,2,6301514025,"""Charly"" is unfairly dramatized. Now, I undestand that the original is subtle and challenging stuff to film, but excuses do not make a good movie. When I go to see a film version of Keyes' masterpiece ""Flowers for Algernon,"" I'm not really expecting a ludicrous romance armed with several barbs directed at intellectualism and pop-culture.
""Flowers for Algernon"" was about a mentally challenged man's exponential mental development after a surgical procedure, followed by his tragic decline. ""Charly"" is about a mentally challenged man's transformation into a suit-and-tie kinda guy, at which point his libido awakens and he strikes up an absurd relationship with his tutor. Then we get a minute's worth of footage of Charly growing forgetful and irritable, and then - bam! - he is again frolicking around with an IQ of 68, happy as a clam. Not only does this film provide us with a happy ending - it's the WRONG happy ending: read the book and you'll find a much better one at the end.
Of course, ""Charly"" isn't entirely bad. It just seems that way. Cliff Robertson's outstanding performance as the title character buoys the score a little. It also allow him to keep a straight face during an unintentionally comical scene in which a panel of scientists ask him existential questions and he gives snappy answers (""Standard of living?"" ""A TV in every room."" ""Education?"" ""A TV IN EVERY ROOM!"") The scenes in which Charly goes through biker and disco dancer phases are also hilarious.
Seriously, though, the entire film creates an impression of wrongness and inappropriacy. Charly acts in realistic, sufficiently childlike ways, but the viewer never gains insight into his inner workings. The film is a character study narrated by minor and totally undeveloped characters. ""Charly"" also suffers from exceptional heavy-handedness. The scene is which Charly gropes Ms. Kinnian and she scrambles away from him, screaming ""who could want you, you stupid moron!?"" is a prime example. Another is his relationship with his co-workers. In the book they just joked about him. Here, they are genuinely malicious.
People who've read the literary work before seeing the film based on it are usually biased against the film. I am definitely a part of that crowd, so your opinion may be vastly different from mine. Nonethelss, the writer and director should have taken a hint when they had to resort to soap-opera contrivances to interest the viewer.",1002585600,5,2435,5.059701492537314
331870,3,6301514025,"This is a somewhat disappointing adaptation of the wonderful book, ""Flowers for Algernon"", by Daniel Keyes. This is not to say that Cliff Robertson's performance in the title role of Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged person, is not Oscar worthy. It is, and he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Charly Gordon. Claire Bloom is also noteworthy for her performance as Charly's teacher and love interest, Alice Kinian. The problem with this film lies in the screenplay and direction of the film.
The storyline is simple enough. Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged soul with a thirst for knowledge, attends night school in an effort to get smart. His teacher is Alice Kinian, a sensitive and caring person, who recognizes Charly's determination, as well as his limitations. She takes an interest in him and refers him to an institute that has been doing research in increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice through neurosurgery and is now on the cusp of attempting that experimental neorosurgery on humans. The institute is in the process of selecting candidates for its clinical trials.
Charly goes to the institute where he undergoes a battery of tests and has his capability for problem solving compared to that of a laboratory mouse named Algernon, whose intelligence has been surgically enhanced. After much deliberation, the institute decides to take Charly on as a human guinea pig, after Ms. Kinian eloquently persuades them that Charly's determination and sweet disposition should overcome the fact that he is below the threshold level of intelligence that they were looking for in a human subject.
Charly undergoes the neurosurgery which initially appears to be a success. He gets smart, very smart. The inevitable romance with Ms. Kinian follows, as Charly exceeds all expectations. It is here that the film begins to fall apart and takes a swan dive. In an effort to show the changes in Charly's life, the film shows a collage of stills and scenes of Charly and Ms. Kinian that are ludicrous and almost embarrassing. They are presented in a fashion that is best described as psychedelic. It is done so poorly, as to make the film lose credibility, and it is downhill from there on, as the story becomes one dimensional. The screenplay writer and director should have stuck to the book, both in story and in theme, remembering that you can't fix what ain't broke.
Still, Cliff Robertson's performance, as well as that of Claire Bloom, is worth watching. If you have already read the book, however, prepare to be disappointed. If you have not read the book, as yet, watch the movie first, and then read the book.",999907200,46,2669,4.973154362416107
331871,4,6301514025,"I just finished reading Flowers For Algernon, and it is an outstanding literary work.  Then I watched this movie.
104 minutes of film cannot do justice to a 216 page masterpiece.  Cliff Robertson deserved the Oscar he won for this movie.  He is at his very best in this picture.  I wish they had used a little more tape to draw a broader picture of his character, and spent more time concentrating on his regression.  The infamous motorcycle scenes were strangely out of place, and this short segment could have been expanded upon by focusing a little more time and creativity on his emotional development.
When the comparison to the book is eliminated from the equation, this movie stands well on its own.",969926400,3,706,4.7073170731707314

331873,4,6301514025,"The video ""Charly"" is a good example of human determination and love. Cliff Robertson does one of his most brilliant performances in his career.  Don't forget his co-star Claire Bloom[Miss Kinnian] she played well off of Mr. Robertson. The only real part of the movie that will make  you say ""what the devil is this?"" is the part where Charly runs  away on a motorcycle and has a 3 minute psycodelic episode. In the episode  he ""grows up"" as mentioned in the book. But I don't recall a part  where Charly gets on a bike and turns wild in the book. That would have  been something if that was in the book. And what was the deal with Miss  Kinnian's hair? It was huge, if I didn't know any better I'd call it a  Boffaunt! I hope this review made at least someone laugh. Buy The Movie And  The Book! They Rock!",954288000,5,807,4.256578947368421
331874,5,6301514025,"Charly is a movie about a man who is a mentally challenged named Charlie (Cliff Robertson) who is given the opportunity to triple his intelligence by a newly introduced surgery. Charlie has the desire to be a normal  person, so he is the perfect subject for the experiment.  This movie is  highly recommended for those who have ever read the short story ""Flowers  for Algernon"" the short story that it is based on. Charly, It has good  music performed to keep the story moving, and is rated PG (parental  guidance) because of the lack of violence and profanity.  Charly was a  movie of hope, dreams, love, comedy, success, and tragedy. Cliff  Robertson's performance is outstanding, much like Tom Hank's performance in  Forest Gump. Robertson portrayed a both retarded, and a Genius very, very  well. The co-star who played Ms. Kinnian also performed well acting out the  part of Charlie's teacher and friend throughout the movie.  Charly is a  great movie that should defiantly not be overlooked, especially for science  fiction and romance lovers.",949536000,,1049,4.982658959537572
331875,1,6301514025,"I am a great fan of Keyes' work, and one of my favorite books was Flowers for Algernon, which this movie is based off of. Well, I was very excited to be able to see this book put into life on the screeen, only to be terribly  dissapointed.  I'm rating this movie by the book it was compared to, and in  relation to ""Flower's for Algeernon"" this movie was terrible.  The movie totally left out half of the book, and made a disgrace of what  they put into it.  I also felt Cliff Roberstson portrayed Charly poorly.  Three of the main Characters were totally left out of the movie, which  affected what little of a plot they had left.  They also altered the ending  from the books.  Overall I feel claiming this movie was based on  ""Flowers for Algernon"" is an insult to the book.  So, my advice,  buy the book, burn the movie.",948067200,,824,4.266233766233766
331876,5,6301514025,"True, this movie may be outdated in relation to the 90's era of science and technology, but it still remains one of those few films which produce an inner desire for learning and love.  Robertson and his co-stars provide  a great acting performance.  The director did a fine job in taking the  book, ""Flowers for Algernon"", and making it actually better when  seen on film.  This movie really hits the heart as few do.  It also sets  off a catalyst of desire for educational achievement. Spielburg and Tom  Hanks could put together a brilliant remake of this today.  Buy this movie.  It is one of the best.",940204800,16,606,4.570093457943925
331990,3,6301514025,"It just so happened the first time I saw this movie on t.v.  I was a freshman in high school and we were reading Flowers For Algernon.  Which was why I watched it.  I probably wouldn't have watched it other wise.  The subject matter is not really the kind of thing I am too interested in.  But I am glad I watched it.  It is a very good movie.  Cliff Robertson won best actor for this.  The story is about a man who is mentally challenged, has an operation that makes him a genius.  Only to find out the effects are temporary.  When he is on stage and gives his speech  when he finds out that the effects won't last.  And the very last scene in the movie will stay with you long after the movie is over.",1483142400,,703,4.0144927536231885
331991,3,6301514025,"I bought this on DVD because I couldn't find this movie digitally anywhere and my fiance had just finished reading Flowers for Algernon and was wanting to see one of the movies.  I saw that Cliff Robertson had won an Oscar for his role in this film so I assumed that this one must be the superior of the Algernon films.  While this may still be true, we weren't impressed with this one.  It wasn't necessarily a bad film, but if you have read the book then many things have changed.  Even if you haven't read the book there is a group of scenes about a little over half way through the movie that don't make any sense whatsoever.  Why they decided to film and release the motorcycle scene as a part of Charly I will not understand.  When this scene played, my fiance and I looked at one another asking if the movie had somehow changed.  It was like an entirely different movie with an entirely different director.  It was as if the director had fallen ill and assigned the scene to the assistant director who then decided to throw out the script and film a weird music video vaguely inspired by the rest of the scenes that they filmed, the real director looked it over, shrugged, and continued on from there.  It made no sense.  It really pulled both of us out of the movie and we never could get back into it for the rest of the movie, our minds forever tainted with the weird motorcycle scene.  Otherwise the movie may have been just okay.  2.5 Stars.",1477872000,,1453,4.340740740740741

If the message from your emotions speaks to you louder than that from your intellect what does THAT say about Charly?

332095,5,6301514025,"Daniel Keyes created a timeless classic that stirs the heart and mind, and Cliff Robertson made it come to life on screen. I loved the story, book, and movie back in the 1960s and I love them now. Mary Shelley established the concept of science run-amok long before Keyes, but her Frankenstein monster is usually mistaken for the creature, not its creator. Keyes establishes a clearer line: his hero is just that, and his doctors not megalomaniacs, but people who accept the idea that because science can do something, it should. And that seems true, especially when the work is so benign, so kind; especially when a nice, 68 IQ man can be transformed.

Other questions for science emerge: what is informed consent, and what does it matter, if informed consent itself is only possible after the actual experiment makes the subject capable of giving it? The questions are many, and yet the film is not preachy or pedantic. Rather, I love Charly (Charlie in the Keyes' work) and I root for him, even as I know he is in an impossible, hopeless situation, and he comes to know it. The mouse, Algernon, becomes a touchstone that both Charly and I learn to love, as well. Charly's victory is in becoming, and his tragedy is that becoming transforms him through loss of innocence. Just as a child sees love in every face, until he doesn't, Charly's unequivocal trust in human kindness, tried and tested, becomes an unforeseen consequence of the experiment.",1397692800,3,1449,4.772908366533865

Why'd they have to put that whole bit in? I mean, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that a mentally retarded person would still be fully developed physically.

Back in the 1950's and 1960's, in the days before dyslexia, ADHD, or Aspergers' Syndrome were understood, many of us were thought to be stupid or lazy while in elementary school--only to excel in high school and college where the curriculum demanded a degree of abstract and spatial thinking, rather than consisting entirely of the mundane clerical work that dominated elementary school.

I first saw this movie in 1968, when I was a sophomore or junior in high school and found it to be shockingly surreal!  I still recall the feeling of shaking in my seat and breaking out into a cold sweat--its impact on me was that great!  So many of poor Charly's struggles seemed strangely parallel to my own.

In ninth grade, I once even overheard one of my classmates wondering out loud how I had come to be a ""brain "" over the course of eighth and ninth grades!

332345,4,6301514025,"The hopelessly dated film ""Charly"" a product of the psychedelic 60's based on the book ""Flowers for Algernon"" revolves around an mentally challenged adult Charly Gordon played by Cliff Robertson.  Charly lives a lonely solitary existence working as a laborer in a bakery, often the brunt of practical jokes at the hand of his more ""cerebral"" colleagues.  Despite his handicap he tries to better himself by attending night school where he is tutored by Mrs. Kinian played Claire Bloom.

Bloom playing a Phd. psychology candidate nominates Charly for a revolutionary experiment conducted by neuroscientists Drs. Straus and Nemur played respectively by Lilia Skala and Leon Janney.  They had amazing success implanting brain tissue into a white mouse named Algernon significantly increasing his intelligence.  They were now ready to attempt this procedure on a human subject and Charly was to be their guinea pig.

With Bloom as his teacher, Robertson's mental capabilities grew to genius level as he began digesting quantum amounts of information.  His emotional development however did not grow at the same pace.  Eventually he and Bloom fell in love, as his amazing tranformation is about to be demonstrated before the scientific community.  At the conference, Robertson learns that the results of the operation are only temporary and he desperately tries to use his new found intelligence to prevent his life from reverting back.

332348,4,6301514025,"Charly is a very moving movie from 1968 that gave star Cliff Robertson his first and only Oscar win, a well deserved nomination at that.  Charly Gordon is a mentally disabled man with an IQ of 70.  He lives in a single room that he rents with basically nothing more than a bed, a table, and a chalkboard where he writes his things to do for the next day. Charly works at a bakery where the people he thinks are his friends, his co-workers, always make fun of him and play practical jokes.  But he doesn't let much stop him, going to night school everyday for 2 years to learn to read and write.  Then, a doctor with a new procedure comes along and offers Charly the chance to become smart.  Charly undergoes the procedure and almost overnight becomes a new man, in just a few weeks he is a genius.  But everything is not quite what it seems as Charly begins to experience life all over again and see what the world is really like.  This was a very powerful movie from beginning to end. It could almost be divided into two separate movies and still been very good.  As a viewer, you come to really know Charly, which makes the ending, especially the final shot, that much more moving.  Definitely give this movie a try.

  In the performance that won him his lone Academy Award, Cliff Robertson stars as Charly Gordon, the mentally disabled middle aged man who has his life change drastically in the matter of days.  Robertson is really playing two roles here, pre-surgery Charly and post-surgery Charly.  Always a very strong actor throughout his career, Robertson pulls off both parts beautifully and really makes you feel with and for the character.  Claire Bloom plays Alice Kinian, Charly's teacher who becomes much more than his teacher as Charly goes through the transformation following the surgery.  Bloom is very good next to Robertson.  Lilia Skala plays Dr. Anna Straus, one of the doctors who works with Charly and ultimately, has his best interest at heart.  Leon Janney plays Straus' opposite, Dr. Richard Nemur, who seems to only be interested in how famous he will become.  The movie also stars Ruth White, Dick Van Patten, Ed McNally, Barney Martin, William Dwyer, and Dan Morgan.

332352,3,6301514025,"Charly (Ralph Nelson, 1968)

Any list of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters would have to include Stirling Silliphant. Village of the Damned. Nightfall. In the Heat of the Night. Telefon. The Towering Inferno. But, like most screenwriters, every once in a while, he got it wrong. The Poseidon Adventure. The Swarm. Over the Top. Yes, Over the Top, the infamous Sylvester Stallone arm wrestling movie. That was him. Where Charly falls onto this line probably depends on how you feel about the novel.

Loosely based on Daniel Keyes' classic Flowers for Algernon, Charly is the story of Charlie Gordon, a mentally retarded man who undergoes an experimental brain operation that makes him smart, and the trials and tribulations that come from getting everything you wish for. I tried to look at Charly as being an entirely separate beast from the novel, but I'm not sure that's the way to go with this one. Whether I look at it in comparison or not, the movie still suffers.

Compared to the novel, the difference is that Charlie Gordon (Cliff Robertson, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance) himself is an emasculated character, a passive observer of events, where the novel's Charlie was active, a participant in things. Many of the novel's subplots that made Charlie into a man of action have been removed; he's no longer the inquisitive scientist who discovers the seeds of his own downfall, but someone who's asked to help stop that downfall after it's revealed to him. His parents are gone; the complex relationship he has with his teacher Alice (here played by The Haunting's Claire Bloom) is turned into a simple, if slightly confusing, love story. (Confusing because there's a fiance mentioned who pops up nowhere in the book; he disappears again as soon as it's convenient, getting no actual screen time.) I understand that even a slim novel has to be trimmed to fit into movie form, but other things were added that brought nothing of comparable (or measurable) value to the table. Which leads me to the other option.

Taken on its own, it's an intriguing beginning that goes horribly, horribly wrong about two-thirds of the way through, when it stops being a story about a guy in an interesting situation and becomes a one-dimensional piece of political screed barely worthy of existence. (I kept thinking about Slaughterhouse-Five during the awful Q&A scene.) It does improve again after that, but that scene, sitting in the conceptual center of the film with no anchor, and indeed no reason for being there (it's a pivotal scene in the novel, though it plays out in a much different manner), is claptrap of the most nauseating kind.

I know part of my reaction to the movie is my own fault. I usually stick to my rule about not seeing a film adaptation until at least a year after I read the associated book. That said, Flowers for Algernon was such an amazing book, I wanted to see the movie ASAP. Well, the saying ""the bigger they are..."" applies here, most definitely. It wouldn't be an awful film, without the inclusion of that one horribly offensive scene. That, however, drags the whole thing down. ** ",1184716800,5,3128,4.837383177570094

332422,3,6301514025,"Unliike many reviewers, I saw this movie when first released before I read the book. Like many movies of its period this one has a distinct 60s flavor to it in many respects. Like movies from the 70s, many of the production qualities of this movie's time seem incredibly dated. But hindsight can put that kind of stamp on any time period (anyone ever watched an episode of ""Miami Vice"" in hindsight with a straight face?). So just when one saw ""Charly"" for the first time makes all the difference, as does which they did first- read the book or saw the movie. The impact it had on me when I first saw it was tremendous. I wanted to see it again but before that occurred I read the book. I probably enjoyed the book much more as a result. I agree that the two have dramatic differences, but that has always been the risk when adapting a movie from the book. Robertson gives a solid, award winnng performance that evokes pathos, though today it seems a bit over the top. The direction and camera work are reflective of the late 60s, which unwittingly seems to make this movie that much more of a time capsule, almost worth watching for that reason alone- almost! But that detracts from the film at hand. One could argue that if this movie was produced in a different decade it might still bear trademarks indigenousness to that time and place. When younger I demanded films that suited my taste buds of the age I was at that time. Since then, over the years I've watched lots of movies from different time periods that I either hadn't seen before, or now viewed differently. But generally that didn't take away from the appreciation originally instilled in me for a movie. I still find many scenes in this movie heartbreaking, particularly the sequence in which intelligent Charlie can't escape the vision of what inevitably awaits him once the experiment wears off. Just how that was accomplished by the film is irrelevant. Some movies demand remakes. Others are remade merely to add contemporary flavor in some shape or form and should never have been remade. In between those two there is a wide gap of grey, which is where I feel this movie falls. There are numerous films that don't find a contemporary audience due to the time it was released. I still know many who either haven't seen ""Rosemary's Baby"" or couldn't make it through it because they could taste the 60s while watching it. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a great film. Not to compare the two films directly, but it can be argued that ""Charlie"" suffers in the same manner. Though great movies withstand the test of time, to me, how much you enjoy ""Charly"" is purely subjective. How will good films from today look 20-30 years from now?",1180742400,,2702,4.5731958762886595

Director Ralph Nelson plays up this romantic element using all the cinematic clichs of the late 60s - falling leaves, pastel colors, soft music - perhaps new and different at the time, but pretty hard to take today. Worse is that Nelson's attention is drawn away from the real point of the story - the results of the experiment and what it says about the way we view each other, though the best scene in the movie is where Robertson lectures a roomful of doctors about their arrogance as he holds the dead mouse Algernon in his hand, a victim of the experiment - as Robertson will shortly become as well.

A mildly mentally retarded man submits to a scientific experiment to increase his intelligence. Like ""Frankenstein"", ""Charly"" is a clever morality play about science that crosses certain boundaries. Unlike ""Frankenstein"", which took the horror route, ""Charly"" explores the emotional human tragedy that inevitably occurs when an experiment of this nature goes awry.

Many scientists back then and even today argue that the professional boundaries that were crossed in this story would never happen in real life. Yet with the recent successful gene manipulation and cloning experiments many believe it is only a matter of time, a very short time, before a human submits to such experiments.

What I got most from this film is not a clinical study of mental retardation but the way society deals with mental retardation, and in this the film soars, and it will bring a tear or two if you have even a bit of humanity. It is a wonderful film, on many levels, testing us all on how we deal with those who are so unfortunate as to be mentally handicapped.

The book on which the movie is based, Flowers for Algernon, is a true classic of science fiction and a really memorable book.  The movie scriptwriters chose to focus on the relationship between Charlie Gordon and his teacher, and spent less time on the nature of Charlie's intellectual development and what it meant to his life.  The book is actually based on an earlier novella that Daniel Keyes wrote that won the Hugo Award.  I have always felt that the expansion into novel length did not add anything to the story development and in fact blunted the powerful effect of the novella's roller coaster ride.

In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.  I would recommend the book even more strongly.",1152057600,2,1353,4.839130434782609
332471,3,6301514025,"""Charly,"" a relatively loose adaptation of Daniel Keyes' critically-acclaimed novella Flowers for Algernon, is a 1968 movie that showcases much of that decade's tendency toward the psychadellic and the beatnik, however in doing so it makes several perhaps fatal departures from the book.

I say ""fatal"" not in the sense that the movie is terrible, because the movie is quite good though slow in places, but fatal in the sense that some important, fundamental elements present in the book are missing from the movie version. This was probably the intent of the director to make the movie more accessible to large audiences, and is evident in that he changed the title of the book to ""Charly"" for the movie. Some of the more blatant directoral liberties include:

- The relationship between Charlie and Miss Kinnian is depicted as rather wilde and tawdry in the film (with several semi-explicit scenes), where as in the book, Charlie simply develops a romantic fixation on her that is never consumated. Although the director probably felt the need to incorporate a love interest in the movie to keep viewers watching, it seemed rather unnecessary and the low-key approach of the book might have actually been more interesting.

- Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur are a female and a male neurologist respectively in the movie, where as in the novel both are men. While seemingly a minor discrepancy, the book implied that there was a clashing of male egos, especially as the novel showcased Dr. Nemur as feeling pressure and jealousy so as to get more credit for the experiment than Dr. Strauss, a younger man with certain fundamental differences of opinion regarding the whole procedure.

- In the movie Charlie briefly joins -- in an utterly preposterous scene -- a motorcycle gang and engages in an orgy with the female bikers, as solace for his rejection by Miss Kinnian. While this was entertaining on an ""oh my, this really is so dumb it's fascinating and fun to watch"" level, nothing of the sort occurred in the book, and there are probably better ways to show Charlie's difficulty in adjusting to life as an intellectual genius albeit with the hormonal instability of a sixteen year old.

While ""Charly"" is still an enjoyable movie, it is a bit boring if you haven't read the book first, and, considering the superior quality of the book's story, the movie seems actually worse than it really is.",1149638400,5,2394,4.872235872235872
332472,5,6301514025,"The message of Charly (based on the David Keyes short story and novel, ""Flowers for Algernon,"" remains as powerful and poignant today as it was in 1968 when Cliff Robertson brought the story of Charlie Gordon to television. American don't treat the mentally handicapped well. Theirs a struggle marked too often by social stigmatism that marginalizes their existence. People don't like to see those who are obviously mentally handicapped or ill. Perhaps their conditions remind us of our frailties.

Starring Cliff Robertson (who was also responsible for the made-for-tv film's production) and Claire Bloom, the film tells the story of a 38-year-old retarded man who is given one chance at normalcy. For a few brilliant months he becomes a genius through the agency of a flawed operation by a scientist whose ethics are weak. The true horror of the film is realized when Charles Gordon is able to clearly see his own approaching demise and the inevitable return to his former retardation.

Both short story and script question many aspects of America's dependence on a technology that outstrips our ability to lay an ethical foundation for its use. We forget that innocent people are hurt in our rush to scientific acclaim.

As a teacher, I was overwhelmed by the response of my middle school students to both the short story and the film. They understood the inherent dangers in what they read and viewed. For any teacher, I recommend the film and urge that it be accompanied by a study of the short story or novel on which it is based.",1140998400,8,1536,4.8773946360153255

332477,4,6301514025,"Taken from the book Flowers for Algernon, the movie ""Charly"" is of course not going to be an exact retelling of the book, as no movie is.  Since the book was written in the fifties and the movie made in the sixties, the movie puts a certain spin on it that could only have been used in the sixties, with split-screens, running down endless hallways, and even a neon ""LOVE"" sign at one point.  This may take a little away from the book's message.  The movie also fails to deal with Charlie's sexual problems, making his romance with Alice Kinnian, which did happen in the book, an instant story of too-mushy true love, rather than the book's description of Charlie's tortured longing for a real relationship while he remains emotionally a child, even as a genius.  Alice mentions something in the movie about not being able to keep up with Charlie's intellect, which is much more of a conflict in the book.  In this change they also eliminate the entire conflict with Charlie's family, especially his mother, which was quite vital to the storyline in the book.  The movie, when not compared with the book, is melodramatic and the transitions from retardate to genius and back again are shown poorly, with little of the emotional perspective that could have been very exciting.  However, Robertson's Oscar was not undeserved, as he manages to play Charlie well with both too low and too high an IQ, and shows his indignance well when Charlie realizes those he thought were friends treated him as less than human while he laughed along.  I think the first part of the movie, where Charlie struggles to be accepted for the experiment, is more heartwarming than the rest of it up to the very end.  The scientific convention is handled vaguely and shortly.  However, all in all, I think that without my frustration at its difference from the novel, it would have been averagely entertaining, with some high points.",1109980800,6,1908,4.737160120845921

His way of portraying a ""retardate"" (their word) was by playing on the playground with little children, tongue hanging out, wearing flood pants and a goofy smile. Nowhere in the book did he play on a playground except in his memories of childhood. When he became smart, his clothes fit. When he reverted, suddenly his pants were too short again. Huge details were changed, and not for the better. And the 60's cinematography was God-awful! (And why did everyone have that fakey pseudo-English accent? Did actors in the 60's have to learn that?

332505,4,6301514025,"This movie was based on the book called `Flowers for Algernon'.  You can look at the synopsis above, and that will save me from boring you with the details.
I will say this:  I thought that the split screens were wonderful. Yes, the way that the period that was supposed to be Charly's adolescence and young adult phase was portrayed *was* a bit hokey, but what does one expect when viewing a movie made so long ago?  It is a bit campy, but no matter. Personally, I thought that the split screen presentation of that period was refreshing after the 80's and 90's choreography I'd seen(I saw Charly first in '95).
I am not a typical female that gets all sappy during all `chick flix', and I enjoy many movies that are considered `guy films' (Quentin Tarantino, anyone?).
It could be said that the sixties were a more innocent time, or it could be said that these folk (both the author of `Flowers for Algernon' and the makers of `Charly') had little *truly significant* experience in personal relationships (i.e. close friendships) with retarded people.  Whichever you choose, it goes without saying for those of us who do not lack such experience-that retarded people mature sexually, just as the rest of us do.  It may take them a little while longer, but it is very probable that Charly would have had knowledge of at least one woman by the time he was 30 years old.
Aside from that, the film-in my opinion-is a wonderful story of a fragile, yet moral and responsible human being.  Perhaps not as good as the book, but movies seldom are.
Charly was a disappointment to many when held up to the book, but by itself it's beautiful.  Worth a rent, if not a buy, but I am going to buy it regardless.

332570,3,6301514025,"This is a somewhat disappointing adaptation of the wonderful book, ""Flowers for Algernon"", by Daniel Keyes. This is not to say that Cliff Robertson's performance in the title role of Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged person, is not Oscar worthy. It is, and he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Charly Gordon. Claire Bloom is also noteworthy for her performance as Charly's teacher and love interest, Alice Kinian. The problem with this film lies in the screenplay and direction of the film.

The storyline is simple enough. Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged soul with a thirst for knowledge, attends night school in an effort to get smart. His teacher is Alice Kinian, a sensitive and caring person, who recognizes Charly's determination, as well as his limitations. She takes an interest in him and refers him to an institute that has been doing research in increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice through neurosurgery and is now on the cusp of attempting that experimental neurosurgery on humans. The institute is in the process of selecting candidates for its clinical trials.

Charly goes to the institute where he undergoes a battery of tests and has his capability for problem solving compared to that of a laboratory mouse named Algernon, whose intelligence has been surgically enhanced. After much deliberation, the institute decides to take Charly on as a human guinea pig, after Ms. Kinian eloquently persuades them that Charly's determination and sweet disposition should overcome the fact that he is below the threshold level of intelligence that they were looking for in a human subject.

Charly undergoes neurosurgery, which initially appears to be a success. He gets smart, very smart. The inevitable romance with Ms. Kinian follows, as Charly exceeds all expectations. It is here that the film begins to fall apart and takes a swan dive. In an effort to show the changes in Charly's life, the film shows a collage of stills and scenes of Charly and Ms. Kinian that are ludicrous and almost embarrassing. They are presented in a fashion that is best described as psychedelic. It is done so poorly, as to make the film lose credibility, and it is downhill from there on, as the story becomes one dimensional. The screenplay writer and director should have stuck to the book, both in story and in theme, remembering that you can't fix what ain't broke.

Still, Cliff Robertson's performance, as well as that of Claire Bloom, is worth watching. If you have already read the book, however, prepare to be disappointed. If you have not read the book, as yet, watch the movie first, and then read the book.",1041638400,15,2670,4.979820627802691

How about that John Travolta flick about a man who has a tumor that makes him smart (another ""uplifting"" nineties movie)?  Naturally both (the characters, not the actors unfortunately) are hounded to tragic (but upliftingly-tragic, not sad-tragic) endings by the mob of intolerant villagers afraid of their ""special powers"".
Of course that was a few years ago.  Now we have the new-age touchy-feely let's-get-spiritual nonsense of ""K-Pax"" to keep us home on a Friday night.  Ah, the evolution of American Film.
Well it's (...) like this, that makes me really appreciate Charly for the gem that it is.
Like any good Welshman, director Ralph Nelson (Lilies Of The Field, Soldier Blue) will never use three words when ten will do.  I don't know for sure that he's Welsh (in fact I'm alnost certain he isn't), but he certainly has something to say.
In a nutshell: mentally retarded man gets IQ boosting operation, only to realize the fix isn't permanent.
""Charly"" is part of that golden era of ""legitimate"" Science Fiction: films where ideas and intelligence were still important and dramatization was still taken seriously.  It makes a good book-end to ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" and ""The Andromeda Strain"", and it asks if ethical/moral/social responsibility can keep pace with technology (this is something to think about, now that scientists are busy patenting our genes for their own commercial gain).
Daniel Keyes original short story was evolved into a teleplay, then a novel (1966) and then this feature (1968).  Keyes had several years and many drafts to get the book right.  Nelson and team are not quite as fortunate, but still do an excellent job. Yes, it does on occasion belabor the point, but there are also moments of brilliance:  when the newly developed super-intelligent Charly makes his appearance before a auditorium of scientists (""a television in every room"") it is both funny and prophetic (and I believe this to be intentional); in one exceptional scene he tells us our destinies (with remarkable accuracy), and sees his own tragedy.  He has become a performing mouse, like Algernon running the maze.  And his performance won't last for long.
Some complain about the Biker/Disco/Hippy/Sex and Drugs montage.  Yes, a tad dated.  But Charly is a second grader suddenly thrown into adulthood; he has no way of coping normally so he does the best he can. These sequences might not always work, but they don't fail. They don't hurt the film, they just don't help it as well as they might.
Ralph Nelson has always chosen his feature-films cleverly - he might be a little heavy-handed, but he knows the value of the material and he tries to be faithful to it.  Unlike our contemporary efforts (Powder, et al) where the townsfolk are ignorant and evil and the ""oddity"" is a saint, ""Charly"" (and Nelson) at least pay lip-service to the moral and ethical ambiguities: is making a stupid man smart always a good thing? At least here there's something to think about.
Cliff Robertson, Claire Bloom (she's hot) and the supporting cast all deliver first rate performances.  ""Charly"" was shot Techniscope (2.35) and uses some split-screen sequences that may not reproduce well on pan-and-scan VHS version.  Please let there be a DVD soon!
Yes it has it's short-comings, but as a film (and even better as an SF film) ""Charly"" it s still the equal of Gattaca, Andromeda Strain, or Colossus.  In other words, definitely a must see.",1006387200,7,3593,4.981605351170568
