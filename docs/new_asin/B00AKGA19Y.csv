8553034,5,B00AKGA19Y,"This opera will not suit everyone but it is a magnificent achievement. The staging and costumes of Acts 2 and 3 are most original and a feast of colour, action and song. Pfitzner was an odd bird, a follower of Wagner and a supporter of the Nazis but this work, his masterpiece is an astonishing creation. Like Wagner he uses a tale that is as up-to date as yesterdays newspaper, coming on the election of the new Pope from Argentina it shows little has changed in the centuries since the Council of Trent! The second act is quite masterly and a wonderful spectacle with some very vicious and witty dialogue. My only grumble was the odd decision to put Palestrina and his student into modern dress, it looked ridiculous, especially when everyone else was so wonderfully turned out. The orchestra under the German speaking Australian Simone Young was wonderful and the camera work and picture quality one of if not the best operatic Blu-ray discs I have seen. If only Euro Arts could apply such talent to the operas of say Sallinen, Gershwin and Prokofiev they could greatly enrich our operatic options on Blu-ray. A splendid disc, if you have any taste for post Wagnerian opera do not hesitate.",1363392000,3,1193,4.712918660287081
