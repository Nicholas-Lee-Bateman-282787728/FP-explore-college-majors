7357483,5,B012OQXWF2,"Superb film with excellent footage.  More importantly, so many beautiful quotes about freedom and the human spirit.  BASE is NOT a crime.",1443571200,3,137,5.181818181818182

7357485,2,B012OQXWF2,"The filmmaker, in an interview, referred to herself as ""a poet, not a documentary maker,"" (HOW MODEST!) and she's neither.  This film, as its fawning title makes clear, is an uncritical hagiography of a guy who didn't have his own compound-fractured shin set because of his ""religious beliefs.""

Did he have a death wish? NOOOOOOOOOOO, of course not.  SPOILER: less than a day AFTER setting a BASE record with his wife in Norway he ignores her pleas, LEAVES her in their room, and jumps from another spot they had earlier rejected because they KNEW it would be fatal (they tested the trajectories repeatedly).

Guess what happens?  Yet the very real LIKELIHOOD that this HAD to be suicide (he was a stickler for preparation, equipment, tech, weather conditions, etc. etc.) is NOT explored, apparently because it would violate the ""poetry"" of this pedestrian (double entendre intended) film.

It's incredibly irresponsible to do so.  All we get is the standard BS ""he died doing what he loved blah blah blah"" -- has anyone else ever jumped from this spot? Why or why not?  Should they? Is it possible?
The director thus appoints herself head of her subject's fan club.  If you want to put on your Mickey Mouse ears and join her, go right ahead.  In this day of wing suits, the footage itself is no longer remarkable.",1459123200,,1315,4.778761061946903

7357490,5,B012OQXWF2,"A long overdue documentary about the passions and accomplishments of the unique individual that was Carl Boenish.  I won't repeat the well deserved kudos expressed by others here far more eloquently than I could do.  Having been a skydiver from 1977 to 1989, I remember all of these events from a personal as well as an historical perspective and mourned with Jean and the rest of the community of jumpers, both sky and BASE.  I just wish his other works and projects (Skydive, Wings, et al) would have been re-mastered digitally; fortunately, for those there is youtube.  EFS. EFB.",1450828800,2,582,4.848484848484849

7357492,5,B012OQXWF2,"this is an exquisitely beautiful film, both sensitive and bold, that touches the human spirit in the very depths of our earning and wonder.

This white-knuckle documentary was submitted from the United States to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival. Directed by Marah Strauch, we follow the exciting life of the man who invented Base Jumping, a daredevil sport that entails jumping from impossibly high places (buildings, aerials, spans and earth, e.g., mountains) with a parachute or a para-sail.

Through countless interviews and his own exceptional cinematography, we come to know:
  * Carl Boenish (""Bee' nish""), the good-natured fellow who INVENTED Base Jumping. We learn about the polio that struck him as a child and his determination to regain his strength. This hyper-intelligent and active boy became a piano player, an engineer, a skilled trampoline jumper, a filmmaker, an inventor, and then took up sky diving; but that still wasn't enough...
  * Jean Boenish, is the woman he married. Wait'll you hear what SHE has to say! Carl's friends said he was never interested in the women who flocked around him but when he met Jean, he never hesitated. This unlikely woman happily joined forces with him, became a skilled Base jumper and his soul mate.

She agreed with something he learned in college. ""To wonder HOW is good. To wonder WHY will make you the boss."" She is the perfect wife for this handsome, exuberant and charismatic man.

The filmmaking in the documentary is exceptional: we can't tell when a scene is staged and when it is from Carl's amazing library. In addition, the editing is so impressive I'm still thinking about it. As a Base jumper, Carl and his team visit Houston, Yosemite, Canyon de Chelly and other jaw-dropping jump sites. I've never seen mountain crags as jagged as the ones we see in Norway. Wow!

We enjoy interviews with Jean, fellow Base jumpers, tour guides, TV producers, family members and above all, Carl. Everything about this presentation is worth while. You'll be impressed.",1444262400,2,1949,4.9907407407407405

8726350,5,B012OQXWF2,"This is not just some movie about skydiving or BASE jumping, it is a love story on two levels. One is the love of Carl Boenish - the father of BASE jumping - for the thrill of exercising ""man's dominion over Earth."" The other is his love of his woman and partner in jumping adventures. Sunshine Superman took nearly ten years to reach fruition, and was the first major effort of Marah Strauch, the film's writer, director, producer, and actress (she did a few cameos of a young Jean Boenish), but you sure can't tell it, based on the end result. Strauch achieved just the right blend of original footage, recent interviews, and excellent soundtrack. Even if you cared nothing about thrill seekers, this is a movie worth seeing.",1513036800,,727,4.6434108527131785

8726353,5,B012OQXWF2,"This is a wonderful documentary, and a clear but sensitive examination of the history of Base Jumping. A Topic I had known nothing about.
