8357079,4,B00006HAXQ,"I liked it.  There are two 45-minute segments, one about Mexico City (and the surrounding area) and the other is a trip hitchhiking down the Baja peninsula and then another piece across the Sea of Cortez traveling to Copper Canyon.  In Mexico City the hostess does a good job of mixing with people while looking for an inexpensive hotel and visiting the market ""La Merced"".  She also visits Teotihuacan (Toltec pyramids from around 100 A.D.) and rides a boat around Xochimilco.  She also visits the butterfly sanctuary.

In Baja, our host hitchhikes down the peninsula showing just how vast and lightly populated this area is.  We get to see several destinations such as San Quintin, Bahia de Los Angeles and Mulege (not Cabo) though he does spend a lot of time on the road in insignificant places along the Baja highway.  He doesn't show that much of the Copper Canyon, but he does show the rail trip there.  He bribes the guard and goes to ride outside on the front of the locomotive.",1171584000,7,986,4.658959537572255
