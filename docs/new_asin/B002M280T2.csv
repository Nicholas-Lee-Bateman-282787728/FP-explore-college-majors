8373409,5,B002M280T2,"As a fan of KDramas, this comedic take on the world of art theft and the people who stop them was imaginative and fun.  Kim Sun Ah is such a fantastic actress, and she really breathes life into her characters.

As the daughter of an infamous Art Thief, Kim Sun Ah plays a character who vows to set everything right that her father had made wrong.  She is committed to her country and her country's national treasures, and will do anything to achieve her goals.

Her coworkers can be a bit ridiculous, but good for laughs. The fun parts are really when the two ""opposites attract"" couple interact and create a romantic and exciting storyline.  There is an intense chemistry between the two characters that can be very affecting.  There are scenes between the two, such as in the taxi, that left me breathless.

Hopefully everyone enjoys this series as much as I did!",1332806400,3,865,4.577922077922078
