3002606,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I bought (the brilliant and even better than S5) Spooks Season 6 (I've been buying Spooks since S4 versus 1-3 as MI-5 and overpriced) in Nov 08 for around 15 pounds.  Right now it's around 22 pounds but be patient, it'll go back down.  I think I got Season 5 for 12 or so pounds.  Right now, as we wait for selfsame S6 of MI-5 to come out in US, at a wildly high price, S7 is about to be released at amazon.co.uk (Feb 09) for around 25 pounds -- Season SEVEN, a season ahead of us on verge of release much cheaper than season before (yet on our horizon) UNaffordable on R1.  There's only one sensible answer and that is to purchase a multi-region dvd player.  I had one for ages not even realizing it until it broke down and I got the same model Phillips again (no more expensive than any other topnotch dvd player) since I love the brand and was thrilled the second time around to discover it was region-free and suddenly my horizons (dvdwise) were limitless.  Despite shipping costs at amazon.co.uk being steeper than in US, with the exchange rate being more equal at the moment than in days of yore you can't beat the prices for SOME (some are the same) bbc shows at amazon.co.uk.  E.g., I got the complete and gorgeous set of Sharpe (Sean Bean/15 disks) for ... 25 pounds!  It went back up, doubled I think, after and at the moment isn't available but that's an example of the kinds of bargains you can get at amazon.co.uk.  Oh, by the way, to whet your appetite, as it has mine, in Season 7 of Spooks, Richard Armitage joins the gang.  I'm going to try to wait until it goes down to 15 pounds but the thought of Armitage as the new lead is so tempting I'll probably go the pre-order route for 25 pounds (around $38, plus if you buy the ages-ago-released-in-the-UK S6 of Spooks, that which has prompted this note, it'll only cost you around $35 at the moment and much less later on if you have the patience to wait a bit).  Hoping all these details were at all useful, Trina",1231804800,11,1978,4.304582210242588
3002607,1,B000XJ6EI0,The $80 cost of this DVD is ridiculous.  We love this series and have seen all of the prior episodes but no way would we pay $80 for Season 6!!!!  I would recommend that you rent this from your local library.  They do not charge and they order almost all BBC material and certainly will have this.  Amazon should wake up and price this more reasonably.,1231372800,6,352,4.287878787878788
3002608,1,B000XJ6EI0,"I agree with the other posters.  This is far too expensive, and the alternatives of Netflix or, for those with region-free players, importing from the UK makes sense.

But I love the series, so I expect I will enjoy this season.",1231372800,4,228,4.536585365853658
3002609,1,B000XJ6EI0,"such a tremedous series,but too much $ for just 10 eps...it would be nice to know why..it is not just amazon..bbc items are very expensive all over...tell us, someone at amazon has to know...",1230336000,3,191,4.647058823529412
3002610,1,B000XJ6EI0,I am in agreement with other posts - this price is absurd. I would suggest we all stand firm and resist ordering at such a price. Someone at Amazon has to be listening!,1230249600,13,168,4.121212121212121
3002611,1,B000XJ6EI0,"If the Brits can do it at less than half the price for a much smaller audience, then something fishy is going on.... Shame on the Beeb....again!",1229817600,4,144,4.37037037037037
3002612,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I got hooked on the MI-5 series when it was carried on A&E but since then I've been buying the DVD's to keep up. One thing I don't understand is the price escalation each subsequent volume seems to receive. It's now to the point I can't just go to my favorite on-line merchant (amazon.com) but now I have to shop around for the better price. In the past, several times amazon has lowered their price between the time I pre-order and the time the item actually ships, but this time the price difference I found is hard to ignore.... $11.04 and free shipping! Yep, I found MI-5, Season 6 at [...] for $60.95 with free shipping!

Since we've got a month to go before release, I've placed the title on my wish list at deepdiscount and am going to send a message to amazon about the difference and give them the opportunity to meet or beat the better price. Hopefully they will reduce the price across the board and not just offer it to me. I'll update this comment when I get a response.",1229558400,18,983,4.342391304347826
3002613,4,B000XJ6EI0,"If you have a region-free DVD player, this title is actually cheaper to order from Amazon UK (under its original name of ""Spooks""): 25.98, or about $39 at current exchange rates. By the way, Inspector Morse videos are much cheaper at Amazon UK as well.

That being said, I am looking forward to Series 6. Each series has gotten edgier and more unpredictable, and the online synopses that I've seen indicate that this series will be no exception.",1227830400,5,445,4.705128205128205
3002614,3,B000XJ6EI0,"Wow.  Are they trying to deter the American audience?  I mean, I love MI-5/Spooks... but $80 is just absurd.  Crazy.",1225670400,11,116,4.7

3002628,3,B000XJ6EI0,"We have enjoyed MI 5;  stories were fairly reasonable. We found one big problem - understanding  a lot of the English. Also the set up on every episode didn't get to the point were we could understand what was going on until at least the mid or late point. Still we watched the entire series except for the last season but that was more because we dislike most of the tv shows available.

3002647,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I love it.  MI-5 is one of the best TV series ever made and produced by the British since the 1960s cult classic The Avengers.  It is an action packed, well written and brilliantly acted TV show.  Unlike most modern television shows, each episode of MI-5 is 59 minutes long.  So, a viewer actually gets to a full hour's worth of television programming instead of only 45 minutes.  There are three decisions that I were questionable.  Firstly, I think the producers' only mistake is in the casting of Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed.  Secondly, I seriously question whether someone jacked up the cost of the DVDs by putting only 2 episodes per disc.  Lastly, the BBC's decision to only commission 10 episodes for the season.  The BBC should have commissioned at least 12 if not 16 episodes per season every season.",1410048000,,812,4.702127659574468

Besides all that, Rupert is adorable and very strong yet vulnerable female agents too.  Great over all show.  The only problem I had was that the last disc had about 30 minutes that was unwatchable because it would skip and freeze, it's the DVD not the player.",1405987200,,365,4.5
3002651,5,B000XJ6EI0,"MI-5 was an eye opener.  The no holds barred looked at what happens to protect society is amazing.  Also, the acting is very realistic.  This series will hook you.

If you were a fan of 24 (I am), you have to get this as well!!",1391558400,,227,3.977777777777778
3002652,5,B000XJ6EI0,"If you want a well made and well acted spy thriller, the entire series is for you.
 If you're interested in  purchasing season 6, you probably already know this.
But if you're browsing, and considering trying MI 5 for the first time, then you'd have more fun watching if you started
 with season 1.

But watch out, it's addictive!",1376092800,,330,4.5423728813559325
3002653,5,B000XJ6EI0,MI-5 is what 24 wanted to be if it ever grew up.  Realistic plots with (mostly) realistic solutions.  A great choice if you like spy stories.,1374537600,,141,4.384615384615385
3002654,4,B000XJ6EI0,Of course MI5 is know for killing the favorites usually when they want to leave the show. Wasn't the case in season 10 so all is fair until the last season.,1367625600,,156,4.064516129032258

3002656,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Way above in quality over your usual 'action' movies. Complex and interesting characters, smart, attractive and sometimes flawed.
No resemblance to bland American soap operas with uniformly bland personalities. Politicians (and Americans) portrayed in unflattering style. Powerful women.
This is a superb series and once you are engaged, you have many seasons and many episodes to entertain you.",1364515200,,395,5.827586206896552
3002657,1,B000XJ6EI0,"Am retired CIA, so am perhaps too critical of spy stuff. This series has bad plots, bad acting, ridiculous gadgets and so anti U.S. it is hard to believe the Brits are allies. Really got tired of big bad CIA being responsible for all the world's problems while MI-5 saved the world.",1364169600,2,282,4.4423076923076925
3002658,5,B000XJ6EI0,just a well written show. great watching another perspective besides america's on terrorism and spycraft. well acted and the characters really grab hold of you,1363219200,,159,5.4
3002669,5,B000XJ6EI0,Great stories! This show just keeps getting better! Great dialog and character development. Lots of suspense. Though I hate it when we lose a favorite character! I am going to hate it when we run through all the available seasons.,1363219200,,230,4.775
3002670,5,B000XJ6EI0,The acting is always high quality (even when major characters change); the action is intense and moves right along and the writing is excellent and relevant. Thank you.,1362009600,,168,5.035714285714286
3002671,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Rupert Penry-Jones makes the whole show worth watching. One of the hardest series I have ever watched to not say ""Just one more episode!"" at midnight when I know I should be turning in for bed... I love British crime dramas and this is probably the best I've seen yet!",1361836800,,268,4.38
3002672,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Anyone that likes a good spy mystery, should love this show!

3002673,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Another great season of the best show on TV. It's clear the Brits know how to make great drama series for TV, with the added bonus of being able to see them in their uncut version here on the DVDs. Seeing them uncut makes a huge difference in being able to follow the storyline. Plus, the quality of the packaging and of the DVD's themselves continues to be excellent. Looking forward to completing the series when I get my income tax refund back (I hope).",1361750400,,456,4.376470588235295

3002675,5,B000XJ6EI0,Going back and watching every season. I had forgotten how tightly woven this season was. I so hope BBC brings this show back for another season. I suggest if you haven't watched Mi5 work your way through all the seasons,1360627200,,219,4.5

3002677,5,B000XJ6EI0,"By the start of Season Six, the BBC's ""MI-5"" has thoroughly established itself as one of the world's premier drama shows. The previous five seasons have woven drama, intrigue, excitement, and intelligent storytelling together in a manner rarely seen in television, and each Season has seen us wonder how the enterprise could possible maintain such an accomplishment, yet is only to out-do itself again the following year. Season Six follows that same trajectory accomplishment, and without giving any spoilers, we can say that the series takes a darker and more sinister tone at various points that are perhaps some of the most intense in the series six year track. It can be argued that Season Six is one of the strongest of an already incredibly strong series of Seasons.

MI-5, in case you are unfamiliar with the show, is a section of the security service in the UK that addresses domestic threats. The threats can be of any nature--terrorist, economic, public disturbance, and many others--but these categories of threats are those that are deemed a threat to national security and safety, and MI-5 is called upon to monitor, track, and intervene to address them. The ""MI-5"" television show attempts to tell a dramatized version of this branch of the security services by allowing us to see the individuals who choose to join ""5"" and are often unexpectedly impacted by the requirements of the job as they seek to keep the public safety. The episodes usually deal with one specific threat and 5's response to it, yet many episodes are woven together into a larger, more long running story that encompasses many episodes, sometimes, an entire season. That's why ""MI-5"" is best watched in episode-by-episode order, starting with Season One.

In Season Six, the Section D team of MI-5 is faced with a extra-national threat that brings the entire service into situations both complex and ill-defined, with lots of judgment call decisions, intense risk taking, and the requirement to juggle internal security with political and national demands. In Season Six we see some of the most extended sequences yet, with a story line that weaves a chain from episode to episode throughout the entire Season. It's almost impossible to stop at the end of any given episode: the viewer finds that the pull of the story and the surrounding drama almost demands that the next episode be viewed immediately afterward.

MI-5 is intense, dramatic, powerful, intelligent, and gorgeously filmed and acted. It is certainly one of the best shows the BBC has ever put together, a premier offering among an admittedly excellent grouping of shows already made by them. The series helps us to think upon the issues surrounding intelligence and security in a country, and the intersections between liberty and safety with which any free country must deal. It's a superb exercise in filmmaking.",1325635200,4,2867,5.044303797468355

3002679,5,B000XJ6EI0,"As I have previously indicated on this board, my ""discovery"" of this very fine British spy thriller began with Season seven (7),  After becoming completely besotted with  this BBC  series I started procuring  the seasons that lead up to season seven (7) and now I am at Season six(6) of this great series.  Season six (6) on five (5) discs with ten (10) episodes entertained me greatly.  Season six (6), is filled with loads of breathtaking tense dramas, and lots of ""high tech"" wizardry, that I love.

I am ""hooked""  on the MI-5 spy thriller series and I will continue to purchase future seasons.",1325289600,,597,4.673076923076923
3002680,4,B000XJ6EI0,"Season 5 of MI-5 ended with such a bang that I couldn't wait for Season 6 to begin and to get a better explanation of what happened after Ros and Adam survived the Thames Barrier incident. When I started watching Season 6, I thought I had the wrong disk. Ros and Adam are quickly onto a new adventure and there is a brief comment about getting through the latest escapade and then ""talking about how we got here."" You'll see where they are when the show starts. The Thames Barrier incident is never mentioned again even though I expected there would be more closure to that story.

Instead, Season 6 really takes a turn from the normal story. The whole season is basically one ongoing story with lots of side stories. My favorite character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker, is gone this season and apparently with no explanation. The lovely Gemma Jones joins the cast as Connie James. It's great to see an older actress joining the cast of mainly young actors. The MI-5 cast is a fine group of actors and this makes the show even more special. Alex Lanipekun also joins the cast as a young and dedicated journalist named Ben Kaplan who begins uncovering secrets that neither the Iranian nor the British spies want him to discover. He is a great addition to the cast--a normal, honest guy who unintentionally gets wrapped up in the world of espionage.

This season it is the Iranians who are up to no good yet it is the MI-5 that is responsible for a major disaster in Tehran. Even the ""good"" guys get it wrong and make disastrous decisions. Although Iran and the UK are preparing for a peace agreement, it is becoming clear that Iran is getting the one component it needs to be able to create a nuclear bomb.
Here is where MI-5 must save the UK and the world from an Iranian nuclear bomb. New characters are introduced in the form of the Iranian diplomat and his wife. No one can be believed or trusted. Everyone has his or her own plan of action.

Harry Pearce has no fondness for his American counterparts and it becomes clearer in Season 6 and both the Americans and Brits are out-conniving each other for their own country's needs. The Americans are always playing their own game with their own goals that don't usually coincide with the goals of MI-5. The British spies are definitely the heroes who are saving the world. It's not the Americans this time. In fact, the American spies are usually more egotistical and sinister in their deeds that I would have expected.

There was a lot of action in this season. There were character changes and more in-depth stories. It was clear the series was headed for more and more changes. I can never get enough of MI-5. This season was the most intense. London is always on the brink of destruction and only the MI-5 can save them. I watched the episodes as often as I could but sometimes I had to leave the show for a few days to watch another DVD. I wish this series would have an episode guide. None of the seasons have had one. Episodes are numbered and usually 2 on a disk. It's hard to keep track of what episodes have been watched when there is no name to the episode or a description. I wondered why that information was left out.

Season 6 ends with another big cliff-hanger. Who lives and who dies? I better get to Season 7 now.",1321920000,3,3291,4.460132890365449

I must say that the last few episodes about Iran have been ""over the top"" as far as intrigue, split second timing, taut gripping suspense, blood and violence.  It's a bit too much, I must admit.  The writers have overdone it as far as blood and violence, and I have to hit the mute button and walk away from the screen when it becomes too much to take.  But, that said, there is nothing like it here in the US, and I bet that the intelligence services of this country and all the others are sometimes as clueless as they are portrayed.  I still give this series a 5 star rating. I don't know when it will end, but when it reaches the final episode, I may just start with episode 1, season 1 all over again.

It's a low budget ""24"" without guns. Thus the indulgence.

The disengage?

Somehow the US has become the greatest power in the history of the world, and arguably the most generous and beneficent in history (that's not to excuse the mistakes) but yet we are a bunch of bumbling nitwits that if we are not incompetent are evil. Doing anything to destroy good around the world.

The premise of this season is that they are on the verge of peace with Iran (hah!). Again, it's all a little strange, and a bit embarrassing to see our good British friends appearing so in need of bringing us down to make themselves feel better. Ironically, we usually portray Brits as reliable, competent allies (unlike the French).

**Update. I can't stop watching! It's insane! Seriously, if an American production portrayed Brits or another ally this way there would be a political uproar. You would think it's satirical. Grimacing, scowling American CIA agents. Everyone worried about the Imperial Americans. In all seriousness, Stalin or Kruschev would be proud of this tripe.

I this found this series interesting at first providing fascinating drama into the mind sets of ""spooks""... and the degree they manipulated reality to public at large...

It's an amazing series, well produced, thoughtfully acted, and engrossing to watch.  The main characters are not cardboard cutouts like most of our American TV tends to be.  They're nuanced, both good and bad.  Each has weaknesses and strengths, uncertainties and boundaries that seem to surprise even them.

This season was particularly focused on worldwide Nation relationships, particularly between Briton, US, Iran, Israel and Russia.  All the countries have traitors.  All the countries have heroes.  Nothing is black or white, only shades of gray.

It was fascinating to see a different perspective of the US, one very different from the RedWhiteBlue I'd been raised on and feel in my heart for my country.  All things, people, and countries have multiple sides and facets.  Recognizing the unpleasant aspects of ourselves is the only way we'll become aware of what we need to make better in ourselves.  Both for our own well being and for those around us.  That's why I appreciate seeing, every now and then, a show where we're NOT the ""good guys"".  MI-5 is one of those shows.

To the writers the killing of someone like Hitler is just as evil as blowing up a school full of children. In this series every single problem of the world is either the Americans fault or Israels.

This is the main funding source for the BBC as, by law, it is not allowed to raise funds through commercials on its mainstream TV and Radio channels. Long may it continue ...

Volume 6 will have you tearing your hair out with suspense. Immaculately written, beyond edgy and shockingly wonderful--despite the absence of so many heroes we've grown attached to--only to see them taken away.

So get your hands on it! This is not the place to gripe about price. If you walked out of a broadway production you felt inspired by and excited about, then ran into a friend who asked you what it was like---would you actually tell them it was garbage, simply because you felt it was too pricey?

3002702,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Maybe The Best Ten Hours of Spy TV I Have Ever Seen!!! (Maybe the best TV of ANY GENRE!)

I have watched every episode of MI5 available through DVD - the only way U.S. viewers should do it in order to get the whole story.  Season Six was riveting beyond any TV experience, including 24, which I have ever seen for this type of show.  It was hard to stop watching, and a couple of nights I stayed up way later than I should have because I had to find out what happened next.  Every episode flowed into the next to make what, in effect, was a ten hour movie.

One of the major factors that make MI5 so exciting, and probably somewhat real, is that no one, no one, is safe.  They may not all die, but the ""service"" can take its toll in so many ways.

This can be very heartbreaking because another aspect of MI5 that makes it special is the characters.  We come to identify and appreciate these folks because they are humanized more than is usually seen in these types of series - warts and all!  Far from shining heroes in all their affairs, these spooks make all kinds of mistakes both on and off the job, they lie, cheat, steal, behave badly and come apart at the seams as the stress eats away at their psyches.  In other words, they're just like you and me, only with a much tougher job description.

As a result, these all-too-human secret agents don't always win.  They get played all the time, especially by other intelligent groups who are supposed to be allies.  It is truly a looking glass world.  Indeed, this is a major theme of Season Six.

Sadly, as mentioned in other reviews, the relentless action and intrigue pushes the private lives of Adam, Harry, Ross, Jo and others to the side.  Unlike earlier seasons, there isn't a lot of down time.  They may need to get back to that in future seasons or they risk losing a vital element.

As an American, I am interested in seeing my country through the eyes of others.  At first, it came as a surprise to see the anti-American thread in the show, but as the legacy of Bush-Cheney has rolled out over this decade can anyone really be surprised by this?  Season Six makes sure we don't miss that point.  The season finale, involving two agents facing long torture and horrible death, virtually editorializes this as one of them, not surprisingly, loses their mettle faced with the terror.  Despite the agitprop - I agree but it was facile - this was a powerful moment.

This is great television, start with Season One and sleep when you can.",1234915200,56,2497,4.392156862745098

I just saw Equus in New York with Daniel Radcliffe and paid 250 dollars for two tkts and it was wonderful!  Worth 250 dollars?  In a fair and just world probably not but that again is not the aesthetic fault of the production.

Right now, as we wait for selfsame S6 of MI-5 to come out in US, at a wildly high price, S7 is about to be released at amazon.co.uk (Feb 09) for around 25 pounds -- Season SEVEN, a season ahead of us on verge of release much cheaper than season before (yet on our horizon) UNaffordable on R1.  There's only one sensible answer and that is to purchase a multi-region dvd player.  I had one for ages not even realizing it until it broke down and I got the same model Phillips again (no more expensive than any other topnotch dvd player) since I love the brand and was thrilled the second time around to discover it was region-free and suddenly my horizons (dvdwise) were limitless.  Despite shipping costs at amazon.co.uk being steeper than in US, with the exchange rate being more equal at the moment than in days of yore you can't beat the prices for SOME (some are the same) bbc shows at amazon.co.uk.

It is an action packed, well written and brilliantly acted TV show.  Unlike most modern television shows, each episode of MI-5 is 59 minutes long.  So, a viewer actually gets to a full hour's worth of television programming instead of only 45 minutes.  There are three decisions that I were questionable.  Firstly, I think the producers' only mistake is in the casting of Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed.  Secondly, I seriously question whether someone jacked up the cost of the DVDs by putting only 2 episodes per disc.  Lastly, the BBC's decision to only commission 10 episodes for the season.  The BBC should have commissioned at least 12 if not 16 episodes per season every season.",1410048000,,812,4.702127659574468

3237174,5,B000XJ6EI0,"By the start of Season Six, the BBC's ""MI-5"" has thoroughly established itself as one of the world's premier drama shows. The previous five seasons have woven drama, intrigue, excitement, and intelligent storytelling together in a manner rarely seen in television, and each Season has seen us wonder how the enterprise could possible maintain such an accomplishment, yet is only to out-do itself again the following year. Season Six follows that same trajectory accomplishment, and without giving any spoilers, we can say that the series takes a darker and more sinister tone at various points that are perhaps some of the most intense in the series six year track. It can be argued that Season Six is one of the strongest of an already incredibly strong series of Seasons.

MI-5, in case you are unfamiliar with the show, is a section of the security service in the UK that addresses domestic threats. The threats can be of any nature--terrorist, economic, public disturbance, and many others--but these categories of threats are those that are deemed a threat to national security and safety, and MI-5 is called upon to monitor, track, and intervene to address them. The ""MI-5"" television show attempts to tell a dramatized version of this branch of the security services by allowing us to see the individuals who choose to join ""5"" and are often unexpectedly impacted by the requirements of the job as they seek to keep the public safety. The episodes usually deal with one specific threat and 5's response to it, yet many episodes are woven together into a larger, more long running story that encompasses many episodes, sometimes, an entire season. That's why ""MI-5"" is best watched in episode-by-episode order, starting with Season One.

In Season Six, the Section D team of MI-5 is faced with a extra-national threat that brings the entire service into situations both complex and ill-defined, with lots of judgment call decisions, intense risk taking, and the requirement to juggle internal security with political and national demands. In Season Six we see some of the most extended sequences yet, with a story line that weaves a chain from episode to episode throughout the entire Season. It's almost impossible to stop at the end of any given episode: the viewer finds that the pull of the story and the surrounding drama almost demands that the next episode be viewed immediately afterward.

MI-5 is intense, dramatic, powerful, intelligent, and gorgeously filmed and acted. It is certainly one of the best shows the BBC has ever put together, a premier offering among an admittedly excellent grouping of shows already made by them. The series helps us to think upon the issues surrounding intelligence and security in a country, and the intersections between liberty and safety with which any free country must deal. It's a superb exercise in filmmaking.",1325635200,4,2867,5.044303797468355

3237176,5,B000XJ6EI0,"As I have previously indicated on this board, my ""discovery"" of this very fine British spy thriller began with Season seven (7),  After becoming completely besotted with  this BBC  series I started procuring  the seasons that lead up to season seven (7) and now I am at Season six(6) of this great series.  Season six (6) on five (5) discs with ten (10) episodes entertained me greatly.  Season six (6), is filled with loads of breathtaking tense dramas, and lots of ""high tech"" wizardry, that I love.

I am ""hooked""  on the MI-5 spy thriller series and I will continue to purchase future seasons.",1325289600,,597,4.673076923076923
3237177,4,B000XJ6EI0,"Season 5 of MI-5 ended with such a bang that I couldn't wait for Season 6 to begin and to get a better explanation of what happened after Ros and Adam survived the Thames Barrier incident. When I started watching Season 6, I thought I had the wrong disk. Ros and Adam are quickly onto a new adventure and there is a brief comment about getting through the latest escapade and then ""talking about how we got here."" You'll see where they are when the show starts. The Thames Barrier incident is never mentioned again even though I expected there would be more closure to that story.

Instead, Season 6 really takes a turn from the normal story. The whole season is basically one ongoing story with lots of side stories. My favorite character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker, is gone this season and apparently with no explanation. The lovely Gemma Jones joins the cast as Connie James. It's great to see an older actress joining the cast of mainly young actors. The MI-5 cast is a fine group of actors and this makes the show even more special. Alex Lanipekun also joins the cast as a young and dedicated journalist named Ben Kaplan who begins uncovering secrets that neither the Iranian nor the British spies want him to discover. He is a great addition to the cast--a normal, honest guy who unintentionally gets wrapped up in the world of espionage.

This season it is the Iranians who are up to no good yet it is the MI-5 that is responsible for a major disaster in Tehran. Even the ""good"" guys get it wrong and make disastrous decisions. Although Iran and the UK are preparing for a peace agreement, it is becoming clear that Iran is getting the one component it needs to be able to create a nuclear bomb.
Here is where MI-5 must save the UK and the world from an Iranian nuclear bomb. New characters are introduced in the form of the Iranian diplomat and his wife. No one can be believed or trusted. Everyone has his or her own plan of action.

Harry Pearce has no fondness for his American counterparts and it becomes clearer in Season 6 and both the Americans and Brits are out-conniving each other for their own country's needs. The Americans are always playing their own game with their own goals that don't usually coincide with the goals of MI-5. The British spies are definitely the heroes who are saving the world. It's not the Americans this time. In fact, the American spies are usually more egotistical and sinister in their deeds that I would have expected.

There was a lot of action in this season. There were character changes and more in-depth stories. It was clear the series was headed for more and more changes. I can never get enough of MI-5. This season was the most intense. London is always on the brink of destruction and only the MI-5 can save them. I watched the episodes as often as I could but sometimes I had to leave the show for a few days to watch another DVD. I wish this series would have an episode guide. None of the seasons have had one. Episodes are numbered and usually 2 on a disk. It's hard to keep track of what episodes have been watched when there is no name to the episode or a description. I wondered why that information was left out.

Season 6 ends with another big cliff-hanger. Who lives and who dies? I better get to Season 7 now.",1321920000,3,3291,4.460132890365449
3237178,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I have watched every episode of every season through episode 5 of season 6.  I must say that the last few episodes about Iran have been ""over the top"" as far as intrigue, split second timing, taut gripping suspense, blood and violence.  It's a bit too much, I must admit.  The writers have overdone it as far as blood and violence, and I have to hit the mute button and walk away from the screen when it becomes too much to take.  But, that said, there is nothing like it here in the US, and I bet that the intelligence services of this country and all the others are sometimes as clueless as they are portrayed.  I still give this series a 5 star rating. I don't know when it will end, but when it reaches the final episode, I may just start with episode 1, season 1 all over again.

It's a low budget ""24"" without guns. Thus the indulgence.

The disengage?

Somehow the US has become the greatest power in the history of the world, and arguably the most generous and beneficent in history (that's not to excuse the mistakes) but yet we are a bunch of bumbling nitwits that if we are not incompetent are evil. Doing anything to destroy good around the world.

The premise of this season is that they are on the verge of peace with Iran (hah!). Again, it's all a little strange, and a bit embarrassing to see our good British friends appearing so in need of bringing us down to make themselves feel better. Ironically, we usually portray Brits as reliable, competent allies (unlike the French).

**Update. I can't stop watching! It's insane! Seriously, if an American production portrayed Brits or another ally this way there would be a political uproar. You would think it's satirical. Grimacing, scowling American CIA agents. Everyone worried about the Imperial Americans. In all seriousness, Stalin or Kruschev would be proud of this tripe.

They make British intelligence look like boobs too. Running into buildings where they know there are armed enemies without guns. Never using overwhelming force when they can. It's embarrassing.",1302480000,2,1326,5.059633027522936

While this series began with attempting to copy 24, they lacked the ability to match American Technology or the suspense generated... in fact the first main agent was quickly replaced, being a whimp... replaced by the character Adam, who while is NO Jack Bauer has some rudimentary skills. I this found this series interesting at first providing fascinating drama into the mind sets of ""spooks""... and the degree they manipulated reality to public at large...

  This track of blaming American Aggression on imperialism is absurd... MAYBE, just maybe someone in the UK should think about where they would be today, IF Brave American soldiers did stop Nazi Imperialism!! Really!  Freaking Progressive Liberalism of the BBC ...

It's an amazing series, well produced, thoughtfully acted, and engrossing to watch.  The main characters are not cardboard cutouts like most of our American TV tends to be.  They're nuanced, both good and bad.  Each has weaknesses and strengths, uncertainties and boundaries that seem to surprise even them.

This season was particularly focused on worldwide Nation relationships, particularly between Briton, US, Iran, Israel and Russia.  All the countries have traitors.  All the countries have heroes.  Nothing is black or white, only shades of gray.

It was fascinating to see a different perspective of the US, one very different from the RedWhiteBlue I'd been raised on and feel in my heart for my country.  All things, people, and countries have multiple sides and facets.  Recognizing the unpleasant aspects of ourselves is the only way we'll become aware of what we need to make better in ourselves.  Both for our own well being and for those around us.  That's why I appreciate seeing, every now and then, a show where we're NOT the ""good guys"".  MI-5 is one of those shows.  Give it a try if you've not already.  It's worth the investment of time.",1271116800,7,1260,4.872641509433962
3237186,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I absolutely love this series. It's well written, the characters are well developed, the plots are surpising. I have to be careful not to watch it right before going to bed because it gets my adrenaline going and it's hard to go to sleep.",1270771200,5,238,4.431818181818182

No matter what anyone else did, the Americans were always blamed or thought to be the greater evil even more than a nuclear Iran.  Interesting perspective.  It appears to be anti-American propaganda. I liked the early seasons of MI-5 but did not care for this one.  The low rating is not for the price but for the content.",1268524800,4,398,4.410958904109589

In one of the episodes the Americans are supposedly going to assassinate a genocidal dictator on British soil. The moral equivalency is disgusting. To the writers the killing of someone like Hitler is just as evil as blowing up a school full of children. In this series every single problem of the world is either the Americans fault or Israels. It never could be the people whose lives only meaning are to kill the infidels.

I sure hope season 7 gets back to some rationality.",1267142400,5,652,4.6695652173913045

I love this show.  The actors were effective as agents and heartwrenching as characters.  The last epi did it for me. As the other commentors stated, epi 10 and a few others were dark and realistic. Rupert is the man. As always Harry Pearce was dapper, intriguing, SEXY as hell, and was totally the leader of the group.  More insight into quirky Malcom also. Jo was sweet and resourceful.  The new guy is still new, but very promising.  He listens to his instincts which is good. I can't wait for S7.",1247616000,9,676,4.234375
3237190,5,B000XJ6EI0,"The MI-5 (Spooks in the UK) series is simply fantastic! However, it seems that the US pricing is rather high compared to that in the UK. The reason why it is reasonably priced in the UK is that the BBC, unlike commercial broadcasters, being a publicly broadcaster, is directly subsidised (paid for) by the UK population to the tune of $200 (approx) per year per license. This is the main funding source for the BBC as, by law, it is not allowed to raise funds through commercials on its mainstream TV and Radio channels. Long may it continue ...
So dear US friends: Please support the BBC and keep our license fee down by buying BBC material and don't moan about the price ;-)",1245801600,10,676,4.459677419354839

Yes, about $25-26 **including shipping.** So, if the only thing holding you back from getting this GREAT series is the price and the fact that it's Region 2, check your DVD player or consider getting a new one for the money you're saving (and WILL be saving on future great world-wide DVDs) and take the plunge!

I don't know if the U.S. price problem lies with Amazon or the dictates of the BBC, but ultimately as it's up to you where you spend your money, I'm sure Amazon is happy that they're making money *somewhere*, and not ticking people off, forcing them to leave their site.

3237194,5,B000XJ6EI0,"This is the review to read. I've seen every volume of MI-5 including season 6. Every season I've feared this brilliant show would deteriorate. After all, how could any series stay so riveting year after year? But each season I'm breathless with admiration that they consistently top themselves. Volume 6 will have you tearing your hair out with suspense. Immaculately written, beyond edgy and shockingly wonderful--despite the absence of so many heroes we've grown attached to--only to see them taken away. I don't know of any other show that regularly kills their most beloved characters without disturbing the perfection. Bottom line, this is even better than the previous seasons. So get your hands on it! This is not the place to gripe about price. If you walked out of a broadway production you felt inspired by and excited about, then ran into a friend who asked you what it was like---would you actually tell them it was garbage, simply because you felt it was too pricey? These reviews should be about content so that you can look at the number of stars and get an idea at a glance about the quality. Let people here decide for themselves how to spend their discretionary income. Those of you who gave a low rating...watch season 6. I dare you to do anything but rave. Then, see if you could throw a few more stars up there out of respect for this show.

3237199,5,B000XJ6EI0,"Maybe The Best Ten Hours of Spy TV I Have Ever Seen!!! (Maybe the best TV of ANY GENRE!)

I have watched every episode of MI5 available through DVD - the only way U.S. viewers should do it in order to get the whole story.  Season Six was riveting beyond any TV experience, including 24, which I have ever seen for this type of show.  It was hard to stop watching, and a couple of nights I stayed up way later than I should have because I had to find out what happened next.  Every episode flowed into the next to make what, in effect, was a ten hour movie.

One of the major factors that make MI5 so exciting, and probably somewhat real, is that no one, no one, is safe.  They may not all die, but the ""service"" can take its toll in so many ways.

This can be very heartbreaking because another aspect of MI5 that makes it special is the characters.  We come to identify and appreciate these folks because they are humanized more than is usually seen in these types of series - warts and all!  Far from shining heroes in all their affairs, these spooks make all kinds of mistakes both on and off the job, they lie, cheat, steal, behave badly and come apart at the seams as the stress eats away at their psyches.  In other words, they're just like you and me, only with a much tougher job description.

As a result, these all-too-human secret agents don't always win.  They get played all the time, especially by other intelligent groups who are supposed to be allies.  It is truly a looking glass world.  Indeed, this is a major theme of Season Six.

Sadly, as mentioned in other reviews, the relentless action and intrigue pushes the private lives of Adam, Harry, Ross, Jo and others to the side.  Unlike earlier seasons, there isn't a lot of down time.  They may need to get back to that in future seasons or they risk losing a vital element.

As an American, I am interested in seeing my country through the eyes of others.  At first, it came as a surprise to see the anti-American thread in the show, but as the legacy of Bush-Cheney has rolled out over this decade can anyone really be surprised by this?  Season Six makes sure we don't miss that point.  The season finale, involving two agents facing long torture and horrible death, virtually editorializes this as one of them, not surprisingly, loses their mettle faced with the terror.  Despite the agitprop - I agree but it was facile - this was a powerful moment.

This is great television, start with Season One and sleep when you can.",1234915200,56,2497,4.392156862745098
3237200,5,B000XJ6EI0,"I was looking for TV Shows on DVD when I saw the 3 star average for MI 5 and just had to comment.  The negative reviews are about price and while I understand that as a legit observation in a review, it isn't the fault of the creative team....actors, directors, writers....of one of the best shows ever for TV (The Wire and The Shield being the ""others"") that the ""money folk"" put a high price on the product.  I just saw Equus in New York with Daniel Radcliffe and paid 250 dollars for two tkts and it was wonderful!  Worth 250 dollars?  In a fair and just world probably not but that again is not the aesthetic fault of the production.  So those of you who are new to MI 5... and yes Spooks is better and cheaper if you have an R 2 system....don't be mislead by the talk about price.  TV doesn't get any better than this.  So don't spend money on ""blockbuster"" drivel and save your money for MI 5",1234569600,31,898,4.15606936416185

Yes, the set is pricey, but the purpose here is to review the PROGRAM.  And in my opinion, this was the tightest, most engaging season yet. Superb writing, heinous villains, a couple of complete surprises, and a great cliff-hanger.  Instead of spending my money on most of the junk currently playing in the cinemas, this is much more rewarding entertainment.  (And there are no cell phones ringing, noisy children, or candy munchers to contend with!)
