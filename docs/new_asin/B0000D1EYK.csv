7999974,4,B0000D1EYK,"I can't actually recommend the DVDs for ""Still Game"" because I haven't watched them.  But I saw several episodes of the show the last time I was in Britain and never laughed so much at any TV sitcom.  Who'd have thought that a show about two cantankerous, elderly Scotsmen could be so entertaining?

If ever these are produced in a format viewable in the US, I'm game!  I'd have the lot.  Jack & Victor forever!
