5178191,4,B008PDAFKY,"This is a good documentary that highlights how people are victimized by ""pit bull"" bans in four US cities.  It illustrates the fact that almost any short-haired dog can be labeled a ""pit bull"" and that owners are subjected to senseless discrimination and are less equal than other dog owners before the law.

Breed-specific legislation does not address owner or dog behaviour.  It targets people because of the physical appearance of their family pet and is based on a long-running propaganda campaign.  Thousands of dogs have been seized and killed because of these barbaric laws, yet there has been zero improvement in public safety.

Government by tabloid is unacceptable. Even if you don't own a dog, you should see this movie.  I guarantee it will shake any preconceived ideas you may have about dogs, dog owners and ""pit bulls"" and will also show you how your right to own personal property is very vulnerable to abuse.",1349308800,6,925,4.897435897435898
5178192,5,B008PDAFKY,"This movie details the hype behind the media and political hysteria about a dog of a certain shape, and is very informative and educational.  It's a must-see to understand how the public's perception is manipulated by the media.",1349308800,4,228,5.0
5178193,5,B008PDAFKY,"I was able to see this movie at a local theater showing and loved it so much that I purchased the DVD.  It documents the impact of Breed Specific Laws (BSL) on owners and the facts surrounding the issue.  What is truly disheartening is the role that media plays on the public's perception of different breeds of dogs.  How many times do we need to tell people that it is the PERSON at the other end of the leash which is the problem?  Once you see this video, you may also want to read ""Lost Dogs"" which is a book about what happened to Michael Vick's dogs, which were pitbulls, and then advocate for laws that penalize the bad owners and not the breeds.",1349308800,4,654,4.25
5178194,5,B008PDAFKY,"For the Pit bull lover, this movie will only strengthen what we already know. For the people who believe all the horror stories the media says about Pit bulls, this movie is a must see!!  It will change your perception of these beautiful souls. Very well done.",1349308800,18,260,4.531914893617022
5178195,5,B008PDAFKY,"I have seen this movie three times now and enjoyed it every time.  Before I finally rescued a Pit Bull Type Dog I believed the hype.  I was aware of all of the information that is given and the movie but was so happy that someone put it into a film and so many came out to see it.  It shows you how dogs are killed on a regular basis simply because of how they look, not by what they have done.  This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone.  My mom is getting a copy for Christmas.",1349308800,11,490,3.8118811881188117
5178196,5,B008PDAFKY,"This movie is a must see for anyone who owns an animal period. Very eye opening on the stupidity of Breed Specific Legislation. Anyone who thinks ""viscous"" when they hear Pit Bull needs to watch this to just see how wrong they are!",1349308800,6,231,4.395348837209302
5178197,5,B008PDAFKY,This film is well worth seeing...an eye opener to the breed discrimination that continues to tear loving companion animals from their families.  Heartbreaking.,1349308800,7,159,5.913043478260869

5178199,5,B008PDAFKY,"I love dogs, but never had a strong opinion one way or another about pit bull breeds, although I'd probably avoid one just to be safe. This documentary really opened my eyes to the discrimination that happens for absolutely no reason other than physical characteristics. I realize now what a great breed these dogs are, and I'd adopt one. If you have a soul, this movie will make you cry. But don't shy away from it for that reason. This is something you need to know about!",1349136000,57,474,4.459770114942529
5178200,5,B008PDAFKY,"This documentary is very powerful, as well as it is informative. As a fellow pit bull owner, I feel that this film does a great job at creating awareness about the issue that pit bulls have negative reputation for being dangerous and vicious. The stories featured throughout are heartfelt and inspiring. It definitely inspired me to take more action to raise awareness. If you have or have ever owned a loving pit bull, then you should take time and watch this documentary! By the end of it, you'll find yourself wanting to take a stand against the laws that prohibit people in certain cities the right to own a pit bull. You won't be disappointed!",1348704000,44,648,4.643478260869565

5178210,5,B008PDAFKY,"Very moving and due to lack of public education everyone should watch this. So much has changed, but I was never aware of those issues in other cities and what those families had to go through. It was sad to see that some families lost their pets and couldn't do much about it. Incredible piece, must watch and help educate others, because this will never go away. Stop BSL and understand the breed itself is not at fault, it is the human and the environment. Pits are one of the sweetest dogs ever and I don't even own one. Best 'nanny' dog ever and I was never bitten by a pit just other breeds that are suited as family pets. The most dangerous dog is UNTRAINED dog no matter the breed.",1481932800,,689,4.267175572519084

furthermore.....  chaining a dog is one way to make some dogs aggressive.... i never ever chain my rotts or gsd and if anyone gets a dog from me thats in the contract... these dogs get protective aggressive and stressed when chained and if i suspect or see the chaining of a dog with my name it will be forfit to my possesion..... and ill see that the dog never gets chained again.  a fenced yard or daily walks is what i recomend...... best case they go to a farm and run free for a while every day..... that makes for a happy rottweiler german shepherd or any dog including what many call pitt bulls.",1466640000,,1092,4.230769230769231

Very compassionately presented to show that any dog, regardless of size or strength, can make a great companion dog.  The statistics were depressing and the ignorance of people never ceases to surprise me!  Personally, I believe the chihuahua is the most ill-tempered breed, and they're one of the smallest.

As many supporters interviewed stated, the issue of breed discrimination should not just be a concern for those that own the type of breeds discussed, but an overall concern for anyone that owns and loves animals. Not only that, this issue is not justvan animal issue but a moral issue. Must see for anyone looking to add fuel FROM FACTS to any argument!

I only have one complaint, and that is when they're showing a dogfight that you not only see it, but hear the dog being attacked screaming in pain. As anyone who is an animal lover, this was a bit much to watch. Also, knowing Pitbull type breeds have a high threshold for pain, it made me stop the video during this brutal attack, knowing how much this dog was suffering.

5178304,5,B008PDAFKY,"I've never been an animal person. I never wanted the responsibility for another living thing. Yet one day a dog was brought to my house because she attacked another dog and nearly killed it. If you judge by that sentence alone then she sounds like a bad dog but the facts are: 1)she's an American Bulldog which is a terrier breed just like a little yorkie (but bigger) 2) She was one of 4 dogs in a house where the owners expected all dogs to act the same. They let the dogs manage themselves. There was no leadership by the owners what so ever. 3) One of the dogs in her pack was a small dog with a Nepolian complex. The little dog started the fight. She picked the dog up and shook like terriers are bred (by us humans) to do. Her breeder went and got her so the owner wouldn't killer her and she was stuck on our porch in a cage.

I couldn't leave her there so I brought her inside. I gave her a little bit of attention and before I knew it the dog had adopted me. I began to work immediately on her rehabilitation. I dominance trained her so just a disapproving sound will stop her from what she is doing. She knows sit, laydown, leave it, upstairs, down stairs, bed. I grab her face, attack her with pillows, pull her tail and lay on her daily. I know she is safe around children. She's even been grabbed in the face by a baby and she handled it with grace. She is still dog aggressive; thanks to the inadequate care of her first parents and the rarity of opportunities to fix this problem. That is not her fault. But since I got her she can now be trusted to go outside and play with other dogs. We have a no petting policy when she is outside. If we have another dog in the house, they are kept separated because our experience is that at some point she will attack the other dog. This isn't her fault. Had her first parents been educated on how to properly raise dogs then this issue wouldn't be something that had to be managed.

This is the essence of what this video is trying to show.",1449360000,3,1996,4.155038759689923

It is all about how the dog is raised and trained. This film is so educational on the truth about Pit Bulls! I have a beautiful rescued pittie and he has the biggest heart and is so full of love. He is a huge playful goober. He wouldn't hurt a fly. He was in a kill shelter in the south and was 20 minutes of being euthanized when he did nothing wrong. It broke my heart! Here is a dog with so much love to give and they wouldn't even think twice about putting him down. BSL laws are outrageous! I hate that there are places that I would never be able to move to because they see him as a threat just because of his breed. You really have no idea how bad these dogs have it because it is so much worse than you think. Watching this will make you look at the bully breeds in a whole new light! If you are someone on the fence about bully breeds watch this film. There are a lot of proven facts showing how wonderful these dogs truly are.

***please note there are some images in this film that are not for the faint of heart. But it is the sad truth of what these breeds go through.

As you read this dozens of bully breeds are being abused, tortured, neglected, and euthanized just because of who they are.

The content brings you to tears at times, but it is important for people to realize how many wonderful pets are being slaughtered due to ignorance.  There is no bad breed, only bad owners and breeders.  Other breeds had a similar stigma in the past (Dobermans and Rottweilers), but never to the extant where laws were enacted requiring owners to relinquish their pets for euthanasia or move out of the city, state or country.  Many of the pit bulls that were seized from their owners were kind, gentle family pets.  These people considered them family members.  Also, even though it's been proven over and over that a great many ""fighting dogs"" can be rehabilitated, Pit Bulls continue to be killed by Animal Control across the country.

Worf was a pit mix - unwanted , unloved I got him when he was 6 weeks old, afraid of his own shadow.
He grew up to be a terrific dog.
My friends had purebreds, - again , loving, sweet dogs.
These dogs got a bad wrap because of people. - Mostly the worst kind.
Those morons MAKE these dogs vicious, and bite for bite your Shepard is a lot more dangerous ( look it up).
It's not okay to descriminate among people, it's okay to put a breed of dog down, though.
What kind of society are we living in?
We need laws to prosecute the vicious individuals who turn these dogs into killers , because they are too cowardly to be the vicious animals they were born to be themselves. ( Wanna be tough guys who lack the guts!)
And a breed that is just a dog pays the price.
Tell you what - I have a dog , a loving, caring canine and what scares me is that he could be classified as ""vicious"" at any given time.
He is considered ""Property"", not family!
Isn't it time we revoked these laws and looked at reality?

Of course this skews the statistics when compared to other breeds. Of the thousands of ""pit bulls"" that  have been killed by local governments, many were not registered purebreds.  Learn how they are categorized by physical characteristics.

5178361,1,B008PDAFKY,"Terrible narration, terrible music, and absolutely zero sense of social responsibility make this a complete failure on all levels, but let's be honest here: director Libby Sherrill did not intend to make a proper film. Rather, this is an incredibly perverse and dangerous piece of fictional propaganda which strives for the legitimizing of a justifiably feared and reviled breed of dog. This dog is responsible for more damage than any other breed, and in most areas of the United States, more than all other breeds combined. The proof is staggering; however the sociopathic  pit bull apologist has a loyalty to this sick crusade that indeed appears to be religious in nature. My neighbor's child was bitten to death by a pit bull in New Jersey last year, and already this year the dogs have killed at least 20 people nationwide. There have been no other reported dog fatalities, beyond these pit bull deaths. The reported bit bull attacks (non-fatal) are in the thousands. It's impossible to even begin to keep up.

I wonder what kind of soap Libby uses to wash all of that blood off her hands? The pit bull apologist phenomenon is a distinctly American one, their tactics horrifyingly similar to the efforts of the Westboro Baptist Church and the NRA to intimidate victims and spread as much misinformation as possible.

Supporting a film like this is about as socially irresponsible and malicious as a human being can possibly get. It is also causing more and more pit bulls to be euthanized and abused with her patently fictitious claims, because she is increasing the demand for them. Shame on you, Libby Sherrill.

All whites are racists.
All blacks kill people.
All Indians scalp people.
All humans will commit murder!
All blondes are stupid!
All Rat Terriers kill rats, well this one might be true.

It is an age old story that can, and has been projected onto all of us, whether it is sex, color or religion.  The ridiculous amount of money spent on ineffective breed ban legislation should go to; Bite prevention education, and special task forces for animal cruelty and neglect, carrying convictions of jail time, community service in an animal shelter (no unsupervised contact with the animals-cleaning cages, equipment, phones etc.) and monetary fines, with the animal being confiscated and put up for adoption; Task forces for animal fighting rings, which are intrinsically connected with drugs and crime, with minimum 20 year jail sentence that must be served with psychological evaluation and mandatory therapy, monetary fines equaling the evaluated win from the fight bust/or $20,000. minimum with judge discretion for higher, and animal ownership ban for life and put on nation wide animal cruelty registry.

This film did a great job speaking for for those without a voice and for those of us who are responsible.  I've realized I'm not the only pit bill owner who is facing these injustices and it's been worse for others.  I can't believe that dogs were confiscated and euthanized because of how the dog looks, not the way a dog acts.  I thought witch hunts were a problem of the past.  I was wrong.  The only problem this breed has endured is being owned by irresponsible people who mistreat them and facing politicians who are modern day Hitlers. The message is clear, they ban pit bulls, what's next?

5178369,1,B008PDAFKY,"Pit bulls are responsible for more than 50% of all dog bite fatalities in the United States, and a corresponding proportion of serious injuries.

When was the last time a golden retriever was responsible for a double amputation?

The injuries we are seeing from pit bulls are closer to those from victims of IED's in Iraq than they are to anything we would expect from a dog.

The facts are clear and unequivocal.

30 countries and hundreds of communities have been pit bulls, but not because of ""irrational prejudice.""

They have done so because pit bulls are MAIMING AND KILLING CHILDREN EVERY DAY.
I am beginning to wonder whether pit bull owners are even HUMAN.

A human being feels compassion for other humans. If you do not, you are not human.

Once you realize that pit bulls were BRED to attack without warning, to apply a kill bite, were BRED to have enormously strong jaws capable of ripping limbs off of people, how could you possibly consider owning one?

To own a pit bull is a crime against humanity.

Pit bull ""community"" should be regarded as a terrorist organization.

5178376,5,B008PDAFKY,"I only began researching BSL when I took on a pittie mix as a foster dog. And what I discovered shocked me. Yes, they are strong and determined dogs, which means they need an owner who is willing to train & socialize them properly. But the breed has been unjustly demonized.

This movie was a real eye-opener and gave me plenty of statistics to back up what most pibble owners already know. These dogs are generally extremely people-centric and loving. They can have a tendency toward dog aggression if not properly socialized at a young age - but that is true of many different breeds from Australian Cattle Dogs to Chihuahuas. The statistic that really got me  was: ""90% of all fatal dog attacks involve an un-neutered male, 36% happen in a location where breeding has recently occurred, and 19% involve a dog who is chained."" Another one is that many who are convicted of dog-fighting - which is supposed to be a felony - get something ridiculous like 20 hours of community service. Truly the problem is not the breed but owners and penalties should be much, much stiffer. But to round up and euthanize family pets who have never done anything wrong or ever shown signs of aggression is completely unconstitutional in my opinion..

Back to my foster, I decided to keep her. Based on the attitudes I got from people - ""wow, she's so friendly for a pit bull"", ""I could never have a dog like that because people are afraid of them"", ""are you sure she's OK w/ the kids"", etc...

I do not own one myself, but I care for them just the same! I've been doing my best to educate people about ""dangerous"" breeds and the fact that it is not the breed that makes them dangerous, it is how they are trained, treated, and raised from a pup that shapes their lives. Michael Vick tortured, killed, and fought Pitbulls and because of that, I think, is what causes people to think they are dangerous. If this breed is guilty of anything, it is of loving too much and aggressively giving kisses. Dogs are people pleasers, so they do what they can to please us and make us happy. They won't attack unless provoked or TRAINED to attack. Do not judge a dog by their breed or how they look, because that is all you know of the dog. Get to know the dog before judging, please.

It is really worth your time to watch even if you don't even have a dog.,1349481600,11,302,3.590909090909091
5178402,5,B008PDAFKY,By far the most educational movie out there in regards to BSL and breed discrimination. BSL can (likely will) affect EVERYONE that owns a dog-this movie is not just for pitty owners!,1349481600,15,182,4.71875
5178403,5,B008PDAFKY,"This movie is amazing. Whether you have pit bulls in your home or not, you will be moved and touched, just knowing that people's family pets are being taken and killed because of how they look. Lots of facts and figures, too. You will come out knowing much more than when you went in.",1349395200,5,284,4.277777777777778
5178404,5,B008PDAFKY,"I usually don't like documentaries, but this one really hit home.  I am a pit mom, so I may be biased :). But in all honesty I felt like this film focused on the facts and helped paint the picture of how this ""bully"" breed became the enemy. I also liked how the film focused on the responsibility and accountability of the owner. All around A+ from me.",1349395200,5,352,4.176470588235294
5178405,5,B008PDAFKY,This film is an excellent portrayal of what the media and the misinformed have done to an amazing breed of dog. Beyond the Myth highlights almost every major point in the ongoing battle against breed specific legislation. It's heartbreaking to know that thousands of innocent animals have died at the hands of a myth that continues to be perpetrated by media outlets looking for ratings. If you love animals you MUST see this film.,1349395200,14,431,4.837837837837838
5178406,5,B008PDAFKY,"I saw the film ""Beyond the Myth"" last spring in Louisville Kentucky while also meeting the producer and director Libby Sherrill.  A lifelong animal advocate, I thought I was aware of the majority of abuse, neglect and lack of legislation that punished animal abusers.  However, this documentary enlightened me to the ignornace, prejudice and injustice against Pit Bulls and Pit Bull breed mixes.  Being an owner of two Pit Mix dogs, and know for a fact how wonderfully loving these dogs are, I was outraged and deeply saddened at the lack of knowledge about the breed and the general public's perception of these dogs.  BSL is discrimatory, unjustified, and plain wrong.  Beyond the Myth provides the background to learning how to educate the general public while showing what is happening behind the scenes - both pro & con - and what one can do to be proactively involved to protect and provide responsible guardianship to not only pit bulls - but all companion animals.  BSL may start with discrimination against Pit Bulls, but it doesn't end.  BSL can happen to any breed.",1349395200,21,1076,4.8791208791208796
5178407,5,B008PDAFKY,"I am a huge dog lover and I had no idea what was happening to ""pit bull"" type dogs (and many other breeds too). I also had no idea some of my ideas were based in discrimination. **Eye opening, heartbreaking, life changing. A MUST SEE for animal lovers and those that need to be shown the truth.**",1349395200,14,296,4.2105263157894735
5178408,5,B008PDAFKY,"I have always LOVED dogs but I must admit, I have not always loved pit bulls or really knew anything about them. It wasn't until a couple years ago when we rescued our petite pitty Cassie that my world changed. I would recommend this documentary to ANY dog lover, not just those that love the breed. Here's why. Breed specific legislation can happen to any breed. Once it happens to one breed it then spirals out of control to now there are states that ban 10 breeds of dogs and the list is going. It comes down to the fact that the individual dogs on a case by case basis. BSL is like the witch hunting in the early ages. The checklist that some cities use is a complete crock. If a dog has certain characteristics then it's a ""pit"". If we labeled people like that we'd be getting sued left and right. The breed does not matter, it goes down to how the dog is raised, trained, and socialized. Let's look at statistics people, Golden Retrievers have the most bites. Bottom line is owners should be held responsible and we all must stand against this or your breed could be next. Don't think it can't or won't happen. That's what the people of Denver, CO thought and then the next thing they knew they had people knocking on their dogs and seizing their dogs. BSL also violates a person's fourth amendment rights to unreasonable search and seizure. As long as my dog is being taken care of and is not bothering anyone it should not matter what breed I own. The government needs to step back and the citizens need to demand change and not allow them to continue. This WILL be stopped. It's only a matter of time.

This DVD does a great explanation to those that are unfamiliar with BSL and to those that are. I highly recommend because we can't sit idly by and do nothing. We must do something.",1349395200,64,1792,4.365269461077844
5178409,5,B008PDAFKY,"Whether you are a dog lover or not EVERYONE should have a problem with BSL.  It's discriminatory, unnecessary and completely un-American, I would go so far as to call it an infringement on your civil liberties.  Not to mention BSL just plain doesn't work!  NO ONE should be able to come take your pet (that has shown no aggression) from you because they THINK it's a certain breed.  Open the door to this and ANY dog can get banned.  The way to stop BSL is to be informed and this movie informs you about BSL. Buy it , buy two, share it, tell everyone you know to watch it. Senseless killing of dogs because they are born looking a certain way is ignorant. No dog is born vicious they are taught by deed or neglect. Punish the person who caused/allowed the dog to become dangerous. Killing the dog doesn't prevent the cause (HUMAN NEGLIGENCE) from occurring again.",1349395200,4,864,4.477707006369426
5178410,5,B008PDAFKY,"Libby did a great job with the film, I really enjoyed it! I hope it really opens people's eyes to the horrible world of Breed Specific Legislation, and I think it will! Can't wait to see it again!",1349308800,4,196,4.184210526315789
5178411,5,B008PDAFKY,"This documentary illminated the problem, that exist in many cities, as civil liberties are taken from its citizens. Beyond the Myth illistrates how civil liberties have affected One specific breed of dog. By using the example of Pitt Bulls, it shows how such laws discrimate against dogs of this breed that have done nothing to deserve such treatment. How far does discrmination have to go before it reaches you?",1349308800,4,412,4.9855072463768115

8529487,1,B008PDAFKY,This documentary is very biased to one viewpoint and doesn't do justice to this issue. I wish they had taken time to collect data from animal shelters and show some analysis by an expert (preferably a neutral to the issue) to show whether BSL makes sense. I have a Rottweiler mix and if you interview me I will never be against Rottweilers. Documentaries should try to reach the objective truth or just show the exact state of affairs and not have an agenda in itself.,1515888000,,468,4.517647058823529
8529488,5,B008PDAFKY,"This documentary is so moving. I teared up when we heard about Coco's story. I currently own a pit bull mix and my brother owns her sibling. Freya looks like a collie while Titus looks like a pit. The very thought of someone coming in to take them or Titus away breaks my heart. I am grateful to live in Texas where BSL is banned. My two pit mixes, and many others I have known, are sweet dogs who would sooner lick you to death than ever have the passing thought of attacking you. People in this documentary are right; it is the fault of the owner, not the dog. People who don't take the time to train their dogs or understand their dogs are the issue. Don't go around just throwing blanket blame over a certain breed; take the time to understand what is going on and realize that any dog of any breed can be vicious.",1515196800,,818,4.1835443037974684

8529491,2,B008PDAFKY,"It doesn't matter if the owner or breed is the problem........bottom line every year people die because this breed is in America.  Of course all dogs can bite right?  Yes of course, but numbers don't lie.  Pit bulls have killed or maimed far more than any other breed period. Google search pit bull attacks and you will be reading a long time. Bottom line you can sugar coat this issue all you want, but this year innocent children and adults will die or be severely injured because this breed is still legal.  It doesn't matter what pet animal it is........if hundreds of people are being injured and dozens dying its time to reassess priorities. I love animals, but people before pets. Some smart person is thinking how to refute this and say something like people or cars kill more each year we should get rid of them.  Yes of course, but the issue is necessary vs unnecessary.  Cars and people are necessary for living in US....but pit bulls are not. Its too bad too bc I have no doubt there are many great and harmless pit bulls. But when lives are stake we have to asses probability not people's personal taste. You can live without a pit bull buy something safe.",1502582400,2,1169,4.516587677725118
