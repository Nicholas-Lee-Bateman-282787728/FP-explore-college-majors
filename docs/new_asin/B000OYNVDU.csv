8494820,5,B000OYNVDU,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Interesting ep on two fronts. First, with the exception of the Turtle Lady in one of the later seasons, I don't think I've ever seen anybody as fixated on having a motif on every piece of her clothing as actress Michaela was with the flames. I mean, what in the what, girl!? But it was fascinating watching S and C extinguish her old wardrobe and then actually ramp up her hotness. The technical advice they gave while getting her into much better outfits was clearly explained and very helpful. Second, this might have been Nick's best work. He took Michaela's damaged hair, with its sewn-in extensions, and gave her a FANTASTIC shorter cut, all the while trying to explain what he was doing AND keep her calm. It was pretty intense, and I'm still not even sure if he thought he could pull it off, but he did an awesome job.
3) However, I would be remiss if I didn't again mention the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
