for the children.",1426982400,2,168,4.28125
6938064,5,B00S0DW2RI,"This is definitely worth a watch if you're into slice of life shows and ponies. I still remembered when I first saw it on TV years ago. It immediately filled the void in my heart that was left because the local TV station cancelled Arthur. It was too good to last for sure, but I did eventually track the entire series down on four DVDs and imported them (the DVDs were only released in Australia). Now that it's getting an official region 1 DVD release as well, I'm actually smiling at the thought of getting to see these ponies again.",1426982400,,536,4.37
6938065,5,B00S0DW2RI,"I've been waiting for this to finally be put on DVD. I remember watching this as a kid and my girls have grown up loving MLP as well.

This isn't a watered down version of equestria girls...this came first. The original series, and especially MLP The Movie (it's the smooze!) will always be the best of all the MLP series, but Tales is far from being the worst. Friendship is Magic is good, I admit, but having grown up with the original series (it will always be my favorite), and then Tales, I can't help but be excited to finally have them all on DVD. The Original, Tales and Friendship are all good, but they are in different styles so comparing them isn't fair to any of them. There are those who are huge fans of Friendship (Bronies and all) and there are those who have been MLP fans since the 80's. Either way, isn't the point of all of thrm to provide enjoyment? I think they all succeed. Even the cartoons that came between Tales and Friendship. Although I admit I was not a fan of that reboot (the cartoon or toy).",1424044800,17,1025,4.310880829015544
6938066,4,B00S0DW2RI,"It's a good show, but why isn't Bright Eyes on the cover? I can live with Melody being missing, but not Bright Eyes? She's Best Pony! Her being missing is a disgrace. But, uh, still. Good show.",1421625600,2,193,4.243243243243243

6938103,5,B00S0DW2RI,"I am still on the first (of two) DVDs, with two entire episodes (2 within each television episode, so a total of 4) left on that one.  I sat and watched Slumber Party through Shop Talk (5 full episodes, 10 total) with my four-year-old nephew in one sitting today.  I created a new MLP fan!!  He was walking around behind me saying, ""I like Little Pony Tales Pony!""  Haha, we have to work on the name, but I have converted him!
I grew up on this series, as well as the one from the late 80s.  The classics.  And it kills me how they have mutilated the series into what is currently showing on television today.  The characters look weird, and I have heard (because I could not watch more than one episode of the new show) that it is much more shallow than it used to be.  So I could not be more glad when I found this (as well as the previous series) on DVD.  This is the type of show that I grew up on.  This is the type of show I want my nephew to see (okay, he does not have to watch designated ""girl"" shows, but I'm making a point here!  Earlier T.V. series are better!).
If you were a fan when you were younger of MLP, BUY THIS!!
If you think you COULD be a fan of MLP, BUY THIS!!
If you are younger and are a fan of the current MLP, BUY THIS!!  (And see why the originals are always better)
And if you have a little girl in your life, BUY THIS!!
You will NOT be sorry. :)",1457222400,4,1376,3.9456521739130435

6938119,5,B00S0DW2RI,Born in 87' I'm a huge fan of the fantasy genre! I remember always loving My Little Pony Tales even more than the original series. This used to come on the Disney channel right before Fraggle Rock and I always anticipated watching it! I'm so happy to have it after so many years of waiting!,1443916800,3,290,4.290909090909091

My daughter loves all 3 now (we're just not big fans of G3) If you have a pony lover, there's a good chance they'll love these episodes too.",1441497600,,286,4.218181818181818
6938122,5,B00S0DW2RI,"I am a 24 year old Brony and I really love these series, especially after watching it on Dailymotion (another Internet video website like YouTube) and I love the characters in it and yes even the stuck up tough guys who are chicken, but won't admit it. The animation is A multiple plus and I especially enjoy seeing the commercial break announcements in every episode. I did not watch MLP until I was 23 last year or this year (2015). I got this from Target and I had LOTS of fun having it on DVD (and still do). I mean what more can I say? It's just good fun! No complaints! Just too cute for words! If you love almost anything that's nostalgic, then you're in for a treat! MLP and MLP Tales ROCK!",1438387200,,698,4.2164179104477615

6938124,5,B00S0DW2RI,So excited that this is finally out! Ive had some old bootleg copies of this I bought on e-bay many years ago. I remember this show on the Disney channel in the early 90's. Its fun to introduce it to my kids and they love My Little Pony Tales and the Original My Little Pony episodes.,1433635200,2,284,4.089285714285714
6938125,4,B00S0DW2RI,"great for the nostalgia, but I didn't remember the ponies being so psychotic.

Maybe that's the wrong word, but anything else that comes to mind is an expletive. They are mean. I can say that. They are really crappy friends to each other... I don't know what kind of message they were trying to send, but I missed it way back then.

Maybe I didn't.  I should ask my friends if I was a piece of crap to them back then ^_^  I might have been paying more attention than I thought.",1433203200,4,477,4.1521739130434785
6938126,5,B00S0DW2RI,One of The Best buys yet if your grand daughter loves my little pony this is the one to buy..she watches these every day and she is two almost three now she has a pony case and ponies too adorable.,1432598400,,197,3.95
6938136,5,B00S0DW2RI,I adore this series of My Little Pony. I love all the ponies. Bright Eyes is my favorite though. I love the stories and the animation. I prefer this animation to the G4 one. My Little Pony Tales along with the original 1980's My Little Pony are the best ones in my opinion. There are 26 half episodes in 13 full episodes. The series is very enjoyable and the price is cheap for it. The picture quality is very good for how old this show is. There is also 1 extra on this set. A few of the songs with singalong. I wish Melody and Bright Eyes were on the cover though. All in all an awesome set for an awesome price.,1432512000,,614,4.040983606557377

Starlight doesn't look right..
:-/",1432252800,2,169,4.151515151515151
6938138,5,B00S0DW2RI,"This is the best quality and most complete release that My Little Pony Tales has ever had in the US.  Never before has the complete series been released.  Other than a collection of six episodes released on DVD, the series was only available on heavily-degraded circulated VHS tapes with 20 years worth of haze obscuring everything.  This DVD set, however, is crystal clear.  the episodes have been arranged in their original two-part episode format, and it even includes the television bumpers used in broadcast.  For anyone who is a fan Tales this is a must-buy set!

In terms of the actual show, it is definitely not a fantasy adventure like the original series was but does have its own charms.  The series is slice-of-life with a focus on the everyday lives of seven young friends with a very Archie Comics-esque feel.  Don't expect high adventure like in the 80s show or in some episodes of Friendship is Magic, but it's definitely worth a watch.",1432080000,8,952,4.762195121951219

6938140,5,B00S0DW2RI,Classic series indeed !,1430611200,,23,5.0
6938141,5,B00S0DW2RI,"Just got mine in the mail today and watched half of the series in a single sitting. The DVD set does not disappoint at all, as it includes all 26 episodes, combined into 13 television-slot sized episodes like I am assuming was done when it originally aired in 1992. The picture quality is outstanding, and I really love how they kept the show's original 4:3 TV resolution, as it fits perfectly on my tv.

The sound is perfect as well, and overall I cant help but recommend this to anyone who loves retro MLP. A really nice touch that I noticed is that they kept the commercial break lead-ins as well. No cool special features other than a sing-along mode for the songs, and the case/cover isn't super sturdy, but all in all its a great DVD release.",1430352000,,748,4.420289855072464
6938142,5,B00S0DW2RI,"This is the best mlp ever made! In between shows it even shows old parts of commercials! The quality it great, the picture is great, the sound is great! I couldn't wait till this released and now that I finally got it and have watched it, its beyond my expectations!!!!!!",1430352000,,271,4.44
6938143,2,B00S0DW2RI,"This is not the complete series, This has 13 episodes and the complete series has 26 episodes.",1430265600,3,94,4.588235294117647
6938144,5,B00S0DW2RI,Outside of FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC this MLP series that aired on Disney was my favorite and the DVD set even include the commercial bumpers.  There are many bits that are the same between the two series like episode THE WINNER IN has Clover having two tickets and too many friends to give the extra ticket too like Twilight in Ticket Master.  Both MLP tales and Friendship is magic has a slumber party during a storm episode.  I love Melody and the Rockin Beats group that makes me think of a ponified Jem and Holograms.  The stories are made up of 15 minute episodes much like many of the Cartoon Network shows of today do. You can either watch two 15 minutes episodes together when you click on first of the two or if you want to watch just 2nd of the two you can.  The stories may lack the fantasy elements of Generation one or Friendship is Magic but the stories are very good in their own right as good today as when I first watched it.,1430265600,7,937,4.271186440677966
6938145,5,B00S0DW2RI,"My favorite My Little Pony series.
The 10th year of G1 saw the video release of Firefly's Adventure, as well as a new look at Ponyland in My Little Pony Tales.
G1 went out with a bang! This show presents how unfair the world can really be, with boys pretending to like you just to find out your secrets before they break your heart. This series covers serious topics like blackmailing, racism, egoism, and jealousy. It's a little deep for young kids, and it's a little tame on the jokes for adults, but it's sure to leave you wanting more and wishing there had been a fourth season of G1.",1428278400,5,588,4.3545454545454545

8696738,4,B00S0DW2RI,"Overall, I'm glad that I could get the entire show on DVD because I love it so much, but I just have to say it, they couldn't possibly pick a worse case design. I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to put all those holes there that make it look like a spoked wheel, but it nearly ruins its primary purpose of protecting the DVDs inside. On top of just simply feeling like it was about to crack in your hand like an eggshell and, you know, making the DVDs more exposed to external factors (and on the sensitive side, too) it just makes it so easy to accidently poke holes in the paper cover. See the attached picture, it already had one hole before I even unpacked it, and it only stayed at one because I'm extremely careful with it (sorry for bad quality of the picture btw) On the plus side, though, I really like the custom cover art, although I think it's a crime that they left out two best ponies (and what is the G3 logo doing there?) In conclusion, the only real flaw here is the awful DVD case, if it wasn't for that, I'd give it 5/5, because it certainly deserves it.",1526169600,,1080,4.172248803827751

8696740,5,B00S0DW2RI,"I grew up with all of the original pony shows so I am a bit biased in that regard. The good news is the transcoding looks bright on this DVD set and I love watching these because of it. Don't get me wrong the show is still as sugary sweet as it was when I saw it and im not saying that because im a male, it's just a fact, I would still recommend sharing this with your children. It's lighthearted. Check out the original series.",1515542400,,429,4.0
