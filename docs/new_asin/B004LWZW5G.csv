4406456,3,B004LWZW5G,"The movie starts out as a bad sex comedy. Jonah Hill stars as Noah Griffith, a slightly nerdy, obese young adult who peddles a bicycle. In the opening scene he is performing oral services for a pretty blond girl (Ari Graynor) who believes fat guys do it best, however she won't return the favor as she claims she has a touch of food poisoning. She is a coke slut loved by Noah.

Mom (Jessica Hecht) coerces Noah into babysitting for the neighbor (Erin Daniels). The kids are a 13 year old boy with responsibility issues, an eight year old girl going on 16, and an adopted kid from El Salvador who acts like he is part of a cartel. Noah is irresponsible as this turns into an ""Adventures in Babysitting"" adult comedy as he attempts to score some cocaine for his ""girlfriend"" who has promised him real sex in return.

As I watched the movie for the first time, I had the feeling I have seen this before. Predictable, trite, and mostly unfunny. A ""me-too"" comedy. A lower tier rental at best. Go watch Harold and Kumar instead.

F-bomb, sex talk, no nudity",1324857600,,1053,4.44559585492228
4406457,4,B004LWZW5G,"This movie was about what I was expecting, and it was good. It had some very funny moments, and my style of comedy. Jonah Hill stars as a slacker named Noah Griffith who is forced to babysit Slater, a sexually confused teenager. Blithe, the sassy little girl that wears makeup and wants to party. And finally Rodrigo, an adopted rebellious foreign exchange student. When his girlfriend offers him sex, he takes the kids out on a wild and crazy night of drug-dealers, crazy car chases, and much more. I would definitely recommend THE SITTER!!!",1323734400,7,542,4.776595744680851
4406458,1,B004LWZW5G,"So let's get this straight: The Sitter is about to be released featuring the round and portly Jonah Hill we've become familiar with over the years, but he's lost a considerable amount of weight and almost looks like a completely different person these days? That won't be confusing to some people at all. Truth be told, I liked Jonah Hill there for awhile. I laughed really hard at Superbad, Grandma's Boy was a lot better than it first let on, and Get Him to the Greek was pretty solid as well. Not to mention How to Train Your Dragon being spectacular. The problem is outside of films like Moneyball, Hill basically has Vince Vaughn syndrome and plays the exact same character in everything. It could come down to character acting, but it gets to the point where you see somebody do the same shtick a dozen times and you just want to see if they're capable of anything else. Director David Gordon Green is on the same boat. I keep hearing how solid his first directorial efforts are and Pineapple Express is one of the best R-rated comedies in recent years, but everything since has just been so disappointing. The Sitter won't be the film to shatter what you've come to expect from Jonah Hill and David Gordon Green either.

You pretty much already know the basic story of the film: a guy who hates kids has to babysit three of them and everything you could possibly imagine to go wrong does in the worst ways imaginable. Blithe (Landry Bender) is a little girl who's obsessed with becoming a celebrity and just wants to go to clubs, dress up, wear make-up, drink and eat whatever famous people consume, and sing along to songs a girl her age probably shouldn't. Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) is the adopted kid of the family and likes to destroy things for no reason while having a particular fascination with cherry bombs. Then there's Slater (Max Records) who is convinced he can't function without the medication in his fanny pack since he thinks he's beyond repair.

The Sitter becomes very predictable. The three kids constantly clash with their babysitter throughout the film until they eventually warm up to each other and go from there. Jonah Hill spits out a few semi-entertaining one-liners amongst all the mayhem. There are several weird bonding scenes between the kids and Noah though. Noah has a heart to heart talk with both Blithe and Slater, but Slater is the one to step in and try to set Rodrigo straight. The scenes come off as a little awkward because they feel kind of forced. There's a drug dealer named Karl (Sam Rockwell) chasing them and Noah is trying to get to a party to try and get lucky with his sort-of girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor). Would you take a time-out to make a kid feel better if you owed a drug dealer ten grand by midnight with your life on the line?

The entire adventure becomes incredibly clich and is basically an R-rated version of most of the babysitting movies you've seen previously. Despicable Me, Mr. Nanny, Bebe's Kids, and The Pacifier are probably a few that come to mind. This is another movie whose unrealistic qualities snowballed as it progressed. It continued to get more and more ludicrous as it went on. About halfway into the movie, most of the theater was in hysterics but the entire press row was just not laughing at all. Realizing this made me laugh harder than any material in the movie.

The Sitter is just bad from all angles. It uses a recycled and overused storyline, isn't funny, is unrealistic, and is basically an embarrassment for all of those involved. How in the world did Sam Rockwell become a part of this and what the hell happened to David Gordon Green? The Sitter is the type of movie that lets you know several talented people are involved in the project and yet they still churn out run of the mill garbage to try and make a buck. This is hands down one of the worst movies of the year.",1323302400,5,3873,4.584415584415584

4407237,3,B004LWZW5G,"This is a no brainer comedy that you won't be disappointed watching if you aren't expecting too much. Jonah Hill plays Noah Griffith who plays a loser that babysits for her moms friend in order for her mom to go on a date. He babysits 3 kids: oldest is anxiety ridden closeted gay, adopted roughneck from Columbia, and a little girl who acts like Paris Hilton. Antics ensue when he takes the kids with him to score drugs for a girl at a party that is using him. The car gets stolen, the adopted kid sets cherry bombs in toilets and steals coke from the dealer and Noah needs to find the money to pay the dealer back. During the night Noah finds a girl who likes him for who he is and solves the personal issues of the kids. Movie obviously needs you suspend belief in reality, but it also is truly annoying because the sentiment is fat guys can score pretty girls if they just look around and see the people that truly is worth their time. This happens in all these comedies: the main character is always unsavory and theres ALWAYS a pretty girl that he is oblivious to while chasing the wrong girl. I get that reality does not mirror all films but if fat losers are watching these comedies than the poor saps will always be misled.",1392595200,,1232,4.314655172413793

She's at best 11 years old when this film was shot and Jonah Hill's character often says swear words right in front of her.  Way too much foul language for a film called The Sitter.  I think I read the budget for this film was $25,000,000.00 but yet it made less than $35,000.00.  Now we know why.  Do not waste your time of this.

I am not a huge fan of comedies, in fact, most of the films people consider to be the funniest movies of all time, I didn't like. Hill's films are one of the exceptions. I have to see every movie he is in because he is truly hysterical and makes everything he is in exceptional. The sitter didn't have a very strong plot, but it was a hysterical movie that worked because of Hill. Everyone around him just follows his lead and plays off his energy and it was evident here. Hill along with three kids he's babysitting go on an unbelievable and hysterical adventure in NYC. It's one of those films you don't believe and that initial comes across as stupid, but it's also a film you can't stop watching because you want to see what happens next. Hill was fantastic, the three kids were great, and for once I actually enjoyed a comedy with Sam Rockwell in it.

4407577,4,B004LWZW5G,"It's surprising to me there's so many negative reviews for the Sitter.  It's basically a continuation of a famous comedy babysitting movie from the 80's called the Adventures In Babysitting.  I was a huge fan of this movie back in the late 80's and watched it at least 4 or 5 times.  However the biggest difference is that the Sitter is WAY more crude.  Both the babysitter and the children themselves are responsible for constant inappropriate behavior.  Of the 3 kids, the girl is obsessed with looking mature, acting like an adult by wearing tons of make-up and speaking twice her age, the one boy is really secluded and has anxiety attacks all the time which makes him incredibly nervous around people, and the third kid likes to be a vicious (aka, pesky) silent assassin in a methodical and elaborate kind of way by blowing up toilets and bathrooms.  Together with the babysitter, several regrettable situations occur.

What happens is that the babysitter (played by Jonah Hill) is talked into babysitting these kids one night, and when he receives a phone call from a woman who he believes is his girlfriend, he gets excited and decides to take the kids around town and basically goes on an adventure all the while finding himself in really unfortuate, embarrassing and hilarious situations that he has no control of.  The kids actually make the storytelling that much better.  To give one example, Jonah takes the little girl into the clothing section so she can try on clothes, however the women working there quickly become suspicious that a grown man is walking through a little girls clothing store thanks to several lines that would unintentionally imply that he's up to no good, so the women confront and question him about it.  Really clever and funny writing here.

The way the babysitter connects with the kids near the end is a subtle touch of emotional honesty that I greatly admire, though it might appear tacky and out of place for others, I admit.  Overall, it's certainly not the Adventures In Babysitting from a comedy or storytelling perspective, but it's a decent film at any rate with a touch of offensive laughter here and there.",1348963200,,2156,4.813008130081301
4407578,3,B004LWZW5G,"Not a bad movie. At least it was R rated and was funnier than an Apatow movie and an Adam Sandler movie.

I thought Danny Mcbride was in this film but Sam Rockwell from Iron Man 2 is in here playing a drug dealer with a bodybuilder gang. Pretty weird but it was different. Jonah Hill is way funnier and entertaining playing the fat version instead of the skinny,yet still loser version like he did in 21 jumpstreet.

I feel like the marketing made this out to be a hardcore, extremely raunchy comedy. It is an adult comedy but it isn't as extreme as some comedies out there. Actually, the story even mixes in some issues that kids have at a young age and has Jonah Hill tackling them in a (mostly) mature way. I thought it was a funny movie and it went by really fast, because it's short and thoroughly entertaining. The acting was fine.

It was somewhat predictable and had slightly obvious ending, though. It may feel like you've seen this movie before because it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other ""bring-something-to-the-party-and-get-'rewarded'"" comedies. And some jokes weren't really funny.

Overall, the price was right and it had a good amount of laughs. Ultimately, if you're a fan of Jonah Hill or looking for a decent comedy, I recommend checking out The Sitter.

4407733,4,B004LWZW5G,"Most of the reviews here come from such an diametrically opposite perspective to my own that I'm uncertain of what to write, but write I must.  What I will write is that I've seen young kids dealing with their sexuality and their parents, I've seen an 8 year old with an eating disorder, I grew up in an urban Southern California city with racial tensions part of the taste of the atmosphere, ... I will stop at this time for brevity.  For me what transpired in this movie while filled partially with fantastical tales is not that so far away from what I can relate to.

Would it have been better if the protagonist instead had unrequited love that didn't include vaginal intercourse?  I personally don't think so.  In fact it added quite an appreciated modern nuance to just this story.  Is sex gross?  Is it meant to be put on a pedestal and we are to forget how sexual transmitted diseases happen in our society, how marriages are broken, and how these images effect our children?  Anyone who thinks this is trite commentary on American culture is forgetting what it's like to grow up in this age.

There appear to be a number of criticisms in other reviews dealing with the seemingly care free manner in which ethnicity, sexuality is expressed or dealt with.  My only response is that I'm genuinely appreciative of a movie themed with the premise that regardless of the ills of this society there is a resolution that doesn't require a solicitous nature to truly ""deal"" with these issues .  In general life is not meant to be difficult, but in my perspective it is meant to be accepted for what it is, rather than what it is not.

So to express my distaste in such extreme reactions to this movie I will simply express observations.  There is still racial tension.  There is still a greater than 50% divorce rate in the US.  There are pretentious hypocritical fathers who have no right to effect their progeny in the way they do.  This movie is lighthearted, self consciously stereotypical but it isn't stupid.  It is jocular but it isn't devoid of sincere content.

People are so keen on criticizing what is superficially obscene without a desire to look one step further.  Note this is also a comedy and so the message comes in the farcical, and for such a movie it does a very good job.",1341360000,,2293,4.548780487804878

4407773,5,B004LWZW5G,"I thought this movie was hilarious.  Usually, Jonah Hill does nothing for me.  He's not usually funny and his delivery is just not good.  However, this movie is not your typical Jonah Hill flick.  Jonah stars as Noah, a college dropout with nothing on his plate.  Noah is volunteered by his mother to babysit for her friends so she can go out and meet a potential lover.  The three kids Noah has to babysit are a proverbial nightmare.  You have the middle schooler who's addicted to anti-anxiety medication, the six year old who wants to be a popular socialite and the middle school aged, South American foster child who likes to play with explosives.  Noah must take these kids into the city to buy his girlfriend some drugs, and the movie goes from there.

The twist and turns this movie throws are completely uncharted, and are not easy to see coming.  The language is very, VERY strong, so this is not a kid movie at all (why anyone would think it was is beyond me, but you never know).  The humor is great.  Jonah Hill really steps up to the plate here and hits a home run.",1338940800,,1078,4.416243654822335
4407774,3,B004LWZW5G,"At first I thought this was just a cash grab for Jonah Hill, a continued parlay off of his Superbad success. This movie looked horrible. Ultimately, however, it ended up being a foul Adventures in Babysitting.  In other words, fairly uninspired, clich&eacute;d, and contrived, but just enough crude humor to satisfy some.

I'm far from a prude; my sense of humor is legendarily foul. I laugh at things that make other people cringe and/or cry. But there just weren't a ton of laughs in this film about a slovenly slacker getting played by a female crackhead who wants him to bring drugs to a party, which just happens to put him - and the three kids he's ""babysitting"" - into all sorts of bizarre situations (e.g. car theft, street fights, shoplifting, drugs, toilet bombs). Adding in the loser bequeathed life-lessons just makes the movie sloppy when he's dealing with possibly offensive black and Hispanic stereotypes, forced sexual identity concepts that just added awkwardness to the film (side note: Max Records, who plays Slater, the psychiatrist's wet dream with sexual identity issues, is either a horrible actor or channeling Kristen Stewart. Either way, the fact the actor portraying the role didn't have the maturity required to tackle the complexity further validates the accusation of awkwardness.), and a little girl who is obviously used as a tongue-in-cheek shot at the reality-star generation (side note 2: The little girl in this role, Landry Bender, was actually quite cute and capable.) - it also doesn't help that Hill's transformative process feels unnatural. The shoe-horned love interest subplot was so painful I passed a kidney stone for relief.

I have to admit I laughed more than one time, but I honestly can't remember the situations. So the laughs couldn't have been that hard. Fans of Jonah Hill should rent immediately. Detractors should provide a wide berth.",1338854400,,1891,5.07395498392283

4407829,1,B004LWZW5G,"I actually stuck it out rather than just shut off the DVD as this just seemed more at being stupid rather than funny.  It's a joke how children under 17 need to be accompanied by parents to get into the movie theater or to buy it at the store but yet you have kids under 17 (even 13) cussing and carrying on like ill-behaved adults.  Shame on many parents of today who can't raise decent children - and oh how we complain about crappy music - and would allow them to be cast in movies like this!  It was bad enough back in the 1980s with ""Stand By Me"" having foul-mouthed kids way under 17 but yet kids under 17 needed to be accompanied by parents to view such.

Enough with getting off onto another subject, this movie was not funny, it's stupid and insulting.  Furthermore, it's a rip-off of ""The Adventures of Babysitting"".  The main character comes off as a complete idiot rather than someone who is funny and I hate how he tries to be the ""wise old man"" with the kid who ""has serious issues"".

I'll admit that when I was younger to hear someone drop the F bomb would stun me. But in today's world with today's films it's become rather pass&eacute;.

Jonah Hill, who took a step forward when he went from the crude teen comedies he was making to star in MONEYBALL, takes two steps back with THE SITTER. Hill stars as Noah Griffith, a loser who lives with his mother, has no future planned and would rather be stoned than anything in the world. With the exception of having Marisa as his girlfriend. Marisa uses Noah for oral sex and nothing else, leading him to believe they have a connection when in truth she lusts after the local MMA star.

Wanting the best for his mother, Noah agrees to baby sit for her best friend while she goes out on a date that has bright prospects. Of course the kids are far from normal. Slater is a psychiatrist dream with so many problems that he can't think straight. Blithe is a wanna be celebrity elementary schooler. And that leaves Rodrigo, the adopted son of the family who has a penchant for blowing things up.

Noah gets a call from Marisa while sitting: pick up some cocaine and rush over to a party she's at and she might have sex with him. Being the responsible sitter he is, Noah packs the kids in the car and off they go to find the money to buy drugs and then deliver them.

Of course they end up doing nearly everything but with adventures involving robbing Noah's father's diamond business, dropping into an all black bar and running afoul of the drug dealer when Rodrigo steals a large plastic egg filled with drugs. The dealer gives Noah a few hours to recover the drugs or the money.

If you think this sounds like a twisted version of the classic ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, you'd be right. But unlike that movie which had more than its share of funny situations and laughs, this movie relies on the lowest common denominator of jokes to attempt to squeeze jokes out. And it fails almost every time.

While I watched I kept hoping that funny things would happen. There were a few rare occasions when they did but those were short lived. Instead I got more of the foul language in front of kids (or used by kids, something Hollywood thinks is funny these days) and references to drugs and sex that helped to create the worst years in the history of SNL, that period of time which never makes it to reruns on any channel.  These items are not funny just because you toss a lame joke at them.

Late in the movie Noah suddenly seems to care about the kids he's watching. But it comes far too late and out of nowhere. The entire time he spends with these kids at first seems like he's there to earn some money and help his mom. Before a few hours are over, he suddenly wants to help these kids find their place in life, something even he hasn't achieved. Not only does it make an unbelievable situation, it makes the film seem more awkward than helpful.

First off if you refer to this movie in the number of acts, this movie isn't for you.  If you like Jonah Hill's movie then you'll love this one.  Yes, his movies are a little vulgar and raunchy, but it good fun and Jonah doesn't pretend to be anything he's not.  If you are not a fan of Jonah, this film still has a decent plot (much like Super Bad) and has a better message.

You watch 4 kids (Jonah included) deal with little problems that are made into big deals but none other than themselves.  As the characters grow and spend time with each other they learn from each other.  Enemies become friends and realize that there are much bigger problems out there and that they need to deal with their problems instead of ignoring them and making them worse. It's well written, with good direction and that is why I gave it 4 stars. It is a good comedy with a good story.

4407995,1,B004LWZW5G,"... and NOT, unfortunately, in a good way. This movie is everything I can't stand about the current status of an insipid, needlessly profane and uninspired Hollywood. First off, you've likely already seen ""The Sitter,"" even if you've never seen it. What do I mean? This movie borrows... no, flat-out PLAGIARIZES many other (and far better) films that have preceded it. ""Adventures in Babysitting"" being the most obvious, of course. I have my issues with the big studios cutting corners, rushing projects and releasing titles the world could clearly do without, but let's face it: America is at its least educated state, yet. And unfortunately, that seems to come with the acceptance of a film like this. The humor is crude and not funny, the dialogue is contrived and weak and the ""acting"" is a joke (the actors didn't even seem to take this one seriously - it's as if the movie was edited together from behind the scenes outtakes where everyone is just playing around). Now, I love comedies. And I can enjoy the occasional odd-humored, socially-awkward-nitwit-who-has-lessons-to-learn kind of a movie. But this crosses the line. Namely, the content the young child actors are exposed to in this film is simply reprehensible. If you are a parent and you're okay with the type of behavior, jokes and language that are exposed to the kids here, then this review is not for you. I am talking to the people out there who still possess some semblance of class and morality. Because this script, quite frankly, was written for trash to enjoy. It's not as if anything in the movie was original or clever in any way, just rehashed ideas rolled in the gutter and served up as new. Mmmmm... delicious. But not really. By the way, I'm not a religious person or even a parent, so don't write me off as a ranting ""nut"" who can't hack some lewdness in his cinema. I love some dirt and grit in my movies, but it has to be well done. ""Godfather,"" anyone? Anyway, I agree with the 'Booklover' review posted here, as well as a few others. Tell Hollywood you're not going to settle for this crap by not watching or purchasing it.

MY ADVICE: You wanna watch a well-written, well-acted version of this film in which the big, clueless, but ultimately lovable oaf-of-a-man unwittingly becomes the caretaker of children? Complete with indelible characters and truly funny dialogue? GO WATCH ""UNCLE BUCK."" Now THAT'S
a comedy. And your kids could enjoy it with you.  :)",1335139200,,2445,4.777777777777778

All the other subplots (girlfriend, drug dealer, new potential girlfriend, father, old high school acquaintance with a grudge)seem very false and contrived as does the third, adopted, child - his role is completely a waste, unfunny, probably racist and totally unrealistic. The other two kids were likeable enough behind terrible scripting. I don't blame Jonah Hill, he was reasonably funny, he just didn't have much to work with.

4408115,4,B004LWZW5G,"Out of college - not voluntarily and not due to graduation - Noah Griffith is spending his time at home, in his mom's house, pretty much doing nothing. Sitting back and watching TV is enough for him - with the occasional trip out to his 'girlfriend's' house.

When his mom's night out is threatened after her friend's babysitter cancels, Noah hates to see her disappointed, but kids are not his thing. Still, a few hours with a couple of kids can't be worse than his mom not having the chance to meet a great guy . . . can it?

Neither Noah nor the kids expect the wild night they're about to have.

Noah (Jonah Hill) has a 'girlfriend' and that term should be used loosely, Marissa (Ari Graynor) whose call with the promise of sex . . .  if you know, Noah does some things besides drive downtown (with the kids she doesn't know he's babysitting) set the whole night into motion. Of course, it's not just what she says that makes everything happen, or Noah's attempts, it's what she asks, how he goes about it, where he has to go, what happens along the way, and how everything plays out.  Which is all incredibly funny.

I wanted to see this movie because it looked funny - raunchy and crazy, yet but funny. What I didn't know was that it would have some depth if not (and don't fault it for this) heart, too.

The kids are rather archetypal, but not the kind that's usually seen portrayed. The little girl, Blithe (Landry Bender) wants to be a celebutante, wears a ton of makeup and is waayyy too into songs with lyrics inappropriate for someone her age (maybe anyone's age). There are a lot of girls (really young ones) who are into looking older, wearing makeup, etc right now. Her character and the reaction to her fit.

It's not a deep, dramatic movie so there's not big, epic scenes of emotion, but I thought the little bits (mostly wit the kids) that were put in there were nice and still fit within  the story.

Overall, it's a very funny movie - even more so than I expected - there's enough just random stuff in it to keep it from being predictable even if all of it isn't the most original story line ever. It's one I'll definitely watch again.",1332979200,,2156,4.380952380952381

I love Jonah Hill and thought this would be a modern spin on ""Adventures in Babysitting"" or even ""Uncle Buck"", but it's actually boring most of the time. I think the only really interesting thing about it is that Jonah helps one of the kids he's babysitting figure out and come to terms with the fact that he's gay -- that was a surprise the movie went there, and the way it was handled was well-done and beneficial to the kid.  But the rest of the movie feels like it was written over a weekend and the movie was made for $2 million dollars and filmed over the following weekend. I didn't find any of it funny, and I actually felt bad for Jonah Hill because he's usually in much better movies.

Personally, I have learn to avoid anything to do with three-named people. In my experience, they generally fall into two basic camps: Pretentious Egotists or Serial Killers. Besides the screenwriting team, I'm hoping no one disappeared during the making of this moronic production. As to the former - there is no hole deep enough. In reaching for clever and raunchy, they only succeeding in bungling their way to unfortunate and embarrassing.

Proof positive that shallow superciliousness will only carry you so far. 'Pineapple Express' was my first DGG film and I thought, ""Wow, this guy is the Mel Brooks of his generation."" Now after three movie disasters, including this shoddy pile, I recognize that he's actually baseball player Brady Anderson.

Remember him? Probably not. In 1996 he hit an astounding 50 home runs. He never hit more than 21 before that one season and no more than 24 throughout his career afterwards.

A fluke.

Sometimes you just get lucky, it happens. But luck always runs out. And unless you have real talent, there's nothing to fall back on.

Sadly, just as you're almost drawn into Noah as he connects with his youthful charges, those sympathetic moments are completely buried; because as a viewer you no longer care. Having being smacked up the side the noggin' with the imbecilic plot and its fumbling adolescent attempts at being funny, you're too numb to engage. It borders on tragedy because there's a tender strength in lead actor Jonah Hill that comes through when he's in the right vehicle.

Listed as a comedy. But unless you're 15 years old, it takes considerable effort for this to be in any way construed as comedic.

Personal Note: I'm not a fan of Sam Rockwell. In fact, I generally can't stand the weasel-like actor.

4408234,1,B004LWZW5G,"The Sitter manages to be unfunny, predictable, dull and ridiculous all at the same time. It starts badly with Jonah Hill failing to get sex from his coke-addicted girlfriend and quickly scrapes right through the bottom of the barrel to rip off every babysitter film ever made.

The three kids in the film are a collection of two-dimensional problems that make the adults look like Dickensian-crafted characters. The kid from Ecuador think he's from a cartel because - you know - he's South American. Floppy haired anxiety kid is coming to terms with being gay because that's such a great concept for comedy. And celebrity obsessed brat #3 is really annoying. The stereotypes don't stop there - there are some 'gangsta' black people who are really just cool folk in the end too.

Around the end of Act 2 the film is forced to try to reconcile all these situations in some really terribly written scenes that show the kid from Ecuador should be more family oriented and less completely crazy, kid #2 should accept his sexuality (at 12 years old!) and kid #3 has to wipe off the excess make-up. Jonah meanwhile realizes his girlfriend has been using him and hooks up with an arbitrary friend from college who happens to be cocktailing.

The basic problem with the film isn't the absurdity (The Hangover barely makes sense but is a great flick) - it's the fact that there isn't a single laugh in the whole movie. Sam Rockwell limps his way through this and somehow his thorough beating near the end seems out of key with a kid-focused comedy. How this script ever got made is beyond my imagination - if this is all Hollywood has, please keep remaking classics and giving us sequels. I had to rewatch Uncle Buck just to remember what comedy looked like.",1330819200,28,1748,4.6688311688311686
4408235,3,B004LWZW5G,"The Sitter is the worst film of director David Gordon Green's career. In case this doesn't mean much to you, allow me to explain: With a slew of films starting in 2000, Green was on the fast-track to becoming one of America's great directors. In 2008, he branched into the mainstream with the well-received Pineapple Express. Since then, he has delivered two more films, Your Highness and The Sitter; both 2011 releases and both being the worst-reviewed films of his career. Because Your Highness was a passion project for Green and star Danny McBride, I don't fault him for this. The Sitter is just lazy however. Green has not ""sold out,"" having been vocal about wanting to balance his more personal projects with films he enjoyed as a kid. There's nothing wrong with having fun and getting a substantial paycheck that could make it easier for him to make those films he's passionate about. What's wrong is when a director with this much talent attaches his name to a project this mediocre. The Sitter boasts a phenomenal director and a talented star, but is bogged down by lazy, repetitive humor and a lack of coherent writing. It's entertaining if you shut your brain off, but at what cost?

The plot instantly brings to mind the 80s cult classic Adventures in Babysitting, at least, I assume it does considering that was the first film that came to my mind and I haven't seen a frame of it since the late 90s. Jonah Hill, in his final pre-weight loss role, plays Noah Griffith, a college student on suspension roped into babysitting as a favor to his mom. Since this is a comedy, the children must fall into a specific archetype so they can effectively wreak havoc. There is the neurotic, stern Slater (Max Records from Where the Wild Things Are), the makeup obsessed Blithe (Landry Bender), and the adopted, pyromaniac Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez). While the children begin misbehaving and destroying everything in sight, Noah gets a call from his girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor) who says she'll finally sleep with him if he acquires cocaine and brings it to her. Noah and the children pile into a minivan and set off into the night where he'll encounter psychotic drug dealers, gangs, and a mounting wave of stress.

The script by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka follows an episodic template with each new situation getting Noah into more trouble. The plot is recycled and follows a predictable formula, but it's the disconnection between everything that presents the biggest problem. This doesn't feel like a tight, cohesive story but a loose collection of scenes thrown together to create a whole. There's little consistency in the way each scene flows into the next and the script could have benefitted from an additional draft. I doubt the writing was a top priority for anyone involved though. As for the jokes, it may be unfair but I assume the best ones were improvised. I will not apologize or excuse myself for laughing when a valet tells Noah that he's lost his car and Noah responds ""You didn't lose your Morrissey boxset,"" nor will I deny that I chuckled maniacally when Noah tells a character he's ""as queer as a football bat."" The movie has a darker tone than the average mainstream comedy, but seems almost uncomfortable and never really follows through with it. You remember how 80s films of this sort would get pretty dark (Adventures in Babysitting, for example, was pretty dark)? The Sitter seems unwilling to fully make that commitment, probably due to the choppiness of the script.

Without the talent involved, all of whom likely made the film more watchable, this could easily be a direct-to-DVD release and it's a sad day that a film directed by David Gordon Green can be labeled ""amateurish."" I admit I laughed a few times and was never bored watching it, but there's nothing smart or original about The Sitter. What's worse is that the movie has its share of gross-out, double-digit IQ humor that is both unfunny and completely beneath Green as a director. Hill's mounting frustrations dealing with the over exaggerated, devilish children can only keep a movie up and running for so long. On the positive side, the child actors do a fine job and are actually pretty funny. That's more than I can say for the obnoxious, unfunny children in the Adam Sandler-vehicle Just Go with It from earlier this year.

There's nothing pretentious about The Sitter and I'm sure Green was aware it was his worst film while making it. Everyone involved here simply wanted to have fun, get a paycheck, and go home. No one in the target audience for this will be turned off by what they discover herein. The biggest failure of The Sitter is how disappointing it turned out with the people involved. I know Green still has it in him to make a film that will redeem his recent output but I hope it's sooner rather than later. This film would have been disappointing with Brett Ratner directing it; Green's involvement pours salt in the wound.",1328400000,,4955,4.778296382730455
