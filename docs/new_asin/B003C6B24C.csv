8394122,5,B003C6B24C,"Great historical read!!!  I was able to see the USS Constellation in the Baltimore Harbor, along with some other vessels.  It was also, a very cool experience visiting the US Naval Academy where they had a model of the vessel, along with the beautiful coffin of John Paul Jones (""I have not begun to fight!"").  A nice American History book to add to my collection.",1376611200,,364,4.569230769230769
