4406075,1,B004LWZW6U,"I enjoyed the first. It was dumb, senseless fun. This feels like a straight to DVD sequel so I guess it makes sense that it was released worldwide video on demand instead of theaters. The scenes all feel rushed. You will notice several editing mistakes between scenes and none of them ever have a chance to take hold. The trailer really did show the best parts of the movie. I really did give this one a chance in hopes for another ridiculous gory hour and a half but it didn't do it for me. It isn't one of those so bad it's good movies either. It's just bad. Leaves you feeling nothing, frankly. Usually when watching horror movies like this you leave laughing or shaking your head at the craziness. The characters had no clever lines nor interesting subplots. The main character being the piranhas didn't even have much time to shine. Most of the shots were of a shadowy school of them in a muddy lake. Zero tension.

Oh well. Watch it if you don't believe me.

I would however wait for the HD or 3D version though. This streams in 480p.

I assume they released VOD instead of theaters because someone released it would tank on the big screen. So good call there. At least this way people will pay out of sheer curiousity.

This could have been great!",1338508800,6,1254,4.415584415584416

4406104,3,B004LWZW6U,"You don't need to have seen the original film Piranha 3D, to understand or follow anything that happens in this sequel, but it gives away a fair bit of the plot, plus it has a couple of minor characters from that one, so gives away that they survive the first. I'd recommend checking out the Piranha 3D first, if for no other reason than it was simply a much better film.  In this sequel a creepy stepfather (David Koechner) has taken over a decades owned water-park and with 51% ownership, couldn't care less that his stepdaughter doesn't like the direction he's transforming the place, basically turning it into an adult water-park, with stripper life guards, nude bathing complete with crotch cam when ladies use the ladder to get out of the pool. He's also not opposed to bribing the local police and stealing water from an underground water source.  As you can guess that source has more than just water in it.

This sequel clearly doesn't have the budget for either writers, special effects or even camera time (it goes for barely over an hour without the credits), that all the made the first film great.  It's more like Sharknado in cheesiness and non believability than your usual creature attacking humans films like Piranha 3D was. Being Sharknado style isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just a different type of film to the original.  If you don't think David Hasselhoff playing a negative public stereotype of himself as a dumb, diva, hasbeen celebrity is funny, than you're likely to be disappointed with this sequel. I loved his ""little ginger moron"" storyline. Likewise you have to suspend belief such as with a fish flying at someones head being able to swallow that head mid-flight that is bigger than it, a pool triangle ribbons rope being able to decapitate and things like this.

For me enjoyment by the fact the piranhas which had looked plausible to be real prehistoric fish in the first film, was lowered by the fact they look like plastic fake fish in this sequel.  The piranhas in this one were also slower than what we as viewers had established as their norm, from the first film, with people being able to out swim these fish and get to land when you know they wouldn't have made it in the first film.  There is a lot less gore in this film than the original, you expect sequels to have more.  The film really needed to be longer, I expect a movie to at least be around 90 minutes, there were many aspects of a water-park that could have been incorporated with Piranha attacks, such as on watersides which just never are used which easily could have provided more scenes.  Christopher Lloyd's character could have been in it a bit more.",1484265600,,2667,4.643312101910828
4406105,3,B004LWZW6U,i have other piranha movies but this is my first one in 3D.  i have been buying almost every 3D movie i can find.  lets face it i rated this movie with 3 stars because well to be honest youve seen one piranha movie you have seen them all.  not to be blunt or anything the actors aren't bad but its just a boob flick with flesh eating fish.  i gave this movie 2 stars for the boobs and 1 star for the fish.  the script was about whatt you would expect of a movie of this type.  if you took the  women out of this picture it still might be as good as anaconda,1480809600,3,557,3.791304347826087
4406116,3,B004LWZW6U,"Released in 2012 and directed by John Gulager, ""Piranha 3DD"" is the sequel to 2010's ""Piranha 3D"" and is pretty much more of the same, although I like it better. This time the action switches to a waterpark co-owned by cutie Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) in which the highly aggressive prehistoric piranhas invade via sewage pipes, attracted by chemicals involved in swimming pool cleansers that match their spawning routes. Christopher Lloyd returns as the marine expert who officials write off while David Hasselhoff appears as himself, a has-been celebrity making an appearance at the waterpark.

The original 1978 film was a great semi-serious/parody of Jaws-like flicks, but neither of the two recent Piranha flicks have been able to rise to its level. But at least this one is a little better than the somewhat disappointing 2010 movie. While it goes overboard with crudeness (you'll know what I mean) it is genuinely amusing and I found myself busting out laughing on several occasions, especially the last scene before the credits where little Johnny (or whatever his name is) makes the mistake of getting too close to a supposedly dying piranha. The Hasselhoff subplot is hilarious. The movie's entertaining but, at the end of the day, ""Piranha 3DD"" is what it is: a throwaway horror comedy.

The movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in North Carolina with opening shots of Lake Victoria filmed at Salton Sea, California.

4406195,1,B004LWZW6U,"Theres one key fact you need to know about Piranha 3DD.  The original film, Piranha 3D, had a budget of $24 million dollars.  The sequel only had a budget of around $6 million.  And that sounds about right because with only about  of the budget we only get about  of the blood and gore, only  of the double Ds, and only  of the fun.  The direct-to-video sequel loses just about everything that made the original film such a guilty pleasure.  It also lacks the tongue-in-cheek humor of the original, instead giving us an overdose of David Hasselhoff that is neither funny nor interesting.

Set a year later, the town of Lake Victoria, AZ has been completely abandoned after the attacks by the prehistoric Piranha.  Maddy, a marine biologist student, returns home for the Summer to help run the waterpark that she co-owns wither her stepfather Chet.  Unknown to Maddy, Chet has turned part of the waterpark into an adults only attraction featuring a topless bar and strippers who are water certified to act as lifeguards.  When Maddy has an encounter with one of the piranha, she and her friends go to visit crazy Mr. Goodman (once again played by Christopher Lloyd) for help.  Lloyd surmises that the fish have migrated to the new lake through underground caves (isnt that convenient).  And more shocking they are attracted to chlorine treated water which could cause them to get into the towns water system.  Maddy wants to shut the park down since they drain into the lake but Chet will have none of it and goes ahead with the grand opening, serving up all the guests for a meal for the hungry fish.

Even having Ving Rhames back in a cameo role as Deputy Fallon..and even with outfitting his artificial legs with shotguns, cannot save this flat and uninspired sequel.  The original had dozens of some truly creative special effects while the sequel, showing the effects of the miniscule budget, offer little more than the average Syfy Channel film.  Of Course, John Gulager, whose only other directorial efforts were the Feast trilogy films, still felt compelled to give us yet another severed penis scene.

But all this pales next to the agonizing annoyance of David Hasselhoff, playing himself as a guest lifeguard.  I puked a little in my throat when he began running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme, his sagging man-boobs bouncing with such fervor that Pam Anderson would be jealous.  A pity he survives

Piranha 3DD is completely self-aware that it is making complete and utter mindless drivel that makes you lose IQ points each time you watch it...

It is a horror-shock film full of boobs, blood and teens meeting their untimely demise in awful ways - with David Hasselhoff playing himself as icing on the cake - I appreciate the actors here that are willing to lower themselves to this level solely for a paycheck and cheap laughs.

If you like Tokyo Shock films, this is the closest American Equivalent with a moderate budget to hit the mainstream in a while.

4406679,3,B004LWZW6U,"""Piranha DD"" is exactly what you would expect with that title: deadly fish with attitudes invade an adult water park. Questions?

I gave the film three stars, one each for David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd, and Gary Busey, who all did their part to bring this fishy thriller to life. Sadly, the opening scene involves Gary Busey and a farting cow, and does not go well allowing Busey to leave the set early. Would you believe Christopher Lloyd as a mad scientist? His role is more substantial than Busey's, but the big ticket star of the show is David Hasselhoff, who gets a choice part that even features a prophetic line of dialogue, ""Welcome to rock bottom."" Mostly the film stars big-chested women you've never heard of and will likely never hear from again in a plot involving a water park in which the lifeguards have been replaced by strippers.

The plot proceeds about like you'd expect (hyper-smart fish that can pierce solid steel on the warpath against nubile youngsters) and great scenes like the piranha interruptus scene (concluding in a terrible dilemma with a butcher knife,) or my personal favorite moment involving a love van, handcuffs, prayer, and piranhas all adding to a cohesive whole. Diverse plot elements such as a sheriff with a combination prosthetic leg/shotgun and the ultimate (deserved) clotheslining scene in movie history makes this almost as good as an average SyFy aquatic animal feature. For those of you interested in good local governance, there's even a subplot about the high cost of the municipal water supply!

There are a lot of bonus features, including deleted scenes, ""The Story Behind Piranha DD,"" ""The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff,"" and by far the best reason to own the DVD, a short film titled ""A Lesson With John McEnroe,"" which made the remainder of the DVD worthwhile.

Now unlike the first one this movie takes almost everything way to far. In the first one, everything that was done made sense and while some stuff was cheezy I never complained, here I've got all sorts of complaints. What's the deal with Piranha's impregnating a girl? Why does that guy think the girl did something do his blank? Why did you make the brillent Christopher Loyd comic relief when in the last movie he was serious? What happened to the parent Piranha's? And this ending PLEASE? And it's obvious that we aren't going to care about almost every person on this cast so geez.

However I will give this movie two pro's. One I did laugh a lot and two I did care for a couple of the cast namely Maddy, Barry, Shelby and kinda Josh (mainly just his story arch).

This was nothing more then beautiful very well endowed women bouncing around, If you were to combine any after midnight cinemax movie with a syfy channel original you have piranha 3dd . There were not even that many scenes with the piranhas.

I am giving this 2 stars only because of the very fun/funny performance of Mr David Hasselhoff, if the hoff ever made a movie with Bruce Cambell I would be the first to watch.

The Piranha's are back and this time their invading an adult triple X themed water park leaving no cleavage unscathed in their path.
That alone is enough to raise an eyebrow or two but this movie is surprisingly good for what it is.
It never over steps its boundaries and stretches itself thin. It's fun,fast,and manages a few tense moments as well.
The cast is great as well,which features  appearances from David hasselhoff,Gary Busey, and Christopher Lloyd.

The 3D presentation isn't bad either. I'll put it this way, If you want to see girls in Bikinis in 3D (getting eaten by blood thirsty Piranha's no less), this will probably be worth your investment.
Theirs quiet a bit of depth to the films 3D,though a few pop out scenes fall short of expectation with only maybe one or two really grabbing out at you,and even then they leave a bit to be desired.
Piranha 3DD is certainly worth a rental and bluray, and for the price is worth keeping around in your 3D collection. It certainly adds that extra dimension to the film that really helps emerse you in the whole experience.",1361664000,,1142,4.648514851485149

If you thought PIRANHA 3D was in poor taste, you ain't seen nuthin' yet! The creative team behind the cult-classic FEAST takes over in this direct-to-video sequel, and they have really nailed it this time. PIRANHA 3DD shoots way over the top with its crude humor and exploitative fun, throwing political-correctness to the wind along with plenty of limbs and bikini tops. Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way. If that weren't enough, PIRANHA 3DD unleashes the one-and-only David Hasselhoff in a brilliant self-parody for the final act. Any fans who may have been disappointed with the last PIRANHA can get ready for a stupid good time with PIRANHA 3DD!

4406831,3,B004LWZW6U,"The prehistoric flesh-eating fish are poised to attack swimmers again in a waterpark named ""Big Wet"" (with an ""adult-themed"" swimming pool). Believing the danger is imminent, our heroine Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), co-owner of ""Big Wet,"" tries to stop the other co-owner (and her step-father) Chet (David Koechner) from opening the waterpark, but greedy Chet would not listen. This is a time tested formula for making horror movies, but somehow director John Gulager (""Feast"" and two sequels) fails to make full use of it. In short, everything in ""Piranha 3DD"" is weak.

""3DD"" takes too much time explaining what is obvious to most viewers and repeating what the predecessor did, but in less effective way. The sequel, though it has enough gores and some good ideas, looks tamer nonetheless. In the second half the film gets better with bloody mayhem that finally happens, but we still feel we are being short-changed, as the film is neither gory nor funny enough.

Three players from the original, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer and Ving Rhames, come back, but their roles are small and forgettable ones (though I like the final line of Christopher Lloyd's character). David Hasselhoff appears as himself, parodying his own image more than once. It is funny, but the joke just overstays its welcome.

By definition a sequel is destined to be tied to the original, and thus comparison is inevitable. Maybe ""Piranha 3DD"" would have been received more positively had it been released before Alexandre Aja's campy and ultra-gory ""Piranha 3D."" ""Piranha 3DD"" is a mildly amusing horror comedy.

Piranha 3DD is about the same batch of Piranha's that struck in the last movie. Except these can eat through things and are apparently attracted to the smell of chlorine. Because of this and the greedy actions of one man they end up getting into the water supply at a local water park. The water park is run by Maddy and her stepfather, Chet. Maddy is only back for summer vacation and discovers he's changed her family's water park into an adult pool party. Well, partly at least. He's hired a ton of babes for lifeguards. And he's opened an adult's only area of the park where people can drink, be nude and just get wet and wild. Due to this ""Adult Pool"" area of the water park, I fully expected most of the movie to take place in that area as they actually could have done a lot with it. Tons of sex, tons of nudity and comedy, but they didn't go that route. In fact, there was about 7 minutes of that area and the rest was all regular swimmers at the main pool.

While the production values and concept weren't that bad, I was looking for more of the same formula that the first movie brought - Great gore, a little comedy and nudity.

4406899,3,B004LWZW6U,"There are some pretty cruddy kills in this movie but all in all it actually came out decent, the budget for the film was around 5 Million Dollars and I think that it looked better than what they paid for.... Minus the fact that they used shots from the first movie in some scenes and just tinted the color to make it look different. On another note I do like that they used more practical fish effects than CGI ones.... They put a lot of effort into this movie and it does somewhat show on screen

Plot: Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) has just returned to her hometown for college spring break to find out that her idiotic stepfather (David Koechner) has turned her childhood memories into a sexual nightmare, her very own 49% of their waterpark has turned into 51% of the stepfathers own, sensual fantasies. But if that wasn't enough a school of vicious prehistoric Piranha has returned to a new lake located next to the waterpark and her stepfather (being the moron he is) has put a well near the waterpark to get free water which leaves an easy access for the Piranha to enter and cause another massacre!

Review: Some directors like to push the envelope to create something farfetched and still obtain that gross out fun factor, John Gulager is one of those directors who tries so hard to push that seal open and sometimes he succeeds straight up (Feast), but other times he only makes it halfway (Piranha 3DD) and sometimes he nearly demolishes it (Feast 2 and 3). Piranha 3DD is a no-brainer when it comes to entertainment it want's fans and critiques to numb their minds and make fun out of everything on the screen, some fans/critiques unfortunately cannot and I respect that it shows that they want a seriously superb movie. For me I like films of all genres and categories.... Everything from Piranha 3DD to Prometheus. This little flick came out when I was still Piranha Hungry and when I saw the trailer I thought ""yes it is going to be much different in many ways such as the feeling of the movie, the seriousness level (which pretty much was absent in this movie), and the humor tone of the movie! Alexandre Aja created the Perfect and my favorite B-Movie (which was the first 3d remake of Piranha) and he did it with everything in place. There were some scenes in Piranha 3d that genuinely freaked/grossed me out and in Piranha 3DD there is some differences, the top three kills felt truly forced, one of them was impossible and the other acted like something out of a final destination movie. The whole movie felt a bit forced but I can live with it, the question is.... How much can you take un-seriously before giving up?

Acting: Danielle Panabaker, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer, David Koechner, Katrina Brown, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager and even David Hasslehoff were all excellent in their roles.... Especially David Hasslehoff whose character was portrayed perfectly (Hint, he played himself).

Gore: The top three kills that I mentioned earlier involved two decapitations (one impossible and the other funny yet disturbing), and a spear (trident) impalement in the face... the rest we get is a piranha chewing a guy's ass, lots of blood, grisly corpses, a severed hand, and more! It was gory enough, still, I am glad they didn't go extremely farfetched with the gore!

Bottom Line: Double the trouble but double the silliness makes this flick decent in my book. It is on a par with Sharktopus in my opinion and I'm sticking to it. I do hope they make a sequel, there are so many more settings such as a bar, a casino, a school.... The possibilities are endless!

As if you couldn't already tell from the title that this would be stupid. But, I felt why not give it try and paying $5 thanks to Walmart for miss marking it, seemed like I had nothing to really lose.
They tried to be funny, wasn't funny. They tried to make it scary, it wasn't. The saddest part is you would think from the title that there would naked girls running all over the place. To be honest there were, but there was more in the first than this. And this is coming from a gay man, a movie with DD in the title you would expect something more... DD.
The acting, was worst than anything I have ever seen. I would have turned off the movie during that part when the cop from the first was fighting with that ugly guy that was driving the party boat from the first. Then... ""Bring me my legs""... he has shotguns for legs, that seem to have unlimited ammo.

I always thought, that if there were to be a sequel to the first that they would some what follow the sequel to the original. Flying Piranhas, sure it would be kind of stupid, but nothing like this.
I would say, Redbox this movie if you have to see this. Unless you can get it below $10 for 3D, $5 for just blu ray... $1 for DVD. I wouldn't buy it.",1347580800,,1357,4.044609665427509

4407016,4,B004LWZW6U,"This movie is so over-the-top cheesy and gawdawful ridiculous that it will go down in movie history as one of the best worst movies ever made; yet, it's still very, very entertaining. Just thinking about it now makes me chuckle at some of the crazy things that they did in this wacky movie. I mean, it's about prehistoric piranha invading an adult-themed waterpark for crying out loud! You can't get much more zanier than that for a movie premise.

If you are looking for a heart-pounding scary thriller about killer fish than look elsewhere because this sequel is definitely not for you. The first movie wasn't really all that terrifying either, it had it's moments, but it made up for it all with some pretty intense scenes of piranha carnage. This one is just pure piranha cornage.

Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames, and Paul Scheer all reprise their roles from the first one, and Gary Busey, and David Hasselhoff join the cast to help add a new level of cheesiness to this outing, especially David Hasselhoff who hams it up royally and had me laughing out loud more than a few times with his antics.

The 3D was not the best that I have ever seen, but it wasn't bad. It had some good pop-out effects here and there, but not a whole lot of depth to a lot of it. Some scenes looked better in 3D than others. But I'm still glad that I got this 3-disc set for my collection.

The special effects weren't bad either, although nothing in this movie compares to the amazingly gross and gory stuff that Greg Nicotero and his team came up with for the first movie. But this one has some passable effects here and there. And the CGI was very well-done. The piranha looked pretty good, both the CGI and puppet practical effects ones, I thought.

If you are looking for a good time with a wild and wet and crazy movie that does not take itself seriously whatsoever than give this movie a try for some good cheap laughs and thrills.",1347235200,10,1921,4.477142857142857
4407077,1,B004LWZW6U,"Speaking as a fan of writer/director/producer Alexandre Aja, it isn't surprising to be one of the few who stand up for the ""Piranha"" remake. It was more or less as campy as everyone expected and the storyline was ridiculous, but the cast was pretty decent. The special effects were the crown jewel though. While the 3D effects were weak and the computer generated stuff wasn't so great, the practical effects were top notch. The gore was so good and it made a cheesy remake just a little bit better than it should have been.

""Feast"" director John Gulager replaces Aja for ""Piranha DD,"" (the movie drops the 3 from its title on the regular Blu-ray and DVD) the production budget is about a fifth of what it was for the remake, and the cast is mostly filled with unfamiliar faces and washed up stars. Judging by the title and tag line alone, everything is doubled for the sequel. But as you can probably imagine everything goes even more downhill in comparison to the remake, as well. The campiness is magnified 100% and the sequel takes no shame in showcasing nothing but large, fake breasts. All obvious statements that shouldn't be considered bad if utilized properly, but ""Piranha DD"" doesn't exactly blend them together to make a worthwhile concoction.

The 3D effects are atrocious; just bulky and blobby CG that looks like it was sloppily thrown together in minutes. The special effects in general take a huge nose dive from ""Piranha."" The water park sequence tries to recreate the beach mayhem from the remake relocated at a water park and it just fails horribly. The ratio of practical effects to computer generated ones in ""Piranha DD"" is probably somewhere around 25/75 and it just feels cheap because of it.

When the piranhas aren't CG, the fish props look way too big. They're watermelon sized on land, but are small enough to swim up someone's genitalia in the water? In the meantime, the fish are pulling off completely impossible feats like breaking through grates, sheets of metal, and the concrete walls of pools. The result is something that is neither terrifying nor entertaining and is more along the lines of a movie seen on SyFy except without the boundaries of being restricted to cable.

If the horrible fish weren't enough, the people are even worse. It's sad when the most enjoyable character in a movie is David Hasselhoff portraying a more exaggerated version of himself. Garey Busey shows up long enough to get farted on by a dead cow. Paul Scheer, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd return from the remake. Lloyd is the only one who makes himself useful. Meanwhile, Rhames does his best Cherry Darling impression and Scheer just kind of complains about everything.

David Koechner is probably the most enjoyable of the new faces and that's mostly due to him playing his role way more seriously than he should. This is probably the least ridiculous and over the top that he's ever been. As for the younger parts of the cast, they're nothing but bait with lines. When they're not jumping in puke for no reason at all, humping pool jets, or being completely incapable of properly running off of a dock, they're having some of the worst sex to ever be featured in a horror movie. What transpires between Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is so utterly asinine; especially Shelby's last line. The sex scene in the van isn't much better.

""Piranha DD"" is listed as having an 83-minute runtime, but it's more like 70 and is still difficult to swallow given its short length. You could at least find a few things to compliment in the remake. With ""Piranha DD,"" it essentially has nothing to make viewing this feature worthwhile. The cast is awful, the screenplay is unbearable, and the special effects are laughable. Even the ending makes it seem like everyone who made this hates its core audience. ""Here's this crap ending. Yeah, the movie bombed and everyone hated it but we're going to make another one anyway!""

You know what you're getting with ""Piranha DD."" It does not offer anything that you wouldn't discover at face value or by watching the trailer. You know it's going to be nothing but naked women and gore. But when the gore doesn't deliver and nudity is all you have to fall back on, then you might as well just watch porn since you know you'll at least walk away from that with a spring in your step. ""Piranha DD"" will have you wanting to throw in ""Jaws"" just to wash off its stench and get the last remaining bloodthirsty and carnivorous fish out of your brain.

Special features include Commentary with Director John Gulager, Producer Joel Soisson, and Co-Writer Marcus Dunstan, three Deleted Scenes, The Story Behind the DD (just shy of 8 minutes in length), The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff (around 2 minutes), Busey's Bloopers (also 2 minutes), Wet and Wild with David Koechner (about a minute and a half), and ""A Lesson with John McEnroe"" - A Dimension Short Film (about 4 minutes).

""Piranha DD"" is now available as a single disc DVD and three disc combo (Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD +digital copy). It's rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use. The movie is presented in widescreen with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio with 5.1 DTSHD-MA (Blu-ray) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD) sound.

However, it was at least a visceral, gory blast with lots of great eye candy.  In this more-of-the-same sequel, there is less of everything.  Less fun, less gore, less tongue-in-cheek comedy, less professionalism on the parts of the writer and director.  What you get in this sequel is a bunch of pointless cameos, cartoonish direction, too-goofy comedy and less creative gore.  Not to mention some less-than-inspired acting.  It's no wonder this only got dumped into a handful of theaters before ending up on disc.

What did I think?
It was Porky's with Piranhas in this feast of boobs and gore.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the first reboot.  Even the CGI of the first was ten times better...almost making this look cartoonish at points. They seemed focused on putting as much nudity as possible in this film. This is somewhat reminiscent of the campy horror films of the 80's, and is worth watching if you are a fan of that or want to see David Hasselhoff in his lifeguard uniform again.",1347148800,,858,4.538961038961039

What makes this film a gem is the fact that Director John Gulager knows that this is just another Piranha film and he doesn't expect to win any Academy Awards with it. Never taking the film content too serious, Gulagar goes all out with the over the top comedy and gore. KUDOS JOHN!!! YOUR FORMULA WORKS!!!

 There are no disappointments for the viewers who enjoy extreme ""pop-out"" 3D. A few shots had me reaching for 3D objects in front of my nose.

My only complaint with this film is that when watching the Ving Rhames pool scene, I had to constantly remove my 3D glasses and wipe my eyes because I was laughing so hard I was crying.  (O.K. So that's not really a complaint.)

This film is a must for anyone who loves horror, comedy, and 3D.",1347148800,,878,4.323170731707317

4407084,4,B004LWZW6U,"Just when you thought it was safe to go to your local water park, Anchor Bay Home Entertainment releases ""Piranha 3DD"" on not-so-innocent viewers. The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success ""Piranha"" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.

A school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.

Roger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine ""Jaws"" if it took place in a water park the kids in ""Porky's"" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching ""Piranha 3DD.""

The CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.

""Piranha 3DD's"" high definition audio and video transfer will satisfy viewers. All the carnage and mayhem is visually clean and crisp. The 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees you'll hear every scream of terror, hiss of a piranha, and crash of the dramatic music score perfectly.

There's lots of bonus material in the 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of the movie. Audio Commentary with director John Gulager, producer Joel Soisson, and co-writer Marcus Dunstan is included.

The featurettes are short but cover more ground than you'd imagine. The seven - minute ""The Story Behind the DD"" covers the making of the movie with cast and crew interviews. ""The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff"" is exactly what it sounds like: the actor discussing the movie and his life. There are also short featurettes with fan-favorite actors Gary Busey and David Koechner entitled ""Busey's Bloopers"" and ""Wet and Wild with David Koechner.""

Three deleted scenes give us more R-rated antics with Big Dave. The comedy short film ""A Lesson with John McEnroe"" is unrelated to the movie but still funny.

The 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of ""Piranha 3DD"" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware. A great high-definition transfer and a few interesting special features make this a recommended buy for fans of Roger Corman creature features and the likes.",1346803200,7,2882,5.065400843881856

4407147,3,B004LWZW6U,"Writing a straight-up serious review of PIRANHA 3DD is a bit beside the point.  Plot means little; something about a guy opening an adult-themed waterpark, his step-daughter opposed to the changes he's made, and suddenly the prehistoric fish from PIRANHA 3D show up and make a mess of things.  That's it, there you go, a few romantic angles thrown in--some predictably touching, some there for nothing other than nudity and graphic violence.  Oh, and humor--bucket loads of dark humor, just like with any horror comedy.

PIRANHA 3DD isn't quite as funny/enjoyable as its predecessor, if only because we've been here before and know what to expect (what a great ending, by the way; not quite surprising, but still gutsy enough to feel new).  The acting is what it should be--over-the-top from the supporting cast, more authentic and realistic from the main pair (Danielle Panabaker and Matt Bush).  We've got David Koechner doing his thing; Christopher Lloyd back from the first one; Gary Busey making a nice intro cameo; and especially David Hasselhoff, doing probably the best role of his career--himself (he also comes away with some of the film's funnier lines).  The effects are predictably modern-cheesy (I didn't see the 3D version; still not convinced it's the wave of the cinematic future), and the script and direction are similar to the first.

That's basically the gist: if you liked PIRANHA 3D, you'll like PIRANHA 3DD.  It's for those of us who don't always take our movies seriously.  It's a break from the Oscar-worthy dramas and the horror films that take themselves far too seriously.  If you like movies that focus on gore, nudity, and humor, then check out PIRANHA 3DD.

4407150,3,B004LWZW6U,"For exploitation fans, horror nuts and 3-D enthusiasts, you couldn't find a more fitting film to unofficially end the summer season with than PIRANHA 3DD, the gleefully bad, junky sequel to Alexandre Aja's 2010 hit which - despite its token theatrical release last May - seems to have been shot with the small-screen in mind to begin with.

This time out, the prehistoric piranhas have moved along to another group of underground lakes in Arizona, just in time for the relaunch of a water theme park run by college grad Danielle Panabaker and her resident, obnoxious stepfather David Koechner. Having tapped into the water supply where the piranhas are swimming about, ""The Big Wet Water Park"" is about to be the site of yet another bloody massacre once the piranhas arrive - about the same time as David Hasselhoff, playing himself as he hits ""rock bottom"" as the attraction's big guest star.

Aja's original ""Piranha"" was an over the top, almost cheerful exercise in horror mayhem, and it's surprising - given the film's success - that the Weinsteins decided to go the cheap route with producing a follow up. Veterans of Dimension's home video sequels including director John Gulager and producer Joel Soisson were brought in to make ""Piranha 3DD"" on a clearly reduced budget, with notably diminished make-up effects (gorehounds will surely be disappointed by the reduction of severed heads and limbs here) and a B-list, younger cast (Christopher Lloyd does show up, briefly reprising his role from the original; so does Ving Rhames, who wisely opted to go uncredited under the circumstances).

Make no mistake, ""Piranha 3DD"" isn't anything close to resembling a good movie, but once you realize this is essentially a trashy direct-to-video sequel - and acknowledge the diminished set of expectations that comes with the territory - the film still provides a modest amount of entertainment. This is especially true when it comes to Hasselhoff's involvement, which yields several big laughs (no more so than when the aging star, in lifeguard gear, runs to aid an obnoxious young boy to the strains of the ""Baywatch"" theme). The 3-D isn't anything spectacular - and the thrills never come close to matching the epic carnage of its predecessor - but the movie still provides a fast assortment of corpses, T&A and the occasional cameo from a genre character actor (in addition to Lloyd, Rhames, and ""The Hoff,"" Gary Busey is offed in a weak opening sequence). It also wraps things up at around the 70-minute mark and adds some 10 minutes of amusing bloopers that roll over the end credits. It's not good, but it's certainly fun if you can get into the right mindset.

Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray combo pack (3D, 2D and DVD) of ""Piranha 3DD"" includes a generally good 1080p MVC encoded 3-D transfer. There's ghosting in the image during the Busey sequence, but from that point forward, the natively-shot 3-D looks fine - the issue is that the 3-D isn't particularly well utilized by Gulager, so few effects stand out. The DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack is sound, and extras (on the 2D Blu-Ray) include commentary by Gulager, a couple of deleted scenes, a few featurettes with Hasselhoff, Koechner and Busey, and a worthless four-minute Michael Ratner ""comedy"" short, ""A Lesson with John McEnroe.""",1345680000,6,3277,4.963570127504553

Piranha 3DD does that and I thought very well. They had some great cameos like they did in the first one. The plot while very plain and bland was still enough to keep the movie going for me atleast. I saw this on the PS3 network in 3d and i have to admit I really don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about. This movie had a lot of fun 3D in it. I can think of atleast 15-18 scenes that has some really great pop outs and felt there was a good natural depth through most of the movie. Trust me when I say that I am a 3D nut and in no way will you be disappointed getting the 3d verson of the film.

If you like cheesy horror movies like I do and love a fun 3D playground with it, i really don't think you can go wrong with Piranhas 3DD, Ofcourse I would also recomend you see the original  Piranha 3d as well.",1345680000,3,974,3.865
4407152,3,B004LWZW6U,"In the interest of fairness and full disclosure, I must admit that PIRANHA in any ""D"" is not my kind of movie.  Usually, I try to avoid watching films of this genre because I hate losing those 90-120 minutes of my life that I can never get back again.

Also, since I do not own a 3-D Blu-Ray player or television set, I opted to watch this movie on regular DVD.

That said, I have no doubt that this sequel to PIRANHA 3D (2010) will more than please the audience for which it was intended (i.e. people who enjoy watching movies in which monster fish eat other people.)  In fact, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames, both of whom were in the first picture, are back for this one.

The JAWS-like plot is set in moneymaking Big Wet Water Park where the prehistoric flesh-eating fish find a smorgasbord on the attraction's opening day of summer.

The problem with this picture, directed by John Gulager, is that the filmmakers can't seem to decide whether they wanted to make an all out horror film or an all out spoof.  As it turned out, the movie is neither.  In the first half, the gore factor is just too much to evoke laughs, and some of the humorous sequences attempted (e.g. a sex scene with disastrous results) are too ridiculous to be funny.

Truthfully, while watching the movie, I was tempted several times to turn the damn thing off...but I'm glad that I didn't, because about midway through, David Hasselhoff makes his first appearance (playing himself and making light of his public image), and then PIRANHA 3DD becomes fun...even for me.  It becomes the all out spoof that it should have been from the start.

Hasselhoff is terrific, as are Lloyd and Rhames, who are obviously enjoying their roles.  Also in the cast are Gary Busey, Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner and the director's father, Clu Gulager.

Stupid ""jokes"". Dumb scenes wasting the few B list actors present. Decent production values but anyone with a computer can do that nowadays. Lots of crappy rock music and scenes of topless chicks.

I was actually looking forward to this one. I have to say that I was disappointed. Even though the plot was about the same as the original this one didn't have the same feeling and wasn't as much fun to watch. Yes, this does still have all the blood, boobs and some over the top aspects that you would expect it was just missing the humor that the first one had.

The first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha/dp/B002ZG98KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha</a>&nbsp;was a full-on blast.  Scary enough, but also entertaining and funny.  The Richard Dreyfus cameo was classic, and the nude swimming scene, while out of place in a campy horror movie, was gorgeous.  It managed to have a great sense of fun, but also a dedication to professional story-telling.

Dubby-dees here replaces all that with crass and uninventive nudity, too much severed penis (the one in the first movie had just the right amount of screen time), mirthless humor, shopworn tropes...I mean, no wonder this one never had a theatrical release.  It barely deserves a DVD or streaming release.

And what makes that a damned shame is that the premise has actual potential, and the actors (excluding Hasselhoff who is to acting what this reviewer is to Roger Ebert) are all quite capable, and the movie had a big enough budget to pull off something diverting.  This was a paycheck, period.  And no greater proof of that need exist than the ""outtakes"" that follow the movie.  When people are really having fun with something, sincere, uninhibited high jinks ensue.  The outtakes from DD are just as canned and cliched and pointless as the movie itself was.

Gleefully hapless characters (portrayed with excellent B-movie abandon by the likes of Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and even Richard Dreyfus) trotted through the cliche-riddled story and provided both laughs and inventive, over-the-top gore. It wasn't out to win any awards, but what it WAS out to do -- amuse and disturb -- it did quite well. So, of course, they had to make a sequel.

Unfortunately, they neglected to include half of the original formula. Truly excessive T&A? Check. Obvious character archetypes doing/saying obvious things? Check. Humor, either hokey, offensive, or smart? Check. Scares and grind-em-up deaths?

Not so much.

The problem here lies right in the set-up: an unapologetically awful man (played by David Koechner) opens a water park (with an adults only section) and contrives to fill it for free from a nearby lake. Three guesses how that plays out.

Yes. The piranhas infest the water park, and therein lies the problem. I don't know if you've ever been to a water park, but every one I've ever visited appeared to have been planned and designed by a blind man with permanent vertigo. This is usually in keeping with the looping, curving, twisting paths of the various water slides and lazy rivers, and it means it's not that hard to get turned around if the park is big. The point being: filming in one must be hell.

There is never any real sense of place to the film, and the park is never given a wide enough shot to really show the scale of the disaster. At the same time, the very fact that people are inches away from simply hopping out of the water reduces both the scale, spectacle, and believability of any of the chaos. There's a ten or fifteen minute scene of people thrashing about in water that is two feet wide and three feet deep. Gone is even any attempt at terror or (failing that) anything close to the stomach-churning destruction found in the first film.

The movie tries to make up for this in other ways. There are a couple of piranha attacks outside of the park, one of which is so over-the-top ludicrous that it is almost annoying. I won't give away any details, but I will say that it's one step away from characters shooting live piranhas out of shotguns like some kind of Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. But that's probably the point. While the first film was an aggressive and ham-fisted satire of Swarm Horror, this movie seeks only to be a cartoon of it. It's not really the same thing, and so this film -- if you'll pardon the pun -- very much lacks the bite that made the first one such a success.

As a live action cartoon, though, it's not bad. David Hasselhoff does a great job of making fun of himself AND the film. (""Stupid ginger boy,"" he complains when he hears the screams of a kid who's getting eaten. ""Why did you get back in the water?"") He's one of the better parts of the film, although he is also overused. Ving Rhames, Paul Scheer, and Christopher Lloyd, on the other hand, are woefully underused. They brighten up their brief blips in the film, but all of them feel like they were added to the script at the last minute. There are some puns and gags that work, and some that don't.

It feels half done, is the point, and this is even evident in the run time. IMDB will tell you it's 83 minutes long, but that's counting the very slow credits crawl at the end. Perhaps knowing the deficit in their film, the makers put outtakes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel over half of these end credits. It's kind of like a nice, advanced special features addition, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but I also saw it for what it was meant to be: a quick, easy distraction from the fact that the film was more entertaining behind the scenes than in front of it.

Fun for what it is, but not as fun as it wants to be or should live up to. You might enjoy yourself if you have low expectations, or you might just have more fun watching Skinemax and putting some fish in a blender.",1341792000,56,4138,4.665294924554184

This movie did not do so good because instead of doing what a good movie does with storyline, character development, movie direction, etc - this movie just throws a whole lot of BIG BOOBS at the viewers. That's what a B movie would do as well. All they do is have a lot of boobs shots and this movie is no different at it.

The special effects were as good as the first one. But, they did not use that much and the Piranha did not even show up as many times as the first.

4407351,3,B004LWZW6U,"Piranha 3DD is the sequel to Piranha 3D and other than the prehistoric origin of the title critters, it is connected through its use of gratuitous nudity, Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd. The original story has Richard Dreyfus getting killed in the first scene. In this production we are happy to see it is Gary Busey. In the original feature, porn stars provided most of the topless scenes. In this one they opt to use main stream women. Perhaps the first feature should be called 3DD and this one 3D.

This story takes place in Arizona where Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is dismayed that her stepfather (David Koechner) has changed the water park into an adult water park with topless ""certified"" strippers acting as lifeguards. Meanwhile the late Gary Busey has released the hideous piranha into the town's lake. So how do we get piranha from the lake into the swimming pools? Christopher Lloyd gives us clues.

The movie is a teen sex romp. It has lines which are an adolescent's dream, such as ""Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming"" and a few I can't repeat. The van scene was interesting if not sacrilegious. There is an intense lake scene with our heroine and one of the weirdest sex scenes since ""Teeth."" Up to this point I was thinking how much I liked what they did, with some new bits. Then at the climax scene, they made it ridiculous, especially the part with David Koechner.

That's pretty much it in a nutshell, luckily the crew of actors involved (including Danielle Panabaker, Katrina Bowden, Matt Bush, and the returning Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd) throw themselves into the proceedings with reckless abandon.  David Hasselhoff provides some hilarious moments as himself, which in itself becomes a joke that just goes on for way too long, all of which is captured by director John Gulager (Feast) who comes off with some solid moments that are sadly overshadowed by too many cheap scare tactics and some truly awful CGI and green screen effects.

Sure, the plot is almost non-existent, but do yourself a favor and recognize what these critics that get featured on Rotten Tomatoes never do - that's not the point of this movie.  It's a fun summertime flick that's meant to give you some fun jump moments and never get too scary.

I have to say, it's a shame that this didn't make it into more theaters.  I saw it in theaters by chance, but this was really a great movie to see in theaters.  It's all about the 3D and the fun environment.",1339027200,4,907,4.313609467455621
4407355,2,B004LWZW6U,"Piranha 3DD is a spectacular failure on almost all accounts. The director who's credentials include all the Feast movies can't maintain one good scene to save his life, every scene is an underwhelming void of entertainment. I don't even know where to start with this turd, but seriously, how do you f*** up Piranha's in a water park? That's like the easiest formula for cheap entertainment.

-The Story: The story is great in theory, the piranha's for some unimportant reason can break through steel so they can get into water pipes, so they'll inevitably invade the water park on opening day (Jaws anyone?). The delivery however, is bafflingly terrible. You only see the water park in the first and last ten minutes of the movie, and the middle chunk of the film is devoted to three teens in a love-triangle going on a scooby doo adventure. Remember in the previous Piranha where Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames investigate the corpse on the docks and discover it's Piranha attacks? Yeah, that piece of the story is stretched out to the majority of the movie in this snooze-fest.

Characters:
-The main characters are lame, weak, tired, boring, predictable stereotypes. We have the virtuous 'last girl' who's going to school, is abhorred by sex, and is between two guys, the cop-douchebag and the misunderstood nice guy, no further explanation necessary.
-David Koechner plays the amusement park's 51% owner (why a girl in college owns the other 49%, nevertheless cares so much about it is beyond me) who plays the smutty step-dad who wants to sexualize The Big Wet, unfortunately that's all he does and he doesn't get really campy or over the top until the very end.
-David Hasselhoff plays himself at the park in a hilarious way, a burned out celebrity that doesn't really care about what he's doing, Hasselhoff made me laugh a few times which is why I didn't think Piranha 3DD was a complete waste of time, hence a 2 star.
-Christopher Lloyd returns as well as the mad scientist further explaining whatever new thing the piranha's are capable of, he's campy and over-the-top as always and was a nice change of character from the dumb kids.
-Ving Rhames and Jerry O'Connel's assistant (who still sports the sun-lotion on his nose) also come back in minor roles where they go to the water park on the worst possible day to rehabilitate themselves and get comfortable with being in water again. Ving Rhames was also pretty damn funny, and when he walks into the pool with shotguns for legs it's pure B movie madness, if only the rest of the movie could've been as good as those cameos.

The 'Intentional' Stupidity of it all:
-First of all, the douchebag cop is the only cop in this whole movie, and he looks like he just went into his junior year of highschool. So when the community discovers the presence of Piranha in their midst one year after the massacre that was the previous Piranha, the only person on the case is the young presumably inexperienced cop, he doesn't alert anyone else, doesn't tell anybody not to swim in the Piranha-infested water, none of that.
-Better yet the heroine who KNOWS the water is Piranha-infested decides to jump in anways to ""check the grates"".
-Then the water park that's trying to re-establish itself with sex appeal has an employee that's about 300lbs who has a face like a pug dog and has hobbies such as jumping in puke and using the water jets to masturbate. Not only is that a bad business move but the guy can't control himself, in the middle of their opening day he's still masturbating with the water jets oblivious to the piranha attacks going on. Who hired this guy again?

Inept Directing:
-There's a scene where a woman who unknowingly had a baby piranha in her vagina is getting intimate with her boyfriend when the piranha comes out and bites his penis. Now this is something that the director and the audience could've had a lot of fun with, they could've played it as really horrifying and/or really funny, but the scene just sort of happens. The woman passes out with puke spurting out of her mouth for some reason and the guy screams and walks over to the kitchen and severs his penis off with the piranha attached. Then right after that chaos everything is quiet and the girl wakes up somehow, walks around until the boyfriend jump-scares her. That's it? It's like they just read the script and filmed it just like that, no visual flair, no funny or ridiculous lines acted, it's all really just bland and trying too hard to be shocking, with no sense of passion from the filmmaker's part.
-Another scene earlier has a couple getting kinky in a van using handcuffs when the van rolls into the lake after a mishap with the parking break, the girl can get out but the boyfriend is stuck in the van with the handcuffs still attached, then when he gets attacked you just see a few close-ups of flesh being bitten and see him reacting poorly. You don't really see any of the attack, all you see is another jump-scare where his bloody stump pops open to surprise the girl who's on top of the van. Also when the car is rolling into the water about 1 minute later it's in the middle of the lake, but cars don't float all the way in the middle of a lake before they start sinking, so this was another instance of plot conveniences trumping logic.

The Piranha Attack: The disappointment to end all disappointments, Phantom Menace ain't got s*** on this. The shots that establish the park seem like a bunch of advertisements with naked chicks, going tubing down water slides, swimming in the pools, going tubing, etc. When the piranha eventually attack it's those exact same shots again with CGI Piranha added. There's virtually no build-up to the attack, you see one piranha that acts like a scout swim around for a second than swim back into the broken grates to tell the swarm or something. Somehow a solution that equals 'get out of the pool' is stretched out to like 15 minutes of underwhelming mayhem, showing mostly just the heroes randomly running around with some blood and bodies in the pools behind them in the background. The piranha's themselves just weren't threatening either, multiple times characters jump into piranha-infested waters and 'just narrowly' avoid getting eaten by the 5 or 6 piranha, it never feels like a massive swarm of them like in the first one, speaking of the first piranha...

What worked for the first Piranha movie's attack was how the scene's worked together. The piranha's swam up to the partiers, bite the first lady, and chaos ensued in many different fun/gross ways. We go from the floating stage being toppled over, to people climbing frantically on boats, to boats running people over in the chaos, to half eaten people crawling out of the water. Here, it's just people splashing in red water that can't get out of the pool, and none of the creative gore such as a woman's hair getting ripped off is evident here, it's just prosthetic bodies. Weak.

However there were a few moments where I was cracking up, David Koeschner trying to escape and running over a little kid was pretty great, and Ving Rhames comparing Piranha to kids whizzing in the pool also got a chuckle out of me. Another thing that was pretty funny was the zooming camera shot when Roy Schieder saw the boy get eaten by the shark in Jaws was used repeatedly whenever David Hasselhoff looked around, and the same dramatic shot comes back everytime Hasselhoff turns around again and looks at the carnage; words can't really do that part justice.

Those few good chuckles was about all the entertainment value I got from Piranha 3DD though, it's a bad sign when the cameos are the only good thing going for your movie. Piranha 3DD's actual use of the piranhas was lame and underwhelming and overall I wouldn't recommend Piranha 3DD unless you're really curious/bored.",1338768000,21,7831,4.698470502549163

3DD opens with grad student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker, ""The Crazies"") arguing with her now widowed step-father (David Koechner, who seemingly tries to play his role dramatically) about the future of their inherited water park.  Mandy, a 49% owner wants it to continue to be family friendly.  Chet (Koechner) has the great idea to make it an adult strip club located within the water park.  Chet wins the battle.

The film is set in the progressive state of Arizona so we are easily convinced that it was no problem getting approval for families with young kids to come in the same gates as horny voyeurs.  Not to worry however as there is a fence that apparently separates the family friendly environment from full frontal nudity and pole dancing.  The 48"" rule applies.  That's how tall you must be to see over the fence and the pre-adolescent boys take advantage.  Those boys also have an advantage over the audience however as director John Gulager only lingers a couple nano-seconds when it comes to bare skin before moving on to the next shot.  Hey, the movie's only 82 minutes.  Gotta hurry.

But, this is a movie about deadly fish right?  This particular water park would seem to be isolated from the now abandon lake nearby where all the piranha did their dirty work.  Thanks to good old Chet who had sunk a deep water well near the park (where's that regulation Arizona?), the still viable fish eggs have their chance to hatch...and of course they do (thanks to Gary Busey).  The well gives the quick growing meat eaters direct entry to the fresh water pools.

Piranha 3DD also teaches us a lesson about anatomy.  I didn't know that a small fish could enter a woman's naughty parts (in this case, nubile virgin Katrina Bowden), then grow a bit with nothing more than the woman having a stomach ache.  But wait.  Shelby the virgin (Bowden) decides that it must be time for her to abandon her ""V"" status with her boyfriend.  He of course is game but gets a climax he wasn't expecting!  I know this all sounds fun but it actually is very boring and uneven.  3DD is missing all those things its predecessor had going for it.",1338768000,11,2548,4.571743929359823
4407381,3,B004LWZW6U,"Piranha 3DD is the sequel to 2010's Piranha 3D, which was a remake of 70's Roger Corman classic. I was looking forward to this movie since I liked the goretastic Piranha 3D. However, after watching this I have no idea why it was made. Sure it's okay, but okay isn't good enough. Piranha 3D was a monster movie that was like a masterpiece compared to a Syfy original movie. However, Piranha 3DD really isn't any better than a lot of those Syfy original movies. I swear, it isn't much better than Mega Piranha and Dinocroc. There doesn't seem to be near as much gore as in Piranha 3D, which was that movie's selling point. This ones selling points seems to be boobs, but you can see those anywhere. I really wanted a lot of gore and action, and it just didn't happen much. And David Hasselhoff appears as himself, and it's pretty lame. Also, the movie is only 72 minutes not counting closing credits. The closing credits contain bloopers. So after all the bashing, you might be wondering why I'm giving Piranha 3DD 3 stars out of 5. Well, it was pretty entertaining. I mean, I was never too bored. And it's mercifully short. But I highly doubt there will be a Piranha 3DDD.",1338768000,5,1171,4.4766355140186915

4407383,5,B004LWZW6U,"*******The review contains spoilers so if you are intending to see this flick, you may want to read this review afterwards********

After 2010's hit horror remake ""Piranha"" made a killing at the box office ($83 million worldwide on a $25 million budget), Weinstein Company quickly gave the go ahead to make an even campier sequel with the affectionate title ""Piranha 3DD."" Tentatively scheduled for August 2011, the release date came and went without any word about the film. Weinstein soon announced that they would be releasing the horror sequel in November 2011. Once again, the release date whizzed by with no word from the studio as to when or if the film would be released. Now, on June 1st, the film has finally been released to horror hell. Opening in 83 theaters this weekend, the film is also showing on demand (where I caught it as no theaters within a 100 mile radius of me is playing the flick). With little press and even littler buzz, the film has little to no hope of making waves at the box office. Did Weinstein Company lose faith in the film? Is the film so awful that it simply doesn't deserve a theatrical release and the studios is simply fulfilling contract obligations? Let's take a step into these piranha filled waters and find out.

""Piranha 3DD"" begins one year after the famous attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas. Extremely bad press from the incident has left the lake devoid of any life whatsoever. The town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism by horny spring breakers. At a nearby lake, two middle aged rednecks named Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager) wade into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow carcass, and before you can say ""piranha meal"" the farmers are killed by a hungry and very angry swarm of baby piranha.

Enter Maddy (the lovely ""Friday the 13th"" remake star Danielle Panabaker) a marine biology student. She returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror, and our amusement, that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with `water-certified strippers', and re-open it as ""Big Wet"" where the ""double DD's get in for free."" At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old friends, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (the enjoyable slimy Chris Zylka), and Barry (Matt Bush) who has secretly had a crush on her since grade-school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy), and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). It doesn't take long to guess who will and won't become piranha bait.

Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her you-know-what(yes, you read that right). Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) go to have sex in their van. They accidentally trip the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake, where they are both devoured by the angry piranhas.

The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by the swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry bring it to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd even stranger and more over-the-top than he was in the original) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark.

Back at the waterpark, we find celebrity lifeguard David Hasselhoff (played by himself in a hilarious, mocking tone similar to Jennifer Tilly's role in ""Seed of Chucky"") has been hired on as an ""A list"" lifeguard from the waterpark. It doesn't take long before the piranhas find their way to the park to devour and feast on the lovely young teens and the families enjoying their stay at ""Big Wet.""

Sound silly, over-the-top, and preposterous? Of course it is! The film is ""Piranha 3DD"" not ""Schindler's List."" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like ""Piranha 3DD"" is a different proposition. The film itself is not nearly as good as the original remake (how's that for an oxymoron?) but I would argue that this sequel is a hell of a lot more fun. Take out the 13 minute credits (stay for them, there are some funny bloopers and behind the scenes video) and you are left with a 70 minute nonstop rollercoaster ride that is over before you can even begin to think of the bad acting and nonsensical plot developments. ""Piranha 3DD"" left me craving another sequel and isn't that the best thing you can say about a cheesy horror flick?",1338508800,7,5085,4.732505643340858
4407384,2,B004LWZW6U,"Lacking the serousness and realism the first one had. Too many female cliches' that the real world just doesn't tolerate. For example: No. 1 Do you think ashley who is (a hot slutty black chick with big boobies and is my BBF whom steals all my boyfriends) is hotter than me (a skinny, boobless bleach blonde with the brain of a empty peanut shell) and by the way I'm a virgin with issues. ""I'm hot, right?"" First of all ladies the answer will always be Yes, she is hotter than you. Even when we say no, she is not. No. 2 The deputy sheriff (not sheriff and no sheriff appears for some unknown reason)is a 16 year old pretty boy whom couldn't convince us of his adulthood even if he had a mustache as thick as Eugene Levy's eyebrows. And No. 3 Gary Busey is in it. And surprisingly the most believable performance. The second being ha ha ha The Hoff. I went in to this expecting less then zero and still felt like I lost something to this movie aside from the $7 and 84 mins. This movie had no ""grown ups"" what so ever. The boobs weren't all that great, just flashy. So much potential that was ruined by the director and The Weinstien's. All though I will end this on a happy note. I hope they make a third, but with a better and more chaotically controlled director who isn't out to make a cartoon.",1338508800,4,1298,4.237903225806452

From start to finish each scene (especially the finale) is a constant good set up that just leaves you expecting more.  Time after time it is just a complete let down.  This movie will surely go down as the movie that could have been.  You would have more fun buying a piranha puppet and going to a local pool to scare small children.  If you really must see this movie I seriously suggest waiting till it hits cable or maybe get it through netflix or other prepaid service, cause In my opinion you'll be sorry if you spend your money on it.",1338508800,3,659,4.317073170731708

I can't say it's as good as that one but that is one of the best movies ever made.

This is still awesome enough to get five stars and it has so many sick parts.

Like a girl has a piranha in her va jay jay and it bites this guy's weiner off.

Also there is a book in it called The Ghost Who Walks and it's like about fish that walk on land to hunt us.

The ending it totally shocking and just what you'd expect if you've seen the director's previous work like Feast.

All the acting was over the top and it worked in a movie like this.

Also David Haselhoff's performance as himself is worth seeing the movie alone and is almost as great as Jerry O'Connell in the first one.",1338508800,3,758,3.8766233766233764

It doesn't get a 5 star from me simply because there are some parts that simply don't need to be there (funny as his cameo was, why do we need a ""trailer"" for ""Fish Hunter""?  It wasn't fun or funny.) or are things we've seen before (*ahem* Hollywood, please notice what was said, I down scored you for REPEATING yourself.  Break New Ground).
