6125350,5,B00H0EN9D4,"Poignant animated movie about what it feels like to be elderly.....living in a nursing home facility.  This is an engaging piece which doesn't feel sorry for itself, doesn't apologize and doesn't pull any punches.  The main character is a victim of early (and intermittently exhibited) Alzheimer's.  He is an endearing protagonist, and soon make fast friends on his floor.......no spoilers here.  It's worth watching, for everyone.  Young and old alike should watch this movie.  I loved it.",1412812800,14,490,5.298701298701299

6125378,3,B00H0EN9D4,"Knowing someone who was in one of those homes the movie made me sad.  However, people who don't know about it should watch it.
Someday it might be you. There was humor in it.  They had more freedom than the person I knew but was basically the same routine.
Though most of the patients have some kind of dementia they still want to get out.  I almost turned it off when I realized what it was
about but decided that maybe it being animated would be easier to watch.  It was.  It was still sad.",1474416000,,492,4.136842105263158

6125408,3,B00H0EN9D4,"This is an Alzheimer's story and although it was done fairly well, am not sure that I enjoyed it.  I realize that this is an issue that is happening and being dealt with daily, but since it was animated I was expecting something more lighthearted about aging.  I watched it to the end and was a bit downcast afterward and not sure what this animated movie is trying to accomplish.  I don't want to say, ""don't see this movie"" as it may be relevant to someone else.  For myself, it was a bit sad.",1463011200,,495,4.23404255319149
6125409,5,B00H0EN9D4,"This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. Everything from the art, the slow paced animations, the music, etc. All fit one main theme. This is a story about redemption and learning to love before it's too late. It's definitely not a comedy, more of a drama, but still it deserves all five stars. There are several poignant moments that really take this movie to the next stage, and it is well worth the watch.",1462665600,,413,4.376623376623376
6125410,2,B00H0EN9D4,"Well-crafted animation, but depressing.  Some of the suggestions in the story (especially the last scene thrown in for some unknown reason) are potentially disturbing.  I expected some humor, but that's not what this film is about.  It is a sad commentary on aging, with a small positive message about one man learning to genuinely care about others.  My recommendation is only to watch if you want to see a poignant tale about Alzheimer's.",1462147200,,440,4.986301369863014

6125439,5,B00H0EN9D4,"Wrinkles addresses a topic most viewers do not want to address.  That topic is the inevitable decline, dementia, diminishment and diseases that are frequently part of the death process in modern life. We live much longer now, but health span is rarely robust enough to match our lengthening lifespans. The most shattering element here is the change ageing causes in famiily relationships as demanding dependency undermines the roles of the formerly nurturing parents and renders them superfluous, costly and time consuming.  I did not enjoy this topic or this movie  .But I am in awe of the consumate skills of all involved  to accomplish the task of engaging the audience in a riviting narrative. I think everyone not trapped in complete denial about ageing and death should see this portrayal and appreciate the wonderful  artistic skills displayed here. A triumphal little flim that you owe it to yourself to see. It will wake you up. Maybe, in time.  Declan Gilhooley",1459209600,,971,5.0375

Our Western culture has created this situation in which we abandon those who took care of us when we were helpless to satisfy our desires for more material comfort. Coupled with the frustration and helplessness many feel when taking care of an aging parent who increasingly becomes a danger to their own self and others. However, this is a story of love, redemption and the resilience of the human psyche to seek adventure in a restricted environment. Personally, it gave me much to think about and be grateful for while prodding me to move more quickly on plans of my own.

I know I have been there and both the movie and the community are depressing. i am so glad to be on my own again, in my own home and functioning better than ever. Tell the medical establishment to go to hell and go see a naturapath. I think these facilities accelerate old age decline. I want to do as much as I can.

His room-mate turns out to be a small-scale grifter, nickel-and-diming petty cash from the other residents who won't remember, starting with Miguel himself.

The good news is that whoever put this together knew whereof s/he spoke. Losing one's marbles isn't a simple thing - there are so many different ones a person can lose, and at different times. That gives this movie a general low note, with the knowledge that things won't get better.

But, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fred-Rogers/dp/1401301061/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fred Rogers</a>&nbsp;advised, ""look for the helpers."" Their help isn't always of the finest kind, but looking for the helper is what ends this movie with some note of hope.

The animation is adequate, but just adequate. This one is going back to the used market ASAP. But, with this movie in mind, I'll do two things: stay closer to my elders, and not get my hopes too high when I'm the elder.

6125564,5,B00H0EN9D4,"First off, I like actually like slow movies that can sometimes seem episodic if the point of the movie is not to tell one A->B->C story, but rather emit a mood and really show off characters or an overall idea - and this movie did that beautifully.  If you are too used to fast-paced slapstick animation including action and ""culturally relevant humor"" like most of the (IMHO) crappy non-pixar American produced movies these days, then this movie isn't for you.  Yes, it is in the Amazon comedy genre, but to me it is more of a dramedy.  Because the movie gets you to care about the characters, it can be depressing at times, but also funny, not necessarily in a laugh-out-loud way, but more in a smile and snicker kinda way. It also gets you too look at the end of life in most of the western world with some sincerity.  I think people of all ages can enjoy it and maybe both get you to visit with elderly more as well as appreciate you wits and health while you still have it.",1453680000,,978,4.327868852459017

Instead I got an uncomfortable, animated look at the inside of a typical facility for the aged, the realities of old age abandonment, Alzheimers and its relentless progression and deterioration. I'm not saying it wasn't a sweet, poignant cartoon buddy story, but there's no happy ending.  It's a Spanish production and maybe this is how they teach their children about death. If that's true, they certainly don't sugar coat things!  I think in general Americans like to pretend it'll never happen, though, oddly, I think it was made for English speakers to be dubbed in Spanish.

Unflinching is a word that's used too often in reviews, but that's what this film is.  The pacing is likely to be an area of complaint for the casual viewer, but the slow pace is meant to reflect the glacial pace of life in a ""rest home"".

I especially liked the therapy segment as I have seen behaviors like those in session with clients before, and the client's-eye-view of therapy is always hilarious.  Also interesting to see how aphasia (never remember whether it's Broca's or Wernicke's, but Emilio has it) is experienced by the client. Some of the later sequences were very difficult to watch.  No spoilers but yikers.

Lastly, the acting is magnificent.  Martin Sheen (e.g., The West Wing) is Emilio, and at first we feel like it could be one of us in his place - until it becomes clearer and clearer that his mind is going, and the empathy gets a whole new dimension to it when you realize it will be one of us in his place.

This movies deals with themes of loneliness, depression, dementia, and abandonment. But don't take this to mean that this movie is completely heavy. Despite what I said earlier, this movie is not all sadness and it does have many bits of levity and fun. Within these harsh realities presented in this movie there shines love, friendship, and compassion. This is by no means a self-pitying movie, just honest.

Though the care-givers in this facility seem caring and respectful, they don't have the skills or resources to provide comfort and understanding.

The content of this movie is a realistic account of Alzheimers and the sphere of life in a nursing home. Any experience with either and this movie will certainly move your heart to tears. But it isn't all sadness, the love formed and existing between characters, the residents and the family members outshines the rough reality of Alzheimers/nursing homes. The simple animation is the perfect compliment to what can be a disturbing setting and makes it easier to watch. I had no prior knowledge to what this film was about before viewing and I'm thrilled I did. I am not an avid movie watcher and much more prefer books.

Maybe because of the names that were doing the voices people assumed that it would just be a funny slapstick comedy but it was not. At times the movie was funny, but mostly it was just a harsh reality that we all deal with every day. The characters were very thought-provoking and as a 30-year-old female that is saying a lot for me. I was entertained throughout the movie.

THIS FILM IS THE TRUTH. I have been on ALL ends of it, including staff, and it is the complete truth. BUT it is entertaining, and humourous in a black way.

6126371,5,B00H0EN9D4,"From the very beginning this movie had my emotions rolling from high to low.. It is so sad that when we age it seems that some children or family claim that they do not have the time to care for those whom took the time to raise and care for them. It is so true many people just don't want to think about getting old. We are all going to get old there is no avoiding this fact unless, we pass away before reaching our elder years.

 It breaks my heart within the western world that when the elderly become a bit hard to handle off to the old folks home. My grandmother is a Reverend, she would go to the hospital's and to the elderly homes, to read to them give them company, I loved visiting with her when she would, ""do her rounds"" we would call it. I often got upset when I would see people that did not need to be in the home, healthy as can be, and lonely too. I always told my grandmother I wouldn't allow her to ever go to one of those places. Alas she is a whipper snapper and she agree's with me.

At times it seems harsh that we live in a world were families just don't have time for those whom gave them all their time too. Yes some do need special care and could be harmed living at home with their family. But in other countries there are families that live in large homes and they never would send their elders to a home. The elders stay on the lower levels and everyone takes care of them... In the west this just barely happens.. Sigh...

This really is a must see film.  If it's one thing everyone should get from this story is, take care of mind and body when you're young, and when you get older, God forbid, if either fails you to the point that you are unable to care for yourself, try to remember that it's not your fault and you are in no way a burden to your family or society.

The producers made sure to mix in the laughs with the sadness, the movie was deeper than I was expecting but I still reccomended it to friends to watch.",1419724800,,277,4.245283018867925
6126436,5,B00H0EN9D4,"This is truly a great film that teaches one to enjoy the present. I think it is a very interesting film and is viewed through a lens of Western civilization since we are known to put our elders away so that we can go on with our lives and act as if they have no lives to continue on, which is irresponsible and incorrect. In some Eastern cultures their elders stay with the family and are not permitted to stay within nursing homes because they are seen as sources of wisdom and guidance. I think that somewhere along the way in some Western cultures we have been so focused on capitalism and get rich quick schemes that we have forgotten the value of our elders and our ancestors. We would rather pay some one to take care of our loved ones instead of take care of them ourselves. This film speaks to the issues of institutions and how they disrespect our elders and loved ones at times. This movie calls for better health care services, better financial programs for our elders that would allow for them to stay home as they live out the final years of their lives. It also reminds us of David's plea in the 90th Psalm in the 12th verse where he pleads with the Lord, ""So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.""",1419724800,,1245,4.302127659574468
6126437,3,B00H0EN9D4,Not bad for an animated show on aging and the elder care life! I wasn't  bored and liked the charactors and story. CK,1419724800,,117,4.086956521739131
6126438,1,B00H0EN9D4,"Depressing and bleak film. It's described as a comedy but it's not funny at all. It also says it's about old people rebelling against authority. It is not that either. There was no hope in this film, and it had a very ""victim"" mentality. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.",1419724800,8,267,4.36
6126439,5,B00H0EN9D4,"My mother has worked in geriatrics for all of her life and when I was younger she would take me into the nursing homes to meet the 'inmates', it taught me patience, compassion but it was also a window into what happens when we become too old to take care of ourselves.

""Wrinkles"" is an animation that brings all the realities of old age to the forefront where we cannot run from them. The depiction of life in a nursing home and the onset of dementia is spot on accurate.  I really appreciated how they weave the old adage ""Once a man twice a child"" into the script, once we go past a certain age our faculties are that of a toddler.  In traditional parts of the world the elderly live in big family households shared by every generation and they are taken care of by all members of the family. Western developed nations compartmentalize the generations and so the very old ultimately ends in a care facility outside of the family unit. Its a lonely sad process that 95% of us are destined to experience as we age. I thought it interesting how the film includes the story of a young homeless girl who also finds herself in the nursing home when she becomes permanently disabled, nursing homes used to only be for the very old but today there are a lot of young patients dumped in the facilities because they have some disability that needs round the clock care.

The film is crafted in such a way to grab the attention of the young and able bodied (the elderly of tomorrow) so they can seriously take a look at what kind of institutions and care awaits us. There is much that can be improved for the elderly including home care and facilities that don't function purely as a hospital. Our practice of not thinking about old age, how we will live and how we will be treated when we get there is part of the reason why the elderly are so isolated in an uncaring world, we just don't think its going to happen to us and that's just crazy.",1419724800,43,1936,4.3397790055248615

6126454,4,B00H0EN9D4,"Although the plot is predictable, the fact that the producers tackled the tough issue of aging through a stylistic animation should be highly praised.  It's not a movie to ""enjoy"" or something you'd watch with young kids.  However, it is thought-provoking and at least brutally honest about the harsh reality of aging and how the society deals with those who do not age with grace.  As the last scene says, the movie is for those who are aged and those who are aging, which makes all of us.  Strongly recommend viewing even if it were simply for the sake of reminding ourselves of our humanity and frailty.",1419638400,,606,4.635514018691588
