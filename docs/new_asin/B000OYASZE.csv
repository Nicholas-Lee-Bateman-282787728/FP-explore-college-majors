8187565,3,B000OYASZE,"This appeared to be a Jazz Bass DVD; however, turned out to be something only an aficionado of this person would be interested to hear.

I returned it for a refund on the basis that the description did not really match the content - not a jazz group but a solo special performance.",1490313600,,281,4.30188679245283

8187567,5,B000OYASZE,"Kristin is a (unusual) great singer/bassist with wonderful phrasing, swing, technique and (it's there too) good looks. Drummer Hollcheck is, of course, one of the best of it's kind. Austrian pianist Fritz Pauer was (unfortunately he passed away in July2012) quite a jazz musician, who (funny) looks like Dustin Hoffman at the piano, including facial expression. I may have a preference of ""Alone Together"", a tour-de-force displaying her total ease at tackling with courage accompanying herself only with her double-bass. Get this DVD!.",1361577600,,536,5.469879518072289
8187568,5,B000OYASZE,"You can definitely hear Ray Brown in Kristin's playing. She and her ensemble (Fritz Pauer on piano and John Hollenbeck on drums) form a tight trio with Kristin whose vocals add immeasurably to the performance.

A highlight was how she leads into Count Basie's Whirlybird with a story about how she came to craft lyrics for it. Ray Brown called her and challenged her to add lyrics, not even naming the tune (only humming it) leaving it to her to figure out what the song was and then to craft lyrics. She succeeded and we are treated to that in this performance.

Her ensemble is tight and has fun when possible. On the first song, I'm Old Fashioned, Hollenbeck took some extended drum breaks. Normally I would accuse drummers doing that of being too busy, but his playing fit perfectly.

That all of the trio are superbly accomplished musicians would be an understatement. The choice of songs and how they were delivered made for a perfect concert.

A few notes about when and where this performance took place: February 18, 2005 at the Porgy & Bess jazz club in Vienna. The set list is:

1. I'm Old Fashioned
2. They Say It's Spring
3. Whirlybird
4. Wouldn't It Be Lovely
5. Lined With A Groove
6. Alone Together
7. Cheek To Cheek
8. Nobody Wants To Sing The Blues
9. Top Of The World

If you love good piano trio music, especially with vocals, this is a worthwhile video. If you are a Ray Brown fan, seeing and hearing his influence live on in Kristin is reason enough to get this video.",1335916800,,1490,4.459558823529412

8187570,3,B000OYASZE,"Mira is a fantastic Basist;

He is so good, it is hard for most of us to get it; and he is a bit bored with us too, which is too bad. This DVD is essential for the Vitous fan, or anyone into any kind of Bass music. I hope Mirek can get enthused about bebop again, I love his music, and it comes so easy to him, but he really should learn to play with others, form a trio, have a good time, be himself. This DVD is an important document about how the Muse posesses and animates a willing priest of the mantra, and let there be no doubt this music is mantra.",1215648000,2,556,3.8347826086956522
