6818139,4,B00PLYU1N6,"This was a fantastic film with a great plot and message. It was directed well with smooth camera work and fantastic editing. The only problem i could find is this cover... What is this?!?!?!? Diamond Ruff has nothing to do with what is displayed on the cover! THESE CHARACTERS AREN'T EVEN IN THE FILM!!!!! I feel so bad for those who worked so hard to make this film, and ended up with this false-advertising cover. You'll definitely want to buy this movie to see the true message, but ignore this ""Hollywood"" cover.",1424908800,2,516,4.619565217391305
6818140,4,B00PLYU1N6,"The film Diamond Ruff present's a moral that would inspire a person to follow their dreams despite the negativity that they face in their life. The film it's self is amazing and captures something that a lot of people fail to show to the public and it's a shame that even though the film is inspirational it's self people are still going to be misguided by the false cover art. I just want to let everybody know that the cover art has NOTHING to do with the actual film. The actual actors of the film are not even on the cover art and they even spelled the director's name wrong on the cover art. It frustrates me because I'm from Hartford, CT and the film made it this far just for something like this to happen to it's name. I really hope that people don't let the false cover art paint a false perception of the movie in their heads.",1424736000,2,836,4.23125
6818141,4,B00PLYU1N6,"I've seen a early showing of this movie, and just so you know, if you think it's ANYTHING like the cover art shown here, you're wrong. This makes it look like it's all gangsta-style violence and sex - couldn't be further from the truth. There's plenty of great photography and action, but Fredro Starr's ""Diamond"" character mostly gets what he wants with slick cons, not violence, until he goes for a huge score that...let's just say it gets out of way out of hand. What happens next and how he deals with it will definitely hold your attention.

Anyway, if you're looking for some Boys n the Hood ripoff, look elsewhere. If you're interested in a low-budget film shot on location in - Hartford, CT of all places - with actors, action and production values that make it look like it came out of a big-bucks studio, you will be pleasantly surprised.",1418947200,4,848,4.578947368421052

8688749,4,B00PLYU1N6,This was just Ok Diamond Ruff played his role but I expected more from this movie.  It was alright.,1441670400,,99,4.2105263157894735
8688750,1,B00PLYU1N6,"I stopped this movie at about the 20 min mark. Where they go into the bank. The acting is beyond bad. Poor to no character development, the plot is poorly developed and the actor/actresses lines are really badly written. I might suggest you find some other movie and leave this one alone.",1431216000,,288,4.5576923076923075
8688751,3,B00PLYU1N6,"I agree with the majority that the cover is not like the story at all. Matter of fact, even the beginning of the story is a bit misleading. This story is just okay. It starts off telling a story of a wealthy young man who learned to hustle, then gets incarcerated on his final big heist , then goes through a few changes in jail including new charges. Then gets out only for that to be short lived. This movie is all over the place and is just okay...",1429920000,,451,4.078651685393258

8688753,4,B00PLYU1N6,"Read this book and could not wait to see the movie. Got to see it in the theaters and it was great!  Had a solid powerful, spiritual message so told my colleague about this movie which, would be a great showing for the at risk youth at the residential facility and group homes.  I even told my church about this innovative urban movie with a spiritual foundation that can be shown in the church as an activity for the congregation so, when I heard about it getting to DVD I told my pastor and colleague to go purchase the DVD so, they can see the movie.  Unfortunately, due to this DVD cover which, I can't explain the COONERY...BAMBOOZELEMENT that is being marketed out from this cover art, my pastor and colleague could not with good conscience buy it.  Didn't know what they were talking about until I saw it for myself.  This is the WORST cover I have ever seen for a movie.  First off the main character is black and none of these posers on the cover are in the movie.  This cover art is not what the movie is remotely about, very misleading, I'm going to have to purchase this movie myself and let my colleague and pastor see it to change thier mind about  it.  I can't imagine the loss of sales from many christians and fellow believers due to this cover.  Please get past this smoke and mirror and buy this DVD because it is truly an uplifting story with a powerful spiritual message.",1425254400,,1392,4.3604651162790695
8688754,1,B00PLYU1N6,"Diamond Ruff (Fredro Starr) grew up an orphan in the tough streets of Hartford. He has become a successful scam artist, performing Mission Impossible stuff. In spite of having tons of cash scamming people, he decides he must perform a poorly conceived armed bank robbery. During the robbery a cop (same one who shot his mom) kills the hostage in front of dozens of other cops and successfully frames Diamond who gets convicted and goes to jail for murder. While in jail we get some spiritual stuff. Diamond tries to clear himself  of the murder charge because if he does he will be immediately released from prison because armed robbery is apparently a wrist slap in Connecticut.

None of the plot made any sense. The story seemed to center around bad white cops lying and framing poor innocent bank robbing, kidnapping black men with murder. Throw in a Bible verse or two and we get a really sad story of redemption.

I have no idea where these rave reviews come from. Bad plot, worse acting. Camera work and sound seemed professional enough for a low budget indie.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1425168000,,1100,4.683937823834197
8688755,5,B00PLYU1N6,"Diamond Ruff is an inspirational book turned movie that has motivated me to never give up on myself. This great literature expresses the true meaning of over coming adversity and human will power.  There are noticeable errors all over this movie cover including spelling errors and faulty imaging. Amazon has also provided a false movie description which is sad and ridiculous because it belittles the producers vision.  The movie consist of big name actors such as Fredro Starr, Felicia ""Snoop"" Pearson, Freddie Jackson, and Michael Colyar; however you would never know from this amateur movie cover.  They say a picture is worth a million words and this image painted a completely different story.  I sure hope the producer did not consent to this absurd cover that falsifies his work .  From me to you don't be deceived by this crap cover! GO OUT, READ DIAMOND RUFF! SEE DIAMOND RUFF!  I PROMISE, IT IS BIGGER AND BETTER THAN THIS HORRIBLE PROMOTION.  Everyone is talking about it!!",1424995200,,985,4.933333333333334
8688756,5,B00PLYU1N6,"This film is an incredible work of art - a transformative telling of a young man who is grappling with trauma, trust, and the meaning of success within our oppressive U.S. (in)justice system. This film is incredibly relevant for our times and yet timeless as well. The only issue I have is with this cover. I have seen the original artwork of the film and believe it is much more suitable in suggesting the real heart of the story. This cover is an insult to the integrity of the film - for it has none of the actors of the film in it and sends the complete wrong message for what the film is about! I wonder what happened!",1424995200,,623,4.243697478991597
