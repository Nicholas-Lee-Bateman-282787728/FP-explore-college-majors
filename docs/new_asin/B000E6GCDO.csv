It has absolutely nada to do with the actual Carlos.  If it were at least a decent expenditure of 90 mins. I'd forgive the mis-labeling.... but it's not.",1287273600,,304,4.826923076923077
8106672,4,B000E6GCDO,"The description says there's a spanish audio, but the back of the DVD states it's only english. Most of the first half Also, I believe this was 1979 release, not 1977. Andres Garcia has been in over 100 movies during his life time. It was great seeing the young version of him in this flick. More recently I saw him the telenovela El Cuerpo del deseo. The movie is narrative style, I don't even think he speaks in this or anyone else. Lots of ""starsky and hutch"" type music. Great 1970's action flick.",1220227200,,501,4.397849462365591
