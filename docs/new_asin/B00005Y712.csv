7956756,2,B00005Y712,"Mikage's plan to evolve the human race with the help of an illuminati style group of leaders from all over the world is coming to a dead-end as most of the C-Genome carriers he has gathered begin to sicken and die. Even Aya herself will die unless she can get her hands on Ceres' Celestial Robe. Aki, meanwhile, fully transforms into the long dead husband of Ceres as he aquires the synthetic Robe that Mikage constructed with the energy of the C-Genome women and seems intent not only on getting Ceres back....but killing her! The event that starts all this rolling is a farewell concert by one of the few C-Genome girls still free, who is a pop idol. She uses her show to throw a parting shot at the Mikage corporation in the form of a giant energy release that almost destroys its headquarters.

Volume 8 of Ceres left me disappointed in terms of quality but conforms with the generally average nature of the show which could have been good with better writing. First of all, I don't see what purpose the pop idol descendant really served. She seemed like an interesting character but her role in the show begins and ends with one episode which leads me to believe that she might have had a bigger role in the manga version. Again, the sound effects of the show are awful. Every character has the same footstep sound, like someone mashing peanuts in their hands. I only listened to the Japanese voice acting, but as usual with the series, the most emotional bits were overacted and seemed spoken in a soundproof box. The story was the only halfway decent part of Volume 8 but even it bordered on mind numbing sentimentality, especially when some of the main characters face life threatening situations. Do we really have to see another shirtless guy with angel wings flying around? This show was decent and I definitely want to check out the manga, but you're not really missing anything if you fail to watch this.",1168905600,,1917,4.605263157894737

7956758,5,B00005Y712,"I'm really interested in this series, but before buying this I'd like to know how many episodes it contains. Could anybody please tell me? thanx",1119484800,,144,4.8
7956759,4,B00005Y712,"Very intense end to the Ceres series. Lots of action and you really get to find out how Ceres felt about the Progenitor. The cool thing is you feel for the bad guys (Kagami Mikage) and the good guys (Yuuhi).
My only minor complaint is the dvd extras. It's the same character profiles that shows up in all 8 volumes along with a textless ending. Big whoop. Overall though if you don't care about the lack of extras, it's a fine, unique story with a unique ending.",1020124800,2,462,4.32183908045977
7956760,5,B00005Y712,"If you have seen the rest of the series, this is a must have! The end put me into tears, its very sweet, sorrowful and it brings the beauty in this anime. However, see the rest of the series for it to make sense. The ending is very rewarding. It truly is fantastic. A must see",1016841600,,276,3.9464285714285716
7956761,5,B00005Y712,"It isn't easy to surprise people who have been watching anime for years with a story.  And yet, throughout this series, Ceres has broken the rules and all the conventions especially in the shoujo genre.  Make no assumptions about the end of this amazing series.  Who lives and who dies is all up for grabs. And yet, with the wonderful story telling of this show, the bittersweet finale is satisfying for all as the hagaromo is found and Ceres and her husband have their final showdown.  Even the very last moments yield some final surprises as interestingly enough, in a genre where the girl is loved by all the heroes, one of the most original ways of dealing with a love triangle (Yuuhi-Aya-Touya) is given.  Have your hankies on stun, please...",1013385600,12,747,4.67175572519084
