4830106,5,B005LS4MW8,every woman should watch this movie because it's true they do not trust men so they do this to learn,1400889600,,100,4.05
4830107,5,B005LS4MW8,"I must admit the first 10 minutes of the movie I thought, this is not going to be good..... But it kept getting better and better...and there were quite a few 'laugh out loud' scenes in it.  I would definitely recommend!",1400716800,,220,4.365853658536586
4830108,5,B005LS4MW8,It's not the normal love story but great to tap into the fears and hurdles that people face in giving up their heart to someone.,1399507200,,128,4.16
4830109,5,B005LS4MW8,"my opinion it was pretty good script.....I can relate I have a very good guy....And I could say the same ....He's mine not yours
a lot of ladies need to know this......I wasn't quite feeling the particular brand of test......Could lead to mis-trust....But bottom line is
what's yours is yours and what's mine is mine....",1397779200,,320,4.836363636363636

and so did the guy caught in the middle
it was fun to watch",1397001600,,94,3.75
4830112,3,B005LS4MW8,Nothing great about this movie--storyline has been told before and this movie did not deviate from all the previous movies.,1396828800,,123,5.2

4830114,5,B005LS4MW8,"This movie highlights the extreme measure of how far one would go to find or to dig up anything against their mate if he or she is faithful or not. This movie passed in my rating, for this is my second time watching this title and mine to keep.",1395360000,,244,4.0
4830115,4,B005LS4MW8,Good to watch with mate. Matbe even better on a FRiday or Saturday night. Never test a relationship to it's breaking point.,1394409600,,123,4.636363636363637

4830117,4,B005LS4MW8,This movie was a surprise. They had really good actors and you never knew what direction it was going. I liked this movie because it was unpredictable.,1392076800,,151,4.62962962962963

4830119,4,B005LS4MW8,Food for thought! The acting was excellent and the theme was something we all wonder in relationships. Finding the right person takes work.,1391040000,,139,5.086956521739131
4830120,3,B005LS4MW8,"I watched this with the idea that it made for a decent Saturday morning viewing experience, with a few familiar cast members, as well as unknowns. My expectation was that it would be a typical, Tyler-Perryesque type of movie with messages delivered in a heavy-handed manner; lacking in character development and plausible plot. Well, since Mr. Perry was not involved, it actually rose a few notches above that level. Oh it contained the usual hint of peachiness I expected, but not as heavy handedly. There were comedic turns, dilemmas that needed solving, and a few surprise twists (very few), but all-in-all, an ok movie. I would have given two and a half stars but that option wasn't offered.",1390348800,,695,4.898305084745763

4830124,4,B005LS4MW8,"While I am typically not a fan of low budget films, they did a great job with this one.  The story flowed well and the filming was good also.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one and will be watching it again.  It's a great chick flick!",1388880000,,239,4.042553191489362
4830125,5,B005LS4MW8,"Good movie overall. I like the script and the respect the writer showed to all characters. I can watch this movie 3 times a day. The stereotypical nonsense about nasty women being screwed by despicable boyfriends is non-existence here. Rent this and watch with your significant other, you won't regret it one bit! It's wholesome and no gratuitous sex scene which are outrageous.",1388707200,,378,5.015873015873016

4830127,5,B005LS4MW8,This film is good only because of one woman and I'm not talking about the light skinned chick causing all the trouble. I'm talking about the chick in the blue dress that came and sat down at the table when dude was with brooke.,1386633600,,227,4.181818181818182

4830130,4,B005LS4MW8,Cute movie but everyone sees things differently because what one think is there is a fool . No one owes anyone else although they think they do. Funny to say the least.,1383177600,,168,4.28125
4830131,3,B005LS4MW8,"Like so many African American films,this movie has an unrealistic slapped together feel to it,no character development sub par acting,poor writing, and just an mediocre feel to it the only reason to watch this movie really as a man is the eye candy,don't make it yours.",1383091200,,269,4.869565217391305
4830132,5,B005LS4MW8,This is an excellent movie for women to watch regarding trusting your man. I definitely makes you think about what you would do.,1382659200,,128,4.608695652173913

4830134,4,B005LS4MW8,Be careful of what you ask for. Enjoyed watching this and seeing a number of black actors/actress that I haven't seen for a while. This was a good movie and it made me and my girls laugh.,1379548800,,187,4.081081081081081
4830135,5,B005LS4MW8,This is good feel good romantic movie. A little different from the main stream ones. I am happy amazon carries a small movie like this.,1376870400,,135,4.44
4830136,5,B005LS4MW8,He is mine but do I really want him? This was good depiction in film ' you don't know what you have until is no longer yours',1375401600,,125,3.6666666666666665
4830137,3,B005LS4MW8,Kind of cute.  Made for TV type of movie.... a romantic comedy with a little twist.  Probably a little more than ok.  Price was right for Prime member.,1374624000,,151,4.321428571428571
4830138,4,B005LS4MW8,"Great film about love men women and appreciating what you have.  Mandy helps women fund out if their men are keepers or loser cheaters. A client challenges Mandy . Hmm will Mandy steal her man or will the client keep him. It's fun, funny , and had great lessons, cast includes Wendy Raquel Robinson , caryn ward, and Gabrielle Dennis from bet's the game, Carl Payne, jason weaver, and Darius Mccray and more",1374192000,,407,4.575342465753424

4830141,5,B005LS4MW8,"Had me from minute one. Great acting. Better ""movie advice"" about relationships than Steve Harvey's movie. Just a great way to spend a Saturday night after the kids are in bed. Perfectly paired with a glass of wine.  Watch this movie!",1371340800,,234,4.7073170731707314
4830142,5,B005LS4MW8,This one flew in under the radar.  I'm glad I purchased it.  A good romance with very interesting characters.  Definitely a good buy.,1371254400,,133,4.695652173913044

Movie n movie movie movie I see a movie it wasn't awful Ellen eke Romeo roe",1370390400,,90,3.55
4830144,5,B005LS4MW8,I enjoyed this movie. I didn't get a chance to watch the whole movie when it can on BET so I decided to purchase the movie and due to the reviews on amazon thought that it would not be a bad purchase. I was correct. This movie held my attention and the acting was really good as well.,1369180800,,284,3.913793103448276
4830145,4,B005LS4MW8,This was a great movie without having the players being nude. I really enjoy the movie. The movie wasn't a let down.,1367452800,,116,4.318181818181818
4830146,5,B005LS4MW8,I chose this rating cause the package came in the time frame that was given to me.  The package was brand new and for a good price.  I would shop with this company again.,1364428800,,170,3.9705882352941178
4830147,4,B005LS4MW8,"When the movie first began, I thought that it was going to be cheesy, but I was surprised! It had a good story line, and the acting was good.",1362441600,,141,3.896551724137931
4830148,5,B005LS4MW8,"This was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone, especially cocky women that don't think they men won't cheat. However,  if y got a good man don't test him bc you might just push into another womans hands!!!",1361491200,,217,4.2926829268292686
4830149,5,B005LS4MW8,The movie was very entertaining and I loved the quality of the pictures and the settings was very appealing to watch.,1360800000,,117,4.619047619047619
4830150,4,B005LS4MW8,I like  the plot of this movie testing men to see if their loyal or not and then the two women learn their lesson and see that tests aren't needed in relationships.,1357430400,,164,4.125
4830151,4,B005LS4MW8,This movie probably didn't get a bunch of stars because it shows a man being faithful. This movie provides us with a look at a relationship when lack of trust gets in the way. We see in this movie a Kent (Jason Weaver) who is not surrounded by temptation but is sent temptation (Mandy played by Caryn Ward) . The movie did a good job of showing us that not all of us are the same. I like how the movie let Kent's friend (played by Carl Payne) be the friend who always keeps it real with his homeboy. The movie kept it real and showed that Kent came very close to loosing to temptation. Kent's girlfriend (Gabrielle Dennis) must work on getting her man back. The movie reminds us that we all make mistakes but without forgiving relationships don't work. You should buy this movie for your collection.,1357344000,3,799,4.369127516778524
4830152,3,B005LS4MW8,"This movie offers a good story and has it's moments.  Not the type of movie you would rush out to the theater to see.  I enjoyed it, but it will be a while before I see it again.",1356480000,,178,3.6578947368421053
4830153,2,B005LS4MW8,The acting in this was ridiculously weak. I could have done better and have never acted or done drama a day in my life. I would give this movie away. I DON'T recommend purchasing this movie.,1352505600,,190,4.305555555555555
4830154,5,B005LS4MW8,"Great movie. I learned from it. I could place myself in Brooke's place. Always trying to push people, and expecting the unexpected from myself and others. I really relate to her character.",1345161600,,188,4.90625
4830155,5,B005LS4MW8,Who knew that this would be such a great movie?  It was good to see Cole (from Martin) in something.  This movie is very funny with a touch of love and lessons that the viewer can take with them through life.,1343865600,,208,4.048780487804878
4830156,5,B005LS4MW8,"Interesting take on love, trust, and growing in relationships.  You will enjoy this story with a few of your friends.",1343174400,,117,4.85
4830157,4,B005LS4MW8,I like black films! This was pretty good! I recommend this to anyone! The actors did a great job playing their roles!,1343174400,,117,4.363636363636363
4830158,5,B005LS4MW8,"A very good Black movie, and very entertaining. This movie shows that when trust is not in place it can turn on out to be threaten and also and more importantly that all men are not dogs. Excellent movie with out any violence and a movie that teenagers can really enjoy as well.",1343001600,,278,4.264150943396227
4830159,5,B005LS4MW8,I liked this movie a lot and I think the writer and actors did a great job. It's worth the money!,1341100800,,97,3.6666666666666665
4830160,5,B005LS4MW8,"I have to say this movie was Hilarious!!! I can watch it again just to laugh at the dumb stuff they were doing...many LOL and ROTF moments.  Cute, funny, romantic, thought provoking (some women need to stop playing games), definitely warrants a review.",1340496000,,252,4.8604651162790695
4830161,5,B005LS4MW8,"To be honest this was the last movie on my list to watch. I rented it on a whim after looking at the reviews. Let me say this, this movie is great and  it tells a full story. It's ""Hitch"" and "" Two Can Play That Game""  combined but 10X better. Lika another reviewer said it should have been in the theater. I hope the play this on BET or TVone.",1336780800,,344,3.8309859154929575
4830162,5,B005LS4MW8,"I saw this movie this past weekend. And, to be honest after reading the movie summary I expected a mediocre, predictable romantic black comedy. It doesn't feature your highly sought after black actresses or actors (read:Tyler Perry) but it's a good mix of well known and not so well known. Jason Weaver, the lead role, is endearing, sweet, and very real. Gabrielle Dennis plays a familiar stuck up role much like her character in The Game. Carl Anthony Payne is hilarious, and the relationship he has with Jason Weaver was genuine and a great example of how men are. I rewatched it with my boyfriend and he laughed out loud plenty of times and enjoyed it as well. Not the best cinematography, and it won't win an NAACP award but its a great date movie, and it opens up alot of interesting discussions about dating, men, and women.",1334620800,4,830,4.614864864864865
4830163,4,B005LS4MW8,"This was a interesting tale of how a good relationship can be put in danager without trust.  I enjoyed the movie, but the plot wasn't very honest, but thats what movies are for; fairy tale endings.  However, I was very happy to see Jason Weaver in something again, I belive he's a good actor and is often times forgotten about. I hope to see him a little more in some of these independent productions.  Keep the tells coming.",1334534400,,425,4.423076923076923
4830164,5,B005LS4MW8,"This movie was really well done. The theme of the movie was a little unrealistic for me. Checking to see if your man is cheating is normal, but one of the main characters took it too far. This, and only this, was unrealistic. Everything else played out wonderfully. The acting was good. It was refreshing to see Jason Weaver in this type of role. Caryn Ward usually does well (HU!!!). Gabrielle Dennis was good, but all I could do was think about Janay and the insurance commercial. To me, the star of the show was Carl Anthony.  You know- Cole from ""Martin"" or Cockroach from ""Cosby Show."" He was just so good in this movie!!! He was funny and very believable. I really hope he gets more roles that are well written. Though Carl Anthony (please don't be mad if I revert to Cockroack or Cole) is the eternal sidekick, this movie really displayed his acting chops, and I'm wondering what he would do as a lead.",1333065600,3,909,4.4431137724550895
4830165,5,B005LS4MW8,SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT DO AND THIS WOMEN WENT TOO FAR TO SEE IF HER BOYFRIEND WOULD CHEAT AND IT COST HER DEARLY!!! GREAT LESSON WHEN YOU DON'T TRUST YOUR MAN AND YOU PUT ANOTHER WOMEN IN HIS FACE. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS DVD!!!,1330992000,,228,4.088888888888889
4830166,5,B005LS4MW8,"I loved the story line. Great modern love story and a good lesson on the importance of ""trust"" in relationships. I expected it to be low rate because it was not a movie that had been in the theatres. However, I was very impressed at how great the movie was put together. It can compete with any movie you'd see in theatres. The actors could ""act,"" they were all good looking - great hair and makeup. The scenes, wardrobe and locations were good. What does the black community have to do to see movies like these in theatres. This was my first purchase on Amazon and I was shocked to see so many black movies and actors that I hadn't heard of. It's 2012 for God's sake. The black community needs to ""occupy"" hollywood and make this change.",1329177600,14,738,4.355072463768116

4830168,5,B005LS4MW8,"I gave this movie a 5 star rating because it was funny, filmed well, and engaging.

4830171,4,B005LS4MW8,"This movie is an experiment in modern love. The inquiring mind of women versus the strong sex drive of men. Does a woman need to test her lover to prove his fidelity? Can a man escape the wiles of a woman for hire, seeking to prove his infidelity?

The twists and turns in the movie were highly unexpected and yet predictable. I love how they portray the main character. He is the average dream guy. While most fairy tales create the leading man as a wealthy prince come to save his damsel, this romantic tale presents the blue-collar dream guy; faithful, romantic, sweet, human, and oh-so-real.

This is a definite couples movie. It will incite great dialogue between you and your partner. It is also perfect for PMS blues... in other words, chick flick!

There are several familiar faces in this movie. Jason Weaver, our leading man, does an excellent job. He is so natural in front of the camera as well as playing the good boyfriend. His portrayal was heartfelt and a breath of fresh air. I'm tired of male-bashing movies and am glad to see a movie about a good guy.",1326672000,15,1070,4.533678756476684
4830172,3,B005LS4MW8,"It's funny to see that some of the cast from the hit tv show ""The Game"" is in this movie.
The quality of the movie was great, but the scenario and how it played out wasn't realistic to me, but I guess it was an okay movie for those movie lovers who like romance and comedy. :/",1326585600,,276,3.8596491228070176
