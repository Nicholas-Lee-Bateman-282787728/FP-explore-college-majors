387159,4,6301966163,I SEEN THIS MOVIE ALSO.  I ENJOYED WATCHING ONE OF MY FAVIORITE ACTRESS JAMI LEE CURTIS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO 18 OR OLDER.,1394668800,,134,4.32
387160,3,6301966163,"I have nothing against the actors themselves because they are good actors, but not in this movie. Mariel Hemingway portrayed Dorothy better in Star 80 than Jamie Lee Curtis did in this movie. Jamie looked nothing like her nor did she act like Dorothy. Bruce Weitz was a poor imitation of Paul Snider, whereas Eric Roberts was amazing as Paul Snider. In general, I think it was poorly cast. The story itself was ok.",1394236800,4,414,4.608108108108108
387161,3,6301966163,"This 1981 made-for-TV docudrama depicts the life of murdered glamour model/actress Dorothy Stratten.  It features Jamie Lee Curtis as shy, sensitive Dorothy Hoogstraten who is plucked from the obscurity of her Vancouver town by a lowlife pimp, Paul Snider (played by the middle-aged Bruce Weitz).

I didn't hate the movie, unlike some other viewers.  It is somewhat entertaining and Jamie Lee definitely captures Dorothy's sweetness, although she lacks the bombshell beauty that Dorothy had.  I will admit that I teared up a bit during certain scenes in the movie, like when Dorothy was being cautioned about avoiding Paul and how she decided to leave Vancouver for Hollywood anyway.  Jamie Lee Curtis nailed the vulnerability and innocence of Dorothy to a T.  You can see how worried everyone is about her, but she seems destined for both fame and tragedy.

My biggest issues with the movie were as follows...the Paul Snider character, for starters.  Paul was older than Dorothy in real life, yes, but only by 8 years.  Bruce Weitz was at least 50 in this movie.  What the heck?!  Paul was 29 when he died.  He was a streetwise dude, but come on, he wasn't some geezer with a raspy voice and weathered looks.

Second, the family relationship.  After doing some research, I now know that Dorothy's mother and sister wanted to be portrayed as her aunt and cousin instead.  I guess because it was only a year after Dorothy's murder and it was still too painful.  And from what I read, Louise was bullied a bit in school after her sister died, so maybe it was better to alter some of the facts.  Still, that might be confusing for viewers who don't know much about the real events.

And third, it is painfully low-budget.  If you're looking for a relatively simple movie about Dorothy Stratten, check this one out.  But if you want a more sophisticated, complex version I recommend ""Star 80"".  Maybe I'm biased because I love Bob Fosse's work but ""Star 80"" is an excellent portrayal of what really happened, right down to the brutal murder-suicide (which is filmed in the actual apartment where it happened).  Like Jamie Lee Curtis, Mariel Hemingway doesn't have the striking beauty that Dorothy had, but she does a fine job in ""Star 80"".

And unlike this movie, ""Star 80"" gets it right with their portrayal of the real Paul Snider.  Eric Roberts is the right age, unlike Bruce Weitz, and he conveys the essence of Paul much more convincingly.",1373587200,5,2440,4.782296650717703
387162,5,6301966163,"This movie has saddest, drama and exciting. The actress plays a good  Dorothy Stratten. I recommend all my friends to buy this movie because they all going to like it a lot.

387163,2,6301966163,"In terms of realism, Death Of A Centerfold manages to get some of the bare-bones facts of the Dorothy Stratten/Paul Snider story correct. I suppose the kindest thing I can say about this made-for-tv movie is that because of the very milieu it was working in, expectations shouldn't be as high as that of a feature-length motion picture. The broad outlines of the tale (young Canadian girl is wooed by a small-time hustler, through this association eventually becomes a Playboy playmate, marries the hustler then parlays her Playboy exposure into some minor tv appearances and film roles before being murdered by her estranged husband) are presented intact. I guess the problem for me is that I saw this movie after having read a good deal and viewed a fair amount of film about the actual people involved. Jamie Lee Curtis is okay, I suppose, although she doesn't look anything like Stratten (and let's be honest: Curtis wasn't unattractive but hardly representative of a Playmate). Robert Reed plays a watered-down character based on Peter Bogdanovich, which provides little more than the sort of staid, stilted performance one would expect from a lifelong tv actor. The ridiculousness REALLY comes into the fore whenever Hill St. Blues alumni Bruce Weitz (the scruffy undercover detective who used to call everyone 'dogface') is onscreen. Weitz was inexplicably chosen to play Paul Snider. Snider was in his mid-to-late twenties when he was involved with Stratten. Weitz looks like he's pushing 50 here, and keeps peppering his dialogue with expressions like 'don't try to jive me, baby'...oh, it's just silly beyond belief to anyone who has even so much as seen photos of the real people. If one is looking for a dramatized version of the Dorothy Stratten story, the only undertaking of any merit is still the 1983 movie Star 80: as grim as that film is, at least one can watch it without bursting into laughter every time the Paul Snider character is onscreen. This dvd is part of the Warner Archive collection, thus there are no extras, and it's in fullscreen DVD-R format.",1372377600,5,2078,4.957020057306591
387164,2,6301966163,"This vendor was fine but the movie was terrible.  If you are a Dorothy Stratton fan, don't buy this movie!",1313539200,,106,4.3
387165,3,6301966163,"What can you say about this ripped from the headlines TV movie?  It's not particularly exploitive but it's not that great either.  It holds your interest but after viewing it you shrug your shoulders.  Jamie Lee Curtis, one of our great unsung actresses (should have scored an Oscar nom for her work in ""True Lies"" or ""Freaky Friday"" for that matter), is merely adequate as Dorothy Stratten.  Robert Reed, playing a Peter Bogdanovich type, is merely laughable.  The only performance that grabs your interest is Bruce Weitz's(Mick Belker from ""Hill Street Blues"") for all the wrong reasons.  Granted that the film's title telegraphs it's ominous conclusion Weitz chews the scenery to such a degree as Paul Snider that we have no doubts about his culpability.  Do yourself a favor and check out Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" and particularly Eric Roberts multilayered turn as Snider.  ""Galaxina"" is a must but avoid Bogdanovich's ""They All Laughed"" at all costs.",1267920000,,952,5.019108280254777
387166,3,6301966163,"I have to say that this version is interesting, with the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis (the ""Scream Queen""), one of my favorite actresses as Dorothy, although she doesn't bear much of a resemblance. Although I think that Bob Fosse's ""STAR 80"" is better, this version has something good going for it - the inner strength that Dorothy discovers, but she is still unable to save herself. (Maybe the fact that a woman directed it had some influence). Bruce Weitz is overbearing as Snider, but he seems a bit too old. Remember, Paul Snider was 29 when he died. This film's version of events leading up to the crime doesn't quite feel right, but no matter. It's a cut above a lot of other TV movies. But if you want something closer to the real story, watch ""STAR 80"". This one will do, though.",1141257600,6,786,4.465277777777778
387167,2,6301966163,"This made-for-TV movie called for a better production which came in the form of ""Star 80"" two years later.  Not much use in bashing this one, but it is not well cast, the acting is uneven, and it is factually inaccurate.

Bless you, Dorothy, wherever you are.",1122854400,9,259,4.48936170212766

7817893,3,6301966163,"TV movie quality.  A somewhat factual account of the true life murder. Jamie Lee Curtis was OK but I felt (from reading Peter Bogdanovich's Killing of the Unicorn) that Dorothy's sweetness of character was not really shown. The other characters (Bruce Weitz, Robert Reed, etc) did not really truly represent the real life men who make up this story. This is an interesting but sleazy story of innocence lost in the hinterlands of Hollywood in 1980.  This movie did not really capture that entirely.",1428969600,3,498,4.916666666666667
