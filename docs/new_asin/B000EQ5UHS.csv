2528300,3,B000EQ5UHS,"You think you know the story of Little Red Riding Hood?  Well, forget everything you think you know, because ""Hoodwinked"" sets the story straight.  ""Hoodwinked"" is the true story of Little Red Riding Hood, told from the points of view of Red Riding Hood (Hathaway), the Big Bad Wolf (Warburton), the Woodsman (Belushi), and Granny (Close).  While being questioned by Nicky Flippers (Stiers), the four tell their side of the story, and none are what you will expect.  It seems that there is more going on than meets the eye here, and Mr. Flippers is going to get to the bottom of it.

""Hoodwinked"" is an interesting twist on a classic story.  That classic story is just a jumping point for all that is going on behind the scenes, and that will all come together to give the story that we all know.  The voice talents are all good, but not outstanding.  The animation is sub-par though, looking like something made for TV.  That is the film's biggest downfall.  In an age where Pixar has spoiled moviegoing audiences, the animation in this film is at times painful.  Kids will probably love it though, and that is all that really matters I suppose, since they are the target audience.",1137715200,9,1182,4.634615384615385
2528301,4,B000EQ5UHS,"The plot was well written I must say; however, action still tends to lean more towards children (obviously).  I'm 28 and it was still watchable to me, however.  Worth a rent. Try to find all the pop culture references within the movie.  The characters are so zany!",1137542400,3,264,4.574468085106383
2528302,5,B000EQ5UHS,"We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but could there have possibly been something more? The answer couldn't have been more inovative and flat out hillarious than 'Hoodwinked'. This fairy tale is turned into a classic 'Who Done It?' mystery as the police of the enchanted woods try to find out who is swiping sweets recepies. Red, The Wolf, the Woodsman and yes even Granny are all suspectes caught up in it.

What amazed me about this movie was it was a very short story entirly, but it was told in 4 different ways. Each 'suspect' was doing a completly different thing and all four came together in the end. Each story was origional and funny and that's what made me enjoy it so much. The characters were voiced to perfection and the songs would put a smile on anyones face.

This movie really came out of nowhere and even became the top grosser in it's opening week. If you are up for a fun time at the movies 'Hoodwinked' will not disappoint.",1137456000,,957,4.431818181818182
2528303,4,B000EQ5UHS,"What do you get when you combine a traditional Grimm Fairy Tale with extreme sports, a goodie heist, and street cred?  ""Hoodwinked,"" that's what.  ""Hoodwinked"" is a hilarious re-telling of the old ""Little Red Riding Hood"" story.  I had my doubts when I first entered the movie theater, especially since many critics hammered it.  However, and as in most cases, the professional critics were wrong.  This family comedy will have everyone laughing in the aisles.  There are plenty of things in this film to laugh at for youngsters, teens, and oldsters alike.

The tale starts off traditionally enough, with ""Little Red"" going to visit her dear sweet Granny in the forest.  However, things happen along the way that just don't add up.  Once we get to the climax of the traditional tale, all chaos cuts loose.  There is a domestic disturbance called into the police, all of which happen to be animals.  Mr. Flippers, a frog, investigates the crime and somehow ties it to a recent string of goodie recipe thefts.

One by one we are re-told the tale by Red, Granny, the Woodsman, and, of course, the Big Bad Wolf.  Each tale neatly ties up any loose ends from the previous tale.  We get to see the tale from all four points of view.  In the end, all of the tales are tied together with one thing in mind, and, honestly, most adults will probably pick up on this from the beginning.

Younger kids may not be able to tie all of the ends together, but there are plenty of silly laughs for them.  The story never slows down, and I have to admit that it's one of the funniest comedies, live-action or animated, in a long while.

Anne Hathaway provides the voice of Red.  She does quite well with this departure from the prim and proper princess roles she's well known for.  Glenn Close is Granny in a hilarious twist on the sweet ol' coot.  Patrick Warburton plays the Wolf, and he and his squirrel companion steal the show.  The Woodsman is portrayed by Jim Belushi.  Other surprises in this flick are Andy Dick, Anthony Anderson, and Xzibit.

Overall, this is a wonderful film to take the entire family to see.  Had I no children, I'd still enjoy this film for the simple fact that it is a wonderful comedy worthy of multiple viewings.  I will definitely purchase this one when it hits the DVD rack.

Highly recommended.",1137283200,,2311,4.573170731707317
2528304,4,B000EQ5UHS,"Was the Wolf framed? Is there more to Red-Riding Hood than her keen deductive ability and her hood? ""HOODWINKED"" asks these questions in a film more family friendly than SHREK. Sure, comparison to the SHREK films in unavoidable when twisting fairy tales. But Hoodwinked has it's own style, although it is a less slick style than Pixar or Dreamworks. Just with more quirky songs and more awkward charm.

HOODWINKED,is a FRACTURED FAIRY TALE in the spirit of Jon Scieszka's The True Story of the Three Little Pigs. The movieopens like a traditional telling of Red-Riding Hood,with ""Red"" voiced by Anne Hathaway taking goodies to Granny, voiced by Glenn Close, she finds the wolf, a woodsman (Jim Belushi) leaps in with an ax.....then the police arrive. The best Of these retellings are by the Wolf, voiced by Patrick Warburton, and Granny. The Wolf reveals that he is an undercover reporter who not only dresses like Chevy Chase's Fletch, but he shares Fletch's disguise kit and soundtrack. Warburton plays the Wolf perfectly in every scene.  Granny's retaling parodies ""XXX"" in her taste for extreme sports is revealed. Other notable voices and cameos by Andy Dick, David Ogden Stiers and Xzbit.

The film is loaded with great one-liners, pop references and gags that will appeal to all-ages.",1137196800,67,1291,5.0233644859813085

2528552,3,B000EQ5UHS,"A surprisingly entertaining film that sort of plays on the Rashomon theme of different characters (of the Red Riding Hood story) humorously telling their various accounts of the ""Grandma's house"" incident to a police inspector. I was expecting this to be one to skip but was really surprised that this was entertaining, and funny, both as a kids film as well as for adults. The film is fine as an all-ages family film without anything bad other than a couple suspenseful scenes for small viewers. Fans of the Kronk character from ""Emperor's new Groove/Kronk's Groove"" (voiced by Patrick Warburton) will get a kick out of hearing his voice as the Wolf. There were quite a few other big names voicing characters for the film and it was an interesting guessing game if you go to watch this without reading the credits (I was convinced the frog detective was Kenneth Branagh, not David Ogden Stiers. My bad.)  There are quite a few humorous moments in the film that had everyone laughing, including the yodeling mountain goat in the coal car as well as Wolf's squirrel friend and his reaction to caffeinated coffee.

The biggest negative of the film thought would be the animation that, at times, really looks awful. Red Riding Hood's face looks like a garden gnome figurine - not sure if that was intentional or just bad animation. The faces of the human characters just looked low-quality in general. Likewise some of the water effects when the Wolf is washed away just look sub par, like something out of a computer animated film from the late 90's. This was distracting in a number of places. I guess I'm spoiled by some of the higher-end animated features that inferior animation like this stand out more. Otherwise this was a funny family film with a silly story, ideal for all ages.",1444003200,,1785,4.754838709677419

2528605,3,B000EQ5UHS,"Quick story recap: A thief has been stealing recipes around the forest which leads to questioning of Little Red Riding hood and her grandmother's sweets business.  A somewhat of a who done it/action animation film.  It's watchable for adults, I'm sure it's amazing for kids.  It was an interesting take on the story of Little Red Riding Hood with each player in that story giving their angle of the story.

 Everything about this movie just feels average -not bad, but not really good which is to say you won't be disappointed but you also won't be in love with it.  There are some good actors lending voice talents, some funny side bits with smaller characters but much of the movie and jokes just wind up being less than desired.  I purchased the movie having only remembered seeing parts of it, it looked interesting enough however, I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I seen it fully before.  I think if you are shopping here - it's a rental unless you are shopping for someone in the age range of 3 to 10.",1419811200,,1016,4.543956043956044

Actually the second one was far more entertaining, action packed and loaded with jokes and references entertaining for adults. My three and a half yr. old granddaughter did love Hoodwinked, but I found it a bit flat in comparison to Hoodwinked 2.  I think it is because they expanded on each character and made them more full bodied than the first one. It was fun, but it may not keep younger kids as entertained as Hoodwinked 2.",1403222400,,525,4.684782608695652

My family and I thoroughly loved this movie when it hit the theaters, and it remains highly entertaining.  Someone is robbing all the goodie places in Red's World, and the Law comes in to determine who the crook might be.

2528695,5,B000EQ5UHS,"I love this movie. Its so funny, especially the Wolf. The movie starts at the end of the traditional Little Red Riding Hood, with the police showing up to try and question each one as to what happened. Each one has their own version as to what happened. From Little Red Riding Hood's point of view it looked like the Wolf was trying to kill her. Then you get to the Wolf's story next, he's an reporter investigating the Goody Bandit and thinks Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are the bandits. All of his weird and scary behavior is explained easily, his tail gets caught in the camera causing him to scream in pain, Red doesn't see this only that he lets out a scary roar. The ax man is actually an actor who got a call back, and Granny is into extreme sports. Its a funny movie full of funny moments as each one tells their tales of their journey to Granny's house. The Wolf question other bake shops, and visits his snitch a sheep, a mafia sheep, and while wearing disguises. He has a coffee-addicted squirrel friend, Wolf has tons of funny one-liners and full of sarcasm. Red runs into a goat cursed by witch he can only sing everything he says, except at one point he doesn't and Red points it out to him. The goat also has horns for everything including campfire set, laundry, and with hair.  Granny turns out to be completely badass and very into extreme sports. The cops are funny like when Red says Wolf was creepy, Flippers says they don't throw people in jail just for being creepy, cue one of the cops who calls the jailhouse telling them to let the creepy guy go. This is a very, very funny movie.",1398902400,4,1620,4.364238410596027

I also used to show this movie at the end of a week long reading unit for my 3rd grade students where we studied Lon Po Po and compared it to alternate versions of the Little Red Riding Hood story.

The story is re-told from the perspective of several different characters...so it's a neat demonstration of how a single event can be interpreted differently by each participant.  AND, it's fun to watch little red riding hood as a sort of crime drama... It is not the standard Grimm version.

It goes places you probably wish it wouldn't. Also, it's one of only two Andy Dick movies I would EVER recommend. The other being the sequel: Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil

2528892,1,B000EQ5UHS,"Not a bad idea -- the idea of treating it as something of a crime story is different, and I liked that as a start -- but it's badly executed. Clumsy 3-D animation that might have been cutting edge a dozen years ago doesn't help. All the eyes are flat and expressionless, as are the faces, no matter what kinds of gymnastics the eyebrows go through. Voice characterizations are excellent for all the major characters, but the plot is wooden, despite the interesting premise, and far too much effort and attention is devoted to making the movie ""relevant"" (e.g., by having a Granny who snowboards). The squirrel character is easily the worst of the bunch, but fortunately, the squirrel character doesn't take up that much screen time. Overall, I thought this one a bust from beginning to end. The Fox reviewer quoted on the front of the DVD case for this particular edition says it's ""...the funniest animated movie since 'Shrek,'"" which is not only woefully inaccurate, but does a huge disservice to any number of animated films made since 'Shrek' by several different studios, all of which are more skillfully done than this turkey.",1366761600,,1132,4.81025641025641

My wife and I laughed hysterically when we saw that and knew that we wanted to see Hoodwinked. And we laughed all the way through it!

At the end, when everything is explained, it all comes together nicely.  It really is a funny movie and not everything is predictable. There were some surprises too. We thought the animation was great, especially the opening scene and the scenes when they go back through the book.

It used to be, long ago, that cartoons were either Disney fluff with barely any plot, or, consisted of a series of slapsticks pratfalls, also with barely any plot. Hoodwinked takes a good story, the Little Red Riding Hood story and tells it from the different views of the wolf, the axman, Red, and Granny, each with a secret. The cartoon has its facial distortions and occasional slapstick to appeal to the kids, but there are also a lot of humor directed towards adults (e.g., the wolf complains about being automatically blamed, ""Talk about profiling"").

""Hoodwinked"" is a movie about Little Red Riding Hood bringing treats to her grandmother, which of course there is a wolf in her place.  From that point the story becomes a crime scene and more characters are introduced.  Someone is stealing recipes and each character tells their version of the story.  My favorite part is the Woodsman and his Schnitzel singing skit - think Schnitzel truck instead of ice cream truck!  The DVD doesn't have any inappropriate scenes that I remember, but it may be a little hard to understand for young kids.  My boys thought the music was funny and loved all the funny characters, mainly the different animals!  It is a movie I could watch more than once because there is a lot going on in the scenes and I love the music!  It really is a cute movie!

2529154,4,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked is a funnier take on the classic fairy tale. It all starts out the same,Red Riding Hood (voiced by Anne Hathaway) is visiting her Granny (voiced by Glenn Close) only to find the wolf (voiced by Patrick Warburton) in her bed and Granny is tied up in the closet when a Woodsman shows up and all hell breaks loose.  This is where it gets fun, Red is a butt kicking, street smart, unafraid girl, and the wolf an investigative reporter. Granny can ride a snowboard as well as Shaun White!

Next thing you know, the cottage is surrounded by police tape and Red, Wolf, Granny and the Woodsman are being interrogated by Nicky Flippers (voiced by David Ogden Stiers, M*A*S*H).

I liked the movie and appreciate the character styles and pop culture references. Goddess and I watched it three times in a week, so obviously she liked it too! Not your typical cartoon. Very well done. Witty and very well voiced. My favorite character was the Andy Dick voiced Bunny while my 5 year old love Twitchy.

Personally, I liked it better the 3rd time I watched it. The first two times, I felt there was too much down time and less laughs than I expected.

Good for the whole family and everyone will have a favorite character and enjoy their character's take on what happened.",1296691200,,1267,4.563876651982379
2529155,4,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked is a refreshing, outside-the-box take on various fairy tales.  That is filled with great absurdist humor.  Yeah, the animation is quite low budget.  But, the top notch writing and voice acting more than make up for it.",1294963200,,229,4.973684210526316
2529156,4,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked takes some well known fairy tale characters and turns them on their ear. The focus of the story is a mystery, narrated in the Dragnet style. That was enough to keep me amused while my nine year old granddaughter laughed at the sillier aspects of the movie.

I also found the story to be cleverly intricate, which also kept my attention. Many isolated events which don't seem to make sense as you witness them singly are wrapped up when the ending explained what was really happening.

The voice talent includes a surprisingly rich cast, with stars like Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, James Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, and Andy Dick. The performances are convincing and amusing. Animation is in a cartoon style, with vibrant but flat-textured colors. Still, I thought it had an attractive look.

As a disclaimer I'll have to say that my son and daughter-in-law, who have to watch (or at least listen) to the film often ... since my granddaughter likes it a lot ... rather than the one time I viewed it, seem to find it a bit annoying at times, especially around the yodeling parts, I think. LOL However, I was not annoyed by any of it, which is a real plus for programming aimed at kids these days. (I don't last long, for example, when my granddaughter has current day Disney channel programs on the TV).

Therefore I recommend this movie highly for kids, and for limited viewings by their parents. LOL",1294531200,,1448,4.734126984126984

2529158,1,B000EQ5UHS,"This was a bad animated movie on a lot of different levels. Great voice acting though! The story was a crime drama with 4 of the classic characters being interrogated about a recipe thief by a frog inspector. Animation was stiff, the characters were ugly, textures were very ugly and pretty basic. Without spoiling it, they do take the characters and twist them like the Woodsman isn't really a Woodsman, the Wolf is a misunderstood good guy and the granny is acting like a teenager. There's a joke a second. Its kind of like Family guy where they just come up with random stuff and throw it at a wall to see what sticks. There are a lot of chuckles. When it focused on the plot, it seemed very predictable. If anything, this movie is for kids, but it seems like teens would like it with all of its innuendos.",1289865600,4,809,4.4
2529159,5,B000EQ5UHS,This is a hilarious adaptation of the classic story of Little Red Riding hood. I love it and what's more important is my toddler daughter loves it.,1284076800,,147,4.481481481481482
2529160,3,B000EQ5UHS,"In my opinion the fairy tale as source material for an animated feature spans two extremes: On the one end is Shrek (and it's seemingly never ending sequels) and the other are the Happily N'ever After films. Shrek does things properly with an original, witty, and engaging tale in the forefront and classic fairy tale spoofs and references thrown about for good measure.  Better still they often integrate pop culture references with the medieval setting which is humorous by virtue of contrast alone.

Happily Ever After went a more direct route in its approach: Take a classic, add a few silly twists and call it something new.  Now in my opinion this is certainly the less desirable of the two extremes.

For this story, we begin at the end. Furry and feathered cops from the animal world are investigating a domestic disturbance at Granny's cottage, involving a girl, a wolf, and an axe-wielding madman.

The impatient Chief Grizzly arrests them all on the scene while Detective Nicky Flipper interviews the accused to gather each of their own version of the incident and the events leading up to it.

What unfolds is a massive conspiracy threatening the entire animal world's economic stability as candy recipes of the goody shops have been stolen by the Goody Bandit, and here in fairy tale land, sweets aren't just snacks, they're the currency of the forest!

Hoodwinked falls firmly in the middle of the scale with a tale that starts out as classical material (in this case Little Red Riding Hood) and throws in a wide variety of both cultural and sociological references.  It also makes pretty amusing use of the POV (point of view) method of story telling to weave a singular tale.

The laughs aren't constant and the animation is obviously a few notches below what moviegoers have come to expect from the president set by Pixar, DreamWorks, and Blue Sky but that doesn't mean Hoodwinked doesn't shine in its own unique way.

The vocal cast for one thing offers up a fantastic variety of appropriate flavors.  Rapper turned reality show television host Xzibit dazzles as the thick-necked Chief Grizzly, Glenn Close delivers the goods as Triple G: The extreme sports addicted granny and Seinfeld's ever-monotonous Patrick Warburton's rendition of the big bad wolf is nothing if not spot-on.

The story itself is rife with originality and some interesting twists on the classical tale about a young girl on her way to granny's place.  I can't say I'm particularly enamored with the whole fairy-tale turned modern comedy genre of computer animated feature films but Hoodwinked is solid enough to remind that with enough creativity and heart, an antiquated story can be made into something appreciated by viewers of any age and background.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect about this one is that it manages to play ball with some of the blockbusters in animation on an absolute shoestring budget.  The response to this film was positive enough to warrant development of a soon-to-be-released sequel and that in and of itself is nothing to sneeze at!",1283644800,,3058,4.9453125
2529161,4,B000EQ5UHS,Writing this review before heading out tonight.  I saw this one last week with my four nieces (ages 7 to 13) and I have to say it's one of those movies that adults and kids can both enjoy.  There are several A list actor/actress voices (see below for names) in this RASHOMON style picture that favors comedy even though it has a pretty good well paced structure.  It was nice to hear the voice David Ogden Steir as well (the Charles dude from M.A.S.H.).  MY GRADE: B plus.,1282867200,,472,4.329545454545454

2529163,5,B000EQ5UHS,"This is my favorite movie ever. It starts off with the original fairy tale, then gets crazier and wackier further on, until it suddenly ends with an evil bunny chasing down a granny on a muffin tin above a cable car. And it all makes SENSE, too. The animation isn't that great, but I don't mind--it makes the characters seem somehow doll-like, which I think is perfect for a fairy tale retelling. The mood switches from comically serious--the Wolf's story--to crazily insane--lumberjack!--and back again. I especially love how the villain is the bunny, the adorable little Boingo, the last person anyone would ever expect. My whole family adores this movie, from my dad to my five-year-old sister. When my friend and I first saw it, we spent months afterward quoting random lines from it. We still do, sometimes. It's THAT good.",1273881600,,828,4.879432624113475

2529179,5,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked first came across my attention a month ago while channel-surfing. The movie is another take on the Grimm's Fairy Tale, Little Red Riding Hood, and purports to tell ""the real story"". While stories of ""the other point-of-view"" are nothing new, many are widely successful (Gregory Maguire's Wicked, for example). Hoodwinked deserves to be in the ranks of such success stories.

What sets Hoodwinked apart from others is that rather than settling one viewpoint, the film tells the story of all of the players: the Wolf's, the Woodsman's, and even Granny's. In the fairy tale, Red is seen as an innocent child performing a family errand and accosted by the personification of evil. But in Hoodwinked, Red is a delivery girl for a local business, and the Wolf is fleshed out as an intrepid reporter who mistakenly believes Red is responsible for a rash of thefts in the neighborhood. His foray into cross-dressing is simply an attempt to get to the truth. Even the woodsman, believed by Grimm to be a hero, becomes a clumsy oaf whose role in the adventure is best left unsaid. As for Granny, well, her beehive hairdo is merely a cover for a woman most people would love to have as a grandparent! Glenn Close does a magnificent job voicing this spry, sly, surprising grandmother.

The cast is supplemented by several supporting cast members such as Japeth the Goat, Twitchy the Squirrel, and Boingo the Rabbit (superbly voiced by Andy Dick). But rather than relegating such characters to bland, background chorus roles as you would find in a Disney film, Kanbar Entertainment gives each one a separate identity, and an important part to play. Yes, some of them do sing--the music in this film is quite good--but it is music that Walt would never approve of.

After seeing only half the film, I promptly ordered the DVD, and it now occupies a place of honor in the rack beside other animation greats such as The Incredibles, and The Simpsons. I plan to get the soundtrack as well.

Director Cory Edwards has written a sequel, titled Hoodwinked Too: Hood vs. Evil, which centers on Hansel & Gretel. I look forward to see this next year.",1258329600,,2138,4.78590785907859

Shrek easily has five star quality but loses stars quickly on fart jokes and sexual innuendo. Hoodwinked is good decent fun but only 4 star quality.",1258156800,,486,4.7976190476190474

2529198,5,B000EQ5UHS,"My kids loved this movie so much I had to write a review about even though 162 people gave their opinion about it before me!  I am not sure why I missed this treasure when it was out in the movie theaters, but I did, and we happened to come across it one night at our local Blockbuster.  We brought it home and it was love at first sight for my daughter.  After 74 showings and 4 rentals later, we decided to buy our own copy.

The story behind Hoodwinked is well chronicled in other reviews. so I will not belabor that point.  It is basically a whodunit about Little Red Riding Hood, her ultra hip Grandmother, the investigative reporting wolf, and an out of work actor who moonlights as a truck driver selling Schnitzel-on-a-stick to all the children in the forest!  All four characters are implicated in the ruckus that breaks out at Granny's house and each character gets to tell their version of events leading up to the arrival of the police.  Needless to say, the stories don't jive, yet each one weaves in and out of the other characters' stories.

Patrick Warburton could not have been a better choice as the wolf.  His delivery is fantastic, and he plays homage to one of my favorite movies ""Fletch"" both in attitude and dress.  I know that you always recognize his distinct voice when he does a voiceover for an animated character, but you almost lose that sense of it when you see what a terrific jobs he does embodying the character of the wolf.  The other pleasant surprise is the voice-over of Glenn Close as Granny.  Despite watching this movie over 150 times and counting, you still don't know it's her.  Andy Dick voices the maniacal bunny Boingo, and he too embodies the part.  Great casting!

My kid have watched virtually all of the animated films of the last 8 years, as well as the oldies but goodies from years gone by, and this is by far my daughter's favorite movie.  She will forego Blue's' Clues, Dora, Sid the Science Kid, and Little Einsteins if she is able to find where Mommy hid the movie and flip it into the DVD player.  As with most of the animated features offered today, there is plenty of grown up humor in the movie as well and I enjoy watching the movie as much as my kids do.  I never thought Little Red Riding Hood could be so much fun, but it is!  You WILL enjoy this movie.  And if you don't--feel free to send your copy to my house--chances are I will need it to replace the one in current use after our 1000th viewing!",1247443200,6,2465,4.375824175824176
2529199,5,B000EQ5UHS,"--Nicky Flippers, voiced by David Ogden Stiers

Hoodwinked is a hilarious spoof of Little Red Riding Hood; in this exceptional tale not every character is what they seem to be at first blush and there's plenty of character development along the way. The animation may not be state of the art but when the story is this creative and funny, who cares? The voiceovers are very well done and the plot moves along nicely; I didn't feel bored and the plot twists helped make the story engaging. Great!

The action actually begins near the end of the story so the film is essentially a flashback. It seems that a little girl named Red (voiced by Anne Hathaway) is on her way to visit her grandmother (voiced by Glenn Close) in the forest. She meets the wolf (voiced by Patrick Warburton); and Red mistakenly thinks the wolf is trying to harm her. Red also has some quality time with her friend Boingo the rabbit (voiced by Andy Dick) who is sadly almost completely out of work. Red's granny is inexplicably tied up in her closet when Red arrives; and the wolf is wearing a granny disguise in granny's own bed! And why is there a woodsman (voiced by Jim Belushi) crashing through granny's window screaming and wielding an axe? There is much to straighten out here.

Meanwhile, there's another plot of great importance. There's a ""bandit"" who has been stealing all of the recipes for goodies and nobody can figure out who the criminal is! When Police Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) arrives with other police officers including Detective Bill Stork (voiced by Anthony Anderson), an investigation begins--but it is interrupted and pushed aside by the suave, debonair detective Nicky Flippers the frog (voiced by David Ogden Stiers).

Flippers has everyone tell their version of the story: Red's granny, Red herself, the wolf and the woodsman. Of course, we learn more about what happens from each and every version of the story that we get--but still we are not quite close to solving the puzzle of just who is the recipe thief even after all their testimony. That's when Nicky Flippers, Red and even Granny get involved with a most unlikely thief; and when trouble starts and Red's life is on suddenly on the line it's soon up to Granny and some others to help her!

Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Who IS the ""goodie bandit"" and what is their ultimate goal? Will Red's friends be able to rescue her in time; and why has Red's grandmother kept some pretty big secrets from her? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with some nice bonus features. We get deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary; a feature commentary by writer/director Cory Edwards, writer/co-director Tony Leech and writer/co-director Todd Edwards; a music video and more!

Hoodwinked is a film for just about anyone who likes humorous movies that are actually funny, except maybe small children who might be frightened or upset by a few scenes that aren't exactly the happiest. This is one film that's got a lot of good jokes and it moves quickly along to be entertaining. Get this and enjoy it!",1246838400,,3111,4.75

2529204,5,B000EQ5UHS,"HOODWINKED is proof that a cartoon does not have to have the best animation or even the best artwork to be truly excellent. Made by a pair of brothers no one has even heard of, Tom and Cory Edwards, and distributed by the Weinstein brothers of Miramax fame, HOODWINKED provides a new and very twisted take on the Little Red Riding Hood fable. The plot as such involves someone stealing pastry recipes and plays out like RASHOMON, in that it ends up being told from various participants' perspectives. While the execution of the cartoon leaves something to be desired -- this is no SHREK or ICE AGE or MONSTERS INC. or even ROBOTS -- the story is absolutely hilarious and the characters (voiced by Andy Dick, Puddy, Glenn Close and Anne Hathaway) are wonderfully fleshed out. Some of the dialog is to die for, and plays equally well to adults and children. Just as importantly, HOODWINKED is a full-blown musical, and the music is as every bit as good as the dialog. The highlight is a number sung by a cursed billy goat (don't ask) as he explains his curse to Red and then takes her on the ride of her life. Many movies are referenced in HOODWINKED, including XXX, THE MATRIX and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, and there is a bizarre extreme sports sequence involving Red's surprisingly athletic grandmother.

After the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek/dp/B00009ZYC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek</a>&nbsp;and many Pixar films, it seemed like everyone was just throwing out any computer-animated movie they could make. None of them could capture the feeling Pixar and Shrek give to us. Oddly enough, Hoodwinked delivered on nearly every single level.

Hoodwinked is the retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. The movie starts off with the scene of Red going home to visit her grandmother only to find that the wolf has disguised himself as her grandmother. Then we see a tied up Grandma fall out of closet and a Woodsman break through the window. Next thing you know the cops show up and cool the situation down. The movie then enters an interrogation type mode in which they question Red, Wolf, Grandma, and the Woodsman. You soon learn that a goody thief is on the loose. The story revolves around trying to figure out who he or she is.

This story is extremely well done and enjoyable to watch. Hearing four different perspectives of what happened is very entertaining and gives a special feel to the story. It's obvious to anyone over ten to realize who the goody thief is by about the third story but that doesn't damper the story any.

The animation isn't the best out there, but it is pretty well done. I'm glad they focused more on the story instead of realism. Still, the animation isn't ugly by any means. You can still see every hair in Wolf. Other characters have good designs that make them different than every other character in this movie.

Extra are your standard deleted scenes, commentary track, and making of features. The deleted scenes are mostly just extended versions of musical parts of the movie. Other deleted scenes are drawn out pictures. This is pretty cool, but doesn't qualify as a great deleted scene to me. The commentary is pretty good and so is the making of.

Don't worry about this movie being too childish for you. My 50-year-old father was even laughing at it while we watched it. It has a very funny story with not too many musical scenes to slow you down. I would recommend that anyone of any age pick up this wonderful movie.",1215907200,2,2229,4.949197860962567

2529212,5,B000EQ5UHS,"Great take on a classic tale and is entertaining for both adults and children. I watched this film with a bunch of kids and they were all more than capable of understanding what was going on and I'd say this movie is far more kid friendly than Shrek so I don't understand the criticism it gets in that regard.

There's no hiding that the CGI quality in this film isn't up to par with other studios out there like Pixar but the story and the way it tells the story is every bit as good. The story is that of Little Red Riding Hood only modified to turn it in to a sort of ""who done it?"" which is told through the eyes of each major player to fit it all together. The mystery portion really isn't that hard to put together, but it is a kids movie and even though you can figure out who the villian is it's still fun to see it all come together.

The voice acting is very well done, especially Anne Hathaway as Red and Patrick Warburton as the Wolf. The movie also contains a good bit of original music, most of which is very well done and some of it is even very catchy.

In the end, while the animation isn't exactly top notch it is still effective and well done and the rest easily makes up for the shortcomings of the animation. It's a great movie for both adults and kids alike and I really don't think kids will have any trouble following along, at most they may simply miss a few jokes aimed at an older audience. It's not Pixar or Dreamworks, and unfortunately it gets a lot of flack from fans of those studios due to that alone, but it's just as good aside from the animation quality which does the job even if it isn't as stellar.",1204416000,,1637,4.1415094339622645

2529228,5,B000EQ5UHS,"Directed by David Cory, ""Hoodwinked,"" is a computer animated film, a humor and mystery reconstruction (""Rashomon Effect"") of the classic fable of Little Red Riding Hood. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) and Detective Bill Stork (Anthony Anderson) investigate a domestic disturbance at Granny's (Glenn Close) cottage, involving a karate-kicking Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway), a sarcastic wolf (Patrick Warburton) and an oafish Woodsman (Jim Belushi). The charges include breaking and entering, intent to eat, wielding an axe without a license; but these unusual suspects have their individual story to tell first. Exaggerated and unrealistic (and unexpected) features such as talking and singing animals are often used in generating humor and laughter.

""Hoodwinked,"" is a delightfully refreshing and funny animated reconstruction on the classic fairy tale ""Little Red Riding Hood."" The story opens with Little Red Riding Hood journeying to visit her Grandmother in the forest. This opening sequence ends with a dramatic confrontation between Red, the Wolf, the Woodsman, and Grandma, just as the police arrive. The rest of the story is a Rashomon-like re-telling of the story from the conflicting points of view of the main characters under police interrogation. The main characters turn out to be far more complex than we were led to believe in childhood. Finally, the truth is revealed and it is quite different and far more sinister than anyone anticipated. The story takes place in the 1970's, illustrated by aspects like bell-bottoms and kung-fu fighting during a cellular-phone free and personal computer free period. The humor is aimed at a general audience of both adults and children, although that opinion depends on who is watching...given the simultaneous presence of child-like characters alongside adult-like mystery and humor.

The police arrive at Granny Pucket's (Glen Close) cottage in the woods to answer a domestic disturbance call. However, Red (Ann Hathaway), Granny, the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), the Woodsman (James Belushi), and Twitchy the squirrel are not your average suspects. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) and Inspector Flippers (David Oden Spears) interrogate them. The suspects emerge as full of their own dark secrets, they are wily and deceptive, their accounts of how they all wound up at grandma's about the crime are conflicting. They each tell their side of the story regarding the mysterious disappearances of special recipes from every bakery and store in town. The police have already decided that Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf, Woodsman and Granny are co-conspirators in the case of the ""Goodie Bandit."" Can hearing four different tales lead to the real Goodie Bandit? The ""Goodie Bandit,"" ought to be uncovered, even if it could turn out to be the cute and cuddly local rabbit Boingo (Andy Dick). The detectives learn, as they interview the participants and get each one's perspective, that Granny is not so helpless, Red may have been doing more than just visiting relatives, the Wolf isn't the predator he has been cranked up to be, and the Woodman is not that much more intelligent than the trees he chops down. Twitchy is the caffeine-addicted, hyperactive and fast talking but lovable squirrel, and she steals the show. Red is bold and clever, but still maintains a girlish innocence. Granny is tough as nails far-fetched from the usual symbol of elderly weakness. The mad mountain goat Japeth has various horn attachments for all his needs, including one for opening bottles. The catchy little tune he sings sticks in the mind, for quite a long time. Japeth is unforgettable, he takes a ride with Little Red through a mine. Japeth is blind and he yodels! This is alongside many other pretty funny situations and one-liners in the movie. One is bound to roar with laughter during the scenes with Japeth the Goat. Japeth is under a curse to always sing, and he quite often uses his horns to swing things around. Indeed, the funniest part movie is this Red's encounter with Japeth the Goat. The best lines in the movie are the cursed goat's verse, ""There is an avalanche a-coming, and I do not feel prepared!"" and ""Since I have to sing everything, I' will just yodel till we are creamed!"" Rather than being a regular variation on an old children's classic tale of Red Riding Hood, in the film you get the tale through the eyes of many of the participants before, at the end, you fully decipher what is really going on. Granny turns out to be a famous 'goodie' maker and Red is her delivery-girl. As the stories unwind everything makes sense all connecting in very clever and sometimes hysterical ways. Quite clever and humorous! ""Hoodwinked"" doesn't really try to push any particular message or theme, but it does crank up the humor meter to the top.

Red, tired of the same routine, wants to get out of the forest. But she is aware of who she is and how important it is to keep her job, especially given that her Grandma held it prior to her. Red does not easily give in to anyone though, and will put up a fight if provoked. Her Grandma, while keeping her usual job of selling baked goods, is also sick of her same routine, and does not want to the role of the average grandma. She delves into skydiving, snow boarding, and several other heavy-action activities. The Wolf is a pretty interesting character- voiced by the guy who plays the handicapped cop on Family Guy, usually talking in a calm voice regardless of the situation. He's teamed up with a demented squirrel who should never be given coffee to balance out his coolness. The Woodsman is so big and dumb, yet quite lovable. His song about schnitzels is one to remember, as is everything he does. In addition to such memorable characters, little humorous things are endless. Characters like the mountain goat have been mentioned. Another memorable scene is where the squirrel talks so fast that he can hardly be understood! The police turn to using  voice recorder to record him, then slow down the tape to intelligible speed. It turns out that the squirrel's voice is very clear, deep and calm, and it is humorous. The squirrel is intrigued with his voice and tone on the slowed-down taping.

The movie is a reminder to leave one's stereotypes behind and listen to the facts and issues before judging and making conclusions. Hence it is not the Big Bad Wolf that is always the guilty one; rather, the cute innocent bunny can turn out to be the bad boy. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) was immediately suspicious of the Wolf, but Nicky Flippers was wise enough to interview all the suspects. Evidently it is not as it seems. The Wolf is actually an investigative reporter looking into the Goody Bandit case. The woodsman is a schnitzel truck driver who dreams of being an actor. Granny is an extreme sports enthusiast. And just what does Boingo (Andy Dick), a cute bunny seemingly everywhere, have to do with it all? Well, it's a tricky case but if someone could break it, it's Nicky Flippers. Actually, to many it was  pretty obvious who the culprit was but that does not rid us of the laughter the film generates.",1192320000,,7110,4.920833333333333
2529229,5,B000EQ5UHS,This is one of the most funniest animated movies I have seen. The squirrel done by Anthony Anderson was fantastic.

2529230,4,B000EQ5UHS,"""Hoodwinked,"" the story of famous Red Riding Hood retold in ""Rashomon"" style, may not impress you as the greatest animation, but it is definitely more entertaining than the works from bigger studios like ""Chicken Little."" Also, you may find some part of the film is similar to other animated films - how many times have we seen a fast-talking squirrel running around, for example - but other funnier characters and clever script will make up for that unoriginality.

The film opens with the famous scene of the famous tale, where Red Riding Hood encounters a big bad wolf in her Grandma's house. But another character wielding an ace breaks into the room, which leads to the police investigation led by a frog inspector who is dressed and talks like characters from the 1930s crime suspense. The wacky humor and numerous pop culture references (including such hits from ""XXX"" to ""Kill Bill"") may not appeal to some viewers, but I enjoyed watching most part of them for what they are, the singing goat in particular. Interesting thing about the film is that it does not contain any gross-out gags. The humor of this fast-paced film is closer to that of Looney Toons.

[CHARACTER DESIGNS] The animation characters of ""Hoodwinked"" may not be the ""prettiest"" ones that I have seen in recent years. They need more polishing up (and budget), especially when showing the human characters on screen. The facial expressions of Red and Grandma need to be more colorful, but I think this has something to do with the basic designs of them, not exactly the budget as some reviewers say. All they (filmmakers) need is experience, which I hope will be shown in their next feature.",1191715200,,1666,4.821678321678322

It's part film noir, part fantasy, part comedy, part Indiana Jones adventure, part Thin Man detective, on and on. One thing for sure: although kids might like it, this movie is geared more for adults. Even older adults as some of the humor is referenced by classic movies.

I doubt if this was a hit movie probably because of the above. Animated films need to be geared toward young kids who want to see it, and then get their parents to take them to the theater. I'm not complaining, just explaining why some of you may not have heard of this film. I heard about it by accident.

More than the geared-toward adults-dialog, what fascinated me were the visuals. This is beautifully drawn with magnificent colors that are not bold and bright, Although most animated films of today feature bright and bold colors, which look fantastic, this looked good, too, because of the richness of the colors. It's hard to describe; you have to see it. It just looks different, but very pleasing to my eyes.

Hoodwinked is one of my favorites, because the humor it uses is clean and non-stop.

The story is great, and while one may be tempted to compare Hoodwinked to Pixar's films and Shrek, it really is on a class of its own.  Sure, the animation isn't jaw-dropping... but the story is light and is there to make you smile.

Each tell a variation of what really happened - ergo, the Little Red Riding Hood story. As the detectives interview the participants and get each individual's perspective, they learn that Granny isn't so helpless, Red may have been doing more than just visiting relatives, the Wolf isn't the predator he's been cracked up to be, and the Woodman doesn't have much of an intellectual advantage over the trees he chops down.

My word, another ""Shrek"" clone? From the Weinstein brothers? ""Hoodwinked"" had some potential to be great. On one hand, you had an amazing A-list cast you're working with. Then, you have a ""Pulp Fiction""-style plot movement where the stories of the main characters intertwine. But director Cory Edwards (who also doubles as the voice of the squirrel, who gets the movie's major laughs) is too eager to please, and ""Hoodwinked"" becomes another attempt to outdo ""Shrek"". And like all directors, Edwards falls flat.

The visuals of ""Hoodwinked"" are surprisingly well-conceived. While it ain't up to the standards ""Shrek"" or ""Finding Nemo"" set, some of the designs are rather sharp. The Wolf has a lot of detail paid attention to its fur, while Red's cape swishes along with the wind.

But the movie gets bogged down by a sensory overload of pop culture references. It's not like ""Shark Tale,"" mind you, but the opportunity to crack open some good laugh-getting moments isn't taken. Why does the screenplay, also written by Cory Edwards, have to require tired references to ""Star Wars"" (""Use the hood"", Granny tells Red when she's soaring in the air) and ""The Matrix"" (more slow-mo scenes) that earlier movies have already used and succeeded. And then there's a musical score which sounds like something out of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" which isn't as clever as it is on paper. The only clever moment comes when we run into a spoof of ""xXx,"" where we see Granny compete in a snowboard race and, at the end, blows it up to create an avalanche. Not good stuff, mind you, but better than what else the movie has to offer.

This movie also rips off of ""Ella Enchanted,"" another movie star Anne Hathaway done. Yes, our heroine Red knows karate. While Mrs. Hathaway does a good job providing spunk for Red, her character isn't developed enough for us to care when the movie gets serious.

Speaking of that, when the movie reaches its finale climax, it's where ""Hoodwinked"" takes a major hit (and Andy Dick, who voices the bunny in the stories, is at his unfunniest). The beginning of the movie, while not producing much laughs, has some utter confidence and making this movie a breezy time. But once it reaches the end, it becomes a full-scale action/adventure where wit is thrown out the window, and the movie begins to drag (spoiler: it's a lame parody of the finale from ""Batman Begins"", or so I think... whatever!)

Back to the performances. Glenn Close, fresh from the heyday that was season four of ""The Shield"", does a good job voicing a grandmother with a secret. Warburton is usually reliable in various situations, especially when he shares the scenes with Twitchy the squirrel. Jim Belushi sadly phones in his performance and comes off as a bad imitation of Shrek, but with a German accent. The rest of the cast includes David Ogden Stiers (who, in case you don't know, voiced Jumba in ""Lilo & Stitch"") as Nicky Flippers, and a brief appearance by Chazz Palmintieri as a sheep informant.

This is a movie that is saved by spirited performances from Hathaway and Close. But with forced sentiments in the middle, a drawn-out finale, and humorless pop culture references here and there, there is nothing here but ""Shrek"" leftovers.",1164412800,2,3874,4.896341463414634

The film is simple enough, but does a great job of providing high quality entertainment the likes of which we don't get to see often enough.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Hoodwinked is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with Shrek and Shrek 2.",1163203200,4,1099,5.038674033149171

2529276,5,B000EQ5UHS,"When I originally saw Shrek on the big screen, I was awed at how intentionally hilarious it was with its' turned-on-its'-ear Disney schlock parodious delivery. I marvelled at the creativity and sheer brilliance of the simple storyline littered with storybook off takes and dark comedy anecdotes clearly aimed at the adult's funnybones. Fast forward to a few days ago. I was treated to an amazing movie that I'd heard very little about originally. Hoodwinked, a retelling of the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood told from each character's point of view seemed all but forgotten in a rash of other higher profile animation releases such as cars, over the hedge, chicken little and many other computer animated films that just didn't really hit the mark all that well. Hoodwinked is a visual treat for anyone familiar with Rankin Bass type animated characters and the writing is tour de force with hundreds of little in jokes for those in the audience older than Red Riding Hood's original age target. Make no mistake, This movie is literally like Shrek on steroids with so many layers jammed into its' hour and a half running time that the creators could literally have made 3 movies out of it. There is never any off putting potty humor or dumbed down innuendo jokes so frequently found in this type of movie, its all over the top clever and if you blink, you'll miss some important funny anecdote. This movie is literally a crowd pleaser of the best kind. Kids will love the fast pace, adults will love the portrayals, creativity and non stop nudge the ribs of the person sitting next to you ""in"" jokes. Just be prepared to laugh yourself silly.

The basic story is that the truth is out there, and by hearing all the stories, you get a mosaic which shows the truth.  It was quite interesting watching them do it, but for some adults, the answer might seem a little obvious.  The allusions still make for a fun movie though.

Some of the allusions are spoofing the cinematography of different filmmakers.  Others are allusions to specific films.  For instance, if you are a Chevy Chase fan (he isn't in the movie), then you would recognize the Fletch references through one storyline.  Because of references like these, I don't think kids will get everything out of the movie that adults would.

I would recommend this movie for a quick watch.  It is not meant to be taken seriously (there is too much singing for that), but it is good for a chuckle or two.",1156550400,2,1061,4.526315789473684

2529291,4,B000EQ5UHS,"""Hoodwinked"" is quite a funny movie. Parts reminded me of the old Bob Clampett/Tex Avery cartoons, others reminded me of the works of John Kricfalusi (Ren & Stimpy). Unlike the more ""accessible"" Pixar/Dreamworks efforts of recent years, ""Hoodwinked"" doesn't really try to push any particular message or theme, it just cranks the wackiness meter up to eleven, with crazy characters (including a beefy Ah-nuld soundalike, and an unforgettable singing mountain goat who you won't be able to get out of your head afterwards) and insane situations. It's told in a pseudo-Pulp Fiction/Rashomon ""answers first, questions later"" style which is quite interesting. You'll probably guess the identity of the villain long before the end, but that won't make it any less enjoyable. This film isn't really aimed at kids, more at ""kidults"", adults who have retained a childlike sense of fun and whimsy. Yes, the animation isn't as slick as what you'd normally see in a $100 million studio features, but world-class animation does not a good film make (""Shark Tale"", anyone?). After five minutes, you won't even notice that the film looks like it was created on a Mac home computer, you'll be just swept away by the sheer looniness of it all. Keep an eye on newcomer director Cory Edwards - he's got a bright future.",1155168000,4,1300,4.9953917050691246
2529292,3,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked is the ""Rashomon"" of computer animated movies, where the Little Red Riding Hood story is told from different characters' perspectives.

The outstanding voice talent in the movie is Andy Dick, who voices the villain; Patrick Warburton (""Putty"" from Seinfeld) also has an interesting voice and gives a new spin on The Wolf.  My favorite character was the blind, yodeling mountain goat.  Absolutely hilarious.  There are also some pretty funny situations and one-liners in the movie.

Hoodwinked is filled with movie references along the lines of other recent computer animated movies such as Shrek.  Keen-eyed adults (and some kids too) watching the movie will catch references to The Thin Man, Mission Impossible, and Dick Tracy, and other movies.

Most of the time these references are funny inside jokes, but in some instances, it just feels like the makers of Hoodwinked are ripping off other movies.  For instance, there is a hyper-active squirrel named Twitchy in Hoodwinked that is strikingly similar to that fidgety Scrat from Ice Age.  Twitchy isn't just a quick reference, he's an ongoing character in the movie.  Couldn't the makers of Hoodwinked have come up with more original characteristics?

The biggest disappointment in the movie, however, is the animation itself.  The human characters in the movie are particularly embarrassing.  I'm not sure if they were going for the ""crude/unfinished animation"" style, but it isn't good.  Many high school students could achieve better results.  The human characters' mouths basically open and close when they're talking; the animators barely even try to articulate the words with lip movement.

With some great animated movies out there like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, watching animation like this is disappointing, no matter how funny or entertaining the story is.

If you are a parent and can find Hoodwinked on sale, you might want to pick it up so your kids can watch it multiple times.  They will likely enjoy seeing how the different versions of the Red Riding Hood story compare/contrast/intersect with multiple viewings.  However, if you are an adult and watching movies for yourself, you might want to find a movie with finer animation.",1155081600,2,2219,5.235127478753541
2529293,3,B000EQ5UHS,I enjoyed this somewhat. Some of the gags were funny like a Warner Bros cartoon. But the storyline got old [...].,1154995200,,113,4.428571428571429
2529294,4,B000EQ5UHS,"First things first: The first ten minutes of this movie is atrocious!  My wife and I kept exchanging glances at each other as if to say, ""What are we watching here?  This is garbage!""  But then a funny thing happened...it got really good.  So here is my advice to someone watching the movie.  Give it a chance and don't turn it off after ten minutes!

Of course, the first ten minutes are necessary to the plot of the movie, but it seems very jumbled and is filled with so many fairy tale characters that you begin the movie very overwhelmed.  Plus, the animation is very medicore (let's face it, it's not PIXAR!), and it makes you wonder what could this movie possible offer.  But you begin to like the feel of the animation as it brings back memories of the animation of the original fairytales, with characters with large eyes and cutesy woodland creatures.

The voicework in this movie, though, is outstanding with Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries) as Red and Patrick Warburton (David Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Wolf, among others.  And besides the uneasy, unintentional laughter that takes place in the first ten minutes, the rest of the movie is filled with a lot of laughter and a good mystery (for kids).  I, however, guessed who was the bandit about 20 minutes into the movie, but I don't think a kid would be able to guess it.  And this movie is more for kids (whereas a lot of cartoons these days are both for kids AND adults, with a lot of adult humor), but adults should still enjoy many different facets of the movie.  Going back to the laughter, I was roaring with laughter during the scenes with Japeth the Goat, who was under a curse to always sing and was constantly using his horns to swing around things.  Other parts of the movie are very funny as well so be ready to laugh.

All in all, I would say that this a four star movie, as I have said the first ten minutes are odd and it does not compare to movies such as FInding Nemo or Toy Story.  But I do think this is a wonderful family movie that a kid would want to watch again and again.",1154390400,3,2060,4.36745406824147

Hoodwinked is a computer animated movie that takes a sort of postmodern look at the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood.  The movie opens with Red (as in Little Riding Hood) making the fabled entrance into Grandma's house, encountering the wolf, with bound-and-gagged grandma and the ax-wielding woodsman arriving on the scene--then the cops show up.  Amphibian investigator Nicky Flippers takes over the case, interviewing all the key players one by one and having them each give, Rashomon-like, their version of the story.  The pleasure, as these tales unfold, is in seeing how elements of one character's explanation fits into or explains or even causes things seen in another character's version.  This plus the by now expected Shrek-style postmodern/referential humor makes the movie a fun one for adults, but I imagine older kids would enjoy the story too, seeing how it all fits together in the end, and fits into a larger plot involving an evil mastermind out to steal all the goodie recipes in the forest.

The only rather limp subplot for me was Red's desire to see more of the world and not be protected from risk by her doting grandmother (who has secrets of her own).  That, and the songs, I could have done without.  The rest was sheer pleasure, and frequently laugh-out-loud fun.  This movie should have gotten more attention as a theatrical release, and I hope it finds an audience on DVD.",1152576000,4,1622,4.764285714285714
2529298,4,B000EQ5UHS,"I didn't finish watching this movie with some great and profound new theory on life. In fact, the theme was about as generic as they come, being something along the lines of learning to accept one's family and find one's inner strengths. However, I did finish this movie with a few silly jokes bouncing around in my head, and a half-sheepish smile on my face.

Why half-sheepish? Well, at sixteen-years-old, I'm hardly supposed to enjoy fairy tales. This one, however, had a certain charm, which, incidentally, was based solely in the show's spunky characters. Red is bold and clever, and yet maintains a girlish innocence. Granny is tough as nails, hardly the usual symbol of elderly weakness. The wolf is that sort of pathetic embodiment of middle-agedness that heads so many bad sit-coms. Other characters, though small, flesh out wonderfully in well-orchestrated moments.

The movie, however, wasn't flawless. I was irrated by the constant use of bad German accents for humour, and I can hardly say that the film changed my life. However, it was a welcome diversion, and it filled my evening with that fleeting sense of happiness and comfort that only children's movies can create. It wasn't an hour and fifteen minutes shamelessly wasted by the filmmaker, but, rather, an hour and fifteen minutes intentionally thrown away by me.",1152489600,2,1334,5.031674208144796

2529303,5,B000EQ5UHS,"""Hoodwinked"" takes the classic story of Little Red Riding Hood and basically turns it into a version of Law & Order. The movie didn't get good reviews, but it's actually pretty damn funny and entertaining. The animation is pretty good too, these animated characters look better than Scooby-Doo and Garfield look. In the beginning, we're introduced to Red (Anne Hathaway, 'Brokeback Mountain') who is heading to her Granny's (Glenn Close, 'Fatal Attraction') house to drop off some food. When she gets there she encounters The Wolf (Patrick Warburton, TV's 'Family Guy') dressed in a suit to look like her Granny. Soon after, The Woodsman (Jim Belushi, TV's 'According to Jim') burst in wielding an axe. Minutes later, the police arrive to begin interrogation. At first we meet a couple cops, Detective Stork (Anthony Anderson, 'Kangaroo Jack') and Chief Grizzly (Xzibit, TV's 'Pimp My Ride'), but the investigation is soon led by Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Steirs). In case I hadn't made it clear, both humans and animals interact in this world. Anyway, as interrogation begins they're given four different tales of how everyone wound up at Granny's house and it's all very interesting. It's a completely different spin on Little Red Riding Hood and it's the best version I've ever seen of it. All the voice work is great; Even the usually annoying Andy Dick lends his voice to Boingo, a cute little bunny. But Anne Hathaway is perfect as red; Both Jim Belushi & Glenn Close sound unrecognizable. Patrick Warburton is perfect giving voiceovers, he has a great voice. Xzibit, Anthony Anderson, and David Ogden Steirs are perfect as cops...And to top all this off, this movie can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. There's few innuendos, but a lot of references adults will notice (a few of the cops are pigs, etc.) Anyway, despite various reports, this is a charming and semi-funny but very enjoyable movie. If you liked Shrek or other movies like that then definitely check this out.

Someone has been stealing the entire forest's recipes, and a domestic disturbance involving Red, the Wolf, Granny, and the Woodsman bring police one step closer to the Goody Bandit. But Red and company aren't your usual suspects. One by one, Detective Nicky Flippers interviews each character for their interpretation of the events that lead up to this point.

Within the first 20 minutes, anyone over 10 should figure out the Bandit, but it's still a very enjoyable and witty film.

While the movie was not highly regarded by the critics, in my opinion this movie really succeeded at what it set out to do, entertain children and the parents that brought them in a unique way.

The two things about the movie that made it memorable are 1, the story, 2, the soundtrack.

The story is a simple time honored one, Little Red Ridinghood, but that's where the familiar part ends.  The movie tells the story from everyone's point of view, Reds, Granny's, the Wolf, etc..  As I watched the movie it was cool to see how it one story crossed over to another, kids will like, but the adults watching will appreciate it.

Little Red Riding Hood (voiced by Anne Hathaway) is the concerned goodies delivery girl who goes to deliver the book of recipes for safekeeping to her expert cookie-maker grandma, Granny Puckett (Glenn Close). En route, she is hassled by the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), who later on masquerades as Red's grandma in her house. There follows a confrontation involving Red, the Wolf, Granny and a raging, axe-wielding woodsman (Jim Belushi), who had burst into the house moments before. Cut much later to a busy police-cordoned scene in front of Granny's house, where a domestic disturbance is being investigated. Chief Grizzly (Xzibit) is immediately suspicious of the Wolf, but Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) conducts interviews of all parties involved. Each of the suspect then has his/her overlapping flashback version and it's soon pretty apparent that all is not as it seems. The Wolf is actually an investigative reporter looking into the Goody Bandit case. The woodsman is a schnitzel truck driver who dreams of being an actor. Granny is an extreme sports enthusiast. And just what does Boingo (Andy Dick), a cute bunny seemingly everywhere, have to do with it all? Well, it's a tricky case but if someone could break it, it's Nicky Flippers. Actually, it's pretty obvious who the culprit is but hey, the movie's still tons of fun.

Hoodwinked is a pretty cool but bent animated film that modernizes and puts new twists and turns into the classic Little Red Riding Hood tale. It's as if E! True Hollywood Story had covered it. This movie channels Rashomon, Who Killed Roger Rabbit? and various police procedural movies, but with the pertinent roles being played by fairy tale characters. Nicky Flippers is obviously patterned after my favorite shamus Nick Charles: Flippers has on a William Powell-like mustache and his intro scene even has him walking in with a miniature terrier. Friends of mine have commented that the graphics are awkward and unpolished but I personally find it appealingly crude, lending a certain old school charm to the endeavor. The songs are also pretty nice, especially the Boingo song and the Schnitzel song.

2529309,2,B000EQ5UHS,"I had some fun watching ""Hoodwinked"", but not as much fun as I'd expected. Here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)

The open-ended one sentence summary: Goodie recipes have been disappearing from the forest lately, and now the police is investigating a domestic disturbance involving a wolf, a girl, a grandma, and an ax-wielding woodcutter, for possible connections. Hoo boy.

Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Nothing that I specifically remember. A little mild violence maybe.

Characters: 3 of 5 stars. While the animation was weak, you can't take it out on the characters. The casting was good, lots of big names in there, particually with Patrick Warburton as the Wolf. Twitchy the squirrel was probably the crowd favorite though, and had us kids in stitches. Japeth the Ram was popular too.

Plot: 2 of 5 stars. Mostly just the same story told from different points of view, the classic whodunnit plot. They all kind of overlap, so it's difficult to follow at times, but the funny stuff seemed to be entertaining whoever didn't know what was going on. There was slapstick humor for the kids, and dialogue quips for the older crowd.

Animation: 2 of 5 stars. The animation has not much going for it at all. I found some the character designs weak and distracting.

Music: 2 of 5 stars. The original songs alternate from being funny to being really lame to being only semi-lame. Not much to like here, except maybe Japeth's song and Red is Blue.

Impact: 3 of 5 stars. This movie tried to have some emotional impact, and it failed. That's probably because I didn't take the characters that seriously. I did find it to be really funny in parts, and I even laughed hysterically several times. There were some fun quotable lines and a satisfying ending, but it wasn't really my cup of tea... er coffee. I'll only remember this movie as a time I had fun one Tuesday morning.

All in all, 2.5 of 5 stars.",1151712000,2,1907,4.72289156626506
2529310,3,B000EQ5UHS,"With its clever script and a host of fairy tale characters gone haywire, ""Hoodwinked"" explores, via police interrogation, the untold story of Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.  The film opens at the end of the known fairy tale when Red notices the big eyes, ears, and teeth of Granny, and discovers that it's really the Wolf.  An axe-wielding woodman breaks into the house, and rescues both Red and the tied-up Granny.  But is that the whole story?  As the viewer quickly learns, the answer is ""No.""

Fairy tale land has been plagued by a recipe thief, who has put all the sweets bakers of the fairy tale world out of business - except for Granny.  Does Red or Granny have anything to do with this?  Why is the Big Bad Wolf dressed in Granny's clothes?  And could the Woodsman really be capable of rescuing Red?  Who is the hyper-active, speed talking squirrel, and why does the bunny keep cropping up in everyone's story?  What secrets do Red and her Granny hide?

While individual parts of this movie are funny, it doesn't stick together well as a whole.  The computer animation is clunky, and the story itself, once the premise is revealed, is not particularly compelling.  Still, it has its moments:  a goat who ""talks"" in song, the taped voice of the squirrel re-played at a much slower speed, the crazed but sweet incompetence of the Woodsman, and the explanation of Red's vision of her grandmother.  Some of the twists are laugh out-loud funny, but most evoke merely a smile or two.

This movie is good for a rental to enjoy with the kids, although they won't get most of the jokes.  Instead, they will probably enjoy the fast-paced, visually active parade of characters.

Certainly the quality of animation between the two movies is vastly different, but I enjoyed both on each one's merits.  ""Hoodwinked"" was fun, with a modern take on the classic fairy tale.  My favorite characters are Wolf and Twitchy, but the Schnitzel Song scene is very neat as a Rankin-Bass parody, and I watched the Red is Blue scene a few times just to hear the song some more.  (The one gripe I had was the unfinished look of the animation for the ""Critters Have Feelings"" video; that was distracting.)  I was shocked when I did an Internet search later and saw so many poor reviews of the movie.  Could it be that most of the reviewers are too old to have played video games, and so to them anything less polished than Pixar or Disney's standard just doesn't cut it?  It's a mystery to me.

Times called ""high-energy, imaginative entertainment."" With irreverent storytelling, spunk and wit, Hoodwinked delivers a comedy caper for the young, the young at heart and everyone in between. When the police arrive at Granny's cottage in the woods to answer a domestic disturbance call, it looks like just another open-and-shut case. But Red, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and the Woodsman are not your usual suspects, as they have their own dark secrets, wily deceptions and conflicting accounts of the crime. Together, they must put aside their differences and find their own original twist on Happily Ever After in this ""raucous, genre-busting, animated gem (Entertainment Weekly, The Must List).""",1151366400,,868,5.119718309859155
2529347,3,B000EQ5UHS,"-- but ends up compromised. The story has a familiar storybook start (including a clever animation of a pop-up storybook): Red, Grandma, Wolf, Woodsman - you know. Then the police show up, and anyone who remembers 1970s jargon will recognize the ""smokies"" and the ""pigs."" It's a whole new story from that point on, with a Poirot-like frog (get it? the French detective is a ""frog""?) trying to work out just what happened and why.

Each character is interrogated in turn, and the story is retold from that character's standpoint. Wolf, it turns out, was an investigative reporter under cover. Woodsman was -- well, you'll see. Granny, the last to give her deposition, is worth waiting for. And I'm not going to say who did it.

Despite the promising material, Hoodwinked never matches the sparkle that Shrek achieved so casually. The humor is broader and less daring, and the characters are shallower. Many references to current media and events make it sound fresh but also ensure that it will go stale fast, so see it soon if you see it at all.

This one is OK as a kid's movie, but doesn't have quite enough in it to entertain the adult who paid for it. In the end, 'Hoodwinked' is how you might feel if you shelled out full price for the movie ticket or video.

The story of Hoodwinked is offbeat, and not a generic style that has been done a hundred times in the past 10 years. The setting is the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and the story is told in the format of a crime screne investigation. The story is retold through the eyes of the four main characters, Little Red Riding Hood, Grandmother, the Big Bad Wolf, and Paul Bunyon. Some twists are thrown in for fun: grandma loves extreme sports and fighting, the wolf is an undercover reporter, and Paul Bunyon is an actor pitching cream for your Bunyons.

If you are looking for a good children's movie, you can't go wrong with Hookwinked. Even though it sounds like a movie for younger kids, it has many things that appeal to older kids as well. (extreme sports, etc.) I can'ty tell you the number of times we laughed out loud.

I'll admit, the previews were a turnoff. But I said, hey! 'If the graphics are so bad, the movie has to have a catch to it."" And it did. It was hilarious. I haven't laughed at such clever jokes in a long time. The voice acting was terrific. The Wolf had a great dead-pan voice that totally suited him, Anne Hathaway and Glenn Close did good jobs as Red and Granny. I love EVERY character. Each were delightful, even the squirrel who, surprisingly, didn't annoy me. Trust me, kids AND adults will love this show. My neighbour's kid had such a great time when he ""figured out"" that the criminal was the Bunny. I mean, people our age would know it instantly, but let the kids work it out themselves. It's a great morale boost for sure. In the end, Hoodwinked is a great example that a movie doesn't have to be flashy to be wonderful. It's like an indie flick.

But it is an interesting study -- at least for me -- in why some movies work and some don't.

I made it about half way through this movie before turning it off, and here are some observations on why it didn't work for me.  (And, I loved both Shrek movies and Ice Age.)

1.  It seemed that all the characters were arrogant jerks.  That is, until the goat.  I loved the goat, and the number about being prepared was funny, especially with all the sight gags using his horns.  Other than that, the main characters all seemed rude and vulgar, like they'd be spewing obscenities if they were just being themselves and not living in a movie aimed at the family audience.

2.  Since they were mostly all jerks, there was very little contrast between the characters and thus little chemestry between them either.

3.  The pacing was frantic and random.  It seemed like there were no scenes that lasted more than a few seconds.  Just one forced verbal gag or sight gag after another.

Anyway, if you really want to see this film I'd suggest renting it once it's no longer a new release and you can keep it for three days for a couple of bucks.  Then decide if it's one to add to your permanent movie collection.",1150156800,4,1253,4.359307359307359
2529369,4,B000EQ5UHS,"Hoodwinked:  The True Story of Little Red Riding Hood, is a new computer animated film from a new entry to the field, Blue Yonder Films.  To date this field has been dominated by pioneering Pixar (Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles), close 2nd Dreamworks (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar), with 20th Century Animation (Robots and Ice Age) as third entrant.  From a computer animation standpoint no one yet beats Pixar, although 20th Century Animation is a close second.  Blue Yonder really has a ways to go before they even come close to Pixar's pioneering Toy Story.  The animation in Hoodwinked is not all that good compared to Pixar, 20th Century or even Dreamworks.

However, no amount of animation can make up for a horrible story and unappealling characters (Chicken Little, Shark Tale and Robots, for example), and a great story and characters can make up for 2nd rate animation (Shrek).  Hoodwinked benefits from having a great story and a couple of really funny characters.  The story is of Little Red Riding Hood, but in this world, little Red Riding Hood finds the wolf disguised as her granny, her granny tied up in the closet and as the woodsman crashes through the window ax in hand, the police show up at granny's cottage on a domestic violence call.

Each of the four characters has a different story to relate and are interviewed one at a time by the chief detective.  The stories interlock, for example, the track outage in Red Riding Hood's mine adventure is caused earlier by the Wolf and his sidekick, Twitchy the squirrel, in an hilarious sequence.  (""What kind of candles are those?""  ""Deen-o-mite-tay, sounds like an Italian brand"").

Suffice it to say that once the stories have been told, the villain of the piece is discovered and a hair raising adventure ends the film.

The characters and the lines are what make the movie though.  It's very much like the Shrek films in that some of the lines children will not understand completely, but the lines aren't quite as adult as some of the ones in the Shrek films.  The biggest failing of the movie is that the animation really should have been better.  Either Pixar or Dreamworks would have done a much better job with the animation.

All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie laughing out loud several times as I watched it.  The wolf is hilarious, the detective is really good and Twitchy the squirell is a riot.  I'd give it 5 stars if the animation was a little bit better.  But as far as stories go, this is right up there with the Shrek films, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles as the best of the computer animated genre.",1150070400,4,2616,4.705494505494506

2529372,4,B000EQ5UHS,"What if Grandma's house became a crime scene?  And Grandma, Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf and the Lumberjack were all taken into custody and questioned?  That's exactly the premise of HOODWINKED, a new movie from a new animation studio on the block that's kicking furry tail and taking names.  Conducted like a police investigation into the mysterious burglaries that are putting Goodie businesses out of operation, HOODWINKED sails through a storyline that is filled with great humor and pratfalls.  All four suspects are questioned by Nicky Flippers, the frog who conducts the interviews, and all of them have surprising secrets to reveal.  And the bad guy is still out there waiting in the wings.

Kanbar Entertainment was born when the talented people who brought this movie into the world gathered.  Cory and Todd Edwards (DOOGLE) wrote and directed, Tony Leech (DOOGLE) wrote.  Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Anne Hathaway, Patrick Warburton, Andy Dick, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri and Anthony Anderson did the voices.

The best part of HOODWINKED is the way the initial four stories overlap.  The funniest bit in the movie, which the extra features reveal was almost pulled from the end product, is Red's encounter with Japeth the Goat.  The best lines in the movie are the cursed goat's verse, ""There's an avalanche a-coming, and I do not feel prepared!"" and ""Since I have to sing everything, I'll just yodel till we're creamed!""  The story fits together like a Chinese puzzle, with everything hidden within everything else.  The visual aspect, though some may gripe about it not being as smooth as Pixar, absolutely fits the story.

The end of the movie didn't quite live up to the buildup.  Unfortunately, that may not have been possible.  The building with the four interwoven stories is just absolute dynamite.

HOODWINKED is fun fare for the whole family.  Having kids gives adults a good excuse to watch the movie, but they aren't necessary.  The movie is just great entertainment.",1149811200,,2010,5.054711246200608

It was about a little town who's store and bakeries were all going out of buisness because someone is stealing all the recipes. So the last place that has the recipe still is the grandmother of Little Red Riding Hood. So a event happens between alot of fairy tale creatures that has the robber in it. So one by one, they each tell there story to see who is telling the truth and who is lying.

Now it you liked shrek, you are going to like this movie. Because it has the same like ability factor as shrek had. So if your in the mood for something really funny. Check this one out.",1149465600,3,750,4.0608108108108105

Don't let that comparison scare you into thinking this is not a family friendly film though, I would also say this is the best film for kids I have seen in a long time.  Zero sexual innuendo, and no stupid fart jokes or other potty humor that permeate so many other movies aimed at kids.

You may be put off by the graphics a bit if you are used to Pixar movies, as they are not as detailed in this movie.  But this movie proves that a great plot and clever writing overcomes the lack of things like 5 billion individually animated hairs on the wolf.

What's great about this movie is that, although I guessed the bad guy about half way through it still keeped me guessing how things were to tie into one another.  It starts off a little slow, not so funny but then up comes the cute little bunny rabbit (Andy Dick) and it starts to quickly climb uphill...add in a singing goat with detatchable horns and a hyper active squirrel and you have some really funny scenes.  So heres the deal, a domestic disterbance call is made and we find Granny tied up, the Wolf wearing a granny mask and apron and a woodsman screaming with an ax...and theres Red just, ummm, standing there.  The police cheif and detective sit each one down and get there side of the story.  You see, this incident they believe ties in with the Goodie Bandit, someone whos been stealing the recipes of the neighborhood and putting all the 'goodie' makers out of business.  You see Granny is a famous 'goodie' maker and Red is her delivery-girl.  As the stories unwind everything makes sense and they all connect in very clever and sometimes histerical ways.  This may not be as funny as 'Madagascar' or 'Ice Age' but it's as clever as 'Shrek' and that adds some major points making this a fun family film that everyone can enjoy.  Andy Dick is hilarious and makes this film as funny as it is.  Good choice of charactor selection, and excelent script so kudo's to the writting team here.

And in this school he started, he looked at how people interacted with each other.  He thought that there were other, new, and interesting ways to look at those interactions, so he analyzed them--hence the name.

One of the things he looked at was fairy tales, and the one he analyzed most was Little Red Riding Hood.  It was part of a book he wrote called ""What Do You Say After You Say Hello?""  It would seem that the scriptwriters of Hoodwinked probably read WDYSAYSH,  because they got the characters right down to the Queen's own taste: the not-so-helpless little girl in a red cape, the granny looking for action at any price, the mother whose motives are always suspect, the schlemiel wolf, and the hunter/rescuer with the adolesscent script.

2529401,4,B000EQ5UHS,"As little red riding hood walks into grandma's house, the wolf looks through the granny mask and the famous lines, ""What big... you have!"" comments ensue, and then suddenly chaos errupts as the wolf leaps out of the bed, granny leaps out of no where, and a woodsman breaks in on the fray wielding an axe, before the cops of the forest arrive, and get to the bottom of the little red riding hood story.

With the exception of some jokes [that are clearly targeted towards the younger generation, and some jokes are just... lame to be lame] this movie should keep you entertained with a wide variety of humor. From watching Granny surf a twenty foot wave, to seeing just what it is the wolf and his faithful side kick do for a living. The plot line does keep to what actually happened on that day when little red riding hood's legend began, but on the back side, there is a recipe snatcher on the loose, and no recipe is safe from its cluches! Augh! the humanity of it all... Will the forst band together and finally knab that recipe snatcher? Or will it continue its rampage until there are no secret recipes left!?

This movie had me laughing out loud in more than a few parts, and gave me a faint pain in my side in scenes with the singing goat [you'll find out]. All in all, a great fun filled family movie. The best since Any disney cartoon production in the past 5 years in my opinion. Don't be fooled by the independent lable, this is a very well done movie. It deserves a place on the shelf of any home dvd collection.
Beware of watching this movie with preconceptions of this being the next shrek, or incredibles or any other CGI movie out there. This is an independent film that deserves alot of recognition not only because of how well it was done, but also because of the cleanliness it held, and still came off as... intelligently hilarious. Sure it's not all that to teenagers, but it might be to mom, dad and the under 10 group. Anyone else who understands clean humor will find this movie humorous as well, just don't watch it thinking it's geared towards adolesence... Because you will be disapointed.

This is a kids movie, plain and simple. And being a kids movie, it is a very well done kids movie [not to mention it is an independant film, which rarely are worth mentioning]. I enjoyed watching a movie with clean humor for once, though I wouldnt watch this movie all the time, it was fun to just sit back and relax, and watch a kiddie movie. A great funny, family friendly film. Beware of the fact that some of the jokes are corny, the rest are witty, sarcastic, and some just plain funny sometimes.

If you're scared, then rent it, you won't be disapointed in doing that. Your kids will love it [i think this is a better buy than chicken little].",1147996800,2,2767,4.409001956947162
2529402,4,B000EQ5UHS,"We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, right? But with director Cory Edwards at the helm of this fairy tale, things get changed ...just a wee bit.

Little Red (voiced by Anne Hathaway, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) wants out of the forest. She's not happy living in such a constrained society. She dreams of flying over the mountains and seeing what lay beyond. But bad things are afoot in the forest. Food establishments are closing due to a rash of recipe thefts. Little Red has to protect her and Granny's recipe book before it disappears as well. But who's behind these thefts? And for what reason? When Little Red arrives at Granny's house, the typical meeting with The Wolf occurs ...sort of. Granny (voiced by Glen Close, FATAL ATTRACTION) is tied up in the closet (or is she?) The Wolf asks Little Red lots of probing questions about her basket. And as Little Red discovers that The Wolf is not Granny, The Woodsman comes bashing through a window wielding his axe and acting murderous. But is he?

The police are called in to investigate this ""domestic disturbance"" and as Detective Nicky Flippers (voiced by David Ogden Stiers, M*A*S*H) soon discovers, many more strange things are happening than meets the eye. Granny has a triple-G tattoo on her neck and loves extreme sports (paying homage to xXx with Vin Diesel). The Wolf (voiced by Patrick Warburton, SKY HIGH) is actually a reporter researching the recent recipe thefts and feels that Granny and Little Red are at the center of it. The Woodsman (voiced by James Belushi, K-9) is just a Schnitzel-On-A-Stick salesman turned actor trying to find his inner Woodsman. And Little Red is simply a delivery girl who's disenchanted with the world around her.

Borrowing from just about every action film out there, HOODWINKED really works. Everything from THE MATRIX to CITY SLICKERS is referenced ...and it's done very well. The animation seems nearly old-fashioned and out-of-date, which actually adds a quaint quality to the film; it's not trying too hard to be something it isn't. It isn't FINDING NEMO or SHREK. It couldn't be with a budget only a fraction of what those two animation goliaths cost. This is an independent film (gotta love `em!), so money is stretched thin. Which leads me to my next point ...

When the film was put out at theaters (in limited release), it didn't have the marketing budget that Pixar and Disney had for theirs. Professional reviews were cool (to say the least), which leads me to wonder if this movie had been put out by Disney or Pixar what the reviews might have been like. With action figures at Toys-R-Us, computer games, posters, and God only knows what else, the financial ability of the production company might have weighed heavy on the minds of reviewers and how children (and adults) viewed it. Trust me, this IS an issue. Independent films struggle under the shadow of these huge film companies.

And here's the thing: this movie is GOOD. It's not perfect by any means, but it's fun, light, engaging, voiced well, animated fine, and uproariously entertaining. I especially enjoyed Twitchy the speed-talking squirrel whose brush with caffeine addiction makes for some of the funnier moments. I also liked Japeth the singing Goat, who takes a ride with Little Red through a mine that looks suspiciously like the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attraction at Disneyland. A little needling at the Disney corporation maybe? Loved it!

And who is the recipe thief, you may be asking. Well that's something you'll HAVE to find out for yourself ...and it's worth it.",1147824000,,3565,4.864909390444811

2529404,2,B000EQ5UHS,"Unless you're ten years old or less, you might think you've been had if you buy or rent HOODWINKED.

Based on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, this animated feature begins as Red (Anne Hathaway) discovers the Wolf (Patrick Warburton) in Granny's bed, Granny herself (Glenn Close) being tied up in the closet. As the situation begins to escalate out of control, the Woodsman (James Belushi) crashes through the window brandishing an axe. The next thing the audience sees is Granny's house roped off with yellow crime scene tape and the four principals, now in the custody of several animal policemen for disturbing the peace, being questioned by the lead investigator, frog Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers).

Under interrogation by Flippers, each detainee tells his/her version of what led up to the confrontation in Granny's bedroom. As the pages of HOODWINKED literally flip back to the beginning four different times, we learn that (apparently) the Wolf is an investigative reporter, the Woodsman an actor wannabee, Granny a snow boarding enthusiast, and Red Riding Hood simply a deliverer of edible goodies. Indeed, there's a larger subplot, which is that the forest's various goodie manufacturer's are being put out of business by the theft of their recipes by an unknown perp; Granny is the last holdout.

Conceptually, this approach has promise; I can see it successfully applied to a modern re-telling of any classic fable that you'd care to mention. Unfortunately, the story writers went over the top revamping the traditional plot and the action becomes embarrassingly silly. At times, the viewer might think he's watching two different films grafted on to each other. Only the Wolf remains particularly engaging from beginning to end; Warburton's voice performance is perfect for the role.

An infinitely more clever and endearing film was 2005's WALLACE & GROMIT: CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. If, like me, animated features aren't high on your list of diversions, see this one instead of HOODWINKED.",1147392000,,2013,5.184615384615385

Disney has made an attempt with the decently animated but not very entertaining Chicken Little.

Here we have Hoodwinked, not particularly well animated, but the writing is above par for a children's movie, a kind of retelling of Little Red Riding Hood using the Rashomon method.

Anne Hathaway provides some dry delivery as Red Riding Hood, when asked what she is called when she isn't wearing her hood, she pauses just long enough before answering ""I usually have it on."" David Ogden Stiers, usually reliable in most of the work he does, is still reliable in this move.  Patrick Warburton all but steals the show as the Wolf.  And there were a few moments that surprised me, like how Granny got tied up for example.

The filmmakers put this movie together on a fraction of the budget of Pixar, Disney and Dreamworks, and while the quality of the animation reflects this, the quality of the script doesn't.",1147046400,5,1174,4.702439024390244

Hoodwinked was truly refreshing.

It's like the Hoodwinked producers started out to build a funky, fun airplane and ended up with a go-cart.  Both have a body, seats, controls, wheels, an engine, etc., however, an airplane has capabilities built in that the go-cart will never have.  Starting with a wonderfully twisted concept, Hoodwinked is not that well written, has yesteryear's CG animation style plus music that sometimes carries a tune but rarely the heart.  If you like movies at a go-cart level, be my guest.  Go-carts can be fun, but they don't soar.  Adjust your expectations accordingly.",1146700800,11,789,5.109375
2529423,4,B000EQ5UHS,"I remember hearing a version of the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears where she makes her way through the three bowls of porridge and the three chairs, to make her way upstairs to the three beds.  In the Baby Bear's bed she discovers a wolf dressed up as grandma.  They do the whole ""What big eyes you have"" routine and the wolf gobbles down Goldilocks.  We should not be surprised by this turn of events because, after all, this was a two story house... (add rim shot here).

""Hoodwinked"" is decidedly in the same mold as that story.  Actually, the basic point of this version of Little Red Riding Hood is that there are (at least) four stories to be told, because in addition to Red and the Wolf, there is Grandma (bound in the closet instead of in the Wolf's belly), and the crazy Woodsman with his axe.  The police want to know what is going on and that means Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers), a long-legged frog, and Chief Grizzly (Xzbit), a bear, need to question the four principles one by one to get to the bottom of it all.  Just think of it as ""Rashomon"" played out by Mother Goose.

Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway) tells her version first, which is close to the original.  But then we have have the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton), who turns out to be an undercover reporter, the Woodsman (James Belushi), who is has been selling schnitzel when he wants to be in show business, and Granny (Glenn Close), who is into X-sports when she is not baking goodies.  In fact, the underlying question in all of these misadventures seems to be the mysterious ""Goody Bandit.""

Actually, the supporting characters of this fractured fairey tale come across as being more interesting, especially Twitchy (Cory Edwards), Japeth the Goat (Benjy Gaither), and Boingo (Andy Dick).  Todd Edwards & Cory Edwards came up with the story and the screenplay, and co-directed this animated film along with Tony Leech, and they certainly make a effort to push every button they can think of when it comes to working in references to fairy tales and pop culture.  But the net result is neither as joyful nor as caustic as it should be for something like ""Hoodwinked"" to really work and I round up on this film because I appreciate the attempt even if the execution is a bit underwhelming.",1146614400,5,2281,4.574938574938575

Why would I say something like that to the other films which have gotten great reviews and made lots of money at the box office? Because it's simply good, clean, fun and short.

Good because it's cleverly animated to look like a 'cartoon', which I think is the first time I've seen this concept in a CG film. Take Twitchy for example, that squirrel moves a 100 miles a second! I've never seen a character animated in CG like that.

Clean because nothing in this movie suggested anything that adults would understand just to appeal to them. And even though it was clean and targeted for children viewing, I still enjoyed it as an adult. Even the music was made specifically for the movie. And believe it or not, all the songs were enjoyable.

Fun because the comedy, in my opinion, is top notch. Nothing over the top, just a lot of silliness that you just can't help but laugh at. Sure there are parody elements borrowed from movies like Fletch and xXx, it was all cleverly tied together and very funny.

I went to see this movie with an open mind, hoping for the best, but unfortuantly, I got much less than that.  Hoodwinked was about the ""true"" story of Little Red Ridinghood.  To me, it seemed a lot like the premise of the Shrek movies.  It didn't start too bad, but a half hour into the 80 minute movie, I was ready to leave.  The story was used and unoriginal.  Even many of the jokes were the same jokes that I have heard in other movies.  Just after the story problems, was the animation.  I am a big fan of CGI if it is done well (Pixar), but unfortanly, CGI allows movies like this to be made that look like an older video game on a big screen.  CGI also allows bad movies like this to be pumped out on such a frequent basis that plot seems to be overlooked, and it is all about making a profit now.

Hoodwinked lacked in the visuals area. In fact, when I saw the trailers, I myself didn't think it would be worth seeing based on the quality of CG. After seeing the movie (twice) I can honestly say that I'm glad I didn't go with my gut on this one.

What Hoodwinked lacks in visual prowess it makes up for in story and humor. The story keeps pace, the characters stay true to themselves, and the humor is well spaced and never goes into overkill mode. On top of that, the soundtrack is mighty fine, coloring the movie with an array of clever, catchy, and sometimes humorous songs.

Now, this IS technically a kids movie, (I think kids will love it) and the kid elements are obvious, what with an extreme granny, funny talking animals, and a villain that's pretty much obvious early on in the movie. I have to tell you though, I'm 21, I've seen it twice, and I'm still not sick of it. But any movie genre are based on personal preference.

I only regret that these guys didn't have enough money to get the movie done at Pixar level. I think it would have been a hit if the visuals were more appealing.

2529441,3,B000EQ5UHS,"""Hoodwinked"" is an animated comedy with a good story, a colorful array of characters, and a silliness factor that occupies more of the material than it should; I have a feeling that a ""Shrek"" rival has yet to be made. What makes the film unique is that its a creative retelling of the Brothers Grimm tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" from four different perspectives, in the classic ""Rashomon"" tradition. Apparently, the story is a lot more complicated than we could have imagined, with Red, Grandma, the Wolf, and the Woodsman intersecting with outside characters and having more off-the-wall motives than we thought.

Instead of being the cute, innocent little girl from our childhood bedtime story, Red (Anne Hathaway) is a strong-willed, independent go-getter who makes deliveries for her Grandma (Glenn Close). The Wolf (Jeff Warburton) is not the bloodthirsty predator we always thought him out to be, but is instead a journalist out for a lead on the notorious Goody Bandit, a fiend who is stealing the treat recipes from every bakery in the forest (he is accompanied by a super-fast talking squirrel). The Woodsman (Jim Belushi) is, in fact, an actor hoping for a spot in a commercial, who manages to crash into Grandma's living room at a key moment, ax in hand. And Grandma has a secret or two of her own.

We are introduced to a few other characters at the beginning of the film, before the key players step in to tell their versions of the story. Private Detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) has been contacted to investigate the crime scene and to interrogate each of the four players, but he must also tame down the impatient Chief Grizzly (rap artist Xzibit) who is quick to pinpoint perps without evidence. Chief Grizzly's assistants are Officer Stork (Anthony Anderson) and the Three Little Pigs, who manage to fit the stereotypical image of police officers quite well with their pot bellies and gluttonous eating habits.

That's all you'll get out of me, because explaining the details of the four perspectives will spoil everything, suffice it to say that each viewpoint lands the respective character in their Grimm tale position. Each character seems like the Goody Bandit. Maybe one is, or maybe not. But most of the film is each person recapping the day's events, with a climax involving the discovery of the Goody Bandit's identity and the race to stop his dasterdly plot to blow up the forest.

The film would have been more fun, and better for that matter, had it not concerned itself with the Goody Bandit and stayed close knit with it's ""Rashomon"" style bulk. Here is a film with a great idea, and with brilliant takes on the original Red Riding Hood story, that is far too eager to jump to the pop-culture references and to ensue long-running gags. With each new joke, you become frustrated because you are already into film's mystery plot. This is a case in which the humor works as a distraction and not a natural output of the material.

The key to making a successful animated film is to have actors whose voices give favor to their animated counterparts. This is something that ""Hoodwinked"" does right. Where 2003's ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas"" fell short was that you could picture the actors in the recording studio speaking their lines into a microphone. In ""Hoodwinked"" you can close your eyes and imagine the characters themselves, not the actors, taking part in the dialogue.

An elegant fusion of hand drawings and CGI will captivate audience members, especially the little ones, who by now are more likely students of ""Shrek,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Madagascar."" The animation itself is, however, not quite enough to overshadow the film's cock-eyed story, but it is a good companion to the characters. Even in the action scenes--a wild roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft, an avalanche-snowboarding sequence straight out of ""XXX,"" and a brawl aboard a ski chute--everything looks just as it would in real life, and the physics maintain their plausibilities with the characters onscreen. I am, however, questioning the PG rating, because nothing in the film compares to the loud action sequences in ""The Incredibles"" or the prologue family slaughter in ""Finding Nemo.""

Maybe I'm complaining too much. The fact is that ""Hoodwinked"" is just as well-made as it has to be, but in an age where the ""Shrek"" films have taken society by storm, and ""The Incredibles"" have run rampant at the box office with a continuing series in talks, you'd better have a film that knows how to handle its material the right way. You can marvel at the film's humor and animation, but in the end the movie itself should have a little more reason for existing.

The Wolf [Patrick Warburton] is actually an investigative reporter, the Woodsman [James Belushi] a yodeling actor.  & Granny [Glen Close]?  She's an eXtreme sportswoman.  Or is there another suspect?  & where does cute bunny Boingo [Andy Dick] fit in?  Using clever froggy Poroit-type [David Ogden Stiers] Nicky Flippers to investigate what police Chief Grizzly [Xzibit] hoped was an open-and-shut case of looking for the Goody Bandit, -Hoodwinked- tells a traditional story in a *very* non-traditional way.

The animation is a bit crude, & uses standard tropes like bluebirds [why?  1 hardly ever sees real bluebirds these days] & a HUGE eyed Red ... & that's about the size of it.  But the writing's kewl & the songs better than standard.  & it made me laugh several times, so...",1138838400,2,1129,4.848167539267016
2529464,4,B000EQ5UHS,"HOODWINKED revolves around the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood.  In that classic story, Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandma are both eaten by a wicked wolf, but are saved by the Woodsman as he cuts open the wolf's stomach while it sleeps. Red and Grandma escape and they replace themselves with hugh rocks. When the wolf awakes and sees what happens he tries to get them, but his heavy stomach makes him an enemy no more.

Well, as can see from SHREK or from reading some fractured fairy tales, that might not always be the case. In HOODWINKED it turns out that Red is the delivery girl for her Grandma. Grandma is a world famous chef and is one of only a handful of individuals who hasn't been put out of business by a recipe thief. When Red arrives at Granny's she see right through the wolf's disguise, but before anyone can do anything Granny pops out of the closet all tied up and the Woodsman come crashing through the wall with a giant log. When the police arrives, an brilliant inspector attempts to unravel the mystery and find out exactly who's stealing all the recipes.

For the most part, critics have been panning HOODWINKED while audiences have loved it. The film does make a lot of references from everything to SHREK to THE MATRIX to the famous Japanese film, RASHOMON.  Some might find thie allusions dizzying.  I enjoyed them.  Not only that, but I loved the story. I figured out about 5 minutes into the movie who the real thief was, yet that didn't diminish the film for me in anyway. I got caught up in the storytelling and wanted to see how things would end up. The movie sets things up so there could be a sequel. I don't say this often, but this film left me hoping they will make a sequel.",1138752000,3,1730,4.407523510971787
2529465,3,B000EQ5UHS,"Something happens deep on the woods. The story is reconstructed from multiple viewpoints. What is truth? No, it's not the classic Kurosawa flick Rashomon but rather Hoodwinked, the retelling of the Little Red Riding Hood story for our modern times. The story is just that: LRRH goes off to deliver goodies in a forest full of failing goodie-shop businesses. She has gigantic, careful-don't-poke-em eyes and a dreary demeanor. Why? She feels trapped in a dead end job. On her way, she meets a fey rabbit, and a wolf with his manic squirrel sidekick. Matters take themselves to Grandma's House, where things rapidly get out of hand and a lederhosen-attired giant flies through the window. A detective is called to sort things out, and the stories begin. A plot to corner the goody market is exposed, and all ends well.

The movie is of interest because it's independent. The animation looks pretty standard, and the story line, while cute, gets a bit tired after a while. The granny is, of course, a hoot but I agree with the kid reviewer that the songs are darned weird. Think ""Jonathan Richmond"". Maybe that was the effect the filmmakers were after. Anyway, the squirrel is funny. OK as a Saturday distraction but not much else.",1138492800,,1228,4.819905213270142
2529466,1,B000EQ5UHS,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. My kids were entertained (ages 3 1/2 and 7 1/2) but my husband and I thought it was awful. It is disjointed and painfully unhumorous. The jokes are really lame and predictable and the music is just randomly slapped together. It tries way too hard to be hip and reference pop culture but it fails miserably. The characters are incredibly annoying (esp. the hillbilly singing goat, the hyperactive squirrel, etc). One song that plays when Red Riding Hood thinks she's figured something out that makes her sad is called 'Red is Blue' and it is SO bad it is like a skit about a bad movie. AVOID THIS MOVIE",1138492800,7,641,4.487179487179487
2529467,5,B000EQ5UHS,"This indie animated flick is like most indie films, a little rough around the edges, a little different than the run of the norm, and endlessly clever.  I think its a bit unfair to label it as a Shrek-type film.  True, the humor is a bit more adult, while also giving some humor for kids to enjoy; however, the humor itself is a bit more subtle and doesn't rely on poop and fart jokes.

What I loved most about the film was its presentation of the story.  It begins almost Quentin Tarantino like by showing the ending.  Red, the wolf, the granny and the woodsman all end up the Granny's house.  But what really happened?  Who is behind this?  Is everything as it seems?  I love stories that do this.  From The Simpson's episode involving one day in the life of the townspeople, to Pulp Fiction and even Go, these stories always make me smile to see how everything fits together.  Hoodwinked is no different.  Finding the truth to what really happened and why everyone was amassed at Granny's house is clever, funny and original for a cartoon.  One complaint was that I figured out who the ""mastermind"" behind everything was from the very beginning.  However, its not really that important and the ride is entertaining the entire way.

The humor, like I said, is usually a little more subtle than what we're normally used to in kid's flicks.  Yes there are some pratfalls and over-the-top style moments; but the true humor rests in some clever one liners and some of the songs and events.  In particular, the lyrics to Red is Blue is terrific and had me and my friend rolling in the aisles.  There are some pop-culture references, but what Hoodwinked did really well was play with conventions, introduce some terrific characters and use an excellent voice cast that includes Glenn Close, Anne Hathaway, Andy Dick (who I normally hate but is perfect in this role), James Belushi and regular voice actor for Family guy Patrick Warburton.

Hoodwinked also slyly presents a moral for its viewers, one that is important not only for children but also adults.  Sometimes, things aren't always as they appear.  Don't judge a book by its cover because if you look a bit closer you will find the truth.  Hoodwinked's animation might not be up to the standards of Pixar or even Dreamworks, but behind its rough around the edges exterior lies a movie that is hillariously witty, subtle and heart-warming.",1138320000,2,2392,4.685851318944844
2529468,5,B000EQ5UHS,"This movie is great in many ways. First off, the story is kind of like clue. Red, The Wolf, The Wood guy and Granny are all being accused. But none of their stories are lies, and they all make sense on how it works. Like, Red is going down a railroad and an avalanche goes off. Later in the movie, you see how the avalanche started, see how granny got tied up, see how it makes sense. What's really funny is that the Wolf is the speaker ""Kronk"" in The Emproere's New Groove. Guess what his assistant is? A squirrel, gone wild! But who really is the murder? Find out if you watch this. Don't lishten to the folks that say the movie has bad animations, really, they must be blind. The graphics are close to the The Incredibles. This is a must see movie. YOu will not regret this. Please watch it, it's woth the money!",1137974400,2,815,4.197452229299363
2529469,2,B000EQ5UHS,"The theater was packed with adults and children waiting for a Shrek-like fairy tale adventure. Early in the show it becomes obvious that this is a first attempt by a new company. The animation is only so-so. For instance, when the wolf is in the river, there is overlapping animation between his legs and the water. Their animation software (or their skills) needs improvement. The story had promise, but was supplemented by musical numbers that were a little strange and too long. They really had to stretch to get the movie to feature length. The characters were OK but all seemed to have an attitude problem. No one was happy with their fairy-tale life. The best character, and the only one that got adult laughs in our theater, was the squirrel, who was kind of a cross between Chip & Dale and Scrat (Ice Age). The kids all laughed in a few places, but the adults didn't seem to find it more than mildly amusing in spots. This is not a movie I'd pay to see twice. Wait and rent it.",1137715200,7,985,4.447513812154696
