8469666,5,B005F64ZKK,"Islamic extremists don't hesitate to lie. They embrace Taquia, the principle allowing them to lie to non-Muslims---and even the less fanatical members of their religion on behalf of violent Jihad. This 45 minute documentary reals a number of real life cases involving terrorists living in America attempting to deceive their neighbors and naive associates. Thankfully, the FBI and prosecutors were able to convince juries to convict these monsters. We are in an existential war to the death with fanatical Islam. It will not end anytime in the near future.",1411257600,,556,5.258426966292135
