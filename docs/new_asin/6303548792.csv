It's like the Misery for teens. The only thing I hated about this is that Gosselaar was killed...why kill him? That mad me mad because his character was likable and I felt what he was going through and then she had to kill him...argh. Anyway it was somewhat of a good movie fueled down by the cant act Dean Ryan.",1094428800,,621,4.408695652173913
7850546,4,6303548792,"This film is like a fatal attraction for generation x audience. I baught this film because of Soleil Moon Frye(of Punky Brewster/Sabrina,Teenage witch fame) I am a big fan of her and found this movie plesantly surpising. The film has a highschool girl who has pschological problems and has acrush on Soleils boyfriend,kidnapping him after his accident. It's like Fatal Attraction and Misery in a 90210 type storyline which aint too bad, its a descent film. The film also stars Mark Paul Gosselaar who is just ok in the film and Soleil is excellent! If your a fan of Soleil its wort buying at least at a cheaper used price, no movie especially on vhs, you should spend over 40 dollars(not even that much maybe 10 or less) dvd is taking over, so the companys that overcharge on vhs will be sorry because nobody in their right mind will buy them. Well anyways I will stop with my preaching and hopefully you will find the film for less than 20 bucks,thanks.",1000684800,2,954,4.584795321637427

It's about this crazy girl that keeps this guy she likes in hiding against his will.  She kills to keep him with her.  It's very lame.",991612800,3,282,3.982142857142857
