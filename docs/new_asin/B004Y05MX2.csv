8447812,3,B004Y05MX2,It is a informative DVD and I have no complains with it. If you can learn with DVD this product is as good as any but to be honest I have started one on one lessons with a local teacher. I will always have this DVD to go back and check out when ever I need to.,1431734400,,260,3.5789473684210527
8447813,4,B004Y05MX2,Good DVD. Pretty easy for an experienced player. Would be faster and easier to just learn from a chart. Will make you think differently about chord positionings and fingerings.,1425859200,,176,5.103448275862069
8447814,5,B004Y05MX2,"I have a number of dvd's by Mr. Sternal and every one of them are great and present a lot of information. I think these dvd's are a great addition to any collection, even if you're familiar with a subject the dvd's are laid out in a way that makes them very easy to look up a subject and see it explained in detail.",1421452800,,315,3.9375

8447816,2,B004Y05MX2,"I purchased this item on Amazon.com using my Prime membership. Shipping was perfect and timing was better than expected. The DVD although it says for ""easy"" it is difficult to understand and I am not able to use because I do not understand what they are talking about. If you are a beginner without a professional instructor stay away from this product. I do play alot of other instruments so I have a music background but I am beginner level guitar and it is way over my head. I was very disappointed in my purchase. From the description you could not tell that there was a possible problem. Thank you I hope this comment will help others who are trying to decide what to do.

8447817,5,B004Y05MX2,This DVD is awesome he shows you the practical application of what is taught. Most videos only cover the topic but don't actually show you how to apply it. I own most of his DVDs and he does not disappoint. If you want to learn every position on the fretboard and what keys to use when soloing this DVD is for you. I highly recommend it for beginners to intermediate guitar players.,1358726400,10,382,4.319444444444445
