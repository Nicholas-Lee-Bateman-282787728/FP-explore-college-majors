1396017,5,B0000560QI,"In ""Un Chien Andalou"", Luis Buuel and Salvador Dali create a surreal film that undoubtedly influenced and led to other films and even comercials that we've all seen. I was particularly reminded of the images Pink Floyd would later use for their covers and concerts. The use of music (and the music itself) is fantastic, adding to the humor, melacholy and drama of the scenes and actors, who themselves are excellent, even without a single spoken word. One might think that's easy, but then one would only need to see Jean Cocteau's ""Blood of a Poet"" to see that it's not.  ""Land Without Bread"" is equally surreal, but earie as well since it's actually a documenatry and what you see is real. The obscene poverty of a small spanish town is a fitting subject for Buuels first and only documentary.  Filmed in the early 30's, one is suddenly struck with the uncomfertable realization of what one is viewing; some scenes being downright grotesque, all the more so since they are not staged; yet in the hands of a master like Buuel.",982195200,12,1027,4.668508287292818
1396043,5,B0000560QI,"""Un Chien Andalou"" is certainly one of the great surrealist films, though I'd disagree with an earlier reviewer who claimed that without it, we might not have the works of some of the great directors that followed. That's because in 1928, when the film appeared, surrealism was already several years old as a literary movement (Dada was even older), and the surrealists were fascinated with film from the very beginning. In addition, there were important avant garde films before ""Chien"" --- e.g., Abel Gance's ""Un Folie du Docteur Tube"" (1915), which experimented with bizarre distortions and surreal-like imagery more than a decade earlier. Film, after all, is to a great degree an outgrowth of literature --- the earliest narrative films were frequently little more than cinematic adaptations of stage plays or other types of fiction. Ergo, *someone* was bound to adapt surrealist fiction to the film medium -- it just happened to be Bunuel who leapt to the challenge. Not that Bunuel didn't do a brilliant job --- he did; it's just that if it hadn't been Bunuel, it would've been someone else.
As for the film itself, there's not much to say that hasn't been said by other reviewers. The nudity (which includes overt sexual fondling) must have been pretty shocking for 1928 audiences, though it was less ""radical"" in its emotional charge than the opening sequence with the famous eye-slice. Surrealist painting, along with fiction, anticipated virtually everything in ""Chien"" -- shock effects, juxtapositions of incongruous imagery, sexual motifs -- all these were a standard part of the surrealist pallette, and Bunuel used them masterfully. The image of the ants swarming out of a hole in a character's palm was a specific image mirrored in painting of the time (e.g., Dali), but at least Bunuel gave these graphics a sense of spurious continuity, to the extent that viewers get the impression of narrative without any of the cognitive satisfaction. Surrealists, after all, weren't interested in cognition; they wanted to transcend it by exploring oneiric realms that had never been broached before. It's that sense of transcendence that ""Un Chien Andalou"" manages to achieve if seen in the right spirit, though not everyone will be able to empathize with it on that level.",1020902400,4,2279,5.096256684491979
1396044,5,B0000560QI,"""Un Chien Andalou"" (or ""An Andalusian Dog,"" a title which has effectively nothing to do with the film) is virtually a trailer to Luis Bunuel's entire career, containing all the themes the surrealist would later tackle in masterpiece after masterpiece.  Actually, that is far from a fair statement.  While ""Un Chien"" is merely 16 minutes long, it is still exceptionally artful, even while it is anti-artistic (that is against everything that had come to be synonymous with art).  It is still a delightfully subversive testament to the possibilities of art; possibilities weighed down by years of middle class expectations and oppression.
  In this, and many other ways, it is a wicked slap to the face of modern right wing sensibilities, and not only formally, but structurally as well. Take the infamous eye-cutting scene for instance. Not only is the content shocking, but the editing. As Bunuel holds the razor to the girl's eye, the camera cuts to a shot of a thin cloud bisecting the moon. Conditioned movie audiences will assume this is a metaphor for the eye-cutting, and think they are to be spared the atrocities. But, Bunuel quickly cuts mercilessly to the violent act anyway. In ways like this he infuriates standards set up by typical cinema of every era, and all this back in 1928!

  Yet there are still more merits to ""Un Chien Andalou,"" another amazing thing being that it can be at once brilliantly structured and spontaneous, in itself a complete paradox.  I can not say that any later film, even in Bunuel's arch, has ever achieved this.  So, in this way, ""Un Chien Andalou"" is the only completely true example of surrealism in film.
  I hope this has prompted you to view this film, as I can recommend to it no end.  I own a copy and see it quite often, just for a little inspiration until my next viewing.  Every time I find it to be fresh and liberating.  It is a film that has the retro, razor-blade formula down pat, and I'm just waiting for it to resurface as a major force in pop art and culture.  If everyone were to view this film, art would not be seen as paint and popsicle sticks.",1013299200,4,2110,4.631720430107527
1396045,5,B0000560QI,"In qualifying this class of films it's impossible any attempt of impartiality: you love the repulsive, anticlerical, explosive images of ""El perro andaluz""or you hate the movie and are loathed. Or perhaps a blend of the two sensations.  Surrealism is just these: not rational images, but ones as extracted from the deeper layer of the mind: horrors and pleasures. Buuel loved these and of course made these films very well. The own title is in full politically uncorrect, as Andaluca ever has been seen in Spain as the more delayed and poor region of Spain, in a bitter mock of allusion to Garca Lorca, the Andalusian poet contemporary of Buuel, Dali, etc. ""Land withouth Bread"" is only a hard documental over the terrific poor conditions in the region of Las Hurdes by the decade of 1920's. Fortunately that doesn't exists many time ago.",1005177600,,838,4.86013986013986
1396046,5,B0000560QI,"This short seventeen-minute film has some of the most famous images in cinema history.  By famous scenes I don't mean epic action scenes from famous hollywood blockbusters.  Please don't expect scenes like the one in Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Harrison ford is being chased by a huge boulder.  What I mean by famous is that in 1928, this film shocked the world.  I'm not a surrealist, and when I watched this movie for the first time (a year ago, I'm 20 years old right now)  I didn't understand anything or what surrealism was.  I read up on the subject and I now have a really good grasp on the subject.  Yet I still don't understand the movie.  That is because this movie is not supposed to make any sense.  So please, if you're like me and like intellectual challenges, go ahead and buy the movie.  But if you're expecting a blockbuster film, save your money and order HBO.  It is amazing how Bunuel and Dali were able to put their nightmares on film.  Yet the most amazing thing about this film is not the images or the techniques, but the shocked reaction from the viewers who watch it expecting to see the story of an Andalusian dog.  This is what makes it such a transcendent movie.  Such a little piece of film caused and continous to cause so much shock.  Enjoy...
The Land Without Bread (*****):  I don't know too much about documentaries but I think it was one of the first attempts by a filmaker to try to wake up society.  This documentary uses some cynical and disturbing humor to make the viewer feel uncomfortable by watching humans and animals dying from disease and famine.  As one watches the film it is unclear what the difference is between the animals and the Hurdano people, for both have no rights or future in this world, and eventually both end up sharring the same fate.  The language and tone of the film is not supposed to be ""politically correct"", for the purpose of the film is to show how politically incorrect governments were at the time.  Hopefully more people watch this documentary for a lot of those real-life scenes continue to happen everyday due to negligent governments.  After watching this film, and then turning on CNN to see more famine and social injustice, one can't help but wonder how we humans can't learn from history.",1004918400,4,2275,4.554187192118227
1396047,5,B0000560QI,"I saw bits and pieces of this movie when I was about 8 years old and I remember a while later I saw my first Salvador Dali drawing in my aunt's friends house. It was an actual print and both the drawing and movie made a deep impression on me. So much so, that I've searched long and hard for this movie and I was not disapointed when I finally watched it fully now as an adult.
It is, above all, a work of art and an experiment in Surrealist film. Luis Bunel and Salvador Dali teamed up to create a disturbing and revolutionary film that has influenced film makers for years.
If you think modern art is trash or would feel queesy about watching an eyeball being sliced in half...then this video is not for you.
The video quality is excellent and the documentary included in the VHS version is a welcome bonus. Overall, it's a great video and worth the price.",1002931200,2,858,4.269938650306749
1396048,3,B0000560QI,"I assume if you're buying this, you know what you're getting.  What the other reviews don't mention is that this is a poor quality video.  Granted, you don't expect a silent film to look like last week's Tom Hanks favorite, but my copy of this product looked like it had been through an x-ray machine.
No subtitles on Un Chien (though you don't really need them).
Hope this helps you make you're purchase decision.",1002672000,12,414,4.581081081081081
1396049,3,B0000560QI,"Un Chien Andalou has a number of startling images - which amount to nothing as they do not mean a thing and were not meant to. It would be a mere curiousity from 1928 except that Bunuel discovered that you could provoke hilarity by editing two images together which were not related. The resulting lack of linearity is the basis for much of Monty Python's humor. It is an anarchic sense of humor - daring to challenge the need for a punchline. In order for it to work, you need some unusual situations and images. This film has them in abundance. A creative little film. Clever, but hardly anything that could be called a masterpiece. Note that it is only a few minutes long.",988848000,,675,4.451612903225806
1396050,5,B0000560QI,"""Un Chien Andalou"" is the greatest surrealist film of all time. It introduced the genius of Luis Buuel and shows how easily surreal art translates to film. Made in collaboration with notorious painter Salvador Dali, this film is like a dream. There are images that are unforgettable (not least that famous slicing of the eyeball at the beginning) and the photography is hypnotic and the staging of the images is brilliant. The film is erotic, romantic, violent and daring even today. It stands as one of Buuel's great works and one of the true classics of cinema. It is a complete work of art that dares to show a mix of the erotic or sexual attraction with violence. The next film in this video, ""Land Without Bread,"" is also a great documentary that captures with gritty detail and stark realism the poverty of Las Hurdes and it also has scenes that are very memorable, like one where the grooms of a wedding compete on horseback to tear the head off a chicken suspended from a wire in the middle of town. Here are two films that show the craft of a great filmmaker.",987724800,8,1068,4.538860103626943
1396051,5,B0000560QI,"Acclaimed as a surrealist masterpiece, ""Un Chien Andalou"" aggressively disconnects itself from narrative flow. The  creators of this short film. Luis Buuel and Salvador Dal, fully intended there to be no links between successive  scenes. Fortunately this didn't inhibit their dreaming up of some of the most striking moments ever to be projected  upon the silver screen. The opening focuses on a man (Luis Buuel) stropping his cut-throat razor, honing it to a  perfect edge. Stepping onto the balcony, he gazes at the moon. This celestial orb is instantly replaced with a woman  and, enlarging rapidly, her left eye. The bare blade then descends on her unprotected pupil, a graphic incident.
  Designed to shock, which it still does almost 70 years later, quick editing removes the image before it has time to  fully sink in. Suddenly the viewer is faced with a nun-like figure weaving uncertainly down the road on a bicycle.  There is no bridge to the previous horror, although this mysterious person does provide a number of objects which  resurface at odd intervals. Later there is the unusual sight of a man (Robert Hommet) hauling two grand pianos, each  stuffed with the putrefying remains of a donkey, as he trudges towards a cowering woman. He is  also unfortunate enough to have a hole in his hand, where the ants live. None of this is significant.
  A marvellous aspect of something as wilfully bizarre as ""Un Chien Andalou"" is that almost any interpretation can be  drawn from the images shown. Perhaps every single scene is random and unconcerned with any other, although  Buuel certainly seems to have included items which are present throughout the film. In some ways the repeated  glimpses of these things in situations where they shouldn't be adds to the confused feel, enhanced by the off-putting  and nonsensical time-markers deployed.
  The eternal themes of life, death, lust and love are thrown up at various points, although there is no framework on  which to attach these emotions. This is of no consequence though as Buuel has already hurried onto the next  sequence, violently cutting so that the desired woman becomes naked in a flash - a picture of what are ardent suitor  really sees. ""Un Chien Andalou"" does not require such deep analysis though, being much more a film which should be  purely experienced. It achieves that which Buuel and Dal aimed for and, with a live music accompaniment, is  unstoppable!",986688000,3,2437,4.9727722772277225
1396052,5,B0000560QI,"You have to admire the temerity of Buuel and Dali to create this piece of material circa 1928, when it was going to cause an outrage in that taboo period. Buuel allegedly took stones to the premiere to throw at the critics. I have watched two sonorised versions with different soundtracks, the original, and one by Mauricio Kagel, which I prefer. It includes a menacing growling dog, which is appropriate for this film because it is like the man is imposing himself on the woman like a mean dog, and she repels him. It is a very accomplished piece of work for that era, well crafted, and showed the promise of Buuel, which turned out to be legendary. A magnificent landmark and watershed of artistic film making.",985737600,2,712,4.6141732283464565
7931590,2,B0000560QI,"This tape includes two very different pieces from Buuel (directed at not too distant time from each other, the late 1920s and the early 1930s). The first is Un Chien Andalou, which is credited as being codirected by Salvador Dali. This surreal short must have been terribly shocking when it was made, but I think that more than 75 years later, a lot of its impact has softened, perhaps because its surreal tricks have appeared in a lot of later movies.
The second piece is flawed too, though at least is more interesting - and I think more polemical, also. It's a 30 minute documentary about life in one of Spain's poorest regions. What I find wrong about this movie is that while Buuel gleefully shows us the poverty and ignorance of the people living there, he doesn't have much clues (and doesn't seem to care much) of how to solve this. Now, 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then. And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of leftism that Buuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. Shockingly, in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the horror!. Buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation.
All in all, two pieces that have not aged well.",1171756800,,1403,4.616
7931591,5,B0000560QI,"I just watched Land Without Bread, or Las Hurdes, the only documentary directed by Luis Bunuel. The film is short, only 27 minutes, but it is long enough to portray enough human suffering to disgust. Images include a girl who lies in a road for two days and then dies. No one helps. The local schoolteacher instructs rows upon rows of malnourished children to respect the property of others. The schoolteacher feeds them bread, and makes them eat it immediately to keep their starving parents from taking it from them. They dip it into the only nearby source of water, a trickle running through a ditch where the pigs wallow. Bunuel illustrates with these sorts of images how these people are unbelievably pathetic, yet he clearly goes beyond this when he shows images of the developmentally challenged somehow teetering on the edge of life in a world where even the fittest can rarely overcome. ""Morons and dwarves are plentiful..."" says the narrator, but in some degree or other, all the people of the community are tragically moronic at every turn. They drink water from the ditch, yet somewhere within a reasonable distance is a river. They try to plant a crop, but the crop is washed away because they plant too near that river. They cook over an open fire indoors, but they don't make windows for themselves to let smoke out of their homes. They have no food for two months of the year, and yet mothers carry babies around in almost every shot. The viewer is left with the distinct impression that these people can't survive much longer, and there is certainly no optimism in sight when the film ends. How in the world can these people not plan a little better? The answer, I think, must lie in the intellectually suffocating nature of their hopelessness, the horrendous condition they feel swept away again and again along with every one of even the slightest currents of misfortune. Perhaps they've simply quit trying, it would seem.",1152144000,2,1941,4.7626112759643915
7931592,3,B0000560QI,"Recently, I purchased and viewed my first Luis Bunuel film, Los Olvidados (The Young and the Damned). The film is very good, including some incredibly poignant and unforgettable images. I then decided to purchase and view one of his earlier works, likewise considered a masterpiece of film, Un Chien Andalou/Land Without Bread. This is awful. A mish-mash of mush! Its only redeeming quality is its brevity. Once again, here we have a film that is given much more credit than it deserves, and I'm starting to think that the reason this often happens is that: a) the movies are old and therefore deserve respect for being ""groundbreaking"" b) they are ""enigmatic,"" which is the critically vogue term for ""confusing,"" which is often the polite term for ""stupid,"" which when inserted into the VCRs of sheltered and myopic film critics can be enigmatically transformed into ""intellectual."" What's more appalling than this film is the praise that is heaped upon it. So the eyeball scene is groundbreaking. So what? It's not all that! I suppose lifting up the blanket--twice--to view the dead baby was likewise groundbreaking. Try disgraceful. Un Chien Andalou/Land Without Bread is a mongrelization of meaningless movie-making that belongs on some dusty shelf in some vault catalogued for historical reference only. You've been warned.

Okay, perhaps I am being a little harsh, but it's just because I want you to realize that what you are getting in this film is all technique, and, yes, groundbreaking at that. For that reason and that reason alone, I give this project 3 stars. And that's being generous.",1099180800,5,1600,5.0606060606060606
7931593,5,B0000560QI,"'Un chien andalou' (1928) is the best-known film on this video and is a fascinating work in its own right, but the real masterpiece here is undoubtedly 'Land Without Bread' ('Las Hurdes'). As great as most of Bunuel's subsequent films would be, this 27-minute 1932 work arguably towers above them all. Calling it a documentary would not do justice to its unrivaled breadth: among other things, this film asks the questions 'what is a documentary?' and 'what is the role of the documentarist?', and this prevents us from using definitive, short-circuiting labels. In fact, no label could conceivably express this film's power. The controversy surrounding this work has three main sources: 1) some of the sequences have apparently been staged by Bunuel; 2) the impersonal narration seems in direct contrast to the pain and tragedy that unfolds on the screen; 3) so is Bunuel's choice of using Brahms's Fourth symphony as background music. For these reasons, cinephiles have been disagreeing for over 70 years about Bunuel's treatment of human and animal misery in this film. For me, his audacious technique creates a space - a window - between the viewer and the plight of the Hurdanos; it is this space that somehow transfigures their misery, rather than merely exploit it (as some have suggested). The film becomes a true initiation for the viewer: it provides a difficult, troubling but potentially life-changing experience. In the end, Bunuel's intentions do not matter as much as the impact his film can have on those who see it; and for this viewer, he has carved a moving, mysterious and ineffable work.",1083369600,10,1608,5.02621722846442
7931594,5,B0000560QI,"I find these films interesting for their period statements.  At one time Un Chien Andalou was a statement about nothing.  It is now, however, an exploration into metaphor that we never could never leave undiscovered.  People may think they remain the same but their symbols are reused with new interpretations.  This movie is like lost love rediscovered, forgetting the reason for the loss.
Land Without Bread is such a racist, bigoted statement that it boggles the mind.  Imagine a time when some human existence could be so distant that it was judged only appropriate for a carny sideshow.  This movie is like a right wing view to a kill, totally without sensitivity or compassion.

One guy on the video ( well my version of it ( which has two versions of the film ))says that this is a film about the sex-war and yada yada ya while another reviewer says this film is "" indefinable ""......so hold on if even a reviewer thinks this film is indefinable than what chance do we have of knowing......effectively zilch!
We may have our own opinions on this film but the thing with this is that each is valid. If you hate this film for the basic fact that it didn't make sense.....you would be right because it effectively doesn't
So why watch it? As funny as this may seem I don't really have an answer for that question. Blind fascination perhaps, that's all!
As I was saying I have two versions of this. One that Bunuel used with the soundtrack of Wagner's Tristan Und Isolde, which you might find isn't fitting with the film ( perhaps that's the whole point ). The other soundtrack is made by Mauriccio Kagel which is far more experimental and more jarring to the person who watches the film.
I don't know which version is used on the version that is sold to Americans.....neither do I know what the other film on the American version is like.

7931597,5,B0000560QI,"I had heard of Luis Bunuel from a number of sources, one of which was my mother, and also from various filmmakers in documentaries, in particular on the commentary track for the film Easy Rider with Dennis Hopper. I had also heard that he was the hero to many of the new-wave moviemakers of America and Europe during the 60's and 70's. So I knew, like Godard and Kurosawa, I'd have to see his stuff sooner or later, preferably sooner. Then came the tough question, where to begin? Bunuel, in a career that spanned fifty years, had made dozens of works, and many have been given praise time and time again. So, I found this short film on video-tape (I haven't just yet seen the documentary that accompanies it, Land without Bread, but I intend to), and being that it's less than twenty minutes long I knew I could watch it all the way without, at the worst, getting too bored. Luckily, I was not disappointed in the least. Un Chien Andalou (The Andalousian Dog) is one of the most breathtaking features ever produced, short or feature length, and the way it slips so gracefully between what could be considered something of a reality and a collague of images is nothing short of a miracle. True this could be seen as a the common movie-goer as a pretentious attempt at an ""art"" film, but Bunuel and his collaborator Salvadore Dali have seized the perfect technique in blending the ideal of storytelling and that of the ideal of a painter.
There is a story that I could see, however a simple one, which was all a filmmaker would need in the days when synchronized sound was a newborn child; a woman meets a man, they are in a room, he attempts to have his way with her, and then in goes from there. But since Bunuel and Dali are doing something that is entirely original the story isn't the issue- to give the viewer a feeling of a dream-world in front of their eyes they have to show things that could mean something deep or be an illusion of the senses, a feeling or instant of something out of this world slipping into an unconsciousness we only get to see when we are asleep. And because most of us forget what we see in dreams when we awake, the glimpses they put forth in the film, such as the ants rising out of the hand (my favorite, however creepy), the eye slashed in half, and the man (Dali himself) carrying the piano, are all the more stirring, and unforgettable. It might not be for everyone, but Un Chien Andalou is work of wondrous sensations to the soul.",1058486400,4,2469,4.416666666666667
