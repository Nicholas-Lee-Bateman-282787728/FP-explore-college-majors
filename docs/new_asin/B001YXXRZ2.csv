8348195,4,B001YXXRZ2,"Lucie (Natalia Dontcheva) and Marion (Vanessa Larre) have been together for five years, now Lucie wants to take their relationship to another level by including a child in their life. Marion however, is not sure that is what she wants. Set in Paris, the couple is limited in their options for even getting pregnant; artificial insemination is not available to lesbian couples nor is adoption.

The couple faces a relationship crisis as they work through the details of the roles that each woman will play, which the sperm donor to use and if the father should even be involved. As the women take this important next step in their journey together, they forge a `new world' for themselves.

Director Etienne Dhaene has created a delightful film, full of poignant moments in the couple's quest to have the children they desire.

Natalia Dontcheva and Vanessa Larre are comical and believable as lesbian couple Lucie and Maya, facing change and the unknown in their relationship. Gregory Fitoussi also stands out as Hugo, the baby's sperm donor who wants more involvement in the child's life than the women would like.

8348197,4,B001YXXRZ2,"To begin with, this film starts with a lesbian couple. That in itself is a plus! I get really bored with straight girl meets lesbian, they fall in love, become a couple. What happens next? You become a lesbian and then what, life starts on the other side?

This film clearly takes of the mystery with being a lesbian. It's about being in a relationship, having a baby, and what happens with the family when you do that. Also it is a movie about a country where lesbian love holds no legal recognition. Both political, funny and smart film! See it!",1306972800,22,547,4.415841584158416
8348198,5,B001YXXRZ2,"I found myself laughing, crying, being supportive, getting angry, but the bottom line was I felt like I knew these women personally. Their representation of the subject matter was spot on. I know of both gay men and women who have experienced wanting to have children and then have their partners ""adopt"" but were legally not able to. I was tremendouly impressed by the ""natural"" way all the actors represented their characters ...they were all excellent.  Andra and Natalia shined!!! I was immediately drawn into their situation and found myself wanting to do something to change the ""system.""  It's an absolutely delightful movie and I could not recommend it highly enough.",1290124800,27,675,5.072072072072072
