8410615,4,B003ZM81A6,"Good action flick. This guy Paul Logan seems relegated to B movies. He is handsome as anyone in Hollywood. Deep voice,lifts weights and is a Martial Artist to boot. Good plot and believable. The leading lady makes current female stars look like undernourished beanpoles! Martin Kove is in it and he always adds to any movie he is in.",1330041600,,333,4.661016949152542
8410616,1,B003ZM81A6,"After 14 minutes and 37 seconds this direct to video ""because-no-one-would-pay-to-watch-it"" debacle went into double fast forward so as to be ""done-with-it"" mode viewing.

Acting:
Are the people in this movie really actors? What can they possibly being doing their entire lives? It certainly hasn't been acting. Most are old enough that I surely would have heard of them so I checked on IMDB for my forgetfulness as to missed acting accolades. Well, we have ""Mega Piranha"", ""Aliens on Crack"", ""Vampires in Vegas"". The sad part is that many of the actors in this video have been churning out direct to video or TV spot roles  at the rate of half dozen a year since the '70s and '80s. The exception are the female actors with resums consisting of video shorts and TV roles starting in the '90s for the obvious ""younger females"" sell, reasons. Quantity over quality we always say.

Writing:
Stolen ideas from so many spy/action movies that there was not an original idea anywhere. There was the ""Matrix"" scene of have a gun in each hand and spin killing dozens that encircle you,  but whereas ""Matrix"" used high speed cameras and wires this cheap flick simply had the actors turn slowly as they mowed down the ""couldn't hit a barn from 30 feet bad people"". There was the usual spy room with a couple of monitors and GoogleEarth graphics with a cheap animation of a satellite doing some dance move in space - dumb! There were the Jolie ""Salt"" imitations that in their own right were poorly done ripoffs. Nearly finally, there were all the scenes shot in an industrial waste plant (as usual) with it's own resum of lots of overhead pipes and a room with my old chemistry lab tables - nasty. Finally, car chase scenes that must have secretly used little old ladies racing to Walmart for a Saturday morning sale.",1308182400,,1805,4.684542586750789
8410617,4,B003ZM81A6,"""Ballistica"" is a standard spy thriller with a few twists.  The car chases, fight scenes, gunfights, and weapons of mass destruction are all present.  The twists are the premise (martial arts ""forms"" combined with handguns) and some outrageous gunfight scenes.  The movie is fun to watch.  I give it four stars.

The Good:
* Paul Logan is a believable tough guy.  He naturally has a sensitive side.  And his character does grow throughout the movie.
* Martin Kove is a trustworthy team leader who inspires confidence in his subordinates.  While a minor character, he is almost a lead character.  He, too, makes decisions that change his life.
* Robert Davi is the once-trustworthy boss who now plays by the rules and politics.
* The setting-up of a sequel makes perfect sense.
* The CIA uses a worldwide reach rather than staying in a single foreign country.  Paul Logan gets around!
* Various non-action scenes or lines of dialog add to the realism and humanity of the film.  The characters come alive during those times rather than being one-dimensional fighting machines.
* The bad guys are the timeless standbys --- the Russians and the Chinese.  In true 007 style, Paul Logan has a female Russian or Chinese agent as support.

The Bad:
* The ability to dodge bullets by predicting their trajectory requires a large suspension of disbelief.
* The CIA is portrayed as being a bit sloppy, though that may be due to corruption rather than incompetence.
* The trailer is the entire movie.  Only a few slight twists remain, though they are more explanatory than essential plot points.  That is a serious defect with the way Asylum advertised this movie.
* The sound level was normalized much lower than it should have been.
* Some of the special effects (car scenes, fight scenes) have a low-budget look.

In summary: ""Ballistica"" is a fun action movie.  It is almost a five-star movie; I may rate it up after repeated viewings.",1306195200,4,1927,4.790909090909091

`How to you create a movie around martial arts and weapons as a form of self defense'.
GYMKATA tried something like this,Remember ?
GAME OF DEATH had some elements like this movie, Breaking the mold of what makes an action film.
Sure Chuck Norris or Stephen Seagal could have made a film like this,But there too old...Get the picture,Paul Logan is incredible to watch--Perhaps a throwback to yesterdays movie stars.
This must have been a labor of love for Gary Jones (director) and Tony Kandah(writer) they spent two years developing this martial arts hybrid of an action flick.",1305590400,,644,4.972222222222222
