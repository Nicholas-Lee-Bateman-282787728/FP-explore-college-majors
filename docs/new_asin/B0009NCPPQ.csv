2301909,4,B0009NCPPQ,"Many have said that Psycho Cop Returns originally had far more gore in its original form and that's why they gave this R-rated version such a bad review. I, however, have not seen the unrated version so I still had a good time with this version. It's a cheesy horror-comedy, sort of a cross between Maniac Cop and Intruder only with far more humor and t & a. There's a lot of cheesy one-liners courtesy of psycho cop himself Bobby Lee Shafer. Then there's the nudity. I counted 10 breasts. Two of those breasts belong to 1993 Penthouse Playmate of the Year Julie Strain. Julie Strain has went on to appear in over 100 b-movies and she always ""delivers"" the goods. If you want to see the kind of movie they used to show on USA Up All Night, I recommend Psycho Cop Returns. It might be low on gore, but it's high on entertainment.",1253059200,,828,4.348387096774194
2301910,2,B0009NCPPQ,"I remember seeing both this and the first part when I was in middle school and I remember a lot more gore. This DVD version of Psycho Cop 2 has all the gore and cheezy but brutal scenes cut out! Every time the Psycho Cop kills they only show the first part but leave out ALL the scenes showing the bodies. If you can, buy the origional cut on VHS and avoid this DVD version, it's not worth it!",1158883200,5,393,3.9873417721518987
2301911,5,B0009NCPPQ,"..but DO buy this if you're looking for a GREAT comedy! Horrible acting! Horrible plot! Horrible quality! But HILARIOUS movie! But how can this be you ask?

Even though the acting is horrible, there are some classic lines from this movie that really set it off! Before this guy kills, he ALWAYS has something to say. Always. This just makes the deaths even more funny! And even though each death is cut away from, the cheesiness of this movie is what makes it so great!

Instant classic in my opinion. Buy it if your looking for a good time with your friends! Great for parties!",1153267200,5,578,4.495238095238095
2301912,2,B0009NCPPQ,"Rob the Grob is right! I remember seeing the 85 minute unrated version of this when I was younger and it contains BUCKETS more gore than the 80 minute R rated version. The R rated version has so much of the violence and gore eliminated that there is basically no reason to watch it.

Like the scene where Bobby Ray stabs Gus the security guard in the eye.... you don't even see the pencil penetrate the eye in the ""R"" version!! This is total B.S. -- Rob was right... If you are going to take the time to release ""Psycho Cop Returns"" on DVD, shouldn't you release the best version available?!?! Fans of this genre want to see the maximum amount of carnage and nudity, not this stripped-down garbage!!!",1127433600,13,700,4.426356589147287
2301913,1,B0009NCPPQ,Even though it states apprx. 85 minutes it is actually the edited R rated 80 minute version. Why even release it?? what losers!!!!,1126224000,9,130,4.695652173913044
8063465,5,B0009NCPPQ,"Great movie at a great price. The Blu Ray transfer looks amazing. It's so funny how this movie is far more popular than part 1 which doesn't even have a Blu Ray release. My only complaint if any,  was that I wish it had different artwork from BR to DVD. Other than that,  terrific !!",1522800000,,283,4.127272727272727

8063467,5,B0009NCPPQ,"Who likes their exploitation trashy side up? I do! You do! We do! Some do! Yeah, it's okay to be noncommital to anything that I'm reviewing, because ""trashy side up"", what does that even mean, right? Let me think about it for a momentoh, okay, I got it. Don't...wait! Don't go away! This is important.

This movie is a ton of fun. I had never heard of it before but wanted to see it just by reading the concept alone, and let me tell you, after watching this new tricked-out edition by the purveyors of bad taste in luxury editions at Vinegar Syndrome, I devoured all the extras and watched the film again with the running commentary by director Adam Rifkin (who is not only entertaining but informative and humble even).

This movie was done on a low budget, and ""trashy side up"" means that it's tongue must've had a razor in it, because it gets pushed right through it's cheek. There's ample humor, but also enough of a plot that does not take itself seriously in the least. Julie Strain and her friends take choreographed dance routines to new heights and that cannot be a bad thing.

The real revelation (not to take away anything from any of the other actors, because everyone is good in this and made me want to party all night long with each and every one of them and I'm too old for that sort of thing) for me was Miles Dougal, who, it turns out was a childhood friend of the director and is capable of and brings some brilliant and unique over-the-top acting chops. Based on this movie alone, he should be at least as well known as Bruce Campbell.

By now you should know if you need want desire to own this DVD/Bluray combo set. As with all Vinegar Syndrome's output, there are optional English subtitles, and who does that for movies of this caliber anymore, if ever? The fun is waiting to be had.",1511568000,,1808,4.404191616766467
8063468,5,B0009NCPPQ,"This could very well be one of THE greatest movies ever made! Its right up there with Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption and The Toxic Avenger! This film has it all: Boobs, Booze, ballin music, Blood and bad one-liners! Joe Vicker is a satan-worshipping cop on a killing spree to rid the world of crime, bachelor parties and over-hours and hes the best at what he does. You have the right to remain DEAD!",1509321600,,408,4.527027027027027
8063469,4,B0009NCPPQ,Very Entertaining B Movie. Finally the uncut release is available once again!,1504137600,,77,5.5
8063470,3,B0009NCPPQ,"There is a large group of movies made that are considered so bad they're good. I know, it doesnt make sense when you read that does it? But the fact is they are enjoyable on some level even though there are mistakes, bad acting, bad lighting, bad cinematography and more wrong with them. Some are intentional, others are not. In the case of PSYCHO COP RETURNS Im not quite sure which that is.

Having not seen PSCHO COP I had no idea what to expect here. It doesnt matter as far as I can see. The movie kicks off with a group of office workers planning a bachelor party after hours in their workplace. As two of them walk down the street discussing plans they make the mistake of doing so in front of Officer Joe Vickers. Hearing them discussing drugs he gives them the once over and lets them go. But the truth is he only let them go to get a better idea of where they were heading and with plans on making sure they paid for breaking the law.

Night falls, the office closes and the party begins. Strippers are brought in and quickly disrobe while the guys hoot and holler. Drugs are off the menu as the guy carrying them dumped them before Vickers approached them but alcohol is pouring freely. As all of this goes on there are more people left in the office building. One is a female exec working on a project, the other is a couple working on each other. Yes, believe it or not, they're fooling around in the office.

Vickers enters the building and confronts the security guard and then kills him. Doors locked, elevators in his control, he heads upstairs to take care of the lawbreakers he overheard earlier. What they didn't realize in their fear of a law enforcement officer is that he isn't a standard issue policeman. The truth he is an undead Satanist with psychotic tendencies. In other words, hes evil and like to kill people. This is what he does for the next hour or so.

The movie is a flashback to the films of the time with the body count rising and the gruesome methods of their demise being as creative as the ratings code would allow at the time. The gore is there, the screams are there and the chase sequences are there. And so is what was probably intended to be another franchise in the form of Office Vickers. Poor puns and bright red blood flow freely here but weren't enough to make movie fans embrace the two films. At least at the time.

Instead the films developed a cult type following with fans running VHS copies of the movie until they wore out. A DVD release of the film in 2005 came out but had much of the violence and sexual content removed. Now Vinegar Syndrome has brought out a fantastic version of the film with a blu-ray print that is as clean as you're going to get.

Their version contains plenty of extras as well, something movies like this rarely receive. Included are:
A commentary track with Director Adam Rifkin; ""Habeas Corpus"" - a 43 minute documentary on the making of PSYCHO COP RETURNS, featuring brand new interviews with: Adam Rifkin (Director), Robert R. Shafer (Lead Actor), Dan Povenmire (Screenwriter), Peter Schink (Editor), Miles Dougal (Co-Star), Rod Sweitzer (Co-Star), Nick Vallelonga (Co-Star), Barbara Niven (Co-Star) and Melanie Good (Co-Star); ""The Victims of Vickers"" - featurette with SFX Artist Mike Tristano; cover artwork by Chris Garofalo; and reversible cover artwork. Not bad for a 20 some year old movie.

One interesting thing to note is that the director is a pseudonym for Adam Rifkin, the director of such films as THE DARK BACKWARD, THE CHASE and DETROIT ROCK CITY as well as having written SMALL SOLDIERS, MOUSEHUNT and ZOOM. He made the film as a learning process and to have fun while making the film. The end result is one that while not a fantastic movie is one of those fun slasher pics from the 80s/90s that is a must see for fans of the genre as well as a great drinking film for those who imbibe. Cheers to Vinegar Syndrome for keeping this one from doing little more than collecting dust.",1501200000,,3985,4.51872399445215
8063471,4,B0009NCPPQ,"I almost passed on this....""Psycho Cop""..? Sounded like a 3rd rate Maniac Cop rip off to me... Well, it isn't. I'm so glad I checked my assumptions at the door and took a chance on this as its pure, unadulterated schlocky fun and it rocks. Leave it to those mad geniuses at Vinegar Syndrome to fully restore this and bring it back from the grave of obscurity for the masses. Though made in the early 90's this is totally in the spirit of the 80's slashers and other related genre films from that decade of horror-movie decadence. It's also pretty darn funny which definitely adds to its entertainment value. Truly, this was a lot of fun and I think it will lend itself to repeat viewings unlike so much of what passes for genre movies these days. And of course, having Julie Strain in it doesn't hurt one little bit either!",1494547200,,823,4.456953642384106
8063472,5,B0009NCPPQ,"I love it. I remember watching this on Rhonda Shear's ""Up All Night"" show back years ago. I also caught it on HBO a time or two.

Sadly, the DVD release this film got was butchered in order to remove the the gore. Why could the gore out of a slasher film? It's like taking the shooting out of action films. Why do it?

Anyway, the film itself is like a mix of Die Hard, Maniac Cop and Bachelor Party all rolled into one. Most of the action takes place in an L.A. High rise due to the extremely small budget. But, hey... it works...

The acting is bad, but Robert R. Shafer as crazy cop Joe Vickers sure does his best to make the one liners amusing. Honestly, this is the kind of slasher that you watch with friends on Saturday night with a case of beers near by. The nudity doesn't hurt as all the women in the film are attractive. And despite the movie having been made in 1993, it is very late 80's in spirit with the big haired women and the location and all.

It just is a lot of fun.",1493769600,3,988,4.025510204081633
8063473,5,B0009NCPPQ,"I remember seeing this on Cinemax forever ago.  I loved Psycho Cop 2 then, and I love it even more now.  The transfer is crisp.  All the gore is there in its uncut glory.  The extras really celebrate this butchered at the editor's room film.  I'm so happy it's now fully uncut.

The audio commentary is enjoyable and full of production stories.  The making of feature is also very fun.

This movie is awesome, end of story.  For fans of this genre, buy it already.  Jeez.",1493596800,2,471,4.372093023255814
8063474,5,B0009NCPPQ,"Absolutely awesome to FINALLY have released the UNCUT  Version of the film the way it was meant to be seen with all the sex, gore, an 80s style classic kills. This uncut  Version should've been the only version released.",1493164800,6,220,4.615384615384615
