8655528,5,B003TYCT44,I received the dvd in good condition! Not only that but the seller added a free dvd gift. The English subs are hard to understand but I didn't need the subs since I already know enough Japanese to understand what was happening. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase!,1341187200,,267,4.583333333333333
