Gang war with the upstart Johnny Caspar (John Polito) ensues because Leo won't bump A dodgy bookie.  Leo's enamored with the lovely Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the bookie's sister.  But Verna is also seeing tom on the sly. Messy.
The Coen Brothers have made a period piece gangster movie (the 30s) and have great joy with twisting the tale and playing with the tropes and the language. Basically they've mashed up Dashiel Hammet's Red Harvest and The Glass Key to make a wonderful movie that I watch at least once a year.  If you don't like this movie, you can take your flunky and dangle.",1503619200,,691,4.59349593495935

8023799,3,B00028HCLU,"MILLER'S CROSSING (1990), is a professional,  dark gangster tale,
with a convoluted story. The viewers' minds will be spinning from
the over-worked script. There is also an excess of psychologically
and emotioanlly numbing elements from the frequent violence.

The story's goal is to keep everyone on the edge of their seats
over the length of the feature, from the events.

There is also an effort in conveying street jargon and expressions
every 3 minutes throughout, with stylish intentions, such as
schmatte, high hat, mopin around,  prickly pear, schnook, sheeny,
square G, sqwauk, daffy, rumpus, roscoe, twist, put the finger on,
yeg, Katzenjammer, gargle, take it on the head and toe, jawing,
etc.

The filming is fine, with an extra emphasis and notable mention for
the special effects, particularly the machine gunfire occurring
over several scenes that is spectacular, (albeit unrealistic as a
magazine or charger doesn't empty for 3 minutes of continuous
fire.)

Gabriel Byrne, as  Tom,  and Albert Finney, as Leo play 2
Machevellian leaders and all-powerful individuals, mainly from
their skill in setting up mind games, houses of mirrors, strategic
thoughts that are laid out in front of the town's and gang's
members, whom they manipulate for their own purposes. This is done
consistently ruthlessly  and lethally. It is mainly Tom, a
compulsive gambler, who generates income from those intrigues and
manipulations of people, allegiances, and groups, the other
beneficiary being Leo who is a political figure in need of keeping
the population controlled and obedient.

Marcia Harden, as Verna, has the youth, looks, and sensual presence
here necessary to credibly lay claim to constantly being a draw of
the attention of admirers from all areas.

Jon Polito, as Caspar, albeit a gang leader, demonstrably has a
conscience and a sense of ethics, perhaps to his detriment.

Finally, the remarkable actor is John Turturro, as Bernie, at the
summit of his craft, with a stunning representation of being driven
to  a woodland to be a a victim of a hit.

The story is situated in the underground, ranging from gambling,
bookies, fixed boxing and horse competitions, police being
complicit by looking the other way in return for compensation,
collectors of ileagle debts with violent physical beatings and
tactics.

Obviously, there is a fear of being double -crossed, lied to, setup
as a mark by conspirators, coupled with plenty of point-blank
rubouts and hits, as well as  special effects conveyign well the
horror of those story.",1231113600,,2540,5.203931203931204
8023800,5,B00028HCLU,"This is a different kind of gangster flick. It is an intelligent foray into the world of the roaring twenties and the corruption and speakeasies engendered by Prohibition. This money making turf is zealously guarded by rival crime bosses: Leo, masterfully played by Albert Finney, and Johnny Caspar, well played by Jon Polito.

Tom Reagan, beautiful played by the darkly smoldering Gabriel Byrne, is Leo's main man. Unfortunately for him, he is feeling the noose around his neck tighten, as he owes some big gambling debts that he is unable to pay. Moreover, he is head over heels in love with Verna, played with hard edged, sexual intensity by Marcia Gay Harden, who just happens to be Leo's main squeeze. Moreover, Verna's bookmaker brother, Bernie Bernbaum, played with smarmy abandon by John Turturro, has a contract on his life and is on the run. When Tom finds himself helping Bernie, he soon discovers that no good deed goes unpunished. All this makes life very complicated and difficult for Tom.

At times, it is difficult to ascertain who the good guys and the bad guys really are, or for whom they really work, as they all seem to march to the beat of a different drummer. There is more to what is going on than initially meets the eye. Make no mistake, this is a multi-faceted movie that works well on many levels. As with all Coen brothers' films, there is an underlay of sly humor that permeates the film.

The dialogue is sharp and evocative of another time, as it is laden with Prohibition era slang, and its stacatto delivery is most effective. The characters all walk the walk and talk the talk. The performances by the entire cast are stellar. Look for Steve Buscemi in the small role of Mink, and do not blink or you will miss Frances McDormand's performance as Johnny Caspar's secretary. All in all, this is an excellent film and another feather in the collective cap of the Coen brothers.",1148860800,,1909,4.692537313432836
