1050771,5,6305513384,"Great British humour at it's best that relates to real life. About a chilly dentist named Bob and his bubbly cheropitist wife Margaret. It refers to about getting older, having kids, losing weight, sex and lots of  conflicts that affect everyday couples.",946252800,5,254,5.0476190476190474

7891945,5,6305513384,We still have a VHS player so these worked great.  My wife really enjoyed these shows.  They came just as advertised.  In fact she asked me if more are available so she could continue to watch new ones.,1383004800,,202,4.2631578947368425
7891946,5,6305513384,I waited almost 20 years to find this after going to  Europe. I enjoyed this very much I think of my parents and alot of tv show greats to be married and live like this. I have been married 7 times. I got lucky. This show should be on DVD. Get it and laugh you a@! Off!! E.b,1361145600,,274,3.7241379310344827

7891948,5,6305513384,"I have missed seeing this animated program on TV, and had to add it to my library.  If you like British humor, animation and adult content, this is for you.",1261353600,,156,4.2
7891949,5,6305513384,"I majored in animation in school but fell initially fell in love with B&M while watching Comedy Central. Great show. I wish I had the money to get the newer seasons though.

Side note, the creators of the series are really nice and actually respond to emails!",1257033600,,259,4.51063829787234
7891950,5,6305513384,Funny show.  I missed it when Comedy Central cancelled it.  The tapes are of great quality.,1232236800,,91,4.625
7891951,5,6305513384,"Bob and Margaret is the best animated series I have ever seen,these two are so real,and go throught the same ups and downs and life experiences and annoyances as real life couples. My husband and I are just like them with our pets,and our love for take out and everything. Its a really funny show that anyone can relate to and I really hope they bring out new episodes to tape or dvd soon,I already own the two video collections out now. Comedy Central should also show it again,I don't think they realized just how big the shows following was. Also the show and Bob and Margaret the characters are now based in Canada and that's why the show is not on in the U.S. anymore just to let you know. But maybe they will at least put season 2 and 3 on tape someday.",1001808000,4,759,4.241379310344827
7891952,5,6305513384,"i like the show very much, its a very interesting  program,  i liked the episode where bob's cousins pop in and ruin most of the couples romatic  gateway, and the glass argument was interesting!",967334400,,194,4.647058823529412
7891953,5,6305513384,"Bob and Margaret are the perfect couple, and are loads of fun to watch. I  love them muchly and I am never ceased to be amazed at how accurate they  are. The best two would probably be Blood Sweat and Tears and Friends for  Dinner. The other ones are great too. This is the answer to Seinfeld.",962755200,,293,4.105263157894737
