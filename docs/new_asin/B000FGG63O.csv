2565269,1,B000FGG63O,"I bought this film for use in my social studies classes.  The film had more to do with the producer visiting modern mexico, riding around in taxis and trains, eating mexican foods, talking to modern people, etc  than with Spanish Conquistadors.  This film was really hard to follow for students and many came away saying ""what did that have to do with Cortez?""  I expected something on the order of ""500 Nations"" or something that would interest young learners and am really suprised that PBS released this quality of documetary.  It was more like a travel film or something like that.  The viewer walks away from this thinking ""huh?""",1243555200,13,634,4.770642201834862
2565270,3,B000FGG63O,"I was DEEPLY disappointed by this effort by one of the best history
presenters out there. His seminal work, ""Trojan War"" opened whole
doors for me and is a superb production on almost every level even
if it is somewhat dated by today's standards.

But ""Conquistadors"" was quite another matter and one need only look
at the contents page of the book to see why. Whereas the book was SIX
chapters long, the video is only FOUR parts. Painfully for me, Wood
chose to leave out almost any mention of the Journey of Cabeza de Vaca
from the video although it is the final chapter of his book. The tale
of de Vaca is perhaps the most fantastic of the Conquistador Tales if
only for its' tragedy and futility. And these qualities are matched by
the sacrifice and determination of those same adventurers.

More to the point, it is THE classic tale of the search for the ""Seven
Cities of Gold"" that is the culmination of the Conquistador Era.
Instead, Wood choses to conclude with a meandering tale of lost men in
the Amazon Basin that while it is heroic it is also distant from any
of the previous tales as can be. The longer Wood worked his way down-
river the more I was reminded of his early effort in the old ""Great
Rail Journeys"" PBS/BBC series where he beautifully summed up the
ravages of Colonialism whilst retracing the ruined remains of the old
Congo Railway.

That interpretation of the Congo Railway was a brilliant re-tracing,
this video is just plain up the creek without a paddle. A rental, maybe.
No way a purchase. Borrow the book from the library if you like and
then if you like what you read come back here and look for reprints of
the original histories Wood drew from. Those ARE worth your time indeed.",1235174400,14,1714,4.487179487179487
2565271,4,B000FGG63O,"I was looking forward to watching this series after having seen Mr Wood's history of India series on PBS.

It is very informative, well made and would be a 5 star product if it were not for the fact that it's advertised as 1.85:1 (wide screen in my books) but is actually a scaled down to 4:3 wide screen.

My TV is able to zoom in, so I can compensate, but the picture quality is not what I'd been looking forward too. Hence 4 stars.

Other than that a great documentary.",1232236800,7,472,4.164835164835165
2565272,5,B000FGG63O,"Whether it shows a lot of actors in costume or not isn't really the point.  He takes you through areas as a tour guide and tells you the history.  The last part about De Vacca and his revelations and the extraordinary journey was fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed this just as much as I do Ken Burns' documentaries, it is a different style.  I don't want to see everyone do things the same way.  As far as him showing art, he did show art, he also showed you by trying many things how these people survived, what they ate, how they cooked, how they made plows, how the Aztecs made weapons that were inferior to the steel ones the Spaniards came equipped with.  Also, the journey of the Incas leaving their beautiful land to try and put separation between themselves and the conquistadors was heartbreaking.  I very much enjoyed it and will look forward to more of Michael Wood's exuberant storytelling.",1210204800,29,901,4.59375
2565273,3,B000FGG63O,"From the comments made by some reviewing this series, I can see that they are not practicing historians. Most modern historians understand the biases of especially contemporary and nineteenth century writers. It is interesting that they would question the presentation of modern research and not those of the past. That said, this presentation is a modern interpretation of the period of Spanish conquest. The one point that it shows better than most interpretations is the role that Native peoples played in the conquest of the Americas. Used in a classroom, the series is a good place to initiate conversations on cultural misunderstanding and conflict as well as the events portrayed.",1189555200,11,687,5.254545454545455
2565274,5,B000FGG63O,"Some of the other reviewers have complained that this series doesn't match with the ""classic"" history authors on the subject. It's my opinion that this view fails to recognize how Michael Wood's documentaries usually operate. His research often has a revisionist ethic, and if you observe the credits and his interviews, many of his sources are often current versus classic experts, and he also goes out of his way, especially in this series, to get folk and indigenous perspectives.

This is in line with his general humanist approach. I for one enjoy it, and while he interprets facts with a an eye for revision or ""what ifs"" or ""just maybe,"" he never abuses the subject. In fact, he takes us on a journey to question everything we might know or think we know from reading canonical texts.

This particular series is also beautifully shot and taken as a whole is a fresh educational and entertainment experience for those who know little about the Conquistadors and their importance to world history.",1184284800,61,1002,4.8882352941176475
2565275,1,B000FGG63O,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSSED TO BE ABOUT THE CONQUISTADORS. I THINK THE HOST HAS AN EGO PROBLEM. HE SHOULD WATCH SOME OF THE KEN BURNS SHOWS SO HE WILL KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD SHOW. MANY TIMES THEY MAKE YOU WATCH THE HOST WALKING OR SHOW HIS BACK OR CLOSE UP SHOTS OF HIS FACE. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SHOWING IS RUINS,PAINTINGS FROM MUSEUMS, ACTORS IN COSTUMES ETC...  I DID NOT WANT TO SEE A BUNCH OF GLAMORE SHOTS OF SOME GUY. THAT BEING SAID: SOME OF THE THINGS SHOWN ARE GOOD. THEY DO SHOW SOME RUINS ETC...  BUT, THEY KEEP GOING BACK TO THE  GLAMORE SHOTS OF THE HOST.  ALSO, SOME OF THE SCENES ARE OUT OF PLACE. WHEN DISCUSSING THE TIME CORTEZ DESTROYED HIS SHIPS SO HIS SOLDIERS COULDEN'T LEAVE THEY SHOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DRAGGING A MOTOR BOAT ON SHORE, WHEN DISCUSSING HIS MARCH INLAND THEY SHOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RIDING ON A BUS. THE INFORMATION DELIVERED VERBALLY IS GOOD. BUT, THEY COMPLETELY DESTROY THE MOOD FREQUENTLY WITH THE PRESENTATION.",1172793600,17,952,4.361581920903955
2565276,3,B000FGG63O,This is an entertaining review of the exploits of the Spanish conquistadors in the New World -- it skims over their various adventures with the advantage of letting us see the places where they actually occurred as they are today.,1172361600,9,230,4.775

2565282,3,B000FGG63O,"Presents geographical and historical details, showing modern day re-creations of routes that Cortez and other Spanish explorers took.  Elicits critical thinking about motivations of these first European explorers: Finding gold and amassing power for their King & Pope.  Shows problems to be overcome by invaders: lack of language skills with locals, poor weather, low food, battles for authority, and being isolated from their homeland.  Amazing that these unprepared explorers were able to conquer all in their paths, largely from advantages of having horses and guns. Wealth from silver and gold was brought back eventually to Spain, with the volunteer explorers being well rewarded.  The episode format allows time to take notes and discuss key events.  Warning:  Some mature language, such as discussing human sacrifice rituals and Spanish troops' womanizing.",1363392000,2,863,5.651162790697675
2565283,5,B000FGG63O,"If you enjoy factual educational documentaries, then this is the DVD set for you. It gives a very good historical overview of the Conquistadors and their lasting legacy to the peoples they conquered. They also did some good by introducing the people to Christianity. There were abuses of course, that can't be denied, but I found it very interesting all the same and Michael Wood is a good presenter, making history available to everyone.",1361577600,5,438,4.9324324324324325
2565284,5,B000FGG63O,"I teach world languages and my students recently watched the Fall of the Aztecs. My students commented on how interesting this documentary was. They said they get tired of looking at the DVDs with typical historians just showing pictures of things and talking about them.  They enjoyed visiting the locations and getting the history along with it. I also enjoyed seeing a historian that doesn't repeat the glorified history but instead, gives the indigenous side. These lands weren't ""discovered."" People were already living there.",1354838400,9,531,5.321428571428571
2565285,5,B000FGG63O,"Conquistadors is must see, it does not shy on revealing what actually happened as best as any modern man could.",1315958400,,111,4.6
2565286,5,B000FGG63O,"Your own personally guided tour through a sweeping historical narrative.  The author takes you over the same paths, roads, jungles and rivers as the Conquistadors traveled.  The photography is OUTSTANDING.  It adds to the feeling of being there.  You can still see remnants of old cities and roads built from stone.  You visit the same native peoples as existed in the 1500's.  All of this adds to the depth of the story.

I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  It is another fine PBS production.",1264204800,7,505,4.724137931034483
8122372,5,B000FGG63O,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Wood and this story of Spain's conquest of Mexico, Central and South America is dramatically played out.  What a history lesson for us all!",1508803200,,165,4.5
8122373,4,B000FGG63O,Super irritating host but spectacular scenery.  It is good to see the most important sites.,1506816000,,91,5.066666666666666
8122374,4,B000FGG63O,"I saw this on PBS and didn't see but three of the four episodes (I missed the third one, the gold expeditions). Overall, I enjoyed the series, especially the Cabeza de Vaca episode, whose story I read as a child. I also appreciated Wood's enthusiasm, but sometimes he seemed very naive and appeared to believe anything the locals told him. A little more questioning would've been good, before accepting some pretty shaky evidence as fact.",1506124800,,438,4.8533333333333335
8122375,5,B000FGG63O,Very good program though he does leave out (even large) portions of the stories likely for time. He's very good at connecting the halves of the story in a way that doesn't feel contrived or seem like entire large battles are missing. Essentially this program is a starting point for anyone wanting to go deeper learning about Conquistadors and the full written stories are too incredible to seem true.,1502928000,,401,4.826086956521739
8122376,4,B000FGG63O,"Lacking in details Could have been better like the other 1492,with some more details about the Spanish forceful rape of an older civilization.",1501804800,,142,5.217391304347826
8122377,2,B000FGG63O,"Pretty much like watching some guy tell a story, in fact, thats really all it is. He's a good story teller, and pretty enthusiastic, but aside from some modern views of the areas, you might as well listen to an audio.",1500508800,,217,4.317073170731708
8122378,2,B000FGG63O,"This video was far too short on detail and historic imagery.  Nearly all imagery was like a travel channel show on present-day central and south America.  I'm not interested in watching some guy traveling in cars, trains and motorized boats through modern landscapes.",1497657600,2,267,5.186046511627907
8122379,5,B000FGG63O,excellent documentary. totally met my expectations.,1488499200,,51,7.666666666666667
8122380,5,B000FGG63O,"Michael Wood is a genius story teller.  I own all of his programs from his Trojan War epic all the way up to The Story of India.  Conquistadors covers four chapters from the history of the Americas - the conquest of the Aztecs, the fall of the Incas, the search for El Dorado and the journey of Cabeza de Vaca.  Michael Wood's blending of modern visuals along with his expert knowledge of history create an incredibly entertaining and informative documentary.  You can't go wrong with this DVD.",1473033600,5,494,4.64367816091954
8122381,4,B000FGG63O,I really liked Michael Woods' presentation. My only regret is that I cannot play it on our Blue-ray machine,1462406400,,107,4.684210526315789
