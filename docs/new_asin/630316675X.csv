582456,3,630316675X,"Dark Angel: The Ascent is about a demonness from hell named Veronica who wishes to explore the world above.  Born and raised in hell, she has never experienced the pleasures of life on earth.  Against her father's wishes, she makes ""The Ascent"" to earth and finds herself naked in a dark alleyway.  She soon gets hit by a car and finds herself in the hospital to be tended to by a doctor named Max.  Max brings Veronica into his home and Veronica, by watching local news on T.V. realizes earth is filled with evildoers.  Soon, Veronica goes on a murderous vigilante rampage to rid the city of scum, including the town's crooked mayor.
Another decent release by Full Moon, the studio that put out a plethora of quality straight-to-vid B-movie horror in the 90's.  The budget here is limited but it is exactly this that helps lend the film its atmospheric and surreal feeling.  Many scenes like those in hell, in dark alleyways, in graveyards are dark and chilling even though they often look too much like a set.  It's a bit of a hard film to categorize, starts off with many elements of the fantastic while they're in hell, then switches to a gory horror film and towards the end in the last 1/3 of the film becomes a hokey love story that puts aside its horror elements completely. This is certainly not a film that takes itself seriously and capitalizes on this with an injection of clever humour and intentional puns.
Dark Angel does fall prey to its low-budget trappings eventually though.  For one, isn't it odd that the city they're in is obviously Eurpopean in its architecture and style (it's actually filmed in Romania) yet all the actors have American accents?  And strangely, the acting is actually decent except that is, for the title character, played by Angela Featherstone.  You see, her looks are perfect for the role; shoulder-length red hair, blue eyes, clear skin, and a hypnotic gaze.  Whenever she opens her mouth however it becomes absolutely painful.  I understand that being from hell and not accustomed to earth she was expected to act robotically to a certain extent but that is not an excuse for her wretched performance in this film.  If you want an example of this being well done then look no further than Natasha Henstridge in ""Species"", Featherstone's performance however is a disaster.  I'm surprised she got any other film roles after this.  Still recommended overall, it's a flawed film that certainly has many b-movie charms and interesting ideas.",1090108800,11,2483,4.779859484777518
582457,5,630316675X,"Dark Angel was produced in 1994 by Full Moon Entertainment, a low budget horror house. I love this movie. Full Moon does a fair amount of crap, but sometimes - like this one - the lack of a serious budget forces the filmmakers to be really ingenious in compensation, and they turn out some surprisingly affecting work.

Dark Angel, subtitled The Ascent, stars Angela Featherstone. In case you're not familiar with the name, you might have seen her as Jess, Ben Stiller's girlfriend in The Zero Effect, or Nikki, the punked-out lesbian all over Eliza Dushku (and who can blame her?) in Soul Survivors. Probably best know as Chloe the ""Xerox girl"" who got between Ross and Rachel on Friends.

In Dark Angel, Angela plays Veronica, a teenaged demon from Hell who's always wondered about the world above. Her father is one of Hell's most fearsome torturers, and so impatient with her curiosity - demons have been forbidden by Heaven to ascend into the ""real world"" - that in a fit of rage he tries to kill her. She flees, ascends, and finds herself on the streets of a modern American city.

There are so many things to like about this movie. The view of Hell, and the demons' relationship to God and Heaven, is fascinating. The demons don't see themselves as being in opposition to Heaven, they have crosses in their rooms and worship God. Angels from Heaven visit Hell to give them orders. They have their place in God's plan, and their mission is to punish sinners.

And that's what Veronica, like any good demon, does in the world above. In one incredible scene she comes upon two police officers doing a Rodney King style beating on a black man. (Only, unlike Rodney King, this guy didn't have it coming, he was just some innocent guy out walking around.) The conversation between Veronica and one of the officers goes something like this:

""There's nothing to see here, miss. Just move along.""

""And allow you to continue to abuse this man?""

""How would you like to spend the night in jail on a prostitution charge?""

""How would you like to die in a state of mortal sin?""

Veronica kills them both. She's a serial killer, her victims the sinners of the city, offed in various gory fashions. The sort of stuff that makes front page news. This, of course, attracts the attentions of the police. Two good cops, interviewing local residents in the course of their investigation, question Veronica. It goes something like this:

""We're just questioning everyone in the neighborhood. There were a couple of murders that occurred last night...""

""Good.""

""What do you mean, 'good?' We're talking about men being murdered.""

""How do you know they were not sinners?""

""These men were ripped apart. No one deserves to die like that.""

""You have no idea how ugly sin is in the eyes of God.""

What makes this scene simultaneously hilarious and creepy as hell (pun intended) is the reaction of the cops and the total calm certainty in Veronica's voice. Because while she sounds like the Son of Sam killer and the cops are looking at each other, thinking dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo, we know she's speaking the absolute literal truth. When Vernoica says these men died because sin is ugly in the eyes of God, she KNOWS.

And yet, for all this, Dark Angel is, at its core, a really sweet love story. I kid you not. There are moments in this film that are just beautiful, both visually and emotionally.

Angela Featherstone in the role of Veronica is the linchpin of the movie, and she carries it off wonderfully. Her normally blond hair is dyed red for this role. Combined with her pale skin and blue eyes, she's amazingly striking. Her eyes are so blue - and I have no idea if this was accomplished with contact lenses or it's her natural eye color - they really play that up in the movie. When Veronica is feeling angry or amorous, with absolutely no special effects other than expert lighting, her blue eyes seem to glow.

I give this movie my highest recommendation. If you have any liking at all for the genre, you will love it.",1066608000,23,4024,4.65819209039548
582458,5,630316675X,"Life is hell for Veronica Iscariot. Unlike her underworld brethren, the sultry demon takes no pleasure in tormenting the eternally damned. However when Veronica leaves Hell in search of salvation, things take an evil turn. The land of the living is polluted with corruption, and the self-righteous she-demon feels compelled to put things right.
Along with her bloodthirsty hound Hellraiser, Veronica delivers powerful retribution, unceremoniously tearing the wicked and the unforgiven limb from limb.

582601,4,630316675X,"I found this demon girl B-movie strangely affecting. I know, right?  Made on a shoestring budget, shot in Romania, loaded with sometimes cheesy special effects, uneven acting and an impossibly earnest screenplay, this Full Moon production rates as surprisingly good entertainment.  Much of its charm comes from Angela Featherstone's performance.

Some Amazon reviewers have criticized her acting in this film as wooden and stilted but given Featherstone's background and training as an actress (which is extensive) it is certain she played it that way deliberately, and it works (for me, anyway).  There is a scene later in the movie where demon girl Veronica is off to mete out infernal justice and says goodbye to her sleeping lover.  Seems to me Angela Featherstone had been working up to that moment all movie long, to the point at which her character could fully emote.  I felt genuinely touched by the gentle tone of her voice, the lingering look she gave him.  So no, I saw nothing second-rate about her performance.  Besides, it was Full Moon, notorious for its one-shot takes.  Actors working under those constraints don't get a second chance at the scene.

How can you fault a movie in which demons are named Veronica? Where bad guys have their spines removed?  Where demon girlfriends new to humanity innocently recite porn movie dialogue as a way to move the romance along?  This little film definitely had its moments. Strongly recommended. Too bad Full Moon didn't make a sequel.",1478217600,7,1493,5.024390243902439

In hell Veronica has horns, big feet, wings, pointy ears, a tail, and a small pox vaccination scar on her arm, because God knows we don't want any disfigured dark angels.

The hell scene was fairly decent for a low budget film, except for the dinner table scene which seemed a bit odd. Veronica has a hard time adapting to our world, akin to a ""Fifth Element"" type of thing and acts extremely odd when her mannerisms appeared normal in hell. Her speech suddenly went odd as she says, ""Accept me into your dwelling."" I like the fact that her mother was named Teresa. Don't think about it too hard.

The film was low budget and had low budget effects such as the red eye, etc, but to their credit they never used that demonic voice enhancer.

A good low budget film. Soft 4 stars.

582919,4,630316675X,"Director Linda Hassani and writer/producer Charles Band (the Puppet Master, Subspecies, Ghoulies and Trancers franchises) bring us a ""more"" serious release with one of the most coherent and interesting plots Full Moon has ever produced.  Heaven and Hell, demons and angels are presented in a very different way in this under-recognized gem.

Both young demonesses, Mary shows Veronica (Angela Featherstone; Soul Survivors, Army of Darkness) an unguarded gateway from the pit of Hell to the world of mortals above.  After a disagreement with her infernal professor and then her disapproving demon father, she runs away to ""ascend"" to Earth like a rebellious misunderstood teenager to find herself naked (without her horns, claws and wings) on the city streets...shortly after which she is hit by a car.

In the hospital ICU she meets Max, a young doctor who is ""pure of heart"" as Veronica puts it.  Then, as would a sultry vampire, she uses her other-worldly charm to compel Max to bring her home with him.  Just like Leeloo in The Fifth Element (1997), our red-headed Hell-spawn learns about mankind by watching the news and, like Leeloo, Veronica was VERY disappointed with what she saw.  She decides to serve as vigilante judge, jury and executioner to evil-doers, feeding their entrails to her Hell-spawned dog Hellraiser and even preparing them as ""secret recipes"" for dinner and serving them to her handsome host Max.

When the story began, Veronica fled Hell rebelling against her parents and teachers by not wanting to punish the eternally damned for their sins.  But Veronica learns that evil abounds on Earth and that many do indeed deserve such harsh punishments for their actions.  Although she doesn't acknowledge it, it seems that her parents and teachers really did have her best interest in mind.  After all, she's now doing to sinners in life what her elders wanted her to do to sinners in the afterlife.  But that's just one aspect of the movie...

So, a demon (or ""dark angel"") wishes to visit Earth in human skin to share its experiences, find love and punish evil-doers to protect the pure-hearted souls.  This story may feel a lot like City of Angels (1998) meets The Prophecy (1995) with a dash of Leeloo Dallas and a sprig of Species (1995; in terms of her appropriately aggressive sexuality and when Henstridge almost robotically emotes to human situations), but this movie actually predates all of them!  So what at first felt like a series of rip-offs and borrowed concepts was, well, much more original than I thought...by a lot.

The budget is low (as you should have expected), but stretched as far as possible when it comes to the gore.  Veronica frequently unceremoniously rends her victims and reaches inside to remove organs or the occasional spinal cord.  Full Moon did a fine job of bringing the fun gore we know them for, but also successfully delivered an interesting story (which they're definitely NOT known for).

It would have been a better movie with a higher body count but she had to take time for a little romance with a doctor (Daniel Markel).

583030,4,630316675X,"I saw this feature on DVD.  It's from Full Moon Entertainment, who brought us the cult classic Puppet Master series.  It's low-budget and shows it, but benefits from a more original script than you typically see in low-budget films.

For one thing, the title character is Veronica, a demoness from Hell with big feet (this is actually relevant in the film), but not the kind of Hell we would expect.  The demons in Hell torture the damned, not out of evil motives or simple sadism, but because it's their appointed task to inflict divinely ordained punishment on the wicked.  It's God's will, and everyone in Hell believes in God.  We even see demons say grace before eating supper.

Veronica, however, is curious about life on Earth and decides to visit there, even though it's forbidden for her kind.  Assuming a more human form, she meets with a common accident and then meets a doctor to whom she is attracted.  Exploring the new world around her, she sees wickedness and corruption and can't help but confront and punish it, endowed as she is with an absolute moral clarity.

The director is a woman, and I believe that it shows.  She obviously cares about the characters and treats Veronica sympathetically.  She also keeps gore and nudity to a minimum.  The story is obviously more important than gratuitous violence or special effects.

At heart, this is the tale of a stranger in a strange land and a love story to boot.

I did have a few gripes.  First, I thought the pacing was too slow.  Second, I thought Angela Featherstone's acting was too deadpan and robotic at times.  She should have shown a greater range and depth of emotion.

Still, I liked the film, overall.  I hope someone remakes it with a bigger budget and more talent.",1371340800,22,1745,4.677631578947368

583034,3,630316675X,"I didn't have incredibly high expectations going into this movie, given that it is a direct to video release.  It is good for anyone that likes movies with a ""justice"" tilt to them.  Think along the lines of ""The Crow"", a dark anti-hero arrives to punish those that do wrong.  The movie does have some interesting takes on the convention of Hell that are something that I had not seen or thought of before.  The acting is passable for the type of movie that it is.",1358121600,3,464,4.3604651162790695

Ive Got To tell the truth that made some parts of the movie not worth watching,but overall it was a good movie. i love the little non release to theater full moon movies.they are actually pretty entertaining to be low budget.i watch this movie ever now and then but its not a regualar for me.its a pretty rare,expinsive movie to be a vhs. now don't get me wrong i would pick VHS's over DVD's any day of the week. well before you do anything rash,go rent this movie first before you buy it.you might like it you might not. its just one of those kinds of movies.",1218585600,2,758,4.23448275862069
