6684647,5,B00NYC7PG8,"Great addition to the Despicable Me franchise!

Lot's of slapstick fun for the whole family.  Great backstory for both the Minions and Gru.  Fun romp in an animated ""coming-of-age"" plot.

WARNING: MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THOSE WHO SHUN/OR ARE DISTURBED BY NON-REAL, ANIMATED SLAPSTICK PHYSICAL HUMOR.",1436572800,4,300,5.319148936170213
6684648,3,B00NYC7PG8,"Directed by Kyle Balda (The Lorax) and Pierre Coffin (Despicable Me & Despicable Me 2) from a screenplay by Brian Lynch (Hop), Minions is okay, clever in execution with some occasional good bits but not much more than that.  Clearly meant to take advantage of the popularity of the babbly little yellow hench-guys from the two Despicable Me films, there's something however missing from Minions that keeps it from rising to the level of the previous films.

If you've seen the trailers for Minions, you already know the basic plot.  The film begins with a kind of nature-film prologue tracing the early evolution of the Minions, narrated by Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean) from their prehistoric origins all the way up to 1968 - or as the trailer puts it, the year 42 B.G (Before Gru).  The Minions have always had a deep-rooted need to follow and serve a powerful dominating leader, and so three of them - Kevin, Stuart and Bob (like all of the Minions, voiced by Pierre Coffin) - set out to find a new leader to give their tribe meaning and purpose once again.  After hearing about something called Villain-Con to be held in Orlando, Florida, the trio end up hitching a ride there with a cheery station wagon driving Nelson family - husband Walter (Michael Keaton), wife Madge (Allison Janney), daughter Tina (Katy Mixon) and son Walter Jr. (Michael Beattie), who also happen to be going to Orlando for some reason (no spoilers here, but the trailer kinda gives it away).  When they finally reach Villain Con, Kevin, Stuart and Bob end up getting taken on as henchmen by the world's leading super-villain - or rather villainess - Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) along with her husband/co-villain Herb (John Hamm), who immediately set the trio the task of stealing the Queen of England's crown. What happens next makes up the rest of the movie, about which I will say little to avoid spoilers.

There are some genuinely funny bits in Minions, my favorite being when the Minions penetrate the Tower of London and take on the guards. And there are a number of clever things about the film's execution, one being the way they work in various musical numbers for the Minions and the other being the language of the Minions you hear throughout the film, which if you know enough you eventually realize isn't gibberish but a mish-mash of words and phrases from probably a couple of dozen languages. (Some of the easier recognized ones are from English, Spanish and French but I was startled at one point to hear one of the Minions say ""Terima kaseh"" which is Malay for ""Thank you"". And there are a few ""cameos"" to keep an eye out for, particularly at Villain-Con where characters you may recognize from other films appear in the background.

But there is, however, something missing from the film.  A couple of things actually.  The first is that there's no real flow to the film - most of the time it's like a string of sight gags and situations coming one after the other, loosely tied together by the nominal plot. But the second and more critical problem is that there's no real heart in Minions, the way there was in Despicable Me, which is what made the first film really work and the lack of which leaves Minions coming across as somewhat flat, for me at least.  The voice actors were all good in their roles and managed to give their characters distinct personalities, but in the end they couldn't give the film what the screenplay they were working with never really had to begin with.

On a side note, the musical score by Heitor Pereira is adequate but largely forgettable, which fits the film.

Recommended, but mainly this film is for Minions fans only.",1436572800,6,3672,4.700934579439252
6684649,4,B00NYC7PG8,"It took me three years after the release of Despicable Me to finally watch it, and when I did-I ended up loving it. Now here we are two years after Despicable Me 2's release; as today I give my thoughts on the movie Minions.

The film opens to a narration, as the narrator explains that the minions have existed long before time itself. You see, the minions want to find the most villainous person they can, and serve that villain. After numerous failed attempts, in 1968 minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, arrive in New York where they find out about a Villain-Con and are introduced to female villain Scarlet Overkill.

Even though Edith, Margo, and Agnes are not present in this movie, Minions still manages to provide both humor and adventure for both kids and adults alike. Minions also sports a star-studded cast: Jon Hamm as Herb, Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill and Geoffrey Rush lending his voice as the narrator. Pierre Coffin does a nice job voicing minions Kevin, Bob, and Stuart.

The movie's story progresses in a relatively timely manner; which I feel is a good thing. The animation is as colorful and as rewarding as the previous movies. If there is one complaint I found with Minions; its that Scarlet Overkill is not as interesting a villain as Gru. Even still, Minions proves to serve as a solid prequel due to the voice actors/actresses, the animation, the story, and because the Minions themselves are just so darn cool!

So while we continue to wait for 2017's Despicable Me 3, I will say that though the movie is not perfect, Minions is still an entertaining movie nonetheless. And I have a feeling that the ending of the movie will make fans of the original movies smile just as much as I did. In the end, Minions is

A Good Experience

Rated PG

Despicable Me 3-June 30, 2017",1436572800,4,1800,4.623824451410658
6684650,5,B00NYC7PG8,"I was not at all surprised by the number of adults without children in the theater. Sometimes I think the Minions have more adults than children among their fans. For the unenlightened, Minions are cute, funny, easily distracted, and have a special fondness for potty humor and photocopying their butts. They laugh a lot. And they're absolutely loyal. Picture a bunch of hyperactive toddlers. Yep, that's the Minions!

This movie explains the origins of the Minions (voiced by Pierre Coffin) from single-cell organisms at the beginning of time, emerging to serve their first master--a T-Rex. Minions were created to serve--but, as narrator Geoffrey Rush explains, finding a master is easy. Keeping one is another story. They almost immediately cause the demise of the T-Rex...and it's all downhill from there. From dropping a pyramid on the Pharaoh to waking Dracula for an early morning birthday surprise involving sunlight to inadvertently aiming a cannon at Napoleon, the well-meaning Minions prove a hazard to villains throughout time. Finally, they go into hiding in an ice cave in Antarctica. Over time, however, they become deeply depressed by their lack of purpose. Kevin, the leader of the tribe and the smartest of the Minions (which isn't saying much, really), realizes they may not survive. He decides to leave the ice caves and go out into the world to find the Minions a new master.

Accompanied by then-teenager Stuart and youngster Bob, he sets off on a journey that lands the trio in New York City in the '60s. While trapped in a mall overnight, they see a TV ad for Villain-Con (Comic-Con, anyone?) and decide to go there to find a new master. They hitch a ride to Orlando with a family of bank robbers (Michael Keaton and Allison Janney voice the parents). There, while attempting to rescue his teddy bear in a mob of eager villains, Bob ends up winning a competition to serve the world's first female supervillain, Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She and her inventor husband, Herb (Jon Hamm), take the Minions home to their castle.

Is it just me, or is Scarlet possibly Universal and Illumination's single-finger salute to Disney? A female supervillain who's gone the evil route because she was denied her childhood dreams of being a princess....a castle that looks suspiciously like the one at Disney World....

Scarlet orders the Minions to steal the crown of the Queen of England. She wants to be Queen, and plans to take over the country. Herb equips them with some of his inventions, and they nearly succeed...until an attempt by little Bob to save himself and his buddies from the palace guards fulfills an ancient legend and Bob is declared King (think Excalibur). Scarlet is furious and accuses the Minions of betrayal. They immediately give her the crown and declare her Queen, but she responds by imprisoning them. They escape, and while their fellow Minions travel the world to find them, the trio look for a way to stop Scarlet. Do they succeed? Will they ever be reunited with the rest of the tribe? And how do they meet Gru, who will be their master for many, many years to come? Minions answers all of these questions.

The movie is fast-paced, frantic, and fun. Though some reviewers have found the script to be ""uneven,"" I disagree. I think there's a  possibility that Scarlet and Herb could return in a future movie--Despicable Me 3 is scheduled for 2017, so maybe then....

Whether you have kids or not, I happily recommend this one. Laughter is healthy, and Minions is just what the doctor ordered!",1436572800,6,3543,4.895
6684651,1,B00NYC7PG8,"This movie is so violent, disturbing and inappropriate alongside the fact that the story is...there is no story! My 5 year old cried to leave along with other children in the theater. One of the worst movies ever made!",1436486400,13,218,4.615384615384615

6684653,5,B00NYC7PG8,"It didn't take many focus groups to figure out that the Minions were the most appealing thing in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, so now they star in their own movie!

We begin in a primordial setting with the evolution of the species and quickly learn that the creatures who become minions need, above all, a BOSS! The next bit shows their unending quest to find one. In 1968 (enjoy the fashions and cultural bits), three of them courageously set out to explore the world and find true meaning in their lives (plus, of course, a boss).

Voiced by:
  * Pierre Coffin (""Despicable Me"") gives us Kevin, Stuart and Bob, our three intrepid heroes.
  * Sandra Bullock (""Gravity"") Scarlet Overkill is sorta the Cruella de Ville of this one. She recruits our three adoring heroes for her own nefarious purpose: She wants the crown that belongs to the Queen of England. Boo.... Hiss.....
  * Jon Hamm (""Million-Dollar Arm"") is her doting husband...who also mans her torture chamber.
  * Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") Enthusiastic Walter Nelson is taking his family to the Villain Con, Orlando's answer to San Diego's Comic Con.
  * Allison Janney (""Spy"") Madge, Walter's wife, is his supportive helpmate who also assists in the family business (wait'll you see...)
  * Jennifer Saunders (""Absolutely Fabulous"") is The Queen (who might be mistaken for another queen we all know and love).

This PG-rated animated comedy, co-directed by Kyle Balda (""Monsters, Inc."") and Pierre Coffin (""Despicable Me""), is based on a screenplay by Brian Lynch (""Puss in Boots""). It offers kid-friendly activities, like sliding down banisters and jumping on the bed, but also has some fairly intense chase scenes complete with gunfire and lots of blowie uppie stuff.

Be ready for a few fart jokes (this is as racy as a PG-rated movie can get), some characters in jeopardy, and lots of silly fun. This is another animated feature that includes generous helpings of scenery and situations adults will recognize (e.g., the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, still under construction in 1968, and Ayers Rock) with a script which often works on two levels. Our screening audience clearly enjoyed it. Me too....",1436400000,8,2177,5.0055555555555555

6684808,5,B00NYC7PG8,"Are you 60ish or better? You'll get a lot more out of ""Minions"" than younger adults will. The story is set in 1968, and the numerous sight gags and other cultural references will be much more appealing to those who can at least dimly remember the era. (I was in 5th or 6th grade in 1968).

 I adored the film despite not having seen any of the Despicable franchise, and despite previously wondering what the heck all the fuss was about these weird little yellow things. ""Minions"" is funny and cute, and the soundtrack is wonderful. I'm still trying to identify some of the ""homages"" to earlier film scenes, so I'd best go watch it just one more time...",1509062400,,652,4.470588235294118

6685013,5,B00NYC7PG8,"The DVD arrived safely attached to its backing in the case (not rolling around loose in the case and getting scratched by the backing attachment the way most DVDs arrive in the mail), and it played fine with no problems, even on my old about-to-collapse laptop disc drive. There are only two very small special features, but I don't mind. A commentary would've been nice because I do enjoy movie commentaries when it's a unique movie that I really like. There are some making-of and behind-the-scenes Minions videos on YouTube, though, so it's ok. The movie is the important part. The cover art is cute, too. Across the top, above the title, it says ""Bob...Kevin...Stuart"" where normally there would be actors' names. And there they stand, the little cuties, trying to look evil, not realizing that when you look like a sentient Kinder Egg capsule, you just can't pull off the tough-guy look.

It always annoys me when people on Amazon review the movie rather than reviewing the product being sold, the DVD, because there are plenty of movie-review sites out there and what I really need to know about is this specific DVD product.

Still, considering the way most adults hate Minions, I'm going to be one of those annoying people and throw in my perspective as an adult who enjoys the Minion characters.

If you don't need a movie review but only the DVD product review, you might want to skip the rest of this.

Minions seems to have a bad reputation among adults, but when my nephew showed me this movie, I laughed so much I had to buy my own copy of the DVD. These little guys are adorable and not like other contemporary cartoon characters. At first it bothered me that these so-loved characters are supposed to be evil. As I watched the movie and saw that the characters actually tend to be good-hearted for the most part and that in their innocent little minds they only amusingly believe they're bad guys, I thought that was pretty cute.
I haven't seen the Despicable Me movies in their entirety, only in pieces when I caught them unexpectedly on cable channels of hotel televisions. This one, the one titled Minions, was the first one I saw in its complete form. The Minions movie, compared to what I've seen of the Despicable Me movies, seems to be a bit cheesier, and you can tell they've put in some references meant to appeal to the parents' and grandparents' generations. These jokes are sometimes a little out-of-place feeling, and they come off as somewhat lame attempts to entertain the parents and grandparents, but that's forgivable because even the lousy jokes have some cuteness in them. Oddly, when watching with the kids, I enjoy it a lot more and don't feel like the parent-pleaser jokes are lame at all, but when I watch the movie alone without the kids, that's when those parts feel a bit groany. Maybe that's because the old-folk jokes are done in a kid-accessible way, so I enjoy the kids' reactions to the jokes. Maybe. Not sure.

Anyway, I'm an odd old-folk who enjoys the Minions, so I'm glad I have this DVD. Writing this review has put me in the mood to watch the movie right now...

Poopaye!

He likes to call them ""Bob"" He has Minions stuffies, pillows, blankets, clothing and toys. I ordered this Minion Movie for him on Amazon so I could download it and add it to his Kindle Fire Kids. This keeps him occupied when on the road or in an area without WiFi he can still watch it this way. Gotta have the favorite movie available for long trips!

6685257,3,B00NYC7PG8,Kind of hard to make a feature out of the babbling yellow pill-bodied minions from the Despicable Me films. They did a smart thing by focusing on just three and setting them out on a road trip. Funniest thing about the film was how these creatures gravitated toward and tried to serve different evil masters. That never worked out too well for any of those masters. Fans of the minions are likely to be pleased with this easy offering. It just made me want to see more of Gru.,1482624000,,476,4.359550561797753

6685490,5,B00NYC7PG8,Grandchildren loved this movie.  Hope there will be a Minion II some day.  Nice little story.,1470528000,,93,4.75
6685491,4,B00NYC7PG8,"Anyone who has seen either of the Despicable Me movies knows about the Minions.  They are those scene stealing little yellow guys who mumble mostly unintelligibly and provide many laughs.  Because of how hugely popular they are, I wasn't surprised when it was announced they were going to get their own movie.  Yet I worried that they wouldnt be able to star in a film.  After all, we really cant understand what they are saying.  I needed not have worried.

The movie starts way back in time when the Minions land on Earth and immediately begin searching for the biggest, baddest, most evil person on the planet to serve.  After several disasters, they retreat to a cave in the ice to live.  However, when they get bored, Kevin hatches a plan to go forth and find them a new boss.  Along with Stewart and Bob, he sets off to do just that.

When the trio hear about Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), they think theyve found the perfect new boss.  Shes the worlds first female supervillain pushing boundaries for the 1960s.  To prove themselves to her, she asks the trio to steal the crown jewels from the Tower of London.  With some gadgets provided by her husband Herb (Jon Hamm), what could possibly go wrong?

This movie is set in the 1968, and honestly, that is part of the charm.  We get some wonderful laughs at the culture of the time, including how the Minions interact with it.  The movie also has fun with the idea that bad is good, with plenty of laughs that play on our expectations.

No, we don't understand more of the Minions language than we did in the past.  Geoffrey Rush narrates the extended prologue set in the past.  Once the story really gets going in 1968, the interaction with the humans and the actions of our main trio provide all the context we need to understand what is going on.

Now I will freely admit the plot wanders all over the place.  Honestly, I still don't quite understand what Overkills master plan was, and a few twists seemed out of left field to me.

But I just went with it because I was having so much fun.  Heck, in a normal movie, I would call the first part of the film rather slow.  Instead, I found it incredibly funny.  The jokes are plentiful and constant.  And the Minions continue to charm no matter that we got a significantly larger dose of them than normal.  I laughed the entire way through the film and wasn't ready for it to be over when it ended.

The voice actors do a fantastic job bringing their characters to life.  This goes double for Pierre Coffin, who voices all the Minions.  Okay, so he has some help creating the gibberish, Im sure, but he still manages to get some emotion into their lines that makes it all feel real while providing multiple laughs along the way.

While the animation style is more caricature than some movies, it works and looks great.  Youll be lost in the story before you know it.

So if youve let hesitation keep you from watching Minions, set that aside today.  Pick up this movie and get ready to laugh.",1470441600,,3014,4.45970695970696

6685608,3,B00NYC7PG8,"If you could travel back in time to 2010, you might be surprised to discover some very unrelated major studious releasing some remarkably similar computer generated animated features.  In this case the subject matter was super-heroism and unlike say Pixars 2004 The Incredibles, these films would primarily follow the villain as the protagonist.  The films in question of course are DreamWorks Megamind and Universal/ Illuminations Despicable Me.

In the years since, Megamind has yet to be heard from again while Despicable Me has gone on to become quite the self-contained franchise.  The 2010 original film has since spawned a sequel in 2013s Despicable Me 2 and this, 2015s prequel (with work in full swing on a third installment).  Suffice to say, it is a rare moment indeed when DreamWorks finds itself upstaged in the arena of staying power.

A good deal of that staying power is attributed to Despicable Mes minions; small, gibberish-spewing yellow colored tablet and capsule shaped humanoids.  It was only fitting then for the franchises third installment that the titular characters receive a feature film devoted to them.

Enter Minions- a movie with a budget of $75-million that took in an unfathomable $1.159-billion at the box office alone.  With positive returns on investment of this magnitude, don't be surprised if minion-mania isn't a legitimate cultural phenomenon for many, many years to come.

That being said, whats Minions all about?  Well living up to its prequel status, Minions takes it back to the beginning- as in the very beginning!  The film opens with some 2D work depicting primordial ooze and the yellow single celled organisms that will eventually become the minions we all know and love exhibiting what will eventually become their notoriety: the tendency to follow the bad guy around.

From there its a visual history of all the would-be masters the minions and their antics have, um, prematurely terminated throughout the millennia.  From dinosaurs (quite frankly the minions having been the cause of their extinction would have been a concept Id have played with) to Dracula himself, we quickly learn that Gru is but the latest in a long, long line of minion villain-worship.

The core of the story takes place, though, in 1968 and despite depositing our yellow buddies in London, somehow avoids what I thought would be a certainty; the opportunity to spoof spy films of the era in the tradition of Austin Powers/ James Bond.  No complaints there though, we have Cars 2 for that.

Throughout its 90-minute run-time, Minions establishes a pace that could best be compared to vintage Looney Tunes with heavy reliance upon visual gags and slapstick to keep kids giggling.  Adults will likely be a bit less enthused.  Sure there are some pop cultural references and multi-layered moments for the observant to pick out along the way (the faked moon landing or the Beatles walking across Abbey Road for example), by and large asking the minions to hold the entire piece together is a bit of an exercise in silliness overload.

There are a few lights of hope along the way; Geoffery Rush providing narration that could make Sir David Attenborough proud and a brilliantly hilarious character named Herb Overkill played perfectly by John Hamm.

Conversely, the films villain Scarlett Overkill is certainly a disappointment in a franchise known for, well, its villains.  Looking as far back as to Vector in the first film, the Despicable Me empire has always been one of character-rich baddies and sadly Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) manages to capture absolutely none of that charisma.

In all, its tough to nail down a consistent conclusion about The Minions viewing experience, perhaps in part due to the fact that its tough to view the film as a single stream of consciousness.  As an individual who particularly enjoyed the exploits of Gru, the adopted girls, Dr. Nefario and so on, Ive felt that minions were best used as slapstick filler in the background to the human genius at the forefront.  Their gibberish, cuteness, annoyingness and bubbliness seemed always best served in metered doses in my opinion and in this case the entire balance has flipped.

On the other hand, I have to take into consideration that cynical adults are likely not who Universal/ Illumination had in mind when developing the film.  Weve been spoiled by the efforts of early Pixar, DreamWorks and the prior two films in the franchise; perhaps to the point of coming to expect a bit too much out of pieces designed to keep younger audiences enamored.

The truth is Minions could very easily have been little more than an hour-and-a-half long version of the animated series Rabbids Invasion.  Fortunately there is a bit more depth here than that and when the gags work, they work pretty well.

The films greatest crime, perhaps, is that it was born into a franchise that has, until now, managed to do a lot with a little.  This time 90-minutes of minion madness manages to be a lot for anyone who isn't little.",1467849600,,5029,4.979665071770335

I was so, so incredibly disappointed. Not only because the stories were actually pretty amusing/interesting but because I LOVE minions! Sadly, where DM 1&2 were perfectly cast to deliver the appropriate pitch, enunciation etc to delivery humorous punch after punch, I was left completely unaffected by this movie - a total fiasco in my view.

Personally, I also couldn't get past the minion gibberish - which, in this movie, so obviously borrowed words from Spanish and French languages that it was absolutely irritating to the point of making me want to mute the movie.

6685734,5,B00NYC7PG8,"I wasn't that fond of the Despicable movies, but I love Minions! The soundtrack is wonderful too, and I rather like that it takes place in the past.",1464652800,,148,4.321428571428571
6685735,4,B00NYC7PG8,"It has been honestly so sad that there really haven't been many standout films for kids that both kids and adults would absolutely enjoy non-stop. There have been very few films. The past decade showed us that it was both Ice Age and Shrek, and in the 90's Disney dominated so much of it with films Toy Story and A Bug's Life. But overall, there hasn't been many films that make you laugh that you cannot stop enjoying the film. But for the 2010 decade, that hasn't been shown yet with really good films. But it has changed this past year with the release of Minions. It has been one of those films that has not only been exciting and silly, but as a prequel to the mega-flicks Despicable Me 1 & 2, it has been a complete and absolute surprise that the cartoon actually is better than what the Despicable Me films have shown. It really is a surprise worth its merit, and shows that someone whom wants to really serve the bad, can actually serve anyone.

Minions is one of those films that is laugh-out-loud funny, as a prequel to Despicable Me, and a joy to see the yellow servant nuts, go absolutely far and funny. The films follows Bob, Kevin & Stewart as they go on a big search back in the 1960's, seeking their fiendish boss. Along the way, they find Scarlet Overkill played by Sandra Bullock at the convention, Villiancon, and are thrilled to take a chance on them for serving to thrill the super-maniac kind. Sandra does deliver very well, not just enraged at wanting the Crown Jewels from the Queen Of England. But overall, enraged with a feeling of betrayal, Scarlet and her husband Herb, goes on a vulgar war to kill and destroy Bob, Kevin & Stewart and wants to get rid of them as a betrayal of all costs. The film is really hilarious, and shows that anyone whom has been bumbling and thought of more of a joke and overeager  to do the right things to please their master, can please everyone. What I do feel is one flaw about the film is that I wish there could've been a English-to-Minion translation, so this way you could understand just how funny the gibberish language is from the Minions, and so also you could easily understand just what they're saying that makes them tick louder.

All in all, Minions is one of those animated films that I have absolutely loved from start to finish, and really will go back to it for enjoyment each and every time. Kevin, Bob & Stewart might be original, but they are originally nuts  to make you laugh out loud. If you have really enjoyed Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2, than you'll absolutely adore Minions. If you have never seen the Despicable Me films before, it still is a lovely film to start and sink your teeth into the wacko worlds of the little guys that are better than the main characters themselves. If you have been tired of all those similar films from Disney, or just want to be entertained, you'll absolutely love Minions, and the little yellow guy a lot will come out on top.

6685736,5,B00NYC7PG8,This movie is well done! It's funny and has a good story line and is good for kids as young as 2 years old. My son loves the Minions it is the only movie he will sit down for and laugh and smile huge! I have never seen him smile so big as when the minions laugh. There is also adult humor in there as well but it is very subtle. The soundtrack is awesome and the parents can sing along with the music while the kids watch the movie. The characters are clever and the animation is amazing. I would recommend this movie for any family!,1464652800,,533,3.9906542056074765
6685737,3,B00NYC7PG8,"A fun little kids movie, that fails to rise to the level of superb all ages entertainment that it's siblings Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 achieved. It's lightweight amusing fair of fart jokes and silly minion language. A plot that is barely there and makes no sense whatsoever. Strings of pop culture jokes from the baby Boomer generation and a final payout that leaves you wondering why you had to sit through 2 hours of forgettable kiddy fair to get to what should have been the movie. After all it was what everyone wanted to see. How the Minions joined Gru. Instead we are treated to 2 hours of Sandra Bullocks insipid Scarlet Overkill. We are force fed 3 incoherent comic relief characters as the main Protagonists (a Hollywood trick that never ever ends well. See: Pirates of the Caribbean 4. The comic relief always requires a main Protagonist to work against and cannot fill in for it themselves.)

Overall an entertaining but completely forgettable movie. Nothing overtly negative or offensive about it. Just a moderately well executed kids flick that is not well crafted or mature enough to hold adults attention for long.",1464566400,,1137,4.8307692307692305

Where is the love interest?  In fact, where is the same lovable comedic script writing from DM I and II?  Lots of great 60's rock music, coupled with a horrible mess of a movie.  Very, very disappointing.  The previews made this movie look like another Minions hit, but beware, the previews contained the movie's only few bright spots.

6685879,3,B00NYC7PG8,"Although my kids are well beyond the age of watching just-for-kids movies and my grandkids live far away, I still take in an occasional animated flick.  Often they are very funny and have rewarding stories and/or good songs.  So here is this spin-off of characters first appearing in the Despicable Me films.  The story starts way, way back when Minions first evolved, essentially to help the most uh, despicable creatures.  Things like T-Rex dinosaurs, Dracula and Egyptian pharaohs.  Unfortunately their help often resulting in their demise.

So searching the globe for the most evil person, they come across super villain, Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and sign up to secure the British Crown (literally, the crown).  Three Minions are on the task, Bob, Kevin and Stuart.  The rest of the story is the usual cartoon silliness without much in the way of adult humor.  I just didn't get the appeal, at least for grown-ups.  This one is strictly for the kiddies.

The Blu ray looks terrific however.  Using a 1080p video resolution with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the transfer fleshes out a detailed and colorful picture.  The bright yellow Minions in their blue dungarees as well as Scarlets bright red dress are sparklingly excellent.  No one should complain about the way the movie looks.  Its great!  The audio is first rate as well.  It comes with a Dolby Atmos track for those fortunate enough to have the gear to decode it.  For those of us who don't (yet), it will default to Dolby TrueHD 7.1, a beautiful, lossless option.  One of the fun things in the movie is the soundtrack which includes numerous songs from the 60s and 70s.  I kept myself entertained trying to guess the artists.  The surrounds are in constant play and the dialog/gibberish is well placed, clear and precise.  Subtitles come in French, Spanish and English SDH.  Here are the extras:

I've personally never been much of a fan of animated anything, but curiosity won out.  We were both pleasantly surprised by it.  We definitely enjoyed it.  In fact, we enjoyed it enough that we're planning to buy the next movie in the franchise.  Who knows, we may end up with all of them.  It does seem like this movie was developed for adults rather than kids (to satisfy the kid in all of us ""grown ups""), based on the level and type of humor as well as the many references to stuff from past eras.  We would definitely recommend this movie.",1459814400,3,690,4.420634920634921

The worst thing that can happen to a comedy is to figure out the punch line before the joke has even been told. That happens too much here. That is not to say there aren't moments you won't see it coming. It's just they are too few and far between.

Of course kids will love it and the silly antics of the Minions. Hey they are cute and lovable. And after all this movie is geared towards them. I would bet however they won't watch this as much as ""DM"" which I think has a better story to it.

6686380,5,B00NYC7PG8,"i can't believe all the negative reviews given to the minion. funny enough it feels like adult reviewing a movie for adult
this movie was not design for adult , it was not design to be intellectual or to make you debate about it for weeks . it was not made to give life lessons or be educational for the kids .

put simply its a comedy/ make believe movie .

it was made to make you laugh and relax. you have to watch it with your kids eyes ,a kid heart ,and an open mind.

the minion movie is a prequel to despicable me.

as for the ones who complain about not understand minions , minions speak ""Minionese"" , they borrow words from many different languages and mixed them together ( which i though was more elaborated and researched than pokemon language ). yes minion don't speak fluent english which might upset some of you .it wasn't that big of a deal for me ( or the kids who were watching it) , as the story itself is very entertaining
if your kids like pokemons , they will love minions

this movie also have some funny notes that kids might not get but teenager and adults might, like the end of the dinosaur , napoleon battle , caveman or dracula

the movie explains why the minion wears their famous outfit and how they spend their life searching for the badest , meanest person as a master .
the movie is also colorful and has great visual effects

now about what's age appropriate  , i will just say this : its up to each parent to decide what they want to showr or not show to their kids .this why i will not say its good starting a certain age. we all educate our kids differently . so on that part its really up to each parents to decide .

as for the kids liking or disliking the movie , just like us each kid enjoy different things . maybe you can show your kids the trailer first and see if they want to watch the full movie .

overall i thought Illumination/universal did a great job.",1457222400,4,1905,4.166212534059945

6686513,4,B00NYC7PG8,"Yeah, I wasn't exactly thrilled when this movie came out. Minions have quickly overrun EVERYTHING and it came to a point where I was just sick of seeing them on everything I came across. Despite the overflow of merchandise, which is very annoying and off-putting for many, I decided I should at least give it one view. And...it's actually kind of adorable.

It's true the minion's speech can get on people's nerves, but I found if I sort of tune them out and just watch the fantastic animation, it's fine. The side characters, though not amazing, are alright and even a bit fun; the main characters, Kevin, Bob and Stuart are each distinct in their own ways and Bob is probably the cutest thing ever. Though I have to say I love the villain in this movie!! Scarlett Overkill, though she has a ""eh"" backstory and motives, is just so much fun. Her interactions with her husband are cute and her overreactions are fun. The Overkill's seem to genuinely love one another, and it's so sweet. But...the beginning just sort of drags, and the end is just a little odd. I understand their trying to connect the movies and show how they met Gru, but it's still a bit off to me. Personally I enjoyed the movie most when it focused on the moments between the main villains and Kevin&co. The rest is ok. The narration does get on my nerves a bit and the jokes kind of fall flat in my opinion, but if you're just looking for something cute and aimless, it's a ok movie.",1456531200,,1454,4.4456928838951315

We were gifted family tickets and I wish I hadn't taken the kids (not just because of the movie but also because the theatre's volume was SO LOUD).  The female ""bad guy"" was annoying.  Minions are always funny and cute, though.  I hope they come out with another Despicable Me movie in the same vein of the first two.  The second movie was a masterpiece.

I don't like the digital HD rights system, in general, because you'll need to create an account and then have to access it. I don't like this system because may digital rights system have different apps and requirement. But, since this is a bad system, for every digital rights on any movie, I didn't used it on my evaluation of ""stars"". Just adding it as a comment.",1454457600,,475,4.654761904761905

6686994,5,B00NYC7PG8,"The Minions are an offshoot of Despicable Me, a surprise computer animated hit from a couple years ago. This time out, the minions are the stars, rather than being spear carriers for others, and the movie is an origin story: where they came from, their trials and travails throughout history. It is both lunatic and lovable. One thing that is never made entirely clear is how they reproduce, since they all seem to be male.

6687016,3,B00NYC7PG8,"I guess this is a sequel of sorts to the Despicable Me films. It tells the story of the Minions and their journey through history seeking a suitably dastardly master to serve. These prove to be unfortunate liaisons. Finally success is achieved in the service of a super-villain in Londons swinging 60s. My five year old really enjoys this and has watched it many times over. The charm for him is the minions themselves. He loves their curious language, indeed it is sometimes hard to get him to stop mimicking them.
From an adults point of view, it is passable entertainment. Most of the historical characters will be unknown to junior viewers but the scenes are fairly brief and entertaining to varying degrees. There is certainly some humour, some for the parents and some for the kids but not enough for it to be an out and out comedy. Theres nothing too racy either. Probably the most entertaining aspect is the 60s music and pop culture. These are hung around an interesting enough story which has got some really fun moments. It is a slightly uneven mix altogether though, so only 3  stars from me.",1454198400,,1104,4.661538461538462

6687466,4,B00NYC7PG8,"When I heard that the Minions were getting their own movie I was kind of excited, since I enjoyed them in Despicable Me so much but the more I thought about it the more I wondered how it would work.  Fortunately for me, the writers of the movie are very creative and they came up with a good movie and something fun for the family to watch.  The story really doesn't need to exist, not the primary one at least.  You leave the movie wondering if it was necessary to have the villain in the movie for anything but the canvas to advance the minions scenes.  I actually enjoyed the evolution scenes more than anything but Bullock is interesting if not necessarily needed as the primary villain.  The plot is forgettable but the fun tidbits make up for all of that and I rated it (graded on a children's movie scale) a four star.  If I remove the laughter and fun my daughters had watching the movie I would rate it a three but the purpose of the movie is to make kids laugh and have a good time so I didn't.  Actually, after saying that I should give it a five...my seven year old almost wet herself a few times she was laughing so hard and my four year old still talks about her favorite scenes.  It's definitely a good one to own, it's great to be able to watch something with the kids and chuckle and although it has a few ""4 year old level"" inappropriate scenes, it really does end up being a solid family movie.",1452988800,4,1413,4.226765799256506

While I thought the movie was cute I prefer the first two over this one. In my opinion the movie was a bit slow and not well developed.

6687548,4,B00NYC7PG8,"I was a tad disappointed with this movie once we got past the cute history lesson.  Love the Minions, hate the mediocre plot they shoved them in like an afterthought.  The idea of them searching for a villain to follow and then hitching a ride with the perfect solution to their problem (a family of bank robbers), but not knowing it, was amusing.  Scarlet Overkill, not so much.  Once she hit the screen, the tone abruptly changed (the torture sequence in the dungeon didn't help).  Basically, the Minions are depicted as (more or less) helpless children, especially poor Bob with his teddy bear and pet rat.  Trying to execute a child for a laugh demonstrates a certain lack of judgment.  Regardless, they lost me long before that particular scene.

Sporadic humor at best, I found myself begrudgingly liking it only because the Minions are so darn cute.  But they should definitely hire better writers for themselves.  And a better agent.

I loved the three mini-movies more than the feature.",1452729600,,995,4.828402366863905

6687606,5,B00NYC7PG8,"Contrary to most of the haters, I don't give a fig about any of the 'stars' in this, I just love Minions. We are in our late 50s and related to the music in a big way and totally disagree with those who say there is no plot line. Obviously the Minions were the big hit of the first 2 movies, so a prequel was in order to tell their story. I love their early days as amoebas and following them through history. Great gags and cultural references like Richard Nixon (who was in a split second scene at Villain Con), the debateable moon walk, the Beatles on Abbey Road, the ever polite and tea sipping British TV announcer, and great plot hints when we first get a glimpse of Gru at Villain Con and then at the end. I guess for the people who find it distasteful you have to look up the word MINION, and DESPICABLE. That is the whole gist of it--they are nutty little critters who have survived by working for the bad guys. Love the Minionese they speak--and we have found several of their phrases creeping into our daily lives. I am just now finding these movies because I underestimated them when they were in theatres, but I am a huge fan and find them very clever, delightful, and hilarious.",1452384000,,1192,4.302222222222222

The movie takes you on the journey of where the minions came from how they evolved  and leaves you off when they meet Gru. She loves all of the characters so much. She originally saw this movie in the theater and fell in love with it. It is a great movie for young children. There is only one part where she gets a little afraid but is already okay with it.

6687744,4,B00NYC7PG8,"""Minions"" is the prequel to the two ""Despicable Me"" movies, featuring the origins of the Minions and their long journey across space and time to find Gru, their master-to-be.  Turns out the Minions have been around since the dawn of time, serving many masters, most of whom come to a bad end.  With the tribe stranded in the Arctic without a suitable villain to serve, three minions set out on a long journey to find a new boss.

Kevin, Stuart, and Bob will make their way to New York City, Orlando, and finally London, to take service under Scarlett Overkill (nicely voiced by Sandra Bullock).  Scarlett's dream is to steal the crown of the Queen of England and take her place on the throne.  Somewhat, that evil scheme doesn't quite work out as planned.  Oh, did I mention it is 1968 in London, with suitable fashions, music, and slang?

There are plenty of laughs in the movie, and the young at heart will find plenty that is funny.  Unlike the earlier movies, the Minions have to carry the dramatic weight of the storyline, a role that doesn't entirely facilitate their comedy.  This reviewer did get plenty of laughs out of the 1960's parody, including a well-done turn on a young and feisty Queen Elizabeth II.  Recommended, especially if you have youth in your viewing party.",1451692800,8,1282,4.657777777777778

6687771,4,B00NYC7PG8,"My husband and I loved Despicable Me 1 and 2 so of course we went into this movie with some high hopes. We were only let down a little bit. This movie is more solid laughs and makes for a great time as usual. We loved the movie for the most part. I can't talk enough about the good stuff but after watching it several times since it's dvd release, here are some of what I thought was Pixar missing some great chances.
In the movie, Kevin becomes absolutely huge and begins to walk through London. I mean Kevin is the size of Godzilla and here is where I feel like Pixar really missed the ball. If they had had Kevin become huge in Tokyo like the old Godzilla movies, that would have been epic. Instead, they opted for London...um okay.
In the opening sequences, you see the minions serving the most evil characters in history from dinosaurs to Napoleon but these sequences are maybe 5 seconds long each. Why? Touch upon them some more. I for one would have LOVED to see the minions pretend to be vampires serving Dracula. I think that would have been a much better plot line than the one presented in Minions.
A lot of the adult humor was either lackluster or simply missing and that was a let down.

Overall, we love the minions as characters but we both feel like the Minions Movie kind of missed several chances to ramp up the humor. That being said, we are still huge fans. :)",1451520000,,1380,4.3076923076923075

6687777,3,B00NYC7PG8,"The only cool thing here was the end credits and the minions playing with Young Gru. I did not like this movie at all.

Sandra Bullock was very good in this. Voice inflection and emotions lined up very well. I thin it was the story plot in general that I was displeased with.

This was a gift for my husband. He loves the movie and has made me watch it five times in as many days. So as a gift it was great and well received. I am awesome. Yay.

I like comedy, but prefer family type films. This fit both genres. Crude humor and innuendos throughout, as with all the minion movies, and plays to adult audiences as well as younger, oblivious viewers. I could have done without the crude innuendos....

I am sure small children will enjoy the movie (their standards are not very high and they like the colors) but if you are looking for a movie with a plot you will be sorely disappointed.  This movie has a few entertaining moments (mostly presented in the trainers) but for the most part it just plods along with a mindless storyline that is not remotely entertaining.

As headliners, the Minions didn't meet expectations.  The movie had funny parts, but overall it wasn't written as well as its predecessors.  Sandra Bullock's character wasn't very interesting - she was more annoying if anything.  Of course it's hard to live up to the lovable Steve Carrell as Gru.  As the movie ended, I thought to myself that I hoped this movie didn't put the fart gun to any potential plans for more Gru movies.  I really do like the Minions - they're hilarious.

It had maybe four funny parts but the story was incredibly poorly developed. There was never a moment that I became endeared and wrapped up in the story. Just poorly done movie. They just hoped to capitalize on the popularity of minions and I guess thought they could put the jv team on this one.

6688007,1,B00NYC7PG8,"I'm sure this post will be down voted by the astonishing number of five star raters but this movie was just terrible. Ed Catmull from Pixar said they could make a great movie out of stick figures because story is what drives their movies. Minions takes the exact opposite approach; the movie looks great but there is almost no story line, no depth, no emotional connection to any of the characters (apart from the Despicible movies). It's basically a montage of staged events designed to let the Minions be goofy.

Well done animated movies appeal to all ages, but Minions will only appeal to kids under the age of eight (and that might be generous).",1450569600,10,650,4.6521739130434785

Is that something you want to teach your children?  Then take the amount of violence, far worse than either of the Despicable Me movies.  Then telling people you will ""kill them"".  Yes, I want my children to watch a violent movie, run around calling people the ""stupid one"" and telling them they will ""kill"" you (please note sarcasm...this is not appropriate for any child IMO but definitely not elementary school aged and younger like the movie was geared towards).  Not to mention other disturbing, dark ""jokes"", sexual innuendos, insinuations, promoting bad/evil behavior, etc. that I won't even call a joke or entertainment through this movie.  I had to turn the movie off in front of the children not even 30 minutes into it...that's how horrific it was.  Children pick up everything.  I finished watching this alone when no children were around, and I'm mortified that Universal would produce such a horrible ""children"" themed movie.  This is in no way appropriate for the children it (and the memorabilia) is geared towards.  As an adult, I did not find a moment funny.  I wish I could return this video, but because of untrustworthy people who copy and pirate I cannot.

6688055,4,B00NYC7PG8,"The film Minions is a good Cartoon for a family and for kids from the directors Pierre Cof-fin and Kyle Balda. It is 1 hour and 32 minutes long and is made in the year 2015.
The film is about a few minions who are called Bob, Stuart and Kevin. They are going on an adventure. They have to steal the queens crown of their boss Scarlet Overkill. But I don't want to tell everything, because there have to be  some surprises if you watch the film.
In the film are much things which are brilliant. For example that it gives a great view of New York. I liked, that the directors tell everything funny and that the weapons has so much strange effects. What I don t like, that there are so much turns of Scarlets charac-ter, so that you sometimes don't know if she is nice or bad. But I liked the idea that the minions are in a torture room. It was sometimes easy and sometimes hard to understand the minions, because they have their own language, but most of the time its funny to be not sure what they are saying.
I think, the film is better than Incorrigible 1, because it is an other subject and it is varied to see how the minions find a new boss.

6688197,4,B00NYC7PG8,"""Minions"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Ever since the dawn of time, the Minions have lived to serve the most despicable of masters. From T. Rex to Napoleon, the easily distracted tribe has helped the biggest and the baddest of villains. Now, join protective leader Kevin, teenage rebel Stuart and lovable little Bob on a global road trip where they'll earn a shot to work for a new boss-the world's first female super-villain-and try to save all of Minionkind...from annihilation.

The voice cast led by Sandra Bullock (as Scarlet Overkill) & Jon Hamm (as Herb Overkill) is pretty good. The directing by Pierre Coffin (who also did the voices to the Minions) & Kyle Balda is pretty good. The story & screenplay by Brian Lynch is pretty good.

The music by Heitor Pereira is pretty good. The film editing by Claire Dodgson is pretty good. The art direction by Olivier Adam is pretty good. The set design by Benoit Tranchet, Paul Mager, Loic Rastout, Vincent Massy de la Chesneraye, Thomas Reteuna, Charlotte Hutchinson, Alexandre Saint-Martin, Brett Nystul, Louis Thomas, Phillippe Tilikete & Pierre-Henry Laporterie is pretty good. The production & character design by Eric Guillon is pretty good. The set dressings by Florence Putzola, Antoine Prost, Anaele Vermot-Petit-Outhenin, Anaelle Moreau & Laura Giardini is pretty good.

This is a pretty good animated film that is entertaining and well-done. It is also well-made, visually, too. This is a pretty good spin-off of the Minions from the ""Despicable Me"" movies. The vocal performances by Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm & co-director Pierre Coffin are pretty good. This is (or was) one of the better movies (animated or live-action) of not only this year, but, of the recently passed summer season, as well, too.",1449619200,,1777,5.037414965986395

I kind of feel bad for little kids watching the end, though, because I couldn't help but wonder if some of the action at the end of the movie might be more than some of them to take. There was even a scary clown.

And Minions started off strong, but I kept waiting for a strong plot of story-line to emerge, and it never did.  It's like the writers took one of those short films that are often played during the credits of movies, and tried to make it 90 minutes long.  There were some funny parts, but the Minions was more a hash of funny scenes crammed together, than an actual movie.  I'm mostly upset that I had such high hopes for this that we bought the digital copy on Amazon Prime rather than just the rental.  That was $20 wasted, because we'll never watch this again.

6688242,1,B00NYC7PG8,"Despicable Me 1 and 2 were quite good, imho. As a result I purchased this assuming the third installment in the series would have a somewhat comparable level of quality, at a minimum.

Unfortunately, in this case, I was completely incorrect in that assumption.

Minions feels like a movie that was green lighted prior to a script being written.

Overall the quality of the writing is so poor that it feels like they ran with the first rough draft of a script that, even if completed, would have been rejected by a less desperate or time crunched project.

As a result this movie appears to have a minimal desire to actually include a plot, like able heroes, a truly threatening villain, or really any of those pesky story points you'd expect from a big studio film.

I feel like I've seen screen savers with a more complex plot. These characters really deserved better, based on this studio's past 2 films. I'd rent before buying.",1449100800,7,930,4.646341463414634

6688296,2,B00NYC7PG8,"Minions begins at the dawn of time. Originating as single-celled yellow organisms, Minions evolve through the ages, perpetually serving the most despicable of masters, from Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon. Consistently unsuccessful at keeping their masters, the Minions find themselves without someone to serve and fall into a deep depression. But one Minion, Kevin, ventures out into the world alongside teenage rebel Stuart and lovable little Bob to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. The quest eventually leads them to their next potential master, Scarlet Overkill (voice of Sandra Bullock), the worlds first ever female super-villain. Their travels take them from Antarctica to 1960s New York City to mod London, where they must save all Minions from annihilation.

A spin-off from the Despicable Me films, Minions places the little yellow critters center stage rather than as supporting players and they simply cant carry a feature film. They are not helped by a script thats light on comedy.  The movie gets points for its soundtrack, which consists of music by the Beatles, the Who, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and other 60s groups, suggesting that the film is geared more to parents rather than kids. There are also numerous references to other movies, such as the James Bond films, Cast Away, and Ghostbusters, which the adults might appreciate but will probably fly over the heads of children.

The character of Scarlet Overkill is pretty cool. The Minions, however, are cute but nearly indistinguishable from one another, and this works against the picture. Kids respond to star characters like Mickey Mouse or Charlie Brown or Elsa (Frozen) or Princess Merida (Brave). Such characters are the hook that draws the viewer into the story. As sidekicks and supporting characters the Minions are fine. As leads, they fall short.

Bonus extras on the 3-disc 3D Blu-ray/Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include three new mini-movies; deleted scene; Around the World Interactive Map; the featurette Behind the Goggles, which traces the story of the Minions; and an in-depth look at the films animation.

6688298,2,B00NYC7PG8,"This movie completely lacks any of the clever writing, witty humor,  plot development, and overall originality that made the first two so surprisingly enjoyable for adults.  In contrast, this seems like a hasty hodgepodge of formulaic, overused movie devices (e.g.  the background montage of 60's music) and forced, over-the-top Minion schtick.  All you think of as you watch it is, ""God, are they milking this Minion craze dry.""  It's like they didn't even try this time.  Without exaggerating, it seems like the script is a result of two dorky high school sophomores who brainstormed a Minion screenplay concept during lunch period before turning it in at the last minute.  Or maybe even middle school quality.  Seriously, the plot is THAT stupid and paper-thin.  It's so bad that it's hard for me to watch.  And it boggles the mind because they could've done so much better with a ""prequel"".

In spite of how I feel, the kids like it.  Go figure.  Still, personally, I would recommend searching for something better for an Amazon video library purchase.",1448841600,2,1056,4.965714285714285
6688299,1,B00NYC7PG8,"Coming off the cuff of Despicable Me 2, you would think...perhaps this ""prequel"" will deliver the childish story that is funny, witty, and a little dumb--but not in a bad way.  Unfortunately, if we were to compare this to prequels, I wouldn't hesitate to prop up Star Wars Episode 1 as an equivalent failure.

Most trailers show this HILARIOUS adventure.  It isn't...it is loaded with sexual innuendos that aren't discrete enough to pass along as ""for the adults"" like the disney movies of yore.  There is a distinctive and embarrassing amount of hypersexualization of the minions themselves.  Which is interesting, considering they (apparently) have no gender or are all eunuch's.  Either way, the action of Larry, Moe and Curly antics has been removed for this...movie--and it is a shame.

The movie itself, actually feels like a bunch of short stories that started to form a main plot point and they just filled in the gaps and hoped people wouldn't notice.  Most of what you would expect this movie to have (minion interactions of the prior films) is missing.

Congratulations, Minions...I did finish watching you...and while some points were laughable for those who get the culture reference (not kids) frankly, if you wrote this film for me, you should of packaged it with a nice single malt, because that is exactly what this movie needed.",1448841600,,1346,4.973214285714286

We watched it as a family - 2 young kids and 2 tweens.  Everyone was bored.  As a mom, it really bothered me that they just kept killing characters in a slapstick way.  My 4 year-old is trying to wrap her head around the concept of death due to two grandparents passing and a cousin who was diagnosed with cancer this year.  Death is not a joking matter in our family, and this movie is completely irreverent in this respect.  There were also certain undertones that bothered me, like the female villain who keeps coming back uglier and crazier each time.  It's like the Madagascar movies... I really liked the first two and then the third one was terrible.  I would watch several trailers before deciding to buy this movie for the kids.",1448668800,2,879,4.45

6688317,4,B00NYC7PG8,"I happened to buy this disc in a local store, a bit suspicious that I would not like it. I confess that I did it for the Atmos soundtrack. For a long time now I have been away from computer animation, for a number of reasons. Dolby Atmos, on the other hand, is quite an achievement, and is luring me into buying movies I would normally refuse.

Minions was, to my surprise, a delightful and well written movie. Granted, it is a bit on the long side, too long I am afraid and in the end tiresome, and it was not made for kids, anecdote-wise. However, despite any flaws if might have the minions as characters are clever and very well developed, making the film attractive.

More importantly, to me this is one the best Atmos soundtracks I have heard so far. If you are looking for an Atmos release to show off your new system this is a must have purchase.

[spoilers ahead]: And by the way, the Minions singing the Universal logo fanfare was surprisingly intelligent. When you see it for the first time it will make you laugh.",1448409600,7,1025,4.356020942408377

6688320,5,B00NYC7PG8,"I saw this movie 5 times, both 3-D and regular (not convinced 3-D was worth the extra $$) and pre-ordered it. Despite some inconsistencies with Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 (such as why they speak so much more clearly, although still Minionese; and age progression of Gru), it's hard not to like the movie. (Love the scenes in the dungeon...) When it's not downright hilarious, the Minions' indomitable spirit on their quest is, at the very least, endearing.
The 'violence' some have decried is no worse than that of the cartoons I grew up with - Tom & Jerry, Wyle E. Coyote & Roadrunner, Bugs Bunny, et al. - and the diatribe about it being Hollywood propaganda is over-reaching. If one looks hard enough, everything in the media, regardless of format or origin, might be categorized as propaganda.
For those who say there is no storyline, did you catch a glimpse of a young Gru, his mom, and Dr. Nefario at Villain Con? As a prequel, maybe it's not as fabulous an 'origin' story as one might like. But there are enough humorous moments and quotables to make it a keeper. It opens up possibilities for other stories on how they got from London up to the point of the first Despicable Me film (I hear dissidents groaning - okay, don't go to any more Minion-related movies).
Last, but not least: how many people stayed through the end credits and then stayed longer? There are essentially two ""encores"", but if you don't stick around until the very absolute end, you'll miss them.",1447977600,16,1484,4.64638783269962
6688321,4,B00NYC7PG8,"Minions, the third movie in the Despicable Me franchise is pretty much the movie you expect it to be.  Switching the story line to revolve around the side kick characters of the first two movies means we needed new human characters for them to interact with.  There is only so long you can watch these little creatures making noises and getting themselves into peril and I think this film had a nice balance of knowing when to switch the film to three of them looking for a new master.

I was kind of disappointed the whole Dracula scene (and some of the other early masters) was pretty much what was shown in the previews and not a second more.  I would have liked to have seen them getting up to some schemes for him before they accidentally kill him as with some of the other masters.  I loved the family that picked up the minion hitchhikers, I hope they get a spin off movie of their own or at least appear in the next prequel if one is ever made leading up to the events of Despicable Me.  I mean there are still a few decades to play with, the kids of that family, especially would be older so maybe they would only be in the start but they were really fun and entertaining characters that I really want to see again.  They could easily carry a fun crime spree movie of their own.

I don't know that I'd really need to see Scarlett again, I didn't find her that entertaining a villain, other than that she could beat other villains in a physical fight I really didn't believe she was the worst villain of them all.  She certainly didn't seem that intelligent.  But overall I liked the movie, maybe not quite as much as the Despicable Me films but it is still a lot of fun and there's plenty of sight gags.  You may get even more out of them if you were alive back in the 60's, I'm sure I missed some of the references.  I loved the running through the moon landing set.

Minions does have enough to appeal to both kids and adults. It has a few references to the popular ap Minion Rush as well, particularly the supersized scenes.  The movie is kid friendly, I mean we conveniently have the minions living in the Arctic somewhere while the two World Wars raged on so they didn't serve any of those villains.  If you don't like the little yellow guys, it's hardly likely you're going to be buying this movie anyway but if you enjoyed their exploits in the first two movies, you should check this out.",1447804800,8,2405,4.301552106430155
