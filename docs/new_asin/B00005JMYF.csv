1510227,4,B00005JMYF,"The ""bunch of losers rallied into a champion team"" story is one of the oldest in Hollywood, and this year's incarnation of the evergreen sub-genre is one of the best.  It relies on something extremely simple: the inherent funniness of seeing someone get hit in the head.  Thurber's screenplay piles joke upon joke - both visual and verbal - to the point of near-hysteria, especially during the training sequences and the early rounds of the tournament. Ben Stiller is marvellous as the ludicrously narcissistic/neurotic White Goodman, and the perfect foil to Vince Vaughn's almost somnambulistically unmotivated Peter La Fleur.  The supporting cast and cameos are all great, but in the end it's Thurber's relentlessly witty screenplay that shines.  It has a reassuring awareness of its own absurdity (from the elaborate subtitle, right down to the ""Deus Ex Machina"" emblazoned on the cash chest at the end), but respects the genre just enough to become one of its shining examples.  Very refreshing, and a step up for Stiller and Vaughn from the surprisingly lukewarm ""Starsky & Hutch"".",1096675200,13,1086,5.1477272727272725
1510228,5,B00005JMYF,"My wife and I saw this on opening night and laughed ourselves silly the whole time. The comedy here takes all forms - from subtle, to slapstick, to sexual references. The plot is standard small guy vs. big guy, but is very rewarding nonetheless.

Ben Stiller plays a fitness club owner who wants to buy out his neighbor's club. In response, Vince Vaughan's character is about to fold but gets together with some of his friends (one of whom is a pirate, who is absolutely hilarious the whole time) and enter a dodgeball competition. The rest is somewhat predictable but hilarious anyway. This movie is not about plot, it's about laughs, and luckily there are more than enough to last.

If you liked Dumb & Dumber, Pet Detective, etc. then get this DVD. You'll be laughing for days.",1095984000,16,780,4.644927536231884

Too many great quotable lines for me to bother listing off here. If you liked any of these films or you liked BILLY MADISON or HAPPY GILMORE, then this is your kind of humor. Who am I kidding, if you liked those films, it's 95% chance you've already seen this, so consider this a nudge to follow your intuition and buy this.",1504310400,,615,4.651376146788991

1510697,5,B00005JMYF,"Some fantastically comical moments. Parody upon parody upon parody and then silly zingers add to the punch. I recognized a few of the characters so closely that it brought actual tears to my eyes. Really. If you enjoy the comedic stylings of Mr. Will Farrell (not in this), VVaughn, B Stiller, J Bateman (Arrested Development anyone), Archer??, you will find solid chuckles to decent laughs.

Plenty of unnecessary - possibly offensive - stupid stuff, but nothing that detracted from the story.

This is entertainment.

I forgot how much I enjoyed it and even though I'm not-a-big-fan-of V.Vaughn's-characters I can still say, totally love this and will probably watch again soon. Justin/Jason (?) Bateman's character actually brought tears to my eyes. I dated that guy (the character, not bateman - just to be abundantly clear). OMG.

As word gets around town, White is unhappy and creates his own team to take down the pack of outsiders.

For, in spite of some disconcerting lapses and strange ambiguities in the creation of the principal character, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon.

And it doesn't have that disgusting/raunchy humor in it. Some movies just take it WAY to far. But Dodgeball is cute with mostly teen level humor.,1430697600,,288,4.452830188679245
1512027,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004)

 This one had an up hill battle to gain my affection.  I don't much care for Ben Stiller's work and I think Vince Vaughn peaked with his role as Raj in Be Cool.  But I have to admit that Dodgeball worked it's magic and won me over.  I think this film works as well as it does for the watchers is that the wonderful, deep line up of talented actors have succeeded in occupying their roles.  Often the directors have such strong control that the actors do not unleash their inner-in this case-wild and crazy person.
 Besides Stiller and Vaughn the cast includes Rip Torn, an actor of such experience in the craft that he can do virtually anything quite well.  Justin Long we know best from the series of TV commercials he did for Apple computer.  He in fact is a very busy actor with 74 credits in film and TV.  His diverse film genres span action films like Live Free or Die Hard, horror flicks like Drag me to Hell.  Reliable character Steven Root has a face we all recognize from one or more of the nearly 200 roles he has portrayed.  Alan Tudyk we remember from Serenity with vast affection but he as another 84 roles besides that one.  Jason Bateman rounds out the famous faces in this movie, faces we recall from their other work.  These guys make the film work.
 Writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber handled this project just right.  He also headed the 2013 We're the Millers.  He also cast himself in a cameo.
 This film had a modest $20 million budget but returned a huge $168 million at the box office which further enriched Ben Stiller in his role as producer.
 This PG-13 rated film gets a strong three and a half saw blades.  It runs one hour and 37 minutes.  These talented actors get a lot of laughs from tepid gags because they are allowed to.",1430611200,,1801,4.413373860182371

1512613,5,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story
 Dodgeball, starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, is one of the funniest sport movies of its time. What could be funnier than watchinga group of grown men play Dodgeball? This film will have you on the ground laughing while rooting for the true underdogs the whole time.
 White Goodman, played by Stiller, is a fitness expert and the owner of Globo Gym, a state of the art gym that has everything to offer with the newest machines and best trainers around. Globo Gym is located right across the street from the below average, nothing special gymnasium that goes by the name of Average Joe's Gymnasium, which is owned by Peter LaFleur, played by Vaughn. Average Joe's Gymnasium is on the edge of destruction and being ran out of business. LaFleur is late on his bill payments for the gym and White Goodman takes advantage by buying the gym out of spite. Peter has thirty days to match this offer of a ridiculous $50,000!
 Peter is in full panic mode when a member of his gym suggests him and a few other members enter a dodgeball tournament in none other than Las Vegas, Nevada that just happens to have a grand prize of $50,000 . After a lot of discussing and arguing, Peter agrees to enter and try his luck. White Goodman soon finds out about this little plan Average Joe's Gymnasium has in mind and decides to enter with the help of the trainers at his gym. Which team will prevail?
 Peter knows his team does not stand a chance when he realizes no one on his team has ever played dodgeball. Luckily he runs into a man named Patches O'Houlihan, one of the best dodgeball players of all time. Patches decides to help out Peter and coach Average Joes. After a number of hilarious scenes of the teams in training that will have you in tears of joy, it is time for the show to begin and it only gets funnier. Both teams put on a hilarious display of their dodgeball skills that is shown off in a mini two minute montage. After playing in a number of hysterical, rigorous games, you guessed it, the final consists of Average Joe's Gymnasium versus Globo Gym.
 The final game provides some of the funniest, heart racing moments you will ever watch in your life. From the countless face shots to the dialogue that comes from a comedic geniuses, it has it all. Just when you think that the match is over, think again. The match goes into sudden death overtime! During the sudden death, it is a show down between Peter LaFleur and White Goodman, long time foes. Each player gets one ball and the chance to hit the opposing player. This scene and movie have an ending that no one has ever seen before. What happens next? You will just have to watch and see.
 Not only does this film provide limitless comedy, but it also throws in a little love story on the side. White Goodman's banker who is helping him try to bring Average Joe's Gymnasium to the ground is a very good looking female played by Christine Taylor, who just happens to be Stiller's wife in real life. Her name in the film is Kate Veatch. White Goodman tries to make multiple moves on her, but she just laughs in disgust. While working for Goodman, she has to talk to LaFleur in regards to some of his finances for the gym. Little does she know she ends up falling for him and White fires her as revenge. Kate than decides to join LaFleur's dodgeball team and help take down White Goodman once and for all. This movie provides it all.
 This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. No matter how many times I watch it, it never fails to put me in tears laughing. Ben Stiller puts on the performance of his lifetime and gets the crowd going with his antics. Unfortunately, this film is not suitable for everyone. Due to some of its humor, language, and a couple of inappropriate scenes, the audience should be at least 13. It is PG-13 for a reason. I would also not recommend this as a Saturday night, sit down family film. It is more for a group of teenagers.

I have to add that the DVD Commentary was absolutely pathetic. Vaughn and Stiller walk out of the commentary about a third of the way through and somehow, Justin Long magically appears. To make it worse, they started playing the DVD commentary for the movie ""There's Something About Mary"". To listen to Vaughn talk about how great he is and how he carried every actor in each scene really shows what a jacka$$ he is. This is one of the worst commentaries I have heard.

Dogeball features Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor (wife of Ben Stiller), Ben Stiller, Justin Long, and a hilarious Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. The movie is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, who was behind the sneaky hit ""Were The Millers"". The movie is funny and has some great scenes in it that will have you laughing even after the movie is over.

But it's gags and cast and the choice of sport make it original enough that you can get over that.  I find it amusing that Christine Taylor had better on-screen chemistry with Vince Vaughn than her real-life husband, Ben Stiller...I ultimately atribute that to good acting, but it still amuses me.  Mr. Stiller made for an interesting villain...both creepy and intelligent (he had to be to build his fitness empire)...a dangerous combination.  The supporting cast were all wonderful, with Rip Torn as the wheelchair-using, foul-mouthed, abusive coach of the underdog team being my favorite.  I do wish we'd gotten more of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, the Dodgeball tournament announcers, and less of Chuck Norris and Lance Armstrong.  Overall, if you like sports movies and/or comedies, this is a film to grab.  Enjoy...oh, and if you go out and start playing dodgeball, be careful.  Apparently Ben Stiller hit his wife, Christine Taylor, in the face during filming with a dodgeball...I'm sure it was accidental, but I still advise caution...you never know who might seek revenge.

Help arrives in the unlikely form of a former dodgeball champion,the abrasive and now-wheelchair-bound Patches O'Houlihan(Rip Torn).
First-time director Rawson Marshall Thurber gives us a very entertaining comedy,viciously feeding off the many well-worn cliches' of the sports movie,delving very close to parody but wisely avoiding the paths taken by so many Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker wannabes.

1513148,3,B00005JMYF,"DODGEBALL is one of those movies that you read the back of the video box or DVD case and think, ""This sounds pretty good. It sounds like it has a decent plot, it's a comedy, and it's got Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn so it has to be fairly good."" Then you get home and watch the movie and can't believe how terrible it is. That's how I felt about DODGEBALL.

The set up of the movie is promising. Average Joes, a small time gym, has their mortgage purchased by Global Gym. The guy in charge of Global Gym hates the guy in charge of Average Joes. He thinks Average Joes is competing for his business and wants to turn Average Joes into a parking garage. The guys at Average Joes have to come up with $50,000 or their place is gone. That's where the dodgeball comes into play. The World Dodgeball Championships are being held in a few weeks in Las Vegas and the prize for the winning team is $50,000. But things go horribly wrong.

There are a lot of funny lines in DODGEBALL. Ben Stiller is hilarious for most of the movie (basically reprising his role of Tony Serkis from HEAVYWEIGHTS but for an adult audience), Vince Vaughn is witty as ever, Rip Torn is a riot as the team's personal trainer who comes out of retirement, and the movie has Lance Armstrong in one of the best movie cameos of the early 2000s.

But there's a hitch. Instead of going the high road of comedy DODGEBALL plays to the lowest common denominator and the movie drastically suffers. Foul language, crude jokes, every other sentence is filled with sexual innuendo. There's one scene where a group of young women are washing cars with their cleavage and there's another scene where Stiller's character uses a slice of pizza as Gold Bond. The movie promises to be hilarious, but it turns out to be a cruel, crude joke.

If you like the types of comedies that Judd Apatow directs and writes or are a fan of THE HANGOVER, then you'll probably enjoy DODGEBALL. Personally, I like my comedies a little less crude. As for the movie being ""A True Underdog Story"", that's just part of the gimmick. If you want to watch a real underdog story watch RUDY or MIRACLE.",1338768000,,2125,4.427109974424552

This one is right up there but probably not quite as classic as Wedding Crashers and Old School. A step up from Starsky and Hutch though. Ben Stiller was great in this as well. His character, White Goodman, was hilarious. Jason Bateman's small role as the color commentator, Pepper Brooks, was also great.

1513237,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball - The movie that you and your friends talk about for weeks
If you want to laugh and laugh a lot, this movie is a must see! Dodgeball is an instant classic with some of the funniest stars in the business. Ben Stiller gives one of his best performances playing the role of a stuck up Fitness Guru (White Goodman) who wants to take over Peter LaFleur's (Vince Vaughn) Average Joe's Gym.  With Average Joes Gymnasium in the hole $50,000 it seems like an impossible situation with only one solution.....DODGEBALL!
Just like it claims, Dodgeball is a true underdog story with the overlooked characters of society taking on the perfect team of Globo gym. From the first ten seconds of the film to the very end, you are hit with an urge to break out in uncontrollable laughter.  Not only do you feel a knot in your stomach from all the laughing you will be doing, but you also feel a sense of pride in the team of Average Joes. This will become apparent when you notice yourself cheering at the television.
To my surprise, it's not just another comedy film that you see with no plot and just a bunch of jokes; it has substance and constant humor which combines to create an amazing comedy production.
This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Watch it with some friends and it's what you are going to be quoting all week!
The only flaw that this film has is that every detail isn't refined enough for me to give it 5 out of 5. For a comedy of this stature I can make an exception, especially when other films like ""Epic Movie"" can't even come close to the plot scheme and fantastic humor combination. That is why Dodgeball gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.
This is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see and the twists in the story keep you interested throughout the movie. You will want to show someone this after you see it. It's what a comedy movie should be. Watch it.",1316390400,,1886,4.355113636363637

1513241,5,B00005JMYF,"Peter LaFleur is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's ecclectic clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds, and their own ineptitude,to try to save Average Joe's. By having a showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym. From the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job.  It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care. I could not stop laughing. There are so many jokes in this movie, you don't even have a chance to rest before the next one comes along.

He and Ben Stiller (another comic genius) are polar oposites in this movie and it works.....well.  This movie was an excellent example of what an ensemble comedy should be.  The ""Mongrel Race that comprised Average Joe's membership"" worked really well together.  I thought Joel David Moore was funny as dim-witted Owen who finally finds love with Romanovian dodgeball star, Fran.  Rip Torn as aged Dodgeball legend Patches O'Houllihan?  Also hilarious.  Maybe they ought to make a ""Gee, I'm sorry your dodgeball coach just crushed by two tons of irony"" Hallmark Card.  Justin Long (the ""I'm a Mac"" guy) was great in his breakthrough role as Justin - ""the Teenage Love Puppy"".  The on-screen chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Christine Taylor was so good and so convincing that, if you didn't know it already, you wouldn't think she was Ben Stiller's wife in real life.  Stephen Root was funny as nerdy Gordon who goes from milquetoast to mighty man during the Semi Finals when he sees his internet wife being hit on by another guy.  Chris Williams (Vanessa's brother) was good as Dwight.  Alan Tudyk was possibly the funniest of all the ensemble characters as ""Steve the Pirate"".  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

Vaughan, Stiller, Torn, and the rest of the cast really give hysterical performances. But why the four stars? Well, the only flaw here is that certain scenes do seem to slow the film down.

Patches O'Houlihan: Necessary? Is it necessary for me to drink my own urine?
Peter La Fleur: Probably not.
Patches O'Houlihan: No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste.
Peter La Fleur: ...Okay.

  OR

White Goodman: We should mate.
Kate Veatch: What?
White Goodman: Date! We should date some time. Socially. Go out and kick it.
[Kate retches, then forces it down]
White Goodman: Are you okay?
Kate Veatch: I'm fine. I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
White Goodman: In some cultures, they only eat vomit. I never been there, but I read about it... *in a book*.

i might be the only one that finds lines like these funny but if your into Justin long getting beat up by dodgeballs and wrenches then this is the movie for you.",1244419200,2,1148,4.36150234741784
1513326,4,B00005JMYF,"I also found something interesting during my visit to the Special Features. The first thing that you notice is that the layout of the section is Average Joes and the little scene off to the side is Justin's ever-hilarious attempt to catch Patches's dodge balls during training. However, look next to the balloon that says ""resume film"". You see a balloon that is Globo Gym's logo. Click it, and you are taken to a scene where the fat White Goodman says that every time he snaps his fingers in the movie, hit enter. It happens three times in the movie. 1. When White tries to seduce Kate in his office, 2. At the Dirty Sanchez, after White pushed the waitress onto the Average Joes's table, and lastly, 3. After Kate throws White against her door and he says ""nobody makes me bleed in my own blood. Nobody!"" After you press enter for the third time, you will be taken to the scene where White does his ""Patented 'Peek-a-Boo'"" dodge ball throw, then to the t.v in the Globo Gym building (the one where he says ""There's a good energy in the gym"". You, for quite some time, watch the little show on the screen before you are taken back to the scene where White gets on the Blue motor scooter driven by Me'Shell. The show is funny. I found that you have to press enter right when he snaps his fingers. It's kind of hard to get it right, but it does work.

I absolutely LOVE this movie!! I even stepped out of my preferred genre of action/horror/sci-fi movies to add it to my collection. This hilarious movie is better seen unrated, but if you don't want children to see it, or you just don't want to see it, you aren't missing much. Which is wonderful, because you don't want to miss any of this hilarious comedy. Patches' training procedure is enough to make yourself roll on the floor laughing. How Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, and Vince Vaughn say all those hilarious things with a straight face is beyond me, but it's funny as all get out! Although...I must say that I really hope you aren't drinking any liquids or are tired from laughing already....I really do...because the ending credits are priceless!!! It's too funny!

I got it:  something lame.

Ben Stiller is the stupidest part of this movie:  He doesn't deliver much comedy.  He's a Johnny One-Note who made me tired after his first 30 seconds.

The rest of the movie was passable.  I would have given it 3 stars for being a pleasant way to survive a 10-hour, cramped and crowded flight.

But Stiller was so boring, so pointless, so NON-funny, that I knocked the movie down to 1 star.

1513329,3,B00005JMYF,"DODGEBALL is kind of like passing wind in church; there's disbelief in having done it, and a derived guilty pleasure in getting away with it.  So I still scold myself for having seen this movie (several times), yet walk away with a cheshire cat grin.  Featuring low-brow Vince Vaughn as the hapless leader of Average Joe's Gym vs. ADD Ben Stiller as Vaughn's Globo-Gym nemesis, DODGEBALL is silly, morbid, redundant, and contrived--yet fun to watch.

Vaughn's okay, Stiller bounces off the walls, and Rip Torn and Jason Bateman steal the show:  Torn as dodgeball ""legend"" (and wheelchair-bound) Patches O'Houlihan; Bateman as a clueless TV color commentator on ESPN 8 (gotta love that dig on our culture's infatuation with all things sports).  It's a goofball comedy that has its fair share of ribald humor and its fair share of insanity--and all with a plot a toddler could understand--yet DODGEBALL still delivers fun.  And, after all, that's what a guilty pleasure does.

1513330,3,B00005JMYF,"Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid.

Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, ""White Goodman,"" a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk.

Christine Taylor is the token young ""hottie"" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.

Rip Torn almost steals the show as ""Patches O'Houlihan,"" the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, ""Patches"" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a ""fair"" rating.

A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad.",1233964800,,1631,4.5563139931740615

Okay it's better to jump over what's bad as I really didn't like this movie at all.

Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are outstanding in their roles in this unique variation of good versus evil; with the storyline focusing on the members of local gym versus the fitness mavens at a plush, state-of-the-art mega-center.

1513447,4,B00005JMYF,"What is there to say about Dodgeball - A True Underdog Movie other than it's a no-brainer of a hilarious movie that doesn't aspire to lofty heights. What it does do is come out firing with some of the funniest physical comedy and one-liners since The Farrelly Brothers' Something About Mary. First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good enough job to keep the laughs coming one right after the another to keep Dodgeball from becoming too repetitive.

The movie is a riff from the stock underdog sports genre with a Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn with his usual sardonic wit) having to find a way to save his Average Joe's Gym from being foreclosed by his bank and turned by a rival hi-tech gym next door into a parking lot. Who else would be the perfect foil for Vince Vaughn's Peter La Fleur but none other than Ben Stiller as the former-fatty turned workout fitness Nazi, White Goodman. Goodman's Globo Gym is a state-of-the art, sterile and BALCO-like gym where insults and making its members feel ugly, fat and useless is the way to clean health and the perfect bod.

Already, within the first fifteen minutes, we know who to root for and who to boo. In one corner we have the Average Joe's guys played with comedic timing by Justin Long, Stephen Root, Chris Williams, Alan Tudyk and Joel Moore. Stiller's Goodman and his consigliere Me'Shell (Jamal Duff channelling Barry White) with a hand-picked ringer of a dodgeball team he calls the Purple Cobras. With the two sides set the dodgeball carnage begins as Average Joe's must win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Invitational to earn the $50,000 needed to save the gym. To round out the Average Joe's team will be the bank accountant who ends up sympathizing with the Joe's, Kate Veatch (played by Stiller's real-life wife, Christine Taylor) and Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn in a scene-stealing role).

Rip Torn is hilarious as the acerbic and insane former Dodgeball great Patches O'Houlihan. He pretty much gets all the best one-liners in the movie the moment he appears on the screen. He coaches the Average Joe's team by browbeating them, insulting them and, failing that, throwing wrenches at them to help them in learning the 5 D's of dodgeball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge. In fact, I would say that if it wasn't for Rip Torn's character dominating the middle part of the movie, I think Dodgeball's constant ball to the groin shots would've gotten old. Instead Patches O'Houlihan constantly gave people watching a reason to laugh out loud.

Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story is a movie that the Academy voters will not think twice about showering with praises and awards, but I'm sure most of them will be watching it and laughing out loud like the rest of the movie-going public. Dodgeball is one hilarious, one-liner after one-liner ball to the nuts funny and it doesn't aspire to be anything else but that.

1513450,5,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is the type of over the top comedy that will always either be great or suck so bad that it is almost unwatchable. Rarely is there a middle ground with these movies. In this case, they got it right, I nearly wet my pants several times.

Globo Gym wants to buy out Joe's to turn it into a parking deck for their carb counting clientele. White acquires the mortgage and Average Joe's finds itself needing $50,000 in a month or face the wrecking ball. They soon find themselves entered in a $50K dodge ball tournament with the fate of the gyms hanging in the balance.

The boys from Average Joe's are a bunch of uncoordinated spaz's, which makes for some hysterical scenes. But they get some help when they find a coach. The coach they find is former dodge ball champion Patches O'Houlihan, played by Rip Torn. One of his theories is if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball. So he likes to hurl huge pieces of some of Craftsman's finest products at the teams' heads. He also utters such words of encouragement as ""you're as useless as a poo flavored lollipop"". All of the characters are funny, but Patches was by far the best quote machine in the movie.

There's something hilarious about seeing grown men hurl a rubber playground ball into one another's groin. But if that isn't enough, there are some great cameos and surprises in this movie. For once, the studio got it right and did not give away the best laughs in the trailer. And Dodgeball is one of those movies you're going to want to see at least twice because there are so many small touchs in the background that you cant possibly catch them all in one screening. I will give this one 5 stars, it's a must see, and I think a movie this funny is best seen the first time with a crowd.

1513452,4,B00005JMYF,"In true spirit of David vs. Goliath, Dodge ball is a play-by-the-book story about the little guys overcoming big odds and coming out on top.  Normally this kind of plot line could be a pit fall for clichs and highly predictable setups, but thankfully this movie is in the hands of a skilled director and fronted by likable and funny performers.

Rawson Marshall Thurber writes and directs a highly entertaining, low brow, feel good story that utilizes a game most of us played in our youth.  When I played we called it Warball, but it was generally the same.  In the movie, the plot basically follows a charismatic, likeable slacker Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaghn) who owns a lackluster gym called Average Joe's.  Financially he's in over his head, and he doesn't really care.  He's smart and capable, but unmotivated and lacks the confidence.  He's facing bankruptcy, foreclosure and a buyout from the big franchise Globo Gym, run by the feather haired, Fu-manchu sporting narcissist White Goodman (played well over the top by Ben Stiller, but certainly one of his funniest roles).  Lafleur and a misfit group of his gym members decide to enter the professional Dodge ball circuit and go to Las Vegas to win the money needed to keep their gym open.

Enter Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) as the bank rep who is pursued by Goodman but finds herself drawn to Peter.  So much so she joins his group of underachievers in the competitions, baring a softball pitch cannon of an arm.

After a hilarious regional bout with a group a girl scout-like opponents, the group find themselves on their way to Vegas with a chance to prove themselves and win the cash.  The dodge ball bouts are definitely the highlight of the movie.  Anyone who has seen the `Terry Tate: Office Linebacker' commercials can tell the kinetic style transfers well to the big screen.  The climax features a showdown between the Globo Gym and Average Joe's.  The rest of the cast is well placed, especially role of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn, and the younger version played by Hank Azaria.  The number of cameos is impressive as well; William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff as the German teams coach and especially funny is Jason Bateman as a former Dodge ball champ turned analyst whose commentary leaves intellect at the front door.  In all, this is a feel good movie for adults, probably more directed at men, but still funny for all.  Using a childhood memory, whether good or bad, and making it funny and entertaining.  For everyone who probably wasn't very good at the game as a kid, this movie will make you believe you can be good at it as an adult.",1170633600,,2678,4.757575757575758

1513506,3,B00005JMYF,"Let's get one thing straight: there really is, God help us, an International Dodge Ball Federation.  That alone seems like enough of an excuse for a comedy about the sport.  And lo, Ben Stiller saw that it was good and he made a movie about it with mixed results.

Ben Stiller usually plays sympathetic, frustrated nerds who lose their tempers when things don't go their way.  In Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, the usual Stiller charm has been dropped and replaced by an arrogant, irritating character named White Goodman.  He is the founder of an extremely popular gym that has plans to expand by taking over extremely uptight, fastidious Peter La Fleur, played by Vince Vaughn.

Just kidding!  Of course Vaughn wouldn't play anyone uptight or fastidious.  He's made a career out of playing easygoing regular Joes, sometimes with large vocabularies that betray a hint of intelligence, who don't work too hard and just want to get by in life. When Vaughn is paired with an even more mellow guy like Owen Wilson, it makes Vaughn look animated in comparison and the two become an excellent combination of mellow/acerbic.  See Wedding Crashers for a more palatable mix.

But alas, Wilson isn't in this film.  Instead, Le Fleur is backed by a cast of equally lovable idiots, including obscure sportsphile Gordon (Stephen ""Red Stapler"" Root), clueless Owen (Joel Moore), normal guy Dwight (Chris Williams), the appropriately named Justin (Justin Long), and for some reason that only Stiller understands, Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk). Le Fleur falls hard for the lovely Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor and Stiller's wife), a lawyer in the employ of Goodman.

How can our just-like-you gaggle of guys possibly beat the overcoifed, hyperactive Goodman?  Why, with a little training from the dodgeball champion himself, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is the funniest character in the entire movie.  That's not a compliment.

Like the ill-fated Anchorman, Dodgeball is actually more amusing to quote than it is to watch.  Stiller is much funnier as an underdog and makes for a two-dimensional villain.  Vaughn is unbelievable as a successful business owner and flounders without a foil to play off of.  Taylor tries, again, to be the straight woman like she did in Anchorman, but she's too slickly attractive to pull it off convincingly.

Thing is, Dodgeball doesn't care if you like it.  Jason Bateman, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, William Shatner, and David Hasslehoff all make appearances, so it's obvious the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  On the other hand, the amusement around these characters being in the movie depends directly on the cultural relevance to the audience.  The Chuck Norris jokes are getting a little creaky.

If you watch Dodgeball with your buddies and a case of beer, it definitely earns five stars.  Otherwise it's merely a passable entry in the goofy sports genre.",1167955200,,2905,5.080168776371308

I loved the characters in this one, as well as the main characters.  The ""Marcia Bradey"" look-a-like was also nice. Too bad she didn't have any nude scenes.  I could have continued my adolescent male fantasies into modern time.  But I'm sure you don't want to read about that.

An excellent comedy, Dodgeball, brings to the screen the story of a gym owner and his friends as they take part in the annual Dodgeball tournament in order to win 50,000 dollars and save their gym from a hostile takeover.

Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

There are also the guest appearances of actors such as William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and David Hasselhoff among others, who add a great deal to the overall enjoyment.

Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!

The pirate was a bit much, but the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  Quotes like ""Time to put your mouth where your balls are,"" says it all!

Finally, the dvd's Special Features are a ""must.""  The deleted scenes, the bloopers, and the alternative ending are so worth it!

Vaughn and Stiller are both terrific in the lead roles, but it's Rip Torn who perhaps turns in the performance of his career, chewing up scenery as the crusty, slightly tetched, wheelchair-bound Patches O'Houlihan, former seven-time dodgeball all-star, who takes La Fleur's clueless misfits and molds them into clueless winners with a training regimen that includes dodging wrenches and traffic, verbal intimidation, and a take-no-prisoners approach to the game.  The only downside to Torn's portrayal is trying to deflect my kids' questions about snatches of dialogue like ""queerbait,"" ""crotch stain,"" ""dyke,"" and ""a bunch of retards trying to hump a doorknob"" with ""Go ask your mother.""",1134432000,6,1253,5.3232323232323235
1513721,4,B00005JMYF,"In many ways, ""Dodgeball"" is exactly what you think it's going to be: a slob comedy in the classic mold (like ""Stripes"" or ""Caddyshack""), with the snobs vs. the slobs.  And ""Dodgeball"" delivers plenty of laughs along those lines.  Despite all of the broad physical humor, ""Dodgeball"" manages to throw in a number of very subtle and dry gags, and has a lot more intelligence than you might think.

However, ""Dodgeball"" takes a while to get moving.  The first 20 minutes are so lifeless and devoid of comedy that we almost kicked the DVD out of the player and abandoned the rest of the movie.  I'm glad I didn't, because the remainder of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny.  The problem is not Vince Vaughn, but his character and the way he's directed.  You never get the feeling that the character really cares about keeping the gym, so you don't get too invested in whether he wins the dodgeball competition or not.  Further, Vaughn, who is an excellent actor who has plenty of comedic energy, just doesn't display it unless Ben Stiller is on screen with him.  This suggests that the fault lies with the director, who seems like he wanted Vaughn to play it a bit too laid back.  What the role needed was the energy of a Bill Murray or Chevy Chase who can do laconic without being listless, and I'm afraid the director just didn't get that.

Jason Bateman steals the movie as the stoner co-anchor of the dodgeball broadcast.  If you've ever seen ""Arrested Development,"" you'll laugh twice as hard, because this character is the exact opposite of Michael Bluth.  Bateman would have been a good choice for Vaughn's role as well.

The deleted scenes and alternate (original) ending were pretty good.  I actually prefer the original ending, which is truer to the characters, but I understand why the studio freaked out.

Kudos on the Curtis Armstrong cameo!  And you will also enjoy Shatner in his best role since James T. Kirk.",1133308800,,1922,4.6895522388059705
1513722,5,B00005JMYF,"""Dodgeball"" is something from left field on more than one count, and something quite new for Ben Stiller. Neeedless to say, I laughed until I nearly saw lunch again, and laughed some more.

The plot is pretty simple: small time gym owner nearly loses gym to big time, flashy competitor who is so full of himself that it defies description. Add a love interest, and some excellent comedy, and you have ""Dodgeball"".

I have a very violent sense of humour, (I thought ""Hannibal"" was a laugh, just to give you an idea), so ""Dodgeball"" really appealed to me. As others have mentioned, the ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"" scene is priceless in its comedy. To see the poor guy squirming on the floor in abject pain was truly hilarious.

Additionally, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria as Patches O'Houlihan are both brilliant. Describing the game as ""degradation, violence and exclusion"" was genius, followed by more violent humour.

Ben Stiller deserves special mention for his performance as White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, the evil rival. Getting way outside his usually anal-retentive characters, Stiller makes a disturbingly good prick and general nasty type.

""Dodgeball"" has it all: feel good story, violent humour, sexual innuendo, situational humour, satire and just great fun all round. For a seriously good laugh, this movie is the funniest I have seen since ""Team America""!",1132531200,,1394,4.965665236051502
1513723,4,B00005JMYF,"""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!"" -- that's a great line! And this is a very funny film.  Ben Stiller is perfect in this one -- his unique style of comedy was perfect for the role (I love when the camera comes up to him near the beginning during his commercial, and he turns and says ""Oh, hi!"").  Vince Vaughn and the rest of the cast are also teriffic here.  It's a little crude, a little...violent actually(!), but it's very funny.  One of the funnier films I've seen recently.",1131494400,2,496,4.24468085106383
1513724,4,B00005JMYF,"Ben Stiller plays White Goodman, a pompous gym owner who tries to take over ""Average Joe's Gym"", currently owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn). The crew at Average Joe's are tight-knit and decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in order to win the $50,000.00 grand prize that will enable Peter to keep the gym open. Patches O'Houlihan then comes along to train the group of hopeless misfits for the tournament.

The best character, of course, is Stiller's White Goodman character. Stiller really nails the role of someone whose ineptitude and artificiality will crack you up. You will love to hate White Goodman.

Vince Vaughn plays off Ben Stiller extremely well, as usual. These two make a hell of a comic duo and I hope to see more from them in the future.

This movie is pretty hilarious and I would certainly recommend it to any Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn fans. Comedy fans in general will enjoy this film.",1131062400,3,914,4.735849056603773

Yes, Ben Stiller can do a lot better, and I truly loved the kind of humor he did on his TV show for Fox back in the early 1990s.  But in the final analysis there's something winning about this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink formula of outrageous physical gags, over-the-top characters, and silly situations. By the end of the movie, I found myself cheering for the downtrodden heroes.  Jeez, what was I thinking!!!!

But as much as I liked both the actors and the performances, this movie felt like it was falling apart every few scenes. Whenever people were getting pelted in the faces with balls and wrenches I was laughing - hey, slapstick gets me everytime. But the tedious dialogue scenes when the point is being reinforced that Ben Stiller's character is a total a-hole...ok, ok - we get it. And I'm sorry, they really over-did the grossness: they have to go out dressed in S&M gear, a man's head goes up the fat girl's butt in a cheerleading routine, etc.

Vaughan doesn't seem to have his heart in this much either. I know he's supposed to play kind of a loser, but I wish he'd do it with some style. He played a loser with style in ""Be cool"". But maybe after reading the script he decided it wasn't worth the effort. Ditto for Rip Torn.

A couple notable performances: Missi Pyle, versatile as ever as ""Fran"", a murderous dodgeball champion from Eastern Europe, Justin Long who I also remember from ""Galaxy Quest"" and Stephen Root who I loved in ""Office Space"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou"".",1129852800,,1265,4.5394736842105265

He's determined to take over a smaller ""loser"" gym, Average Joes, run by Vince Vaughan. This comedy is a good-hearted fable about the average guy respecting himself and maintaining his integrity in the face of a culture rendered grotesque by its extreme vanity and naricissism, the embodiment of which is seen in the Ben Stiller character.

From Starsky & Hutch, to Old School, to Swingers, to Made, and even his small role in Anchorman, Vaughn has a straight laced, comedic style that is a laugh riot.  Vaughn plays a down on his luck, small time gym owner who is about to lose his business to a dim-witted fitness mogul (Ben Stiller, perfectly and stupidly sleazy) unless he can cough up 50 thousand dollars.  Vaughn, along with a rag tag band of losers and friends (including Alan Tudyk, Stephen Root, and Justin Long among others) enter a dodgeball tournament to win the cash, with Stiller opposing them.  The outcome is predictable, but thanks to the quick direction of Rawson Marshall Thurber, and the zany performances from Vaughn and Stiller, Dodgeball turns out to be a mainstream crowd pleasing comedy that's actually pretty funny.  Also featuring Stiller's hot off screen wife (Christine Taylor), Rip Torn as the team's mentor, and hilarious cameos from Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, William Shatner, and Hank Azaria which keep the laughs coming.",1128124800,2,1178,4.894472361809045

1513750,3,B00005JMYF,"I have to say I was quite wary about this film. I'm not Ben Stiller's biggest fan. Never have been, never will be. His humour just does not appeal to me. And I always get him & Adam Sandler muddled up. I swear they're the same guy. Why is it as well that they put a very bad wig and moustache on him, and do their best to make him look like a very bad porn star? Surely he didn't think he looked good?! And I have never seen a film with Vince Vaughn before. The only things I know about him is that he's very tall (and I'm very small, so I won't be standing next to him anytime soon), and he's rumoured to be dating Jennifer Aniston.

Isn't Dodgeball a game you would play in primary school? Well, it certainly is now, with the influence of the game. I have to say I would have failed miserably at this game. I have no hand-to-eye co-ordination, and if I have to avoid something (like a ball coming flying at you), then I'd walk straight into it. And how many shots were there in the movie of a poor guy getting hit in the ... y'know? I'm not a guy, but have been told that the pain is indescribable, and you certainly do not get up straight afterwards, and carry on. Now, if I was crossing my legs during the film, what would an average guy be doing?! It's too scary to think about.

Was it deliberate that extremely tall people surrounded Ben Stiller? Vince Vaughn must be well over 6ft, and there was also that guy who was ""White's"" right-hand-man, who's name sounded a lot like Michelle, he was big too. In fact, most of White's team was taller than him.

I have to say compared to other reviews, which have compared this to Kingpin & Baseketball, I disagree. Mind you, I wasn't taken by both films (have I seen both?), and much prefer this movie.

I loved Christine Taylor in this (Ben's real life wife! Awwwwwww), I was loving the braids, and the way she played against the stereotypical girl in this film. By the looks of some shots, she really went for it! Even if her hubby did break 3 cameras, and also hit her in the face. (I'll bet he was making up for that later.)

The film is very fast-paced, and you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat for most of the film, trying not to bite your nails. There's also quite a few cameos, including absolute hilarious turns by David Hasselhoff & William Shatner. However, I didn't get the cameos by Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria and who is Chuck Norris?

The extras are quite reasonable, the gag reel is so funny! But the rest of it is just your usual bog-standard extras. Nothing special.

I quite enjoyed this film, and had a good laugh with it. The wig Ben Stiller is wearing though is unforgivable however. Ugh. Poor Christine.

1513752,3,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball is not an exceptional movie, but as mainstream comedies go it's pretty entertaining and has moments that are incredibly funny.  To keep from getting their gym bought by the megalomaniac fitness guru White Goodman (played with over-the-top creepiness by Ben Stiller), Peter Le Fleur (Vince Vaughn) and his ensemble of odd companions must raise 50,000 dollars in 30 days.  They do so by entering a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament, which will be broadcast on ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"").

First they must qualify in a regional championship, which they win only because one member of the Girl Scout troupe who trounces them on the court tests positive for various enhancement drugs.  After that, they get taken under the wing of a crazy wheelchair-bound ex-dodgeball player, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), whose tactics include making the team dodge wrenches and oncoming traffic.  Once in Las Vegas, they will have to compete against White Goodman and the musclebound team he's put together, after going head-to-head with a number of other teams, including a group of hardcore German players coached by a brutal David Hasslehoff.

One reason the movie works so well is because Vaughn plays his character in a laidback, smart-alecky way, which balances all the weirdness surrounding him.  The supporting cast is memorable and strong: there's a middle-aged nerd who can only really play well when he loses his temper, a high school geek with surprising cheerleading skills, a man who's convinced he's a pirate, and a few other endearing misfits.  There's also a love interest played by Christine Taylor, who has a strong head and can really pack a punch.

Dodgeball is crude, plays to certain stereotypes, but also breaks the mold in other ways and manages to be endearing and have loveable characters.  It's a couple of hours of good, ridiculous, over-the-top fun.",1126569600,,1861,5.112211221122112

1513755,4,B00005JMYF,"If you take one of the funniest ""sports"" movies from recent years -- ""Cool Runnings"" about the Jamaican bobsled team -- and mix it with the one liners from ""Airplane"" and throw in the inappropriate sexual references from any fraternity movie, you've got ""Dodgeball"", a sort of ""Putney Swope"" of sports movies.

This movie is creative, predictable, obvious, profane, tasteless...and is one of the funniest movies of 2004 or any other year. It is a laugh riot where acting, situations, one liners and a nincompoop plot all merge to create a comedy that's more entertaining than most movies.

The one liners come often and are usually laden with sexual conntent. ""Useless as a lollipop that tastes like a (male genitalia)"" is a line from one actor. Another, recounting the miracles he's seen in life, says, ""I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel.""

Ben Stiller is protagonist to Vince Vaughn's antagonist in this flick about competing health clubs, good guys and bad guys. Stiller is more in character throughout this movie than anytime I've ever seen him, while Vaughn plays himself. David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, William Shatner and Lance Armstrong all play small roles parodying themselves along the way.

The title action plays the deciding role in whether the good guy or bad guy will prevail, although everyone knows from the beginning who's going to come out on top. Another one liner about the dodgeball competition is that it is broadcast nationwide on ""ESPN 8, the Ocho"", a comic parody of ESPN2, which is known in the industry as ""the deuce.""

While there is no denying this is one of the funniest films of recent years, you are warned not to share this video with your kids unless you want to incur the wrath of your wife or answer question all night like, ""Daddy, what's a dyke?"" The sexual content in this profane film is heavy and consistent. It never relents and takes a new twist at the very end.

1513758,3,B00005JMYF,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.

Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called ""Average Joe's"" that caters to the....um...how shall we say it?... less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer.  Pete's patrons are all ""losers"" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are.  The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place.  Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise.  To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships.  When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.

Most of the humor in ""Dodgeball"" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile.  Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy.  Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team.  The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film.  But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape.

The character could obviously be the most dangerous comic character in awhile, but instead, the director just allows him to be ordinary, to seem like one of the guys, and even though one of the funniest jokes emmerges when Owen doesn't recognize that he's a pirate and then knowingly acknowledges it later in the film.  I think one of the things that makes the movie really funny is Ben Stiller's willingness to take a chance with his comedy and not care whether it's actually funny or not, he just goes the distance.  In terms of the DVD, it's first rate.  Yes, there's features and commentary, deleted scenes, etc, but there's an easter egg if you can find it, as a matter of fact there's a key to a number of them throughout the picture and hopefully you find them and enjoy them.

1513810,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball...I remember it well, back from my grade school days...always aim for the face...or the `nads...and now there's actually league of adults out there playing it on a professional level?  I'll never understand the absurdity of the regressive attitudes tied into taking the simplistic games we enjoyed playing when we were children and turning them into professional sporting events...I dunno, it kinda takes the magic out of being a kid...just my opinion, I suppose.  Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Terry Tate, Office Linebacker), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) stars Vince Vaughn (Old School, Be Cool) and Ben Stiller (Meet the Parents, Starsky & Hutch).  Also appearing is Stiller's wife Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie, The Wedding Singer), Rip Torn (The Beastmaster, Airplane II: The Sequel), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), Stephen Root (""NewsRadio"", Office Space), Joel Moore (Art School Confidential), Chris Williams (Friday After Next), Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development""), and Hank Azaria, the man behind the voice of Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Cletus, Prof. Frinkon, to name a few, on the TV show The Simpsons.

As the movie begins we meet a character by the name of Peter La Fleur (Vaughn), owner and proprietor of the Average Joe's Gym.  Business could certainly be better, but then Peter seems a soft touch, especially since he hasn't collected dues from his rather unique and distinctive membership (one guy thinks he's a pirate, and swears he'll pay off his debt once he remembers where he buried his treasure) in over a year.  Anyway, seems the bank is in the process of foreclosure, prompted by Peter's competition in that of the highly narcissistic White Goodman (Stiller), who runs the high tech Globo Gym `Here at Globo Gym we're better than you, and we know it' across the street, having designs on acquiring the property, leveling it, and turning it into a auxiliary parking lot for his elite clientele.  Peter learns from bank representative Kate Veatch (Taylor) that in order to save his gym he needs to raise $50,000 within 30 days, a seemingly insurmountable task, but opportunity comes in the form of a dodgeball tournement, one where the team that wins the finals, held in Las Vegas, is awarded a prize of the exact amount needed to save the gym.  Goodman learns of Peter's plan, organizes his own team, including a scary uni-brow female ringer from some Soviet breakaway republic, to ensure his nefarious scheme doesn't fail, but Peter and his band of sorry, uncoordinated geeks, losers, and oddballs finds help in that of 7 time dodgeball all star Patches O'Houlihan (Torn), who signs on as their coach (utilizing some unusual techniques and also having some of the best lines)...will the boys prevail?  Perhaps, but they're going to need some serious help, a little luck, and a whole lot of balls...

This movie is worth watching if nothing else than to see Justin Long getting clobbered in the face with a wrench...oh, I know it was a rubber prop, but still, it looked darn realistic, and elicited a strange sense of satisfaction from myself.  I've got nothing against Justin Long as a person, but his character Warren Parker Cheswick on the television series `Ed' was just so darn annoying.  The story is pretty formulaic in terms of a rag tag bunch of misfits rising above their own inadequacies to achieve a common goal, facing impossible odds and adversity every step of the way, but the difference is the various interesting characters.  I thought all the actors did really well, but Stiller kinda needs to find a new schtick as I feel like I've seen his psycho, over-the-top characterization a number of times, with small variances.  I actually like him better when he's downplaying his roles in a self-effacing manner as in There's Something About Mary (1998) or Meet the Parents (2000)...yeah, his character did get a little nutso in those movies, but it was brief, and within context, and worked better in small doses.  I've never been a huge fan of Vaughn, ever since he appeared in that remake of Psycho (1998), but he fit in nicely here as the sort of smart alecky leader and wasn't relied on to carry the film as he got a lot of help from a good supporting cast.  The direction was good, as Thurber kept things moving along at a good pace, although the film did slow down a bit in the third act, despite all the scenes of intense competition in terms of teams battling to get into the finals.  In one of the commentaries, Thurber stated he actually left the film for a week, as the studio didn't like his original ending, which is included as a special feature.  I saw it, and thought it was better than the one used, and I can only imagine the reactions of those who attended pre-screening...oh well, I guess you really can't fight the power.  At least we get to see Christine Taylor kiss another woman, and that's gotta be worth something.  Some of my favorite scenes involved the training tactics used by Rip Torn's character (""If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball.""), which involved the scene, as I mentioned earlier, of Justin Long's character's face having an unfriendly encounter with a tool.  All in all this was a pretty silly movie, but highly entertaining, especially if you like to see guys hit in the crotch with large, rubber balls (I know I do).

The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks sharp, and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through clearly.  Special features include a commentary track with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and director-writer Rawson Marshall Thurber, nine deleted/extended scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary by writer/director Thurber, footage (with introduction by Thurber) of the Dodgeball Dancers (Yowsa!), some entertaining featurettes titled `Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball',  `The Anatomy of a Hit', `Justin Long: A Study in Ham & Cheese', `Dodgeball: Go for the Gold', a blooper/gag reel, 2 theatrical trailers for the film, along with ones for Garden State (2004), and There's Something About Mary (1998), the screenplay on DVD-ROM, and a few, easy to find Easter eggs featuring Stiller in a fat suit poking fun at those who scour DVDs for hidden features.

Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one.  I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.

The plot in this movie doesn't matter much.  No one cares about it.  This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs.  Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin.  There's a whole variety of goofy humor.  My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.

Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though.  There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all.  I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie.  Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.

I am a big Ben Stiller fan and I also like Vince Vaughn. So, I had some big expectations before watching this movie. While it does have a fair share of laughs, it just wasn't very funny. The movie is about Average Joes Gym, a gym that needs 50,000 dollars to keep the building. So, Vince Vaughn and company form a dodgeball team and enter into a dodgeball tournament to get the money. But, squaring off against them are the people from the popular Globo Gym. They square off in a funny tournament on ESpN 8, the ocho. Vaughn and Stiller are good as are the rest of the cast but this movie wasn't as funny as it could have been.

I mean, hey, I loved dodgeball as a kid and some of the movie trailers looked entertaining, but this movie, probably all courtesy of the freak Ben Stiller (who has his entertaining moments), was so laden with profanity, sexual innuendo, and filth that we ended up fast-forwarding through several scenes.

Sure it was entertaining in parts. Who doesn't think seeing someone laid out with a wrench or a big red rubber ball isn't funny?? Sure the David vs. Goliath moral of the story is great and heartwarming to see them win, but hey were the inflatable ""cup"", the S&M uniforms, the crude references to bodily functions, sex, etc. really necessary? Oh, and the girl/girl kiss with Christine Taylor(Kate) and her ""girlfriend"" was just down right repulsive.

1514013,4,B00005JMYF,"Getting hit in the face with a ball isn't funny, but watching someone else get hit in the face is. Welcome to ""Dodgeball,"" a self-aware summer comedy that aims low and hits hard. Surprisingly, ""Dodgeball"" manages to nail most of its targets, leaving them red-faced and bruised.

Anyone who endured the barbaric grade school sport of ""Dodgeball"" will understand and appreciate this underdog tale about a small time gym owner looking for salvation from bankruptcy by entering a rag tag team of losers in the National Dodgeball Championships.

Writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber readily admits he's skewering underdog sports movies in general, which explains the over-exaggerated obviousness of the characters and their dilemma. What Thurber fails to take into consideration is that underdog sports movies in general are pretty lame, some so bad they actually become parodies of themselves.

Poking fun at these type of films is risky, but Thurber manages to make ""Dodgeball"" a harmless excuse to waste an hour-and-a-half without feeling too guilty. His characters are as thin as rice paper, which allows the actors to break through and make them their own. Vince Vaughn is hilariously understated as ""Average Joe Gym"" owner Peter Le Fleur, whose client list includes a small group of misfits who call the decaying building home.

Ben Stiller, with perfectly coifed hair as big as his inflatable cod piece, is exuberantly clueless as White Goodman, a former fatty who now owns the high-tech gym across the street from Average Joe. Intent on turning his competition into a parking structure, Goodman buys out the gym's second mortgage and calls in the loan. With only thirty days to raise $50,000 or lose their haunt, La Fleur and his members decide to enter and win the National Dodgeball Championships in Las Vegas.

Not if Goodman has anything to do with it, who then recruits his own team of ringers to put La Fleur permanently out of business. Once La Fleur and his team are on the road to success, their wins come fast and furious, taking out one adverse team after another. Thurber wisely whisks through these tournaments because he knows that we know ""Dodgeball"" doesn't work unless the underdogs win and make it to Las Vegas.

Thurber also throws every underdog sports movie cliche in the book at the screen. Some work, some don't, but there are enough laughs to accommodate anyone with an interest in seeing a movie called ""Dodgeball.""",1117584000,,2446,5.027160493827161
1514014,3,B00005JMYF,"My husband & I rented this movie, and since it's rated PG-13 we thought we should watch it before the kids got ahold of it, and I'm sure glad we did.  We laughed a lot, thought it was cute, and we both really like Ben Stiller, but pretty much from the beginning we decided we weren't letting our 13 & 11 yr olds watch it.  Personally, we wouldn't let anyone under 15 watch it.  There's far too much sexual innuendo, crude humor, foul language.  My husband & I are definitely not prudes, but we certainly don't want our kids exposed to stuff like when the Average Joe's team is forced to wear S&M costumes, when Ben Stiller's character gets turned on & starts, ummm..., ""massaging"" himself with a slice of pizza, or the scene at the end with the girl-girl kissing!  Just not stuff we think young kids should see.

If you're an adult and enjoy some great slap-stik (and can handle your own flashbacks to the pain of dodgeball on the playground), and plain old sillyness, then this would be a great weekend rental.

The plot is pretty simple and straight forward. I was very pleased to see in the cast of characters, for they are real characters, some alumni from the movie, Office Space, another film about regular folks trying to forge a way through life. The supporting actors were superb, except for one exception. I didn't like Vince Vaughn's performance in this movie, which consisted more of giving ""pep-talk"" lines rather than acting.  He appeared more to me as a slick businesssman than a ""regular Joe,"" trying to keep his gym afloat. He's also too much of a pretty boy to play the ""average Joe"" role...

1514017,4,B00005JMYF,"You find no subtlety here, and you shouldn't try to.  Here is the a comedy with lots of ultimately crude, rude, unsophisticated gags.  But I like 'Dodgeball' because of that, and if you love kind of a comedy like 'There's Something About Mary,' this film is for you.

Story?  It's about a bunch of underdogs who need money very badly.  So they join in the national dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas to get $50,000.  That's it, and they form a ragtag team called 'Average Joes' while another team attempt to crush them, called 'Purple Cobras.'

Vince Vaughn, cast against type, plays the reluctant leader of 'Joes' and Ben Stiller plays the greedy gym owner named 'White Goodman.'  Add to them, Christine Taylor (Ben's real-life wife) joins in the cast as the lawyer who is sexually harassed by Mr. Goodman.  Is there any depth, subtle touch, or social message?  But should there be any?

[SLAPSTICKS AND CAMEOS] Rip Torn's funny dodgeball coach says, 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.'  Right?  In fact, red rubber balls fly around and hit the characters in the face.  The traditional slapstick comedy like pie-throwing is done in another style, with more energy and vitality, with lots of raucous humor.  Dirty languages abound, and the gags are often very sexual.  Plus, you see many cameos -- William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Hank Azaria, David Hasselhoff (as German coach), and Lance Armstrong -- all of them adding more unexpected humor to the film.

I don't say this is the best comedy of the decade, but it is true I enjoyed watching the film very much.  Silly, to be sure, but sometimes, just sometimes, absolute silliness with unstoppable energy produces a hilarious comedy like this.

So imagine my surprise when, about a third of the way through, I'm laughing so hard I can barely breathe. Rip Torn's portrayal of a former dodgeball champ now in a wheelchair training the highly untrainable ""Average Joe's"" dodgeball team absolutely stole the show. That's what Rip Torn usually does anyway. His characters always bring something to the screen and add that undefinable *something*.

Vince Vaughn was believable as the lazy owner of a very less than average gym. His gym is about to be taken from him, the power in his house is about to be turned off, and he needs to raise $50,000. So they enter a Dodgeball tournament.

We've seen this before. Entering tournaments to win much needed money for whatever cause has been done ad nausem. This film, with Vince Vaughn's quite complacence, Christine Taylor's solid comedic turns, it worked more than most of those old formulaic films.

And while I hate to say it - and I'm sure this will garner me plenty of ""not helpful"" votes - Ben Stiller, as an actor, was the worst part of the film. I completely understand that as the owner of the over-the-top gym his character needed to be over-the-top as well, but it was overkill. Neither myself nor my roommate laughed at his ridiculousness. We did laugh, however, at other scenes in which Stiller wasn't involved. He just didn't fit the character.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out. Luckily, I never had the chance, because Ben Stiller's (...). When I saw it on DVD, I was far from disappointed. I was disgusted! If I recorded a game of dodgeball during gym class, this would be better than this piece of crap. Besides, who likes the game dodgeball?

1514130,3,B00005JMYF,"DODGEBALL follows the same basic plot as SISTER ACT II: do something unusual to raise the cash to allow us to stay where we are.

It has its moments -- I enjoyed the pastiche black-and-white educational short to tell us the rules and origins of dodgeball. I also liked the second team that Average Joe's met in Las Vegas -- far more interested in striking a pose than in playing a decent game, and wearing tracksuits that were far too spacious -- but they were on for less than a minute.  The second, ultra-dumb commentator was also fun for a while.

The rest of it is predictable stuff, and there's not a single original joke in there. Both SPINAL TAP and MORE BAD NEWS have done the inflated penis gag, I'm afraid, guys.

But it's an enjoyable, if mindless, way to spend 90 minutes. Probably one for rental rather than purchase.

It's sad to see Ben Stiller become an overacting film destroyer, but you can't blame this one on him. Even Vince Vaughn seemed awkward in this terrible movie, like he knew each line he delivered was worse than the previous one. Awful and horrible. I knew someone who was on a plane that showed this movie and she cimbed into the overhead compartment for the rest of the ride.

When it came out in theatres, I thought ""A movie about Dodgeball?  How stupid is that?""  I was very wrong.

If you like Ben Stiller (which I do) I don't have to say anything.  He is extremely funny and plays his role perfectly.

To me; however, Vince Vaughn steals the show.  I don't know exactly what it is, but I could swear that he ad-libs half of his lines.  The character is almost ""too real"".

The supporting cast (especially the lovely Christine Taylor) is absolutely perfect.  I am not going to babble on about how great the movie is because a long review is boring.  I will simply say that when I watch this movie, I feel like I am ""in it.""  By the way...the cameo appearances are priceless.  Ben Stiller seems to be able to talk anyone into doing anything.",1107907200,2,938,4.4035087719298245
1514133,3,B00005JMYF,"I think when you walk into a movie theater to see a Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn comedy about professional dodge ball, expectations should probably be lowered. Odds are you all ready know the plot, a big business gym run by the ego maniac Stiller wants to take over the run down gym next door. A gym run by goofy, but nice salt of the earth kind of guys. You know there's a good chance that they'll be a love interest and she comes in the form of Christine Taylor, a cute but no nonsense banker who's indirectly helping Stiller foreclose on the goofy guy's gym. Vaughn, owner of said gym, needs $50,000 to stay solvent and keep his place but there's no way he can get that kind of...oh...but wait a minute... he and his employees could enter the local dodge ball tournament which eventually leads to Las Vegas and, you guessed it, a $50,000 grand prize. It's the perfect plan, but, oh no, Stiller and his thugs have entered the tournament too and the Average Joe's (the name of Vaughn's team) may be in trouble. Odds are you can guess how it ends.

So we don't see these movies for the plots, we go to them for the jokes and Dodgeball has its share of funny and even laugh out load moments. Stiller's over the top performance is typical Stiller, but he's one of the few comic actors today that can pull off such a performance with out looking silly. Vaughn pretty much recreates his role from ""Old School"" while supporting roles and guest appearances by Rip Torn, Gary Cole, Hank Azaria, and Jason Bateman keep the action moving.

My first problem with the film is that it takes some wrong comic turns. Alan Tudyk seems wasted as a guy who thinks he's a pirate, that's the joke...he thinks he's a pirate. When the team HAS to ware leather bondage uniforms for their first Las Vegas match, Joel Moore wears a gag bar in his mouth. Why? No real reason except it's suppose to look funny. There's also lots of ""ball"" (i.e. testicle) jokes, because testicle and ball mean the same thing and that's funny.  The second problem is that this movie rips off its idea and look from the very underrated BASEketball. Where Trey Parker and Matt Stone grossed out their audience perhaps a bit too much BASEketball, the idea was original and sound. It also seemed a lot funnier the first time around.",1107734400,,2284,4.47242206235012
1514134,1,B00005JMYF,"This movie is horrible.  I saw it at a matinee because it was doing really well at the box office and I figured if a lot of people were going to see it that it must be pretty funny.  Well, that was wrong; this movie was very, very stupid and I didn't laugh once.  I would rather spend 90 minutes cleaning the bathroom or reading the dictionary - you get the idea.  Don't waste your time.  If you're stubborn, then rent it before you buy it so you can see for yourself how stupid this movie is.  Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are funny guys, but this movie is like a paint by numbers (done by someone with shaky hands).",1107648000,,617,4.1
1514163,2,B00005JMYF,"Dodge ball is the kind of movie you have seen a thousand times about a guy trying to save something for him and hid friends and they happen to figure out a way how to do it that would never really happen in real life, but you know it will in the end of the film, because it's a movie.

What's-his-face plays this guy who owns a gymnasium that needs $50,000 to keep his gym, other wise it will be repossessed (or something like that) by the bank. So they try to think up a way to get the fifty grand with a few weeks by any means necessary (legally). They decide they will enter the Dodge Ball competition where the grand final prize money is (wait for it, you'll never guess) fifty thousand dollars!!! Their rival team is Ben Stiller's annoying character who owns a much more stable and wealthier gym who has bought off the first mortgage of Joes gym and plans to turn Joes gym into a car park for his gym that happens to be right across the street. Will Joe get to the final and win the 50k? Or will Global Gym beat them and take over? I wonder???

Ben Stiller is not an actor I hate, I did like him in ""Something about Mary"" so don't get me wrong when I say he is the downfall of this film. He plays an extra stupid fitness buff who owns a major gym. But his character is not funny, and his acting is extremely annoying. To set up a character for the audience to hate is ok, but to make them annoyed and wish he would just get off the screen is another. There is a difference between a villain and bad acting.

This movie didn't seem to know which direction it wanted to go in with its approach to comedy in my opinion. Some of it seemed like it was trying to go for average family comedy or kids movie, other parts it would go for the smutty comedy approach, and then in-between here and there where bits of attempted wacky and goofy comedy like a slap stick kind of think. Those elements can work well together, but this new 1st time producer, whoever he is, needs to work out how to blend them properly or never get it right. It's kind of like a kid's first time out drinking booze, instead of sipping something light; he's grabbed everything from the top shelf and mixed a regretting combination. But one day he might learn to not mix his drinks. That's because this movie had potential to be absolutely hilarious, but it failed with the wrong ideas and jokes and didn't come out the way it could have been.

The extra features are nothing to look forward to. The out-takes aren't funny, (except David Hasslehoff's, that made me laugh) the deleted scenes are pretty boring, the featurettes are slightly amusing in some parts. The alternate ending is ...eh. The commentary was buggered up because it actualy had JOKE COMMANTARY written on the back of the case. (2 thing's, don't write that it's a joke, it reuins it, and don't tell people there are eggs on the DVD, it's reuins the fact that there supposed to be hidden extras.. oh and 3, make the eggs worth looking at)but knowing it was a joke rueined the thing that I knew was an attempted false audio commantary to make you laugh,well it failed anyway, not much is funny about them arguing and pretending to hate each other and rustling chip packets and drinking beer, might have worked if they didn't write it was a joke on the case already before you've seen it. but then halfway through they decide to play the audio commantary from 'something about mary' which is stupid to do from the 40 minute mark to the very end of the credits, it did become quite boring after the 1st 10 minutes of listning to that half of it. There is a hidden audio commentary in the commentary selection screen if you press right on one of the options and you get to listen to the REAL commantary (WHY HIDE A COMMENTARY TRACK?). Still, there boring. The hidden eggs aren't worth looking at either.

Dodge Ball failed to find it's mark because I had a hard time trying to figure out what kind of comedy it was supposed to be? Slapstick? Family? Smutty? or a Kids Comedy? But I could not just sit back and enjoy the film either, too much of it just didn't hit the right mark and was pretty cheap attempts at humour. Surprisingly tho it didn't contain a fart joke anywhere in the movie!!! The movie really needed to finish what it began with certain character elements and little things here and there. I'd recommend you watch BASEketball instead, yeah, watch the movie that this one tried to be in some ways.

The movie has no lasting quality. I laughed at a few things the 1st time around. But on the second time around it was pretty stale. Ben Stiller's performance is very hard for me to watch. The humour doesn't last. It could have been such a better movie then it is. The bonus features are a snore fest. Cameos do not save the film, the movie might be a clich of sports and to itself, but it's a ""seen it before"" movie. You have seen the basic element of this movies story line 1000 times. There is probably 2 lines in the whole movie I liked `cause I though they where funny and original, but not lasting or classic comedy.

Thumbs down, but to say something good about the film, least it was better then a lot of the other junk released last year.

And pretty much everyone I know whose seen this has the same reveiw as me... ""I did not like the movie, but I loved the line Rip Torn said"" so on that note let me say that this DVD is a iseless as a C*** flavoured lollypop.",1107648000,,5418,4.299706170421156

I love that this movie has Milton and Bill Lumbergh from Office Space in it.  Other appearances in this movie are made by:

- Jason Bateman (he plays the Dodgeball commentator on ESPN 8: ""The Ocho"" along w/ Lumbergh)

- William Shatner (he plays the Dodgeball Chancellor)

- Lance Armstrong (appears in a funny scene w/ Vince Vaughn right after Vaughn decides to quit Average Joe's)

- David Hasselhoff (gets worshipped by this team of German players)

- Chuck Norris (plays a judge who casts the deciding vote to allow Vince Vaughn to rejoin his team after they forfit).

Rip Torn is really funny in this movie - he plays Patches O'Houlihan - a famous Dodgeball player who in now confined to a wheelchair, but decides to coach Average Joe's.  He trains the players on Average Joe's by getting them to dodge wrenches, cars, etc.  Very funny stuff.",1107216000,,1070,4.487046632124352

1514167,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball is a fun and entertaining film that pits two business associates against each other in a battle for respect and survival. Ben Stiller is the egocentric, cocky White Goodman and Vince Vaughan plays his rival, Peter. Both men own physical health centers, but Peter's is in financial trouble and needs a way to make a large sum of money quickly. Peter and his employees decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas with the hope of winning the championship and the necessary money to stay in business. Goodman hears about this and he enters his own team to challenge them.

The formula and plot for this movie may seem a little hokey at first. But the movie works for several reasons. First of all, there is the fine cast of characters and diversity of personalities. Vaughn's character is soft spoken and friendly, but also non- expressive and basically an underachiever- the mirror opposite of the arrogant character played by Ben Stiller. Rip Torn is also excellent as the coach for Vaughn's team. His character, Peaches O'Houlihan, is confined to a wheelchair but he doesn't let this stop him from doing what he does best: coaching and motivating his team in a most unorthodox and often hysterical way. And Gary Cole and Jason Bateman add some good laughs as the sportscasters for ""ESPN 8: The Ocho"", which is covering the dodgeball event.

Cameo appearances by Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and others add to the many surprises in this film. And even though the movie is mostly predictable, as a viewer, you really won't mind. There is enough fun along the way to make the ride enjoyable regardless.

Dodgeball is, in summary, a fast- moving, fun, entertaining, and mostly predictable film that is humorous and enjoyable from beginning to end. The director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, and the fine cast deserve credit for taking what initially seems like a stupid, ""B"" comedy and turning it into a compelling, witty, and entertaining motion picture film.",1106870400,2,1974,4.921921921921922
1514168,3,B00005JMYF,"I think that you really do have to have seen this film on DVD to appreciate it, as there is alot in it that tends to escape the eye on the first viewing. Yes, it is a silly movie full of tiresome and painful slapstick, but there is a rather cynical side to the director that puts him a little above your average  director of dumb comedy. I would recommend watching the alternate ending and commentary on the DVD to see what i mean-it seems he fought fairly hard for a less predictable ending but gave up. What really puts this in prespective though is to watch the movie again and notice all the little touches that seem to make fun of the obviousness of the ending of the film that was seen in cinemas-notice, for instance, that the treasure chest that Vaughn wins actually has the words ""deus ex machina"" labelled upon it. It is actually pretty annoying that the alternate ending was not used, as this could have added a real twist to the film, without ruining the original outcome i.e. having Vaughn lose and than finding he used Globo Gym's money in betting against his team. Nonetheless, there's also a lot more goodies included throughout the film for those with an observant eye and patience, including a gust appearance by William Shatner (that man is addicted to guest appearances) and a memorably disturbing little skit at the end of the film after the credits-I won't give away too much, but let us just say that it involves Ben Stiller...enough said! Anyway, just watch closely for these little touches (I know it's hard after those endless mind-numbing scenes of balls hitting people that get put everywhere throughout the film) and you just might enjoy this movie.",1106697600,,1678,4.630872483221476

The owners of Average joes are forced to earn fifty thousand dollars or face losing the gym they take up dodge ball not even knowing how to play, to counter this Stiller sets up his own extremely fit athletic team in order to stop them.

This movie is extremely funny it adds a lot of childish humour like there are about 50 shots of people getting hit in the balls, the charaters are witty and the humerous lines ans scenes are really quite random. This movie was set up souly for the pupose of making you laugh and entertained so don't go expecting a great, original story because you will be greatly dissapointed.

1514170,3,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball is nothing new when it comes to its plot.  It's been one of the most commonly used plots over the past 25 years or so with movies like The Bad News Bears, Major League, Mighty Ducks, and Necessary Roughness.  Basically a group of losers comes together to win the big game and save the day.  In this case Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns a run down old gym called ""Average Joes"".  He's behind on all his bills and hasn't collected membership dues in over a year.  He needs to come up with $50,000 in a month to save the gym from being taken over by his rival across the street Globo Gym.

Globo Gym is run by White Goodman (Stiller) a blow-dryer headed, Tony Little-like obnoxious egomaniac.  The bank brings in a tax attorney kate (Christine Taylor) to go over Average Joe's financial records and to fight off the sleazy Goodman who is constantly hitting on her.

To save the Gym, Peter and his rag-tag group of gym misfits decide to enter a dodgeball tournament where the top prize is, of course, $50,000.  Problem is the group has no idea how to play the game and little talent until an ancient doggeball coach, Patches O'hoolihan (Rip Torn) comes in as their mentor.  Well you can pretty much guess the story from here, Right?  No need for me to play spoiler.

Despite its forula script, Dodgeball has some funny scenes involving its crew of misfit players.  Such as when they try and raise the money by having a car wash...we cut to a scene of gorgeous women in bikinis getting all wet and soapy and a long line of cars waiting...trouble is...that this is across the street and Average Joe's ""All male"" car wash has only one customer, a big, redneck who keeps paying the young Justin to wash his pickup over and over again.

Stiller plays his role way over the top as a dimwitted diet and workout guru similar to the people you see on late night infomercials.  Stepehen Root plays Gordon, a whipped nebbish type not too unlike the role he played in Office Space.  Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are absoultely hilarious as the broadcast team for ""ESPN 8"".

Dodgeball breaks no new ground but it doesn't try to.  You know going in exactly what's going to happen in the end because it always happens the same way in these movies.  But it's a fairly funny ride to get there with some enjoyably screwy performances from Stiller, Root, Cole, and Bateman.

It started out as semi-ridiculous camp and appeared to be a rehash of Zoolander with Stiller playing another outrageous goofball character.  I also could not buy Vince Vaughn as a broken loser.  No matter what he wears or drives, it's hard not to imagine him being a stud. Yet, overall it was pretty funny.

Some of the situational and physical humor was hilarious.  The ""all male carwash"" was a classic and the movie's highlight may have been a 1930s mock documentary, produced for school children, about dodgeball.  When Vince Vaughn tells a girl scout, ""you were adopted and your parents don't love you"" I fell apart.  Another awesome line is when he confesses that ""when you don't have any goals in life you are never disappointed."" Other typical one liners are Rip Torn saying ""that dyke can play"" and Vaughn's ""put your mouth where our balls are.""  Torn has a ton of excellent lines and it was hard not to laugh out loud at the sight of their team's S&M uniforms.

1514213,4,B00005JMYF,"Just like Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, I was afraid to waste any money watching it fearing that it so dumb it's not funny period type of flick. Luckily, I was proven wrong. Ben Stiller is White Goodman, a cocky, wealthy and heavily built owner of the hottest gym going. Vince Vaughn is Peter LaFleur, the owner of Average Joe's gym which is old, worn out and in finanical debt to its ears. White and Peter have different philosophy as it relates to human conditioning and outlooks on life. White feels if you're not buff or in shape, you're a loser. Peter is for everyone regardless of what shape their in.

The bank gives Peter a notice that the gym is about to be foreclosed if he does not come up with $50,000. If peter fails to come up with this money, White will use the gym to add on to his gym. Peter and his crew try desperately to come up with strageties to make the money, but fall flat each time until one of the guys encouraged the group to get involved in a dodgeball competition. Of course, Peter is pretty much the only guy on the team that has any athletic abilities. In fact the team was so bad that they got schooled by a girl scout's team in order to qualify for the touranment but the girls got disqualified b/c one of the girls failed a drug test. Go Figure. Luckily, the team did get some help as a coach (Rip Torn) comes and shows them the ropes on how to play the game. Of course, that took many, many practices to even get them even close to being competitive.  The coach used wrenches and screwdrivers to as ball to help them practice.  Obvisously, you would want to be good enough to dodge these things or else you'll be in some serious pain. In addition, the woman who entered Average Joe's gym to give him his notice joined the team b/c she hated White just as bad as he did and was you would expect, Average Joe's overcame the odds to advance in the finals of the tourament. However, their cinderalla story was in some serious jeporady. The coach gets killed in a casino, some of the team members had priorities elsewhere, and White strongly encouraged Peter a deal he couldn't refuse in selling his gym. However, against all odds the team did prevail, keep the gym, and run White's gym out of business. White ends up the guy that he thought was a complete loser as he sat in his sofa eating a pound of ice cream grieveing over the loss.  Highly Recommended.",1106352000,,2396,4.317777777777778

1514218,4,B00005JMYF,"I've read some of the reviews on this movie, and I think some of the people who say this movie isn't funny lack a sense of humor.  I first saw this movie in the theatre, I laughed all the way through it, along with the rest of the sold out cinema.  And when I watch it by myself at my house or with some people, I'll still laugh at some of its jokes.

Probably the only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it was kind of short (85 minutes or so), and the storyline was incredibly fast-paced.  Anyways, there's two main characters in the movie.  First, there is Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaugn, ""Old School,"" ""Anchorman"") who is the owner of Average Joe's Gym, a run-down gym that is about to be shut down due to failed mortage payments and bought out by Peter's arch enemy, White Goodman (Ben Stiller).  White is the owner of Globo Gym, a state-of-the-art complex located right across the street from Average Joe's.  In order to keep Average Joe's Gym in business and out of the clutches of Globo Gym, Peter has to raise $50,000 dollars in 30 days.  After failed attempts to raise money, they decide to participate in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas, which happens to have a $50,000 grand prize awarded to the winner.  In response, Globo Gym forms their own dodgeball team, to try and prevent Average Joe's from winning the money.

That's pretty much it for the story itself.  And again, the story moves very quickly, but fortunately the cast is able to keep the laughs constantly coming.  The cast also includes a big set of on-camera cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff, Hank Azaria, and Lance Armstrong.  The DVD also comes packed with bonus features.  I was surprised that they didn't have some of the deleted scenes in the actual movie, because they're pretty funny and the movie short enough as it is.  This may not be the best movie out there, but I bet Steven Spielberg crapped his pants when his movie, ""The Terminal,"" got destroyed by Dodgeball at the box office in the first weekend.  It's worth a look!",1105315200,,2044,4.528610354223433
1514219,2,B00005JMYF,"Dodgball has the formula to be a classic.  What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls?  But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had.  Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly.  Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life.  When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.

Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver.  When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less.  I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure.

Vaughn is so stiff in this movie and Stiller is such a (...)that I liked nothing about each of their characters. Christine Taylor(Zoolander, Campfire Tales) plays on Vaughn's team (Taylor is Stiller's reallife wife). Other actors in the movie are the following: Hank Azaria (Along Came Polly, Heat) plays young Patches O'Hoolahan and Rip Torn (Welcome To Mooseport, MEn In Black 1 and 2) plays older crippled PAtches O'Hoolahan. Alan Tudyk(Hearts In Atlantis, A Knight's Tale) plays Pete The Pirate.

Raunchy and really boring which makes this movie very dumb to watch and listen too. I really wanted to leave the theatre while watching this movie, I truly did.

1514290,5,B00005JMYF,"I laughed so hard at Ben Stiller during this whole movie.  He  was great. The whole movie is hilarious from beginning to end. Ben Stiller plays Dwight Goodman and ego maniac who is in love with himself. He is the owner and operator of  Globogym which looks like a gym we'd see the year 2040. Now there are problems at Peter LaFluers' Average Joes Gym which is right across the street from Globogym.  They are behind in their payments and need 50,000 dollars or Dwight will buy their gym.

Peter LaFluers gyms consists of all emotionally crippled in some way members who work for him.  Peter will do anything to help them or make them happy.  This is the only place they go to find solitude from their unhappy lives. For them being able to go Average Joes Gym and just being there makes them happy.  Peter sees this and  doesn't want to lose Average Joes to Dwight. They finally agree to play Dodgeball because this is there only way of winning 50,000 dollars.  After beating one team they enter the finals. Dwight sees this and also enters the finals.

Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn overhears Peters members in a bar being bullied by non other than Dwight himself. Dwights is tring to scare them out of not going to the finals. Patches see this and  decides to coach their team on how to play Dodgeball . Patches coaching starts off in a more violent way which makes for some really funny scenes. There are also hilarious moments where Ben Stiller tries to pick up Christine Taylor in all grotesque perverted ways. Watch Stiller talk during most of the movie he doesn't make any sense and its so funny.

Both teams finally go to the dodgedball competition in Las Vegas to see if they can win and Stiller will do anything to stop that from happening by getting really violent. The other cast was funny too but Ben Stiller was definately at the top. Vince Vaughn was good too and played a very lovable character. There are some good cameos in this movie by David Haselhoff, Chuck Norris, Lance Armtrsong, Jason Bateman, Gary Cole, and William Shatner  Please see this movie, it is very entertaining and funny to watch.  I highley recommend it!!",1105056000,2,2150,4.5625
1514291,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodge Ball is a truly funny movie.  The setting is Ben Stiller is the leader of a super swanky exercise center and Vince Vaughn is the leader of the exercise center for misfits.  Vaughn is losing his center to the bank for non-payment and Ben stiller's charater has bought the mortgage.  Vaughn leads his crew in a dodge ball tournament to win $50,000 to pay off the mortgage and keep his center for the average Joes.  Stiller sets his own team up to prevent the Average Joes from winning due to his personal hatered for Vaughn.

Ben Stiller is perfect as the over the top fitness guru White Goodman.  He represents every fitness guru the average person hates.  Too muscular with perfect hair and perfect physical specimens surrounding him.  Think of all of those workout specialist selling various equipment and tapes on late night tv.  He is too macho for his own good and he is tiny to boot, using intimidation to get what he wants.

Vaughn is also perfect as LeFleur the leader of the average Joes.  He leads a bunch of nerds trying, but not succeeding to work out.  He represent everyone of us who starts to work out but never finishes.  He buys the tape but nerver uses it more than once.  He also fails to see why he is less than the experts and thinks its ok to be average.

Rip Torn is the ""famous"" patches o'toole, a champion dodge ball player from the fifties trying to get the average joes ready to win.

There is nothing new in this movie that has not been covered better before.  But, don't let that stop you from buying this one.  It is the combinations of the cliches that make this movie so hysterical.  With allusions to the famous fitness gurus to the ""karate kid"", the movie actually works.  I thought the idea of championship dodge ball was so over the top until I saw championship dodge ball on a famous cable sports channel.

I guess there's room for a third, Education, but I think even most documentaries are meant as a form of Art.  Anyway, this movie is pure entertainment at its best, the same way Action movies like Terminator or The Rundown are, whereas Alien or Gladiator have more of an artsy edge.

Of course this movie is kind of stupid.  Its not much on plot--its a classic story of the little nerdy guy Vs. the big bad cool bad guy, although the cool bad guy in this movie is actually kind of a homo-erotic, quasi-retard who is extremly shallow, and the good guy isn't really a nerd, just an ""Average Joe"" who has a shot to make it big and is willing, although rather reluctantly, to go the distance.  When ya get right down to the nuts and bolts, this movie is full of hilarious crude little jabs that make ya laugh a little here and there, and enough comedic right-hooks that will leave you laughing your @$$ off.  Its Hollywood, thats for damn sure, so don't go expecting anything smart or wicked.

When White Goodman(ben stiller) hears about this, he decides to play dodgeball too, to make sure that the average joes don't win.  It's just really funny, SO YOU BETTER GET IT STINKY!!

1514296,4,B00005JMYF,"Let's face it, dodgeball is a ridiculous sport. This raises an important (well, not really) question-can it even be called a sport? On the surface, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story seems to say yes but in actuality it is an accurate parody of this silly activity that one used to play as a child in gym class. Now, it is televised and played by ""professionals."" It's time to take this ridiculous enterprise down a notch.

The attention to details is a part of what makes this such a funny movie. There is the skewering of the many ESPN TV channels as the tournament is shown on ESPN 8 (their slogan is ""If it's almost a sport we've got it here.""). The two sports commentators are played with gusto by Gary Cole and Jason Bateman who gleefully spout many funny, off-the-cuff comments that make fun of these kinds of broadcasters.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Thurber mentions that he wrote the roles specifically for Stiller, Vaughn and Justin Long. Stiller and Vaughn comment on scenes with dry, sardonic humour while Thurber plays the straight man.

There are seven deleted scenes with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that they were cut for time and pacing. There is some good footage here, including more with Justin (Long) and his dream of being a cheerleader.

Also included is a more downbeat alternate ending with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that test audiences didn't like it and the studio forced him to re-shoot it, even leaving the production for ten days in protest. This is a rare insight into a problem that he ran into in an otherwise congratulatory collection of extras.

""Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball"" features footage of the cast training for the dodgeball sequences. Interestingly, they all had to learn how to dodge and throw the ball like professional dodgeballers.

""The Anatomy of a Hit"" examines why physical humour is so funny. Thurber explains that the tendency for an actor is to flinch before you're hit by an object.

""Justin Long: A Study in Ham and Cheese"" features a scene with the actor adlibbing as he mentally prepares himself for dodgeball followed by a montage of many ball hits that he endured for a scene.

""Dodgeball: Go for the Gold"" has Stiller and Vaughn making a mock-plea for dodgeball to be considered as an Olympic sport.

There is the obligatory blooper/gag reel that features the usual blown lines and, not surprisingly, some of the nasty hits that the camera took from well-placed dodgeball throws by Stiller.

Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.

Dodgeball lives up to its subtitle by being a much better movie than it should have been. Sure, there is the requisite crude humour (gratuitous ball shots to the groin) but also right on the money parodies of fitness clubs and the fascination with sports that have no business being called such. Dodgeball is mindless entertainment but done in an engaging way that is a lot of fun to watch.",1104796800,,3027,4.858252427184466

The movie really has no point, but if you are looking for a good movie to sit down to and get a good laugh, I recommend you take a good look at this movie.

And for people who like a little bit of information on the plot, here you go:

The movie starts off when Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller have competing gymnasiums built right across the street from eachother.  Vince doesnt pay his mortgage so the bank threatens to shut his gym down if he doesnt come up with $50,000 in a month.  He almost gives up getting the money until one of the loyal gym patrons finds a magazine add advertising the American Dodgeball Association of America dodgeball tournament.  (Yes, it is the adaa, not a typo.)  The winning prize is $50,000.  I am going to skip the rest because if you like what you have read you will like the movie.  The ending is quite unexpected as well, and is very good.

There's nothing particularly clever or new here.  Go ahead and screen this movie at your party.  It will get a lot of laughs.  But this is certainly no classic.  After seeing Stiller's ""Envy,"" I thought that this would be a big step up.  But it really wasn't.  This movie really just seems to go through the motions of every recent silly sports flick.

1514396,3,B00005JMYF,"So, here is a silly and vulgar piece of fluff that has some moments that are quite funny.  Vince Vaughn is the broke and nearly ruined Peter Le Fleur, owner of Average Joes Gym, and Ben Stiller is the beyond creepy White Goodman, maniac owner of the successful Globo Gym which is right across the street from the failing Average Joes.  White has taken advantage of Peter's defaulting on his second mortgage to get his paws on Average Joes Gym to tear it down to expand his parking.  Of course, Peter has 30 days to come up with the fifty grand to stay the foreclosure and death of his moribund gym.

Steven Root plays Gordon, one of the loveable losers whose non-life revolves around Average Joes.  Gordon reads Obscure Sports Monthly.  It happens they can win the $50,000 if they can win a dodgeball tournament in Vegas.  Never mind the expense or taxes, the amount has to match exactly what is needed because it doesn't really matter at all.  It is just a plot device for the silliness which ensues.

Rip Torn plays the wheelchair bound Patches O'Houlihan, the minor deity of the sport of dodgeball.  He takes on the loveable losers and trains them to win the tournament.  He offers the classic line of the movie, ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.""

1514397,3,B00005JMYF,"Sometimes, you just have to ask yourself what's funny. Is something really funny, or is not really but seems to be because of a certain action that's going on on screen?. Personally, I love a good, intelligent, sophisticated comedy, but just as much, I love the low-brow, slapstick, juvenile type. In the case of this movie, the slapstickiness and the ongoing pounding of rubber balls on human flesh is just funny in it's own right, but it takes on more meaning because it brings back memories, most of them not good, of the sport back in our school days. Thinking about the horrors of the barbaric sport in gym class and, if you were one of the unlucky ones, remembering being one of the unwilling picked on players who would just get massacred, makes the comedy here more personal. And that much more funnier. Vince Vaughan stars as Peter LaFleur, a laid back slacker type who runs his own little gym, Average Joe's. Which pretty much sums up his character. His gym is kind of slummy with some sad sack clientele. When he learns that he is in debt and owes $50,000 dollars, he must come up with a plan, or he will have to close his place, and hand it over to White Goodman(the hilariously crazy Ben Stiller), a nazi-like fitness guru with a massive gym, and just as massive hair and ego. Peter and his band of misfits learn of a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas where the first prize is, you guessed it, $50,000. What a perfect koinkidink. But who shows up?. White, of course. What we have here is a good natured, little underdog story that mostly works. It is by no means a classic, but it is a competent little comedy that is consistent in it's run and it's laughs. It also doesn't hurt that it has a very solid footing with it's good cast. Rip Torn plays their dodgeball coach, who is seen in a 1950's educational type film and is played by an uncredited Hank Azaria. There are a few other cameos here too like William Shatner, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris(who is hilariously insulted in the last scene), and David Hassellhoff. The commentators for the sport are played by the always great and welcomed Gary Cole, and the mysteriously uncredited Jason Bateman. Those two are reminiscent of Fred Willard in ""Best In Show"", and they are just as funny. The regular cast holds things up nicely too. The always reliable Stephen Root(""Office Space"", ""King Of The Hill"", ""NewsRadio"")is great here as a nerdish family man. Justin Long, from ""Ed"" and the ""Jeepers Creepers"" movies is hysterical as, well, Justin, the poor kid who seems the bear the brunt of the slamming balls and other airborn devices. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, also co-stars. And what can you say about Stiller?. He has always been very talented, and his creation of White Goodman here is hysterical. He keeps it interesting and fun when waiting to hear what dimbulb thing he is going to say next. This is a movie that is pretty funny and enjoyable on it's own, but is made so much funnier when we remember the rigors of high school gym class and are able to look back on it and laugh. Well, hopefully.",1103846400,,3087,4.5840867992766725

Ben Stiller is stand out hilarious. The scene with the pizza slice is probably one of the funniest I have seen in any goofball movie in years. Everyone involved with this movie, however, does a great job.

If you like slapstick toilet humor done right, this is the movie for you. If you are looking for ""intelligent"" comedy, role models, or morality, search elsewhere. Take this movie for what it is, and you will enjoy every silly moment of it.",1103846400,,1199,4.511520737327189

I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was pleasantly surprised. Christine Taylor does a good job, and the supporting cast was surprisingly good. Ben Stiller gets old after awhile with his way, way over-the-top performance (which is a reprise of a very similar part he played in the movie ""Heavyweights""). This isn't Vaughn's best performance, but it was still enjoyable. There isn't a great deal of plot, and what plot there is is pretty predictable, but hey, this isn't that kind of movie. It's not great stuff, but it's good enough to warrant a recommendation from me. Plus, there are a lot of extras plus a commentary track by Vaughn, Stiller, and the director, so this DVD has that going for it. Overall, a keeper.",1103760000,,836,4.617449664429531

But the main character was an unabashed [...] consumer, the main lady turned out to be someone of very poor judgement and obvious immorality, the main antagonist tried multiple times to artifically expand his male anatomy and then ended up totally fat in the end with a set of very female [...] and doing a dirty dance with them.

The theme of this movie was, ""There are no consequences in life and the road to success is luck.""

I was the really stupid one for not turning off this movie early on. I kept hoping it would end up well but I was very disappointed. I hope no one else falls into wasting time and money watching or supporting this offensive and waste of a movie.",1103673600,6,836,4.352564102564102

""Your about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop!""

- the coach for the ""Average Joe's"" gives some helpless advice in ""Dodgeball""

Vince Vaughn & Ben Stiller star in a film that has balls as big as churchbells. ""Dodgeball"" is the type of sophmoronic comedy that works along the style of ""The Bad News Bears"", and any other sports comedy, but, without the gross out gags (with the exception of the overweight Stiller scenes).

Vaughn owns ""Average Joe's Gym"", a decrepit, rundown gym that if Joe owned it, he would probably shoot himself. With most of the members not paying there monthly membership, ""Avg. Joe's"" hasn't made a penny in almost a year.

Stiller plays the owner of ""Globo-Gym"", a ""Golds Gym"" style franchise, that's preparing to buy out ""Average Joe's"" and turn the gym into a parking lot. Vaughn has thirty days to cough up fifty grand and save his gym. A plan formulates when the Joe's of the gym decide to enter into a dodgeball tournament with fifty g's as the grand prize. All bets are off when Stiller, & his ""Globo-homos"" buy there way into the tournament, planning to crush ""Average Joe's"" financially and physically.

""Dodgeball"" has plenty of laughs. Vince Vaughn is at his best (you actually root for the poor shlub). Ben Stiller is o.k. as the ""Globo"" gym owner and has enough retarded arrogance to scare off his real life wife (she's the lawyer turned dodgeball MVP who helps the ""Joe's""). Jason Bateman makes a good cameo as a burnt out announcer.

The DVD features include deleted scenes, trailers, easter eggs, and director commentary",1103673600,,1618,4.736654804270462
1514402,3,B00005JMYF,"And the award for the least subtle movie of the year goes to. . .DodgeBall.  I once read an interview with a former Hollywood screenwriter.  He said he hated that way comedies were written because they always felt it necessary to say t the audience ""Here comes the joke. Here is the joke. Ok, that was the joke."" And I never saw that concept as clearly as I did while watching this film.  It's no enough that the Christine Taylor character swoons over Vince Vaughn and seems revolted at the mere sight of Ben Stiller.  No, no, no, she needs to spell it out to the audience that she just threw up...a little...in her mouth.  Now I've had my fair share of ugly girls hit on me in my day and never once did my body reject the idea of them so thoroughly as to create vomit.  And I doubt anyone else has had that experience either, so where exactly does the comedy come from in that scene?  The film is filled with the usual teenage fare... gross out jokes, celebrity cameos, and nonsense.  Oh yeah, and a nice dose of funny jokes.  I've always thought the Stiller/Wilson/Vaughn comedies had far more integrity that those of Adam Sandler.  [...]  Still I can't recommend this film.  They pander far too much and think too little of their target audience.  Also, I felt as though this film existed in a bubble, and that it could have been made any time in the past 100 years and has nothing to say about the society we live in today. Nobody could accuse Team America of that problem.  Of course had they used the original ending in this film I could have been convinced to think differently about it.  3 out of 5",1103587200,,1606,4.342281879194631
1514403,4,B00005JMYF,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a really fun summer comedy with a hilarious cast.  Peter LaFleur's Average Joe's Gym is going to be shut down in a month by rival Globo Gym is he cannot come up with $50,000.  One of the gym members comes up with an idea how to get the money; win a $50,000 dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas and save the gym.  Globo Gym's evil owner, White Goodman, discovers their plan and enters his own team in the tournament so that he can officially put Average Joe's out of business.  The plot is pretty straightforward throughout.  The whole movie is basically an excuse to show people getting drilled by red rubber balls.  Plenty of great quotes throughout that will keep you rolling around on the ground.  Not as good as Anchorman, another summer comedy, but still well worth a watch.

  Vince Vaughn is great as the straight-faced owner of Average Joe's, Peter LaFleur.  He delivers his lines so calmly that sometimes you miss how funny he is.  Ben Stiller is great in an over-the-top part as Globo Gym owner White Goodman.  His character is so mind-numbingly stupid that he's funny.  Christine Taylor plays Kate Veatch, a bank employee who teams up with LaFleur to save the gym and beat Globo Gym.  Rip Torn steals the show as Patches O'Houlihan, a dodgeball coach from the 1950's who tries to teach LaFleur and his team how to play the sport.  LaFleur's team includes Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams, and Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, cast and crew commentary, seven deleted/extended scenes, an alternate ending that should have been used, four featurettes, a bloopers/gag reel, and six easter eggs hidden in the menus.

The supporting actors are funnier than them both in my opinion. I rented this one and I think its worth a rental but definitely not for purchase.

If you think you might enjoy 100+ minutes of guys either getting hit in the head or crotch by flying objects, this movie might very well be for you. For me, and I suspect for anyone with half a brain, it gets old pretty dang quickly.  Stiller's once promising comic acting career seems to be waning as he once agains saddles up to a role that is bound to leave teenaged boys laughing hysterically while leaving the rest of the audience wincing at this enormously hideous movie.  Vince Vaughn's so-called understated performance is almost comatose, can you say ""Dead man Acting""?  I suppose it's not entirely his fault, the script is bad, so horrifyingly bad, that it's hard to blame each and every actor in this movie for giving what will no doubt(hopefully, for their sake) be their worst performance ever turned in on the silver screen.

I watched this movie with 7 other people who, like me, enjoy a good comedy, and the unanimous conclusion was that Dodgeball was awful, a complete dud.  The biggest puzzle about Dodgeball is the commercial success it seems to be having both at the box office and on the rental shelves. Go ahead, while desperately seeking a few laughs, you may very well shell out your hard earned cash for this pathetic comedy, but mark my words, the joke will be on you.",1103241600,3,1336,4.620253164556962

He has his crew go after Vince Vaughn, as Peter Lefleur, and the Average Joe's customers. All a little odd themselves with a pirate in the group.

Where else could you go to see nerds and other oddballs totally obliterated with large rubber balls? Fans of movies like ""Zoolander"", ""The Waterboy"", and ""Shallow Hal"" should love it.

When a magazine ad indicates a dodgeball competition pays fifty thousand to the winners, they figure they have a good chance.

1514431,2,B00005JMYF,"Revenge of the nerds?

I'm shocked that so many found this movie to be funny. I'm sorry i wasted my money on it. I understand the role reversal idea where the tall hunky like vince vaughn ends up being the under dog everyman type guy and 5 foot nothing ben stiller is the greasy bad guy. Problem is it doesn't work. Stiller comes across as a comic book character and vaughn's understated humor is nearly comatose. The writing is horrible so of course the script is included with the dvd so you can read how horrible it is. It's bad!

Ben stiller plays this sleazy ceo of a multimillion dolar health club who i guess is really trying to overcome his own feelings of inferiority though the writing does little to flesh that out. He does have the blow up crotch in his spandex to make it look like he has more than he does ha ha. Vaughn's character owns a run down nearly bankrupt gym right across the street called ""average joe's"". Average joe's is no threat to the bigger gym so of course the stiller character is obsessed with taking it over. That would be tragic because all the nerds at average joe's have nothing else. Like we should care? The message here is that owners of successful businesses are egomaniacal facists, nazis? While owners of failed businesses are laid back cool guys? Note that the name of the ben stiller character ""white"" goodman. Make up your own mind what that is supposed to represent.

Anyway the mean facist ""white"" goodman is going after average joe's so now the vaughn character and his merry band of nerds needs to find a way to get $50,000 to keep average joe's and stop him. How do you raise 50K in america? Well win a nationwide dodge ball tourney of course. So they sign up and who will they play in the championship? A team led by the facist ""white"" goodman. What a shock. And you don't even need to guess who wins.

 In between all this you have numerous gags, about three dozen times someone will take a hit to the crotch and various cameo appearences by famous people. Some of the gags and lines are funny like when the stiller character asks the pretty christine taylor(his real life wife) if she would like to mate. She then gags and says ""i just vomited in my mouth"". Most are not funny.

All in all there are some funny moments but you never buy into the whole plot line. You could care less about any of the average joe's characters and vince vaughn's character is vegetated. He is usually smiling wryly and little else. Ben stiller's character is so bizzare, so weird you can't take him seriously enough to hate him.

Dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie, don't fall for it. The non-stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it's a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people.

In my humble opinion, if you have an IQ greater than 12, don't bother with Dodgeball.  Personally, I'd sooner watch a marathon of Paulie Shore and Carrot Top movies before sitting thru Dodgeball again, and that my friends, is saying something.",1103068800,7,701,4.666666666666667

""Dodgeball"" was entertaining, to say the least. Stiller plays an evil commercial-gym owner whose goal is to purchase the Average-Joe gym across the street. However, Vince Vaughn's character will have none of it, despite his $50,000 debt.

Enter solution: a dodgeball tournament with a grand prize of (drum roll please) $50,000.

""Dodgeball"" is the hilarious story of the average Joes' journey from ""average"" to ""dodgeball extrordinaires."" Packed with slapstick and potty humor, ""Dodgeball"" is sure to please 13-year-old boys (and my father) and Ben Stiller aficitionados alike.

I recommend this film to those that can take vulgar humor (e.g. hurling wrenches at people's heads: ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."") and to those that aren't looking for an incredibly thought-provoking film.

Overall: four stars.",1103068800,4,1086,5.1477272727272725

Movie Review

""Ready...and... DODGEBALL!"" Those were the words heard over and over during the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. This movie, is so great it should bring tears to your eyes... after laughing so hard.

Globogym owner and operator White Goodman (Ben Stiller) thinks he needs to expand his gym, so when the opportunity to take over Average Joe's Gym arises, he attacks. The owner of Average Joe's, Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn), won't go down without a fight. Average Joe's Gym must come up with $50,000, or they will have to shut down. What other way is there to win fifty grand, then playing Dodgeball? The loyal customers at Average Joe's decide to play in a dodgeball tournament with a grand prize of $50,000. White (Stiller) finds out, and enters his gym in the competition as well.

Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) is the old ex-dodgeballer who teaches the Average Joe's how to play Dodgeball by means of the 5 D's. Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge! Patches enjoys saying things like ""If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball,"" followed immediately by him throwing a wrench at someone, or saying ""if you can dodge traffic you can dodge a ball,"" followed immediately by Patches making the Average Joe's run through traffic.

Dodgeball is full of hilarious lines, such as the following: ""Peter La Fleur: Hang on a second. You wanna become a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser? Justin: Yeah. Why? Peter La Fleur: Nothing. High school's changed a bit since I was a kid.""

The witty commentators of the Dodgeball matches, Cotton McKnight (Gary Cole) and Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman) also have their fair share of hilarious comments. ""Cotton McKnight: I'm being told that Average Joe's does not have enough players and will be forfeiting the championship match.

Pepper Brooks: It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.""

""Cotton McKnight: In 23 years of broadcasting I thought I'd seen it all, folks. But it looks like Peter La Fleur has actually blindfolded himself.

Pepper Brooks: He will not be able to see very well, Cotton.""

Around the middle of the movie, six time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong appears, in an attempt to motivate Peter, and recommend that he doesn't quit.

Peter La Fleur: Uh, actually I decided to quit... Lance. Lance Armstrong: Quit? You know, once I was thinking of quitting when I was diagnosed with brain, lung and testicular cancer all at the same time. But with the love and support of my friends and family, I got back on the bike and won the Tour de France five times in a row. But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit. So what are you dying of that's keeping you from the finals? Peter La Fleur: Right now it feels a little bit like... shame. Lance Armstrong: Well, I guess if a person never quit when the going got tough, they wouldn't anything to regret for the rest of their life. Well good luck to you Peter. I'm sure this decision won't haunt you forever.

If you do end up watching this movie, which is a decision you will not regret, make sure you watch until the very end, after the credits are over...",1102982400,2,3127,4.624548736462094
1514506,5,B00005JMYF,This movie is among the top three funniest movies this year. The only other two that were as funny were Anchorman and Team America. I've never laughed so hard in a theatre in my life. The guy that plays the Underdogs coach was awesome. Ben Stillers ego-maniacal portrayal of the gym-owner was hilarious and Vince Vaugn's character was loveable. They were perfect nemeses (however you spell that). Without a doubt a must have for the holiday season.,1102982400,,448,4.8311688311688314
1514507,5,B00005JMYF,"This movie is impossible to watch with a straight face and without flinching. A true comedy in every sense of the word it will have you rolling in laughter and remembering your own experiences with the dreaded dodgeball.

In a world of infomercials and faultless people resides the perfect man, White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Goodman owns and controls a state of the art health club and spends his life combing his feathered hair, pumping up and electrocuting himself over donut and pizza cravings. With a personality as shallow as his appearance he is a true specimen of gag reflex in motion! Across the street is a run down gym for ""Average Joes"" run by a hapless man of little ambition, Pete La Fleur (Vince Vaughn). Goodman and La Fleur soon begin a power struggle over ownership of his little gym and the games begin. SMACK! SPLAT! In order to come up with $50K to save the average joes from being eaten alive by White's arrogant conglomeration La Fleur and his gang of misfit members join a dodgeball tournament. With all seriousness the nerds begin to work out with a legend in the sport and after getting hit by iron wrenches and plenty of balls they end up in Las Vegas for the championship. Needless to say Mr. White and his robotic over-steroided team are also willing to be turned into pulp by a bunch of flying balls...Ouch!!

Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are incredible in their roles as very serious gym owners and it is absolutely impossible not to laugh while watching this film. Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) does an excellent job as the girl both over jockulated men eventually vie for. Rip Torn is hilarious as the urine drinking dodgeball legend who eventually coaches greatness from his wheelchair. The gags and stabs at seekers of perfection are downright on the money with plenty of pumped up pecs and abs to fill an egotists dream. The average joes are all absolutely side-splitting with their uncoordinated efforts and messed up lives. The tournament is filled with subtle innuendos directed at everything funny about Japanese, German, Eastern European and Red Neck American athletes as well as that ever present superior being the Bodybuilder! Cameo appearances by Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff offer a few short moments of additional laughs. But the real hero of this film is the dodgeball itself, that red ball that has instilled so much fear in anyone who has ever faced it while hugging onto a wall cringing. I still can't figure out why watching people get hurt in innocent ways is so funny but I dare you to dodge the giggles that come from watching this movie each and every time someone gets smashed by a flying dodgeball!

1514509,2,B00005JMYF,"I have friends and family who were telling me how hilarious this movie was, and I only watched it because my roommate rented it. Here's to say, it's a comedy that doesn't generate very many laughs. It uses a lot of low-brow humor that is recycled and unoriginal. Also, what I was hoping to see the most of, the dodgeball game itself, just takes up a small portion of the very-short movie.
This movie reminded me a little of ""Kingpin"" and ""Baseketball,"" only those two were much funnier. I like Vince Vaughn, but there is reason why he's usually the 'bad guy' in movies. Vaughn is just coasting through this role, and is just bland and boring enough to make us not give a damn if he loses his gym or not. I'm tired of Ben Stiller playing basically the same character in a majority of his movies. Here he is talking in that stupid deep voice and spitting out stupid insults and comebacks again. How do people still find this funny? His career is dying slowly, maybe he can resurrect it a little in ""Meet The Fockers.""
There are a number of sight gags that fall completely flat throughout the movie. The dialougue was pretty lame, and people getting hit in the head and crouch gets old too fast! It was nice to see Christine Taylor kiss another chick at the end, of course, but where she proclaims that, ""I'm not a lesbian, I'm a bisexual,"" what the hell was that? That little part was just awkward. The only good things about this movie were the cameos by the likes of Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria, David Hasselhoff, and of course Chuck Norris, and every minute Rip Torn was on screen. Torn just plays with such a gritty, unconventional attitude! I thought ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"" was somewhat funny.
The movie didn't even make sense at times. It paints itself out of the corner so many times at the end there, it was ridiculous! First, Average Joe's team was going to have to forfeit, but wait!...there's a rule to overturn it. Vaughn's character gets knocked out by Stiller's, but wait!...he stepped over the line. Vaughn's team wins, but Stiller still gets Vaughn's gym, no wait!...Vaughn just happened to bet all his money on his team even though he was drinking beforehand and not planning on playing the final. Uhhhhhhhh! I wouldn't despise this movie so much if so many different ppl didn't tell me how great and funny it was. If you haven't seen this yet, don't go to any extent to see it right away! Maybe it's worth renting, but really only worth watching it if you can borrow it off a friend or neighbor, or roommate like I did.",1102896000,4,2531,4.492407809110629

1) Numerous shots to the bathing suit parts (Immature? Yes.  Always funny? Yes.)

2) A bar is named after something disgusting/funny/disgusting again.

3) Vince Vaughn occasionally reminds you that his dry wit still exists.

4) The blooper scene with the ref--""Laughing really ....""

5) The ""alternate"" ending.

All told, this list comprises roughly three and one half minutes of the movie.  After the tag-team debacle that is Starsky-->Dodgeball, it will be difficult for me to go see another heavily pimped Stiller production.

Anywho, sport movies seem to work better as comedies.  ""Caddyshack"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" made golf actually look interesting and fun.  ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Mr. 3000"" made baseball fun.  Even ""Field of Dreams"" made the sport seem spiritual as a movie.  This particular film is funny.  Great comic performances from all the cast.  The film breezes through nicely.  There's even a couple of romances.  Some good plot twists and fun, fun, fun.  Now imagine if t he boys from South Park would have helmed this project...",1102636800,2,668,4.823008849557522

1514551,4,B00005JMYF,"In its defense, you have to admit that ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" embraces every clich in the history of sports with a sense of joy.  More importantly, first time writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber manages to do this without being heavy handed, which is no mean feat.  He accomplishes this because since this 2004 comedy is trying to work in every clich in the history of sports underdogs (and sports underdogs movies) it has to really move along to get them all into the film.  There is no gratuitous milking of the movement in ""Dodgeball,"" because like the sport itself, the movie sends another ball whizzing at you and it is heading for one of three places: your head, your stomach, or right for the obvious metaphor.

The underdogs are the guys at Average Joe's Gym, where owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) takes a low-key approach to the health and physical fitness of his loyal and eccentric members.  This is in stark contrast to the high intensity environment across the street at Globo Gym, where White Goodman (Ben Stiller) has made narcissism an art form.  La Fleur is informed by attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) that he has 30 days to come up with $50,000 or lose his gym to (wait for it) Goodman.  It looks like all is lost until the gang at Average Joe's Gym discover that the American Dodgeball Association of America is having its national tournament and the winning teams gets (wait for it) $50,000.

What makes this film work is that both the clichs and the absurdities (the national champs of dodgeball only get $50,000?) are taken in stride by the characters, which makes it easier for the audience to go along with it as well.  Since the tournament is being covered by ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"") that certainly makes it legitimate, and there are all those screaming fans and teams from around the world.  While watching this movie there was both a point where my wife and I questioned the ""reality"" of the situation.  For her it was when the young Patches O'Houlihan (Hank Azaria) explained the rules of the game and said there were only six players on a team.  She took exception to that, based on personal experience no doubt, and I had to point out that he was talking about ""professional"" dodgeball.  Then when they started playing games in the movie I took exception to the idea that a match consists of a single game, which allowed her to point out that making it two out of three or whatever would just make the movie longer.  But once you start throwing red rubber balls at people it is hard to stop.

The key element in ""Dodgeball,"" strangely enough, is that of restraint.  Vaughn's La Fleur is a remarkable calm and understated hero (an approach that carries over into the extras on the DVD) and even Stiller's intense portrayal of the villain is rather restrained.  When these two stand toe to toe and exchange confusing insults it is even more fun then watching people get hit by dodgeballs and be sent flying.  In that regard it is Justin Long as Justin who is the master of being hit and hit repeatedly to great comic effect, although when he is hit by wrenches thrown by the adult Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), you really have to wince, over and over again.  That is why the best approach to the film is to be like the ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"") commentary tag-team of Cotton McKnight (Gary Cole) and Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman) and take every at face value and buy into it all the way, even if everybody knows the best strategy is to have a bunch of players all throw their balls at the same target at the same time.

It is not surprising that as a result of this film dodgeball leagues have sprung up all around the country.  After all, as we have learned from sports films in the past, if you show it, they will play...",1102464000,13,3770,4.547337278106509

It would be great if somebody would introduce the game to the mainstream and gave dogball it's own cable T.V. series. (The sport, not the movie) We could introduce games like CELEBRITY DOGEBALL!

Essentially, a group of slacking underdogs is going up against the big corporate machine...and the battlefield is a dodgeball court.  But the quality casting (Stephen Root proves he can handle any script thrown at him and has an extremely memorable role in this film) and smart directing (The film NEVER takes itself too seriously or tries too hard for the laughs) make this a worthwhile flick.

1514594,5,B00005JMYF,"Saw this movie while bouncing along the jet stream on an Airbus from Paris to Hong Kong. The thoughtful designers of the latest Airbus give even us peons in coach our own screen. Therefore I saw this as a long-term Fearful Flyer (with the additional *frisson* that we flew over the very scary border between Iraq and Iran). It is to this film's credit that it took my mind over my completely hypothetical sorrows.

On a deep level, this movie is a powerful social critique of an America in which (1) no-one ever really ""grew up"" and (2) the most retrograde and barbaric high-school pecking orders remain as a result.

Ben Stiller plays what the Yuppie has become, a complete a-hole of the sort that has littered Mt Everest with detritus as members of this caste ""achieve"" the Dream by trashing the roof of the world.

He is confronted by the left behind, a lost America of love in which people ate a plate of ham and eggs and looked out the window.

One knows that a neo-Capraesque resolution is more or less fore-ordained and one watches with pleasure as it is jokingly arrived at.

The film makes a joke of the Hitler Jugend culture which pervades America while not speaking its name, a culture of systematic sexual and racial humiliation which uses organized sports mostly to make people feel terrible about themselves.

The next step would be a remake of the Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner but the ""serious sports"" genre died out in the 1970s to be replaced by movies in which the ""loser"" doesn't get so much as to set himself apart (as does the runner) but is essentially co-opted, like Rocky, into the immortal System.

To its credit, this movie makes the System a joke. But the next step would do far more violence to sensibilities than this.",1101686400,5,1757,4.594249201277956

Forget the fact that they've seen it 20 times in previews on TV.  Wow, maybe I took the movie too seriously.  I guess it's all just a matter of opinion.  Speaking of which, see Napoleon Dynamite!

1514596,4,B00005JMYF,"Okay, so it's not the most intelligent comedy but it is a comedy and a good one at that.  Not every movie is supposed to make you think and laugh at the same time.  Some movies are just supposed to be funny (especially if starring Ben Stiller).  Dodgeball fulfilled this request and I'm so glad to see Vince Vaughn doing something.  He's such a great comedian with his dry subtle wit and really plays off of Stiller's over-the-top-ness well.  Was JErry Stiller in this movie?  I don't remember but let's just assume that he was.  Anyway, it was a great predictable movie and I thought the cameo with Lance Armstrong was the best scene (""What are you dying of?""  ""Right now.  Shame mostly"")

This movie goes great with ""Starksy and Hutch"" in which the roles are switched and Vaughn plays the baddie and Stiller is back to his ""Royal Tennebaums"" neurotic control freak character.

And yes, Ben Stiller has played this character he plays in ""Dodgeball"" before in a movie called ""Heavyweights"".  I would also recommend watching that.",1101340800,6,1029,4.719101123595506

The writing is the worst part.  The actors make much of a lot of really unfunny lines -- the dialogue is so off-the-mark that it rarely brings even a smile to the lips.  Add to this a male lead who is about as bland and uninteresting as you can imagine -- playing a sort of everyman that you can't even begin to root for -- and Dodgeball becomes a rather bland mess that doesn't live up to the potential of some of its funnier stars (Stephen Root and Ben Stiller at the top of the list).

It rests on the interplay between characters and the sheer exuberant fun of watching this group of misfits -- because even the ""cool"" guys are misfits (Ben Stiller and crew) -- exist in the only way they know how.

Some critics have called the movie low-brow because it does depend on physical comedy a great deal.  However, there is still a very smart edge to the dialogue.  Christine Taylor is sharply witty, especially in her dealings with Ben Stiller.  Vince Vaughn embodies the underacheiving slacker
