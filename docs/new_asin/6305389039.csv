1037006,5,6305389039,"We really enjoyed this movie.  Remember, It is just a movie.
Two thumbs up!!
Locations don't need to be real to make a point.
Scenery is very pretty. Poachers get what they deserve, brought to justice. The way that they made the animals suffer about makes you cry.

August{Indian} teaches about respect & appreciation for the wildlife, nature & in real life situations about family.
Teaches the kids a lot in 3 days.

Had a very good happy ending.

Very good movie we have seen in a very long time. Good family adventure type movie.  Due to the nature of the poachers, not suitable for a young audience.  More like pre-teen to Adult.  Not at all a small kids movie.

August{played in Free Willy Movies} playes the Indian in this movie.
Very good natured and teaches us a lot throughout the movie.
This movie is similar.

We liked the movie & are sharing our reviews with you.
It is added to our collection.",1222646400,9,906,4.50920245398773
1037007,5,6305389039,My kids really enjoyed this movie as they were growing up. Their ages ranged from 7 to 14 years. It was a good family movie.,1142294400,5,124,4.0
1037008,1,6305389039,"No, the putrid smell of rotting fish is more tolerable than viewing a movie that is so horrid it can't even be shoved into the ""cult classic"" category!!!

Plot? Well, an AmerIndian interacts with two teens, several poachers, a bear, parents, game wardens and sundry critters that lend ambience to a warm fuzzy all critters are brothers except for the bad guys who have the rifle aiming ability of, well, a bear shooting a rifle.

Inane, senseless, non-plausible yet far-removed from fantasy. I am shocked and awed, perhaps even astounded, that a real human would place their name as being responsible for the creation of this coma-inducing time waster.

Flee...... run away.... do not come near any electronic device conveying this so-called movie.

The only use I can imagine for this attrocity is to give it as a gift to someone you despise, that you hate with liver quivering unadulterated passion.

The only practical use I can think of for this incredibly horrific movie is to use it to garner confessions from criminal suspects. Even then, once a jury learned a confession was gained from the suspect being forced to view this movie repetitively, it is likely the confession would be tossed aside and the detectives using this movie would be charged with some sort of cruelty to a prisoner if not a crime against humanity.

I must admit, though, my scathing commentary has been watered down. The movie is even worse that what I declare it to be.",1142035200,8,1451,4.807228915662651
1037009,1,6305389039,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  The character development is poor and stereotypical.  The plot is too simplistic and unbelievable even for children.

I have lived in the area where the area was filmed.  There are no wolves, kodiak bears (a few black bears), moose or elk in the Tantalus range.  The producer could have put a more effort into research.",1105920000,6,359,4.725806451612903

7890266,1,6305389039,Not a good film the music which was Indian chanting could possibly cause one to shoot yourself!! The writing and acting were on a scale with most B rated movies. How this got a four star rating is beyond me. I want a refund cant believe I paid to see this.,1524873600,,256,4.03921568627451

7890270,1,6305389039,I did not like the brutality of this movie. A bear was killed in this movie by one of those bear traps and a bullet. I don't see how it reaped so many five star reviews. I had to fast forward through many scenes. About the only good thing with this movie was the wilderness photography. I would never recommend the purchase of the movie even for one dollar.,1518220800,,357,4.188405797101449
