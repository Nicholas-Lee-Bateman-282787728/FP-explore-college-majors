1930536,5,B0000E2PVR,"We just signed up for HBO this year, and immediately became addicted to this hilarious show.  Now we want to see all of the episodes we have missed -- come on HBO, I Want My Curb Your Enthusiasm!",1039392000,2,195,4.131578947368421
1930537,5,B0000E2PVR,"I am crushed that they do not even have the first seasons on DVD.  I just got HBO this year for the Sopranos, a very good show, but it isn't what I looked forward to the most!  CYE is absolutely genious.  It would be a crime if HBO didn't release a DVD compilation set of the 3 seasons.  I've only seen about 4 episodes and I'm totally hooked.  Hopefully HBO will get on it soon.  If you are reading this on the sight, make sure you put your email in at the top to let HBO know that you want it!",1038700800,2,495,3.8514851485148514
1930538,5,B0000E2PVR,"Larry David. Just looking at a picture of him can make me laugh. This show is not for everybody. But for those who watched Seinfeld, David is sort of a combination of George and Jerry. He seems to mean well and have a good heart but always lose in the end. Larry is the best. It was great seeing the show get a nomination for Best Comedy Series. Sunday nights just aren't quite Sunday nights without my ""Curb"" fix. Please bring out the DVD set soon HBO. Why haven't you put it out yet? I thought we were cool-de-la???",1038528000,3,517,4.232323232323233
1930539,5,B0000E2PVR,"This is the funniest show i have ever seen, but i don't get to see all the episodes, because i just miss them because of buisiness conflicts. Release this series on DVD!",1038096000,,169,4.3125
1930540,5,B0000E2PVR,"Theyve only showed a couple of episodes at 11:30pm, here in Australia, and axed the show, right when I got addicted to it. It grew on me slowly, the first time i watched i was trying to make sense of it all, then i realised you're not supposed to! Larry David is a comic genius! I cant wait till they bring out the dvd (hopefully all 3 seasons). I have no other way of watching this masterful comedy. I may move to the states just to watch it!",1037232000,2,443,4.045454545454546
1930541,5,B0000E2PVR,My husband and I just started watching this season.  LARRY IS A  RIOT!!!  We love it!!!  We can't get enough of this show.  We even watch the previous season's episodes on HBO commedy.  They are on weeknights. We never miss an episode.  We can't wait until the first and second season comes out on DVD!!!,1036540800,,304,4.418181818181818
1930542,5,B0000E2PVR,"All I can say is, believe the hype! Larry David along with sexy co-star Cheryl Hines make up some of the best 'husband and wife' comedic chemistry ever!
HBO cannot put out the 'CYE' DVD series fast enough!",1036281600,,205,4.421052631578948
1930543,5,B0000E2PVR,LARRY KICKS...! I live each week just waiting for this to come on! It has to be the funniest show on television and I hope now that its on after the Sorpranos more people get hooked like me and realize what they have been missing! Hysterical!,1032134400,,242,4.282608695652174
1930544,5,B0000E2PVR,"If you can stand Seinfeld with no language restrictions, this show is insanely great.  Larry David is a genius, and doesn't fear making himself look like a totally self-centered and horrid person.  The fact that his character is ""Larry David, the Creator of Seinfeld"" in the show wonderfully blurs the line between reality and fiction.
When you see this show, you will realize that the greatest part of the Seinfeld show was from the mind of Larry David.  This alone makes the show fascinating to watch.
There are wonderful recurring cameos by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Richard Lewis, and a host of others.
There is a significant level of discomfort watching this show, and you might even find yourself yelling at the TV as Larry David digs himself into ever deeper holes through his habit of obfuscation and dissassembly.  The hilarious thing is that his intentions are generally good, but the result is disastrous.  It's wonderful that he never really learns why people end up despising him so much.  If he did, he wouldn't get into so much trouble and the show wouldn't be nearly as funny.
The humor is very REAL, despite coming from rather outlandish circumstances at times.  If you have any appreciation of existential humor, you MUST see this show.  It is a true treasure of modern comedy.",1029974400,45,1307,4.882352941176471
1930545,1,B0000E2PVR,Painful to watch. I dislike this show so much I'd pay to stop watching it.,1513209600,,74,4.0
1930546,5,B0000E2PVR,Probably one of the best comedy shows since Faulty Towers!! Its very cleverly done and usually answers a lot of questions we all have but will not ask due to being PC and Larry David is not PC at all which is the best part!! So happy to welcome him back!,1512777600,,254,4.0

1930551,1,B0000E2PVR,I hate this show. It's just an old dude with bad social skills who thinks his faux pas are hilarious. They aren't.,1511481600,,114,4.2272727272727275
1930552,1,B0000E2PVR,Larry David is a putz and his humor is lame. Watch something else.,1510876800,,66,4.153846153846154

1930557,5,B0000E2PVR,"Curb Your Enthusiasm is written and Directed by Larry David.  Most of it is all ad-libbed.  Can't you see when they want to bust out laughing.  You may think it's slow, and not funny, but this is how he is in real life.  He is the Director of Seinfeld.  All the cast that is in this series are indeed his neighbors, friends, and guest appearances, wanted to do the scenes, That is what a platform this show was.  I hope he does another 9 series~  LD <3",1508803200,3,452,4.126436781609195

1930563,2,B0000E2PVR,"ruined by the ""Reality"" feel of it. yes, we know reality style shows are cheaper to make. just like we know you pay the 3rd world to write 5 star reviews. also it smelt like Woody Allen. on a positive note it was able to achieve the plot style of Seinfeld but it only had the humor level of superstore. the actors talked like real people not like actors delivering a punch line, this is a bad thing. the shakiness of the camera had a motion sickness feel to it. even if you like reality shows do you think planned dialogue happens like that? no so that's ruined too. this ran for so long because it cost 0 to make so the profits are huge.",1506729600,,638,4.112

1930566,3,B0000E2PVR,A good laugh for a few episodes but became too obvious or too uncomfortable for me to continue watching. The main character accidentally offends and then struggles to apologize while just digging his grave deeper by making more and more mistakes. By the end of an episode nothing is really resolved and the characters just get on with their lives.,1505433600,,347,4.8

1930575,2,B0000E2PVR,"Some viewers might be offended by the sexual innuendo, but I wasn't. That had nothing to do with being unaable to make it through the first episode, with its major thread about the cause of a bulge caused by extra fabric in his pants.

It was often mentioned during this episode of Mary Steenburgen's affiliation with the Clintons when she lived in Arkansas.
That did it for me!
As for Larry David, he's a huge supporter of the worst president in the history of the Unite States, none other than Barrack Obama.

1931008,1,B0000E2PVR,The narrative of the entire 8 seasons becomes obvious after the first few episodes. Each episode portrays Larry as an uptight narcissistic idiot who gets himself into frustrating (for the viewer) situations that would be easily avoided if his character was in any way a decent person. In fact every situation he gets himself into is so unbelievably stupid and self defeating that it completely broke my immersion in every episode. AVOID this trash.,1477094400,,448,5.0675675675675675

1931010,3,B0000E2PVR,Wearisome but clever enough to keep me coming back. I think it is the shadow of Sienfield gags that Larry likes to lean on. It's creativity is mostly a ripoff of the Sienfield genius we enjoyed so long. Worst part is Larry's pain in the neck wife. She has little to offer except the vintage whine.,1477094400,,297,4.321428571428571

I am a huge long time Seinfeld fan and I was curious to see how  this show measured up with the 90's classic.  I certainly was not disappointed.  I would describe this show as Seinfeld with a bit of an edge, or Seinfeld with an R-rating.  Larry David has the same mundane observations of everyday life as a typical character in Seinfeld.  I thought it was also neat to have an occasional appearance of some of the primary stars of Seinfeld as well as some familiar faces of secondary characters on the show.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is an excellent show to turn on after a long day at work.  Laughs will come easily and often.",1474848000,,697,4.348837209302325

1931566,5,B0000E2PVR,"First few episodes were really slow, but after that I was hooked.  I always wondered why Seinfeld was so funny in the sitcom but terrible doing stand-up, well it's because this is the genius behind his TV character, right down to the mannerisms.

With each passing episode I feel compelled to tune in for another to watch the painfully awkward and hilarious moments that ensue from Larry's bad decisions and lack of empathy for anyone other than himself.  This show could of almost been named instant karma as it seems everything he does always comes back to bite him by the time each episode has finished.

If you enjoyed Seinfeld even in the slightest, you owe it to yourself to check out this series, just give it a few episodes before you throw in the towel.",1466467200,,762,4.580882352941177

1932194,2,B0000E2PVR,"Larry David writes great material, but his delivery is not played off well.
If this show was done with any other actor saying the exact same lines the show would be a lot better.

The idea of micromanaging every thought that comes to us makes for great comedic results because we see ourselves in these characters.
Larry David should remove himself from his material and speak through another actor's mannerisms. Case in point, Jason Alexander is basically doing Larry David with a touch of Woody Allen(Jason A said this himself in an interview). Jason pulls off Larry David's words and makes them believable.

Larry David is a comedic genius and I love being able to see the humor being emitted over the HBO experience that could not broadcast on regular television back in the day. Larry is constantly getting himself into little predicaments that we might all find ourselves in at one point or another, but revved up and amplified to make you laugh until your abs look like a washboard. Larry's rants make you feel like you are there. Lastly, Cheryl Hines and Jeff Garlin are the perfect cast to accelerate the David Debauchery.",1461715200,2,697,4.453125

Ladies, if you really want to find out what guys REALLY think about things, watch this series. What's normal ""everyday"" items to women, like dinner parties, gift buying/wrapping, socializing, etc. are unpleasant situations for most guys. (Larry's sitcom wife handles it/him beautifully.)

1934000,5,B0000E2PVR,"I was already a fan of Seinfeld and knew that Larry had been one of the creators (with Jerry). I had seen him perform as Steinbrunner and Castro and a few other parts on Seinfeld and liked all of those performances. Many of those did not involve seeing his face. So this show was the first time I got to see Larry in performance. I loved the show right from the start. I know some people had to grow into it but perhaps watching all of Seinfeld helped me accept it faster.

The show is Larry, supposedly in close to his real life persona. I am inclined to believe this is more true than not as his other roles are not far removed. He is totally obnoxious and that is half the fun. Equally as fun is that his obnoxious conduct usually gets him into hot water sooner or later. Very hot water. The supporting cast is great too. Jeff Garlin as his agent is wonderful and the comic who plays his wife Susie almost steals the entire show she is so funny.

Then there is Larry with anyone who is black. He is already pretty funny with anyone who is also Jewish but put him with someone who is black and he is in the stratosphere of comedy.

Really a great show and I like it as much if not more than Seinfeld, which is saying a lot.",1452470400,,1225,4.117154811715481

I watched a few episodes and although there were a few moments that made me smile, on the whole I found it not very funny and a waste of time. Perhaps it's the reality TV feel that turns me off. Or maybe I just don't get it. But I think mostly it's the fact that great comedy is a an art form and CYE doesn't come close to measuring up.

Cringingly funny!",1447891200,,249,5.756756756756757
1934197,5,B0000E2PVR,"First off, I love Seinfeld and have seen every episode multiple times. I did not know a thing about curb your enthusiasm until 2005 when I bought season 4 from AAFES because it was a rental, cheap and the cover was funny. I don't usually like to start a series in the middle but I only had the one DVD set so I watched it and loved it. I bought every season I could with the intention of watching, but I had them in storage for a few days while I was moving and some A-hole broke into my unit and stole a lot of things, these DVD's being taken too.

Anyway, I just finished the whole series thanks to Amazon Prime. I binge watched it, and I usually don't do that. I started from Season 1 and just finished Season 8 yesterday, and I'm hoping LD comes out with a final season 9. Of course, I would ask for a season 10 after that, so it could go on forever. If you have Prime, give a few episodes a shot. It's not an acquired taste. I could watch any singular episode from any of the seasons and enjoy it.

The one thing I disliked was after season 6 they changed cameras or formats or something because it looks different. That's my only complaint. I liked it how it looked like it was an amateur TV show. 7&8 made it more professional looking. Not a bad thing, but if I have to nitpick something to dislike, it's that.

The whole series is packed with great performances. Other than LD, I absolutely love Richard Lewis in it, and wish he had a bigger role in the show. Other memorable roles are Bob Einstein as Marty Funkhouser, LD's ""best friend"", who I disliked at first but he really shined in the middle/later seasons. JB Smoove as Leon Black is really great as well. Of course Suzie and Jeff are awesome as LD's manager and wife. There's a lot of cameos too. I don't want to spoil it, just watch.

The worst part of the show is when the Blacks are basically pushed into the show. That's the only part of the show that seems real phony. It's still enjoyable, but the plot and everything else seem disheveled compared to previous seasons.

There's the mini Seinfeld reunion. Eh. Could have gone without it, but it's great seeing the gang back together.

Overall I love this series. Many many many Seinfeld show references if you know them pretty well.",1447891200,3,2253,4.289411764705882

The story on each episode is well written. The actor, Larry David, acting as himself, does it so naturally which helps giving the show its reality-show-like style.
I've always seen this show around on Amazon prime, given the fact that first aired back in 2001. But by it's name and picture of and old bald guy, it didn't appeal me much.

""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is what ""Seinfeld"" would have been had it originally aired on HBO... All the things they could never have gotten away with on NBC, but here on HBO they had free reign... and the results are hilarious... George Costanza may have been based on Larry David, but here we see the version of Larry David's ""George Costanza"" after having spent half a lifetime with Jerry Seinfeld...

Innocence meets ignorance and then gives birth to the most brilliant comedic scenes.  Sure, sometimes you cringe. But its not like ""Hello, Ladies"" kinda cringing where you violently grasp the nearest pillow to bury your face, while groaning in empathetic embarrassment for the lead character.

Jerry Seinfeld is a mediocre comedian who has been thrust into comedy royalty from the sitcom that bears his name.

Larry David embraces his dislike for humanity by using Curb Your Enthusiasm as a vice for saying what we are all thinking at times, while playing out the scenario of potential results we would all experience for doing so with a comedic twist that keeps you coming back for more.

1934552,4,B0000E2PVR,"This is a very funny show if you enjoy witty, albeit sarcastic, humor. Larry David plays a fictionalized, morallly questionable version of himself where he constantly  adresses the social norms of day to day life as a somewhat retired television writer in Los Angeles.

Cheryl Hines expertly plays the role of his wife who is often embarassed by Her husbands antics and rants and Jeff Garlin was casted as his always-funny manager.

The HBO show witnesses a plethora of cameos made by other famous hollywood celebrities living in or near Los Angeles as as well. The fact that the show aired on HBO makes it unsuitable for a young audience, anyone under 18, due to the writing's somewhat crude and raunchy nature.

The only part of the show that seems to grow old is the fact that many of the scenes contain people consistently talking over others, while exemplifying Larry's crazy antics, becomes somewhat annoying.

Overall, this is a very funny show that is definitely worth a watch if you are into somewhat dark and critical humor as is seemingly always carried out by Larry David.",1445472000,,1084,4.806451612903226

I like the writing and stories but I too have trouble with the profanity used in most episodes. I understand people actually use these words as part of the vocabulary but even still some episodes hurt to watch. Thank God for the fast forward button. Overall I enjoy watching this humor.

1934778,2,B0000E2PVR,"""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" reading the description of it, I thought it would be humorous and fun to watch.  However, what I discovered is a lot of sexual content and innuendo that I just don't care for and don't want to listen to.  I am a firm believer that innuendo is fine, but then this show crosses the line into just blatant sexual humor that, quite honestly, I don't think is that funny.  Maybe my age is showing but I just think that some things can be left to the imagination and don't need to be so overly-sexualized in content.  There is so much humor in life that doesn't revolve around sex, sexual parts, and sexual acts.  I wish comedians would step back and realize that sometimes less is more...and not all of us are so singlemindedly sex-crazed.

Like, I bring my own sheets and towels with me whenever I stay in a hotel. The more expensive the room, the more linens I bring. Cause I figure that someone who spends $500 a night for a room is gonna spend plenty of time there to get his money's worth, as opposed to someone who stays at a Motel Six.

Just annoying. They have to mention that he was the co-creator to Seinfeld like every other word--obviously his only claim to self-importance. And it shows. This show is Seinfeld Redux.

I have to let my politics go watching this show though because he does refer quite often to the fact that he is a liberal and hates Fox News because of their politics. Of course anything we watch is going to have Hollywood liberals as the actors. I just do not want them to use their status as actors as a platform to express their political views.

1936155,5,B0000E2PVR,"This is side-splitting stuff from the master. Forget about Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David is one pretty, pretty funny Jew, I tell you!!!!!!!  This guy could write a whole series about a loaf of bread and it would be funny. The only job I envy, is working for Larry David as a writer.

The other day I asked a guy I know at a food stand in a vegan fair, if I could have a half serve because I had eaten so much that day that I felt stuffed, but I really wanted to try his dish. He was more than happy to give it me, and in fact, he didn't even charge me. A little later, a friend of mine who was working at the fair, asked if I would get her some cake from another stall, but they didn't have spoons, so I went back to the guy who gave me the small serve and asked if I could have one of his disposable spoons and he gave me a funny look and kind of begrudgingly said yes. I thought it was a bit strange until minute later, I realized that he was probably wondering, ""why would he want a spoon for some food if he is already full and only wanted a small serve of my food"". So the next day, I had to go back and order a full serve, just to make sure he was happy with me, because it was too hard to explain something that was probably not real anyway, maybe I misread his disgruntled look.

This is the type of every day confusion that Larry David writes about, but he gives it a test and then segues into the B, A or even C story so seamlessly, that you don't see it coming.  It is hilarious.",1440806400,,1488,3.900990099009901
1936156,5,B0000E2PVR,"Love this show and love Larry David.  Show is sometimes absurd and funny and sometimes hits on real everyday situations we all encounter and are annoyed by, where Mr. David can find humor.  Wish we had more talent like this.  I have taken to watching most shows produced in either Australia, Great Britan, Canada or anywhere other than the US.  Our series (with a few exceptions here and there) are trite, and poorly acted.  Seems the US is more concerned with  putting beautiful people bulging out of their clothes on the screen as opposed to fine actors. And fine screen writers and directors must be very hard to come by.",1440806400,,624,4.627272727272727

He was my first celebrity crush in Robin Hood: Men in Tights when I was a little kid. I fall for the funny ones, I know, I can't help myself.

1936611,5,B0000E2PVR,"Funniest show since ""All in the family"" and Seinfeld"" . Larry David is a genius. When you watch Seinfeld  the words coming out
of the actors mouth on the show are written by Larry David and Jerry. After some research Larry David is the main writer on the show with
jerry for back up. When jerry was offered 5 million a episode, Larry David was offered the same and 3% of the sales of DVDS and merchandise. Its a bit more complex with the financials but I would need 3 pages to explain properly............Bottom line, best Comedy on HBO to this day and T.V.",1440547200,,557,4.355769230769231
1936612,5,B0000E2PVR,"Larry David is the most obnoxious and rude person you could ever meet.  It seems when something bad should happen he is the cause of it.  The episodes are hilarious though and I just love them.  Cheryl changed her hair color and she also seems different.  His manager seems to have gotten fatter and his parents (the manager's)  (especially the mother) are a pain in the neck.  Larry has to apologize to them because they are Jewish and he used the wrong word on the phone (speaker phone!!)  He also has to buy the mother a gift for her birthday (REALLY!!) which she really doesn't like.

1936645,5,B0000E2PVR,"Neurotic, witty, sometimes dark, but always funny, Larry David plays himself in this pseudo autobiographical sitcom loaded with popculture references and irreverant commentary on modern life for a somewhat not so modern man. The humor presented mostly comes from the outrageous situations LD and his friends/family find themselves in, usually involving a social faux pas or two. There are many celebrity cameos as well, and I particularly enjoyed seeing Jason Alexander getting some work. There are layers and layers of inside jokes and subtle jabs at everyone and everything, from Kathy Griffin to charity work. I highly recommend this series for anyone who is a fan of laughing/chuckling/guffawing or giggling. Snickerers may or may not enjoy.",1440460800,,745,5.431034482758621

Following the end of Seinfeld, David was inactive for a brief period of time. That is until 2000, when Larry was back with his new show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which stars Larry as himself. Something about this show just works, their isn't a definite script of dialog, it is an outline with a lot of improvising. This show is honestly one of those shows that you have to catch on a weekly basis. For some reason the Larry David character has become just one of those characters that you have to tune in for each week to see what trouble he is getting himself into.",1440374400,3,673,4.524590163934426

1937278,2,B0000E2PVR,"Based on the numerous other 5 star reviews, I realize I'm in the minority of not liking this show.  It's my personal opinion, but I think Larry David is annoying as an actor.  His voice is extremely irritating to me, mostly because he voiced the George Steinbrenner character on Seinfeld and that's all I hear when he talks.  That's my problem, but Larry David uses so much of the same dialogue from the Steinbrenner character from Seinfeld that's it's lazy and irritating to the viewer.  So much of this show was already done on Seinfeld, Larry David just reuses the Seinfeld dialogue and storylines, plus he seems to be imitating Jerry Seinfeld when he acts.

This show wants viewers to believe this is Larry David's real life with a little TV magic to blur the line between fiction and real life.  Viewers are expected to believe Larry David is a normal guy that does normal everyday things and just happens to have funny and awkward things happen to him.  The scenarios are so obviously invented and written, it's typical TV because they have to fill 30 minutes.  The episodes are predictable, situations are artificially complicated to fill 30 minutes.  The issues that happen in the episodes aren't believable, Larry David has over $100 million dollars and wouldn't be in these situations.",1439942400,,1295,4.823529411764706

I didn't continue to watch because I found the show flat, less than funny because of all the negativity surrounding the main character. It seemed like everything he did had a negative consequence. I certainly did see some humor in the situations he found himself in, but it was always a dry humor. It seemed the basis of the show was going to be his never-ending plight in everything he did. With regard to watching more episodes, I will try to give it a shot simply because so many other reviewers say it's great, and that it grows on you. I'll update here after I've watched a few more shows.",1439856000,,693,4.297709923664122

Turns out they're just like the rest of us except they have money to smooth over their stupid behavior. Curb Your Enthusiasm is not a series I can binge on. After a while, I get tired of Larry being obtuse, literal, and annoying. I watch a few episodes and then take a break. I've seen almost all of Curb.

1937871,4,B0000E2PVR,"The ability to take simple things of life and turn them into a story that is not only very humorous and whimsical is perhaps the most difficult of sitcom writing. The wit here is an undercurrent that stretches the imagination in unusual ways and the just when you believe there is no more to be heard, an additional piece comes on board. Quite ingenious, creative and provocative.",1439251200,,380,4.686567164179104
1937872,5,B0000E2PVR,"May be one of the best shows ever written.  It's Seinfeld (another top 10 show of ALL TIME) on a whole new level of comedy.  It shows the true genius of Larry David and how funny a sitcom can be without network or studio input.  This show is well acted and written (well great story lines).  Larry doesn't write most of the show, he outlines and ""improv's"" most of it.  He does a story outline and the actors improvisational a good portion of the scene.  Isn't Larry a GENIUS!!!  Get ready to laugh and have the best time of your life.  I watch this show when I can and it still makes me laugh.  I have seen some episodes up to 20 times.  My favorite is the water bottle with the little girl in the bathroom (THE DOLL) episode and the Dodger Game with the ""lady of the evening"" so he can use the carpool lane (THE CAR POOL LANE).  His episode titles are so easy to remember.  Hey that episode kept a man out of prison for REAL (google it).  I can't say enough on how good this show is to watch.  Do yourself a favor and watch it if you never have seen an episode.  Each year get's better and better.  How many times can you say that about a TV show.  Well, Seinfeld of course.  HBO and I hope both hope that Larry does another season soon.  He has an open contract with HBO, so he can if he wants.  PLEASE LARRY, more ""Curb"" soon!!!  You are my ######.  I can't say it but all you Curb fans know what I mean.  Great cameo's too.  From Alanis Morissette to the cast of Seinfeld.  I love this show",1439251200,,1495,4.072413793103448

Cheryl Hines, his patient wife, Jeff Garland, his brown-nosing agent, and foul-mouthed Suzy Essman. My favorite episode for this season is Porno Gil. Recommend!",1439251200,,304,5.1

8001655,1,B0000E2PVR,"It becomes very clear very quickly who the main writer was for the SEINFELD SHOW and it was not Larry David.
Curb your Enthusiasm is just OK, barely. SMH.  I was hoping for the same level of comedy as Seinfeld and found only a minis cue amount of laughs. In addition
the production quality of the show reminds me of a High School level. Lousy video resolution, poor audio overall LOW BUDGET. How on earth this show is receiving 5 and 4 star reviews can only be explained by the fact that, comedy today has a bar that has been lowered to zero. I'm piling on now but also you have to ENDURE LARRY'S RADICAL LEFTWING AGENDA, which might be tolerable if the show was FUNNY, BUT IT'S NOT.",1519171200,,683,4.294573643410852

Brilliantly written dialog! This series shows just how stupid it is too overthink anything period, and how many genuinely idiotic misunderstandings there are in everyone's life!

I wish I would have watched this many years ago, because I've over thought everything my entire life!

If you don't like this show, than you simply don't like dry, irreverent, unapologetic humor.

If you like this show watch 'Clear History' with Larry David and Jon Hamm its just as dry, inappropriate and hilarious!",1516838400,,542,4.988888888888889
