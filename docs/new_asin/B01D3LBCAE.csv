7696402,5,B01D3LBCAE,"""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" Starring Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, James Earl Jones and Slim Pickens.  Directed by Stanley Kubrick. 93 minutes. Rated ""approved.""

At the risk of dating myself I remember the Cuban missile crisis, backyard bomb shelters and drills where we kids would be hustled into an interior room at the school to ride out the onslaught of inbound ICBMs.

It was not funny.

But that was life in the early 60s and oddly my recollection of those events seems framed in a black-and-white panorama of worry and fear, much like ""Dr. Strangelove,"" which deploys its dark humor to accentuate the absurdity of mutually assured destruction.

For those of you who missed this cinematic classic, here's the plot: An Air Force general becomes convinced the communists are subverting America through fluoridated water. He dispatches a wing of nuclear-armed B-52s to destroy the Soviet Union. The Strategic Air Command is made aware of the situation and huddles with the president in the ""War Room"" to devise a strategy for recalling the bombers. The Russian ambassador is brought in and reveals the existence of a ""doomsday device,"" a network of cobalt-jacketed hydrogen bombs that will spread lethal radiation across the world if Russia is nuked. The bombers are recalled, but one, damaged by an anti-aircraft missile, continues on its mission. ...

""Strangelove"" provides a canvas for stunning performances by George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and most notably Peter Sellers of ""Pink Panther"" fame, who plays three roles, that of R.A.F. Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove himself, a wheelchair-bound Nazi scientist who wages a minute-by-minute battle with his black-gloved hand for control of his loyalties - to his new American friends or his old friends at the Reichstag.

But ""Strangelove's"" best performance comes from the screenplay, written by director Stanley Kubrick, which skewers all the institutions Americans relied on to guide them through the Cold War: the military, the government, and what most people would call common sense. As the B-52s streak toward the Soviet Union, Scott's Gen. Buck Turgidson argues for an all-out attack - and why not? ""We could catch them with their pants down!"" Turgidson enthuses.

""Strangelove"" is so steeped in historical context that nobody under the age 45 is likely to grasp its sophistication and nuance - a skill of perception sadly lacking in contemporary audiences. Yet ""Strangelove"" is one of the 20th century's greatest films, serving up a damning indictment of bureaucracy, the military-industrial complex and a simple-minded us-or-them worldview that cannot exist in today's interconnected global village.

""Gentlemen!"" President Muffley shouts as Turgidson and Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky grapple over a secret camera. ""You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!""

As John McCain might say, ""That, my friends, is Dr. Strangelove.' ''

7696403,5,B01D3LBCAE,"A great movie and a reminder of how close civilization nearly ended. This is a throwback to the 1960s, when the world might have gone under in a nuclear war. It is good to have a reminder of that near-miss. The experience should be a corrective to some people who seem to think that screaming and threatening are good foreign policies.

7696404,5,B01D3LBCAE,"There is good reason to regard Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) as Stanley Kubricks most perfectly realized film. Made at the crossroads of his career, it is the work which carries through to its fullest extent his perception (germinating through The Killing, Paths of Glory and Lolita) of mechanical man trapping himself within machines of his own making. It is also the film that announces the metaphysical tenor that will be expressed in texts (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon) which will be increasingly open and speculative. In many ways Dr. Strangelove is a classic Kubrick text, but in one sense it is crucially atypical. An achingly funny, tightly structured Swiftian satire, it is the only Kubrick film that communicates so compellingly and so insistently through the spoken word as opposed to his usual insistence on ideas expressing themselves through conceptual cinematography. It relies on a brilliant script (Terry Southern giving terrific satiric bite to Kubrick and Peter Georges adaptation of the latters originally very serious novel Red Alert), and a cluster of absolutely marvelous performances which involved a lot of improvisation and necessitated a great deal of temporal re-jigging at the editing stage by Kubrick and his editor Anthony Harvey. The anarchic nature of Dr. Strangeloves satire necessitated a kind of on the spur of the moment inspiration as every day of shooting involved constant re-writing with great emphasis laid on collaboration between all the artists concerned. In a usual Kubrick film its fair comment to say actors simply do as they are told and the success of their performances comes down to casting, script and direction, but here in addition to the script and Kubricks overall worldview, any analysis has to take into account the amazing acting which is crucial for getting the wicked humor across. What follows contains spoilers. Dont read if you haven't seen.

As everyone surely knows Dr. Strangelove is the film which made people laugh at thermonuclear global destruction. In 1963 this was outrageous as well as timely for Kubrick here cashes in on the post-World War 2 nuclear paranoia which had just recently flared up in Cuba. Stanley Kramers On the Beach and Sidney Lumets Fail Safe were earnest, respectable films made on the same subject which treated it with appropriate gravity. But Kubrick and producer James B. Harris realized nuclear threat could be even scarier if treated irreverently and in Swiftian dead-pan satiric fashion. Like Jonathan Swifts A Modest Proposal (1729) their film would be a Juvenalian satire with a clear point of attack. Swift suggested the poor Irish peasants might ease their suffering by selling their children as food to rich English absentee landlords and ladies. His target of attack was the rationalistic thinking of the English establishment at the expense of traditional human values. Likewise Kubrick attacks the rationalist thinking of the American military establishment who also disregard human values. He suggests the nuclear defense system is so full-proof, so cast-iron safe and so reliable that it only wants one man in a senior position to make a mistake and the whole system will be compromised, and further to that, the various safeguards and failsafe mechanisms are so efficient that they ensure an unstoppable chain reaction which ends in inevitable nuclear annihilation.

The American military establishment is one of Kubricks machines in which mechanical man entraps himself and the director breaks it down into three locations  the War Room in the Pentagon containing President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his chiefs of staff, the office and the grounds of Burpelson Air Force Base containing base commander Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who presides over the SAC 843rd Bomb Wing which is air-born constantly, and the inside of a B-52 bomber piloted by Major T. J. King Kong (Slim Pickens) and stationed 2 hours away from their target in Russia. All characters are mere cogs in the human machine. As per the satiric remit we learn nothing personal about anyone, everyone being extensions of their immediate machines which all interlock at a higher level. Ripper is the cog who fails and causes everyone else to fail in a series of events spun on mechanical inevitability. He goes a little funny in the head and orders his planes to attack Russia under the provisions of Wing Attack Plan R, the plan authorizing an officer to order an attack if the chain of command from the President has been disrupted. The crew of the B-52 assume America has already been hit by Russian nuclear missiles, seal off all communication to the plane, and concentrate on reaching their target. Ripper orders his airbase be sealed off and protected from any intruding force. Kubrick spends the whole narrative cutting between these 3 locations, each of which is isolated. Not only can each location not communicate with the other, but the characters within each location also cannot communicate with each other. As so often in Kubrick people talk without saying anything. There is no normal dialogue in the film as the English language is laundered of meaning and given 3 brands of inarticulacy. At Burpelson we have lunatic ravings as Ripper rambles incoherently to his executive officer Mandrake (Peter Sellers again) about the Commie conspiracy, purity of essence and bodily fluids. On the B-52 we have an endless stream of military jargon as the crew do what they have to do to dodge a missile and continue to their target. They are very obviously mechanical extensions of the very machine they are flying. And in the War Room we have endless clichs as Muffley listens to his jingoistic USAF Chief of Staff General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) and deals with the Russians, the ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) and, on the hotline, Premier Kissoff. Things get even more mechanized when the Russians reveal they have a doomsday machine which will trigger several nuclear bombs which will shroud the world in Cobalt-Thorium G making the planet uninhabitable for 93 years. The device is a deterrent which will be triggered automatically in the event of nuclear attack. Muffley seeks the advice of his director of weapons research Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers in a third performance), an ex-Nazi scientist based loosely on Werner von Braun, representing the fascism in the machine still present almost 20 years after the war who is excited at the prospect of nuclear annihilation and the human race surviving down the bottom of mine shafts. If every character is a cog in the human machine, he is already very visibly half-machine, confined to a wheelchair and struggling with a gloved robot-like hand which has a life of its own.

The film is told in linear almost real time and continues unrelentingly to its despicable conclusion, but stressing repeatedly Mans fault for what happens. Ripper starts the problem, and when Mandrake tries to call the President having intuited the recall code for the planes he is delayed by an army officer with the ridiculous name of Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) who hesitates to shoot the lock off a Coke machine to get change for the public phone. When Mandrake does get through and the planes are recalled, all planes acknowledge except Kongs B-52 which due to human initiative has managed to dodge a missile aimed at it. Muffley assures Kissoff that if he puts everything into the sector of the planes primary and secondary targets then the plane will be shot down, but the B-52 has been hit, is losing fuel and so is going to a new target unknown to anyone outside the plane. Finally, the Russian doomsday machine is a nuclear deterrent that would only work if the whole world knows about it, but Kissoff loves surprises and fails to tell everyone in time. In this way, at every stage mechanical man combined with human error (in Kongs case this codes as initiative) ensures nuclear annihilation is inevitable.

Kubricks stunning treatment of Swiftian satire ensures that throughout the film the wicked humor is delivered in dead-pan fashion with none of the actors laughing. In this way the serious is made to look ridiculous and the ridiculous is made to look serious. The spectator is caught between laughing at the outrageous situations and gasping at the scary implications of events as they pan out. Kubrick proceeds by introducing things seriously only to undercut them comically. The off-screen narrator announces with grave seriousness the SAC defense system with its B-52s permanently air-born in case of an emergency only to follow it up by showing the pilot of one of the planes (Kong) reading Playboy magazine and another crew member playing cards. We expect the pilot to be a serious type, but as soon as he opens his mouth his Texan drawl announces a cowboy. Whats a cowboy doing piloting a B-52? As he prepares himself to respond to the go-code he dons his magnificent cowboy hat and drawls laconically, This is it boys. Nuclurur combat toe to toe with the Rooskies! John Wayne was mooted for the part after Peter Sellars said no to a 4th role, but Slim Pickens is perfectly cast here to the extent that once seen we can imagine nobody else in the role. Then, when we are first introduced to Turgidson it is through his private secretary Ms. Scott (Tracy Reed) lying on a hotel sunbed in the same pose that we have just seen her as Kongs Playboy centerfold. The big news that Ripper has flipped is relayed by her to Turgidson who is in the bathroom. A playmate should not be the secretary of the Chief of Staff just as the Chief of Staff should not be giving important directions while voiding his bowels or even giving them through his bowels. And so it goes throughout the film, Kubrick continually pulling the rug from underneath serious situations with subversive humor which all the characters fail to see, but we surely do!

The comedy is rich and arises mainly from 3 themes that snake through the film seeming to connect the 3 locations as much as they are actually sealed off from each other  food, sex and infantile regression. The opening credit sequence captures all three at once as the child-like graffiti credits appear over two B-52s, one re-fueling the other to the song Try a Little Tenderness. The images connote sex as well as a mother giving suck to her baby. Kubricks cutting of the concluding custard pie fight in the War Room weakens the food connection, but we still notice food omnipresent throughout. Following the B-52 feeding her baby we notice the seriousness of the radio operators relay of the attack order to Kong undercut by speaking through a sandwich he is stuffing into his mouth. When Mandrake collects a radio from inside a machine we notice an apple and a banana left there. When Ms. Scott relays the telephone conversation to Turgidson we notice reflected in the mirror behind her the remains of a meal, and in the War Room one side of the triangular construction is lined with a long buffet where we can see amongst other food those custard pies that were eventually cut. When Sadesky arrives he asks if theres fresh fish and settles for poached eggs. When Kong dishes out the emergency pack supplies prominent among them are rations for 4 days. Ripper never eats but he talks endlessly about bodily fluids and his idea of the Commie conspiracy contaminating ice cream with fluoride. Turgidson spends the entire film chewing down on gum as if it were cud providing for an endless series of hilarious facial expressions, and the concluding scene has him and Muffley sitting in front of the buffet drinking away as Dr. Strangelove gets excited talking about slaughtering cows for the mines.

Anthony Macklin has noted the films progression from foreplay to explosion, the continuing sex metaphor dominating the way these characters think and act throughout. If the foreplay is the credits sequence, the explosion is the final orgasmic doomsday ride as Kong straddles the nuclear bomb like a giant phallus as he waves his hat and plays the rodeo rider plunging to oblivion. We eventually learn that Jack D. Ripper (the name of the most notorious sex-murderer in history) is sexually somewhat unbalanced, confusing post-coital depression with impotence. This caused him to blame the Commies for sapping his bodily fluids and so he retaliates sexually  by sending bombers out to kill the sappers, by smoking a huge phallic cigar which shrinks as the film goes on, by replacing it with a machine gun and then a pistol with which he blows his own brains out. The films most priceless moment comes when Ripper makes his big speech, Kubricks camera low looking up stressing the mans huge cigar suggestive of huge potency as he asks Mandrake, Do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war? He said war was too important to be left to the generalsBut today war is too important to be left to the politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought. I can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration, communist indoctrination, communist subversion and the International Communist Conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. The words are completely logical and suggestive of a strong, responsible mindset belonging to those die-hard grass-roots anti-Communists of the day until that is those last 3 words where he is revealed as a crackpot. As said Kubrick gives us plausible seriousness delivered seriously, but then pulls the rug from under our feet which causes us to belly-laugh at something that oughtnt be funny at all. Sterling Hayden gives an inspired performance throughout  how he could keep a straight face during this speech simply amazes me!

Prior to his phallic ride to the ultimate orgasm Kong has been reading Playboy. When the safe is opened to get the Plan R attack profile we see porno pictures on the door. When he dishes out the survival kit in addition to food there are lipsticks, nylons and prophylactics and Kongs famous line, Shoot, a fella could have a good time in Vegas with all this stuff. (Vegas was changed from Dallas because of the JFK assassination). Their primary objective is given as Laputa which is not only a flying island visited by Gulliver (thus making the Swift connection explicit) but the Spanish word for whore. Sex is also uppermost in Turgidsons mind as he leaves a sore Ms. Scott telling her to start her sexual countdown and be ready to blast off on his return. Scott also calls him at the War Room, her sex drive as difficult to satisfy as Turgidsons. Then right at the end his face lights up at the prospect of living at the bottom of a mine shaft with a ratio of 10 women to 1 man. In the War Room there also sits a President with a rude name  both merkin and muffley are names for the female pudenda  but his head is ironically bald and phallic-like. His opposite number in Russia is named Kissoff and then most sinister of all there is Dr. Strangeloves darkly erotic sexual nature. As the President sits on a chair rendered impotent by the machine he has lost control of, Strangelove gets excited at the prospect of mineshafts to the point where he stands up from his wheelchair, a throbbing human erection signifying a sinister future for the human race.

Even more than food and sex we notice infantile regression increasingly dominates proceedings, especially in the War Room in the three way relationship between Turgidson, Muffley and the Russians. Turgidson starts off carefully, but his over-enthusiasm for a pre-emptory nuclear strike is pure child with childish language and body gestures to match. On the Russian reaction to the American attack he says, they are going to go absolutely ape, and with face twitching and eye-brows executing gymnastics he outlines Rippers hope for an all-out American attack which will catch em with their pants down! He accepts the Russians may still retaliate, but he minimizes the damages with Im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed. Tops. Depending on the breaks. George C. Scotts performance here has to be seen to be believed, cutting to the essence of the jingoistic military man in a brilliant way which is both realistic and completely off the wall. The childishness continues with his objections to Sadesky entering the room (Hell see the big board!) followed by schoolyard name-calling (Kissoff is an atheist Commie rat) and then the slapstick highlight of the film where he wrestles with Sadesky over a spy camera which causes President Muffley to reprimand them with the classic line, Gentlemen, you cant fight here, this is the War Room! We notice Turgidson doesnt just regress to acting the infant (he was that already in the hotel room with Ms. Scott), he regresses back to being an ape. The Russians are not the only ones to go ape in the film as he assumes increasingly simian postures, huddled over clutching his book World Targets in Megadeaths, standing on a chair for a prayer which gets rudely interrupted and then losing control of himself completely as he imitates (arms spread out) a B-52 landing perfectly when asked by Muffley if Kongs plane can still get through before he remembers where he is and his apologetic hand comes up to cover his mouth. Scott was reportedly angry with Kubrick for printing the takes where he was only practicing with what he thought was over-acting. Kubrick even retained one take where he accidentally falls over and continues to talk completely in character. He may have complained, but his performance is absolutely brilliant as he was later forced to admit. Peter Sellers is also brilliant, all 3 of him. As Mandrake he is in his element doing a British upper class twit accent. At Burpelson he is the voice of reason as Ripper rambles on madly and Bat Guano equally madly defends the sanctity of private property. As Muffley he excels playing him as a mild-mannered liberal in the image of Adlai Stevenson, the UN ambassador during the Cuban missile crisis. His great infantile regressive moments come in two beautifully judged telephone conversations with Kissoff, the first a series of hilarious childish exchanges (.its good to be fine) in which he speaks to a drunk Russian premier in the manner of an adult addressing a 4-year old infant: Now Dmitri, you know weve always talked about the bomb Kissoff hilariously directs him to Omsk information because hes forgotten the phone number of the civil defense agency, and then they waste precious minutes competing to be sorrier than the other. We never hear Kissoff, Sellers getting the conversation across on his own with inspired lunacy. The way he hesitates slightly before announcing Russia is about to be annihilated is again priceless. The second phone call is more fraught as they worry over the loose B-52  Im not hysterical, says Muffley hysterically to an equally hysterical Kissoff. And of course his advice to put everything youve got in those 2 sectors and you cant miss, is completely wrong. Sellers third character Strangelove is also very effective for me though other people seem to disagree. He gets the mad German scientist down pat especially when we recognize the Fritz Lang connection. The glove and wild hair comes from Rotwang, the mad scientist in Metropolis (1927) while the wheelchair comes from Hagi, the master criminal in Spione (1928). And we mustnt forget that in 1964 it was a brave insight to make that fascism was still with us despite Hitler having died 20 years before. If people call Sellerss portrait infantile then that is precisely the point. This is a film where the masters of the world are unmasked as infantile herdmen blindly following mechanized procedures which doom them to ultimate destruction. Such is the nature of modern man says Kubrick (echoing Nietzsche), the rot having set in during the 18th century enlightenment to which Swiftian satire was the natural response.

With so much conceptual brilliance concentrated into the script and the acting the visual side of Dr. Strangelove may seem relatively low-key, but Gilbert Taylors cinematography and Ken Adams marvelous sets are extremely accomplished, suiting the text brilliantly. Kubrick asked Adam to design sets with ceilings, set-ups to be source-lit either from the side or from below. The three main arenas are therefore dark with characters tending to lean into the camera with ceilings bearing down oppressively. Extreme whites and blacks are accentuated making for a threatening series of images  Ripper rambling on nonsensically with Kubricks camera looking up capturing his profile with the huge phallic cigar, Turgidsons simian postures caught again from a low angle as his bulk seems to bully the whole War Room, and Dr. Strangelove caught in the shadows as Turgidson says his prayer about the valley of fear. The triangular set for the War Room is inspired with its darkness enveloping a huge round poker table and the computer maps which loom down pressurizing everyone. The visual presentation is in the usual Kubrickian diametrically opposite manner. In the War Room the talk is increasingly animated and out of control so Kubrick captures everything with static cameras, use of wide angle lenses, sensing the drama coming from the actors. In the B-52 the actions of the crew couldn't be cooler and more mechanized and so Kubrick adds the drama with a handheld camera which he operates himself. Similarly, the outside fighting sequences at Burpelson are handheld while the office with protracted scenes between Ripper and Mandrake are as static as the scenes in the War Room, the drama again allowed to come from the performances. A lot of people might at first object to the artificial use of model planes shot in front of projected images (actually shot over Norway) for the B-52s protracted run into Russia, but everything falls into place when Kong rides his phallic bomb at the end, a sequence that could only be artificial. With all the artificiality that precedes it, the sequence doesnt jar at all, the natural culmination of everything that has happened.

Finally, perhaps the thing that raises Dr. Strangelove to the level of genius is the films passionate anger, an anger which is so essential for Swiftian satire to work. Kubrick is clearly not happy with a power structure which allows for nuclear warfare and in this film he voices his exasperation at the state of modern man that things should have come to such a sorry state. His perception has always been essentially misanthropic and later this view leads to an icy-coldness which remains brilliant, but becomes somehow passion-less. Here, he seems to be amplifying out of the humanism shown so skillfully in Paths of Glory. That was a film set in two spaces which define one another  the French chateau where the generals play with each other, and the trenches where men pay the price for their games. The films humanism is present in the voice of Colonel Dax who gives us a clear moral viewpoint condemning the generals and forcing us to sympathize with his men. The angry protest is carefully articulated and was so successful that the film was banned in France for many years. Dr. Strangelove adds a third space to the equation. The French chateau becomes the War Room, the trenches become both Burpelson and the B-52, but the figure of humanism is removed. Dax has no equivalent in the film as everyone becomes extensions of their machines with no humanity involved at all. Kubricks misanthropy lies right here, but because he uses satire (in which characters are stripped of personalities and made into comic cyphers) he is able to retain the passion and the anger is allowed to hit home with resounding success. Scary, hilarious, despicably brilliant, as a film Id say its nigh on faultless.",1519171200,,23923,4.939130434782609

7696409,5,B01D3LBCAE,"DR. STRANGELOVE is a black and white movie about ""The Bomb.""  The movie stars George C. Scott, Peter Sellers, and Slim Pickens.  For those not familiar with Slim Pickens, countless Americans have been thrilled by his comedic charm in Spielberg's epic movie, 1941. George C. Scott plays General Turgidson, who is played in an exaggerated cartoonish manner.  Sterling Hayden plays General Jack Ripper, who plays an unpleasant paranoid character, who likes to talk about ""precious bodily fluids.""  General Jack Ripper eventually shoots himself in his quarters.  Keenan Wynn plays Colonel Bat Guano, and in this movie, he resembles the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  His ""big scene"" in this movie is to shoot a hole in a Coca Cola machine in order to get change for a pay telephone, and out of the hole comes a gush of soda that douses Colonel Bat Guano (in the same humiliating manner as the humiliation showered upon the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off).  The Coca Cola scene occurs at 73 minutes.

Dr. Strangelove begins with an image of a remote island poking above the clouds, with the narration, ""For more than a year, ominous rumors had been privately circulating among high level western leaders, that the Soviet Union had been at work on what was the ultimage weapon, a doomsday device.  Intelligence sources traced the site of the top-secret Russian project . . . to the perpetually fog-shrouded wasteland below the Arctic peaks of the Zerkoff Islands . . . ""

SEXY FUELING SCENE.  Then, at the 75-second time point, begins footage showing the fueling by a tanker jet to a bomber.  Some of the footage shows a side view of the two jets, which are connected to each other by the fueling tube.  Some of the footage was shot where the camera was pointing out the rear fueling door of the tanker jet, and in this shot, the viewer is shown how the fueling pipe thrusts in and out and in and out of the receiving device of the bomber.  The music is romantic Montovani music.  After a couple of minutes of this amusing sexual innuendo, the plot starts.

We see an airforce base with radar antenna rotating, and a bomber taking off.  Then we see a general conversing with Peter Sellars. ""The base is being put on condition red . . . I'm afraid this is not an exercise . . . I'm afraid this is a shooting war,"" says the general.  The general is General Jack Ripper.

At the 6-minute time point comes visually appealing footage of bombers flying over snowy mountain peaks.  At 6 min, 30 sec, we see Slim Pickens in the pilot's seat in the cockpit of a bomber reading Playboy Magazine.  At 8 min, his crew consults a codebook, and Slim Pickens and his crew discuss ""Plan R.""  Slim Pickens converses with another crewman, saying: ""Did you say using Attack Plan R? . . . how many times have I told you that I don't want no horsing around on the airplane . . . well I've been to one world's fair, one picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard coming over a set of earphones . . . you sure you got today's code? . . . there's just gotta be something wrong.""  Slim Pickens looks at the control panel which reads: FGD135.  Then, he looks in the codebook, and notices that FGD135 matches up with Attack Plan R.  At 9 min, 45 sec, we see fellow crewman James Earl Jones (as we know, he later played the voice of Darth Vader).  At 10 min begins a steady drumbeat and trumpet playing, ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home.""  (This is on the soundtrack whenever we are shown the inside of Slim Pickens' jet bomber.)  Slim Pickens says, ""Well boys, I guess this is it.  Nuclear combat, toe-to-toe with the Ruskies . . . lokk boys, I ain't much a hand at giving speeches . . . I have a fair idea of the personal emotions you might be thinking.""  (At this point, Slim Pickens has put on his cowboy hat, and he speaks into a microphone.)

BIKINI SCENE.  Then, at 12 min, we are in General Turgeson's suite and the viewer is treated to many views of his secretary in a bikini.  The two of them talk about Plan R.  For three entire minutes, the viewer is treated to images of the slender secretary in a bikini.  At 16 min, we see Peter Sellars in the computer room at an air force base.

BODILY FLUIDS.  This movie has a few references to ""precious bodily fluids.""  The first reference occurs at 24 minutes in a talk in General Ripper's office by the general to Peter Sellars. At 46 min, General Ripper says this to Peter Sellars, ""fresh pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.""  This takes place in a discussion about fluoridation being a Communist plot.  At 56 minutes, the dialogue goes, ""foreign substances introduced into our precious bodily fluids . . . that's the way a Commie works.""  At 60 min, Peter Sellars remarks that there was never anything wrong with his ""bodily fluids.""

SURVIVAL KIT.  At 35 min, the scene changes from the tense situation in teh war room to the comedic situation in the bomber piloted by Slim Pickens.  Comedy comes from the perusual of the items in the survival kit.  The itemsinclude, vitamin pills, morphine pills, sleeping pills, Russian phrase book, Russian ruples, prophylactics, nylon stockings, etc.  The sound track features a harmonica and snare drum.  Slim Pickens remarks, ""Shoot!  A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with that stuff!!!""

At 51 minutes, the character of Dr. Strangelove make his entrance, and the discussion is about the Doomesday Machine.  Here, Dr. Strangelove (played by Sellers) speaks to the President of the United States (played by Sellers).  At 61 minutes, General Ripper kills himself in the bathroom, thus bringing to a halt his chit-chat session with Peter Sellers.  The scene then changes, and we are with Slim Pickens in his bomber.  The problem is that a Russian missile approaches, and it damages the bomber.  At this point, Peter Sellers needs to call the President of the United States, but he does not have change for the pay telephone, and the viewer is treated to the Coca Cola scene (described above).  At 68 minutes, Slim Pickens continues to fly his damaged bomber and he says: ""If we was flying any lower we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.""

At 82 minutes, James Earl Jones notices a problem with the bomb bay doors.  They won't open.  So Slim Pickens decides to go down to the bomb bay to open them manually.  Slim Pickens orders James Earl Jones to ""fire the explosive bolts"" but this does not work.  And so, as the snare drums continue, and as the horns play ""Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" Slim Pickens plays his very, very, famous ""Yee-hawwww"" scene by riding one of the nuclear bombs out of the bomb bay door, where it eventually explodes. Then, we hear the sone, ""We'll Meet Again.""  The real reason I bought this movie was to see if it was the recording by The Byrds or the recording by Vera Lynn.  I was disappointed to learn that it was Vera Lynn's recording, not the recording by The Byrds.  Oh well.",1512086400,,6942,4.57085020242915

7696414,5,B01D3LBCAE,"For those that have not seen the movie, which is highly unlikely, this is an improbable situation where a base commander is in the position to order an attack on Russia. Originally supposed to be a serious movie based on the book ""Red Alert"" by Peter Bryant (really Peter George). Now converted into a black comedy with many great stars including Peter Sellers as there of the characters. (It would have been four characters if he has not broken a leg).

The DVD (special edition) is worth purchasing even if you have earlier versions. There are also later editions with a different mix of goodies. Many DVD's contain what they call extras (I call them Goodies). In a lot of cases they are just rehashed versions of the movie or just rattling. In this case the extra ""Inside the Making of DR.STRAINGLOVE"" rivals the movie itself for entertainment and useful content. You find out how the movie evolved from a serious piece to a serious black comedy. You find that the movie is an aggregate of many talented people. It would take too log to describe the details that motivated the movie so you will just have to purchase this edition.

There is also a trailer for ""Fail Safe"" a rival movie on the special edition.
Dame Vera Lynn ""We'll Meet Again"" (1942)

We'll Meet Again

 We'll meet again,
 Don't know where,
 Don't know when,
 But I know
 We'll meet again
 Some sunny day.

 Keep smiling through
 Just like you
 Always do
 Till the blue skies
 Drive the dark clouds
 Far away.

 So will you please
 Say hello
 To the folks
 That I know
 Tell them,
 I won't be long.

 They'll be happy to
 know
 That as you saw me go
 I was singing this song.

One part I found interesting was when the Air crew was examining their survival kit. Slim Pickens says a person can have a good time in Dallas with the kit. This is over dubbed by Las Vegas as a result of JFK just being shot in Dallas.",1502064000,,1882,4.402332361516035

One of my favorite films of all time I watch this at least once a year, and no matter how many times I've seen it, it does not age and always makes me laugh.  Seemingly no matter what is going on in the world or closer to home with politics, I think this cold-war masterpiece has never lost it's edge and it's relevance to what is going on whenever you watch it.  While the threat of destroying the world with nuclear weapons ebbs and flows, the debate about military versus civilian philosophy, sanity versus craziness, winning at all costs, and even the futility versus necessity of war has never stopped being relevant 50+ years after it's initial release.  You might be depressed at the end or you might be howling with laughter, but either one is the perfect response to Kubrick's masterpiece.",1485216000,19,1038,4.564516129032258

This brilliant satire of a nuclear thriller, showing men out of control, is one of the greats, (rated #51 of all time at IMDB) and Criterion has outdone itself on this production.  As is true of all Criterion releases, there are no coming attractions or advertising, there is top visual quality, sometimes with a full film restoration (though some of their earlier releases are not yet on blu-ray and many of the earlier releases lack the production standards of the more recent releases), there is thoughtfully designed packaging (though rarely as good as for this film), and always multiple supplemental features, often by film scholars or contemporary interviews with the director or crew, providing the context often needed to appreciate some of their releases. All of this is why some of us are willing to pay more for CC releases. (BTW, another large online store, which Amazon review rules do not allow me to name, has yearly sales every July where all Criterion releases are discounted to $20).

7696455,4,B01D3LBCAE,"Hello, Dimitri, uh...you know how we've always dreamnt about getting our hands on the ultimate Strangelove iteration.
The ULTIMATE version, Dimitri...
Well, ok, this one is fine - but not so great to be the long hoped for ""Finest"".

Oh, you know, good old Criterion got a little funny with it and it's rather over-priced; and larded with too many recycled add-ons.

So, then, is it definitive?
Is this a state-of-the-art circa 2015 digital transfer?

Mr. Reader, there are one or two points I'd like to make, if I may...

1. Great job at eliminating all the artifacts and damage and judder - it looks very clean!
Overall it looks smooth, but not as brilliant as I had hoped.
The image quality is good, but the grain still swims an awful lot in the War Room and General Ripper scenes.
Likewise, I am disappointed by the contrast in those relatively ""glamour"" lit scenes; they are not quite as crisp as I had hoped they would be. The density and contrast variations are, naturally, part and parcel of each scene's intention - differences in emulsion included.
Nevertheless I remain unconvinced that the sharpness of focus/resolution is all that it could have been overall.
(And yes, I have a fairly new 1080P Sony Bravia and have spent much time fiddling with the settings.)

2. Even after reviewing Criterion's transfer info I remain confused (or unconvinced) that this is the most up-to-date digital pass of Strangelove.  Just exactly WHEN was this 4K transfer from a combination of elements done?
On-board pamphlet says 2004 - yet, I preordered this version under the assumption that it was a more recent treatment.
Why?  Because of a renewtheaters.org missive from 2013 reporting what seems like a more current restoration pass (google it yourself).

Perhaps this is the best we can ever hope for, due to the loss of the original neg and mixed condition of the various prints that were scanned.  But Criterion should definitely have been more straight-forward about the status of this supposedly definitive product. They really should have included a VIDEO supplement describing he technical background of this digital transfer.
Otherwise...here we go again, as with the same sort of endless debating over the proper aspect ratio!

3. The revised mono soundtrack is terrific, as is the 5.1 Surround.  However, would have been nice for C to throw us a little technical bone, like the brief supplement on the last Psycho Blu-Ray, about how the 5.1 was achieved. Just sayin'...

4. Now for those SUPPLEMENTS --
Some old stuff, some fresh:
(Be warned: In them all you will be repeatedly subjected to the same low-rez clips from the movie over and over again!)
:
* Excerpts from a 1966 audio interview with Kubrick, which has been presented before, except this go-around has nice stills to accompany it.

* Mick Broderick describes Big Stan's development as a full-fledged film maker extraordinaire.  Worthwhile, thanks.

* Art of SK -  Another recycled bit from the 2000 DVD.  Usual talking heads treatment; some interesting, because they actually were there and worked with SK, others rather irrelevant (firm-grasp-of-the-obvious wise), pretentious or smug - and sometimes just plain inaccurate (courtesy of the faux-biographer Baxter. Whose lousy judgement do we have to blame for always having to suffer his presence on these?!).

* Joe Dunton and Kelvin Pike describe some of  SK's cinematographic techniques and predilections. Great stuff, but much too brief and too limited. (Why is that the truly fascinating technical aspects of film making always seem to get such short shrift, in comparison to all the rather pompous opinionating from those who always seem to think they have some special insight into the mind of the film maker?) Just askin'...

* Inside Dr. Strangelove.  An official SK archivist, Richard Daniels does a swell job of describing some aspects of SK's style that have been overlooked and minimized for far too long.  A welcome change from most of the predictable egghead pontificating that Criterion prefers to punish us with.

* No Fighting In the War Room  --  Speaking of punishment, this again from 2004.
Rather than describe some of Kubrick's sources for nuclear war strategy - the real history and thinking behind it (MAD, RAND, Kahn, Teller, von Neumann, etc.), we are presented with apologist Robert McNamara.  I suppose he does try to impart a degree of perspective without appearing too self-serving; but the irritating voice of Bob Woodward? Nothing to offer other than his cachet with the high and mighty. And then there are those other worthies that we simply had to hear from concerning the historical value of Strangelove: Roger Ebert and Spike Lee.... Really?
Combine obvious liberal bias with its usual laziness and add lack of imagination, result: this sort of lame attempt at relevance.
Ignore.

Long overdue: Peter George gets his due courtesy of a short piece featuring the reminiscences of his son. Yes, his contribution far exceeded Terry Southern's.

A Peter Sellers appreciation from some of his contempos; fawning praise that wears thin quickly. Some interesting bio stuff.  Also, a weird interview with the weird Gene Shalit - who Sellers could have a done a great impersonation of.

* Final new, but not so noteworthy, inclusion: a tedious Joseph Campbell Hero With A Thousand Faces talking head analysis. Yet another example of the drearily pedantic state of modern film interpretation. As if art really depends on having some assigned expert explain a fashionably favored insight in order to enhance its value or prestige for the rest of us. Arthur C. Clarke mentioned all this in 1970. Dull.

Throw in the miniature Plan R envelope with the faux Playboy Terry Southern (essay has been online for years) and the teeny Russian phrase book/bible stuff and you have, I suppose, the best available copy of Dr. Strangelove we will ever get.

7696459,5,B01D3LBCAE,"Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is Stanley Kubricks dark Cold War satire filled with great comic performances, three of them by Peter Sellers. A U.S. bomber armed with thermonuclear weapons and piloted by Maj. T.J. King Kong (Slim Pickens) is on a routine flight near the Soviet Union when it receives orders to begin Wing Attack Plan R  nuclear combat. The order was given by Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who explains he did it to take action against fluoridation, which he believes is sapping Americans bodily fluids. Pres. Merkin Muffley (Sellers) meets with his top Pentagon advisors to figure out how to get out of this sticky situation, while extreme hawk Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) sees this as an opportunity to strike a blow against Communism. The situation escalates when the Americans learn the Soviets have created a Doomsday Machine that will destroy the whole world if the Russians are attacked.

Made in 1964 just a few months after the Cuban missile crisis, this film was well timed to capture the paranoia of an era when schoolchildren routinely practiced duck and shelter drills and the build-up of nuclear weapons was regarded as the best way to defend nations. Despite the real threat that loomed daily, Americans went about their lives, having no choice but to hope that common sense would prevail and theyd live to see many tomorrows.

Dr. Strangelove shows how the act of one madman can put in motion a series of events that could lead to armageddon. Yet Kubrick manages to keep the tone light through the broad caricatures of the men in charge of protecting us. Even today, when the threats to America differ considerably from the one depicted, the movie packs a powerful punch.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray Special Edition include new interviews with Stanley Kubrick scholars and people associated with the film; excerpts from a 1966 audio interview with Kubrick; four short documentaries about the making of the film; interviews from 1963 with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott; 1980 Today show interview with Sellers; trailers; and a critical essay.",1468022400,2,2136,4.9415041782729805
7696460,5,B01D3LBCAE,"The Criterion Collection, a self-described continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, almost always publishes its selected films in high-quality editions with supplements worth having. Even without having watched any special features yet, I would say that with the new Criterion selection Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, which is the 821st Criterion title, the collection has outdone itself. The film looks great on the blu-ray format and the attractive packaging alone is worth mentioning. The front cover has the words of the full title forming the shape of a nuclear warhead being dropped by the U.S. Air Force. The back cover has all the usual information that Criterion provides, including original release date (1964), length (95 minutes), and aspect ratio (1.66:1). When you open the product, you will see one of the films iconic images  Slim Pickens as Major King Kong waving his cowboy hat in the air as he rides a nuclear warhead which has just been released with him on top of it. The disc itself bears the image of the end of a warhead, which reads the phrases nuclear warhead: handle with care and hi there!. Contained within a top secret envelope are three items. The first, of course, is the booklet, which is formatted to look like an old-fashioned Playboy magazine, complete with liner notes, a fake ad for vodka based around a brilliant joke from the film about fluoridation of water, and even a (nearly) nude photograph or two. The second item is a top secret document containing an essay on the film by David Bromwich, an English professor at Yale. The last item is a very miniature booklet labeled Holy Bible & Russian Phrases containing credits for both the film itself and this Criterion edition. With regards to the film itself, Dr. Strangelove was director Stanley Kubricks seventh film (he only directed thirteen full-length films in his five-decade career before his death in 1999 at the age of seventy) and was his first film to be nominated for Academy Awards. The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Peter Sellers in three different roles), and Best Adapted Screenplay at the 1965 Oscars but it won nothing, losing Picture, Director, and Actor to My Fair Lady. Kubrick was nominated for four Best Director Oscars (Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and Barry Lyndon) and three Best Picture Oscars (Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, and Barry Lyndon), but his only Oscar win ever was for Best Visual Effects in 1969 for 2001: A Space Odyssey. Despite having never won an Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director, Kubrick remains one of the cinemas most legendary filmmakers and Dr. Strangelove is without a doubt one of his best films. A fine example of Kubricks dark sense of humor, the film finds surprising ways to poke fun at Cold War anxiety. The plot focuses on the order for a nuclear attack on the U.S.S.R. issued by an insane general (Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper) and other characters various efforts to stop it, resulting in the films race-against-time structure. Over-the-top hilarity ensues in a series of ridiculous situations, such as Gen. Ripper explaining to Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (played by Sellers) why fluoridation of water is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face mere seconds before a round of gunfire comes through the window of the room they are in, or Mandrake ordering Col. Bat Guano (played by Keenan Wynn) to shoot open a Coca-Cola machine in order to have enough change to call the U.S. President from a payphone. The film also contains memorable quotes, including one that made the American Film Institute list of greatest movie quotes: Gentlemen, you cant fight in here! This is the War Room!. Included on the AFIs list of the one-hundred greatest American films of all time and ranking #3 on the AFIs list of the one-hundred funniest American movies of all time, Dr. Strangelove is more than just a brilliant comedy from a brilliant director. It is also a reminder to find the humor in any situation in life, despite anxiety. Thats what it means to stop worrying and love the bomb.",1467849600,32,4213,4.900560224089636

The movie itself is a masterpiece of satire, and proves to be one of Kubrick's best films. Definitely a must-buy for any dedicated fan of Kubrick or classic cinema.",1467417600,9,270,4.76595744680851

8754783,5,B01D3LBCAE,"It's always such a joy to open a new Criterion remastered DVD. For a film lover it amounts to the moment before you turn the corner on Christmas morning to see what Santa has brought for you. With Dr. Strangelove Criterion assembled a perfect 10. The film itself is beautifully restored. The extras are mouth watering - there is SO MUCH there for you to indulge yourself in - hours of extras. If you love the film, this is MUST have for your collection. Even if you have never seen it - and you should - this is the edition you want to buy. Thank you yet again Criterion for the amazing work that you do. For those of us who were born into a world that had just created a Doomsday Clock and all that the Cold War entailed, Dr. Strangelove gives us both a moment to smile and catch our breath with an equal amount of time to realize there's nothing funny about it at all and the threat only grows larger. A Kubrick masterpiece.",1526169600,,926,4.237288135593221

8754789,1,B01D3LBCAE,"This is NOT TRUE WIDESCREEN, IT IS CROPPED to make it look like WideScreen. I already had what I thought was a FullScreen edition of this movie and bought this Criterion version because it claimed to be WideScreen. This one is obviously LESS THAN THE ACTUAL MOVIE because the top and bottom of the screen is MISSING so that it fits the WideScreen ratio. The version I already had is apparently the original aspect ratio release, made before WideScreen became the common movie format. If this is the only version you can get, the movie is still worth watching, but beware that you are not going to see the entire picture.",1520985600,,620,4.594594594594595
