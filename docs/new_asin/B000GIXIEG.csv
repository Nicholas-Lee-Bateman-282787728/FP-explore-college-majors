8132954,5,B000GIXIEG,"I Bought this though I am still working on getting the whol Collection . Vol 2 is way better then Vol 1.

Because all of the matches are way better in Vol 2 then they where in the first volume.",1473379200,,193,3.825
8132955,5,B000GIXIEG,This is czw and other great death and extreme matches plenty of blood and all,1464652800,,77,4.2
8132956,5,B000GIXIEG,"This DVD is a truely fantastic deathmatch DVD. It features CZW matches from one of the early TOD events, plus 2 cage of death matches. The action is well shot and easy to follow, with the exception of the cage of death matches at times, but that's the nature of those matches. If you like deathmatch wrestling, this is a great choice for you, but if you call it garbage wrestling, maybe try a PWG or ROH DVD",1458691200,,407,4.230769230769231
8132957,5,B000GIXIEG,I love Death Match Wrestling. What are you waiting for? You love Death Match Wrestling to. So place your order now! Thank you.,1390089600,,126,4.521739130434782
8132958,5,B000GIXIEG,"This dvd is a 5 star for any hardcore wrestling fan. Those men are not your average wrestlers from WWE or TNA. Those men are sick and hardcore animals from your backyard wrestling show. They use many dangerous toys on each other like glass sheets, barbed wires, flaming tables, bats, bowling balls, chairs, light tubes even a weed whacker. My favorite match is Wifebeater vs Necro Butcher. Necro Butcher is like the Mick Foley of ROH, so they used many dangerous toys on each other and Wifebeater slammed Butcher through 5 flamming tables, 2 chairs and a sheet glass from the top of a truck for the pin. If you are a hardcore wrestling fan not a fan of that stupid and low rated present WWE or TNA, buy this.",1357603200,,708,4.453846153846154

8132960,5,B000GIXIEG,"This DVD Is Awesome. A Great Selection of Matches. They're Almost All CZW Matches Except The Two Bonus Matches. There Is Lots Of Extreme Hardcore Wrestling Action To Be Seen On This DVD. Every Weapon You Can Think of is Used, Everything From A Glass Light Tube To A Plastic Snowman To What has to be a 52"" Flat Screen HDTV. My Favorite Match On Here Is Probably Necro Butcher Vs. Wifebeater, An Awesome Match With An Amazing Finish.

Bottom Line: If You Like Hardcore Wrestling And I Mean REAL Hardcore Wrestling, Do Like It Says On The Back Of The Case, ""Watch This DVD, You Sicko. You'll *Censored* Love It!""",1201046400,,610,4.495495495495495
8132961,5,B000GIXIEG,"After seeing the 1st and 3rd best of the deathmatches DVD's I had very high hopes for this one. I am always worried I will be disappointed.

Necro Butcher vs Nick Gage- Just a sick hard hitting affair. They are using sheets of glass, and we see some sick moves. The finish is just amazing. Grade A-

Mad Man Pondo vs Wifebeater- I don't think Pondo is very good. Wifebeater came out and put on a great show, another hard hitting affair. Grade B

Sexxxy Eddy vs The Arsenal- Just an awesome match. Both of these participants are very good wrestlers and they combined a good wrestling match with light tubes and garbage cans. We also got to see a wicked finish. Grade A

Necro Butcher vs Wifebeater- WOW!!! Just an amazing hard hitting match. When they started they ahd glass panes, bardwire, weapons etc, but the floor of the ring was covered in 4 inches of broken glass. So many huge spots that where sick. I am amazed they could continue. The end of this match might be the best finish ever. Grade A+

Mad Man Pondo vs Toby Klein- This was a solid match. It was hard hitting and fairly fast paced, however nothing too special. The ending was interesting it was a new weapon I had not seen used before. Grade B

Wifebeater vs Necro Butcher- Here comes a rematch! This match came before the other match. Another hard hitting match with tons of weapons. This one doesn't have as many high spots, but it is an enjoyable match. Grade B+

Wifebeater vs Sick Nick Mondo- This match featured 200 light tubes, barbwire, buckets of salt, and a weedwacker?! WOW! Within the first 5 minutes of the match Wifebeater's back is soaked with blood, and Mondo's back has five, 2ft scars across his back. The weedwacker finish is really amazing. Grade A

Zandig Vs. Necro Butcher Vs. Nick Gage- Brutal 3 way, everyone weapon I can think of was used. Necro was a bloody mess; I don't know how he kept going. Just crazy Suplex onto a board with barbwire, a sheet of glass that was set on fire. Nick Gage was set on fire and its amazing he could continue. Nice finish! Grade A

Nate Hatred & Nick Gage vs. Justice Pain & Wifebeater- The H8 club vs the H8 club. This match featured 2 steel cages loaded with weapons. This was a great match from start to finish and at the end we see a surprising turn of events. Grade A-

The Blackout vs Team Cash- Just amazing! This match features a war games style cage of death between these 2 teams. There are so many high spots, I just cant mention them all. After 25 minutes of total enjoyment, one member gets eliminated?! Wait what? A whole team has to be eliminated to win? WOW! I don't know how Jack Evans didn't kill himself. Grade A+
Joker, Necro Butcher & Toby Klein vs. Zandig, Nick Gage & Justice Pain- Everyone in this match was ripped to shreds. It was hard to tell some of them apart since they where drenched in blood. Klein's back was just torn up. Necro's face was a bloody mess. It was really sick. Grade A+

Supreme vs Angel- Even though Supreme dominated for most of the match, it was a good match. Angel got a few wicked shots in with some light tubes, and really opened up Supreme. Angel was soaked in blood at the end. Great finish! Grade A

Crazy Boy & Joe Lider Vs. Xtreme Tiger & Super Crazy- I think this match was on the 1st DVD. This was a good match, hard hitting, but with a lot of high impact moves. Grade B

This DVD was just flat out amazing. So far the first 3 DVD's in this series are just the best you can find. Every match is great and most are amazing. Most DVD's that say they are 3 hours long, but are 2 hours and 31 minutes rounded up. This DVD was 3 and half hours of pure hardcore entertainment. Pick this up and enjoy!",1188691200,7,3679,4.291486291486292
