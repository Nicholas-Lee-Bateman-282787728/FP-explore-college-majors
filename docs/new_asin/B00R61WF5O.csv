8694245,5,B00R61WF5O,"Raw emotions keep the kettle aboil in ""Broadchurch"" (2013), a sixteen-episode series set in the small tourist-friendly seaside town of the title on the southern coast of England. The double case whodunit observes all the formal conventions of the mystery genre: the helpless victim, the shock of the affected parties, the dogged effort of the detectives, the suspicious behavior of likely culprits, the enigmatic clues, the red herrings dragged across the trail. What distinguishes ""Broadchurch"" among the proliferate, often intricately clever, species of murder mysteries is the emphasis on character over plot and the searing portrayals of emotional distress in all concerned, the investigators as well as the investigated.
  Police procedure, forensic science, and legal conundrums are crucial to the proceedings but take a back seat to the foreground anguish, outrage, grief, indignation, lust, hysteria, rancor, remorse, mistrust, guilt, and see-saw relations among the characters. The web is complex and deep; every strand plucked reverberates the whole.
  An eleven year-old boy is found dead, lying face down on the beach. The town constabulary has been assigned Alec Hardy (David Tennant), a new chief inspector with a damaged reputation to repair. His detective sergeant Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman), lifelong resident of the town, had expected promotion but instead must work with the the taxing, abrasive new boss. Many of the possible suspects cannot or will not account for their movements. The local press has an eager young reporter willing to compromise journalistic integrity to win his spurs, while a heartless professional from a London daily has been dispatched to steal the story. Commercial interests worry that the paparazzi might scare off the tourist trade.
  A past unsolved case haunts Inspector Hardy, the murder of a young girl and disappearance of her baby sitter that was allegedly botched when the detective carelessly allowed critical evidence to be stolen. Both cases devour him and drag in reluctant Detective Sergeant Miller.
  Local inhabitants in the simmering town of 15,000 know each other painfully well. Their concourse lends itself to undigested jealousies, long-tended grudges, and half-hidden secrets. Their intimacies and loyalties are threatened and tested by the murder investigation. Coincidences and cross purposes abound.
  There is, for example, a personal rivalry between headstrong defense attorney Sharon Bishop (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and arrogant prosecutor Jocelyn Knight (Charlotte Rampling), her former mentor. Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill), himself not beyond the reach of the investigation, treads carefully among thorny issues presented by his parishioners, while his offers of spiritual solace fall on stony ground.
  Chris Chibnall created the series for Kudos Film and Television. The Wessex location, with its restless sea, its towering cliffs, and its claustrophobic village, provide visual tension to the accumulating suspense. Sweeping panoramas of verdant fields and sparkling waters in the bay promise that life endures in spite of human agonies.
  Sparks fly, passions flame, and fevers never cool in this gripping, intoxicating series.",1490745600,2,3219,5.679166666666666
8694246,5,B00R61WF5O,"While I don't own this version, doing some research on review and technical sites like blu-ray.com leads me to believe this set should be playable in the U.S.  But be clear, I cannot personally vouch for that.

The first season was one of the best mystery-based shows on television for a very long time.  For me, The second fell off to 'only' very good. My 'film diary' notes below

Season 1: This show is a case where there was a real reason for all the critical acclaim.  This terrific 8 part TV mini series is an intense multiple character study and social commentary wrapped in a murder mystery.  Made in the UK, its excellent in every department, from the performances to the writing to the direction and cinematography.  Rich to over-flowing with character detail and arresting images, and accompanied by a notably effective and haunting score, Broadchurch shows how a small town is pulled apart by the unsolved killing of an 11 year old boy.  Generally, our main focus is on the two detectives trying to solve a crime that has lots of possible suspects, but no clear culprit.  But the series spends much rewarding and moving  and sometimes even gut-wrenching - time on the victims family and their grief, as well as the shock that runs through the town itself.  We can only watch sadly as the town is slowly engulfed by ever growing paranoia as everyones dirty little secrets are uncovered, either by the police or the press.  The final  pay-off is fulfilling enough, but as with True Detective the real satisfaction is in the richness of the characters and their world -- the unwinding of the tale, not its wrap up.  There are a couple of tropes that were a little too neat for me  for example the way the two lead detectives are perfect opposites; an optimist and a pessimist, and insider and an outsider, etc.  Its cleaner than the generally wonderfully morally complex and messy world thats been created here.  But thats a minor complaint about a major work, and the two actors playing the leads (David Tennant and Olivia Colman) give such rich performances that ultimately it transcends the few clichs that pop up.  This is a truly haunting piece of story-telling.  In a way it feels like a ghost story -- where the ghost is a dead child whose memory haunts everyone.  I find images and moments have stuck with me for weeks, and I very much look forward to going back and seeing it again, now that I know the tragic secrets of the various citizens of Broadchurch.

Season 2: Still an intelligent and suspenseful character study/mystery piece, but this second season lacks the complexity and the ring of truth of the first.  Incidents feel a bit more convenient or manufactured, a few of the twists are disappointingly obvious and theres less of an organic sense about the whole thing.  It's almost like you can feel the creators struggling to think up a direction to go after the 1st season and pieced one together pretty well, but it doesnt have that thrilling sense of springing out of deep inspiration.  The acting is still on a very high level, and the 5th and 6th episodes get back to the kind of amazing film-craft that the first season overflowed with.  But too often this felt like a good network procedural stretched out to 8 hours.",1460764800,5,3253,4.654991243432574
8694247,1,B00R61WF5O,"Was sad that the DVD ,although blu ray, was not operable for the USA. So had to return it. Still waiting for the refund. Also had to pay 12.95 to mail it back to Great Britain. Our bluray is only 6 months old, but the Samsung was not multi region. Even so, the reviews on multi region were iffy on the DVD still working. Broadchurch , I have found out in hindsight, that season 2 is not being released in USA.",1433548800,3,409,4.061728395061729
