8003859,1,B0000VLKTY,What the hell?? From the description it sounded like a good movie! In reality its got to be the worst movie ever!! I couldn't even hardly sit through it! The acting sucked. The Story Sucked. The Plot Sucked... Ooops I am sorry I made a mistake THERE WAS NO PLOT!! I wish I never would have watched it! Unless you want to see flashbacks of the main charectors mom giving herself and aportion with a coat hanger then I don't recomend this movie for anyone. It would have been alot better if daryl hanah's charector died in the end. At least then maybe you would get some sense of satisfaction out of watching it.....I am the only person I know that has atempted to watch this film and actualy sat through the whole thing. I thought 'well maybe it will make sense if i watch some more' I was wrong..... You would have to pay me at least $50 to sit through it again!,1097884800,,862,4.262195121951219
