1951734,4,B0000V4906,"This series was inspired by the film ""The Egg and I"". Very simply, city slickers try to make it running a farm. The episodes are absolutely hysterical, and the public loved it: it ran for six years with high ratings. I believe the key to it's success is the clever writing. Also crucial is the fact that Eddie Albert's character is the only sane person in the whole town of Hooterville, yet HE IS THE ODDBALL, because everyone else is WEIRD! A lot of the humor is surreal: a pig that watches TV, chickens lay square eggs, an impossibly incompetent county agent, the phone company installs their phone on the top of a pole, etc. Lots of sight gags appear.  I love how some episodes make fun of the credits.  In one, the credits appear as Eva Gabor's dream, she wakes up asking ""Who is Richard Bare?"" (he directed practically all the episodes). The series is way ahead of it's time. Now is the time to enjoy it, with the whole first season packed on 2 double sided discs.",1074124800,3,969,4.407821229050279
1951735,5,B0000V4906,"Green Acres is up there among the greatest shows in television history, one of the most surreal programs ever.  I have to admit I was indifferent to the series when it was first on when I was a kid.  But  in the late 90s I began watching it on TVLand and couldn't believe what I was seeing.
Green Acres is a grreat example of meta art, and its self-referential qualities are quite amazing.  Talk about post-modern, at one point Eva Gabor commented on the opening credits that were being unveiled in front of her.  This is a 60s cultural artifact that's every bit as important as Roy Lichtenstein and Warhol.  And on top of all this, it is a hilarious show, extraordinarily clever and witty.  Eva Gabor is a trip, and Eddie Albert, a great and very underated actor, is perfect as the representtaion of sanity.
Green Acres rocks my world.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD!
 I am extremely thankful to have the entire first season in my possession.",1074038400,7,955,4.505813953488372

1951738,5,B0000V4906,"Oliver Wendell Douglas, a Manhattan attorney who has long wanted to be a farmer decides to buy a rundown farm from con man Eustice Haney. He then returns to New York City to get his stuff and bring his beautiful socialite Hungarian wife Lisa with him. Once they are in Hooterville, Oliver hires Eb and they try to build the farm into a useful venture. In the meantime, Lisa becomes acclamated to her surroundings and attempts to bring some form of civility and at the same time spice up the down-home backwards place she was forced to live in. She ends up becoming friends with all the neighbors and even strikes up a friendship with Arnold, the pet pig of Fred Ziffel, who treats Arnold like a son. Arnold even watches TV and is in many ways smarter than the Hootervillians.
Frank Cady aka Sam Drucker played that same character on Petticoat Junction and whenever the Beverly Hillbillies went back home.
In fact many characters bounced around between Green Acres and Petticoat Junction.
This programme was traditionally thought of as just another of the cornpone country comedies that CBS used to be noted for, like ""Petticoat Junction"" ""Andy Griffith"" or ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". But with its button-down straight man, Eddie Albert, surrounded by a wild assortment of extraordinary oddballs, ""Green Acres"" looks both backwards to the screwball comedies of the '30s and ahead to the Bob Newhart series of shows which followed a similar premise.
This show was to be the obverse of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and instead turned out to be perhaps the most surreal TV show ever done in on American TV.

1951740,5,B0000V4906,"This release is very welcome; the show is possibly the funniest TV show of all time. Silly, strange, surreal...and laugh out loud hysterical. Don't hesitate to pick this up!",1073260800,2,173,5.0
1951741,5,B0000V4906,"Whenever I try to tell people about Green Acres, I come up short for suitable words. I tell them it's a mind-bender. I tell them it offers the most twisted logic known to man. Non sequiturs run rampant. One liners and sight gags abound. It practically induces a headache whenever I watch it.
Yet, I'm going to order Season One of this fascinating show today.
Why? Two reasons: (1) It -- like Lost in Space (another absolutely classic and essential DVD set I'll order today) -- is a slice of my childhood. I was five when Green Acres debuted. I remember watching it in the late '60s and early '70s, mostly in reruns. I loved it. I've waited for its release literally for decades; and, (2) It's a monstrously creative show, with a flamboyant style that puts to shame the tepid sitcoms of today.
I haven't yet seen a single episode of this DVD set. But I rated it 5 stars out of sheer gratitude to whomever had the guts to release it. I can't wait!",1072742400,20,945,4.375

Granted, it is being played on Ch 9707 (Guardian) at 6:30pm for those who subscribe to Sky Angel via Dish Network.  But I don't have Sky Angel...
Long story short, I am writing to say that there were 32 episodes in the first season (according to tvtome dot com).  Amazon doesn't say how many episodes are included in the DVD set, but it is titled the ""Complete First Season"" so I will be pleasantly surprised and thoroughly pleased to be able to pick up 32 episodes for a mere $27.99!!",1070755200,3,659,4.306451612903226
1951743,4,B0000V4906,"CBS struck prime time gold in the 60's with a string of rural based comedies, that ran for a decade. First came The Beverly Hillbillies, followed by Petticoat Junction, and then Green Acres.

Hilarious and memorable, Green Acres' opening credit sequence and theme song (sung by the two lead actors), explains the show's premise. New York lawyer, Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert), seeking to live out his dreams of becoming a farmer, leaves the Big Apple for the rustic paradise known as Hooterville, accompanied by his loving, but ditzy wife Lisa (Eva Gabor). The cultural clash between urban and rural lifestyles, is nearly the reverse of that in found in the Beverly Hillbillies.

At its heart, Green Acres is all about dealing with cultural differences. Farmer Douglas is an idealist, struggling to find his way, in a place he doesn't understand, where absurdity is commonplace. Often put in the role of the one sane man in an asylum, he deals with people, customs and situations that often defy reason, leave him bewildered, and severely test his patience and sanity.

To the inhabitants of Hooterville, Oliver and Lisa are ""city folk"", that strange breed, who have a different way of looking at things. Among the eccentric populace are Department of Agriculture agent Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore), part salesman, part conman Eustace Haney (Pat Buttram), farmhand Eb Dawson (Tom Lester), and model neighbors, the Ziffels, with their pet pig Arnold. This eclectic group and more, contribute to the comic madness that is Green Acres.

Green Acres has a remarkably consistent point of view, as series creator Jay Sommers and his writing partner Dick Chevillat, combined to write almost every episode, with Richard Bare serving as director.  As the first season unfolds, there is a sense of progress and improvement, as the Douglas' get telephone service, and thanks to the Monroe brothers, expand their tiny bedroom, which featured the couple sleeping in the same bed (rare for 1965).  Originally working off of generator power, the Douglas farm finally gets permanent electrical service, late in the season.

Eva Gabor is fabulous as Lisa, a good-hearted woman who innocently butchers the English language, and possesses dangerous culinary skills.  Eddie Albert is very good as Oliver Douglas, a dreamer who unfortunately has little talent in his chosen avocation.

While something of an acquired taste, if you think Green Acres ""is the place to be"", and want to say goodbye to city life, and enjoy a hearty taste of farm livin' the 32 episodes in the first season add up to over 13 hours of this classic bucolic comedy.",1069718400,20,2624,5.055555555555555

1951817,5,B0000V4906,"This is a very helpful series. For all those people that read ""Home and Garden"" you now have a program that shows the upside to farming.

This is the Complete third season, consisting of 696 minutes of run time; so I suggest that you start early in the day if you have to work tomorrow. And do not be too impulsive and rush out to buy that farm. The package comes with two DVDs and a pamphlet describing in brief each episode. However you better have good eyes as both sides of the DVD are recorded on, leaving no room for labeling.

Fort many this is the first time to be introduced to such strong acting characters as Arnold (rumor has it became dinner at the end of the series). For the rest of us, we have an opportunity to visit old friends and see an episode or two that may have been missed. With any luck we will have the opportunity to buy the next season.

Oliver Wendell Douglas, born on a farm, and stayed there for two days, wants to get back to his roots. The opportunity arises and he purchases the Haney place from Eustace Charleton Haney himself. His wife gets the opportunity to share with him the challenges to adjust to the farm life?

Go for it and get all three seasons now. It never loses that something that makes you addicted to the series and want more.

There is an urban legend that when the series finished Arnold became lunch.

If you appreciate this fine program than you will enjoy reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes, where the story is retold Italian style.",1503619200,,1503,4.35

1952034,5,B0000V4906,What's not to like? Good clean fun. Seems all Hollywood can put out today is sex and potty mouthing. Many very good modern movies were made only to be spoiled by a totally unnecessary nude or sex scenes or cussing.,1451001600,,214,4.375

1952040,2,B0000V4906,"MGM has done an absolutely terrible job with this product. I have the first three seasons, and for ALL of them the plastic flipper has broken on the inside. Even beyond that, the discs are very difficult to remove from the case. It's an annoyance to deal with every single time I want to watch an episode. Other annoyances are the MGM and other logos that show before and after every episode. There are also very lame menus that do nothing but spoil the endings of most episodes.

But by far my biggest complaint is that the discs themselves have problems. Again, I have three seasons on disc and virtually every single disc has playback errors. It isn't every episode. It isn't even most episodes, but it is multiple episodes on both sides of almost every disc. And it happens in both my PS3 and my laptop, so it isn't the player. That is inexcusable, and the only reason I haven't demanded my money back is that I discovered these problems too long after I purchased the discs.

So buyer beware. You may think you have finally purchased your favorite show on DVD, but you're only getting part of it.",1445472000,2,1101,4.5

For some reason, season one is only available to purchase each episode individually. So if you are a fan of the show, I recommend you buy your favorite episodes.

1952384,5,B0000V4906,"I had just started third grade w. Then Green Acres first debuted on CBS back in 1965. But I didn't become fan of the show until the Molly Turgis epiisode seven months later. Eva Gabor was the main reesason why I watched the show. I was just simply captivated by her beauty, charm, and glamour, and she became the idol
f my youth. I even collect pictures of her from the Green Acres days.

Of all the pictures that I have of Eva Gabor, my personal favorites are when she was photographed wearing this very sexy light-colored print strapless gown (even though they are black and white pictures), a medium-sized choker necklace, tiny droop earrings, and a beautiful satin stole that was wrapped around her; just below her bare shoulders. Her beautiful blonde hair was so styled so perfectly and so chic, and of course, she had that beautiful, bright, and very sexy smile.
She was photographed standing next to her husband at the time, Richard Brown; and they looked so happy together.

This may sound crazy, but I look at these pictures whenever I listen to the music;  the music of the 1960's, when both Eva and Richard were married; especially the Motown artists (Diana Ross and the Supremes, the Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, etc.) It just makes me feel good all over.

1952424,5,B0000V4906,"Listen - we know we are not alone when we say reality TV has hi-jacked network and cable television and most of it isn't really a positive force in life with its usual focus being on the nastier side of the human condition (fighting, jealousy, lying, cheating, etc. etc.) and at some point we have simply given up - so what to do after?  We became our own T.V. station!

We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!

Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).  But not everything is what it seems when Mr. Haney sells him a piece of useless land, a broken down house, an 'antique' tractor, and everything else one might need.  When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).

  Green Acrs is one of the Cleanest and Funniest Shows ever made. It's Writing is intelligent and simple at the same time.
I bought a month ago,return to Green Acres, on DVD. I watched it the Mommet I got home. It was heartwarming and sweet.
My only fault with it was that the ydidn't do another Reunion Film. I recall watching the Reunion Film when it premiered in April 1990.
I must have watched it 3 times even way back then.

  I own Seasons 1,2 and 3 on DVD. I must have wathced each of them at least 5 times over.
As soon as I watched one episode, I would fast forward past the creadits on the next episode and keep right on going. One day I wemt on a binge and watched 4 hours of episodes.
  I know there is another Sampler Compiliation for sale out there. I haven't picked it up yet.

  Why isn't there a Complete Series Mega-Set DVD Complilation of Green Acres all in one Box ?
 That would save money on the packaging,etc...
A Green Acres DVD Megaset would be a Hit Sellerfor the Family at Easter Time and at Christmas as well as all Holidays.
It is a show you can watch with yoru kids and family members of all ages. That is how clea nand wholesome it is.

1952505,5,B0000V4906,"Paul Henning was a tv genius. Two of his greatest hits was ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction"" and he was executive producer on this show created by Jay Sommers and scripts written by Sommers and Dick Chevillat. This is a weird, kooky and wonderful show. It's the reverse situation of ""Hillbillies"" wherein the Douglas's move from an apartment in Park Avenue in New York to a farm in a hick town called Hooterville.
Eddie Albert, a very, highly talented actor,who could play any role,comedic,serious,cowardly or menacing to perfection,plays Oliver Wendell Douglas who dreams of leaving the rat race of the big city and owning his own farm. Eva Gabor played his feather-brained wife Lisa,who seemed to fit in well with the Hooterville locals but yearned to be back in the big city with all it's stores. I have only seen Ms Gabor act on this show but,she is cast perfectly. The actors on the show are also perfectly cast. You believe that they are really like the characters they portray. There are the  Ralph and Alf Monroe brothers. One is a woman. But it sounds better on their carpentry business. Husband  and wife Fred and Doris Ziffel and their son Arnold. A pig. Then there is Mr Haney the country con-man that will sell you anything only to have it break down two seconds after you buy it. Eb Dawson is the help on the farm and is like an adopted son. He see's himself as just that and calls the Douglas's Dad and Mom,which Oliver objects to. Sam Drucker is the local store owner played by Frank Cady and whose character also shows up on ""Petticoat Junction"" as this is like a companion piece to that show. Hank Kimbell is the bumbling county agent. Last but not least is Arnold the pig. Arnold loves watching TV especially westerns,can write and goes to school. I said this was a kooky show. It also has a great theme song by Vic Mizzy.
Their are some ingenious ways the credits appear on screen in some episodes. It has to be seen to be believed. They appear on Lisa's hot cakes,bath robes,towels,even distracting the actors in which one scene Mr Ziffel says let's stop until the credits have rolled as nobody is paying attention to us. There are loads of great wise-cracks in the show like the one where Arnold the pig brings a boy home from the orphanage. Mr Ziffel asks the boy his name in which the boy replies ""Pretty Boy Floyd"", to which Mr Ziffel replies ""We're used to Arnold bringing oddballs home. That's how I met Mrs Ziffel"".
This show plays like Oliver Wendell Douglas in Wonderland with out of this world plot lines. Watch this with your kids or grand kids. They will love it.
They have only released the first three seasons on DVD.It does not look like they will release the final three. Which is a great shame.
I think this is one of the greatest shows of all time.

1952510,4,B0000V4906,"The second-spinoff from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction"", Paul Henning's GREEN ACRES completed his 'Hooterville Trilogy', and is arguably the best sitcom of the three.

Successful lawyer Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert) and his glam wife Lisa (Eva Gabor) pack in their hectic New York lifestyle for what promises to be a laid-back country farm in Hooterville...but which turns out to be anything but!  As Oliver and Lisa soon discover, their neighbours are well-meaning but have very little going on in the common sense department, and everything that Oliver and Lisa touch seems to turn to disaster!

Several ""Petticoat Junction"" favourites made welcome regular guest appearances (likewise, Oliver and Lisa frequently crossed over into ""Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction""), but GREEN ACRES can easily operate without it's parent series.  It's all thanks to the chemistry of Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor...this show is a masterpiece because of them.  Although she had made countless appearances on television at this point in her career, who would have pegged Eva Gabor for a leading role in a sitcom?  As you'll discover as GREEN ACRES unfolds, she was one helluva good sport!

Eleanor Audley (the voice behind the villainesses in Disney's ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"") is Oliver's mother Eunice; this first season also includes frequent guest appearances from ""Petticoat Junction""'s Edgar Buchanan (Uncle Joe) and Bea Benaderet (Kate Bradley).

This double disc set includes all episodes from the debut season.

The airwaves were full of shows like The Andy Griffith Show, Petticoat Junction, F Troop, Daniel Boone, etc.  This one stood out with it's cartoonish depiction of city people and rural characters.  A man who was raised in a wealthy family to become a corporate lawyer in New York fulfills his dream of becoming a farmer and buying a farm no one in his right mind would buy.  His high class Hungarian born wife stands by him.  The acting is cartoonish and the plots are too.  The jokes are hit and miss but everything comes together in one neat 26 minute show.

1952590,4,B0000V4906,"The show is as fun as I remembered. I did watch them a couple of years ago on Nickelodeon. I taped them and watched them as I got time. I saw the show as a kid as I was born in 1960. I was very young but do remember the series when it was on tv. That is why I wanted to own this set really. I bought seasons 1-3. The first episodes the characters are still finding themselves as far as playing the role goes. Lisa smiled and laughed a lot which was funny and odd at the same time. She was such a beautiful woman and perfect for the part though.

Here are a couple of things that bug me. I guess I just didn't remember the laugh track being so obnoxious. Even when something happens that isn't funny, the laughs kick in. They are louder than the voices. I ended up having to turn down the volume and live with the voices being not quite as loud as I had wanted. I know the laughs were original but I sure  wish they weren't there! Also after you watch an episode all the way through, there is too much junk at the end. MGM advertisement, Orion pictures, you name it. While one might be original, all of them aren't of course. Then they have DVD info as far as who mastered it, plus FBI warnings at the end of each episode. I am not sure why they thought they had to put this at the end of each episode. It is really annoying. I have found though, if you hit the fast forward button at the end, it will skip over it to the main menu. Still you shouldn't have to do that.

Now on to other things. The show was new of course and they were finding their way. In maybe the 2nd or 3rd episode, Lisa was chasing a Rooster around and the lady from the Shadyrest Hotel came up and told her you won't get an egg from him. Lisa said, oh a man chicken! Funny. But a couple of episodes later, Mr. Haney was trying to sell them a Rooster and they said they didn't have one or want one. So where did he go? Then the guy who plays the plumber is the same guy who plays one of the Monroe brothers who works on their house later. I guess they recycle these characters or find out they liked their work so put them in another role later. I am being picky. I watch a lot of this old stuff and find things like this all the time.

The first season has no extras. I was hoping for some. Still if you want the epiisodes in good color and quality, this is the only thing you will want to buy.",1199836800,,2367,3.9559748427672954
1952591,5,B0000V4906,"I got this season of GA for Christmas and have watched about half of this season's episodes so far.  All that I've watched has played well despite the fact that 2-sided discs are part of the set.  No subtitles of any kind, but I'm glad to say this season is indeed closed captioned in English, which really helps.  I never got to see any of GA with CC before.  The CC has helped me enjoy this show so much that I went ahead and ordered the other released seasons (2 and 3).  Will check back when I finish watching this season.  If trouble-free viewing is any indication, I believe I'll have nothing but good things to report here.  Thanks to the great cast of this rural sitcom!  Hope to get the entire series on DVD, and since the 3rd's been out I'd say it's a matter of time before the rest is released.

Update: I finished this season about 2 weeks after I posted the review here.  Good things to report here, well most of it: finished it without a hitch and the closed captions all worked well.  The episodes, that is.  At first, between the episodes I'd hear a female voice but never understood it as the CC didn't appear every time.  When I did catch it, I realized it sounded like Eva Gabor saying ""This has been a Filmway Presentation, darling"" and the Filmway logo is shown here.  But no biggie.  The background music used in the menu featuring Arnold the pig sitting on an opened mailbox was so amusing, sometimes I'd hear it while I prepare something in the kitchen before I sit down to enjoy the show.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this season.  Go for it.  P.S.

1952624,4,B0000V4906,"The ""Green Acres"" (Series One) boxed set consists of two double sided DVDs comprising the first 32 episodes that aired in 1965 and 1966, as well as a small introductory booklet featuring a brief paragraph synopsis of each episode.

The strength of the set is their superb video and audio transfer quality, the box's own presentation and, of course, the great comedy TV serial itself. ""Green Acres"" itself was derived from a radio serial (CBS's ""Granby's Green Acres"") that preceded it. Revivals aren't something new. The classic  TV version lasted until 1971. My guess is that in some fashion or other it will be revived again. And aren't there are some parallels between ""Green Acres"" Hooterville and ""Northern Exposure"" Cicely? ""Green Acres"" is formula comedy, but it's a formula that works.

Another strong point. As another reviewer here has noted, one advantage of the boxed set is the ability to see the episodes in order. This rarely happened in their commercial television broadcasting and, my guess, is that few viewers would have known that there is a definite story arc running through the series.

The weakness, would seem to me to be, the use of double sided DVDs. Frankly I'd prefer single sided disks as I feel they are more durable and less prone to accidental damage.

There are no ""extras"" in this DVD set. This seems to me to be a shame. There is a great deal about the cast and production of ""Green Acres"" that modern fans would probably love to know.  For example, Pat Buttram, ""Mr Haney"". He was singing cowboy Gene Autry's comedy sidekick from the old ""Melody Ranch"" days. ""Lisa"", Eva Gabor's life and career, although not a stellar actress, certainly made her a celebrity. And one both more talented and attractive than modern ""multi-media celebrities"" like Paris Hilton. And classier too.

However, for my money, I would have liked some more celebration of the life and times of Eddie Albert. Eddie's real life has some fascinating parallels to his fictional ""back to the farm alter ego Oliver Wendell Douglas. Eddie was a backyard ""organic gardener"", growing much of his own food subsistence style in suburban Los Angeles. Where Oliver moved to Hooterville to live his ""down to earth"" dream, Eddie did it in the city. Where Oliver was something of a ""Crusading Lawyer"", prone to make long winded and empassioned speeches, that invariably were lost on his Hooterville audience, the real life Eddie was an activist espousing causes ahead of his time. Today we're used to Hollywood celebrities backing the latest environmentalist campaign. Sorry Bono, but Eddie was there first and before the broad based public appeal of green causes, made  ""celebrity activism"" a revenue enhancing career move. And sorry Mr. Clooney, Eddie was not the kind to fly his private jet to a ""save the Earth"" concert. Eddie, at the very least, practiced what he preached. Eddie was truly an environmentalist well before the modern ""green movement"" hit pay dirt.

And according to one account, at least the one circulated in Wikipedia, it was Eddie Albert's birthday that was the day chosen for ""Earth Day"". The other rival birthday ""claimant"" here is allegedly that of Russian revolutionary tyrant Vladimir Illich Lenin. I think I prefer the Eddie Albert.",1189123200,3,3256,4.959633027522936

1952666,5,B0000V4906,"I wonder if young people know that once upon a time, there were television shows that explored fantasy rather than relentlessly recounting reality - or a redundant simulation of it.

I wonder if they realize that there were writers and actors hired to use their imaginations and create parallel universes where horses talked (Mr. Ed) and Goth families struggled to properly raise their kids (The Munsters).

If you miss fantasy TV or if you are too young to remember it but have had enough of competitions and immunity challenges, GREEN ACRES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is for you.

Running almost 14 hours and packed with 32 episodes in order of their broadcast, this DVD tells the surreal story of Lisa and Oliver Wendall Douglas. A Park Avenue lawyer (Edie Albert) and his Hungarian socialite wife (Eva Gabor), the Douglases leave their Mondrian-decorated Manhattan penthouse and buy a run down farm in Hooterville.

A fictionalized fantasyland, Hooterville is populated by an ensemble cast of country eccentrics from a millionaire pig to a self-contradicting Department of Agriculture representative, to name just two of the dozen or so lovable kooks who continuously baffle Mr. Douglas, a wannabe farmer.

Although his wife makes no bones about her preference for city life, Lisa here masterfully plays the good wife, who cheerfully tries to make a glamorous go of country living while wearing cocktail dresses and baubles.

With a DVD this long, it is impossible to succinctly describe what to expect from GREEN ACRES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON other than to say that it delivers a highly recommended rip rollicking tour of a fictionalized Middle America.

I still believe that this was one of the funniest things ever to happen on TV: quirky, character-driven humor that even today has me frequently laughing out loud. My kids love it, too, so I'm proud to be able to pass down one of the gems discovered in my earlier years. It's good, clean family fun.

There are few TV-series-to-DVD sets that I have considered a must-buy, but this is definitely one. With 32 episodes in the first season and 30 in the second, it is also an excellent entertainment bargain. If, and when, the other four seasons become available for purchase, I'll get them.

1952705,5,B0000V4906,"A spin-off of the CBS program Petticoat Junction (1963), Green Acres surpassed its predecessor in audience popularity - spending four of its six seasons as a Top 20 Nielsen-rated program. Its family-friendly humor puts Green Acres in the same nostalgic category as shows like The Andy Griffith Show, back when TV sitcoms were all about humor and not as serious as they would later become with the introduction of 1970s stalwarts MASH and All In The Family. The brainchild of creator Jay Sommers, writer for shows such as The Adventures Of Ozzie & Harriet and Petticoat Junction (where Green Acres characters Sam, Doris, Fred, and Arnold make their first appearances), Green Acres' unique brand of comedy lives on through a successful and ongoing syndication run, and its catchy theme song even captured the pop culture for a second time when Old Navy incorporated it into one of their trademark clothing commercials...

Green Acres centers around the life of a wealthy Manhattan attorney, Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert), and his elite socialite wife Lisa (Eva Gabor). When Oliver gets a hankering to live out his childhood dream of operating a farm, conman Eustace Haney (Pat Buttram) offers him the deal of a lifetime. Only the deal of a lifetime turns out to be a 160-acre dump in the fictional town of Hooterville. Nevertheless, Oliver sets out to turn the farm into a rural gem, while Lisa is reluctant to leave her life of privilege in New York. Hired hand Eb Dawson (Tom Lester) helps out the Douglas family, and Sam Drucker (Frank Cady), a carryover from Petticoat Junction, runs the local general store. But the true life of the show emanates from neighbors Fred (Hank Patterson) and Doris Ziffel (Fran Ryan) and their adopted son - a prized pig named Arnold who displays many human-like traits. In time, Lisa learns to love the people of Hooterville, trying her best to bring sophistication to the backwoods region (and while still making use of her Manhattan wardrobe)...

The Green Acres (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Oliver Buys a Farm"" in which New York attorney Oliver Douglas decides to live out his dream of living on a farm. So, without telling his wife, he quits the law firm of Felton, O'Connell, Clay, Blakely, Harmon, Dillion & Pasteur (whew!) in favor of a rundown tract of land in rural Hooterville. When his wife Lisa sees the farm, she goes ballistic... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""You Can't Plug in a 2 with a 6"" in which Oliver must continually remind Lisa never to use an appliance(s) that will push the generator over a 7 on the power scale, and ""Lisa Bakes a Cake"" in which Lisa decides to bake a cake and ends up with a twenty pound cake...

1952706,5,B0000V4906,"Green Acres is one of my personal favorite shows. The show was so heart-warming and always put you in a smile. This classic that ran from 1965 to 1971 was created by the same people who brought other classic shows to television like THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, PETTICOAT JUNCTION, and MISTER ED. When I first received this DVD set, I was befuddled by the size of it. I thought to myself, how can so many episodes fit in such a small set? When I opened it, I discovered it was concealed on two double-sided discs. I have had my share of troubles with double-sided discs, and was worried that the same would happen here. Surprisingly, there were no troubles with it at all! In fact,they were the best double-sided discs I ever saw. The episodes themselves had some dust and grain, but what can you expect from 40 year old material? I think that MGM did a good job with this set. Not to mention the fantastic price!

**wink**

On January 13, 2004, attorney-turned-farmer Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert), his glamorous wife Lisa (Eva Gabor), and the whole Hooterville population became digitally enhanced and entered the 21st Century when this good-looking 2-Disc DVD set was released by MGM Home Entertainment.

This compact DVD package of ""GREEN ACRES: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" serves up all 32 color episodes from the initial season of this very funny rural sitcom. This boxed set is very nearly worth the modest asking price for the first couple of hilarious episodes all by themselves.

""Green Acres"" premiered on CBS-TV on Wednesday night, September 15, 1965, at 9:00 PM Eastern Time with Episode #1, ""Oliver Buys A Farm"", which introduced the American people to Oliver, Lisa, Eb, Mr. Haney, Sam Drucker, and Arnold (the smartest pig in the valley).

Announcer/Newsman John Daly (of ""What's My Line?"" fame) serves as ""narrator"" throughout the debut program, which was a very clever piece of casting by the ""Green Acres"" brain-trust. Daly's low-key, deadpan, and well-scripted narration is one of many highlights from the first episode. Utilizing Daly as a narrator here was a very inventive way of introducing the show's basic premise and cast of characters to the audience for the first time. Mr. Daly's commentary tells us just exactly why Mr. Douglas abandoned his fancy Park Avenue penthouse apartment and his posh New York lifestyle to take up residence on a ramshackle farm near Hooterville. ""Oliver Buys A Farm"" is one of the best (and funniest) debut episodes of a sitcom I can think of.

Other favorites of mine in this 1st-season compilation include ..... ""The Decorator"", ""You Can't Plug In A 2 With A 6"", ""Lisa Bakes A Cake"", ""The Price Of Apples"", and ""Never Look A Gift Tractor In The Mouth"".

The wild and crazy Hooterville brand of ultra-silly humor, as created by show executives Jay Sommers and Paul Henning, is present in full force in every episode of ""Green Acres"" (and its Hooterville sister sitcom, ""Petticoat Junction"").

MGM did a smart thing (IMO) with this first-season DVD set of ""Acres"", releasing the 32 programs on just two discs (both double-sided), thus keeping the MSRP for this DVD product as low as possible. It breaks down to just 65 to 75 cents per episode. Not bad at all, as far as I'm concerned! There are eight episodes per disc side.

And it appears that MGM didn't skimp on the picture quality of these shows either (despite the bargain-basement retail price). These episodes look quite a bit better than I expected. The video looks crisp and clear for the most part, with adequate colors. The opening credits are speckled with quite a bit of dirt and grain, and a few scenes within some of the episodes also suffer from their advanced age, with specks and dirt popping up occasionally. But this isn't overly distracting or annoying, in my opinion.

Plus: these first-season ""Acres"" episodes are presented here in complete, uncut form (as far as I am able to discern), with running times averaging about 25-and-a-half minutes per show.

No extra supplemental features are offered up within this set. But that's okay by me. For the price paid, I couldn't really expect any extras anyway. I'm very satisfied with this boxed set as is. Sure, it might have been nice if MGM had thrown in a couple of extra features -- like, say, half-a-dozen free Lisa Douglas hotcakes. Oh -- wait a second -- scratch that idea. (LOL!)

Anyway, as I stated, this set does just fine with just the 32 episodes themselves. Being able to watch Oliver Douglas out in his fields, on his tractor, while wearing a three-piece business suit via the full Digital splendor of the DVD format is also a major positive attribute to be applied to this DVD release.  :-)

Some interesting CBS-TV trivia regarding ""Green Acres"" ...... The final first-season episode of ""Acres"" aired on the exact same night that another classic CBS sitcom, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", was wrapping up its five-year run on the network -- June 1, 1966. ""Green Acres"", as it turned out, actually surpassed the Van Dyke series by 12 programs (in total number of episodes broadcast before going off the air) -- 170 to 158. ""Acres"" aired for six total seasons vs. Van Dyke's five.

In terms of ratings, ""Green Acres"" was a winner right out of the gate -- rising to #11 in the Nielsen TV ratings in just its first year. During the show's second season, it ranked even higher (#6).

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS DVD COLLECTION .....................

2-Disc Set. ... Dual-Layered, Dual-Sided Discs. ... 32 color episodes from the 1965-1966 TV season, presented in ""Film Date"" (Production) Order. ... To differentiate between ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" on these discs, you must look for an ""A"" or a ""B"" printed on the inner ring of each disc side. These letters appear just to the left of the words ""Disc 1"" or ""Disc 2"". (Why the disc-makers couldn't have simply marked each disc ""Side A""/""Side B"", I have no idea. Many double-sided discs from different companies are like this, however. It's designed as a mini-""torture"" test I guess. But, it's not a huge deal, once you know where to look for the teeny-weeny ""A"" and ""B"" markings on each side. Without those letters on the discs, it really *would* be aggravating as all get out trying to figure out which side is which.)

Take a break from big-city life, like Oliver Douglas has done, and pick up this terrific two-disc DVD set of ""GREEN ACRES: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"". These shows are good for what ails you. (Unless, of course, your ailment stems from having eaten a few of Lisa's hotcakes. For that catastrophe, you'll need to purchase one of the DVD season sets of ""ER"".)  :-)",1106438400,17,6439,4.887970615243343
1952709,5,B0000V4906,"TV critics fancy themselves a superior lot; after all, they get to see anything & everything offered up on the ""boob-tube"" and believe they're the ones blessed with superior taste.  But the peculiar history of the series we're dealing with here really makes the rest of us wonder just how much the TV critics were fooling themselves.......and how ultimately useless their profession can often be.

There was a genius to the sitcom ""Green Acres"" that no other series, fore or aft, ever posessed.  Comedy is, and always has been, an exact science; and when the peculiar chemistry of this particular show first displayed itself to the viewing public in 1965, millions knew they were witnessing something revolutionary and original.  It was a huge ratings hit in its first couple of seasons--but, the critics?  Nah, they took it to be just another ""Beverly Hillbillies"" or ""Gomer Pyle"" and all that other ""mindless"" rural comedy fare.

""Green Acres,"" though, had its own modus operandus: that of the frustrated Everyman character, being driven slowly out of his mind while existing in a seeming universe of loonies......even his own wife!  Mind you, there were some adjustments to be made in this opening season, such as Oliver Wendell Douglas's wife Lisa evolving into a lovable ditz and blending right in with the other citizens of their adopted city of Hooterville, IL: their hired hand Eb, the local con-man (who sold them the farm) Mr. Haney, Sam Drucker the general-store owner, brother-sister carpenter team Alf & Ralph, county agent Hank Kimball (named after a town in Nebraska--betcha none of you city-slickers knew that, did ya?!), and the neighborhood pig farmers Fred & Doris Ziffel, with their ""son,"" Arnold.

Eddie Albert--who'll forever be the most underrated actor of all time--allows the viewer to have total sympathy with his Oliver Douglas character; every time he blows his stack, Albert gets a laugh.  And you find yourself laughing WITH him more than at him.  And Eva Gabor, as Lisa, is simply the Comedy Find Of The Century.....never mind HOW the producers coaxed her into starring in a sitcom (I suppose MONEY TALKS!!!), she's a true sport for imparting comic appeal to her role and playing off perfectly against Albert.

It took a little while for the show to REALLY get into high gear and start cranking out the classics: the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons achieved this.  The opening season, out of necessity, took some time establishing some rather complex plot points with individual episodes, like the one dealing with the Douglases' phone being on top of a telephone pole; the unfinished bedroom closet rendering their wardrobe potentially vulnerable to overnight theft (not to mention leading one directly to the sleeping couple themselves!!); their electricity being run completely by an old-fashioned generator outdoors; and their outdoor shower.  But the first season, happily, has a couple of true classics as well: the season finale, ""Uncle Ollie,"" in which Oliver's visited by his hippie nephew (who refers to hired-man Eb as ""Lil' Abner""); and ""Sprained Ankle, Country-Style,"" in which Oliver's laid up after falling through the roof and enduring a heart-wrenching frustration seeing his visitors and well-wishers eating all the food they brought him......just see if you don't make it through this episode without tears creeping from your eyes.

Fine presentation from MGM Video, though they COULD'VE differentiated each of the sides on the double-sided discs!  I'm pre-ordering the second season now, where the series REALLY hit the heights of classic comedy--in such episodes as ""Music To Milk By,"" ""It's So Peaceful In The Country,"" and ""Getting Even With Haney.""",1104796800,7,3711,5.161666666666667
1952710,5,B0000V4906,"""Green Acres"" was the ""Seinfeld"" of its day--a ""show about nothing."" Eddy Albert is terrific as the New York lawyer who moves to a rural town with his citified, ditzy wife, played with suitable silliness by Eva Gabor. Suddenly he finds himself the only sane person in a wacky, surreal dimension populated by small-town eccentrics.

Like ""Seinfeld,"" the show works on the strengths of the entire cast. The timing and voicing of the supporting actors is flawless, and they bring such life and even plausibility to their characters that you instantly suspend disbelief just for the fun of watching them.

Also like ""Seinfeld,"" you have to let ""Green Acres"" grow on you. The first time you watch it, you might think it's dopey, but if you give it a chance, you will quickly find it hilarious. And buying a DVD is worth the money because you'll find yourself watching it over and over and each time seeing something you missed before.

No matter what age you are, you'll get a kick out of this show. Go ahead, spend the money, you won't regret it!",1104192000,4,1042,4.6521739130434785
1952711,4,B0000V4906,"Although I grew up on this show I think this is probably the first time I have seen the episodes in proper order, and doing so I found them even more enjoyable than ever.

I was surprised to find that during the first 22 episodes the story actually develops in something of a logical progression, and while each episode is a self-contained story, the ridiculousness just continues to build from week to week as certain developments in one story are then further expanded upon in subsequent episodes.

The cast is fabulous and I especially love the cute hired hand Eb and shameless con man Mr. Haney. And although I recalled Eva Gabor as something of an airhead, viewing this show again as an adult I realize just how talented of a comedienne she truly was.

One of the things I really love about the show is the warm and loving relationship shown between main characters Oliver and Lisa. No matter how much at odds they may be during an episode, in the end it is their love for each other that makes everything alright and keeps them together in the face of every outlandish adversity that ""Hootsersville"" can throw at them.

And after having been bombarded with it throughout the subsequent decades of comedy, it now seems almost unbelievable that a show could be as funny as this and not have had to resort to a single joke about sex for the year's entire 32 episodes. I doubt that today's so-called comedy writers could manage that feat for more than about 2 minutes!

The first 22 episodes detailing the couple's first 6 months on the farm are very, very solid and gut-bustingly funny. Definitely classic comedy! I think that they must have all been plotted out before the series went into production and show a wonderful cohesion. Beyond that point, the show's scripts seem to lose a bit of their direction and become more of a hit or miss kind of affair for the season's remaining 10 episodes.

But Green Acres would go on into even zanier territory, and I hope we will eventually see all episodes on DVD. (I remember one in particular where Eb dreams of having a conversation with the Jolly Green Giant that is one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen on TV!)

As for the DVD itself, for some reason episodes 1 & 2 and 22 & 23 seem to be much more dirty and scratched than the rest and should have been cleaned up first. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the same opening credits which are also dirty and grainy have been used by MGM for every episode. Quit cutting corners like this MGM!! But other than this the remaining episodes all look quite good. I did get a bit sick of seeing that MGM lion roaring so loudly before every single episode though. How about just once at the beginning of the disc, MGM?

It was somewhat of a challenge trying to get the double-sided discs out of the package the first time without damaging them since the clips in the case are especially stubborn and don't release easily. Be careful!! But when you pop them back in don't push them as far in and they will come out easily after that.

So overall I would have to say that I'm overjoyed to have been reunited with an old favourite of mine. I give the show itself 5 stars, but the DVD only 3 stars due to the problems mentioned above.

I eagerly await further seasons on DVD, and also want to see season boxed sets of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and Green Acres' sister show ""Petticoat Junction"". For me they represent a kind of golden age of TV, when comedy didn't need to resort to being crude or offensive to be funny. Viewed from our jaded world of today, they seem to hold a kind of almost childlike innocence that I have to say I truly miss.",1102377600,47,3649,4.457271364317841

1952743,5,B0000V4906,"Great fun- even my kids enjoy it!  Oliver is the only sane person in town, but he's the one out of place and therein lies the craziness.

Few shows over the years have had as many varied and memorable characters as Green Acres...Mr. Haney, Mr. Kimball, Fred Drucker, the Ziffles, and Arnold the Pig to name a few.  It never relied on anything objectionable for humor, but used the skill of the actors and the storyline.

Green Acres, along with The Beverly Hillbillies, poked fun at us and our way of life and doing things and made us laugh- without ever taking itself seriously.  That's why it is a classic.

The transfer might not be excellent, but it is certainly adequate and does not detract from the show a bit.

It's a really dated show we have no show quite like it on today (save for Paris Hilton's reality show). I like Petticoat Junction better with it's larger female cast and more positive humor.

1952746,3,B0000V4906,"Green Acres was the opposite of The Beverly Hillbillies. Both series were created and produced by Paul Henning. On TBH,the Clampetts kissed their country life goodbye and said hello to city life in beautiful Beverly Hills,California. On GA,a couple left The Big Apple aka New York City for the country life. The wife(Zsa Zsa Gabor) reluctantly went with her husband. As the husband(Eddie Albert) in the opening montage sang,""You are my wife!"",Gabor sang,""Goodbye city life"". Then both sang,""Green Acres,we are there!"". Also in the montage,we hear the respective thoughts of Albert and Gabor(""the chores,the stores,fresh air,Times Square""). I'm more of a Beverly Hillbillies fan. In the real world,not many people would want to shift from city life to country life. TBH was a bigger hit then GA. Cable television's TV Land continues to air reruns of both shows. I first saw GA in reruns on Wometco Home Theatre in the late 70's before the channel aired two movies nightly.

Green Acres is a gem that originated in the late 60's.  It's something the entire family can watch without embarrassment.  This show is clean!  No offensive language!  Just plain humor.  And that humor was unique.  At least for the early years, and yes, like any show that runs more than a few years, at times it can get too stupid.

But there are some great comedic moments in this classic show.  The theme revolves on this town that lives by their own rules that only someone like Lisa can understand.  The show is quirky, the characters are memorable and the content is original and fun.  Each script tends to follow in the previous.  Sometimes, the show was so stupid that it was just down right funny!  That's what it takes...good writers and directors too.

However, I just came across a recent review of the DVD set from someone who doubts that the series pilot ever aired--and couldn't understand why someone would buy the series based upon that pilot.
As someone who grew up with ""Green Acres"" and was 11 years old when it premiered in 1965--rest assured, the pilot episode was broadcast twice by CBS during the 65-66 season. Some of us loved that pilot, and still do. Though just a kid when it first aired, I was delighted to see John Daly in that episode--he was very familiar to many of us as the moderator of the long-running series ""What's My Line?"" at the time.
The pilot may not be ""Green Acres"" as the show later evolved, but the quirky/offbeat humor that was to be a series staple was evident even in that initial effort--from the opening moments, it's plainly obvious that this program plans to march to the beat of a slightly demented drummer.
Paul Henning, the producer, already had two successful series airing on CBS at the time--""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction."" Any network executive worth his salary would have been silly to pass up on a chance for yet another hit series from this same individual.
End of history lesson/brief editorial--if you love Green Acres, buy the DVD set--it's well worth the price tag!",1076198400,7,1551,4.726937269372693
1952870,5,B0000V4906,"I don't have a lot to say that hasn't already been written about this show. I loved it when I was young and remember many summers watching it and The Addams Family during the early afternoon. It was easy enough to dismiss it as just another funny but mindless comedy that was played to death in rerun. Add the superficially ""hick"" nature of the show, and you'd think it would have just sunk into TVLand history. But as an adult, I realize that nothing could be further from the truth! Green Acres worked on so many levels that I never recognized. I can watch them as an adult and realize now that it wasn't just about funny farm people, a talking pig and a crabby city slicker out of his element. At the same time, my 6 year old daughter enjoys watching it with me for those exact elements. It can be enjoyed for its zaniness and slapstick, but it works equally well as an absurd, surrealistic twist on reality. I don't mean the latter in an ironic sense- you can look back at some old shows and movies and view them as absurd because they are so dated and simplistic. Not so with Green Acres- they clearly intended for the show to work on these various levels. And they succeeded without being remotely pretentious or contrived. I love the idea where a show exists within the realities of its own universe- The Simpsons, Drew Carey, Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm seem to follow this trend. The characters are literally insane and the world they live in defies all reality, but somehow they are able to exist and survive because everyone around them is exactly as they are. Mr. Douglas, the only ""sane"" person on the show, is the oddball and the one who has the most difficulty coping.
Speaking of Mr. Douglas, I didn't remember how obtuse and dense he was. He may have been ""sane"", but he sure lacked common sense and had a terribly idealistic and romantic notion of farming that was not shared by his neighbors in Hooterville. Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor  are incredibly likable personalities and  great comedic actors with just the right timing and dry wit. And what a great supporting cast- Mr. Haney, Mr. Drucker, Eb, Mr. Kimball the County Agent (the most insane one of the whole bunch), Uncle Joe, the Ziffels! The chemistry among the whole cast is perfect. I'd love to see bloopers from the show, because I don't know how they ever kept straight faces.
I also love the fact that these DVDs are available with so many episodes for such a low price. I've got to think that you could sell a huge amount this way- they seem to be scarce on the shelves at local stores, so people must be picking them up. I can look past the lack of extras or perfect picture/sound quality if they sell entire seasons of shows like this for such reasonable prices. I'm really looking forward to later seasons, when the show became even more absurd and into its own reality.
And you gotta love that opening theme song. Just try not to sing along with it. Just try it...",1075852800,12,2957,4.474074074074074
1952871,5,B0000V4906,"I decided to wait a week on the release of this DVD collection and buy it at our local Best Buy.  When I was finally ready to get it. I found out it was sold out there and everywhere I went.  I spent all day Saturday looking for it and after 6 stops finally found it at a record store in a nearby town(I guess one of the draw backs of living in Small Town America), and they only had two copies left.  I had no idea, and it pleases me to no end to know, that there is such a love and demand for this show.  It is, arguably, the best comedy show ever made for television (sorry Seinfeld).

1952874,5,B0000V4906,"Fantastic. I've been saying for a long time that I'd like to have
Green Acres on DVD, but I didn't think it would happen for a good while to come. I also figured...it would be released as a ""best of"" selection instead of full seasons and that it would be expensive. With so many 50.00, 60.00 and even 100.00 plus dollar sets out there that I'd like to get, I figured I'd never be able to work Green Acres into my budget. Yet, here it is at Amazon for twenty dollars. Amazing! The picture quality is just fine, with only minor wear showing in the opening credits. The DVDs also are burned on both sides...which I think is great. The set takes up less room than a single VCR tape. Extras are fun, but it's the shows I really care about, so the lack of bonus features at this price is no problem for me, in fact...I'm all for the no frills approach if it keeps the cost this low and I can have all  the shows I like at very decent quality. SOAP was released this way too, and I think it's fantastic. Oh, by the way, the show itself is still great. Gabor and Albert have been very underrated and overlooked when it comes to TV comedy couples. Now, how about Newhart, Bewitched, Petticoat Junction, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, and the entire first Season of the Lucy Show? I say, buy this set and show support for the low price, no-frills, entire season format.",1075075200,10,1353,4.264591439688716
1952875,4,B0000V4906,"Finally, the most sophisticated, bizarre, cork-screwed show of all time. Yes it starts a little slow, but that's only to show us what a mind-boggling world Oliver moves to. Once the citizens of Hooterville (get it?  got it.....good) show up, it's every man for himself. Some of the wittiest dialogue ever written for TV is in this show. And anytime Mr Kimball shows up, logic goes out the door. Buy it...watch it.....laugh yourself silly and share it with today's kids....They'll LOVE it....well not love it....they might.....NO...that was last week.",1075075200,4,550,5.179775280898877
1952876,5,B0000V4906,"I had already written once about this show, but that was before this compilation was released. Now, since I've viewed it, I was compelled to write again.
  Have true TV fans - fans of great television viewing - waited a long time for this? I know I have! I think that MGM did a fantastic job on this set! Both color and sound are pristine. I'm VERY pleased.
  Wouldn't it be great if these companies would see fit to go to work on other shows now, especially if this set, and perhaps Mr. Ed, Lost in Space, The Honeymooners and so on end up selling well? Could you imagine the possibilities? Both seasons of Car 54, the first 5 seasons of My Three Sons. (what we here in our little corner of the world affectionately refer to as The ""Bub"" episodes) Lesser known shows deserving release and the possibility of capturing a wider audience. (Anyone remember ""The Name of the Game"" or ""Cimarron Strip""?) Of course a company has to consider whether or not it would be cost effective to grant some shows a release, but still, it's nice to think that it could happen. And, who knows?",1075075200,6,1075,4.414141414141414
1952877,5,B0000V4906,"Well... I've been waiting for this First Season DVD set ever since I ordered the Columbia House video releases of Green Acres (late 1999-2001).  Columbia House chose to release the ""best"" of Green Acres in no particular order, which was disconcerting to a fan.  BUT, this new DVD set is released in broadcast order!  It's great to see the development of the characters and it's quite satisfying to see that by the 14th episode (""What Happened in Scranton"") all the characters have found their niche.
Some of the episodes have a few film scratches, but they are really minor.  The sound is brilliant (no scratches there!) and the color VERY vibrant!  I remember watching Green Acres re-runs as a kid, and didn't realize that the hay shoveled by Eddie Albert in the beginning credits was a green color.
Another reviewer mentioned the chemistry between Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor and I must also mention it.  Interestingly, upon seeing the two actors names, one would think that Albert and Gabor would have nothing in common and be a disaster, but... something ""clicks"" between them just right.  As the episodes move along, one can see that Eddie and Eva clearly TOTALLY ENJOYED each other and played off each other wonderfully.  In fact, watch closely at the conclusion of one of the episodes (I kick myself for not remembering which one), where Eddie and Eva are in bed and Eddie goes to turn off the light (and theoretically conclude the episode).  Eva leans over and TICKLES Eddie and he knocks the lamp off the table and he and Eva both laugh in an ""out of character"" way, all while the scene fades out and the end credits role.  You can just see that they had FUN while making these episodes.
The surreal comedy starts to ""creep in"" to these first season episodes, although it wouldn't be fully explored until later seasons.  By ""surreal"" I mean where the characters ""poke fun"" at their own show or others similar.  One episode starts with Eb milking Eleanor the cow while humming the theme song to the show!  Then at the conclusion he ""sings"" in Eva's voice, ""Dahling, I love you but give me Park Avenue!""  It's in the later seasons that things like the names of the director and producers appear in the opening credits on Eddie's towel (as he exits the shower), or appear in the darkness in Eddie and Eva's bedroom where she asks him who the names are, etc.
So, watch these episodes... enjoy them.  And notice that they are really sophisticated ""pokes"" at society as we know it.  Finally... these episodes (well, the ones halfway through the first season and onward) are REALLY FUNNY!  Don't be ashamed to LAUGH OUT LOUD!
Let's hope MGM releases all the other five seasons!",1074988800,103,2678,4.688034188034188
1952908,5,B0000V4906,This 32 episode DVD set of Green Acres may be the absolute best purchase that I've EVER made!!! HILARIOUS!,1074816000,4,106,4.631578947368421
1952909,4,B0000V4906,"Before fully, giving my opinion on this release, let me tell you how much I've wanted it. For the past 3 years I've been searching for this... here at Amazon. That's right, every once in a while I would bring up the 'dvd' section, type in 'Green Acres', and up popped Fried 'Green' Tomatoes and anything that had 'Green' in it or 'Acres'. And then one day to my surprise back in Dec. 03 it came up... Green Acres! I am there!
Ok. So now my discs have arrived... can't complain about that price point, the extras are absent but anyone that has any old time shows expected it, however, one of my discs were scratched. The packaging itself may have caused it, but it honestly looks like it's been played before or something. Impossible I guess, but that's how it appears. The actual packaging looks great and like the Outer Limits release they have squeezed a lot of material on each side of the disc, this I do not have a problem with... but should we have to watch that MGM Lion each time? A bit heavy handed... plus no chapter skips, get ready to watch the opening theme 32 times, which is a fun theme don't get me wrong, but to watch 3 or 4 shows in a row makes it tedious.
So, now I'm off to... 'the stores' and... 'the chores'!
Disc One - Side A: 2.5/5
This series starts off in a way I do not remember and I have no clue what they were going for with the narrator as a newscaster. It really isn't funny and it has no real meaning. The city parts are mildly amusing and I keep waiting for them to get to Green Acres. Once they arrived I am greeted with some fairly funny bits and I can see portions of the humor in which I enjoy; Mr. Douglas trying to teach Mrs. Douglas how to say 'Hooterville' and not 'Hoosterville' and Eb the handyman popping up after all that and asking them if they going in to 'Hoosterville'. A lot of that non sensical double talk I love quite a bit, sadly there isn't much here on Side A in that regard and the Mother character is not funny and is in too much of each show. As 'Side A' winds down I am patiently waiting for the Green Acres I remember and I am (so far) unimpressed, however I know television, a vast majority of shows start slowly, so I'm not overly concerned, and yet I wonder...
Disc One - Side B: 3.5/5
Ahh... ok, now we're talking. Right away the first episode of Side B showed me that the show was breaking its shackles. The business with the Wheat Bumps, the nonsense about the appliances really had me laughing and I must say the chemistry between Albert and Gabor is truly heartfelt. Plus you can see it in her smile, Eva is having a lot of fun with this show and that really that counts for a lot. I cannot think of a larger disaster than the chemistry between these two actors 'on paper'. You would think it wouldn't work at all and would be a real mismatch, but then again, maybe that's the beauty of it? And I must mention Eb, he is truly a great swingman for this show, much like the Goober or Gomer characters did for Griffith.
Still, having just viewed the balance of the episodes on this side of the disc, it is better than side A but still not on par with my memories, and I guess that's comman place. Some of the gags wear thin; Mr. Kimballs way of speaking, the door knob, and Mr. Haneys haggling come to mind as being funny, but shouldn't be used constantly.
Disc Two - Side A: 4/5
Well, in the interest of time/space I'm gonna wrap this up. I am about halfway through this side of the disc and really do not want to rush through this nor do I want this review to be 10 pages long, so I'll conclude with the thoughts that this series is really hitting it's stride now and I'm really having a good time. The humor is pretty much unparalleled on television or anywhere else for that matter, and if there is one thing Green Acres has shown me is just how unwatchable current comedies truly are. Television used to be rich fertile land but is now just about as fertile as the old Haney Place.",1074816000,4,3953,4.209486166007905
1952910,5,B0000V4906,"Personally, I don't care about the fact that 2 sided DVDs are used, that they are not marked very well, that there are no extras on the disks, that some of the scenes are a bit scratchy -- or any other complaint you can make about this set.
What I like, no LOVE, is that I can watch 32 episodes - an entire season - of one of the best TV shows ever, at my leisure.  I am trying to pace myself so that I don't get thru the whole set too quickly, but I am having a hard time doing that.  I have been waiting for this for years!!!

1952912,3,B0000V4906,"First, I must say I am biased, as I have always considered ""Green Acres"" to be one of the most underrated sitcoms of all time. The surreal sequences make it unlike any other ""rural"" show, and it is funny yet today.
But, alas....the transfers on these DVD's leave something to be desired. The primary fault is during the opening sequence....the classic theme song. The opening sequence is spattered with scratches and dirt. It also appears they used the same source for the opening for all of the shows, as the dirt and scratches are amazingly alike on every episode. Given the classic status of this opening sequence, I am surprised they didn't put more effort into making it spotless.
I am not through every episode yet, but the majority of the episodes have average at best transfers....not as dirty as the opening, but not spotless either.
Of course, given that this is the one and only time these episodes will probably ever appear on DVD...snatch them up if you want them. Just be forwarned....it's not perfect.",1074470400,45,1016,4.778409090909091
1952913,4,B0000V4906,"It's tough to describe Green Acres to people who've never seen it. For a 60's sitcom surrounded by ""normal"" TV fare, years before the likes of Monty Python or SNL, Green Acres broke all the rules.
About this DVD set (IMHO):
First what I didn't like about it:
* - No extras! Nothing. Come on, Eddie Albert's still alive, at least they could have snuck in an interview, if not a commentary. (on the Dick Van Dyke DVD set they include interviews taken from the TV Land Dick Van Dyke Special.)
* - Only two disks, so you have to flip the disk over to watch the other 8 episodes. Also MGM (the company putting out the set) has a nasty habit of printing no graphics or info on the disks, just extremely tiny type around the disk hole.
Very cheap!
* - There were only about 4-5 different pieces of art they used for the box, inside graphics, inside booklet and interactive menu. This looks cheap too.
What I liked about it:
* - The quality of the episode pictures look surprisingly good. While there are some graininess in the opening credits after years of seeing lousy quality on reruns it's nice to see clear pictures on the DVD.
* - The interactive menu is easy to get through and there's a nice little booklet included.
* - After watching these episodes after all these years, and in the order they were released, I'm surprised how quickly the began to establish the bizarreness of Hootervile. While the pilot has Lisa as the sane one and Oliver as the nut, it only takes a few episodes to reverse that.
As for supporting characters, Arnold is in the pilot, but doesn't appear again until episode 8, and Lisa doesn't meet him until episode 12.
All-in all, it's a good package at a great price. Hopefully they'll eventually release the rest of the seasons.",1074384000,4,1753,4.447204968944099
1952914,4,B0000V4906,"This is a great price for 32 episodes of a classic tv show. I just hope they put extras on the other season sets if MGM releases them. But for now, just go buy it and maybey MGM will make the effort on season 2 and add some extras!",1074211200,4,231,3.7346938775510203
1952915,5,B0000V4906,"Even though there are absolutely no extras, I can strongly recommend this set.  As you all know, Green Acres was a hilarious show, so the only question is how well did MGM perform the transfer to DVD.  Well, it's pretty good, but not sensational.  But just having the entire first season available on DVD for around $20 is incredible.  If you like the show even a little, you will be happy you bought this.  Hopefully the remaining seasons, especially 2 and 3, will be forthcoming.",1074211200,7,481,4.6117647058823525
1952916,4,B0000V4906,"Despite a complete lack of editorial input (no featurettes, behind the scenes pieces, trivia, etc.) this collection of the first season of a truly eccentric '60s TV sitcom is a long-overdue gem.
Some of the more astute reviewers have mentioned the show's meta-satirical tendencies, its surreal sight gags, oddball characters, and such. Always a big fan of the GA thing, it was great to refresh myself with the sly absurdity that governs the universe of this show.
One GREEN ACRES 'tic' that I truly love is the repetition of a certain phrase, such as in the second episode, in which one character is taking bets for a pool to guess how many days Oliver and Lisa will stay in Hooterville. One character scoffs at the ""fool pool,"" and soon everyone is referring to the pool as ""the fool pool."" Such wordplay accelerates the tempo of the show, and I admire the blend of visual and verbal nonsense at the heart of GREEN ACRES.
Having watched just the first 2 episodes, I anticipate the many hours of mind-mangling pleasure ahead for me with this set. I really do wish they'd done at least a short documentary on the creators of the series. I'd love to know how Jay Sommers and Dick Chevillat, the best writing team on the show, came up with the dynamic absurdity in their characterizations and dialogue. With at least some of the show's stars still alive and well, it would have been easy to interview them about their memories of being a citizen of the hayseed Hellzapoppin' that was Hooterville. Perhaps future sets will have some extras.
I really don't mean to carp. Getting 13+ hours of this insanity for such a low price is a real treat. I hope they'll do the entire run of the show. It got weirder and weirder in passing seasons. Does anyone remember the episode about the beeping rock from outer space that makes Oliver's life hellish? Or the show in which Oliver keeps seeing an irate shotgun-wielding hillbilly, played by Percy Helton, who may or may not be real? Or Lisa's duck?
