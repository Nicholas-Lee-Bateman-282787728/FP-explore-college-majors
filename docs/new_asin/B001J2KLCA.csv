8535159,5,B001J2KLCA,"This is a great collection of the first 10 years at Jacobs Field, one of America's best ballparks.  I highly recommend ""1995: Cleveland Rocks"", relive the magic of one of the greatest teams in MLB history!  Also, check out the bonus DVD featuring Tom Hamilton: voice of the Indians!!  Book is a great read, and this boxset is a MUST for classic baseball fans!",1376352000,,359,4.578125
