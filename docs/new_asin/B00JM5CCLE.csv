Every week you see these jaw dropping aquariums going from concept to completion.  And learn something new about tropical/aquarium fish.  So glad it's finally being released on DVD!",1451952000,,314,5.22
8652354,4,B00JM5CCLE,"Only six episodes in this season and if you by chance saw season 2 specials every tank in season one was basically recovered.  I really like TANKED and I hope it has a long run.  Wish they would cover how they made the tanks pictured in their ads for season 1 and 2. Specially, the large 2 year build of the tank for the mega church in Dallas the the large tank with  octopus holding it up.",1449273600,2,390,4.038961038961039
