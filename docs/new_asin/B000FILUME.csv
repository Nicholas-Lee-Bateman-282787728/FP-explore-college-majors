8123437,3,B000FILUME,Bought it because Cerina Vincent was listed in the cast.  She didn't have much of a part though.,1420761600,,96,4.333333333333333
8123438,4,B000FILUME,"Its very a very entertaining movie. This is a great movie if you like Egyptian type movies. I've been fascinated with movies like this when Boris Karloff first came to the screen. Great Saturday afternoon ""Popcorn"" eating movie.",1410566400,,228,5.026315789473684
8123439,1,B000FILUME,This movie was totally ridiculous and a waste of film. It started out stupid and remained stupid throughout the entire film. DO NOT EVER RENT OR BUY THIS FILM!!,1388966400,,160,4.551724137931035
8123440,3,B000FILUME,"I didn't give it five stars because it wasn't great, simple. But, it was very entertaining. I only recognized one actor, but that doesn't mean much.  It did have good acting and the action was pretty good.  Not Iron Man but still, all in all, a good movie. Worth the bucks.",1325289600,,273,4.333333333333333
8123441,4,B000FILUME,"I recently bought and watched this movie because it was made in Mescal Arizona, a place i visit every year on my vacations from Florida to arizona. It wasn't a bad movie, I enjoyed it, kinda like those spaghetti westerns of the old days, but since I love all the old westerns I liked this one too. There are not many westerns made anymore, so you have to appreciate any that come along.",1220745600,4,386,4.301369863013699
8123442,1,B000FILUME,"I have seen some good B films and some average, others not so good but this one is in a class on its own. So bad that it has no redeaming quality. Plot? what plot! As for the 7 mummies i counted only two. I think thats right, 2 but iam not sure (becouse by that stage my mind started to wonder, what i had planed for the next day.) The Kung Fu fight scenes with the Mummie/mummies were embarasing to say the least. The Rap music played while convicts walked through the desert and the metal music played during the action(?)scenes was the most horrorfying thing about this turkey. As for the guy who was paid to do not much but laugh, one would have to conclude that he knew that the joke was on the audiance. All in all this film is a mess.
Dont take my word for it. watch it for yourself, but you have been warned.",1197590400,2,816,4.074534161490683
8123443,4,B000FILUME,"7 Mummies is a mix of Con Air, Mummy, and Night of the Living Dead. The plot, without giving too much away, involves a group of prisoners being transported across the desert. The convicts escape, taking a guard hostage, and set out across the treacherous desert trying to get to Mexico. Along the way, the come across a set of clue and a crazy old man- both of which point to a ghost town and more gold than can be spent in several lifetimes. The only caveat is between the ninja mummies, the vampire hookers, and crazy cowboys, there is no guess on just how long they'll be able to live...

This movie really is just a fun, brainless bit of thrill. It could have easily received 5 stars (especially for being a direct to DVD production), but the first 20 minutes of the movie is painfully slow, and the last two minutes feel tacked on. The movie could have benefited from additional editing. I know it is already a short movie- less than 80 minutes, but I would rather have watched a 60 minute version cut a little cleaner--- think Masters of Horror.

Aside from needing a bit more editing, this movie is just a great horror movie, the kind you watch when you want to smile and not think for a while-- definitely not the kind you watch when you really want to be scared.

Recommended for all of those into B horror, and zombie fun.",1170633600,5,1332,4.362903225806452
8123444,1,B000FILUME,"There are not seven mummies in this movie.

There is not one moment of cohesive script.

The acting is some of the worst I've seen.  Shame on Billy Drago and Danny Trejo for getting paid to laugh maniacally.

The editing and camerawork are pitiful.

There is no horror or suspense.

There is NOTHING to recommend about this movie.

AVOID AVOID AVOID.",1156377600,7,350,4.639344262295082
8123445,3,B000FILUME,"Thanks to the cast of intersting characters, decent make-up effects, and the story fast pace, the film ends  up as a pretty entertaing watch. The movie follows a group of inmates who recently escape transport and now are now on the run towards Mexico. That is until they meet up with an old Apache, who recites a tale of lost gold, where the prisoners natural greed get the best of them and decide to skip out on crossing the border and take up on the promise of wealth and happiness. while seeking out treasure, the inmates come across an old western town where everyone's seemingly dressed as if they're still living in the old west. The group stops at the tavern where they take in a couple whores and drink up some brews before continuing their path for the gold. Much like From Dusk Till Dawn, the towns people in the tavern are revealed to be vampires and ghouls, ready to suck and devour their lives. Could this undead town be the key to the hidden treasure? It seemed like this movie suffered from an identity crises, not knowing whether it  was a vampire, zombie, or mummy movie. Regaurdless, it was still a fun watch,mostly due to the cast and decent production values. This is Nick Quested film debut, after working with music videos, which would explain the pointless montages of our actors walking in semi-slow motion with annoying rap music playing in an attempt to expand its 76 minute running time. Filled cliches and predictability, the pencil thin plot is easily forgotten when our leads are mowing down ghouls and vamps with a double-barrow shotgun. Aside from the cast, the only thing the movie had going for it was the decent action, especially when it was time to reveal the mummies which turned out to be karate-choppin robe-wearing priests. Yes, the mummies in this film are not your typical bandaged, slow walking mummies, but instead, ass-kicking martial artists, which force our actors to use more than their guns when it came down to fighting. As dumb as that sounds, it did bump the film's entertainment factor up another notch. The film from other movies, and does not make a whole lot of sense, but when it came down to pacing and entertainment, it was a fun ride. Overall the story is dumb and does not make a lot of sense, but thanks to the cast of familiar faces and intresting characters, with some decent gore, action and make-up effects, the movie ends up being a fairly entertaining horror fair.",1146528000,13,2433,4.655813953488372
