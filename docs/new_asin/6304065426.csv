I first saw Golden Boy  when it was just released and as I was then a crazy teen, it completely made me laugh .

The story starts with Kintaro Oe, heading for a new job on his bicycle , while listening to his headphones, he got ran over by a car because he was biking while wearing his headphones and couldn't hear the car horn . It turned out that a woman has ran him over and to make matters worse she turns out to be Kintaro's boss .The woman ( Madam President )owns a software company and of course Kintaro knowing nothing of the sort ended up cleaning toilets since he only knows basic MS-Dos ...and no knowledge of Computer Programs .

Kintaro is the kind of guy that thinks life is a study and to prove it, he even left law school to pursue whatever job that comes along and all in the name of studying .( at least that's that he calls it )",1094428800,,958,4.052910052910053
7860268,5,6304065426,"This is a great title if you are looking for something a little more  sexual, but not hentai.  While there is no sex, and very little nudity, the  series is very raunchy.  Plus, the main Golden Girl in this episode has the  biggest nipples I have ever seen.  Now the show is sexually funny but is in  no means erotic.  All sex is played strictly for laughs.  There is also  alot of other gross stuff (you have to see the toilet scene), but the  series is generally pretty sweet.  Kentaro is a nice guy who is just trying  to learn about life.  Half them time when he messes up he thinks he is  trying to do the right thing.  I think anyone who likes shows like Sakura  Diaries (which is a bit more seriouse) would love this movie.  I know I do.",969235200,,744,4.119718309859155
