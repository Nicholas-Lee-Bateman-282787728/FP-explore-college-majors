8309131,4,B00008979W,"The DVD is marred by the interview section which is not volumed at the same level as the rest of the DVD (and by the fact that the interviews are quite dated).  But, on the whole, it is a must own DVD if you like music that is different.
I hope that the stuff they did not do on the warner label gets released.
The shorts are actually quite incredible even with the knowledge that most of CT has a background in design (academically).",1057795200,,434,4.166666666666667
8309132,4,B00008979W,"This dvd spans the carrear of Cafe Tacuba with their first label and its probably the best buy in any collection. If you want to listent to music that transcends all barriers this is it. It has 17 videos beginning with the ones made from their last album and ending with the ones from their first. It also includes two shorts made by cozme,nru,juan,or rita cantalagua , the lead singer, that are pretty experimental works on the themes they usually deal with, self exploration, rebirth, and funkiness. Their music is truly inspiring and energitic. They emphesize the contrast of living in one of the largest cities in the world, and at the same time living in a country that is 90% rural. They use this point of view to explore what mexico means to them, the world,  and the universe. They embrace all muscial styles and all their videos are visually entartaining and are full of energy and color. The interview sections are dated, but to this day they stand true to concept of Cafe Tacuba and to their own individual musical identeties. The only disavantage is that the interview sections are not subtititled. These are very crucial to understanding of the group and their musical philosophy. This is the dvd to own if you want to bring life to your collection.",1048896000,9,1262,4.684684684684685
