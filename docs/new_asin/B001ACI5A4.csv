8604387,5,B001ACI5A4,"Love the videos. I bought the four Spanish videos Conoce los Numeros, Conoce las Letras, Conoce las Figuras y Conoce los Colores, when my oldest son was 18 months and a few weeks after he started pointing at colors, shapes, number and letters. And the best part is that you can play the videos both in Spanish and English.

The content seems boring to an adult because of its repetitiveness but my son really enjoys them.",1332288000,3,421,4.5394736842105265
