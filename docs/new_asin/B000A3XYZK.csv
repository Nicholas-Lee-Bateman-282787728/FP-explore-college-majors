8074181,3,B000A3XYZK,"Attila is not the most sophisticated Verdi opera, and certainly isn't an accurate portrayal of history, but the music is fun and contains some impressive show-stoppers for talented singers. Unfortunately, none of the soloists carry off their parts without problems, though none are downright terrible.

Nesterenko is probably the most consistent of the four main singers, and although his dramatic commitment is less than ideal, he can sing all of his notes with no major problems. He does tend to a distinct wobble in the upper part of his range, but it is not unduly obtrusive, though it does make him sound rather old. His tone is good, though perhaps not as dark as this role ideally calls for.

Maria Chiara was the reason I acquired this DVD. She was under-recorded and underrated in her prime. Unfortunately this performance captures her past her best, and I don't know that her voice was ever ideally suited to Odabellabut, to be fair, it would be hard to find a soprano that can successfully carry off her two drastically different big arias. In her opening aria, which can be the most impressive of the opera if done right, Chiara doesnt sound warmed up, falls behind the orchestra more than once and fails to perfectly negotiate the brutal ascending runs. That said, shes in character and sounds properly fierce when she sings. Her second aria (Oh! Nel fuggente nuvolo) starts off rocky as she slides around her opening notes, but she quickly settles and carries off a really beautiful coloratura toward the end. Her acting in this performance is better than anyone elses, and you really feel her pathos throughout. She ends the opera strongly, too.

Carroli has the potential to play his part well, and he has a pleasing tone. Unfortunately he strains for his high notes and sounds labored throughout his first duet with Nesterenko. I want to like him, but he tends toward unsteadiness too often to be fully satisfactory. That said, he carries off Dagl'immortali vertici fairly well.

Im not familiar with the tenor, Veriano Luchetti, but it seems he was recorded frequently in the 1970s and here I suspect his fame oversold him. He struggles at first but warms up eventually. When I first heard his opening aria Ella in poter del barbaro and subsequent cabaletta, I wasn't sure sure why he was castthe tessitura was plainly too high for him, and his tone was unpleasantly nasal throughout. He also scooped and slid around worse than most sopranos. His top, besides tending toward flatness, can carry a prominent bleat, and the final high note of his cabaletta sounds strained, desperate, and horribly strangled. He does improve further on in the production when he is not required to go so high, and carries off his duets with Chiara in Act II quite well. Another redeeming virtue, I suppose, is he seems to have quite of bit of the volume and power necessary for singing over the orchestra in the Arenaperhaps that is why he was cast instead of somebody who can adequately sing the high notes of his big aria. His last solo number, Che non avrebbe il misero goes much better, though the nasal tone can be grating on the ears.

Despite these vocal flaws, this production has several merits. The soloists are adequate and even excellent in places once they get warmed up. The costumes and staging are all excellent, and Santis conducting is terrific. The chorus and orchestra really ground this production, and for these reasons alone the DVD is worth viewing if you can acquire it cheaply or borrow it. I cant compare it to other available DVDs of Attila since I haven't seen them, but it may be a good introduction to the opera for those who prefer a visual approach. However, I have heard a number of superior audio renditions of this opera, and would suggest the Muti with Ramey and Studer, or if you can find it, Mutis 1972 recording with Ghiaurov and Gencer. I'm really inclined to give this production three and a half stars if possible because the whole package really is not bad, but since voices are particularly important to me, I lean toward the three rather than the four.",1423180800,2,4097,4.764788732394366
8074182,3,B000A3XYZK,"Attila is not everybody's cup of tea. I happen to love it. However, not necessarily this production. Although Nesterenko is a very convincing Hun with a great voice to match, the production is dark and uninteresting. I have heard Maria Chiara to better effect elsewhere. Here she tends to be shrill when she gets to her top notes. Yet it is probably more down to earth, so to speak, than the one I prefer despite its high cant, namely Riccardo Muti's with Sam Ramey, Carol Studer and Giorgio Zancanaro. Not only is the singing great but the opera comes actually alive.",1349481600,,568,4.633663366336633
8074183,4,B000A3XYZK,"This is a classic ""stand and sing"" Italian pot-boiler and I love it. The singers are Italian (except Attila), the setting is Italian, the performance is Italian (Arena di Verona), the audience is Italian (and quite vocal) and the conductor is 100% Italian and a great one at that, Nello Santi. From the moment the lights go on to start the prologue (no curtain, it's an huge arena) the um pah-pah begins as Foresto (Luchetti) a defeated knight faces the audience and belts out his sorrow over the loss of his native Italian land and his Italian woman Odabella to the nasty foreigner Attila. It's patriotism, it's Risorgimento (fight for Italy's freedom), it's a call for victory over the repressors ....and it's fun. The Ezio (a Roman general) of Silvano Carroli is a showpiece for the Verdi baritone, the heroine Odabella and her fiendishly difficult tessitura are stunningly done by Maria Chiara and it's a great romp for everyone else. Alas the Attila is a disappointment. The Russian Evgeny Nesterenko has a fine bass voice but he is no match for the memory of Samual Ramey. Ramey owned the part for many years and was a veritable fireball on stage. Nesterenko sounds nice but is not exciting. More's the pity for everything else is exciting and having a good time. I still recommend this as the true Italian spirit is there and you can smell the garlic and tomato sauce.",1263859200,9,1375,4.733333333333333
