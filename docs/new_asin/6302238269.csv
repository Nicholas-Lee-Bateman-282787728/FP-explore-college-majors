440040,5,6302238269,"The first time I saw this movie I was in my 30's, and like the 2 other reviews, it ripped me wide open.  When I saw it a second time, I figured since I knew how it went it wouldn't have the same effect on me.  WRONG!  Just as powerful the second time.  I thought it was because there were similarities to my own life -- a young family torn apart and then reuniting.  It's up there with Steel Magnolia's for a guaranteed gut level release.  I believe true stories are the best stories.",1019174400,4,484,4.095744680851064

I saw it once and out of all the movies I've seen in my life time, (probably close to a million since I'm a movie buff)this is one of the few movies that I will always remember. I didn't know it was a true story which makes it even more profound. I would love to see the movie again I'm sure it will be just as good as the first time if not better.

I had seen it as a child when it first aired on tv. Tried to find it on VHS many years later, and finally found it from eBay but the tape was distorted over time.

THIS MAN LOST HIS CHILDREN TO THE SYSTEM IN 1930'S AMERICA.  HIS WIFE BECAME VERY ILL AND WOULD NOT SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  SHE DIED AND THE FATHER WAS BLAMED FOR NOT GETTING HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  HE WAS TRYING TO RESPECT HIS WIFE'S WISHES EVEN THOUGH HE WANTED TO TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  BECAUSE OF THIS, HIS BOYS WERE TAKEN FROM HIM BY DECEITFUL MEANS BY THE SYSTEM.  HE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO GET HIS CHILDREN BACK AND HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO GET THEM BACK.  THIS IS A VERY SAD, HEART-RENDING MOVIE.  IT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOU SEAT.  YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ROOT FOR THIS FATHER EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

440201,5,6302238269,"Grab a box of Kleenex, you'll need one; I did!

I've been waiting for years to be able to purchase a DVD of this movie that I first saw on TV, back in 1987. This is a must see movie based on actual events during the Depression. This makes one aware of what can happen when we don't step in to give our neighbors a helping hand when needed, even today.

Elmer (father) finds himself in a dilemma after his wife passes away. He is forced to seek help from the welfare department, only to find out that the children are taken from him because of trumped-up charges of being an unfit parent. The abuse the children are subjected to in foster homes and institutions will bring you to tears. With the conditions imposed by the court, Elmer is in a fight of his life to have his children returned to him.

Catherine June Armstrong Inscore, the granddaughter of the father depicted in this movie: Because of their treatment, none of the boys ever had a good life; none could ever be a loving father; they never recovered from their tragic circumstances.  This devastation damaged lives for several generations.

I too thought that there was more to the 1987 movie than what was on this DVD.",1324339200,2,1182,4.453703703703703

The DVD was missing a few parts to the story that I remember seeing as a kid and had a few extra parts that maybe I missed before or just did not remember.  The quality of the picture was not wonderful, but was worth the price.

440206,5,6302238269,"I'd seen this movie years ago but couldn't remember the title. My wife did some internet searching and found out the name for me. Then I began searching various sites to find the best price on a DVD made for viewing in the U.S. (I found several that stated they were not encoded for this country).
My wife had never seen the movie and we watched about a week after I purchased it. I think we were both a little teary eyed afterwards.
I think Mark Harmon is great in everything I've seen him in & this is no exception. But the storyline and the intrusiveness of Government really shows how powerless one person can be at times,(I'll stop there, I don't want to ruin it for anyone else).
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a ""real life/heartache"" type movie. Excellent",1304985600,2,781,4.430555555555555

It was excruciating to watch, while at the same time I couldn't stop - I had to know the outcome for this father and his children.  So much suffering and courage and raw human emotion is portrayed -- it moved me so deeply that I cried harder than any movie I've ever seen.  Mark Harmon is absolutely brilliant.  You feel his pain to the very depths of your soul. Seeing what the children endured is heartbreaking. If you are parent you will cry through to the end.  I've not seen the movie aired since I last saw it and can't understand why it is so elusive.  It is a phenomenal story that shows the most wonderful love of a father to his children.

The viewer is taken back to 1920s America and the bakward attitudes of the establishment who do not stop to consider each case before them.

Based on a true story you are taken on the journey of a loving father and his four sons through the worst nightmare that could be imposed on them.

Mark Harmon (who plays the father) goes to extreme lengths to get his boys back when an obvious ""screwed-up"" child services system had them taken away after the death of their mom.  What the boys endure after being placed in the ""system"" is nothing short of cruelty.  One word of caution - make sure you have plenty of tissues handy.

Finally got it on VHS so I could watch the entire movie and I was shocked!  I cried buckets!!!  I was mad, too... and sad :0(  The things society and the courts can do to people is appalling and shocking to me.

I say for those of us whom have the chance to get it do so as it may become one of the rarest movies to ever be found in the future. I know there are some controversial subjects within the movie that may have made it an ""undesirable"" movie to market,.....such as sterilization (castration) at asylums for young orphan boys.

Not only did he just lose his wife, but the system rips away his kids and totally destroys them from the inside out.

In the research I have done about this story, I would like to put in one place some of the facts that I've gathered.

What they did to him to keep him from his children ...So sweet",1509840000,,172,4.088235294117647
7822722,5,6302238269,"I had been looking for this movie for a long time. It is a very touching and 'real' story that I believe could have really happened in the depression... and depicting the angrier, more abusive characters to real life people was well done.",1498262400,,238,4.558139534883721

7822724,5,6302238269,"Living in NYC most of my life and reading about the horrors of foster care for children now did NOT prepare me for the horrors that were prevalent during the time of the depression.
Mark Harmon delivers a heart wrenching performance as the father who just wanted a little financial help after his wife died and the corrupt system literally stole his four boys from him.
It was almost like watching Mengele and his experiment's on children during the Holocaust with the eldest boy. Two of the boys were abused physically and mentally in a home for retarded children.
This was based on a real life story.
spoiler: Mark Harmon finds love with a young and caring woman and they have a daughter.
She encourages his carpenter skills and he builds a large home and has a good job and now a wife-he has met the so-called requirements to try and get his boys back.
They are damaged mentally and physically.
One decent caring psychiatrist  bucked the corruption in the child welfare system and the eldest son is returned.
stop reading if you don't want spoilers-
This young man had his legs broken and was sterilized and worse and despite all that he loved his father and seemed to be the most mentally stable of the boys.
This is NOT a movie for children in any way.
Everyone warned to get out the Kleenex and that is a given. By the end my husband and I were wrung out-BUT-we will watch it again eventually.
If I learned anything it is to make sure our foster care system gets rid of the bureaucratic red tape and bad social workers who don't remove innocent children from home only interested in a pay check.
Find out what's happening in your city and state and try and make a difference.
A movie that will stay with you and haunt you.
Kudos to the young actors portraying the boys early on and later. They are the real stars of this movie.",1491091200,2,1833,4.455357142857143
7822725,5,6302238269,"Has the quality of a made for TV movie, but the subject matter is very moving, documenting a dark corner of our history in the 1930s. The breakdown of the family and close-knit communities where people help each other on a local level leads the government to step in to fix things. But the results are often tragic, as this movie documents. Government employees emboldened by their power to control others' lives wreck havoc wherever they work their evil. Professing to want only what is best for the children, they ruin families and abuse the vulnerable.",1484438400,,555,4.791666666666667
