195179,3,1574922777,"This should have been a wonderful movie--Angela Lansbury and most of the rest of the cast are terrific. But someone decided that the book was too sad as originally written. I don't want to give away the book's story for those who haven't read it yet, but two major deaths have been written out and family reconciliations abound. The novel was much tougher--and truer--as written by Ms. Pilcher. Totally unnecessary.",983232000,35,415,4.942857142857143
195180,5,1574922777,"Shellseekers is the most wonderful movie I have ever seen.  Rosamund  Pilcher is able to put together personal struggles, family situations, and  a love interest, all coming together to make you look at your life, see  yourself and your children, and go forward.

195223,4,1574922777,"The Shell Seekers is on of my favorite books from all time. I read it again from time to time. It's such a great story and finally I got to see it in a movie.

It's very nice to put faces on the names you read and Angela Lansbury fits Penelope Keeling perfectly. Although, the movie it's not a 100% trustful to the book. There are a few scenes that doesn't happen in the book at all, like, Penelope dies in the book, but in the movie it ends with her very much alive. Besides that, the movie is somewhat true to the story with the details and facts. Another example is how Penelope's daughter, Nancy, is pictured whit a chubby figure, but in the movie, slender. But, the character of George, Nancy's husband, couldn't' be more genuine, or Danus, the gardener.

I wish it had more details in it, but, I imagine how hard is to compress 600+ pages of a story into a 2 hour footage. So, if you read the book, I strongly recommend you to watch this.",1398297600,3,944,4.209944751381215

195231,3,1574922777,"This 1989 adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's The Shell Seekers runs at around 102 minutes. The 2006 production on the other hand, Shell Seekers (Widescreen), runs at 3 hours, and is not only well-cast in general, but also more faithful to the novel. The saving grace of this 1989 production is Angela Lansbury's performance as Penelope Keeling, a woman who despite having missed some opportunities in life, having suffered the loss of her greatest love, and having the ignominy of being surrounded by a pathetic lot of individuals, two of whom are her own children, continues to maintain a positive outlook on life, and tries to make the best out of problematic situations. In the end, she finds the peace she is looking for, and is content.

The short length of time for this production doesn't allow it to do justice to the novel. Too many scenes in the book have been cut out and some are meshed together, and the result is a rather choppy production. There are some positives though, which is why I gave it three stars. Angela Lansbury, one of my favorite actresses, delivers a compelling and heartfelt performance, though the constraints of the script doesn't allow her to express the full range of Penelope Keeling's character. The cinematography is beautiful: Penelope's beautiful home, the scenes at Cornwall, etc. The secondary characters, especially those who play her children, could have been better cast, but they do an OK job overall. I did take issue with some of the blatant errors in translating the novel onto the screen. In this adaptation, Penelope's mother-in-law, an odious woman, is still alive, and is portrayed as being an overbearing woman, constantly criticizing Penelope. In the novel, the MIL is dead when Penelope is shown in her older years. The 2006 adaptation achieves this nicely by using the flashback technique effectively to indicate the state of relations between Penelope and her MIL.

The 2006 production, due to its longer running time, is able to develop the characters with greater depth, and the scenes of Penelope's past, back during the war, provide enough filler information as to Penelope's life then so as to help the viewer understand her better in the present. This is sadly missing from the 1989 production, and the flashback scenes are altogether too brief.

On the whole, I think this is worth a watch for Lansbury's performance and the cinematography, but I would certainly recommend the 2006 adaptation, and of course, the source work.",1390348800,5,2490,4.995180722891567

This delightful story takes place in the suburbs of England, with many scenic views of the ocean and countryside. After spending some time in a hospital, and then recuperating at the home of her daughter, Angela feels the need to ""move on"" and return to her own home.  She also has the desire to ""go back"" to something she feels she has lost over the years, but is not exactly sure what that is.  However, her children think that she should sell her things (primarily art work of her father's), spread the wealth around, and live with her children for the remainder of her life.  The people who come into her life, and the way in which she deals with them, as well as her children, and finally finding what she thought ""she had lost"" is sheer joy as you reach the conclusion of this heart-touching story.",1310688000,3,969,4.426966292134831

  Later I found the original that I wanted somewhere else, and I now have both copies and both of them are great!!! Thank you Amazon so much, for letting me enjoy Angela Lansbury in a most favorite movie I originally saw with Vanessa Redgrave.
  It is nice to see both Actress's in the same role, but a bit different script. If you had had the one I first wanted, I'd never have seen Angela Lansbury. So, thanks to Amazon.com, not having the specific one I wanted I now have both and can't thank them enough.

195255,1,1574922777,"While I realize that this is a nice movie albeit it only 98 minutes, it is NOT the Shell Seekers. Anyone who loves this story-I have just reread it for the 7th time, will be very dissappointed. The story is totally butchered and even if Ms Pilcher approved the edits I don't care, it took out the depth and the incredible humanity of the original. The original is not sad, it is a tremendously uplifting and moving story. In addition to the dismantling of the story I believe the casting is particularly poor, not my image of the wonderfully dynamic characters in the book at all. While I love Angela Lansbury she has had to portray a Penelope that is a confused and melancholy old lady-not the vivacious and independent Penelope of the book -The most outrageous affront is the treatment of the role of Richard-that was the heart of the orginal and here its almost non existent. IF you are thinking of buying this to supplement your love for the book don't bother. Stick to your own images of the story -your own movie rather than ruining them with this melancholoy sudsy family soap opera of an older mother trying to cope with her 3 selfish adult children and having it all turn out sweet and fine in the end. Rubbish.",1220572800,6,1220,4.5
195256,3,1574922777,"Angela Lansbury is one of my favorite actresses and she is excellent in this touching story which brought tears to my eyes more than once. The other actors, primarily British, are also very good and the English scenery is lovely. It's rather nice to see a movie where the main character is female, 63, and still searching for answers instead of being wise and all knowing. However, I did find the story rather disjointed at times and felt like a lot was missing. My next step is to listen to the audiobook which is sure to fill in some missing information.",1197072000,,556,4.514851485148514

The most notorious of these, caiman, even refuses to give a refund or an exchange for YOUR mistake in having ordered a PAL version.

The movie itself is easily five stars: * * * * *

The documentary with this movie has the producer and the screenwriter saying that Rosamunde herself approved the changes that they made in the script in bringing this novel to the screen.  So, those who think they are being sophisticated by whining about the fact that the movie is different from the book are merely showing how sophomoric they are.

This is a superb movie of realistic and appealing characters, realistic and heart-rending relationships and real-life situations.  That it manages to be gripping and involving in addition to all that realism is a testament to the skill of the moviemakers.

195261,5,1574922777,"A beautiful, warm, and compelling film, THE SHELL SEEKERS is one of television's few genuine film masterpieces. Originally produced as a Hallmark Hall of Fame  presentation, this absorbing and all too human drama deserves much more widespread  attention.

Though it may not follow the book in every respect, it nonetheless stands on it's own.  (And --please!--readers

of the book should ALLOW it to stand on it's own, as any film is meant to do,  judging it on IT'S OWN merits and not against their memory of the book!)

Well written and beautifully filmed, it features outstanding  performances by a well rounded cast of uniformly excellent actors, not the least of whom is star Angela Lansbury.

In a day in which grown children find it all too easy to  blame their parents for every childhood shortcoming, the warmth, compassion, and uplifting  message of this filmic gem can help bring healing and insight to many of today's

searching ""thirtysomethings"".  This isn't just a movie, it's a healing and enlightening experience.  It can also

bring encouragement and support to today's ""sixty-somethings"" who have felt the brunt of false guilt and

undeserved criticism from ungrateful offspring.

Unavailable on television or video for many years, truly this is a film not to be missed. It's a beautiful, poignant video that belongs in every family's video library.",1114387200,15,1368,5.117647058823529

The important thing is that the movie be able to stand on it's own, so that even with the changes you embrace it.  Not this movie.  I actually couldn't wait for it to end - the acting was bad, the casting was even worse.... I think that sums it all up.",1102723200,6,358,4.159420289855072
195263,1,1574922777,"I saw about 20 minutes of the Hallmark TV version and went shrieking from the room!  And this is possibly my favorite novel of all time.  Angela Lansbury is terribly miscast.  Penelope with stiffly coiffed hair, a corsage and a pink afternoon dress?!?  What happened to the boat cloak?  It should have been Judy Dench!  This is nearly as bad as the carnage wreaked on ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" by casting Darryl Hannah.  Trying to stuff a big novel into 98 minutes is a travesty.  I see why writers like Steven King and J.K. Rowling take such tough control of their works when someone wants to film them.  Couldn't we wait a few years and try again, this time in a 13 week series or something like ""Ballykissangel""?",1097193600,11,713,4.465116279069767
195264,1,1574922777,"No realistic viewer expects a filmed version of a book to be identical. But it SHOULD be true to the spirit of the novel (or why bother filming it?), and this TV movie is definitely not. Most of the main characters are too different, especially Penelope Keeling (Angela Lansbury is quite the wrong actress) - the Penelope in this film is unrecognisable. But the worst betrayal is the portrayal of Penelope's love affair with Richard, especially the change to its ending and to the ending of the book. If you want to watch a banal movie, and have neither read the book nor wish to read one of the finest novels in English, buy the movie. Much better, buy, read and re-read the book, and give yourself a real treat.",1096156800,34,713,4.492307692307692

Now we're all waiting for her to die. 98 long minutes. She doesn't die. My grandma says she was dead at the end, but I say no..that was me. I was bored to death.

The general plot is Mrs. Potts has 3 non-teapot kids and I can't tell them apart. It seems that Nancy and her brother are married. But they aren't. Nancy is really married to some of grouch. He should die too. But I don't think he does.

It was fun and interesting to compare my own personal images of Penelope, Nancy, Olivia, Noel, Antonia, and Danus to those in the movie.  Sure, there were a lot of differences, but if you LOVE Rosamunde Pilcher's novels as much as I do then you can appreciate this movie and how it tried to grasp the feeling of the story, if not the exact plot.  I highly recommend the book Coming Home if you enjoyed The Shell Seekers, and the movie Coming Home is excellent, too!",1084924800,3,601,4.330357142857143
195267,2,1574922777,"I loved Rosamunde Pilcher's novel The Shell Seekers so much that I just had to buy this video simply to become immersed once more in the world of cosy detail Rosamunde provides us.  I thought it couldn't possibly be that bad.  Well, frankly, it is rather bad.  Even though it was filmed in Great Britain, it lacked that British feeling that I was going after.  I felt as though I had tuned into a very early ""Murder She Wrote"" episode with Angela Lansbury surrounded by two-bit actors.  Danus was particularly dreadful - no character development - there is absolutely no appeal and you actually hope Antonia does not fall in love with him.  The actor who portrays Noel has an easy time of it being weak and greedy, and as for Nancy, why is she so thin?  Olivia and Cosmo were the only ones who seemed true to the book.  As for reviving Richard - I can only agree with the other reviewer - Penelope would never have chosen to be without him.  How trite they made that love affair!
In sum, the movie was far too short to offer any kind of in-depth development.  The critical war years were glossed over in mediocre flashbacks.  But I suppose it would be alright if you're home for the day with a ghastly cold and you can't actually read the novel again.  Just make sure you lace your tea with something a bit stronger - it might make viewing more tolerable.",1065484800,8,1355,4.397590361445783
195268,2,1574922777,"This is one of my favorite books and after re-reading it for the umpteenth time I decided to purchase the Hallmark Hall of Fame version. The first part is very good for a TV movie - beautiful locations, fine acting (how can one fault Angela Lansbury?), and relatively faithful to the story (one must take into consideration that time is of the essence on TV and often plots become condensed). However, to TOTALLY change the ending (a medical mis-diagnosis unexplained and bringing characters back from the dead to name only two!) was unconscionable. The power of the story was lost and it turned into just another tear-jerker. It would be as if Scarlett and Rhett rode off into the sunset together and lived happily ever after! BUT, if you've never read the book it would be an enjoyable couple of hours entertainment. I will never watch The Shell Seekers again, and am putting mine up for sale (cheap!).",1039219200,20,904,4.727848101265823

The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters.  Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing.  The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end.  Don't buy it.  In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead.",1038441600,10,537,4.621052631578947
