5070741,5,B0079ZWUW0,"So many deservedly dark films abound about Capitalism:  bank and credit failures, market crashes, layoffs, corporate thieves, bailouts of billionaires while their workers languish......

This film is different.  With humor, wisdom, and surprising candor, the now old men who built the Silicon Valley and the biotech industry reflect on how they did it and why.  The history of Apple Computers is a lesson in how business acumen can combine with raw talent and narcissism, and how, when the 'chips' are down, bet on the business men.....and Tom Perkins' reflections on making money while changing the world for the better is a touching, funny, wise tribute to an economic system that can transform lives for the better.......we have a lot of reminders about Capitalism's dark side.  Something Ventured is just great fun, and a deservedly admiring view of  those who gave computers and new medicines to the world, while enriching themselves.",1353801600,7,939,5.226666666666667
5070742,5,B0079ZWUW0,"How do you secure financing when you have no collateral or assets to insure against, but an idea or a business plan that could see high returns, or even change the world? You need someone willing to take the risk, and bet on the people and on the market that does not yet exist. All things considered, that's a poor business plan by most measures - welcome to the world of ""venture capital"".

""Something Ventured"" is a fascinating documentary about the beginnings of the venture capital industry in the 1960's, and it's rise as one of the primary sources of startup capital. All of the early movers and shakers (Arthur Rock, Tom Perkins, Eugene Kliener, and many others), are still around, and willing to share their stories, lesssons, successes and failures. As a bonus, the documentary also covers the founding stories of Fairchild, Intel, Atari, Cisco, Genentech, Apple and a few others, through interviews with the founders and their funders.

Short, packed with great interviews and many great lessons, and definitely worth watching if you're an (aspiring) entrepreneur, or curious about the business of venture capital.",1347148800,5,1125,5.043010752688172
5070743,5,B0079ZWUW0,"""Something Ventured: Risk, Reward and the Original Venture Capitalists"" is packaged and marketed as though everyone suddenly is, indeed, focused on ""The Economy, Stupid"" as politicians keep claiming. And, perhaps millions are indeed interested in learning more about how capitalist systems work these days. But, as a journalist for more than 30 years, I know this truth: Ask your audience to tell you what they want to learn about and they will sound like high school students filling out their college-bound lesson plans. But, instead, actually watch them open their newspaper and we discover that what they really want is their favorite comic strip, maybe a new recipe, perhaps the employment listings and especially advertisements for their real interests, such as movies, new restaurants, the latest electronic gadgets or maybe a reliable used car.

So, I will say this about Something Ventured: You certainly will learn the 101 textbook lesson about America's first true ""venture capitalists"" in this movie. And,  yes, it is startling to learn that the red-hot vocation of the digital age is only a few decades old. The original ""venture capitalists"" are still around and are happy to reflect on what they got right--and what they got wrong.

Now, we're talking about the real reason to get this new Zeigeist release and watch it soon with your spouse, with friends, with your teen-aged and 20-something kids or with friends at work. I actually watched the film twice to make sure that I will recall just a few of the fascinating tips and techniques these super-smart and super-adaptive investors reveal about what makes them so successful.
Here are just a few lessons you'll learn (don't worry, there are so many tips in this film that this doesn't spoil the experience):

Tip 1: When you pick up a daily newspaper, read the obituaries first. You're likely to spend only a few minutes with the newspaper in our busy culture and you should start by reading about lives we have collectively identified as having wide appeal. Why do we want to remember these people who have died? In your own life, pay more attention to the values celebrated in the daily obituary columns.

Tip 2: Try lots of new ideas, because the vast majority will fail. As innovators at ReadTheSpirit online magazine and publishing house, we live by this rule. Month to month, you'll find fresh ideas brimming from our webpages. Year to year, we keep emphasizing the small handful that are successful--and quickly forget the duds. That's how all of these successful venture capitalists conduct their lives.

Tip 3: Even with that code of conduct, you're still going to make mistakes. You'll absolutely groan when you meet the investor who turned thumbs down to a desperate young Steve Jobs when Jobs was willing to hand this guy one third of Apple's shares for just $50,000. Believe me, the guy who rejected that deal is still beating his head against a wall. At the time, though, he just couldn't understand why anyone would want a home computer and he didn't like the over-confident young Jobs with his Fu Manchu beard.

Tip 4: Now is the time to open up markets no one dreams will exist in 10 years. Everyone who watches the digital industry knows the kind of story about home computers that I just mentioned. No one could envision that, soon, everyone would want a computer within easy reach. But, the new Zeitgeist film also tells the painful story of Atari. Currently, home gaming represents one third of all of the billions of dollars spent each year on entertainment. But, back when Atari was first hawking a home game console--every smart venture capitalist in the country shot down the idea. No one would want to play electronic games at home, these smart investors reasoned. Not worth risking a dime on home gaming. Boy, were they wrong!

With a surprising humility, all of the venture capitalists in this documentary urge viewers to dream about the horizon line. In the vast majority of cases, these guys--and most of them are guys--placed the majority of their best bets on dead wrong ideas. These capitalists are featured in this film as success stories because, somewhere along the line, one or two light bulbs blinked at just the right moment for them.

All of them, in chorus, say that the best time to innovate and start new ventures is when everyone else is scrambling for the exits in the midst of tumultuous change. For example, in the 1970s, when major computers were locking up on a daily basis, one guy at Tandem computers figured out the next step--and launched a billion-dollar segment of the industry that had not existed before. In the 1980s, just two people realized the potential of simply making the world's most powerful routers--the two engineers who dreamed up what today is the behemoth known as Cisco Systems.

So, sure, if you're eager for an Economy 101 lesson on the relatively recent history of venture capitalists, then watch Something Ventured. But there's a whale of a lot more wisdom in this documentary. Don't miss this good bet!",1337212800,17,5049,4.88785046728972

5070821,3,B0079ZWUW0,"Being a barely average wage earner, for me the 2011 documentary SOMETHING VENTURED feels like a visit to another planet.  By definition capitalism is using money to make money, and this film presents ten of what we now call venture capitalists, by definition those who take above-average risk with their money in order to make, in some instances, a lot of money.

While the venture capitalists in SOMETHING VENTURED are not household names, the companies on which they bet and won are, a list that includes Cisco, Intel, Atari, and Apple.  It seems as though everyone this documentary covers made a ton of cash.  Too bad SOMETHING VENTURED does not say what the entry-level employees of their firms earn, as it seems one's sense of self-worth should not determine the size of one's salary.  The venture capitalist who strikes me as most in need of humility turns out to be a supporter of the divisive, anti-worker Ayn Rand bunch.",1365638400,5,929,4.817610062893082

8513090,3,B0079ZWUW0,"Something Ventured is a documentary celebrating Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The movie made me angry.

I have to first admit, I am not sympathetic to the people on this movie. Now, they come across as nice enough in the edited version of their conversations, but when at the close they do that thing where they show the characters at the end of the movies and give a capsule synopsis of what happened after thats what make me think somethings off. One of the guys had built and operated the worlds first fully computerized yacht. Another noted that his favorite charity was the Ayn Rand institute. They literally must have called this guy up after most of the production was done and basically asked him what do you want to be your legacy? and he said the Ayn Rand institute.

Heres the problem with that. You can talk about how good these guys are since they helped lend expertise and cash to companies at early stages when they needed the capital to grow. Perhaps we can see them as something like the Walrasian crier, helping the market work. But to think that they're the ones with the new idea, the ones really taking risk to the point where they identify with Randian principals is laughable. The Objectivism ideal is that it is the entrepreneur who is taking the risk, the individual superman who is making the world going. If anything, the VC people are parasites and leeches on the people who are making contributions to society. For every Genentech where the VC helped and ended up saving lives, theres an Apple or Cisco where the founder was kicked out unceremoniously. Thats not making the economy work better, thats predatory.

And then we have to struggle with the fact that VC as an industry has not been around forever. Now it is attached to Silicon Valley, but the question I had when I was watching this was Where was the VC that helped Edison? Business formation happened before these vulture funds came to being. But an even bigger question in terms of business formation is why has it dropped? If VC funds are really making the economy more efficient, there would be more jobs created by these new firms. So a chart that would show business formation would trend up, and not down (there are a lot of variables having an effect here, not just VC firms).

It also made me think about what kind of distortions these funds have on the market. There is money to be made, but there are very few Googles. So the firms have to spread their money around, hoping to have a major hit that makes up for their losses elsewhere. This does two things that I can think of. First, it takes away the incentive to go public and face the reporting requirements that that brings. Second, it increases valuations all around, boosting balance sheets on companies that really haven't figured out how to make a profit. Im thinking here specifically of Uber, which is using flows of VC money to undercut the taxi industry worldwide and its going to be horrible to see that bubble pop and all the diminished capacity that exists because everyone was chasing this phantom yield.

And finally, we have to ask if they're even that good. Most of the top flight people with long experience interviewed in this film were lamenting that they didn't give money to apple. Why didn't they see the promise in what is now one of the largest companies in the world? Jobs and Wozniak were smelly hippies with poor time management skills and mean to boot. So these titans of foresight and capital allocation didn't give them money.

Look, in a capitalist economy, incentives need to be in place so that capital is allocated to the place where it will benefit the most people. The profit motive is strong and there are a lot of winners  some much bigger than others. But we don't need to celebrate these people as heroes.",1509494400,,3806,4.612998522895126
