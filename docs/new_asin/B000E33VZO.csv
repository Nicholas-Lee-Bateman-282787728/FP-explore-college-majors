2484843,5,B000E33VZO,"""She Spies"" is one of my favorite TV shows. I'm looking forward to the second and last season becoming available on DVD. It's too bad the show was canceled after about three weeks on NBC and continued the rest of its run in syndication on late-night TV. Perhaps viewers presumed it was a ""ripoff"" of ""Charlie's Angels"". But if you view ""She Spies"" you'll see that it has little in common with the older TV series. The lthree ladies are definitely not ""damsels in distress"". The show is action-packed with martial arts . These ladies know how to use their feet and fists instead of relying on guns. I like to see ladies who know how to fight.",1408924800,,641,4.440677966101695

2484863,5,B000E33VZO,"She Spies: Bad girls gone good. They also made one heck of a DVD release. I remember watching this show originally when it aired on Saturdays, then again when it moved to Sundays. It was a fun show and had a lot to be proud of.

The cast consists of 3 beautiful women with incredible bodies and powerful moves. These women were criminals who now wear skintight outfits and fight crime. It may have originated as a ploy to gain male viewers (which they sometimes joke about) but they are also great female icons. It is always awesome to see strong female characters on TV.

These ladies are Cassie, DD, and Shane. Even though they were criminals, they were not bad guys. The show made it clear that they went to jail as a result of helping someone they loved. It was a sacrifice they chose to make. And because of their strength, they were chosen to become part of a government agency that brings the bad guys to justice. Throughout the show, they save lies without recognition. And even though it's technically their ""duty,"" it is actually something they are proud of and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

The show does an excellent job of creating three drastically different women, especially considering that 2 out of the 3 are blonde. I think out of the three ladies, DD is my favorite. She is definitely the cutest and she has a fun personality! Out of the entire cast, I think Jack is the best character. Not only is he funny, but he is also a good character to bounce jokes off of. The absence of Jack in Season 2 is the sole reason I stopped watching the show.

The Season One DVD set includes twenty episodes. The pilot is my least favorite episode, but it does its job with getting you familiar with the cast. All the episodes are hilarious and fun! Lots of fights, action, and jokes. Unfortunately, there are no extras included in this set.",1288569600,,1856,4.498516320474778

2484876,3,B000E33VZO,"This was quite the funny action show. I spent many a late night watching this show when there was nothing on TV (at 1 AM, time which it aired where I live) and enjoyed it quite a lot. The situations, the characters and the dialogue are all funny in this Charlie's Angels-type show. It has pretty good action and decent fight scenes, as well as some pretty cool, but of course ""out there"", storylines. Watch it for the fun episodes.",1202860800,,431,4.4
2484877,5,B000E33VZO,"People who keep comparing this show to Charlie's Angels is missing the point.  That this show has three beautiful women acting as ""spy"" heroines is where the similarity kind of ends.  This show has plenty of smartly-written, witty, and fresh comedic material to stand on its own.  The eye-candies are just very nice bonuses.  There was a time when this was one of the very few shows that I actually looked forward to relaxing myself and watching during the week.  It is light-hearted, funny, and never takes itself too seriously.  I am very glad the DVD is finally out -- this fan has waited for years!",1183420800,,602,4.632075471698113

2484881,4,B000E33VZO,"This may not be worth 4 stars for most people but it is entertaining and my daughters like watching it too. It's comedy in the Charlies Angels format, three skilled women with a not so skilled male leader. The comedy may be a little simple or silly for some but without it the series just wouldn't work. In the second season they got too serious and then there was no third season. If you're thinking there will be lots of bikinis you might be disappointed. There are some but it's not baywatch. I have noticed that the price went up $15.00 since I ordered it so I wonder if demand has caused the increase. I'm not sure it's worth that much.

The girls are fun and funny, the scripts often witty (though there are a few episodes where the show struggles for footing). My wife and I loved the show and miss it. Perhaps a guilty pleasure, perhaps a show too many people underestimated. The first season, at least, held moments that parodied so many cliches at so many levels that I'm betting a majority of people missed the point.

So, when do we get the second season?",1154649600,,536,4.525773195876289
2484894,4,B000E33VZO,Very funny series sending up the action genre - particularly Charlie's Angels.,1151884800,,78,5.583333333333333
2484895,3,B000E33VZO,"When I stumbled across the original summer 2002 airing of She Spies, flipping past NBC on, I believe, an early Saturday night, I thought it was some of the freshest, most inspired silliness, with some of the brightest, most attractive personalities, I had seen on TV.  I instantly fell in love with the series, and followed it through its confusing move to syndication and late night and its second season transformation.  By the time it was cancelled, it had not lost all of its wit and charm, the actors were still doing a good job with what they had, and I was sad to see it go.  But the show never lived up to its promise.  And by the end, it was often tedious, forced, cliche, and melodramatic.  Some comparisons that come to mind are Sledge Hammer!, another off-the-wall series that did not know what do with itself and was cancelled after only two seasons; and The A-Team, which deteriorated so badly in its later episodes and was also radically changed to ""more serious"" for its last season.

Almost right after the first She Spies episode, the quality became uneven, never really matching the opener.  Techniques like freeze-screen written asides to the viewer pretty much disappeared after the third episode.  The 2nd, 4th, and 5th shows were okay, the 3rd mediocre.  The show entered a real slump with episodes 6 to 10.  The series rebounded somewhat with shows 9, 13-15, 18, and 19.  But story lines seemed thinner and thinner.  This was most obvious with shows 8 and 10 (the spies trapped in their home or office by bombs or poison), 16, and 18, all of which resorted to tired, extensive use of ""flashbacks"" (often to nothing more than scenes from earlier shows) to pad a weak, ""new"" story.  No matter how hard you rooted for the show, you often got the sinking feeling as the episode went on that there was not enough story to sustain an hour show and that it was floundering.  The ""Bartum"" episode in which D.D. appears to be a ""traitor,"" and the Cassie kidnap episode are good examples, where the show is not very strong to begin with and then the story completely gives out during the drawn-out last 15 minutes.  Other episodes, like ""Damsels in De-Stress,"" 18, have some fun individual scenes (Cassie and masseuse Margo, D.D. and the herbalist) but they are constantly interrupted by over-done, poor ones (Jack's long-winded speeches to a psychiatrist incut with recycled scenes from earlier shows).

By episodes 5 and 6, characters and situations were sometimes becoming so exaggerated that it hurt any intelligible story line or basic credibility -- necessary to hold together even a show like this.  Balance is necessary, and sometimes it was way off.  This was especially damaging when it afflicted the main characters, as with Cassie breaking into a musical number in the midst of a job interview with a tough in 6, and the labored ""who's on first"" routines at the wedding in 9 and by D.D. on the airplane in 19.  But it seemed to strike Jack the worst.

Jack's quirky combination of down-to-business knowledgeability and strictness, sarcastic wit, desire to be cool, and prat-falling were original, effective, and hilarious when done well.  They often were (as in shows 1, 2, 5, 13, 14, 15, and in show 6 explaining to the spies, as they doubted the meaning of their work, that they had saved an agent with a family, in show 12 as a foil to a hilarious Cassie impersonation, and in 18 cutting off their banter with a line about ""turning to subjects worthy of our short time on earth"").  The ""La Puma"" episode was ingenious in its use of hypnosis to do fun things with the character without undermining it (the fight scene at the end is also hilarious).

But a little bit of Jack could sometimes go too long a way, as in shows 10, 16, and 18 (labored, ham-handed blabbering scenes with two female doctors and a prison inmate).  And the series abused the character by going to uncomfortable extremes of incompetence and inconsistency, as in shows 9 (where he recounts having a wild, disastrous, and utterly unprofessional affair with a now-hardened then-trainee, complete with a line about ""buttering up the boss took on a whole new meaning""), 13 (where he is presented as a shy, meek suitor of a girl-next-door cafeteria cashier), 18 (where he is presented as pathologically protective of his team due to a childhood trauma of losing pet earthworm ""Wiggles""), 19 (where, reduced to a useless, retching distraction on a plane, he asks D.D. to delete the ""fake-name"" ""Alyssa Milano -- complete schedule and whereabouts"" file of ""tax records"" on his home computer and ignore word of a ""restraining order""), and 20 (where he is so busy behaving like a high school nerd attracted to D.D. and telling and screeching at dumb jokes that he blows his cover as a customer supposedly interested in the suspect's services).  The show created a great character, who was both comic and competent in his place.  But rather than be true to the character and content to use it to best advantage, the show too often either went way over the top with it or seemed at times to feel the need to push toward a romantic, action-hero figure, which did not work at all.

At the same time, the first season sometimes (as in shows 4, 12, 20) showed a tendency that would become overbearing in the second season:  injecting an uncomfortable mix of tear-jerking sentimentalism (for example, about the women's backgrounds) into the supposedly light-weight, upbeat program.  By the end of the first season, the show looked like it was running out of gas and unsure where it was going (the direction it was apparently heading in episode 20 of having Jack and D.D. become romantically involved seemed unstable and wrongheaded as a plot device).  I feared changes were in the offing (as with The A-Team's sad last season).

Sure enough, the show was radically changed.  It tossed out one of its most interesting, vital characters in Jack, the comfortable, informal home and office sets, and a lot of the irreverent, silly tone and touches that had made the show original and a pleasure to watch (right down to the cute episode titles that ceased being displayed with season 2).  Replacing these were stiff, cardboard cut-out ""strong, handsome, silent type"" boss ""Quentin Cross,"" even stiffer and less effective guest appearances by Bruce Boxleitner as the agency head, cliche goofy gadget geek ""Duncan,"" and new character-less, stamped-out beach house home and concrete-and-glass office.  The new elements were not terribly handled, were more believable and maybe even necessary if the spy agency premise were to be taken more seriously, but they were not special or interesting.  Nor were injected dynamics between the characters in the form of tension/attraction between Cross and Cassie and Duncan's puppydog crush on D.D.

There seemed to be more plotting to the stories and situations than in the first season.  But many second season episodes seemed predictable, tedious, and recyled from other shows (Shane ""gone bad""; agency head ""murdered""; defector's daughter; kidnapped gymnast; abducted princess; island castaways).  The plot device of the spy who falls in love with, or loses to a murderous foe, his/her partner was used and overused time and again.  Some episodes were so irretrievably dreary, grim, and maudlin that they were unpleasant to watch (Cassie finding her missing mother who had been kidnapped decades earlier and brainwashed to become a spy for the Far East; bomb locked on Cassie; Shane poisoned).  Just enough humor and banter remained to preserve some continuity and interest in the series, and the cast made a valiant effort.  There were some decent second season episodes (like the psychic (""Bam!""); Cassie's double; protecting a groom; protecting a witness and his ill-behaved son; Cassie and Cross undercover at couples workshop while D.D.'s mom visits; gunmen taking over reality show).

Some reviews offer nothing more than a few words or lines of vague, gushing reaction, or some sloppy comparisons, like to Charlie's Angels, or they seem to take offense at recognizing any faults in a favorite show.  That kind of review says almost nothing useful.  It not only skims over the surface of what makes the show enjoyable to watch but also ignores the nagging problems that keep getting in the way of fuller enjoyment of it, the first time around or when returning to it.

All in all, precisely because She Spies could be so good at times, it's sad that the many talented people involved with this show were not able, even in the first season, to make a real, consistent go of it.  And it's sad that all that's left in the end are a few dozen very uneven shows salted with occasional true inspiration.",1145577600,,8723,4.851652056641942

Three sexy females being released from prison to spy for the government as She*Spies. You can see some of the Bond jokes coming and some seem almost hurtful

Sometimes this  show  takes the spy satire a bit too far. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. This show like VIP has  many INJOKES...Some seem to fall flat on their face. However when it works, its really funny

2484897,4,B000E33VZO,"In format, She Spies is reminiscent of Charlie's Angels. Three beautiful women are led by a slightly nerdy, romantically harmless, male through weekly adventures. But the similarities end with the structure.

She Spies attempts to be a satirical and clever send-up to a whole host of TV action show cliches, and it often succeeds in its humor. The action itself tends to be played pretty straight. It is in the banter and observations between the women spies, their verbal exchanges with the villains, and the women's running battle with their ""Bosley"" leader, Carlos Jannott, where the humor and the satire come out.

You expect Natasha Henstridge to be beautiful to watch and to have ""attitude""--she typically plays that type of role in her movies. If you like her in her movies, you will like her here.

Natasha Williams, plays the black female operative who is tough and proud. Her character is fairly undeveloped, but nonetheless has her fair share of witty dialogue.

But it is Kristen Miller, as the third woman of the trio who truly shines, and makes the show a cut above what you expect to find. She is cute, smart, sassy, and a little ditsy--if that sounds like a contradiction, that is because it is, and that is what makes her character so much fun to watch.

Carlos Jannott is excellent as the women's boss, with equal doses of wit and goofiness, to make his contribution to the show memorable.

All and all, She Spies is great combination of ""eye candy"" and wit.",1144195200,,1476,4.74609375
2484898,5,B000E33VZO,"Season One of She Spies was wonderful. It had humor, clever wit, double meanings to scenes and to the dialog, and it had one of the most brilliant comedy actors for the girls to play off, Carlos Jacott. Carlos was in all three of Joss Whedon's TV series, Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, one of only four people to do so. When you see his scope in She Spies you might understand why the brilliant Mr. Whedon used him so diligently. Natasha and Natashia and Kristen (how can anyone not love Kristen Miller!?) are also great, their martial arts are actually somewhat functional, and the show is just lots of fun. Dummies need not buy it: they won't get the humor. Skip season two, which lacked Carlos Jacott. Cameron Daddo added exactly nothing, and the show became dull in the sense it was commonplace, never achieving the same heights of wit seen in this season one set. However, this reviewer, who is a bit hard of hearing, sorely misses the text overlays (subtitles) that were on TV. Buy it and enjoy a fun ride. It's absolutely delightful.",1144108800,,1036,4.575268817204301

The show is off the wall, that's what makes it so great.  The only down side to these DVDs is that there are no special features whatsoever.  It would have been great to see bloopers...wow.

2484900,3,B000E33VZO,"I loved this show. However, I am disappointed by the new dvd release. heres why:

On television, before most of the commercial breaks, the image turned into a still, then transformed into a telescope sight.

At the end of the commercial break, the same thing happened but in reverse.

The new dvds are missing these bumpers. The show fades out rather quickly then fades in just as quickly.

This causes both truncation in video and music content.

During its original run, the telescope transitions were not at every commerical break, but at most of them.

Shame on MGM for cutting this episodes.

2484901,5,B000E33VZO,"Actually, She Spies is being released a week earlier than V.I.P., I believe... March 7 vs March 14.

As far as ripping off V.I.P.'s plots... you mean She Spies had plots?  Certainly, both shows had an ample supply of ""eye candy"", but what sold me on She Spies (at least, the first season) was the absolute refusal of the show to take itself seriously.

Sure, V.I.P. had Pamela Anderson referring to ""21 Jump Street"" to Dustin Nguyen, but She Spies revelled in self-referential jokes.

If you're looking for a serious espionage series, then give She Spies a pass.  If you want a light comedy that tore down the ""fourth wall"", consider the first (though I'm sorry to say, not the second) season of She Spies.

If you're not sure if you'd like it, head over to imdb.com and checkout the ""memorable quotes"" page for the show... it gives a fair representation of the comedy offered.",1140652800,,877,4.625806451612903
