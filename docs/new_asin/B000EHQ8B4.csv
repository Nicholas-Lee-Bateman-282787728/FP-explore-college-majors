I wasn't blown away by Beyonce' it was all as expected since everybody knows what a huge talent she has ,but it was the other members, Kelly and Michelle who truly stepped up to the plate and together with the fabulous Beyonce makes it one of the best R&B concerts of all time!! I am so happy this has been captured by DVD so all can know just how GREAT DC is they truly brought it better than TLC and even EnVogue in their great days!!! A must purchase!!! Just wished they incoportated a farewell tv special to go with the DVD release to let eveyone one know why they reign ""SUPREME"" in the 2000 onward!!!! But this DVD will do!!

2518865,5,B000EHQ8B4,"This DVD might just be the best album that has never been heard by the masses.  It was so good, I went on and bought the CD as well.  This might just be the best concert and special bonus material never seen by the masses as well.

I got the first CD and liked it but it was nothing like this second recording. The bonus info on this second DVD explains the difference between the first recording and this second album.  The first one was encouraged by Frontier records and strongly encouraged Billy Greer to rework some KANSAS demo's.  This second recording is really Billy Greer solo material with SUPER production by Mike Slamer.

If you purchase this second album, it's like opening that favorite present on Christmas morning.  You know,...the one you really wanted but dare not hope for such a thing.  This is the real thing full of HIT #1 melodic rock material. It is carefully crafted and results in something that I would never expect out of a LIVE recording as well as the DVD.  Billy Greer's writing tells you stories in music and verse.  It has POWER and harmony with a masterful use of phrasing and that special blend of instruments and balance.  Billy's voice is the best lead voice that has never been exposed.  It reminds me of Lou Gramm, or Steve Perry, or BonJovi or even Steve Walsh.  This is a tenor voice that can reach up high to the stratosphere.  He reminds me of Paul McCartney with the bass walking the scales around in the background but remaining subtle.  Lead bass but not out there in your face.

As you look at the players, indeed,...this reminds me of other famous groups with that perfect chemistry.  Mike Slamer plays sonic runs in his own music but it is tempered just right to blend with a Billy Greer production.  What can you say about Terry Brock to explain how important his vocals are in this mix.  These are like those special harmonies that appear with Foreigner, Journey, Styx, and the others.  Billy was wise in letting the organ/keyboards of David Manion come forward and this gives the songs a special B3 sound that no longer is around. Pat McDonald drums with just the right verosity and power to mark time shifts and crescendo.

If you are thinking about getting the CD or DVD you will be more than pleased. This is what radio rock was supposed to be.",1305504000,2,2299,4.518159806295399

2518870,3,B000EHQ8B4,"High quality production delivered with high energy albeit tasteless at times with stage dancers pulling their pants down on stage to display their ""package"" in briefs, backup singers bumping talent from behind in sexual innuendos, and a call to several males in the audience that comes too close to a lap dance for my taste. I'm all for sexuality, but this performance crossed the line on several occassions. Recommended to DC fans for its presentation, superb lighting, and strong stage performances. VQ and AQ are excellent with deep blacks, beautifully saturated color, and well balanced sound. For a classy presentation  watch Shakira's Oral Fixation, or Beyonce - The Beyonce Experience concert.",1243641600,,700,5.306306306306307

2518875,4,B000EHQ8B4,"I absolutely loved this live DVD from the DC girls. I have all of their albums and seen them in concert twice. I saw them when they were in New York and I must say that the Atlanta show was much more dramatic. All of their solo scenes were done nicely especially Michelle Williams performing ""Do You Know"". I had goosebumps while seeing her perform that record. The Survivor performance was very dramatic in a good way and had me entertained the whole time and I like how they ended the show with the waterfall in the middle of the stage at the end of performing ""Lose My Breath"". I'm sad that they aren't recording together, but I highly doubt that its completely over for Destiny's Child. I see them in a few years doing a reunion show or even record another record together.

2518884,5,B000EHQ8B4,"This concert is probably one of the best concerts i have ever been too.... it had everything... hot dancers, great music, hype crowd, and one of the greatest female groups of all time...

i thought they should have filmed this concert in houston... but it was great that the filmed it in a great city with great response....

im always lookin forward into how they perform my favourite song by the ladies 'survivor'.... honestly this is probably the best performance in the entire concert to me.... the salsa dancing, the dance break, kelly's dance intro... all that good stuff... and as a special bonus, monica shows up at the end of the song with flowers....

michelle handled her business during her set.... she even surprised me by the way she was sangin'......

another performance that i loved was the 'solider' performance... in houston mike jones & slim thug came out and did his thang!!! but on here... the original rapppers on the track came out and handled it... when T.I. and Lil' wayne came out in total suprise...

everything from the beginning from the show to the very teasin' shower from the girls i loved every single min of it....

i recommend this concer to everyone and anyone who did not see this performance....

2518885,4,B000EHQ8B4,"After watching it 5 times now in 4 days, I can honestly say that Beyonce has emerged not on ly as a star of her time, but as a star of all times.  I would put her right up there with Aretha, Patty, and Tina Marie.  Her contemporaries, Badu, Ciera, Keys, I am afraid, become Pippen-to-Jordan like in their shortcomings.  The girl -- correct that -- fully grown and fine woman is a Diva.  This DVD confirms it.

I know, I know, everyone wants to reserve judgement, and judge a body of work before proclaiming a neophyte a Diva.  Tune into Dangerously in love on this DVD, and then tell me she is not ready for the baton.  Tina, and Aretha in their prime could have matched the rendition, maybe, and Patty may be able to pull it off today.  But, they never could have pulled it off looking as good as Beyonce.  And don't tell me looks don't matter...this is entertainment, and her looks are supremely entertaining.

Oh yeah, the other two.  Kelly, and Michelle were good.  Singing gospel, Michelle, was clearly in her element.  She will not make a dime as a table dancer though, poor guy, gets pulled up on stage to sit next to the guy getting ""catered"" by Beyonce...so close, but yet so far. If Kelly asks the audience to help her one more time during her solo, I am going to peremenently edit her out of my DVD.  Michelle should get more mic time, but since Kelly is an original DC I guess loyalty wins out...not on my remote though...can we say fast forward.

As far as singers/entertainers, unless Stevie reterns to form some time soon, or the spirit of Hathaway, Gaye, Ripperton, Redding, or Lady Day enhabits another human in the near future, Beyonce is it.  High praise I know, but who else is dancing through an entire show, and singing (on key)?  I submit her performance in Bootylicious to cap off my thesis.

I welcome solid debate, but come correct.  I will.",1166918400,7,1867,4.438235294117647
2518886,5,B000EHQ8B4,"They are what I call good performers. I saw them in concert as in Miami and they know how to work a crowd as well as the stage. They are what other groups should be afraid of. They were on stage for over an hour and you couldn't even tell because they have stamina for hours. They danced, and sung all at the same time. They really transform themselves while they are on stage. Beyonce, Michelle, and Kelly it down. Literally",1166745600,,425,4.2592592592592595

Beyonce can sing, dance and knows how to work a crowd. Kelly has a powerhouse voice too. Destiny's Child consists of 3 beautiful and multi-talented black women. As a black woman myself I am so proud of them. They packed and brought the roof down in ATL!",1155168000,,440,4.432098765432099

But when i was practically forced 2 sit down and watch this Concert, I found my self first pouting, then bobbing my head, then all out dancing! I would have LOVED 2 B at this concert, especially considering that they sing the old songs as well as the new, the good and the bad, look hott, change clothes, Beyonce' doesn't steal the spotlight (except when she got that Lion King like introduction and those three songs), and best of all the seats were only about $20 for all seats!

2518891,5,B000EHQ8B4,"I was blown away when I first saw the band Streets in 1984.  That band consisted of Steve Walsh, Billy Greer, Mike Slamer, and Tim Gehrt.  Billy Greer and Mike Slamer reunited in 2000 to form Seventh Key. Their first two albums from 2001 and 2004 were favorites of mine, but unfortunately they never went on tour. Mike Slamers daughter, Nicole Slamer was then enlisted to produce a live DVD. For the first time in almost 22 years Mike Slamer performed live again before selected friends, family & guests. Joining the duo are former Strangeways singer Terry Brock (guitars/background vocals), David Manion (keyboards) and drummer Pat McDonald. Guest include Kansas violinist Robby Steinhardt and Greer's brother Johnny, who join for a breathtaking acoustic version of ""Forsaken"".

2518892,5,B000EHQ8B4,"Have we seen a female act tear up the stage the way these 3 ladies did. Get this DVD. It was fantastic. What a farewell! I loved the singing and the choreography. The throwback of our favorite ""old school"" (if you can call it that) DC songs were a great reminder of how hot they were on their first introduction to the RB world and where I was when those songs hit the airwaves! The special features were great too. It gives a great history of Destiny's Child and dispels the myth of them being an overnight success. They endured the drama and made it to the top. Beyonce' was awesome as usual, what a talent! She was born to sing and perform. Kelly went up another notch in my eyes, she's got a voice on her and her legs go on for days, and Michelle, what a sweetheart! Ladies you must get the DVD for the ""Cater 2 U"" chapter. A how to ""dance for your man"" 101. That alone was worth the 20 bucks. Enjoy!",1151625600,,904,4.112994350282486

I've never been to a Destiny's Child concert, but after watching the DVD I have new found respect for their artistry as they genuinely put on a terrific show!  All of the old Destiny's Child favorites are performed with some of the new stuff from the Destiny Fulfilled album.  Be sure to watch the ""Cater 2 U"" performance and the finale with ""Lose My Breath""",1151193600,,440,4.475
2518914,5,B000EHQ8B4,"I completely loved this DVD.  They start off by singing their older hits like ""Say My Name"", ""Bootylicious"", and ""Independent Women"".  Then they decide to do their solo performances, which helps us see the great talents Beyonce, Kelly, and Michelle have on their own.  Through seeing these performances you start to see just how talented all three are, I have a new found respect for all of their talents.  One thing I thought was that ""Cater 2 U"" was carried out for too long.

Something I found unfair was how Beyonce had 4 solo performances while the other girls only had 1 or 2, and trust, they are JUST as talented.  For a moment I was like ""is this a DC or Beyonce concert?""

Other than that, they did a great job in making the songs come to life, especially their new take on ""Survivor"".",1150329600,,794,4.43448275862069
2518915,4,B000EHQ8B4,"First off, I'm NOT a huge Destiny's Child fan and I didn't rush right out and buy this dvd.  But over the past few years I've enjoyed more than a few DC songs and when I had the chance to borrow this film I thought it might be interesting to see what the group does live.

It turned out to be a very entertaining evening.  I was prepared to skip through large segments of the show, but I found myself captivated through most of the 2hour+ performance.  Sure, there were spots that were totally over the top (Beyonce's extended entrance with Egyptian cortege, a scene that seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with the music), spots that made you scramble for the remote (Beyonce's extended ""I love you"" warbling to every section of the arena, three or four times over), and parts that seemed to repeat themselves without end (""Hey, Atlanta, how ya doin?"").  But there were many more moments of surprise and delight, such as the girls being sprung up from below onto stage, Michelle's very powerful solo performance, a troupe of remarkable dancers, the Cater 2 U sequence (in which the girls sing and dance to three men pulled from the audience), and the Flamenco style version of Survivor.

The beginning of the DVD was amazing with the group doing all their old hits and I have to say that they performed them with a lot of energy, which made them more interesting to watch. All of the girl's solo songs were amazing, it shows that they all can really sing. I wish Kelly would have sung  something else than dilemma since it really wasn't much of her singing. I also wish Michelle would have performed another song like Heard a Word too. She gets criticized so much about her voice but I have grown to love her voice. She delivers in her solo performance and Thru With Love to blow away the audience. As usual, Beyonce brings down the house. And basically the rest of the concert is amazing too, with them performing most of their current songs. What I love about DC the most is that they are not lip-syncers. Yes, I know sometimes they do do it, but a majority of the time they don't. This is a totally live concert with all of the versus sung live (the repetitive chorus parts are lip-synced, but really, who cares?) and I loved that aspect of the DVD.

Cons: There are very little cons that I have about this DVD. One of my main ones was the camera work. I know it was done this way to enhance the experience, but a little less might have been better.",1144540800,6,1377,4.251908396946565
2518921,2,B000EHQ8B4,"I think when Destiny' Child are actually singing they ain't bad. of course Beyonce commands the most attention,because she has that ""IT"" Factor,but Kelly&Michelle ain't bad either. the problem is that alot of time some songs tend to go on&on. also too much time trying to re-capture the video they put out toward certain songs. when i watch a concert I like to see&hear a Artist just doing there thing. alot of the time with DC for my money's worth they are always trying to be way too polished which leaves no real room for growth. they have gotten better over time on stage,but i still can take or leave alot of the material they do&while Beyonce has that  Star ""IT'&Glow about her alot of the material she is doing nowadays just ain't that much different than what she was doing almost 10 years back.when I watch a show like this,i'd almost wish somebody would snatch the weaves out&then see what would happen to them vocally on stage. Beyonce has been channeling Tina Turner throughout her career,but settles for a Pebbles meets janet jackson formula which truly to me underscores what she might be able to fully do if She ever just went out fully Musically natural.",1144454400,3,1170,4.6521739130434785
2518922,3,B000EHQ8B4,"Before I get into this DVD I just want to mention a few things about their previous world tour DVD.

I didn't like it, I thought their stage presence was awkward, their dancing and choreography were rudimentary and clumsy and at the time they seemed like a group that was still getting used to the glare of the intense spotlight that was on them. All in all, the 2001 world tour seemed like Destiny's Child was still dealing with the fact that they had become international stars and that concert dvd showed that they were struggling with the idea.

But what a difference a few solo projects and a few years makes! The first thing I have to say about this concert is that these girls KILLED IT! Everything from the singing to the dancing (which has improved DRASTICALLY), right down to the costume and the stage presence came off so polished that it seemed like these girls have been doing this for twenty years as opposed to eight.

In the past, all you could expect from the girls during a show was ""how are all my people on the left-side doing?!"" ""and on the right?!"" ""how about my middle?!"", which got very repetitive and boring to watch. Now, they actually interact with their audience, the best example being when they sang ""Cater 2 U"" to 3 guys that they pulled from the crowd. Now, they know how to keep a crowd going and they know how to pace a show. Watching this DVD, everything from the high-number songs to the slower ones all glided along seamlessly.

And the singing? Well I've never complained about DC's vocal ability and once again each one of them gets a chance to show off her vocal prowess. Now a lot of people criticize Beyonce because she sings so much most of the time, moreso than the other girls. But the way I look at it is that she is the power-house of the group and the public cannot seem to get enough of her so there is nothing wrong with her singing more than the other girls. With this show it seems like they made a conscious effort to get the old hits out of the way right at the start (the ones where Beyonce sings exclusively), thereby leaving more room throughout the show for Kelly and Michelle to have thier moments in the spotlight.

The ""Soldier"" dance was a bit of a rip-off of Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" choreography from the Velvet Rope Tour, but the ladies delivered in terms of attitude and sass...I loved how they popped up onstage looking so ghetto-fabolous.

The solo bits were enjoyable, although I think Kelly stretched out ""Dilemma"" too long and should have done some of her own solo songs such as ""Stole"" or ""Can't Nobody"".

And Michelle....(sigh). I really like Michelle Williams, she seems like such a great girl and she is an amazing singer in her own right. But when you put her next to Kelly and especially Beyonce, she comes off a little weak. Her rendition of ""Do You Know"" was good but it seemed to me that she was straining and when she hit those high notes, her voice sounded so high and shrill that it was kind of annoying. By the end of the performance, you can tell she was totally out of breathe...maybe it was just a bad night.

Right after her, the production level went way up and Beyonce emerged with her dancers. Once again, people will criticize her for getting too much attention. But this is a woman who exudes so much confidence and charisma in her stage show that she deserves it. Putting aside her undeniable vocal talent, Beyonce proves that she knows how to deliver onstage by incorporating theatrics, dance and a great voice. When she did ""Baby Boy"" the crowd went beyond hysterical.....need I say more?

Anyways, once DC re-united onstage again they performed ""Girl"" and from there went into ""Free"" where Beyonce seemed to channel her inner Aretha Franklin and testified to the crowd. One of the highlights was when they sang ""If"", their voices blended so well together and their harmonies were so tight that the entire arena was quiet and I can see why because their harmonizing was just gorgeous.

If I can find a fault with this show I would have to pin it on Beyonce. While I've made it very clear how much I am blown away by her singing, she has the bad habit of OVERSINGING. I don't think her performance of ""Dangerously In Love"" was as good as it usually is. Watch her ""Live In Wembley"" DVD to see a stellar performance of that song. And then she kills almost seven minutes stretching out the song towards the end so she can show off her vocal talent. We already know you are a great singer, don't stand there and do your non-stop vocal hiccups for an entire 60 seconds please! Its great to see that she is so confident in her stage show, but not at the expense of the song please.

Towards the end, they pulled out ""Survivor"" and came back for an encore of ""Lose My Breath"" which they ended with a shower. I don't know how much I liked that, it just seemed too much like Christina Aguilera's ""Dirrty"" video. Comeon ladies, you are so much more talented than this, you don't need to resort to getting wet in white Tees and jeans to get your audience to notice you.

Then right at the end they have to plug Beyonce's new clothing line and of course sing their sponsor (McDonalds) jingle.

But putting aside these minor flaws, I think that this concrt tour was a great way for Destiny's Child to gracefully end their run as the most successful female group of all time.",1144368000,8,5363,4.460204081632653
2518923,5,B000EHQ8B4,"amazing perofmrances from all three of the girls, there world domination has been proof of there outstanding talent. Goodbye to the patriarchal faces of the past. And i woudl like to point out about lpsynching. They did sing, and i bleive someone pointed out that sometimes they did not have their mics to their faces. As a british weiordo i would like to point out DID YOU REALISE, they also have a small speech mic to their clothes, which pics up the vocals as well, well done girls, you are fantastic, good luck wth your future careers.",1144281600,,539,4.56701030927835
2518931,4,B000EHQ8B4,"I am a very huge fan of Destiny's Child and I could not wait at all to purchase this DVD. I went to the concert in person and I would have to say that it was better than actually watching it on the DVD because of the adrenaline rush. The price of the DVD really shocked me because I thought it would be at least 16 or 17 dollars. But a little over 10 dollars is worth the price of this DVD. The ladies did a phenomenal job as usual but the thing that really threw me off was the fact that Beyonce had such a big intro (like it was all about her that night which it wasn't) and she song more songs than the other ladies. Leader of the group or no leader of the group, it doesn't matter, that still was not fair. She said it herself that a group should always be ""one"". But for about 10 minutes of the DVD, I thought it was all about Beyonce... it felt as though this was Beyonce Live in Wembley part 2. Kelly sang 2 songs but ""Bad Habit"" is apart of the Destiny Fulfilled album. Beyonce did 4 songs from her solo album which was so not understandable. Michelle really came through that night with her Gospel song ""Do You Know"" and I thought it was the best she ever sang! If you really love Destiny's Child I advise you to add this to your DVD collection still. You would have a good time actually trying to learn some of the dance moves like I did!!",1144022400,2,1349,4.018587360594796
2518932,4,B000EHQ8B4,The Dvd wasn't that bad my only problem is Beyonce' solo performance. Ol girl can sing but she was overdoing it and why did she have the longest intro. Michelle that girl really tore it up she had me in amazement. Kelly did good as well. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because Michelle she was really the star that nite.,1143936000,,322,4.126984126984127

ITS NOT LIKE THEY STAND IN ONE SPOT THEY DANCE ALL AROUND SO ITS ITS UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THEY LIPSYNCH THE CHORUS. THE SHOW WAS PHENOMANAL, THE STAGE, THE DANCING EVERYTHING WAS GOOD INCLUDING THE SINGING. AND AS FAR AS THE WATERFALL SO WHAT IF BRITNEY SPEARS DID IT WHO CARES!!

2518937,4,B000EHQ8B4,"I saw this show in Anaheim, CA and it was so nice to see a pop concert (meaning a show with dancers, lights and special effects) after a couple of years without shows like that. The thing everyone should know is Beyonce is not the only one with a good voice. Kelly and Michelle both have amazing voices but unfortunately since Beyonce writes the songs, she gets the lead. All three have solos. Kelly's is cute, Beyonce was just showing off and frankly did too much (4 songs and why the hell did she have that 5 minute intro with an umbrella??). Michelle's gospel solo of ""Do You Know"" really is a highlight of the show. My only issue with the show (and with Destiny's Child) is their use of backing tracks!!! Don't get me wrong, they sing their lead and verse vocals live but they have an annoying backup track of the choruses playing in every song!!! Aren't they a vocal group and shouldn't they not have to lipsynch their harmonies?? And the bad thing is they aren't even consistent with it and often stop lipsynching and talk to the crowd as the track plays. Another bad thing was all the instructions (stand up, sing along, jump, Atlanta!!), really annoying. All in all it is a very good show and caps off with Lose My Breath which features a real waterfall onstage (stolen from Britney's Dream Within A Dream Tour).",1143763200,,1320,4.481327800829876

The same as the tracks with just a little bit of huffin so if they didn't lipsynch u all woulda been complaining about that, and by the way they did acually sing quite a few parts where the track would cut out. If your a true fan it won't matter bout the rest. I thought the performance was FABULOUS and the dvd brings me right back!!!",1143676800,,422,3.976470588235294
2518939,5,B000EHQ8B4,I love this concert DVD. It is very entertaining and if you are a true DC3 fan you will love it. It was very well put together and flowed nicely. For all the people who are mad about the lip synching get a grip. These girls don't stand in one spot and sing all of their songs like alot of r&b singers do. If they did then you would have something to be mad about. They are true performers. They dance and sing trying to put on the best show that they possibly can. You ought to be glad that they at least pre-recorded it to sound like it was live. They could've just had them playing the CD version like a lot of singers that dance do when they are in concert. Anyone who dance as hard as they do shouldn't be expected to perform those songs and make it sound like they are sitting or just standing still in a studio.,1143676800,,817,4.0184049079754605

I PICKED UP THE DVD YESTERDAY AND I MUST SAY THAT I'M NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE.  TOO MUCH LIPSYNCING. IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.  DID THEY FORGET TO PUT MIKE TO THEIR LIPS?  I WAS SHOCKED THAT THERE WERE ONLY 4 MUSICANS PLAYING BACKUP.  A LOT OF THE MUSIC WAS TAPED NO DOUBT.  THEY ARE VERY PRETTY GIRLS BUT PLEASE!  STOP SHORT CHANGING THE FANS.

But, I must say as a group they have come along way. I watched the bonus features and was truly impressed. They have again truly come along way.  Forget the drama in the past, these girls have solidfied their history in the charts.

I love the fan testimonals, they are really cute.

The concert was great,  lol, that cater 2 u sequence had me on the floor.  I thought Beyonc'e was calling that dude out, but she was just joking with him, ha.

2518972,3,B000EHQ8B4,"THE GOOD

The lovely ladies of Destiny's Child returns with their second live concert DVD (Third for Ms. Knowles). All the hit songs are here, everything from ""Say My Name"" to ""Survivor"" to ""Lose My Breath"", its all here.  In addition to that, Beyonce performs her hit solo songs, ""Crazy In Love"", ""Baby Boy"", ""Naughty Girl"", and ""Dangerously In Love"".  The girls are looking more beautiful than ever and are full of energy.  Lil Wayne and T.I. were on hand for their verses on ""Soldier"".

THE BAD

While I was watching this DVD, I was wondering why are the girl lypsynching? I understand its difficult to sing and dance at the same time but there isn't too much dancing coming from them.  Also, the lypsycnhing was so obvious at times, especially during ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Cater 2 U"".  Beyonce's performances were added bonuses but if you have her DVD concert then your not missing anything.  The perfomances on this DVD are the same as they were on her Live at Wembley DVD.  Another thing that had me frowning was the performance of ""Soldier"".  Destiny's Child, much like other artists (i.e. Britney Spears, Ciara, and Jennifer Lopez) have greatly been inspired by Janet Jackson.  But, the performance of ""Soldier"" was way too much like Janet's ""Rhythm Nation"" from her Velvet Rope Tour.  The slow dramatic effects slowed the pace of the DVD and was unnecessary.

All in all if your a fan of Destiny's Child or even a fan of modern R&B/Pop then go get this, just make sure you have your remote near so you can skip certain parts.",1143504000,5,1533,4.62962962962963
2518973,5,B000EHQ8B4,"DC said in an interview that they wanted to end the group at the height of its success.  And this concert shows that these girls did, indeed, go out with an almighty BANG.

I preordered this DVD, received it yesterday, and sat right down to watch it. Let me just say that it simply blew me away. It contains everything a DC fan expects in a concert: awesome visuals, incredible chemistry on stage, and of course, gorgeous, precise vocals. The audience was wonderful as well, screaming the words to every song performed. And there were so many songs! From Survivor to Say My Name, Soldier to No No No Part II, Girl to Bug A Boo, they're all here, sung and danced with incomparible energy and precision. Of course, there are also solo performances from Beyonce, Kelly, and Michelle, showcasing each woman's ability to shine and absolutely captivate all of Atlanta. And they come together for a wonderfully exhilarating, 10-minute-long finale.

And of course, you can't forget the special features: audio tracks from all 3 ladies; entertaining fan testimonials; teasers for Kelly's new album as well as Beyonce's upcoming movie; and best of all, a 30-minute, behind-the-scenes documentary on the big, dysfunctional family-whether biological or not-that made Destiny's Child the huge success they are today. So, as you can undoubtedly tell by now, I give this DVD 2 thumbs-up. It is definitely worth the money to have one of DC's final concerts in your possession. This is a group that will be greatly missed.",1143504000,,1505,4.917322834645669
