7800974,5,1888522003,"Gary Carden is an American treasure! He is a true Appalachian storyteller, who is a master of his craft. The story of Blow the Tannery Whistle is one of the funniest, heart-warming stories  you will ever have the pleasure of enjoying. Gary engages you and brings you into the story with amazing skill and ease.  The story runs over an hour and change and when it ends you wish it would go on for another hour more. I highly recommend that you experience his story, your life will be better for taking the journey with Gary!",1355961600,,523,4.4375
