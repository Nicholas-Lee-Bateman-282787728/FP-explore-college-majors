8562403,5,B00B4K6C5M,"I purchased this set a few months ago and it is amazing how much my kids (ages 3 & 7) have already learned. The DVDs teach the kids vocabulary as well as sentence structure in a fun and entertaining way. Some of the graphics are a little odd, but it entertains my kids so I guess it works! I would recommend Dino Lingo to anyone who wants their kids to begin learning a second language.",1433462400,,386,4.16
8562404,5,B00B4K6C5M,"I purchased this for my 2 and 5 year old sons.  The kids like the characters, the great music and graphics. It keeps their attention and like to watch them.",1433376000,,156,4.2
8562405,4,B00B4K6C5M,"My kids ages 2 - 6 love these dvds, and I've learned a ton of vocabulary by sitting with them through a dvd per day (35 minutes). The dvds are cheesy, but I guess the creators know what they are doing because the kids are engaged and learning. Each dvd builds on the one before so there is more and more complexity. The only disappointing thing was the flash cards. The word and the picture are on one side with the backside blank so I don't see how they are useful to anyone who can read (my older kids and myself). I wish they would have dual side flashcards. I just threw these away. Anyway, even though the flash cards are garbage, the dvds are great and worth the money.",1402099200,,675,4.2
