Seeing it in the movie theatre of course hightens the experience so when I purchased this I was hoping to have the same experience. Let me just say I was not disappointed. Horror is my favorite genre of movie and this is a pretty good one. An interesting story followed with those sudden scary moments that make you jump out of your seat. I am not Filipino but that plays no role in being able to like this movie. I watched this with my girlfriend (who is filipina)and we both loved it. Both Kris Aquino & Claudine Barretto did a nice job. A must see movie for any Horror fan.

ALSO: keep in mind this is the Highest grossing Filipino movie of all time pulling in 186 million in 2006.",1231804800,,801,4.235294117647059
8151591,4,B000JLE7RC,"Sukob is a modest little horror film from the Philippines--it's not in the same league as the best asian horror coming out of japan, korea, or hong kong, but it's pretty good. (From what I've seen of Filipino horror films, they tend to be reliably entertaining but nothing extreme and this is no exception.)

Sukob stars Kris Aquino--Corazon Aquino's daughter--as Sandy, a young woman who finds out on the eve of her wedding that anyone who marries in the same year that a relative dies or a sibling also weds is doomed to a cursed marriage.  In a far-away village, Diana is also getting married...and she learns about the curse when the body count immediately skyrockets the day after her wedding.  Both Diana and Sandy discover a secret sister they didn't know about, and realize that finding her is the key to ending the curse forever.

Most of the horror is atmospheric--the director gets a lot of mileage out of a creepy little flower girl and some swirling leaves--and overall the story is more poignant than gory.  There's a set of dichotomies at play throughout the movie, which I thought was interesting: it's a palimpsest of urbanity and wealth on top of a humbler, darker existence.",1184198400,,1193,4.771844660194175
