8421802,5,B004BA5YRE,I have been waiting for years to find this classic comedy on DVD. It was well worth the wait. I had almost forgotten how funny it was. Danny DeVito was as funny a character in this as he was playing sleazy Louie DePalma on Taxi. If you are a fan of his get this DVD. Not many people ever heard of this movie but the ones who did love it. I am so glad I kept checking on Amazon. I knew it would show up sooner or later..,1324252800,,419,3.772727272727273
8421803,4,B004BA5YRE,"I've seen The Mogul title and it was great fun. A really cute movie. No problems with the sound or picture.

Maybe some of the negative commentators need to have their DVD players cleaned.",1311897600,,188,4.529411764705882
