3845849,4,B0024FAG80,"I agree with the many positive reviews already posted - Murder by Contract, The Lineup and The Sniper are all classics that are finally being released on dvd. 5 Against the House is entertaining as well, though I'm not sure we needed yet another release of The Big Heat, which most noir fans will already own. While I think more commentaries would have rounded out the collection better than the short presentations by other directors, my only serious complaint refers to the commentary on The Lineup. I usually enjoy Eddie Muller's insightful and knowledgeable commentaries, and got a kick out of his rather raucous collaboration with the novelist James Ellroy on the Crime Wave dvd. Yet if Ellroy's reference to himself as the ""white knight of the far right"" was a little confusing during that commentary, here he becomes more provocative. After dubbing himself once more the ""white knight of the far right"" Ellroy revels in the film's depiction of 1950s San Francisco as a ""white man's America"" (or something to that effect) and then offers homophobic comments on the museum curator before inserting some racially offensive remarks about Obama and black campaign workers. On several occasions an apparently nervous Muller tries to rein Ellroy in, but without success -- this is all within the first 20 minutes or so, after which I turned the commentary off. Is this for real?

While I respect Ellroy's skill as a novelist and his considerable knowledge of the 1940s and 50s, whatever insights he might have brought to this film were eclipsed by his unfortunate desire to offend and perplex rather than instruct. Even if this were all part of his deliberately overblown public persona, many filmlovers could do without Ellroy's self-indulgent nonsense. Aside from this the set is well worth owning.",1263772800,19,1800,5.0200668896321075
3845850,5,B0024FAG80,"First of all, I would like to thank everyone who made this collection happen!  I love film noir and especially the original american film noir.  The origins of film noir are debated by many film scholars, critics and just fans in general.  However, it doesn't matter where film noir came from, all I know is that the american film noir movies were the best.  ""The Lineup"" has one of the worst cold blooded psychopaths in the history of all noir and of movies in general.  Eli Wallach plays the maniac hit man so real and scary.  From what I have read about real life hit men, Wallach got it as close as you can to reality in this movie.  ""Murder By Contract"" has not ever been available on video.  ""Murder By Contract"" is a treasure for those who love film noir.  All of these 50s film noir are innovative, cool and fun to watch 40 years or more later.  Looking at these films you can see how influential and ispirational they must have been to the new wave of filmmakers that arose shortly afterwards all over the world not just the Nouvelle Vague in France, but in the U.S. as well.  In my opinion this is the best collection of film noir on dvd out there.",1262822400,2,1158,4.314814814814815

3845852,2,B0024FAG80,"Being true film buffs, we purchased this set for the Holidays.  During the viewing of at least two of the selections - we kept looking at each other saying:  Is this really Film Noir?  ""The Big Heat"" was terrific, ""The Lineup"" was also very good and we had seen it on Turner Classics.  Then it went downhill from there.  ""5 Against the House"" was a bizarre take on Film Noir, but watching Guy Madison (Wild Bill Hickock) was fun.  ""Murder by Contract"" - B movie all the way.  I'm sure I must have seen this at the drive in sometime in the early 60's.  Poor acting.  Good golly - the actresses were just AWFUL! And it took hours to get the dreadful music (mandolin/guitar) out of my head.  We haven't watched the ""Sniper"" yet.  A bit afraid of wasting another evening.",1262044800,4,767,4.368794326241135

Besides ""Big Heat"" (arguably Fritz Lang's best film of the fifties), this remarkable package is a very rare opportunity to have a look at ""The Sniper"" in pristine condition and, above all, to discover the rarest of noir gems : Irving Lerner's ""Murder by Contract"", one of the coolest thrillers ever made.

3845856,5,B0024FAG80,"The Sniper features an audio commentary by author Eddie Muller. He starts off talking about the origins of the film - a husband and wife writing team. He mentions that it was a very controversial film at the time because of its subject matter. Muller provides all kinds of fascinating production details, like how much of the film was shot on location in San Francisco. He explains that The Sniper is a landmark film because it was one of the first to prominently feature a serial killer.

""Martin Scorsese Presents The Sniper"" features the legendary filmmaker talking about the documentary feel of the film thanks to the use of authentic locations.

Also included is an original theatrical trailer.

The Big Heat starts off with ""Michael Mann on The Big Heat."" He speaks admiringly about the prominent female characters in the film. The director talks about the ethnic aspect of the film as well as the uncompromising nature of Glenn Ford's character.

""Martin Scorsese on The Big Heat"" features the director talking about how Ford's character becomes what he's fighting against. Scorsese draws particular attention to the flat look of the film and how director Fritz Lang directs us to the behaviour of the characters.

Also included is the original theatrical trailer.

The only extra for 5 Against the House is the original theatrical trailer.

The Lineup includes an audio commentary by author Eddie Muller and James Ellroy. Muller says that this film started off as a television show cut from the same cloth as Dragnet. He plays the straight man on this track, rattling off facts, while Ellroy is his usual colourful and profane self offering his bizarro opinions on this film. He sings the praises of Don Siegel's more than capable direction. Fans of Ellroy will love this track as he gets to cut loose have some fun commenting on The Lineup.

""The Influence of Noir with Christopher Nolan"" sees this respected director citing noir as an influence on his own work, most notably the psychological states of the characters, the atmosphere and the style in relation to the substance and how they all interact with one another.

Also included is the original theatrical trailer.

Murder by Contract features ""Martin Scorsese on Murder by Contract."" He reminisces about when he first saw the film as a teenager and how it would later influence aspects of Taxi Driver. The director speaks admiringly of the ""economy of means"" - how Irving Lerner depicted the passing of time. Scorsese gives us a brief background to Lerner and talks about how he got to know and even work with him.

3845857,5,B0024FAG80,"This set contains 5 films and no extra features have been announced. The set is due to go on sale November 3 along with a volume 2 of film noir from Sony on the same day. Sony continues to hit it out of the park with classic sets being announced rather regularly this year. The films in volume one are as follows:

The Sniper (1952) - directed by Edward Dmytrik and starring Adolphe Menjou, Arthur Franz, and Gerald Mohr. A San Francisco detective traces a series of seemingly random killings to a sharp-eyed loner who uses his rifle as a means to exact deadly revenge on the women who have rejected him.

5 Against the House (1955) - directed by Phil Karlson and starring Brian Keith, Guy Madison, Alvy Moore, and Kim Novak. Four college pals plot to rob a casino in Reno just to prove it can be done, but their plan to return the money is threatened when one of them intends to keep it for himself. Probably the weakest film of the lot.

The Lineup (1958) directed by Don Siegel and starring Eli Wallach and Robert Keith. When a mother and her young daughter unknowingly destroy a stash of heroin, a pair of hit men must keep them alive long enough to explain it to their boss. Eli Wallach makes a great villain and the scenes of San Francisco 50 years ago are interesting too.

Murder by Contract (1958) directed by Irving Lerner and starring Vince Edwards as a well-mannered college-educated young man who just figures that being a hitman is a good way to make a living. Claude is usually philisophical yet mechanical about his hits, but when he is hired to kill a woman who is about to turn in evidence against the seedy mobster he works for everything starts to go wrong for him.

The Big Heat (1953) directed by Fritz Lang and starring Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame,and Lee Marvin. Ford is a cop trying to clean up mob violence in his town, but when he gets too close to success a car bomb meant for him kills his wife. This puts Ford on an unstoppable quest for justice since this has now become personal. Grahame stars as a good-hearted moll and Marvin as a mobster with an unpredictable temper. This is the best film in the bunch.

Part of the above information is directly from the press release and part of it is from my own memory of the films. Rumor has it that Martin Scorsese picked the films that went in this and volume two of Sony's film noir sets.

** This review may contain spoilers ***

Awesome old film noir that boasts an impressive collection of bad guys (Richard Jaeckel as a dipsomaniacal wheelman, Eli Wallach as a psychopathic bagman enforcer). A mysterious heroin kingpin called ""the man"", Robert Keith as a vicious but intelligent mentor to Eli Wallach (Robert Keith, you'll know as Richard Kimble's father in ""The Fugitive"" and episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"") he likes to write ""last, or end quotes"" from the people Eli Wallach murders in a little black book.), a suave trench coat wearing fingerman, and a couple of really dry and boring, but procedural, head cops.

This is a ""daytime"" film noir. Eli Wallach is superb as a bad guy.

Good locations as well in the San Francisco area, a city where I lived. The Veterans Building (opened in 1932) in the Civic Center Historic District, the Mark Hopkins Hotel (1926) on Nob Hill, Cliff House and Sutro Baths (swimming pool complex but ice skating rink in film, torn down), The Legion of Honor museum, the elevated double-decker Embarcadero Freeway (demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake), the Seaman's Club (YMCA of San Francisco Building), Steinhart Aquarium (California Academy of Sciences - damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, torn down), De Young Museum (damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, torn down), United States Customhouse, the Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge Highway and plenty of old docks and piers.

Has some silly stuff like a cop in the Golden Gate Park picking out the car of bad guys based on the driver having a ""tan"", and a cop on the north end of Ocean Beach (Cliff House and Sutro Baths area) picking out the car of bad guys again, but still a wonderful film.",1405900800,,1746,4.905084745762712

3845890,5,B0024FAG80,"The Lineup, 1958 film

A ship docks at Pier 41 in San Francisco. A man drives away wildly in a taxicab, hitting a truck after running into a policeman (who shoots him). Why? The man in the taxicab had no identification. The man whose suitcase was stolen describes the contents. Nothing of value except for some trinkets he bought abroad. The dead man's gun can't be traced, the serial number was gouged out. ""Lefty"" Jenkins had a record as a wheelman. The police found a bag of heroin hidden in that statuette! They replace it with a bag of milk sugar, then return the suitcase to Mr. Dressler. He checks the contents and agrees to try to identify the porter who took his bag. Dressler will be tailed. Detective Guthrie visits the Customs Department, they can't catch them all. Innocent travelers are used to unknowingly smuggle drugs. The porters at the docks attend the lineup, five at a time. None are recognized.

The detective visits Jenkins' tiny room and find his drug paraphernalia and clues. The body of a porter is found in the sea (he was in the lineup). A four-engine airliner lands at San Francisco airport. A man in a car meets two travelers to drive them away. This driver likes to talk. They meet a contact at the docks, he identifies the people who have the drugs. Dancer will deliver the goods via a ""dead drop"". Julian explains this operation to Dancer. He calls the ""Seaman's Club"" to arrange a meeting to pick up that horse. ""Why be greedy?"" The detectives investigate the murder of Warner and get a description of a man. The horse statuette is shattered! Dancer visits a big mansion to collect the flatware. The servant's objection is overruled. Dancer doesn't leave witnesses. A mounted policeman sees two men with heavy tans, he calls it in with the license plate.

Dancer and Julian look at the doll bought in Tokyo. Cindy cries at the mistreatment of her doll. Dancer is warned about his plans, they must use the woman to explain the loss of the goods. They stop at ""Sutro's"" museum which has many visitors. Dance watches the drop site. A passing motorcycle cop notices the gray sedan parked by on the street. Julian explains why women have no place in crime or law enforcement. Dancer explains the shortage to the messenger. ""You're dead."" Did he speak too soon? The crowd screams at this event. The detectives arrive outside. Dancer runs up the stairs. Shots are fired. The gray sedan speeds away as the police follow. The road ahead is blocked. Can the villains escape? The car speeds onto a Freeway ""under construction""! Are they trapped? Dancer dissolves the partnership, then goes over the side of the bridge to escape. The whistle sounds at 4:40 PM, its all over on schedule.

This drama seems to be based on a true crime because of the way it is written. The faults and quirks of the criminals seem realistic. The plan of the criminals seems perfect, but they don't allow for the unexpected. You can figure out the fate of the driver if Dancer and Julian completed their operation. And the single mother and her girl. Note the lack of traffic in San Francisco then. What else has changed since? Don Siegel went on to produce many more action films in the future. ""The Asphalt Jungle"" was a perfect crime story. Its planning was perfect except for what happened after the crime. Other stories, like ""The Big Knockover"". had a similar stories.

The Sniper, 1952 film

It begins in a bedroom overlooking city streets. A man takes an M1 Carbine from a dresser, loads it, and aims it at a woman. [The steep hills say San Francisco.] He walks aimlessly on the streets, then goes to use a pay phone. Edward Miller wants to talk to Dr. Giletter, but he is on vacation. The ER treats a patient with a burned hand. The doctors know it was self-inflicted. ""I don't know."" Eddie works by delivering clothes for a cleaner. Later at night Miller goes to the roof of a building with his carbine. Jean plays the piano in a bar. Then shots ring out! The police check the building across the street. Miller goes to another bar. [We see his character.] The next day he delivers a dress. We see his attitude, and what he does with that dress. Who say him?

The newspaper headlines tell of the ""Rifle Fiend"". The police get a letter: ""stop me before I kill again"". They check their records for suspects. Men are rounded up for line-ups, detectives watch them. [Is this a joke?] Usually the victim knows their assailant. The psychiatrist profiles the killer: he will continue until he is caught. Miller watches a television set in a store. There is a shooting of a prominent woman! Do newspapers slant the news to create sensations? [Yes.] An insane person is one who can't tell the difference between right and wrong? [Who decides?] An expert predicts the killer has a record. Can they treat everyone arrested for a sex crime? A newspaper publisher threatens a reprisal. Policemen with rifles are placed on tall buildings. They see a man with a rifle and arrest him! He is taken to the hospital. There is another victim and a clue in a park. Miller goes to an amusement park and shows his aim.

The police use that clue to trace its wearer. They read the reports. ""Baseballs?"" A woman hears the reports and goes to the police. Miller is on a roof again! A painter on a chimney yells out a warning! There is a shot. Miller climbs down the fire escape and runs away. [The streets seem deserted for daytime.] Miller returns home unexpectedly. He reassembles his carbine. [Anyone recognize this neighborhood?] The police arrive, one has a Tommy gun. The police call on Eddie to surrender. People gather outside as if this was a sporting event. The police order Miller to come out with his hands up. ""All right Eddie, let's go."" And so it ends. What happened next?

This movie must be based on a True Crime (that was changed for this story). It asks for adequate treatment for the mentally disturbed. But people object to the taxes it would cost! [Or maybe the Establishment would not benefit?] Harry Brown wrote ""A Walk in the Sun"" and the script for ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"". This story could not be popular even if it is educational. It was not designed to be scary (like ""Psycho""). Do mental health facilities receive adequate funding today? Or is it considered an expensive frill? The mass shooting in Newtown (and elsewhere) may not have happened if school authorities acted properly to prevent Bullying, and there was adequate care for a teenager. Was he the only one with problems in that school? Yet nothing was done afterwards except to try to restrict people's rights. I wonder if any drug usage can cause a future problem for an unborn child?",1334188800,,6661,4.619087837837838
3845891,4,B0024FAG80,"*****  THE BIG HEAT

Here's another film I use to watch when I despair of cinema's future. Gloria Grahame's performance is unique as well as Lee Marvin's. Masterpiece.

**  5 AGAINST THE HOUSE

Weak crime movie with an interesting Brian Keith performance. That's all.

*****  THE LINEUP

An extremely brisk beginning, a pair of villains that will haunt you for days, Richard Jaeckel as the alcoholic wheelman, social etiquette taught by a gay Pygmalion to a psychopathic hit man. 86 minutes of sheer pleasure. Masterpiece.

*****  MURDER BY CONTRACT

I understand now why Martin Scorsese admired so much Irving Lerner. With a simple guitar melody playing while Vince Edwards is dressing up, Irving Lerner emerges as a one of a kind director. The rest of Murder by Contract is in accordance with this mythical beginning. Masterpiece.

***  THE SNIPER

Progressive Stanley Kramer production. The murders, in my opinion, are very violent considering it's a 1952 movie. Recommended.",1322697600,5,978,5.146496815286624
3845892,2,B0024FAG80,"The weakest film here is the 1955 heist film 5 Against the House. A group of four college students briefly visit a Reno casino called Harold's, learn firsthand of its overzealous security staff, and are warned of the joint's supposed invulnerability. The egghead of the group takes this as a challenge, and devises a preposterous heist plot that will leave modern viewers snickering in disbelief as the group's outrageously suspicious activities fail to arouse the previously hair-trigger security cordon.  Interest is offered by several location shots, including a Reno parking lot with a nifty car forklift, but these hardly warrant a viewing recommendation for what is otherwise a clunker of a film.

Murder by Contract from 1958 is only a marginal improvement. Vince Edwards's chilling portrayal of the amoral contract assassin is undermined by his accomplices' buffoonery and his comically low-tech attempts (including shooting a flaming arrow and sneaking through a storm pipe) to circumvent a target's police protection to complete the hit at the center of the film's plot.

Don Siegel's The Lineup from 1958 opens with a bang as a robbery attempt leads to the death of a cop and one of the thieves. The ending is gripping as well: a dramatic chase scene follows a riveting encounter between a mob boss and one of his underlings. The movie also boasts great location shots in San Francisco and a taut performance by Eli Wallach, but it gets bogged down in a routine plot and uninspired acting by most of the leads.

Edward Dmytryk's The Sniper from 1952 is the sleeper in this collection. Arthur Franz gives a credible performance as the tormented soul who elicits both sympathy and revulsion as he goes on a killing spree targeting women in San Francisco.  The pacing is taut except for a few scenes where Richard Kiley's police profiler character nearly drags the proceedings to a standstill with his lame psycho-babble. The killings are strikingly visceral even without any gore, and the location shooting lends a gritty realism to the film, especially so in an unforgettable scene where a tower worker spots the sniper lining up another victim in his sights and unleashes howls for help that seem to rain down from heaven itself.  This film is far better than the previous three, and is also a far stronger example of noir atmospherics.

The Big Heat is a classic film noir that will be familiar to most viewers with even a passing interest in the genre.

Overall I'd give this set 2.5 stars. Amazon requires integer ratings, so I'll factor in the vague misrepresentation of 3 of the films as film noir and the insulting and vile commentary track on The Lineup and round down to 2 stars.",1321401600,3,2698,4.901315789473684

3845896,5,B0024FAG80,"Over the past decade, I have bought many film noir box sets. Yet for some reason, not one of these films was in any of them. These films, having been made by a generation of film-makers who were my parents' contemporaries and during the time when they were young adults, never crossed my radar as a young man. So as much as I like the genre of film noir, essentially each older noir film I encounter is entirely new to me. And so every box set is a cinematic adventure.
Columbia Pictures Film Noir Classics Vol 1 is an attractively packaged but quite a bare-bones affair when you compare it with some of the lavish box sets that have been released this century. What you get is a CD for each film, subtitles if you want them, and a little commentary on a couple of them. There is no booklet that would have been very useful in sorting out who is who and who played what. The only real film info is the summary of each film printed on the back of the box that holds the DVD set. With one exception, I greatly enjoyed the entire set and there is enough red meat for the noir aficionado to launch this into five-star territory.
I like three of the films so well that its really a toss-up as to which is my favorite, but here are my favorites from first to worst and why they score that way:
1)The Lineup: Its hard to beat San Francisco as the backdrop for a great crime movie. This one pits some hard-bitten and determined cops against some exceptionally amoral and even evil characters involved in smuggling heroin from Asia. The movie is helped by the credibility of most of the story line and even minor characters play their parts oh so well. Then you have the sights of one of the world's finest cities, San Francisco, to add to your viewing pleasure. All the main characters are first rate, kudos also to the woman and her daughter taken along on the wild ride that brings the movie to its gripping climax and also to the drug dealer's courier in the wheelchair whose few minutes of evil presence on screen you will remember long afterward.
2)Murder By Contract: Vince Edwards shines as a hired killer in this enigmatic and spartan thriller. His qualms about offing a woman become his undoing. The haunting score sets the mood and keeps you focused on the action. The ending is a surprise and Edwards' character Claude never gets that house on the Ohio River he's been saving his blood money for. In many ways, this one has a very European flavor to it despite its being filmed in Los Angeles.
3)The Big Heat: A fairly pedestrian story of big-city corruption and venality brought to thrilling life by Fritz Lang. Lee Marvin is magnificent as an out of control gangster whose brutality sometimes even shocks his associates. When good cop Glenn Ford's wife is killed by a car bomb meant for him, he demands that the milquetoast police chief Higgins bring the perps to justice. But Higgins' non-committal and evasive response convinces him that if he doesn't smash the culture of impunity himself, no one will. And so he does.
4)The Sniper is another film with San Francisco as a setting. I like the film, but at times it gets a little preachy and the main character a little overwrought and not really credible. The sniper himself is a lonely loser who lets his pent-up rage at rejections real or imagined from women he encounters boil over into a full blown shooting rampage. When he is pointed out perched on a rooftop by a workman on Coit Tower, he shoots the workman, makes a break for it and seemingly escapes. An earlier self-inflicted injury proves to be his undoing as it is the one thing that the police know about him and can tell the public to be on the alert for. His landlady turns him in, and he is captured like a cornered animal without further bloodshed in his apartment while a circus-like atmosphere prevails on the streets outside. This actor had to be in good shape, because as he ran up and down hills and staircases around San Francisco, I found myself getting winded just thinking about what he must have experienced!
5)5 Against the House. This one started out as kind of a really dumb college buddy movie that tries real hard to be simultaneously clever and funny. As the industry reviewer says, the lame quips will quickly get on your nerves as will having to imagine a couple of silly-looking cusses being partners in crime. Kerwin Mathews and Alvy Moore are not only silly-looking, they are first-class doofuses. You can't really imagine how the two came to be friends with the serious-minded Guy Madison and his army buddy Brian Keith in the first place. I won't rehash the inane plot, suffice to say that the best part is toward the end where this bunch actually looks like they are going to pull their planned casino robbery off. The sweating fat man that plays the terrified casino employee who looks in serious danger of soiling himself does some of the best acting in the film. Then there is Kim Novak for eye candy.
While there are some noirish elements introduced about halfway through the movie, no way should this be considered in the same league with the other four.
Overall, I judge this set to be an excellent value for your entertainment dollar that last turkey notwithstanding. If you enjoy the film noir genre and do not already own these films, now is your opportunity. Highly recommended!",1269993600,,5336,4.553590010405827
3845897,3,B0024FAG80,"I'd seen and enjoyed 4 out 5 of these Columbia films and considered them good enough to add to my library when Amazon put this set on sale for $32.00. ""The Sniper"", ""The Big Heat"" and especially ""The Lineup"" are excellent. ""Five Against the House"" is not quite as good but more than watchable thanks to an excellent cast, Phil Karlson's capable direction and on location (Reno) filming. The only film I hadn't previously seen, ""Murder by Contract"" was a big disappointment. I totally fail to see why Martin Scorcese admires this one so much. To me it looked like something directed by Ed Wood, almost (but not quite!) so bad that it is good! Wood's ""Jail Bait"" comes to mind, not only because of the Godawful musical score of both of them!. In his Classic Movie Guide Leonard Maltin gives ""Murder by Contract"" only 2 stars, says it is ""ultimately sabotaged by pretentious dialogue and posturing"". I couldn't agree more! Four out of five ain't bad though and I do recommend this package. Excellent transfers (three of them anamorphic widescreen). Several commentaries and featurettes and theatrical trailers are bonus treats.",1264550400,19,1124,4.890052356020942
8350510,5,B0024FAG80,"I wish to comment on the movie ""The Lineup"" that is in this set. I enjoyed the film with it's on location filming, the noir story and my favorite radio star ""Bob Bailey"" who plays a bit part as ""Staples"" (@ 30 minutes into the film). Bailey played the leading role in ""Your's Truly Johnnie Dollar"" from 1955 until 1960. It is one of my favorite old time radio shows dealing with crime dramas. The vary strange thing about this DVD set and this movie's commentary track where mister noir himself ""Eddie Muller"" did not mention that Bob Bailey was a super radio star. As a matter of fact, Eddie barely knew his name. Come on Eddie you are the ""Noir King"" and you should have given us some info on Bob Bailey.",1522108800,,706,4.315789473684211
8350511,5,B0024FAG80,"This Film Noir DVD set contains 5 movies.  All five movies are pretty good to very good.  Perfect?  Of course not.  You can criticize certain details, such as ...

Warning: There are some spoilers that follow...

... the contract killer in Murder by Contract so easily getting the house plans of the house of the star-witness in an upcoming trial.  But the movie in its entirety was excellent (with a great musical score).  Or the fact that The Sniper was pretty good despite serving as an obvious PSA about the need to do something about psychopaths roaming the streets.  The ending was less than expected, so far as what you think is about to happen and the specific type of sounds you feel sure you are about to hear.  I can't decide if the ending was a bit of a letdown on not.  Anyhow, criticisms aside, these five movies are all very good examples of Film Noir and worth watching.",1496188800,,886,4.475
8350512,5,B0024FAG80,"IMAGE AND SOUND QUALITY: Very good. No complaints. FILM COLLECTION: The Sniper (1952) is a very rare noir classic. My rating of it is 8 out of 10. The commentary track to this one is pretty informative and interesting. I recommend checking it out in full after you watch the film. The Big Heat (1953) is a great Fritz Lang noir. My rating of it is 9 out of 10. I strongly recommend checking out Roger Eberts review of the film. It deepened my understanding of and appreciation for the film dramatically. Murder by Contract (1958) is a wonderful noir. The soundtrack is unique (sort of reminded me of The Third Man) and provides a curious, tragi-comic mood to the film. The contract killer is a somewhat interesting character but its his two handlers on the big job that give the film much of its unique flavor as well as its lighter/quirkier moments in an otherwise grim film. My rating of Murder by Contract is 9 out of 10. The Lineup (1958) was the one that I was most pleasantly surprised by and my favorite in this collection, due mostly to the two main villains. It is part police procedural, but that side of the film is the least interesting side. The villains, however, are really interesting and curious characters and it is with them that the film finds its energy and displays its power. These two villains are among the best pair of villains in film noir, right up there with Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson of Double Indemnity and Annie Laurie Star and Barton Tare of Gun Crazy. My rating of The Lineup is 9 out of 10. The commentary track on The Lineup is also worth checking out. It includes noir author James Ellroy and, well, hes a character, enthusiastically introducing himself as the white knight of the far right. He comes on strong at the beginning of the commentary track, but seems to become more calmly reflective by the end. That leaves the final film in this collection, 5 Against the House (1955), which I didn't care for at all. Four wonderful, creative noirs; only one dud. I highly recommend this collection.",1494288000,,2043,4.584699453551913
