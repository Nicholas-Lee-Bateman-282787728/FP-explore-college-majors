3167372,1,B00175VSBW,"Mandy Gilbert (Ashley Tisdale) is stuck in obscurity.  Not only is she geeky, but her father is a bit of an overprotective control freak and her cell phone is stuck in the dark ages.  She does have two good friends, but that's about it.

Since seventh grade, she has had a crush on Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).  And, the day before her eighteenth birthday, decides to do something about it.  Much to her surprise, it's not as hard as she thought it would be.  He even invites her to be his date at a party he is giving this weekend.

However, things take a turn for the worse when her dad (Kevin Pollak) grounds her for almost no reason.  She manages to get a reprieve, but only to study.  Now she must figure out a way to get an outfit and get to the party, all while fooling her dad with her new, flashy camera phone.  But as the situations get out of hand, can she pull it off?

From the brief preview I caught on ABC Family, I thought this made for TV movie might be fun.  I was wrong.  Instead of a relaxing hour and a half, I spent the entire time cringing as Mandy moved from one bad experience to another.  I did find a couple scenes amusing, but that was about it.  None of the characters were that sympathetic.  And the moral about parents learning to let go sends a bad message to the intended teen audience.  Despite the fact that the film debuted on ABC Family, I'd give it a strong PG-13 rating for content as well.

Those looking for a light movie will be disappointed.  Instead, it glorifies teen rebellion and vilifies parents.  Even though there were a couple clever scenes, I won't be watching again.",1216598400,2,1621,4.304635761589404
3167373,3,B00175VSBW,"Picture This! Is basically fluff, exactly what I was expecting. Teen romantic comedies have gone downhill since the days of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Things-I-Hate-About-You/dp/B00000K31Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Things I Hate About You</a>. But then again, this is a made for movie so expect exactly such.

The movie stars Ashley Tisdale Mandy, as a nice and smart, middle social class girl who has a crush on the hot and rich guy in school, who by the way is also perfect and has won every single medal in every single sport. He is Prince Charming. He finally notices her and invites her to his party as his date. But, Mandy is grounded and, thanks to her new video phone (tons of product placement in this movie), her dad is keeping tabs on her every half hour. Mandy must race against the clock and get in all sorts of implausible situations to go to the party and fool her overbearing father that she is studying at a friend's house. Between ruined clothes, allergies, towed cars, and a battle of the bands, Mandy has her work cut out for her. But, still to top it all up, the evil rich and popular girl is out to get her.

The movie is funny because it has so many implausible situations that you just have to go with it. The movie also shows the influence of technology and media in the current culture. Nice use of gadgets. Now, I must get that phone (the true main character of this movie!).",1216252800,28,1457,4.824
3167374,5,B00175VSBW,"I saw the premire of this movie and although it is girl likes jock, popular girl declares Jock hers and tries to kill girl socially. It was a really cute father daughter (or parent letting go) movie. As a HS guaduite, I thought this was a great movie to watch with my mom, and i was right. Shes been having seperation issues, like Ashley's Dad, and it was a fun movie to watch and connect with. Even my teenage brother thought it was a hilarious movie, watching all the things Ashley has to go through. From phone punking her Dad to convincing an audience to pretend to be a DVD movie.
I thought it was a really good movie!
Great job Ash!
Oh one more thing I really liked about it is the main character stayed true to herself. She didn't let the guy use her.",1216080000,21,758,4.198630136986301

But when I watched it, there are still scenes that don't add up, going from one place to the next without officially going/showing it on the camera. Just all of a sudden poof and then you're there!

However, it was still a good movie line, but I wish it was better acted out, and more something that younger girls could relate too, instead of thinking that lying can solve all your problems.",1447804800,,508,4.347368421052631

But no one seemed to care, unless an average looking guy who was also rich  and participated in underage drinking and sex liked her. NO thank you. And the popular girls... WTF? Apparently all it takes is money to be popular, cause these were not good looking, smart, talented girls... they were gross and fixated on the boy, too. So, the only thing in life we have is men to make us feel better, I guess. Thanks amazon for recommending this horrible movie to a 30 year old.

But as far as teen rom-coms go, this movie is practically unwatchable. The acting is plain awful. The basic premise of the story is interesting enough but the filmmakers failed to deliver it in a convincing way.
Luckily I was able to fold laundry while this was on so it wasn't a total waste of my time.

I feared a seriously corny, poorly acted, fumbling, stupid, typical movie--and my fears were not realized while watching this movie!  It was not corny, poorly acted, fumbling, stupid, or typical (in that it would have been all those things).  The acting was actually pretty good--I feel like the ""mean"" girls' delivery/portrayal was the worst in the film (that's not to put them or their acting down, personally).  I feel like the movie wasn't typical in that Tisdale and her dad actually had a good relationship--she wasn't trying to go against him out of lack of respect.  Also, aside from being a little overbearing with his love, the dad didn't totally ignore the desires and words of his daughter, like in so many other movies.  I especially liked that Tisdale didn't change herself to be liked, and her friends were true friends, not people who were just ""yes"" men or ones who egged her on to give up who she truly was and do whatever, just for the sake of popularity.  Long story short, because I could be here all day writing about how this movie is atypical, despite its typical genre.  Oh, and I like that they didn't turn Tisdale's character into this total spaz, who turned into this non-spaz--she was just a normal girl, who didn't happen to be popular.

Of course you have to add in the ""I can't tell the truth, what would they think if they knew I had an allergy to nuts?""
  This movie is just icky sticky self centered, do it now or die forever, if we keep mentioning sex it will sell the movie, teenage mentality drama.
And I am not sure when a thong could ever be considered ""grannie panties"" even in a teenage movie.  And the fact that a boy can dump his girlfriend for you and that doesn't raise any reasonable red flags.  Getting an entire bar (How did they get into the bar?) to fall for your pitiful sob story and be absolutely quiet while you lie to your parent....it was too TV reality for me.

 It could be light hearted fun if you don't take the movie seriously.  (Which, I am sure,  is exactly how it is intended)
 Generally I like teenage drama movies.  I like the lighthearted and the desperation for social acceptance that attends the teenage drama.  But, in this movie there are too many innuendos.  The entire thing is to cliche, to stuck in the queen teen drama with a little slapstick.  Total non-reality consequences.

I did watch it all the way through, but if there was a 2 1/2 star option, that's what I'd give it.",1378080000,,371,4.537313432835821
3167451,2,B00175VSBW,"I went into this movie not expecting much except for a common teen romcom. this movie is about a girl who has an overprotective dad who cant let go of his 18 year old daughter. the girl likes a hottest guy in school and when he finally notices her she is grounded for it(sorta). it features all the common things, the perfect guy, the evil girlfriend, the group of best friends, etc. it just fails at alot of what it tries to do.

the movie starts off with mandy narrating about the town being divided into the high class and the mid-low class. the film doesnt do much to develop on this. mandy often describes herself as low class and works at a pet shop for minimum wage, but her dad is an architect and she lives in a big fancy house. this movie is more about avoiding dad by using her video phone so she can get to a party. this is not really well done. it feels like it pulls off comedic absurdity without trying to. it had its funny moments, but they weren't very well thought out throughout the movie. the acting was atrocious except for the dad.

the thing that really annoyed me about this film is the ending. youd excpect an ending sequence to have a, well, ending sequence. but it doesnt. its as if they filmed the entire movie and as a few literally last minute changes, they added the last minute of the film. yes, the ending is around 1 minute long. as a nonish spoiler, the last minute involves a prom. the thing is, the prom wasn't mentioned not once during the film, it just came out of nowhere and it was just so badly pulled off it was sad. i wouldnt watch this again and I wouldnt recommend it either.",1378080000,,1621,4.242718446601942

Though, she was being deceitful the entire time and blaming him for not trusting her. The entire movie was spent lying where she was at and making fake videos to show her dad. About 10 minutes maybe involved ""romance"". That was a few minutes in the beginning when she meets the guy, a few seconds in the middle when he calls her, and a few minutes at the end. The dialog was cheesy and the ""mean girls"" plot was ridiculous. Admittedly, the movie gets a little better as it progresses. The opening scenes were awful and I forced myself to watch further and it did get better. Though many of the actresses were ""over acting"". Many exaggerated movements and expressions...but I guess that's what you get with these types of movies nowadays. The best part was the battle of the bands scene. It has nothing to really do with the movie, and they never announce a winner (though it's apparently implied in the movie?, but I did laugh during that part.

She has a controlling Dad who has raised her as a single parent since the girl, Mandy, was four years old. He sees a camera shot of her being hugged by the cool guy, and flips out, grounding her in every area of her life. Meanwhile, Mr. Cool (""Drew"") invites her to the party of the year at his house in a gated community called Camelot. She goes through some amazing events trying to circumvent her father's grounding, and succeeds. During this drawn out sequence of events, the father gets an insight into his need to ""let go"" or relinquish his controlling ways, and that he has done the best he can do as a parent. Now, it's time to let her be the woman she has become. It's touching to see their reconciliation, especially if one is a teen or a parent struggling through those years and experiences. The movie is so sappy, that I was embarrassed to myself for allowing myself to be moved by the girl's efforts at independence, and the father's trying to be a responsible Dad and protect his daughter. Yet, in the last analysis it is a happy ending. She resists moral temptation; yet wins the affection of the cool dude anyhow. The father is satisfied.

The story was sold like a good teen movie: A teen nerdy girl who is invited to a party by most popular guy but she is grounded and she can not go..could she at last go?

I was waiting an intersting really really teen movie with funnier situations and bolder scenes (as in movies lie 1O THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU or CAN'T BUY ME LOVE) but when i finally was able to watch the finished film i was so dissapointed !

All the story is not soooo teeen, is more like a pre-teen movie that looks like ""made for disney channel"" with a very very slow monitoring and an immature story.
I have to say also that in the movie appear three popular girls, and all of them are an EXACT COPY of that popular girls who appears in the movie MEAN GIRLS but mixed with the most unfunny and bore situations. At least MEAN GIRLS is a very funny movie but this one is just crap !!

Yhe whole movie is bored, silly and very ""kiddy"", so..if you are expecting something like 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU or AMERICAN PIE this movie is really far, soooo far of that, this movie is more like a DISNEY CHANNEL ORIGINAL MOVIE with really bad history.",1284336000,2,1393,4.2293233082706765

3167534,3,B00175VSBW,"The only reason why I even wanted to see this movie is cause of Ashley Tisdale, being a big fan of her's, and frankly from the promos i had a feeling this movie would be good but i was wrong... the movie was outright boring, trying to bank on a rather cheesy plot, the movie tries to make a vague attempt at comedy frankly, i didn't find any of the scenes genuinely funny at all, it was more like a ""been there done(seen/heard) that"" kinda story. I certainly didn't like the way the movie started, felt it jump started instead of having a rather gradual beginning, maybe a little more scoop on Mandy's history or her life at school might have been better. The ""Video Phone"" was highlighted a bit too much honestly and one could even consider the movie being a commercial for the phone rather... my only favorite moment in the entire movie was when Ashley sang ""Shadows of the Night"", Ashley is well the only best thing bout the movie, she did a rather remarkable job looking like a nerd and pretty cute too... the supporting cast was good though a disappointing plot really overshadowed their performance, I'll admit though i like her better playing Sharpay or Maddie rather than Mandy, n even though she admitted being able to relate herself to the character very much she does better otherwise... Well this was her first movie as a leading lady n she definitely has a long long way to go... ill keep my eyes open for the day she really ""Bops to the Top""..",1275004800,,1457,4.46067415730337

The actors - again no acting to speak about.  No my review is not long - and that is because there is so little to say about the whole sorry mess.  Please save your money I would not even spend my money to rent it. Not only do I want my money back but I want the time I spent watching it back.

I know it's supposed to be ""fun,"" but the unrealisticness and the fast pace of the movie is a weak point. It gives off all the wrong messages (Lying is okay, you won't get caught, Revenge is okay) and whatnot. Not what I wanted when I was babysitting a family friend's four year old daughter.

It moves too fast, the situations are completely laughable. This movie seems to be written for three different age groups as well.

3167540,5,B00175VSBW,"I rented this movie expecting just another average teenage comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the actors/actresses played in the movie and lived up to the plot. The movie is basically about a girl named Mandy (Ashley Tisdale) who is not very popular in school and who is trying to date Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).

The plan is to attend a big party to which Drew invites her to, but unfortunately as luck would have it she is GROUNDED by her dad for breaking some rules. She later convinces him that she is only going to go to ""study"" with her 2 other friends, but he insists in a BIG BROTHER way that she must check in every 30 minutes via video cell phone on how everything is going. That is when the real fun starts and things start to get real crazy! Mandy must do crazy things every 30 mins to try and make her dad believe she is actually at her friends house studying. The scariest part of the movie was when she is driving and her dad asks her ""is that a horn I hear"" and insists on showing him what she is doing. She takes the keys out of the ignition on a busy road covers her eyes while her friends steer the car. I don't recommend this at home, and it almost getting all three of them killed by nearly hitting a truck head on.

There are a lot more crazy things Mandy does to try and fake where she is. You will have to watch the movie to see if her dad finds out what she and her friends did and bust her. I don't want to spoil the fun.

I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It is a funny as heck down to earth romantic comedy!",1228435200,8,1568,4.100977198697068

Yes, it's a tipical teen romance movie that isn't all that funny but I thought it was clever and had a refreshing cast.

As much as people hate this movie I [being 16 and female] throughly enjoyed it.

3167542,2,B00175VSBW,"Yet another teen comedy with the following content:

1. Over-protective parent
2. Unpopular girl with 2 friends
3. Popular girl with 2 friends (never one or three)
4. Hunk/Jock/Rich Guy
5. Party
6. Senior Prom
(You already know how it ends, don't you?)

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Mandy (Ashley Tisdale) has just turned eighteen
2. Her father (Kevin Pollack) is experiencing separation anxiety
3. He gets her a cool cell phone and contact lenses for her birthday, plus a plan for her future
4. Contact lenses immediately improve her looks (hair, make-up, posture, everything)
5. Video cell phone is actually for paranoid dad to track his little princess
6. Plan for the future could ruin hers
7. Out of the blue, Hunk/Jock/Rich Guy Drew (Robbie Amell) expresses an interest, much to the disgust of popular girl Lisa (Cindy Busby)
8. Typical shenanigans follow, except now it's high-tech thanks to the ever-present video cell phones
9. Suspend disbelief as Mandy overcomes all obstacles in order to disobey her father
10.  Typical ending follows

Due to the content I would say that this is for ages 13 - 17, but to be honest it doesn't have that much to offer in terms of comedy, life lessons or entertainment.  Wait for this on cable on a boring afternoon.

3167547,1,B00175VSBW,"This is a sad excuse for a movie.

First off I really wanted to like this movie, since his 'Life with Derek' fame I've had my crush on the cutie-patootie that is Robbie Amell, and heck sometimes Ashley Tisdale can be slightly above average in her so-called acting abilities. The idea seemed cute enough to work, the typical and some say overused idea of the unpopular girl finding her place in the sun alongside the man of her dreams and so on and so forth.

However this movie is a mix of 'She's all That' and 'Mean Girls' and not in a any of the good ways.

Since Ashley's one of the Disney Channel stars I figured this film would in suit be something suitable for a young girl of say 11(which is apparently the age that is stated on the box for the special features). Now I am twenty and therefore can't personally understand, but this film failed to find it's target audience. Instead of staying clean and cute for the young kids, or deciding to take a more hip and eye-opening approach for the late teens it is all mashed up in the middle with it's curse words, lack of all respect for parents, life threatening driving maneuvers, .. heck I could go on forever. Yet it never takes a serious or in that fact raunchy enough step to be popular with most older teens, especially in comparison to a 'Not Another Teen Movie' or 'Ten Things I Hate About You'.

And for a movie that claims to be for '11 years and older',  I'm not so sure the word orgasmic is completely suitable. Not to mention the footlong slit that her friend decided to cut into Mandy's dress to make her look presentable for the 'party of her dreams'.

Anyway, It's clear to see this movie was intended to be yet another launching pad for Tisdale, and not much more. How serendipitous that they could find a way to get her to sing in it too!",1219622400,5,1810,4.32448377581121

3401869,1,B00175VSBW,"Mandy Gilbert (Ashley Tisdale) is stuck in obscurity.  Not only is she geeky, but her father is a bit of an overprotective control freak and her cell phone is stuck in the dark ages.  She does have two good friends, but that's about it.

Since seventh grade, she has had a crush on Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).  And, the day before her eighteenth birthday, decides to do something about it.  Much to her surprise, it's not as hard as she thought it would be.  He even invites her to be his date at a party he is giving this weekend.

However, things take a turn for the worse when her dad (Kevin Pollak) grounds her for almost no reason.  She manages to get a reprieve, but only to study.  Now she must figure out a way to get an outfit and get to the party, all while fooling her dad with her new, flashy camera phone.  But as the situations get out of hand, can she pull it off?

From the brief preview I caught on ABC Family, I thought this made for TV movie might be fun.  I was wrong.  Instead of a relaxing hour and a half, I spent the entire time cringing as Mandy moved from one bad experience to another.  I did find a couple scenes amusing, but that was about it.  None of the characters were that sympathetic.  And the moral about parents learning to let go sends a bad message to the intended teen audience.  Despite the fact that the film debuted on ABC Family, I'd give it a strong PG-13 rating for content as well.

Those looking for a light movie will be disappointed.  Instead, it glorifies teen rebellion and vilifies parents.  Even though there were a couple clever scenes, I won't be watching again.",1216598400,2,1621,4.304635761589404

The movie stars Ashley Tisdale Mandy, as a nice and smart, middle social class girl who has a crush on the hot and rich guy in school, who by the way is also perfect and has won every single medal in every single sport. He is Prince Charming. He finally notices her and invites her to his party as his date. But, Mandy is grounded and, thanks to her new video phone (tons of product placement in this movie), her dad is keeping tabs on her every half hour. Mandy must race against the clock and get in all sorts of implausible situations to go to the party and fool her overbearing father that she is studying at a friend's house. Between ruined clothes, allergies, towed cars, and a battle of the bands, Mandy has her work cut out for her. But, still to top it all up, the evil rich and popular girl is out to get her.

The movie is funny because it has so many implausible situations that you just have to go with it. The movie also shows the influence of technology and media in the current culture. Nice use of gadgets. Now, I must get that phone (the true main character of this movie!).",1216252800,28,1457,4.824

But as far as teen rom-coms go, this movie is practically unwatchable. The acting is plain awful. The basic premise of the story is interesting enough but the filmmakers failed to deliver it in a convincing way.
Luckily I was able to fold laundry while this was on so it wasn't a total waste of my time.

I feared a seriously corny, poorly acted, fumbling, stupid, typical movie--and my fears were not realized while watching this movie!  It was not corny, poorly acted, fumbling, stupid, or typical (in that it would have been all those things).  The acting was actually pretty good--I feel like the ""mean"" girls' delivery/portrayal was the worst in the film (that's not to put them or their acting down, personally).  I feel like the movie wasn't typical in that Tisdale and her dad actually had a good relationship--she wasn't trying to go against him out of lack of respect.  Also, aside from being a little overbearing with his love, the dad didn't totally ignore the desires and words of his daughter, like in so many other movies.  I especially liked that Tisdale didn't change herself to be liked, and her friends were true friends, not people who were just ""yes"" men or ones who egged her on to give up who she truly was and do whatever, just for the sake of popularity.  Long story short, because I could be here all day writing about how this movie is atypical, despite its typical genre.  Oh, and I like that they didn't turn Tisdale's character into this total spaz, who turned into this non-spaz--she was just a normal girl, who didn't happen to be popular.

She litterally does everything she can to convince him, but it proves difficult with her way too advanced for 2008 video phone.

Of course you have to add in the ""I can't tell the truth, what would they think if they knew I had an allergy to nuts?""
  This movie is just icky sticky self centered, do it now or die forever, if we keep mentioning sex it will sell the movie, teenage mentality drama.
And I am not sure when a thong could ever be considered ""grannie panties"" even in a teenage movie.  And the fact that a boy can dump his girlfriend for you and that doesn't raise any reasonable red flags.  Getting an entire bar (How did they get into the bar?) to fall for your pitiful sob story and be absolutely quiet while you lie to your parent....it was too TV reality for me.

 It could be light hearted fun if you don't take the movie seriously.  (Which, I am sure,  is exactly how it is intended)
 Generally I like teenage drama movies.  I like the lighthearted and the desperation for social acceptance that attends the teenage drama.  But, in this movie there are too many innuendos.  The entire thing is to cliche, to stuck in the queen teen drama with a little slapstick.  Total non-reality consequences.  Which of course could be exactly what you are in the mood to watch or it could just grate horribly on the frontal lobes of your brain.

3401948,2,B00175VSBW,"I went into this movie not expecting much except for a common teen romcom. this movie is about a girl who has an overprotective dad who cant let go of his 18 year old daughter. the girl likes a hottest guy in school and when he finally notices her she is grounded for it(sorta). it features all the common things, the perfect guy, the evil girlfriend, the group of best friends, etc. it just fails at alot of what it tries to do.

the movie starts off with mandy narrating about the town being divided into the high class and the mid-low class. the film doesnt do much to develop on this. mandy often describes herself as low class and works at a pet shop for minimum wage, but her dad is an architect and she lives in a big fancy house. this movie is more about avoiding dad by using her video phone so she can get to a party. this is not really well done. it feels like it pulls off comedic absurdity without trying to. it had its funny moments, but they weren't very well thought out throughout the movie. the acting was atrocious except for the dad.

the thing that really annoyed me about this film is the ending. youd excpect an ending sequence to have a, well, ending sequence. but it doesnt. its as if they filmed the entire movie and as a few literally last minute changes, they added the last minute of the film. yes, the ending is around 1 minute long. as a nonish spoiler, the last minute involves a prom. the thing is, the prom wasn't mentioned not once during the film, it just came out of nowhere and it was just so badly pulled off it was sad. i wouldnt watch this again and I wouldnt recommend it either.",1378080000,,1621,4.242718446601942

Though, she was being deceitful the entire time and blaming him for not trusting her. The entire movie was spent lying where she was at and making fake videos to show her dad. About 10 minutes maybe involved ""romance"". That was a few minutes in the beginning when she meets the guy, a few seconds in the middle when he calls her, and a few minutes at the end. The dialog was cheesy and the ""mean girls"" plot was ridiculous. Admittedly, the movie gets a little better as it progresses. The opening scenes were awful and I forced myself to watch further and it did get better. Though many of the actresses were ""over acting"". Many exaggerated movements and expressions...but I guess that's what you get with these types of movies nowadays. The best part was the battle of the bands scene. It has nothing to really do with the movie, and they never announce a winner (though it's apparently implied in the movie?, but I did laugh during that part.

Studying with her friends and to a party with the hot guy. The dad is calling her every half hour while she is trying to get to the party. She has to show her dad on the phone that she is ""studying"" while trying to get to the party with all these crazy things getting in her way. The situations that she encounters and the schemes she comes up with makes you say, ""Yeah right!"" For example getting a whole crowed to go along with her scam. pu lease!

She has a controlling Dad who has raised her as a single parent since the girl, Mandy, was four years old. He sees a camera shot of her being hugged by the cool guy, and flips out, grounding her in every area of her life. Meanwhile, Mr. Cool (""Drew"") invites her to the party of the year at his house in a gated community called Camelot. She goes through some amazing events trying to circumvent her father's grounding, and succeeds. During this drawn out sequence of events, the father gets an insight into his need to ""let go"" or relinquish his controlling ways, and that he has done the best he can do as a parent. Now, it's time to let her be the woman she has become. It's touching to see their reconciliation, especially if one is a teen or a parent struggling through those years and experiences. The movie is so sappy, that I was embarrassed to myself for allowing myself to be moved by the girl's efforts at independence, and the father's trying to be a responsible Dad and protect his daughter. Yet, in the last analysis it is a happy ending. She resists moral temptation; yet wins the affection of the cool dude anyhow. The father is satisfied.

The story was sold like a good teen movie: A teen nerdy girl who is invited to a party by most popular guy but she is grounded and she can not go..could she at last go?

I was waiting an intersting really really teen movie with funnier situations and bolder scenes (as in movies lie 1O THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU or CAN'T BUY ME LOVE) but when i finally was able to watch the finished film i was so dissapointed !

All the story is not soooo teeen, is more like a pre-teen movie that looks like ""made for disney channel"" with a very very slow monitoring and an immature story.
I have to say also that in the movie appear three popular girls, and all of them are an EXACT COPY of that popular girls who appears in the movie MEAN GIRLS but mixed with the most unfunny and bore situations. At least MEAN GIRLS is a very funny movie but this one is just crap !!

Yhe whole movie is bored, silly and very ""kiddy"", so..if you are expecting something like 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU or AMERICAN PIE this movie is really far, soooo far of that, this movie is more like a DISNEY CHANNEL ORIGINAL MOVIE with really bad history.",1284336000,2,1393,4.2293233082706765

I certainly didn't like the way the movie started, felt it jump started instead of having a rather gradual beginning, maybe a little more scoop on Mandy's history or her life at school might have been better. The ""Video Phone"" was highlighted a bit too much honestly and one could even consider the movie being a commercial for the phone rather... my only favorite moment in the entire movie was when Ashley sang ""Shadows of the Night"", Ashley is well the only best thing bout the movie, she did a rather remarkable job looking like a nerd and pretty cute too... the supporting cast was good though a disappointing plot really overshadowed their performance, I'll admit though i like her better playing Sharpay or Maddie rather than Mandy, n even though she admitted being able to relate herself to the character very much she does better otherwise... Well this was her first movie as a leading lady n she definitely has a long long way to go... ill keep my eyes open for the day she really ""Bops to the Top""..",1275004800,,1457,4.46067415730337

The movie is basically about a girl named Mandy (Ashley Tisdale) who is not very popular in school and who is trying to date Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).

The plan is to attend a big party to which Drew invites her to, but unfortunately as luck would have it she is GROUNDED by her dad for breaking some rules. She later convinces him that she is only going to go to ""study"" with her 2 other friends, but he insists in a BIG BROTHER way that she must check in every 30 minutes via video cell phone on how everything is going. That is when the real fun starts and things start to get real crazy! Mandy must do crazy things every 30 mins to try and make her dad believe she is actually at her friends house studying. The scariest part of the movie was when she is driving and her dad asks her ""is that a horn I hear"" and insists on showing him what she is doing. She takes the keys out of the ignition on a busy road covers her eyes while her friends steer the car. I don't recommend this at home, and it almost getting all three of them killed by nearly hitting a truck head on.

There are a lot more crazy things Mandy does to try and fake where she is. You will have to watch the movie to see if her dad finds out what she and her friends did and bust her. I don't want to spoil the fun.

I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It is a funny as heck down to earth romantic comedy!",1228435200,8,1568,4.100977198697068

Yes, it's a tipical teen romance movie that isn't all that funny but I thought it was clever and had a refreshing cast.

3. Popular girl with 2 friends (never one or three)
4. Hunk/Jock/Rich Guy
5. Party
6. Senior Prom

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Mandy (Ashley Tisdale) has just turned eighteen
2. Her father (Kevin Pollack) is experiencing separation anxiety
3. He gets her a cool cell phone and contact lenses for her birthday, plus a plan for her future
4. Contact lenses immediately improve her looks (hair, make-up, posture, everything)
5. Video cell phone is actually for paranoid dad to track his little princess
6. Plan for the future could ruin hers
7. Out of the blue, Hunk/Jock/Rich Guy Drew (Robbie Amell) expresses an interest, much to the disgust of popular girl Lisa (Cindy Busby)
8. Typical shenanigans follow, except now it's high-tech thanks to the ever-present video cell phones
9. Suspend disbelief as Mandy overcomes all obstacles in order to disobey her father
10.  Typical ending follows

Due to the content I would say that this is for ages 13 - 17, but to be honest it doesn't have that much to offer in terms of comedy, life lessons or entertainment.  Wait for this on cable on a boring afternoon.

3402044,1,B00175VSBW,"This is a sad excuse for a movie.

First off I really wanted to like this movie, since his 'Life with Derek' fame I've had my crush on the cutie-patootie that is Robbie Amell, and heck sometimes Ashley Tisdale can be slightly above average in her so-called acting abilities. The idea seemed cute enough to work, the typical and some say overused idea of the unpopular girl finding her place in the sun alongside the man of her dreams and so on and so forth.

However this movie is a mix of 'She's all That' and 'Mean Girls' and not in a any of the good ways.

Since Ashley's one of the Disney Channel stars I figured this film would in suit be something suitable for a young girl of say 11(which is apparently the age that is stated on the box for the special features). Now I am twenty and therefore can't personally understand, but this film failed to find it's target audience. Instead of staying clean and cute for the young kids, or deciding to take a more hip and eye-opening approach for the late teens it is all mashed up in the middle with it's curse words, lack of all respect for parents, life threatening driving maneuvers, .. heck I could go on forever. Yet it never takes a serious or in that fact raunchy enough step to be popular with most older teens, especially in comparison to a 'Not Another Teen Movie' or 'Ten Things I Hate About You'.

And for a movie that claims to be for '11 years and older',  I'm not so sure the word orgasmic is completely suitable. Not to mention the footlong slit that her friend decided to cut into Mandy's dress to make her look presentable for the 'party of her dreams'.

Anyway, It's clear to see this movie was intended to be yet another launching pad for Tisdale, and not much more. How serendipitous that they could find a way to get her to sing in it too!",1219622400,5,1810,4.32448377581121
