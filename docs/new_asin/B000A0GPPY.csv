8071432,4,B000A0GPPY,"El Oficio Mas Antiguo Del Mundo(1970, The Oldest Business in the World) is a dark, niorish drama. A couple of prostitutes(Jaqueline Andere and the late Maricruz Olivier) living in a rural area find an injured man(Oscar Chavez)dying in an alley. They take the man back to the brothel and nurse him back to health. How are the brothel madam(Gloria Marin) and the rest of the ""women of the night"" going to react when they find out the injured man is a priest?!
 Aside from some minor flaws, EOMADM is a riveting classic of Mexican cinema. Enrico Caviatti and Nacho Mendez's Jazzy/Bossa Nova score is sparse, but it sounds really good! Director Luis Alcoriza jams as much sex appeal as he legally can into the film(Lina Marin's cleavage, Jackie Andere's legs, Heidi Blue's torso, etc.). The late Eduardo Lopez Rojas played a butler in the film; he appeared in Hollywood movies like My Family. We also get to see a young Lupita Ferrer before she appeared in soap operas like Rosalinda(1999). We also get to see Mexico as it looked in the early 1970's. The late Maricruz Olivier plays a cynical, sexy, intelligent hooker in the film. It's a pity that most people have forgotten about her or have never heard of her. EOMADM may have seemed decadent and perverse when it was unleashed in 1970, but it's pretty tame by today's shameless, anything goes standards. The only extra on this DVD is a chapter index, but at least one can own it for a low price.",1232236800,4,1445,4.64453125
