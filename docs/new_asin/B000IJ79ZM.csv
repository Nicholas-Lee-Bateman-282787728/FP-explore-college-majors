8145997,5,B000IJ79ZM,"I purchased this DVD for my newly pregnant daughter and she LOVED it.  The information in the DVD is presented by Dr. Andrea Pennington is a young, African American physician who happens to be pregnant!  She provides the perspective of both a medical doctor and a woman who is about to give birth for the first time.

My daughter and I both appreciated the focus on natural remedies and methods for addressing pregnancy related issues.  My daughter enjoyed the interviews with the various alternative health professionals and the information on natural birthing methods, stress reduction, and eco-friendly baby diapers.

I thought it was interesting how you follow her as her own pregnancy progresses.  Even though she is a medical doctor and gives great advice, she also freely expressed her own feelings as a mother-to-be. Don't miss the surprise ending in the Special Features section!

I also appreciated the excellent production quality.  This is a really happy and positive documentary and I highly recommend it!  I am so happy I found this and thank you Amazon for making it available:)",1359676800,,1093,5.06145251396648
