This movie is probably the best motocross video I have ever seen. Because, you don't just see him doing tricks and acting stupid, you actually see him and his life. However, the tricks that he performs are astonishing. This kid is an amazing rider. I have seen him doing freestyle tricks and racing in Las Vegas of this year. All I have to say is that if you like motocross, you have to get this or give it as a present. It's well worth it. 199 will live on forever!",1001894400,10,623,4.243697478991597
8280732,5,B00005JCCQ,"This video gives a great behind the helmet look in Pastrana's racing/freestyle career. It incorperates racing footage of Travis's first races back in his Loretta Lynn days, gnarley tricks, such as the recliner and the can-can, and an inside look at his family. This is a great video for avid racing fans or for the newcomers to the sport. It was put together very well with great music, awesome footage from Travis's life, and quite a few hilarious moments. I loved this video and I am sure you will too.",998179200,5,504,4.611111111111111
