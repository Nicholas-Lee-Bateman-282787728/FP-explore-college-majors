5087071,3,B007HOQ574,"This is an okay documdrama about a very important event, namely the hijacking by the Armed Islamic Group of an Air France airliner in Algiers on Christmas Eve,1994. The terrorists intended to crash the plane into the Eifel Tower, but were thwarted first by the Algerian and French authorities. The plane was stormed by the French GIGN counterterrorist unit on the ground in Marseilles. This was on in a series of terrorist attacks on the road to 9/11, so is important to understand the ongoing war on terror. The film is fairly faithful to the actual events. The edition of the French film is dubbed in English in such a way that it sounds like an old Godzilla movie. It just doesn't work and makes a fairly good film sound cheap and amateurish, which it is not. The action sequences at the end could have been better edited. The filmwork was good, but the editing is so choppy it is hard to follow what exactly is going on at a few points. I would recommend this to viewers interested in the phenomenon of terrorism, French history, and Algerian history.",1386288000,,1055,4.587301587301587
5087072,3,B007HOQ574,"This is an interesting, although partially flawed, film about a tragic terrorist attack and a spectacularly succesful anti-terrorist operation. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The real story.

On 24 December 1994, at Houari Boumedienne Airport of Algiers in Algeria, four armed men dressed and acting as Algerian presidential police boarded Air France Flight 8969 bound to depart for Orly Airport of Paris, France. Moments after they dropped the act and took the control of the plane, revealing that they were not police, but ""mujahideen"" of Groupe Islamic Arm (GIA), the most radical of Muslim extremists guerillas waging in those times jihad against Algerian regime in order to establish an ""islamic state"" in Algeria.

The leader of hijackers, Abdul Abdullah Yahia, initially requested that inprisoned Algerian islamist leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, are released. When that was rejected, he requested that the plane is allowed to take off and fly to Paris. When Algerian authorities refused, the terrorists murdered successively three passengers: an Algerian policeman, a Vietnamese diplomat and finally a young French man, Yannick Beugnet, who worked as cook for the French embassy in Algiers. After this third murder, acting on request of French authorities, Algerian government agreed to let the plane take off - but with only enough fuel to make it to Marseille...

Once arrived to Marseille, the hijackers asked for the re-fueling in order to continue towards Paris - but after long negotiations what they got instead was the attack by French elite anti-terrorist unit, the Groupement d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN). French government in the meantime correctly guessed that if the hijackers insisted so much on flying to Paris, it was in order to crash the plane on the city, most probably on some particularly prestigious target...

The attack by GIGN was a great success. All terrorists were killed. Nine GIGN commandos were wounded - two of them very badly. Also thirteen hostages were wounded, including one seriously - but all wounded commandos and civilians eventually recovered. The GIA didn't try anymore hijackings of French planes - instead, it launched in 1995 a campaign of bombing terrorist attacks in Paris, which lasted until the capture or death of all terrorists involved in them.

2. The film.

First, let's stress that this is a French film, so it suffers from some peculiarities typical in modern French cinema: it is veeery sloooooow, everybody seems terminally depressed, there is no humour, people always speak in the same monotonous way no matter what just happens on the screen, nobody seems to really believe in what he/she is doing because everything is anyway ""de la merde"", etc, etc.

Also, the director decided to use a technical trick - the colours are toned down on purpose. It is not exactly a black and white film, but most if it is kind of... greyish. It is certainly artistically interesting, and with time it is possible to get used to it, but initially it is realy annoying.

But the most annoying and completely unnecessary thing is the character of Carole Jeanton, a staff member of one of the ministries involved in the management of this crisis, who somehow is the only who actually knows what is happening and must of course struggle with all her completely incompetent superiors to convince them that the terrorists want actually to crash their plane on Paris. As far as I know the real story, such a character never existed and the security specialists in charge of the file, beginning with the Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua himself, did a PERFECT JOB during this crisis - so why the heck change the story and take a dump on them!? ""All people in charche are incompetent so the little guy/gal who knows everything must force them to do what he/she knows to be the right thing"" - this is such a STUPID and unnecessary clich!

Some thing about planning the assault and also some details of the real attack clearly COULDN'T be divulged to the public and I totally understand that, but what I really would like to see in this kind of films is at least one meeting of the crisis management team and also how the different cogs and wheels in state machinery start moving once a really bad crisis begins - but you will not see it here. Instead you will have Carole Jeanton knowing everything from the beginning and then instructing her obvioulsy stoooopid bosses about what must be done - and that is it. understand

On another hand all the scenes on board of the hijacked plane are EXCELLENT! That aspect of the film is a great success. The final assault is very well filmed, extremely dramatic and seems very realistic. Actors were all unknown to me, but they did a good job, especially those who played the terrorists and Thierry Prungnaud, the leader and point-man of the first assault team.

Bottom line, this is a honest watch, which could have been much better, but still, it is worth seeing, for many reasons not the least of which is the heartening message - if only the good guys make a honest effort, the evil people are certain to be defeated. And that is an encouraging thought...",1385337600,,5205,4.9157175398633255
5087073,4,B007HOQ574,"This Assault tells the story of the 1994 Hijacking of Air France Fight 8969 with on lot of focus placed on the GIGN; the elite French counter-terrorist unit. The movie is fast paced and has some cool action but it might have been better if they'd toned down the shaky-cam a bit. My only real gripe however, was the slightly one-sided portrayal of the terrorists. All in all, if you like movies like Executive Decision, 44 Minutes or Zero Dark Thirty then you'll probably like this.",1375056000,,481,4.604651162790698
5087074,4,B007HOQ574,"This is the story on how France in 1994 was able to avoid their ""9-11"" tragedy. Unfortunately the lessons learned from this incident didn't prevent our 9-11 as some critics have claimed it should have done.  This story is told from 3 points of view. One is from the action on the plane itself in the runway in Algeria. The second is told from the story of Thierry (Vincent Elbaz) the French GIG (SWAT team) leader. The third and most important is the story of Carole (Mlanie Bernier) an assistant in the foreign minister's office. She was the one who realized this was really a suicide mission and there was no negotiating with the GIA terrorist group. She oversteps her authority and steps on a few toes in order to prevent a take off. I believe her role was a bit of a dramatization, but it made the film watchable as we end up with a woman, who is given no credit, saving Paris from burning.

The story was good paced drama-thriller. The voice overs were no better than 1960 Italian film voice overs and has been an on going problem for every French film I have seen in the past few year. I know there are people who can do better voice overs.

5087075,5,B007HOQ574,"I enjoyed the movie and am happy I purchased it.  The only downside is that the movie has voice-overs in English that detract from the movie as a whole.  Whether the character is French, Algerian, etc., they all have American sounding voices and the sound quality with the voice-overs is not what it should have been.  If more care had been taken in putting an appropriate voice with each character, it would have made for much better viewing.  Fortunately, in the set up section of the Main Menu you can play it using the French soundtrack with English subtitles.  I want to thank the first reviewer of this film for cluing me in to that fact.  I was so excited to watch the movie when I got it that I just popped it in my DVD player and started watching it.  Watching it in French was much better.

That being said, I thought every aspect of the assault phase of the movie was incredibly filmed and is very intense.  The attention given to events leading up to the assault was well done without belaboring it.  These scenes let the viewer know what is going on in a concise manner and then the movie moves on.

Overall a very good movie and I highly recommend it.",1339977600,7,1165,4.372093023255814
5087076,5,B007HOQ574,"Even if you didn't have any knowledge that the events depicted in the film ""the Assault"" were real, I think you could appreciate this movie as a very well-made action story.  But the thing is...it really did happen the way the film showed it (albeit I'm sure with slight fictionalization to compress the story which unfolded over several days in an action packed 90 minutes).  Islamic terrorists hijacked a French airliner in 1994 in Algeria, murdered three hostages, and threatened to kill the rest if their demands were not met.  And French intelligence agencies came to the sickening conclusion that the terrorists didn't plan to bargain for the release of prisoners or for a ransom.  Rather they planned to fly the fully fueled jetliner into Paris and crash it into the Eiffel Tower (an eerie foreshadowing of 9/11).  Were it not for the elite French police commando unit storming the aircraft in Marseilles, there could have been a far, far worse tragedy.

<spoilers...although given this is a historical event, giving this warning is a bit silly>

The thing that is truly amazing about this incident is that despite the fact that the French commandos were forced to make what amounted to a frontal assault on the airliner which contained four heavily armed terrorists (with pistols, grenades, and automatic weapons) and which was jammed with over 170 passengers and crew, none of the French police or hostages died.  Some of the commandos were badly hurt but despite a prolonged gun battle in a confined space full of people, only the four terrorists were killed.

That in my opinion, places this incident in the same league as the daring Israeli rescue operation at Entebbe. The Israelis were at greater risk during that operation because they were in hostile territory in Uganda but they enjoyed the element of surprise and shooting that took place did not take place in a crowded airliner.  So this French accomplishment is something to remember the next time some comedian trots out tired jokes about French lack of valor and military incompetence.

<end unnecessary spoiler warning>

The film was made with cooperation of the French authorities and has a great deal of authenticity as a result.  The performances by the cast are excellent...especially those of the hijackers.  The scene that sticks in my mind the most apart from the nail-biting gunfight at the end is the scene where the Algerian authorities bring the mother of the leader of the terrorists to try to get him to abandon his mad plan.  That really did happen and my heart goes out to his mother.

The film is not perfect.  Too much time is spent showing one of the police commandos' wives worrying about her husband (who was badly wounded in the incident).  I  suppose they did that to humanize the police but I can't help but think it was a bit cliched.  But that's a minor gripe.

Another thing I would urge people not to do is watch it with the English language dubbing but keep with the French language soundtrack and English subtitles (the dubbing automatically makes the movie come across as fake and that's the last thing it is).

Bottom line: This is a great movie about an event that was at turns horrific and heroic.",1339545600,15,3204,4.8083941605839415
