8226716,5,B000X25FTQ,"This dvd contains 3 videos previously sold seperately. The first part of the dvd contains the life and times of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska. It tells of her life, and mission bringing the viewer directly to the locations where this Beloved Saint spent her days. From her small cottage where she was born, to the various convents she was assigned to. It is very well produced, and takes the viewer along the paths of St. Faustina's steps. The first video is about an hour in length.

The second video is a video form of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. It shows images of the Congregation in which St. Faustina prayed, and meditated, Pictures of Our Merciful Lord Jesus, and other Holy images while the Chaplet of Divine Mercy is played. This is a great video for those who are deeply devoted to St. Faustina and wish to recite the Chaplet with the help of Divine Mercy images.
This second video is about 30-35 minutes.

The third and final video in this special dvd contains the Beatification of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska. It was filmed on St. Peters Square in Rome, in front of thousands of souls. It shows Pope John Paul II announcing the great works of Divine Mercy and Saint Faustina. This video also shows behind the scenes footage of her congregation. The viewer is also treated to two accounts of Saintly intercession from Sister Faustina (leading to the Holy See to look into the beatification process). This third video is about 40-45 minutes.

These 3 videos (on one dvd) is a great gift for anyone who is deeply devoted to Saint Faustina, and the Divine Mercy. These videos used to sell seperately but are now together in one package, on one dvd.",1267488000,14,1659,4.636054421768708
