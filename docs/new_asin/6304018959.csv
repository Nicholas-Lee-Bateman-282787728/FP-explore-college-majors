767946,5,6304018959,"This 5-hour marathon was originally a mini-series on Danish television, which partly explains the length. It won't take you long to get completely involved in the weird goings-on at the massive Copenhagen hospital complex  named ""The Kingdom"", though, and once you're hooked, you'll want  to savor every minute. The primary plot concerns a malingering woman's  search within the hospital for the spirit of a young girl, but there's also  a phantom ambulance, a secret society (complete with some really bizarre  initiation rites!), a Greek Chorus doing the dishes, and at least a  half-dozen sub-plots. Although there are some visually disturbing scenes,  plus a few steamy ones, the overall tone is best summed up as ""quirky  humor"". The vast impersonality of the hospital is conveyed through  washed-out sepia-tinted shots of endless corridors and fly-over shots of  the huge complex, but the halls are chock-full of nuts. The Swedish chief  neurosurgeon, on the lam from Stockholm thanks to assorted misdeeds there,  shouts his frustrations at the ""Danish scum"" from the rooftops. A  resident takes *his* title quite literally, setting up living quarters in  the basement, where he recycles pharmaceuticals and keeps tabs on who's up  to what. A portly orderly, cowed into submission by his psychosomatic  mother, wheels her throughout the building while she searches for the  spirit of a young girl she believes was murdered. The loopy head of staff  seeks to inspire the workers with a typically management-brain-dead scheme  he proudly calls ""Operation Morning Wind"". If you like the movies  of the Coen brothers (""Fargo"", or ""The Hudsucker  Proxy"") or if you enjoyed ""Twin Peaks"", this is *definitely*  one to check out. And since this isn't enough in itself, yup, there's a  five-hour *sequel*!",914198400,24,1802,5.267605633802817
768090,5,6304018959,"Back in 1994, Lars von Trier offered to Danish television his first TV series, the Kingdom (Riget). A four episode per season saga that gave Lars his first popular success with the public. Set over three weeks, this first season of the Kingdom (Riget in Danish) is the story of the Neurosurgical department in RigHospitalet, an important hospital that really exists in Copenhagen.

Though all characters are fictitious, each one is a wonderful opportunity for us to uncover the reality, neuroses, and obsessions in the hospital business. Behaviours that one could recognize whether in Denmark, United Kingdom, United States, France, Canada, or anywhere else. Indeed, Lars and his collaborators even mentioned that they inspired themselves off of real incidents, adding a closer seriousness to the stories and the characters.
Among the most important are Stig Helmer, a Swedish consultant who's under an important medical investigation due to an unethical operation he did on Mona, a twelve year old. Mrs. Drusse, an hypochondriac medium who investigates paranormal activities in the hospital. Hook, a junior employee at war with Stig and in love with Judith, another doctor at the hospital. Moosegard, the naive and innocent manager of the Neurosurgical department. AND the dishwasher employees working in the basement, aware of what is going on in the hospital, of what others do not know about the hospital's secrets, and what may occur to the department's employees.

More than twelve characters share the spotlight in this mini series that was supposed to be of three parts. Two of them already completed, the third one written, but never shot because some of the actors died after the second season. Which is too bad. So the Kingdom remains incomplete, unless Lars would decide to recast his actors, or to put his story in another medium like video games or comic books. After all if David Lynch and Mark Frost are returning to Twin Peaks twenty-five years after the last episode, maybe Lars could do it too. Who knows!

So why watch the Kingdom?

Well, first for the storytelling. We have a medical drama set as a soap opera, but diving into layers like comedy, ghosts stories, politics, and voodoo. A melting pot of different storytelling genres always set in a same location, the Hospital.

Two, the visuals. The Kingdom is filmed in a claustrophobic style. Hand-held cameras focusing on the actors and editing involving jump cuts and grainy camera effects, the series gives us the feeling we're watching a documentary, although certain fixed shots or detailed camera movements do occur to break that illusion. Shots involving special effects or terrifying camera movements. Although some green screen effects may pale in comparison to what Lars did with breaking the Waves, Antichrist and Melancholia, the effects work in favour of the show, reinforcing the surrealism in the episodes.

Three, the acting. This series offers actors performing in a natural and realistic manner, everything enhanced with the camera cuts and continuity effects. Making you feel that they are real individuals whose lives we are witnessing over one hour episodes. Though we may not be aware of everything that they are doing. As such, everyone gives an excellent performance. Especially the ghost in this season, whose name I will not reveal, but who had important scenes in the fourth episode, where she gives a very moving one with another spirit.

Four, Lars von Trier. Since his career started in 1984, his name stands out among today's directors. From Element of Crime till Nymphomaniac and his upcoming series the House that Jack built, Lars has shaken the cinema art form with movies that have either infuriated or impressed viewers. All reacting in ways that reveal about those viewers either their true nature, their personal hypocrisies, or their perceptions of the world and of themselves. Of their neuroses and demons. From the Kingdom, then with his breakthrough masterpiece Breaking the Waves till Nymphomaniac, Lars gives Bovarist stories where, through the female heroines of his stories, he has revealed his own fears and anxieties, but also gave more opportunity to his actors. An actor director's work where many actors offered astonishing performances that have given international recognition. Like Emily Watson, Stellan Skarsgard, and Katrin Cartlidge for Breaking the Waves, Bjork for Dancer in the Dark, and Charlotte Gainsbourg since Antichrist till Nymphomaniac.

As such, this series is one of the best entries into the world of Lars von Trier. And one awesome TV series to watch and rewatch.",1414108800,2,4608,5.175838926174497

To his credit, Lars seems upfront about the whole thing: the tell happens in the titles when, during the ponderous theme music, the lyrics simply run out and the singers are left to laboriously chuff out the bland 4/4 chant ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 KINGDOM!!!"".

My only caveat would be that Lars von Trier intended to have a third part and was unable to do this, due to the (real-life) deaths of two of the lead actors.  So, you sort of have to enjoy what you get, and keep in mind that you don't really get a solid ending.

-Trademark cinematography - grainy and sepia Handycam effects
-Incomplete - this ends after 2 of what should have been 3 or 4 series

The last point sounds off-putting, but I haven't met anyone who hasn't thoroughly enjoyed this. When this was filmed, Lars von Trier was famous only in his native Denmark.

768172,5,6304018959,"WOW?!
 Hey,I taped the whole entire series on vhs,when it originally aired on ifc,in the mid 90's. The whole entire series seemed to get on one tape,as far as I can remember? I state it that way,because I stupidly let a partner ""borrow"" my copy,even before I finished viewing it,believing that he'd safely return it? But of course he didn't,leaving me to wonder if I'd ever see it's kind again,argh/urgh?!

And as well as all import afficianados know,if you sleep on something,you might not get another chance at it,that's just the way that it goes,unfortunately? So for years,I wondered if I'd even hear of it being bandied about,yet nothing came to light. It got to the point where I couldn't even remember the title,as the original moniker was something dutch(and I really couldn't recall that one,not at all)?!

Then when Stepehen King's version came out(which pales in comparison to the original),I thought that the industry would release the Lars Von Trier version,but no dice,aw? I just happened to accidentally run by it on amazon,as I was just surfing around,and BOOM!,there it was,whoa? When it first came out,it was years before the ultra fast internet superhighway,so if you didn't tape it/have an international mail order connection(which would be criminally expensive),you weren't gonna come by it,not at all?!

As an educational tool/search engine,the internet rocks(as well as amazon,cheers you lot)?! But you won't find me playing games,or looking at people humiliate themselves online,just for the hell of it(I'll watch the news for those little tidbits of eduatainment)?

768173,4,6304018959,"Let me start off by saying, I read another  review that mentions a glitch on the DVD, and I don't think I experienced anything like that. I just now finished disc 2 with no problems whatsoever, and the ""hiccup"" I had on disc one (when played on my playstation 2) did not repeat itself when played on my laptop.

The special effects are... ah... lacking, but over all, it's creative. We must keep in mind, this was released in 1994, so the visual effects we are used to now did not exist when this was filmed - on top of that, it was probably very low budget.

The plot moves very slowly at first, but still held my attention all the way through. Actually, it seems like each of the 4 episodes moves slowly at their beginnings, and then speed up at the end. Without me even realizing it, the suspense was building enough to make me jump at parts.

I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys foreign films. (The acting seems to be really good, although it's hard to tell sometimes when you can't ACTUALLY understand what anyone is saying.) If you hate reading subtitles, then obviously this collection is not for you.

Apparently, Stephen King based his ""Kingdom Hospital"" off of this collection, and if it's good enough for King, it's good enough for me.
Can't wait to get my hands on Volume Two.

If you do buy this collection, make sure you stick it out 'till the end. This isn't an action movie or a slasher flick. You actually have to pay attention and finish it, or you'll get nothing out of it.

Aside from that, enjoy!",1223510400,2,1532,4.430604982206406
768174,5,6304018959,"This set contains the first two seasons of ""The Kingdom"". Lars Von Triers made ""The Kingdom"" with the intention that it would be a trilogy of mini-series, but unfortunately, after the second season, both Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), that is, the two main actors, died, putting a stop to Season Three (and to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't like to see a season without these actors). As a result of this, few of the story lines introduced in Season 1 are resolved in Season 2, and the ending comprises a number of cliff-hangers that Von Triers, presumably, intended to resolve in Season 3. Having said that, ""The Kingdom"" is an excellent series, and is one of the best TV series that I have ever seen.

""The Kingdom"" is set in Denmark's top hospital, which is run by a group of arrogant doctors, who operate a secret society from the hospital's basement, and is haunted by an assortment of ghosts. Season one of ""The Kingdom"", which was later remade for American television as ""Kingdom Hospital"", centres around Mrs. Drusse (a Miss Marple-like old lady) and her quest to put to rest the ghost of a young girl who died at The Kingdom many years earlier. Sub-plots include Prof. Bondo's quest to obtain a rare sarcoma; a bizarre pregnancy; and Dr. Helmer's (possibly the most arrogant doctor to ever appear on television) attempts to avoid a malpractice lawsuit.

Season 2 starts off immediately following the end of Season 1. Highlights of this series include Dr. Hook turning into a patient-hating psychopath after a rather unpleasant incident (I found Hook to be smug and self-righteous in Season 1, so really enjoyed this change of character); the revelation of Aage Kruger's true nature; ambulance racing; and a greater presence of Bulder (a hospital orderly) and Mogge (a medical student). There is also a greater focus on the occult in this season, and I found this season to be both sillier and scarier than the previous season.

In my opinion Season 1 is the better of the two seasons, I found the first two episodes of Season 2 to be a bit tedious (I didn't like the sub-plot about Prof. Moesgaard seeking psychiatric help or the one about Judith and her baby, at all). However, the final two episodes more than make up for them, and by the end, I really did want to see more.

 Fans of series such as ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Kingdom Hospital"" will definitely enjoy ""The Kingdom"", but don't go in expecting a satisfactory conclusion or you'll be disappointed.",1207353600,43,2500,4.764434180138569
768175,5,6304018959,"After seeing ""Kingdom Hospital"", which I thoroughly enjoyed at the time, I decided to watch the original Danish mini-series upon which it was based, although I couldn't imagine the original being any better than the remake. Boy, was I wrong. ""The Kingdom"", set in a Danish hospital that is haunted by the ghost of a dead child and populated by doctors and patients who are a little unusual, to say the least, is now one of my favourite series of all time and I cringe to think that I ever thought the American version was good. Everything about the Danish version is better than the original (with the possible exception of the anteater - he was added in the American version and doesn't appear in the Danish ""Kingdom"". I really loved that anteater): the actors are better (especially Ernst-Hugo Jaregard as the Dane-hating, arrogant Dr. Helmer), the scripts are better written, and there are some fantastic sub-plots that were discarded when the remake was made (it is beyond me why the sub-plot about Helmer travelling to Haiti to obtain a poison that will turn his colleagues into zombies was discarded and yet snooze-worthy stories about butter-fingered baseball players and a Jesus-like social worker were added in). In addition, because of the shorter running time (a little over four hours), ""The Kingdom"" moves a lot faster than ""Kingdom Hospital"" and has a lot less unnecessary filler.

""The Kingdom"" was originally intended to be the first of three mini-series, so ends with a cliff-hanger. The second mini-series was made (and is available on DVD as ""The Kingdom Series 2""), but unfortunately both Ernst-Hugo Jaregard and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse) died prior to the making of the third series and the project was shelved indefinitely. As a result, like ""Twin Peaks"", a series to which this is often compared, it looks as though we will never get to find out just what happens in the end of this wonderful series.",1206316800,6,1927,4.892966360856269
768176,4,6304018959,"Twisted and Fun! ... and a little sick..., January 24, 2008
By  Ms. Patricia J. Adams ""Piaget Moviebuff"" (California) - See all my reviews

I just finished both Series 1 and Series 2 of The Kingdom or RIGET in Danish, or was it Swedish? I am now nursing the huge headache I've obtained from battling to read the sub-titles and trying to watch at the same time... very difficult at times. This series, if you do not know already, is the series which inspired the Stephen King U.S. version from a couple of years ago called Kingdom Hospital. And much of the story is the same, with mostly the same characters. However, do not expect the same character to behave the same way in both versions. There are enough variations in the plot to make each shine on its own. A few additional notes of warning... this series 2 is NOT the conclusion of the story, even though this is the claim on the packaging. Also, this version, as one might expect, being from europe, is more risque' than american viewers are used to. I've seen more sex and gore in motion pictures, but not very much more. Additionally, there are some serious visual and scripted references to demons and satanism present in the european version. I would suggest that the viewer arm themselves for a psychic nightmare/roller coaster ride should you decide to purchase this series. If these elements frighten you too much, perhaps you should stick to the american version, Kingdom Hospital.",1201132800,,1446,4.688976377952756

768291,4,6304018959,"""Kingdom"" is rather strange whether we talk about the composition of the whole TV show, about its pacing, about style or about feelings it invokes. And that may be the obvious thing for I personally can't boast of having seen a huge amount of Danish pictures. But once you get into it, into ""Kingdom's"" atmosphere and rhythm, you start to like it. And as far as the story itself isn't new at all (story about haunted places, and about the living ones solving the violent nature of someone's mysterious death and helping the ghost rest in peace), it's not about ""what"", it's about ""how"". I'd say ""Kingdom"" is made in an unusual way, it's pretty unconventional thriller. I'm not even sure I can call it a thriller or a horror movie - it's more of a mystical drama. With lots of laugh of course - just recall the last minutes of it, when a health minister arrives at the hospital! What makes ""Kingdom"" outstanding is that its creators didn't concentrate only on horrors and thrills (because you might get such an impression reading different reviews and synopsises), but they put a lot of effort into human relations, into everyday's life of this immense hospital. Sometimes I got a feeling I was more interested in daily doctors' routine than in that mystical concept. The story-line has many subplots which are very interesting to follow. Certainly people from Denmark will see more in it than all the others, because we have to be familiar with Scandinavian realia to fully understand and appreciate the series, but nevertheless ""Kingdom"" still looks great.

The DVD edition itself has a couple of mishaps, the transfer is not great at all, it's rather grainy, and sometimes when the screen is dark it's practically indistinct. On the other hand Lars von Trier says in commentary it was partly intentional. Well, it's actually a dark (not literally) film, and this slipshod release fits it very well as it seemed to me. Don't be too hard on it.

I think you'll like ""Kingdom"" although it's different and not what you used to watch usually (I presume).",1138233600,4,2051,4.758426966292135
768292,2,6304018959,"I agree that this is a brilliant series filled with black humor, pathos, social satire and horror. Set in and actually filmed at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet, it is essentially a ghost story, a haunting, but told in a quirky, refreshing way. One can see why it attracted Stephen King and inspired him to write his subsequent novel ""Kingdom Hospital."" It certainly deserves all the 5 stars it gets at this site.

However there is a problem with the DVD edition issued by Koch/Lorber. On Disc Two, Episode 3, during the scene where Helmer enters the Central Archive after Mogge, the picture suddenly skips (at just after 39mins) to a part of the movie that is actually from Episode 1 on Disc One (the scene where Helmer's nose is being patched up). This sequence from the previous Disc then goes on for about 2 minutes before you suddenly switch back to the current episode but several minutes later with Dr Mogge already out of the Central Archive and running for his life. You are left wondering what happened in between.

This is not a problem with an individual disc. Replacing the disc makes no difference because they all have the same flaw. It is a production issue. It probably occured during the video-editing or mastering process. How this could have been passed for release is beyond me. I know Fox Lorber's previous reputation for producing shoddy DVDs but after the name change and several fairly good early releases under the Koch/Lorber label, I actually believed they had reformed. Alas not. This kind of sloppiness is wholly unacceptable. Koch/Lorber goes into the same black book as its disgraceful predecessor. If it had any conscience, Koch/Lorber would order a recall and replacement. But with this company's reputation, it's hardly likely.

I have the Asian version that has the whole 4.5-hour story on one disk, but the subtitles are often horribly miswritten, and one transition 3 hours into the show skips over 25 minutes (you have to figure out you're missing something, then rewind to get the missing portion).

Anyway, the review is for the show itself, rather than the existing disk product.  I'm just glad I was able to see it at all.  Visually, it reminds you of St. Elsewhere or Hill Street Blues.  But the content is occult/horror-comedy.  A lot of it really creeps up on you.  Brilliant characters:  Dr. Helmer is one of the most perversely and laughably despicable people I've ever seen on TV.

768296,5,6304018959,"I loved this (parts one and two).  It is at once; creepy, haunting, deeply disturbing and, not least, hysterically funny.  Lars von Trier is one of those directors whose work I will always see, regardless of whether the critics or the public have approved, because I know there will always be moments of pure genius which I will not want to miss, whether or not the whole adds up to brilliance (the other two are Almodovar and Egoyan).  I long for this on DVD.

Don't even get me started about ""Steven King's The Kingdom"" - Steven King?  How is it ""his""?  He's the Andrew Lloyd Weber of mass market horror, that one.

And, finally, why put down ""Six Feet Under"" in order to praise ""The Kingdom""?  That hurt.",1106956800,5,707,4.46875
768371,5,6304018959,"The Kingdom is the name of a gargantuan decaying hosital in Copenhagen where this amazing Lars von Trier Gothic television miniseries is set. of course, the title also refers to the kingdom of Denmark (in the staff meeting room where many scenes take place, the portraits of Queen Margrethe and her consort are prominently displayed), for which the hospital is a metaphor, and for the kingdom of society in general. And, as von Trier explains in his charming afterwords to the episodes, it also refers to the kingdom of the imagination itself.
The miniseries works on all these levels. It's a quirky, incredibly atmospheric study of the hospital centering upon the discovery of the ghost of a girl murdered 75 years previously on the same site haunting the hospital, and it revolves around a giant cast of dozens of memorable characters, all of whom are intensely sympathetic even though they're pretty miserable human beings. The three at the core of the story are a malingerer, the septuagenarian medium Mrs. Drusse, obsessed with discovering the story behind a ghost; a blackmailer, the young and sexy Dr. Hook; and his nemesis in the neurology department, the jaw-droppingly arrogant brain surgeon Dr. Helmer, who had to take this job in Denmark (which he loathes) after being cast out of a job in his native Sweden under suspicion of plagiarism. Although the Gothic aspects to the story are beautifully brought out by the labyrinthine deserted basement hallways of the hospital and Von Trier's gorgeous sepia-tinted cinemtography, like all the best ghost stories the ghosts here serve as metaphors for what's wrong with the state of society in general. The miniseries is an amazingly funny satire on the dilapidated Danish health care system, and the film's funniest moments involve the attempts of the neurology department's manager, the marvelously manipulative and passive-aggressive Professor Moesgaard, to implement a hilariously inane PR campaign called ""Operation Morning Air"" that involves (among other things) having the neurosurgeons cheerfully sing introductions to one another at staff meetings.
The series has often been compared to ""Twin Peaks,"" but it's probably even better. Like the Lynch series it does a marvelous job of conveying atmosphere, but it is deeper and more carefully engineered and imagined. Though there are moments that sag (including the disastrous idea of having Dr. Helmer visit Haiti near the end, which jarringly breaks the miniseries' adherence otherwise to the Aristotelean unities by and large), as a whole it is a genuine masterpiece. It is one of the richest works for television ever made.",1074297600,40,2638,5.224056603773585

I can't imagine anyone taking his place, he was sooo good. I also caught Kingdom II on IFC, don't understand why they can get it and we can't. This series would be even more wonderful on dvd!",1032393600,3,477,4.558139534883721
768374,5,6304018959,"Lars von Trier is a director who is incredibly keen on taking extreme left-hand turns in terms of his filmmaking. Before ""The Kingdom"" was first aired in 1994 to rave reviews and amazing success in its native Denmark, as well as achieving cult supremacy the world over (anyone who's seen the follow-up series is officially in my good books!), Trier had made ""The Element Of Crime"", ""Epidemic"" and ""Europa"" (or ""Zentropa"", the name of his production company), which his producer / friend Vibeke Windelov has described as ""intellectual and cold"". Then he came to prominence in anglophone territories with his affecting, emotionally involving/manipulative (which do you prefer?) 'Golden Heart Trilogy'; ""Breaking The Waves"", ""The Idiots"" and ""Dancer In The Dark"". ""The Kingdom"", however, is a true original in the Trier filmography, mixing the typical blacker-than-oblivion humour of Trier with an effectively spooky ghost story that has to be seen to be believed.
Trier's humour can be felt within the whole spiritualism-versus-modern medicine spectrum on which the many characters of the show populate, as highlighted in the hilarious Ernst-Hugo Jaregard as Stig Helmer's ongoing conflict with Kirsten Rolffes' Mrs Drusse, who passes her time either patrolling the immense hospital for ghosts or leading seances with her fellow patients. In essence, Helmer is the comedy character of the show, whether he's sternly lecturing his girlfriend about the follies of voodoo or staring open-mouthed at the full-blown inanity of the ""Operation Morning Air"" logo. It's a credit to the phenomenal Jaregard that, whether he's taking credit for other doctors' discoveries, bungling operations, screaming at the skies and treating his girlfriend like scum, Helmer remains a wonderful comic monster (think Pauline the Restart Officer from ""The League of Gentlemen"" TV show with grey hair and without the balloon-size pink lips).
The horror element of the show can be attributed to the often-unmentioned Morten Arnfred, who co-wrote and co-directed this behemoth alongside Trier. Stripped of Trier's acute comedy, ""The Kingdom"" would easily hold its own as a significant spookshow, albeit a traditional one given some fresh twists. Amid several nods to Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"", Arnfred and Trier handle the scares with an assured hand and some low-key special effects, and are aided substantially by Rolffes as the fiercely dedicated 'ghostbuster'; no way would Hollywood have a 70-year old heroine at the forefront of a horror film, but Rolffes cuts a stern, likeable rug throughout, whether she's interviewing her possessed fellow-patients or getting drenched in icky ectoplasm. And, mindful at the massive duration, Arnfred and Trier have devised the creepiest Greek chorus for some time in the two retarded dishwashers. Not only that, but they have an effective ghost in the figure of Annevig Schelde Ebbe's tortured Mary and the most stomach-churning cliffhanger in TV history (warning: prospective mothers may wish to turn their attentions away for the last few minutes).
Everything about ""The Kingdom"" smacks of class, with well-drawn characters and effective performances populating a hospital unlike anything American TV would even dare to cook up. Sure it's long and the language barrier will be a problem for some, but divert your prejudices elsewhere and lap up this horror-comedy classic. Just remember what Trier tells us peaking through his fingers come journey's end (""Always take the good with the evil..."") As for the DVD, a Region 1 version does exist, as well as a Region 2 double-disc edition, which comes complete with the Lars von Trier-documentary ""Tranceformer"", otherwise seen on the Criterion Edition DVD of Trier's debut film, ""The Element Of Crime"". And, the bad news, Jaregard and Rolffes (and one of the dishwashers too) have sadly passed away, so ""The Kingdom 3"" isn't likely to be arriving anytime soon.",1026000000,5,3928,5.367909238249595
768375,5,6304018959,"Very little I can say about this without appearing to be a one-man Lars von Trier marketing team.
I saw the first series of this purely by accident quite a while ago, and was completely bowled over by the experience. It has just about everything that you could want - hauntings, unexpected pregnancy, several unscrupulous doctors (one of them being prepared to go to extreme lengths to get his hands on a dying patient's liver), racial intolerance, and above all else, the feeling that there is something else going on that you just can't quite put your finger on. To top it all off, the only person who seems to understand what is really happening, is the guy who washes the dishes in the canteen.
I think that it's fair to say that this is not for everyone. However, if you enjoy the style of David Lynch, or indeed the other creations of Lars von Trier, then you'll get more out of this than most.
Only two complaints - why is this not on DVD; why is the second series impossible to find in any format (in the UK anyway). Happily this is now only one complaint, since this was recently released in the UK on DVD :)  Now, if they'd just get the 2nd series released.

The Kingdom is the most technologically advanced hospital in Denmark.  Unfortunately it also has it's creepy past.  Won't say anymore about that so as not to ruin the movie!
The characters are great, no single lead as it's an ensemble cast.  It has multiple storylines and plot twists, it's not all horror in the classic sense of the term. It's an oddball movie, the type not usually done in the US.  While some comments have been made comparing it to a David Lynch film, that doesn't quite hit the mark. Lynch wishes he could make a film like this, and it's got entirely its' own brand of weirdness.
