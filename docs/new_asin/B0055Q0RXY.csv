It's a great movie that so many people are not able to watch, and I believe it's just so sad for those who have never seen it. Not to mention that it's a wonderful family movie with Native American culture and the nature of being blessed with seeing some ways of our First Peoples.",1499299200,,450,4.125

It has humor, gorgeous scenery, a gripping adventure story, and beautiful horses.  The story focuses on the teen boy who is sent to spend the summer with his grandfather on the reservation.  His disdain for Native American ways and his grandfather in particular soon changes as he comes to love the horse his grandfather buys him and he seeks to thwart the plans of men illegally rounding up wild horses for sale to meat packers.",1450656000,,556,4.575757575757576
