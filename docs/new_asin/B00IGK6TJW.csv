6263623,4,B00IGK6TJW,"This early post is for any fans of the show wondering if there were any extra features to be found  in this ""complete series"" package - nope. What you are getting is the exact original 1st and 2nd season packages bundled together in a teal colored slipcase at a price that's currently better than buying each season individually, so in that respect, this is the way to go.

As for the show itself, I didn't even know it had been cancelled - I saw an episode from the first season at a friend's house and liked it enough to put Magic City on my "" things to view"" list.

Was walking through a store and saw this set for just $25, so I grabbed it.

If you like period shows centering around gangster culture (the Godfather films, Goodfellas, Boardwalk Empire etc.), then you probably already know about this show. If not, it's a gangster drama set in late 1950's Miami.

I will change my review as needed once I've seen the whole series...",1401926400,4,936,4.38728323699422

Slick, stylish and gorgeous. Guaranteed to make you sit up and take notice. Can't say enough about this series as a whole. Fans of THE GODFATHER Trilogy, L.A.

Was not that it was badly written or poorly performed, I just did not like the choices made by the producers, writers and directors.

Now I can see why so many Cubans hates us back then.  My copy went into the trash.  I can't believe this made it into two (or 3?) seasons.

Well put together.  There's a bit of nudity, but it's tastefully done; a bit of violence, but not overly so.

6263658,5,B00IGK6TJW,"Magic City is one of those series that really sticks to you if you fit into any one of the many reasons that might attract you to that kind of show.

Created by Mitch Glazer who is also one of the principle producers it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Olga Kurylenko, Steven Strait and Jessica Marais, in the main roles. Produced for the Starz network Magic City originally ran from March 30, 2012 and finished up two seasons on August 9, 2013. It was not renewed for a third season. Currently it can be viewed on Netflix.

If you have any connection to Jewish or American Jewish life, Cuban or Cuban American life, and have any interest at all in stories about organized crime in the free world, or just enjoy anything salacious, violence, sex, steamy romance, intrigue, suspense, then you should watch Magic City. In other words, just about anyone will like this drama.

The show takes place in 1959 Miami, the Kennedys, the 59 Dodgers, hula hoops, great big Cadillacs with shark fins in the back and Ed Sullivan on Sunday nights, all come together at The Miramar Playa, a fictitious but very authentic first class Hotel on the Miami strand.

The set production was excellent. The dcor, the costumes were perfect for the time. As someone who was a very little boy in 1959 it took me back. The way men dressed with their tight pants and outer jac-shirts. Zippo lighters never seemed to be far away from a pack of cigarettes. And, of course, everyone smoked. Doctors were starting to warn about the health effects of smoking but It wasn't until 1966 when the Surgeon General became serious and placed warning labels on packs of cigarettes.

Jewish organized crime, hardly ever romanticized in favor of the Italians which were more demonstrative in 20th century Americana, plays a central role in this series as they live up to every underworld stereotype, from degenerate sex to the worst kinds of human sadistic behavior. Apparently, they ran Miami during the post World War II years, probably led by Meyer Lansky although his name is never mentioned. Rather, James Caan, in a supporting role plays Sy Berman, the Lansky type character in the story.

Shamefully, there is a part of me that is proud of Jewish gangsterism. Probably no different than being proud of Jewish sports heroes, Benny Leonard, Hank Greenberg, Sandy Koufax, etc. Not sure why that is. Maybe because they broke the mold of the stereotype bookish Jew, physically weak, and not able to stand up for himself.  But, Jewish gangsters prove that definition wrong. Maybe that is what I am proud of. Of course, those are stereotypes and do not reveal reality and have at any rate become null and void since the State of Israel showed that Jews could fight as well as anyone.

In the 1930s a group of New York Jewish wise guys once broke up an American Nazi party meeting. They ran into the hall and just started beating every one up. Jews beating up Nazis, how cool is that? But then afterward they probably went out and tortured to death one of their street enemies, something none of us could ever sanction. So its a strange kind of kinship the rest of us have with that element.

As a Zionist Jew I can never forget what American Jewish crime did for the Jews in 1948. Because of an international ban on weapons imposed by the Truman administration, the proposed Jewish State in Palestine was left to its own devices to secure proper weapons to fight the war with the Arabs everyone knew was coming.

American Jewish crime was one of several important sources that secured the kinds of weapons which enabled Israels fledgling armed forces to barely survive the first month of their War of Independence. It is quite possible that the Jews could have done it without that segment of American  Jewish society nevertheless the  contribution in history has always been appreciated by people like me.

One of my favorite sayings attributed to Albert Schweitzer really applies to these types of situations. You don't have to be an angel to be a saint.

But I do digress.

Mitch Glazer, the producer grew up in Miami Beach, in and around hotels during that time period, so his experiences of being told stories and listening to staff and family tell him lurid tales of crime and how crime don't pay (for anything) became the basis for this series.

With character names like Ben Diamond, Judi Silver and Belvan Jaffe, living the low life in Miami Beach, they were gangsters and bad people but they were part of the Jewish family just the same. Like my own mother and father most of that generation were born from immigrant parents so the Yiddish expressions are common, the cultural ties of common background, heritage, and history bound that community together.

Its no different than the Italian or Irish or any other immigrant community in the American experience. These just happen to be Jewsgangster Jews. Criminal gangs have historically bonded over cultural similarities, and the Jewish crime, whether in Miami, Chicago or L.A. did the same.  Make no mistake, these are bad people, they did bad things but they make for exciting television.

Along with the magnificent set direction, wardrobe and meticulous detail of the period, the show does take on a realism. You think you are looking at 1959. With that prop expertly devised all Glazer had to do was to tell his story.

The show also tells of a symbiotic closeness between the anti-Castro Cubans who took asylum in Miami after the revolution. Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and along with his hatchet man Che Guevara instituted a reign of terror in which they jailed and executed Cuban nationals. Many innocent people, sometimes whole families were murdered just because they were rich and had some kind of connection to the Batista regime.

On all levels those relationships between Jews and Cubans seem to work in Magic City, love, war, honesty, fidelity, it all comes together for the two communities going through life on two similar but parallel life lines never crossing, never descending into tension.  Almost like there is an understanding on the oppressive nature withstood by both groups to both groups. Im not sure if Miami history was that smooth between Cubans and Jews, but even if it wasnt, Glazer made it work for him and his story.

Unfortunately, for me, because I really liked it, the show was cancelled after two seasons. There is hope however. Netflix, has on occasion bought the rights to certain series that were left cliff hanging and consequently many disappointed fans. After purchasing the rights to the three seasons of The Killing from AMC, Netflix produced a season four to tie up all the loose ends. Not ideal but at least it was something. They produced 15 episodes of Arrested Development six years after Fox cancelled it, giving the loyal fans of the show something more that was perceived to be lost.

But, the point is that they could conceivably continue the series if they felt they could get enough of an audience. Whether the show has that or not I don't know.

But, at least we have those two seasons. If you fit into one of the categories I explained at the beginning you will probably like Magic City.

6263659,5,B00IGK6TJW,"A total gem. This is one of the best T.V. shows I've seen. A story of the Jewish hotel business in Miami, with overtones of the Godfather, Casino. The relationship between the Jews and Cubans is interestingly and sensitively portrayed. The gangsters are ruthless, with even James Caan showing up somewhere in season 2.

8642019,5,B00IGK6TJW,"Critics got this wrong - it's a great series. Starts slow, takes two episodes to hook you, but it's terrifically directed, both in terms of look and feel but more - they get brilliant performances repeatedly from a great cast. Little surprises that are every bit as surprising as any of the best HBO. Olga Kurylenko, whose beauty may make her acting career suffer its so radiant, is particularly good at taking a needy figure and turning her into someone for whom you feel and cheer. But everyone is great, especially the two sons and character Judy Gold, the prostitute with a heart that's more complex than gold but really interesting. And Danny Huston is really interesting. He takes a psychotic monster and gives him pathos that doesn't diminish him but makes him somehow approachable. It's great television. My bet is the critics were not ready for non-stereotype Jews on television. It's not that Glazer's characters are tons more accurate in a general characterization of Jews than the cliche stock comic figures usually portrayed on screen - but they are more nuanced and build out real characters and differences. Writer/producer Mitch Glazer aimed for something very big and iconic. I can't say he quite got there - ultimately it's a dramedy or melodrama, but then so is Upstairs/Downstairs and or even - as self-consciously stylistic as it was - Madmen. It doesn't deal with as fertile social issues, and is way more willing to exploit history than fully explore it, but nevertheless it has its own truth and pungence.",1510444800,,1529,4.9073359073359075
