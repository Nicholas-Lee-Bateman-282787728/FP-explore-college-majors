5635517,5,B00BJO5T0C,"Nicole Beharie is skilled!! No really, she is like a gem and I loved her character in this movie. I like this movie also because it shows that being mentally ill isn't a wrong or right choice but more just a way of being. Its one of those movies that stick with you because it makes you think.",1394064000,6,293,4.068965517241379
5635518,5,B00BJO5T0C,I love the mental part f this movie since I love Psychology anyway.  I liked how it was done and made you think at all times.,1390348800,,125,3.8076923076923075
5635519,3,B00BJO5T0C,"This movie started out very slow moving, with a stranger forcing his way into another stranger's apartment stating his sister felt the person in the apartment needed help.  The dialogue was disjointed and went on and on without really going anywhere.  A good plus was that Nicole Beharie did an excellent job of being a mental case, flipping back and forth.  The best thing I can say about the other actor is that he was cute.  This would have played better as an episode of that television show ""CATFISH.""  Terrible writing, I would not recommend anyone deliberately purchasing this movie.  If you found it on the street good for you.",1388188800,,635,4.7272727272727275
5635520,5,B00BJO5T0C,great movie. great actress and plotline. she was tremendous as a bipolar and the way she could change the moods,1383955200,,111,4.6
5635521,3,B00BJO5T0C,Not bad for a two-person movie. Keeps you engaged. Another good performance by Nicole Beharie. She is turning out to be one of the top African American actress in the present day.,1378598400,,179,4.625
5635522,2,B00BJO5T0C,This moving was long and boring.  Maybe it was just me but I just didn't get it.  I would have rather never wasted my time on this one.,1373846400,2,135,3.7857142857142856
5635523,3,B00BJO5T0C,"this was an ok movie, not quite what i had expected, but overall it was ok, i almost lost interest halfway through because the plot was confusing,",1372291200,3,146,4.444444444444445
5635524,2,B00BJO5T0C,"This movie left more questions than answers.  poorly written.  I would not recommend this movie, this was not a good movie.",1370304000,3,123,4.809523809523809
5635525,1,B00BJO5T0C,"Five minutes into this movie you get a vision of a two-bit writer sitting in a dingy apartment somewhere in NY trying to convince himself he is a brilliant playwright.  Unfortunately for those who may be curious enough to rent or buy this movie it turns out the writer overestimates his own intellect and underestimates his audience.  This is one of those films where the writer tries to convince the audience how intelligent he is through the dialogue of the characters.  It just provides more evidence that NYC elitists who happen to think they can write plays for a living think they are so much better than the rest of us.  I just hate movies, plays or books where the writer is convinced he has come up with a brilliant piece but it just comes across as silly and predictable.  At the beginning of the movie, a man essentially forces himself into the apartment of a woman because, according to him, his sister had met this woman online and thought she needed help.  So realistic!  But more importantly, within a few minutes you can guess the attempted plot twist.  At that point the rest of the movie is just painful to watch.  From beginning to end, we are peppered with dialogue that I am going to guess the author thinks is clever.  For me it was more like, ""who talks like that?""

Don't waste your money.  Let the people responsible for this super-dud find a line of work that matches their level of competence.",1368921600,5,1420,4.547244094488189

5635531,5,B00BJO5T0C,"Lately, I'm trying to 'snatch up' as many
Nicole Beharie vehicles as possible.  I
religiously watch SLEEPY HOLLOW
each week- even ordered the complete
1st season on DVD.  Thought her acting
here was 'the best' I've seen outta her &
that's including her weekly series efforts.

comes to mind for APARTMENT 4E!",1416700800,,346,4.948275862068965

5635535,5,B00BJO5T0C,"Johnny, a psychologist drives all the way to downtown Queens (I think) to help a troubled woman named, Piper, at the begging of friend of both of them. Piper is skeptical at first as well as paranoid, but Johnny finally persuades Piper to let him in so he could help. Problem is once Johnny enters into Pipers apartment and her world, he realizes that maybe meeting the troubled woman was not a good idea after all.

I like this movie, not only because my favorite attractive actress was playing in it but the performance she made. It was perfectly executed and real. She proved that not only was her talent sexy but very professional. I would recommend anyone to watch this. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.",1395100800,9,715,4.5859375
