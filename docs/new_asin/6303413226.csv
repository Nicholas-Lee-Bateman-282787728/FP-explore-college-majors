7845641,5,6303413226,"I bought this as a DVD off of Priscilla's website out of desperation and it was the best thing I did for my back.  I had been to my primary physician and was going to a chiropractor with little relief, while paying $90 a week for the treatment.  I love this DVD because it is divided into two section.  The first section is to gently help stretch out the muscle's while healing, it is short and she instructs you to not continue into the next section until you are having relief from the pain.  The second section of the DVD guides in strengthening the back.  I have always heard, and I found it to be true, that once you have hurt your back it remains weak.  These exercises really keep me pain free if I am consistent in doing them.  Note, that I had seen a physician and been told that surgery was not an option and that exercises were advised for my condition.",1388361600,,864,4.2317073170731705
7845642,5,6303413226,"I am familiar with Priscilla's way of teaching yoga, because I already have a  different VHS, ""15 min. Tune-Up"".
Her teaching method is gentle, caring and I never feel rushed, or pushed.
The repair kit VHS that I just purchased, is exactly what I expected. Priscilla is well informed and also has a segment with a Physical Therapist to help you do things a little diffently if you have difficult back issues.
I am very pleased with my purchase.",1354060800,,444,4.620253164556962
7845643,5,6303413226,"Presented with clear instruction, nice visuals and sound, this is an effective program of stretching and strengthening yoga moves that are sure to improve back pain, increase strength, improve posture and flexibility.  As an RN injured in a car accident, with herniated lumbar disc, I can say  this works! Friends and therapists I know say the same. Priscilla is a  clear and likeable instructor. You'll learn how to move, stand, sit, and  improve over all back health. Great video!",919814400,65,482,5.063291139240507
