8052162,3,B0007UVXTA,"I watched this yesterday with my sons, ages 3 and 6.  Older children might enjoy it (age 5-10), or fans of Celtic music (in particular, Enya).  It was not that good for my younger son.  Half the time, the animation was too quick to follow.  There were many quick ""camera"" changes during action sequences.  The second half was very slow moving, and the 3 year old and I both almost fell asleep.  The only thing keeping me awake was the haunting music.

The music was excellent, but I was surprised that the package and credits didn't give more detail.  Two of the melodies are well-known Enya songs.  For example, one song has an identical melody to Marble Halls (from the album Shepherd Moons), but with different lyrics.  So it seems wrong or incomplete to simply say that Phil Cunningham wrote the music for this DVD.

Overall, this was a unique Christmas DVD that made for an enjoyable 24 minutes on a cold Sunday afternoon.  But I doubt we will go back and watch it again.",1171238400,,976,4.514285714285714
8052163,5,B0007UVXTA,"This was a most enjoyable animated Christmas story with unusual

characters and musical creatures.  The music was most enjoyable.

It was a pleasure to hear that Phil Cunningham, the noted Scottish musician wrote the music and sounds for this DVD.

This DVD will make a special Christmas gift for young and old.",1134259200,,311,4.923076923076923
8052164,5,B0007UVXTA,"This was a delightful DVD, full of fun and the wonderful music of Scotland's Phil Cunningham. We bought several to give out as gifts this Christmas season and kept one for our house. Creative, charming, and worth watching for all ages.  There are a lot of laughs and a charming monster. We wondered why someone as well known as musician Phil Cunningham was not mentioned on the Amazon description of this DVD.
