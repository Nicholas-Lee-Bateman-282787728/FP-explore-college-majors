8419883,4,B004AAJK20,"'Koi Mere Dil Se Pooche' is another remake of 'Sleeping with the Enemy' starring Julia Roberts after Agnisakshi, Daraar and Yaraana.

Surprisingly, 'KMDSP' turned out to be a good remake of SWTE with its own twists and turns.'KMDSP' is Esha Deol's debut movie. Sanjay Kapoor is strictly okay. Nothing much can be said about him. He does look different in a negative role but not terrorising which his role demanded. Aftab Shivdasani is just okay. He has miles to go to scale the ladder of success in the industry. Jaya Bachchan was excellent. Jaspal Bhatti is as usual a nuisance.

Overall, a good movie if not excellent. Watch it if you haven't done yet.",1302220800,,655,4.7368421052631575
