7900392,5,7885142388,"Wu Xia genre films normally employ a large amount of wire work. This film is a must for any Donnie Yen fan. The character Qinglong is a very heroic and tragic character, a product of his unfortunate circumstances, who realizes his sense of honor and rises above his past.

The chemistry and comedy between Donnie and Zhao Wei is especially fun in several of their scenes. Of all Donnie's recent films, this couple appears the most natural on screen.

Sammo Hung gets a brief appearance, but his voice is dubbed even though he is a Cantonese speaker. I found that to be totally unnecessary.

The action is choreographed by one of the team members who worked on Iron Monkey. Donnie, as usual, is outstanding in his wire work and impeccable in his sword play. Donnie is one of the few in the action genre who is just as believable whether a villian or a good guy. This character gets to showcase a little of both. Although not as great a story as Ip Man or The Lost Bladesman, Donnie is very solid and believable as Qinglong. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and its middle eastern inspired soundtrack.",1318118400,,1107,4.58080808080808

7900394,5,7885142388,"Great Donnie Yen movie, but its not like IP MAN. The martial arts in this movie are more wire-driven and the story is centered in the Ming Dynasty. This will appeal to people who like movies like FONG SAI YUK (Jet Li) and the like. If you like more contemporary martial arts that is realistic (like IP MAN, FIST OF LEGEND, etc.) then you might not like this movie. I like all martial arts, and everything Donnie Yen. Great DVD with quality picture and packed with slipcover. Nice!",1296777600,5,480,4.465909090909091
