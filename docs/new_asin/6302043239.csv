The video is straight-forward (no effects - almost amateur) and the concert is straight-forward (no effects) - just the way U2 should be... Just MUSIC.

419142,5,6302043239,"Hmmmm - I'm not sure about all the new U2 hype swirling about the new tour and album.  Afterall - I haven't bought a new U2 album since Joshua Tree,  but I decided to go back to their shows starting in April 2001 at  Pepsi Center.  I had a photo pass and stayed for the duration. AND - a well-connected friend hooked me up with a house mix CD of the first 80 minutes of that show....amazing!  The show last Wednesday at Pepsi was very good.  I don't go to arena shows, but what I'm getting around to saying is that U2 brings it everynight.  They are just so good.  No backup musicians. Different sets each night.  Bono doesn't take a night off onstage.  It was nice to hear the 'old' songs last week......

The old songs, having been released over 20 years ago, are what was so special about U2 when I was in high school.  I grew up in south east  Denver and saw U2 first on MTV when I was a volunteer at United Cable Television, the local cable provider.  The first video was a live version of I Will Follow followed soon after by the single version of Gloria.  It's so weird to think about watching those vids then wondering who the hell these guys were and where they were from.  But when I heard they would be playing at the Rainbow Music Hall - my friends and I had to go.  I guess growing up in the suburbs had one advantage - we got cable before U2 came to Denver the first time.  The Rainbow was general admission and we lined up early in the morning to get close.  Sometime during the wait Adam Clayton drove by the line of concert-goers in his rental.  He stopped and shook hands and signed a few autographs.  He asked why we were lined up 5 hours before the show.  His fingernails were painted black and he had that huge cauliflower hairdo and glasses....

The Red Rocks show a year later was different in that a. it was not indoors b. it rained  c. it was cold.  The word on the radio was that the show was a rainout but the lights for the film were on and I guess we just lined up after a while as we had nothing better to do.  We got in and were told the Alarm and Divinyls would not play - which was of particular interest to me - since I hated them both.  Barry Fey came out and said something about some rainy Bob Dylan concert and then introduced the band.  Oh if Bono could see Barry now.  The U2 stage, massive even back then, was above the cameras and audience so Bono could look down on us and the cameras could look up.  There was a camera on a dolly covered in a tarp in front of us that kept driving back and forth all afternoon - whenever Edge sat at the piano - and it was a bit of a nuisance.  But I figured the footage would be pretty good, and besides, we would get to see them the next night again, only this time indoors, at the CU Events Center.  I vividly remember steam rising from Bono's head and arms as a bright light backlit him when he walked out to the center stage.  He brought out a white flag and planted it in the crowd.  Eventually the flag started to wave back and forth - and Bono - wanting none of this in his film - reached out and steadied it.  I don't think anyone has set bonofires on the outposts at Red Rocks since.  The set list (which I still have) reads:

Control

Cat Dubh

Into The Heart

Surrender

Two Hearts

419143,5,6302043239,"It's hard to believe it's been over 20 years since ""Blood Red Sky"" was filmed. As a couple of other people have posted who were there, it was an amazing event. It felt historic even at the time.

Although the weather is exactly why it's so dramatic with the fog and steam, the entire show was very nearly cancelled because of the conditions. Like one guy mentioned, it was about 35 degrees out at Red Rocks that night, after a full day of cold drizzling rain.

I was the music editor of the local alt.weekly paper at the time, and had been in on some meetings announcing the filming.  Barry Fey, the concert's promoter, had been a very early supporter of U2 and booked them into a small 1400-seat theater in Denver when they first toured the US for ""Boy."" So they liked Fey and wanted to work with him for this Red Rocks gig.

Unfortunately it got cold in the days before the concert. They actually did officially cancel it -- both The Alarm and U2 agreed to play a second, make-up concert the next day in a local arena (DU, I think, or maybe Regis University). But they decided to do the Red Rocks performance anyway because they'd invested so many thousands of dollars for the shoot -- the pyrotchnics (there are normally no fires atop the dramatic sandstone rocks around the stage!), the camera equipment, the technicians.

I'm sure if the filming hadn't been planned, the performance would have been cancelled in a second. I don't remember if the show as sold out (I kind of doubt it), but in the 9,000-seat amphitheater, only about 3,000 people showed up for the filming. The movie does a great job of making it seem like a full house.

It's to Bono and U2's credit that they came out roaring, and to all music fans' benefit that this performance was caught on camera.

I alternated between the 5th row in the middle and the 2nd row over to stage left, and was in awe of what was going on on the stage. U2 simply took it over and made it their own showcase gig, as if they were playing an audition for entrance into heaven. Everything was (I'm sure) unscripted, including the bit with the flag and bringing the girl on stage. It was all natural, just like the setting.

This was just at the point, as some writers have mentioned, where the band was evolving from cult status to superstardom, and they were just hitting their stride.

One thing, though: their performance was hot, but not hot enough to help you forget the cold -- I froze my butt off that night!

As for why no DVD, I wonder how much of it is because of licensing and ownership rights. I don't even know if TTS, the Denver-based production company that managed the shoot, exists anymore. So I wonder who owns the rights to the film.

Perhaps U2, and maybe they don't want it on DVD ultimately because of the made-for-TV audio and video quality.

I happened to stumble on this series of reviews and I'm glad I stopped to read everyone's comments. It brought back a lot of memories, and made me want to root around my basement for my promotional copy of the film from TTS!",1106870400,65,3041,4.420393559928444
419144,5,6302043239,"The venue, Red Rocks, Colorado, a concert capturing the end of the ""hungry years"" for U2. Date:Jun 5. 1983.

Opening act: The Alarm, who cancelled their part of the show due to the bad weather.

The concert itself is roughly about an hour on the video. The CD that was released around the time has 8 songs, the video 12, keeping it at a length suitable for a TV show.

The actual concert had 18-20(!), so hopefully they will put the full concert out.

Keep in mind that this was shot for TV in the 80s and not film, so the video quality is not the greatest, and because this is on videotape, the sound quality is better left to listening to it on CD.

But the songs, performance, and setting lead to a concert that is brimming with energy that keeps your attention through the performance, and there are enough performances on video (Rattle and Hum, ZooTV, PopMart, Elevation, Go Home) that you have a nice chronicle of how they've progressed over the years.

The first 3 songs come running out of the gate, with ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" being the highlight of the show. ""October"" slows things down, and they rev it back up through ""New Years Day"", ""I Threw a Brick"", ""Gloria"" the singalong ""Party Girl"", and winding it up with the still great ""I Will Follow"", ending with the anthemic ""40"".

Depending on what setlist you look at, I did think that ""Out of Control"", ""An Cat Dubh"", ""Into The Heart"", ""Twilight"", ""I Fall Down"", and ""Two Hearts Beat As One"" should not have been left off because all of them were very worthy of being on the video. Just a few days previous to this show, they were also filmed for the legendary ""US"" Festival, something that should be put out as well...

I would love to see more of the early U2 performances they did for TV, a lot of it exists out there (they are one of the most bootlegged bands ever) and it would be great if they put some of it out because a lot of people either haven't seen them in years or never have.

I would like to see ""Under a Blood Red Sky"" become a combo CD/DVD in Surround and uncut. It's definitely the best out of the ""early years"" of how they were in concert.",1106697600,2,2122,4.324937027707809

419146,5,6302043239,"I first watched this concert when it aired on USA network on a show called Night Flight, must've been 1984 or 1985, and I was just blown away by it; hard to believe that was nearly 20 years ago! They look like a young, relatively unknown, hard working band in this video. Taped outdoors in bad weather, the cold rain and fog have a dramatic affect on the performance, and the music stands out. My favorites from the set are Surrender, A Day Without Me, October and Party Girl. Overall, great live concert footage. Also, if you can find them, U2 played the US Festival the same year this was taped, and the Amneisty International Concert ('86? '87?) was a riveting performance.",1098230400,,676,4.549180327868853
419147,4,6302043239,"This show dates from 1983, and was filmed at Red Rocks in the USA - a natural amphitheatre that provided a memorable backdrop for this, U2's first concert film. The best feature of the performance is the very strong connection U2 evidently makes with its audience. You can feel the energy and intensity in the band's playing, and the strident tone of their War album tracks like New Year's Day and Sunday Bloody Sunday is complemented by effective older tracks like I Will Follow, 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and The Electric Co. This music really did lift U2 to the top of the rock music world , and deservedly so. No one else in 1983 was making such strong guitar-based rock music, and U2 here were still young, charismatic, improving and developing an expanding fanbase. Highly Recommended.",1083456000,3,786,4.744525547445256

What I admire most about this U2 concert, is their dedication to excellence. While fans wear jackets and coats, U2 performs in the freezing cold. Steam is clearly seen coming off their sweating bodies and from Bono's lips as he sings song after song.
Inspiring music, moving music with a beautiful Heavenly sound, and good hard hitting Rock-n-Roll, is the best way to describe what is on this video. Please note that this concert is from 1983. 12 songs are performed, including the mega hits Sunday Bloody Sunday(of which the clip was used on MTV back in the 80's), New Year's Day, and Gloria.
If you like unflinching Rock And Roll at its best, you can't do without this video. I own it, and it was WELL worth what I paid for it. Any music that brings a glorious tear to my eyes is worth  what I pay for it.",1083110400,,1063,4.262376237623762

Maybe a year later I decided to watch it again; I `am happy I did. This concert is in support of the ""BOY"" album is superb. U2 is note for note live. The visuals are excellent and the cameras stay on a bandmember for more than a second. Bono and company are full of energy! Even you don't like the songs the recordings and feeling is here.

419151,5,6302043239,"Like many children of the 80s, I first saw this concert on MTV, back when they used to show entire concerts LIVE every Saturday evening.  This was an awesome compilation of their earlier works, played in a drizzling rain with just an incredible vibe coming through the TV.

I think anyone looking to see U2's progression from College Rock favorite to Super Group to Mega-Stardom should see this video, as it really sums up their first three albums and is sort of a break before their next work, the Unforgettable Fire, which was their first album that really crossed over to mainstream radio (or maybe mainstream radio moved a bit toward the college alternative).  Whatever--this is definitely a milestone in the history of the band.

Hardcore fans will notice that many of the tracks, like Gloria and Bloody Sunday are played quite a bit faster in this concert than the studio tracks.  I personally like them better that way.

The CD of this concert was issued back when CD's must have had some storage problems, so some of the ad-lib lyrics added in songs like Electric Company and Party Girl can be heard on this video I think (and the LP) but not on the CD due to some copyright issues.

I haven't seen all that many concerts in my life, but I think if you ask anyone for one of the most important concerts of the 80s they will mention Live from Red Rocks.  I have a tape of this concert, but am just dying for a DVD release.  It is the one and only concert video I'll ever buy, if it comes to DVD.",1034553600,4,1502,4.413043478260869

The setting, Red Rocks ampitheater near Denver, is a spectacular geological setting, with wind, fog, gas torches producing gigantic gouts of flame high above the audience, and mountain air chilly enough to show clouds of vapor pouring off Bono's skin.

7820223,4,6302043239,"I wasn't at the well-known Concert at Red Rocks, where U2 played on June 5, 1983, which was, coincidentally, my 23rd birthday.

I was at the show about a week later, in Dallas, where U2 played to an unsold-out 1200 seat theater, located inside -- get this -- a bowling alley. (Dallas had a really small ""underground"" rock scene then, and I saw REM, The Pretenders, and even Talking Heads at this unlikely venue. ""The Bronco Bowl"" was small and intimate and had great sound). The Irish Rockers had never been to Dallas, and had never even had any commercial radio-play there. If you were a North Texan who didn't have MTV, and a lot of people didn't, it was very likely that you'd still never have heard of U2 at all. Not me, though, having recently been in college in Rochester, NY, I was very aware of U2, and a very big fan by this point. I had all three of their LPs, including the newly released ""War"". I would have seen them play at Rochester Institute of Technology in '82 if it hadn't been for a huge exam I had to study for the next day.

So here was my first chance to see them live, on The War Tour, with 800 other hard-core believers.

Let me say they did not disappoint. In fact, Bono, Edge, Larry and Adam proceeded to perform the greatest rock concert I have ever seen, before or since. And I have seen everybody (including U2 in later years)! The kids ripped my head clean off! The energy was incredible. The sound, the songs, the stage itself, were all ablaze. Bono went as far to the back of the stage as he could get, and ran, full speed ahead, taking a leaping header into the crowd. That's right; head first, arms out, like diving in to a pool, landing on the shoulders of astonished fans. I kept blinking my eyes, wondering if I had actually just seen it, or had hallucinated the dive. (On the Red Rocks video, by contrast, he carefully falls backwards in to the crowd). Bono had not yet achieved the God-like and masterful showmanship he would very soon have. At this point, he was flying high on his own energy, like a kid with a brand new rocket-ship. He was always right on the edge of control, at times literally staggering and swaggering, like he was drunk with his power. (By the time I saw them again in 1985, in a 20,000 seat arena, he had learned to channel and control that spirit like a Shaman). In Dallas in `83, it was already clear that Bono was an incredible performer and would-be Superstar.

Speaking of The Edge, his guitar-playing, all shimmery and fluid and surrounding and drony and dreamy, was a total rock revelation for me, myself a young guitarist. I soon went out and bought an analog delay like the one he used.

The girl I took with me was one of those people who had never even heard of U2 before that night. On the way out of the show, she thanked me profusely for introducing her to the astonishing Irish Band. Haven't seen her since that night, but, I'll bet all these years later, she's still telling people, ""I saw U2 before they were famous!""

So, why do I post this review of ""Under a Blood Red Sky"", being that I was not at Red Rocks? Well, it's very fortunate for the world of rock music, and U2 fans, that it was filmed. I was really excited when I heard it was coming out, and that indeed it was shot within days of the show I saw, because it captures U2 on the rise to stardom, and why they deservedly became among the greatest bands in history. Of course I bought the 12"" record and the VHS video as soon as they came out.

Is Red Rocks as good as the Dallas show I saw? No. It's actually tamer by comparison. (Too bad they didn't film THAT one!). But will Red Rocks mesmerize you? Will it blow your mind?

Might it be the best rock show you've ever seen?

Oh yeah....

I have seen them perform live three times - once when they were touring to support ""The Unforgettable Fire"", and twice during the ZooTV tour.

It seems evident from one particular camera on stage with the band, almost as if there's something on the lens.

Even though it was kind of hoky, I loved that video and still do.

I saw them in Norfolk on this tour, and they were about what you'd expect:  fantastic, silly (Bono had and still has that self-conscious, self-righteous air that I still find completely forgivable).

And, now that I live in Colorado and go to Red Rocks several times a year (most years), I wanted to go rent this and watch it.  After all, it's NEW YEARS DAY today (2007).

I was newly introduced to U2 as MTV was running their New Years Day video often.  I loved the Edge's driving guitar and Bono's passionate vocals as much as the visuals of snow covered scenery with the band playing and horses breathing in the cold air.  As other reviewers have noted, the show's status was confused by foul weather which dwindled the crowd a bit. But the rain and fog was a minimal nuisance as the band took the stage under burning pyres.  Bono even took to the ampitheater seats with the large flag and it was the first time I'd witnessed a performer go so confidently through the crowd. No body guards buffered him as I recently saw in Seattle during the How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb tour.  I was thrilled that concert promoter Barry Fey offered a second night at the CU events center free with a ticket stub.  The Alarm opened for U2 the next night.  Nothing I have seen in 23 years since has surpassed that outdoor U2 show. The memory was all the sweeter for the company I kept (that's me and her in matching white 'SPU' sweatshirts). I haven't talked to her in 22 years but if she's out there and reads this, please contact me to reminence.  More than documenting my own listening history, this video serves as a historical marker of a band emerging into widespread stardom and celebrity.  It deserves to be processed to DVD format.",1130889600,2,1525,4.398576512455516
