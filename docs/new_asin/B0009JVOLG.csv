2295867,5,B0009JVOLG,"This is a modern, more complete version of the previous video the Paris Opera Ballet came out with in the 1960's, which featured Ghislaine Thesmar and Michael Denard.  This previous one had set the standard in some ways.  To be sure, Ghislaine Thesmar coaches ballerinas in the POB for this part(see some of my reviews for the POB documentaries), so her stamp is still here!  This newer version compares well with the older one.  Most significantly, this one is a stage production, performed with a live audience, the older one was a movie, and we get a more complete choreography here, including many solos and small group dances not seen in the older one.  This classic ballet is one of the most choreographically ambitious ballets in the classical repertoire and should not be passed up!  Now, this dvd will set the standard for a long time to come for the Lacotte version.",1142726400,15,876,4.730263157894737
2295868,5,B0009JVOLG,"We have recently bought this DVD and highly recommend it.  Picture and sound quality are gorgeous. Aurlie Dupont's dancing is magnificent. She is elegant, weightless and she truly IS la Sylphide by expressing all her feelings and grace. Mathieu Gano is extremely elegant, athletic and very expressive. The ""Corps de Ballet"" is a model of precision and beauty. The forest dcor with the flying Sylphides is magnificent. Lacotte's interview explains how he has succeeded in rebuilding the ballet as presented in 1832 from information painfully gathered over the years. A lovely moment for ballet lovers.",1133568000,17,600,5.315789473684211
2295869,5,B0009JVOLG,"When La Sylphide first premiered on March 12, 1832, Marie Taglioni made ballet history by dancing in the first white tutu and dancing the whole performance en pointe. It is considered the first Romantic ballet (not the court dances or court-inspired dances of the time of Louix the Fourteenth). For the first time, a world of whimsy and poetic imagery was staged. La Sylphide tells the story of a Scotsman who is married but falls for a mysterious aerial creature- La Sylphide. There is much plotless dancing and beautiful forest scenery. A villain- Madge, bent on ruining the lovers. This production from 2004 is performed by the Paris Opera Ballet company. It's beautifully re-created from the original choreography by Taglioni. The music is masterfully orchestrated and the bonus feature recounting the history is a fine addition. Own this DVD today if you love classic ballet.",1125619200,40,880,5.075862068965518
2295870,5,B0009JVOLG,"I really enjoy the Paris Opera DVDs I have been able to find.  I especially enjoy the commentaries found in them that explain the history of the ballet and preparations involved.  It is often so hard to find information about ballet history.  No one knows what these dancers of the past looked like, which is unfortunate for the further development of this strange art.  The ballet itself was danced in keeping with its style and the dancers were in top shape.  I recommend these DVDs to serious ballet students.",1125187200,9,512,4.707865168539326
2295871,5,B0009JVOLG,"Wow! This was such a terrific ballet to watch. Costumes were wonderful, sets were beautiful. The Paris Opera Ballet did such an excellent job creating this production. It is somewhat of a reproduction piece, being pieced together from original choreography with some new added. The dancing definitely has an old world ""period"" feel to it - not a pyrotechnical crowd jumps to their feet kind of production. I was stunned by Ms Dupont and Mr Ganio. Dupont has the most beautiful feet I have ever seen - She's a beautiful dancer, but her feet were just exquisite. And Ganio was the most graceful male dancer I've ever seen. A lot of the dancing is somewhat plotless - lots of the guy dancing with sylphs in the woods, but it doesn't get boring because you keep saying wow about the dancers. This is a must own for ballet lovers. And the interview/making of/history of La Sylphide bonus was very educating.",1120780800,24,902,4.679245283018868
8062107,5,B0009JVOLG,"This ballet, written in 1832, is seen by many as having some claim to being the birth of the Romantic ballet era. It has all the necessary ingredients - the popular romantic backdrop of Scotland, the love of a mortal for a supernatural creature, the appearance of a witch, fortune telling, deception, vengeance and unintentional murder. In addition there is the unashamedly lyrical and well crafted music of Schneitzhoeffer to which was added most attractive and sympathetic choreography of Taglioni, a dancer who was regarded particularly highly at the time and of whom Gautier said was 'as sublime with each step as Racine was sublime with each page'.

This production by the Paris Ballet is a deliberate attempt to recreate exactly those original performances. In this it is wholly successful. The Scottish setting is sumptuously created with excellent costuming and sets. It must be said that, judging from this ballet score, the composer seems to have had very little understanding of the proper Scottish sound - so no droning effects to represent bagpipes for example. Also, the predominately happy and always lyrical music avoids disturbing its nature with any unseemly tragic or stirringly dramatic tone such as can be heard in Swan Lake onwards for example.

The male witch puts over his role well as do all the other supporting character parts. The corps de ballet are faultless in portraying the Scottish assembly or the fairy world of the supernatural. The two lead dancers are fully up to the task of portraying the misled groom, James, and the sadly doomed sylph. Special praise is due for these characterisations by the graceful and attractive Aurelie Dupont who is well supported by Mathieu Ganio at all times.

There is a competing alternative version given by the Danish Ballet where the same story receives different music and choreography. That too, is most enjoyable and expertly done but is not the subject of this review. Suffice it to say that both versions are thoroughly entertaining and rewarding in their own particular ways. True enthusiasts will, no doubt, be tempted to buy both and should not be disappointed with either.

In this case the whole thing is recorded well with sympathetic camera work giving a nice balance between panoramic and closer views and with good DTS surround sound. Highly recommended. The original 2004 TDK version has now been re-issued by Arthaus as here.",1342224000,2,2413,5.055276381909548
8062108,4,B0009JVOLG,"The early nineteenth century marks the advent of a unique style and unforgettable dance, the romantic ballet. The dance of that time looking for a way to affirm, and the Romantic style was the answer and the reason for the popularity of ballet. Elements such as the supernatural, death by overwhelming passion, the ideal woman fell in love and continue to this day. Not only in the realm of ideas that the ballet progresses. Appear for the first time the romantic tutus, translucent fabrics and translated into several layers give the idea of lightness of the dancers. For the first time you use a pointe shoe, the dancers seemed to float. New technical resources by the staging allowed the dancers fly, literally, across the stage. All this culminated in formulas that would be followed and repeated in many other ballets. Success guaranteed.
  Filippo Taglioni choreographed La Sylphide for her daughter, the great ballerina Marie Taglioni. Despite the enormous success in the nineteenth century, the ballet has fallen into oblivion in the twentieth century. Pierre Lacotte made a deep study of the dance of the season and restaged the ballet in 1971 for the Opra de Paris. Choreography redone and thought to his wife, the dancer Gislaine Thesmar. Lacotte this time seems to have bothered with the original choreography. His version has steps and techniques that were not even imagined at the time. Complex and far-fetched to current standards, Lacotte takes creative liberties in excess, both show the virtuosos of the dancers and falls into exaggeration.
  The version of the Paris Opera on DVD is recorded based on the choreography of Lacotte. The production is pure whimsy, fills the eyes with the colors and vibe it conveys. The sets are lavish, impeccable costumes, vibrant light. The performance of soloists ""toiles"" is overwhelming. Aurlie Dupont is a dancer with perfect steps, conveys the emotion and the fragility of his character. Gani Mathieu holds strength, virility when needed and a passion that enchants. All this combined with a great technique. The corps de ballet of the Paris Opera is need in this 2004 version. We have a video of great plasticity, which charms the beauty of colors, production and choreography. Lacotte play to the audience, and pulls warm applause. But all he does is incompatible with modern and original work.
  Media that sank in a short time, the Laser Disc brings us an interesting version of La Sylphide, ballet Kiev 80s. This version is much closer to the original nineteenth century. His choreography is simple, their numbers are lighter and all the technological stuff Paris does not exist. A choreography that did not seek the blockbuster, but a rescue of the original. Despite the success of this ballet, the question remains: why did he fall into oblivion? One answer is in the music of Jean Schneitzhoeffer (nomezinho complicated). Lack a catchy theme, one that stays in memory, which delights the audience. His music is simple, a lack of success melody. The ballet Giselle is a theme that drives almost the entire plot, so it is in repertory until the present day, while La Sylphide is past.

Portuguese:

 O incio do sculo XIX marca o advento de um estlo nico e inesquecvel de dana, o bal romntico. A dana dessa poca procurava um caminho para a afirmao, e o estlo romntico foi a resposta e um dos motivos da popularidade do bal. Elementos como o sobrenatural, a morte pela paixo avassaladora, a mulher ideal caram no gosto e continuam at os dias de hoje. No  s no campo das idias que o bal evolui. Aparecem pela primeira vez os tutus romnticos, tecidos translcidos e transpostos em vrias camadas do a idia de leveza das bailarinas. Pela primeira vez se utiliza a sapatilha de ponta, as bailarinas pareciam flutuar. Novos recursos tcnicos na cenografia permitiram que as danarinas voassem, literalmente,  pelo palco. Tudo isso culminou em frmulas que seriam seguidas e repetidas em diversos outros bals. Sucesso garantido.
  Filippo Taglioni coreografou La Sylphide para sua filha, a grande bailarina Marie Taglioni. Apesar do enorme sucesso no sculo XIX,  o bal caiu no esquecimento no sculo XX. Pierre Lacotte fez um profundo estudo da dana da poca e remontou o bal,  em 1971,  para a Opra de Paris. Coreografia refeita e pensada para sua esposa, a bailarina Gislaine Thesmar. Lacotte dessa vez parece no ter se importado com a coreografia original. Sua verso possu passos e tcnicas que nem eram imaginados na poca. Complexa e rebuscada para os padres vigentes, Lacotte toma liberdades criativas em excesso, quer mostrar as virtuoses dos bailarinos e cai no exagero.
  A verso da Opra de Paris gravada em DVD  baseada na coreografia de Lacotte. A produo  puro capricho, enche os olhos pelas cores e vibrao que transmite. Os cenrios so suntuosos, os figurinos impecveis, a luz vibrante. A performance dos solistas ""toiles""  arrasadora. Aurlie Dupont  uma bailarina com passos perfeitos, transmite a emoo e a fragilidade de sua personagem. Mathiou Ganio  detentor de fora, virilidade quando necessrio e uma paixo que encanta. Tudo isso aliado a uma grande tcnica. O corpo de baile da Opra de Paris est preciso nessa verso de 2004. Temos um vdeo de grande plasticidade, que encanta pela beleza das cores, da produo e da coreografia. Lacotte joga para o pblico,  e arranca aplausos calorosos. Mas tudo que ele faz  moderno e incompatvel com a obra original.
  Uma mdia que naufragou em pouco tempo, o Laser Disc nos traz uma verso interessante de La Sylphide, do bal de Kiev dos anos 80. Essa verso  muito mais prxima ao original do sculo XIX. Sua coreografia  mais simples, seus nmeros so mais leves e toda a parafernlia tecnolgica de Paris no existe. Uma coreografia que no buscou o sucesso de pblico e sim um resgate do original. Apesar do sucesso desse bal,  fica a pergunta:  por que ele caiu no esquecimento? Uma das respostas est na msica de Jean Schneitzhoeffer (nomezinho complicado).  Falta um tema cativante, aquele que fica na memria, que encanta o pblico. Sua msica  simples, falta uma melodia de sucesso. O bal Giselle tem um tema que conduz quase todo o enredo, por isso ele est no repertrio at os dias de hoje, enquanto que La Sylphide  parte do passado.",1285718400,,6224,4.924401913875598
8062109,5,B0009JVOLG,I had ordered this blind as I had not seen any. I am very pleased with this performance. I had seen Aurelie Dupont in Sleeping Beauty and was not surprised by her excellent performance. An excellent ballet choice for those who love ballet as colorfully performed.,1262822400,,263,4.739130434782608
8062110,5,B0009JVOLG,"A beautiful rendition of La Sylphide by the Paris Opera Ballet.  Aurelie Dupont is a very amazing ""classical"" ballerina, and plays the role perfectly.  She has amazing technical presicion and it works wonders for this ballet.  Mathieu Ganio is probably one of my favorite male leads, and i think this might have been one of his first performances as an ""etoile.""  Great athleticism and a youthful charm fit nicely with the production.  The corps de ballet proves to be yet again one of the best in the world.  As a whole they are very precise with their movements.

Paris ballet seems to use their own unique version of the music for the ballet as well, of which there is no actual recording, unfortunately.  So for music lovers, this dvd is quite a treat.  During the last act their is a beautiful piece written for french horn....and the dancing during this is very emotional.  All in all, this is one of my favorite ballets.  Great emotion and precision from Aurelie, Amazing athleticism from Ganio, and the corps has amazing unity. very precise.",1256256000,,1049,4.740331491712707
8062111,5,B0009JVOLG,"The choreography in Le Sylphide is quite different from the choreography in Petipa ballets. While Swan Like, Sleeping Beauty, Pequita, etc. contain lots of pirouettes and grand allegro, La Sylphide contains primarily petite allegro. Although the petite allegro is perfectly executed by Aurelie Dupont and her castmates, after awhile I just wanted to see a pirouette. Nothing wrong with the ballet at all, it's just a different stype of choreography.",1254009600,,449,5.428571428571429
8062112,4,B0009JVOLG,"Balletomanes, boys, and girls: I don't want to disillusion you, but what you see in this DVD is NOT the original choreography by Filippo Taglioni of La Sylphide as performed in Paris in 1832.  Taglioni's documentation of his work, for reasons unknown, has not survived.  Contrary to what Pierre Lacotte (who is an otherwise delightful gentleman) would have you believe, the POB's ""re-creation"" is 95% Monsieur Lacotte's invention, and 5% based on documentation (critiques, engravings, etc.) from the period.

The style is far too sophisticated for the early 19th century (compare it with the more mime-intensive Danish version), and the technical demands of the choreography are too ambitious versus what even the best dancers would have been able to accomplish over a century and a half ago.

Nonetheless, Pierre Lacotte has given us a delightful piece of work, proving himself to be a far superior (albeit less prolific) choreographer to his contemporary and fellow POB ""alumnus"" Patrice Bart.

p.s. - hooray for Effie!

In summary, a five star piece of dance and drama, but I must knock one star off because of ""truth in advertising"" issues.",1245628800,15,1144,5.123655913978495
8062113,5,B0009JVOLG,"This ballet definitely rates a five star review. It is the first ballet I have purchased staring Aurelie Dupont and I must say she is quite beautiful in this type of period ballet. I did not like her in the POB production of Sylvia.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delibes-Sylvia-Aurelie-Dupont-Manuel-Legris-Nicolas-Le-Riche-Marie-Agnes-Gillot-Jose-Martinez-Paris-Opera-Ballet/dp/B000C1V89E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delibes - Sylvia / Aurelie Dupont, Manuel Legris, Nicolas Le Riche, Marie-Agnes Gillot, Jose Martinez, Paris Opera Ballet</a>&nbsp;I should say I didn't like that production (not her).

We seem to be drawn to the macabre in our story telling of old. I wouldn't want my child to have ever been told the early versions of The Sleeping Beauty for instance, where she is ravaged by the one waking her instead of being roused from her deep sleep. And of course there is Snow White who must have her heart cut out of her chest and given to her step mother in a box. And by the way, why are step mothers so often depicted as villains? Again in La Sylphide our delicate little fairy is going to have to die. Not for a very good reason, I might add. An old Crone has  her feelings hurt because someone wouldn't let her tell his fortune. So, the innocent little fairy has to die. It's as bad as killing off Hilarion when it was Albrect who deceived Giselle. It wasn't the Sylph who refused to have her fortune told, but James. The danseure, Mathieu Ganio playing James, is only twenty years old but is a very capable dancer and partner for Aurelie Dupont. He is as handsome as she is beautiful and they are a very nice couple together.

More to the point of this review, however. The story is well told in dance as well as setting. There is good lighting and fabulous color in the sets and especially in the costuming. The time period lent itself well to the flow of skirts on both men and women. I hope the men don't mind my calling the kilts skirts, but as I said, very beautiful and colourful (we'll use their spelling). The stage was absolutely filled with all that colour. The outdoor scenes in the forest were also well done with human sized fairies flying about and seeming to hover in the trees. Even there in the night scenes the lighting was good, and the fairies were easily seen as they moved about. In the final scene when the other fairies lifted the Sylph to fly her off to her heaven or wherever Sylphs go, I never did see the wires used to lift them. That was very well done. The most touching moment in the ballet for me is when the Sylph bends over to pick up her little wings after they had fallen off by the magic of the deadly scarf that James wrapped around her. You might just shed a tear or two when she dies, as I usually do, but even though I know it's just a fairy tale, I get emotional. James is quite pathetic too, as he realises he has just caused the death of the one he loved the most, and the old crone gloats not only over James' loss of his beloved Sylphide but also Effie, his fiance, to Gurn.

I thought it was a very beautiful ballet and I'm glad I own it. Another thing you will like on this DVD is the bonus material which tells the history of this ballet and it's famous dancer-choreographer Marie Taglioni.",1217635200,8,3301,4.666666666666667
8062114,4,B0009JVOLG,"I first saw this ballet on Great Performances: Dance in America on PBS about 20 years ago, performed by the Pennsylvania & Milwaukee Ballet & hosted by Peter Martens.  He presented the ballet as originally performed by the Royal Danish Ballet with the original choreography & music.  I taped it and watch it frequently, so I was delighted to be able to obtain a DVD version--or so I thought.  This is NOT the same.  For those who haven't seen the original, it must be thrilling.  But I just prefer the music, the costumes, the staging, etc, as I saw it originally.  The original music is wonderful.  Effie & the other girls wore character shoes, not pointe shoes.  The company danced a wonderful reel.  Jeffrey Gibler (now a ballet master with the Pennsylvania Ballet) was a charming, somewhat naive, adorable Gurn.  I got no feeling at all about the Gurn in the Paris version, but I couldn't help but love Gibler's Gurn.  Melissa Podcasy & Marin Boireu, now ballet masters with the Carolina Ballet, were absolutely fantastic as the Sylph and James.  Lisa Sundstrom was such a charming Effie that it was hard to believe that James could ever leave her, even for the Sylph.  To me that was the definitive Sylphide.  This one doesn't come close to its charm.",1185753600,5,1256,4.675799086757991
8062115,5,B0009JVOLG,"This production is spectacular.  The choreography is stunning; the performances are even better.  Aurlie Dupont doesn't merely dance the lead role; she IS La Sylphide.  She is magical, dazzling.  Her technique is brilliant, and her style is mesmerizing.  It feels like the year is 1932. There are no mediocre dancers in this performance.  I watch a lot of ballets on DVD, and this one really stands out.  If you have a soft spot for Romantic ballets, like Giselle, this is one you'll want to watch over and over.  I purchased it on a whim, and while the other ballets I ordered are great, La Sylphide is the crown jewel of my collection.  I'm a fan of American Ballet Theatre, and as good a company as ABT is, Opra National de Paris very much out does them this time.  By the way, the synopsis is given in French before each act.  You can select English subtitles (though I can't get them to work), but if you can read French, it's fun to review the story in French.  The synopsis helps you recall the details of the story so you follow along better.  Bottom line:  you won't regret picking this DVD.  Five stars don't do it justice.",1153526400,10,1133,4.458536585365854
8062116,5,B0009JVOLG,"This ballet is absolutely exquisite.  The sound is wonderful, and the filming is marvelous.  Aurlie Dupont is a flawless La Sylphide--she floated across the stage with such grace and perfect technique.  Her facial expressions were delicate and lovely, the exact essence of La Slyphide.  The corps de ballet had precise synchronization.  The costumes were stunning, as was the scenery.  The flying Sylphs were remarkably amazing, and added so much to this ballet.  To sum it all up, I would most definately reccomend this ballet to everyone looking for a classical, spectacular, brilliant ballet.",1143849600,10,595,5.333333333333333
