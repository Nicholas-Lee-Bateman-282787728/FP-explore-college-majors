8526039,4,B0087PEMXG,"I actually heard the soundtrack for this movie a couple years ago. The glimpses of the story it conveyed compelled me to hunt down the movie itself.

This film is not four stars because it will make you happy. It is four stars because it will make you confront the underbelly of society. It's so easy to forget how much people are suffering from our comfortable homes in Suburbia.",1405987200,,380,4.507246376811594

8526042,5,B0087PEMXG,"I felt the movie was raw, gritty, and  real. I died however find the movie hard to digest, because of the content of some of the content within the movie. All and  all I loved the movie from beginning to end, and I also loved how the music coincided with the movie. The music just added to the grittiness of the movie. And I loved the soundtrack and videos that accompanied the movie. Playing with fire, Ill manor, and my all time favorite track Deepest Shame.",1384732800,,460,4.337209302325581
