8316725,4,B001KZVQES,"I'm a fan of this DVD.  It follows several regulars from the Toronto street racing scene for one ""season"" of building their cars and racing.  You really get an insight into the personalities of the different racers and see what drives them to make their cars faster and faster.  It's a lot more immersive than most ""streetracing"" movies out there.  It also shows the other side of the law from the Canadian anti-street racing police force.",1328918400,,439,4.7368421052631575
