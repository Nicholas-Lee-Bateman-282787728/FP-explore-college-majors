8603915,5,B00ECNSIZ0,"This is a fantastic document of the Tusk album and tour.  On laserdisc, the picture is clear and the sound is phenomenal, even though this was released before the laserdiscs featured CD quality soundtracks.  As someone who only experienced this on VHS, the laserdisc is the closest this will get to DVD quality.  Recommended.",1389052800,,325,4.981481481481482
