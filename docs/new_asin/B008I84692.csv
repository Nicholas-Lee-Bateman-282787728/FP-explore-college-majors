All the pieces come together in this movie including a solid cast, a moving and thrilling story-line and great production value. It's nice to see a movie that incorporates a topical and timeless plot supported by good acting and great pace. Very entertaining and definitely worth renting or owning.",1342137600,,356,5.155172413793103
5167173,5,B008I84692,Such a good movie! Its like a way way WAY better crime show! Eric Robbers is the man! Plus it deals with some serious racial topics that all mankind should get behind.,1342051200,3,167,4.25
5167174,5,B008I84692,"Deadline is my kind of movie, a heartfelt story that moved me to tears on several occasions. By the end, I was so thankful that I'd seen Deadline because it gave me hope for the future. Deadline tells the story of two investigative reporters, played by odd-couple Eric Roberts and Steve Talley, who get turned on to a cold case civil rights murder. Based on a true story, it has elements that are reminiscent of Ghosts of Mississippi and Mississippi Burning, but ultimately Deadline reminded me most of To Kill a Mockingbird. It's a story of race in the South and manages to show both how far we've come and how far we still have to go as a nation. Rather than dwell on the actual murder, Deadline focuses on the human toll of such crimes. The mother and the girlfriend of the slain black teenager are both permanently scarred by his murder, and that's not all of their pain. The entire town has never recovered from the murder. In some ways, Deadline is similar to the current Trayvon Martin case, giving it a timeliness that is almost surreal. But then I guess that's the point, since such things do seem to happen with distressing regularity. By the end of Deadline, I felt that such crimes may not have to always be part of our national ethos, that there is indeed hope that we can evolve as a people, that we may one day not have to seek justice, but simply be just in the first place.",1342051200,7,1390,4.412451361867705
5167175,5,B008I84692,"This movie is a ""Tell it like it was"" about predjudice in the South. I enjoyed it for Historical reasons,But Mainly because a Classmate of mine played a large role in this Film.",1349654400,,177,4.393939393939394
5167176,4,B008I84692,Nicely done. Eric Roberts very good as usual...interesting true story realized nicely. Shot  in and around Nashville Tn. Have known and worked with Director Kurt Hahn many times...,1349049600,,180,5.428571428571429
5167177,4,B008I84692,"I really enjoyed this movie, however it does get you a little teary eyed and sad during some scenes. What scares me most is that people still think lke this and I hope to God do not do these awful things to others due to race, color or any other differences. Some scenes predictable but overall being a true stoery I found it a good one. Eric Roberts is too funny in some scenes.",1345334400,,379,4.135135135135135
5167178,5,B008I84692,"I'm not one to cry for a movie, but this one actually got me.  Very powerful and timely, a story that had to be told.  I went to Journalism school and can honestly say that this what journalism should be about - not the stuff they teach you in those classes.  Highly recommended and one you'll want to own.",1345161600,,306,4.1525423728813555
5167179,4,B008I84692,"When this film was first mentioned to me, I was prepared to dislike it. I live in Alabama and the tarnished image of my state can sometimes be a bit of a sore point. So, I thought, ""Great! Here is another cliched, stereotypical story about 'backwoods, racist, ignorant Alabama'!"" Are there stereotypes and cliches in this film? Absolutely! I rarely see a film that doesn't have a few of those. Is there a good storyline, humor, some rockin' music, and a few surprising twists? Absolutely!

I soon didn't care that some of the characters were the types that would normally have me rolling my eyes, because it did veer into unexpected directions at times and a few of the lines made me laugh out loud. (A smile or my eyes getting a bit moist are usually as emotional as I get when watching a film. I hate to admit it, but I also cried during one scene) The story kept my interest, and I cared about what was happening with them. Dave Perkins blew me away with the musical score! Some great music in this film! Speaking of great music, I loved seeing J D Souther (writer of outstanding songs like Heartache Tonight, Best Of My Love, etc.) in the role of Lucas Harper.

Bottom line is that there are some flaws, and some of the acting isn't top-notch, but there was also no nudity, obscenities, or scenes I would have been embarrassed to watch with my grandparents...or grandkids. Overall, though, I think director Curt Hahn and writer Mark Ethridge, along with some very fine actors, have a film that shows where we've been, how far we have come, and what a difference truth and light make instead of simply burying our shame and fears. This film is also adapted from Mark Ethridge's novel Grievances. Ethridge is a former managing editor of The Charlotte Observer. Deadline will be released in theaters nationwide on April 13, 2012.",1344470400,2,1830,4.610429447852761
5167180,2,B008I84692,"This storyline is the sort of story one would see 40 years ago. The acting is poor, the characters are not interesting and the only good part is some of the dialogue. Still that is not going to save a movie so halfway in, I had enough and turned it off.",1343692800,2,253,3.980392156862745
5167181,5,B008I84692,"Deadline is based on a true story of the uninvestigated murder of a black teenager in a small Southern town. It's a compelling, powerful movie that makes you realize that the suffering caused by ignorance and racism can be so completely pervasive as to poison an entire community.

The payoff comes when someone finally cares enough to investigate and bring the guilty to justice. The final scenes, where the truth finally comes out, are both shocking and redemptive.

Ultimately, Deadline is about hope. Unfathomable hope. Hope that is finally rewarded.",1343001600,,554,5.144444444444445
5167182,2,B008I84692,"I'm shocked at the good reviews for this movie. It was worse that a bad TV movie. Horrible acting, bizarre choices for music and a poor choice for the scenes where it was used. Everything about this was a cliche' and I ended up using it as background noise toward the end when I realized there was nothing that would redeem it. Seriously - don't waste your time or money on this one - it was just plain bad.",1342828800,2,407,4.1645569620253164
5167183,4,B008I84692,"As independent movies go, this one is pretty good. There are moments of unintentional humor due to some acting/writing/editing, but that gives the movie some of its charm.  I understand they used many local (Nashville area) actors/actresses. Some are quite exceptional, and some are less so, but overall the quality is good. It is certainly worth an hour and a half to rent or buy.",1342656000,,381,4.861538461538461
5167184,5,B008I84692,'Deadline' is a movie about a young person determined to investigate the unsolved murder of an African American child twenty years ago. It's a compelling story and must see drama that will grip you from start to finish!,1342569600,,219,4.7894736842105265
