8269904,5,B0018KKQBY,"Great hand-drawn animation, intelligent plot, and hd. This release does have english audio. It is a Honneamise release, as was the Akira blu ray. And like Akira, when the disc first boots-up, it gives you a choice of japanese menus and audio or english menus and audio. Also you can switch while viewing like any other blu ray. It's pretty expensive, but I got mine a little cheaper than they are now. Don't let the subtitles only label fool you.",1333324800,7,446,4.5875
