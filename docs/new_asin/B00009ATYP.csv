8277829,1,B00009ATYP,"I have spent more than two weeks on line looking for John Farnham discs in an NTSC format. John is an Australian. ALL is DVDs are PAL format. I repeat,ALL his DVDs are PAL. Amazon shows the Classic Jack DVD as NTSC--not so. I ordered Classic Jack and that began my journey to find John in an American format. NOPE- you need a player with a PAL to NTSC converter built into it. I will guarentee this disc is PAL. Amazon refused to change the ad to reflect the PAL format based on just my call. I posted the info online under Classic Jack review. Immediately, another customer confirmed the disc he got was also PAL. So-don't order this unless you can play a PAL disc. Due to this I have not seen this DVD. But, I will guarentee you that if you like good singers, John will not disappoint. In my own opinion, John has one of the best voices in the world. I don't say that lightly. I have been in the music business and I have seen alot of people come and go. John has been ""the voice"" in Australia for over 30 years. Beside his solo career he was also the lead voice for Little River Band in the early 80's. One of the finest harmony bands ever put together. If you like amazing talent, but yourself a DVD player with PAL capabilities. It would definately be worth it.",1202428800,,1266,4.2139917695473255
