7839488,5,6303123309,"This is a very good beginning salsa video.  Excellent verbal instructions by Kenny Ortega & Miranda Garrison.  I't the oldest salsa video I own & I've used it often for showing new salseros some good basic techniques.  I love the clothes, too bad it is no longer the fashion because the clothes really look good & make the lady's hip action really hot.",1018915200,2,352,4.555555555555555
7839489,3,6303123309,"This was the first Salsa instructional video on the market as far as I know. Has been hard to find for years. I have been waiting a decade to watch this video.
The cover says it is a promotional copy not for sale? If you can get over the clothes & the white socks this is not a bad beginners video. The styling is over the top for today but some of the moves are nice. Has the best shoulder shakes performance in a video so far. Some of the ladies styling was very good. If you liked the movie buy it. On 2 count for the moves. There is one advanced move I like when they are freestyling at the end.",1016755200,3,599,3.918032786885246
