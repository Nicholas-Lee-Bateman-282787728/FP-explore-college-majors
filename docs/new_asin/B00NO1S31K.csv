Special effects weren't bad either.  So, if you want raunchy language and a bunch of sex then I would not watch this film.

Obviously the whole budget was blown on the space scenes and left none for visual affects or quality script editors or they could have had a decent movie above 3 stars.
I like Sorbo but they short changed him on screen time.
Any how its a one shot movie.  i don't feel i wasted my time as it kept me interested enough to watch all of it but won't watch it again.",1415232000,6,584,4.15929203539823

6673266,3,B00NO1S31K,"This movie should be called ""Snipers 2"".... in space. Well, actually on a planet. Well, actually, on Earth, with a few still shots of some double planets in the sky for special effects. Poor Kevin Sorbo gets a few scenes in a small orbital command center set, with a few lines, and that's about it. I like him (Hercules, Andromeda, excellent shows), but this looks like something he did on a lunch break.  He barks a few orders, then says ""call me when something happens"", and disappears off set to get a snack or go to the bathroom, something, I'm not sure. Now, the main character is a Sniper on the planet, with the rifle, the ghillie suit, the whole deal. It's a slow pace movie with him battling some, uh, aliens, that look just like us, only they have bright blue eyes (maybe they had some SPICE). There is some action, through typical fight scenes and shooting scenes (you know the kind, 40 bullets and ray guns and no one hits anything). He ends up saving a (slave girl? Princess? Royalty? it's not clear) who hangs with him. The second Sniper shows up later in the movie (don't want to spoil anything there). There is also one bad guy who is sort of his opposite, a sniper of sorts, who seems to be hunting our main character down, but he has a role to play during the film. I give it 3 stars because the Sniper guy can act and he carried the movie, and the story is not that bad, though not well written. More dialog would have helped. Was it Scifi? Barely.  This really is a One Shot, because that's about how many times you'll watch it.",1413244800,27,1548,4.334482758620689
6673267,3,B00NO1S31K,"Sadly I didn't review this when it was still on Amazon Prime otherwise it would have shown Verified Purchase.

Kevin Sorbo doesn't really star in this movie.  He's there, of course, but in the role of a Captain aboard a spaceship above where the real action is.  Matthew Reese plays Kyle Matthews (hmm, I wonder if they did that to make it easy for the actor to remember who his character was), a Special Forces type of guy who had been inserted into a planet of humanoid type characters with designs on conquering Earth - well, that design only happened after humans decided THEY needed that planet for their own.

Sorbo, Commander Gibson, who can only watch Matthews through long range viewing can only see Matthews when he comes out of the ditches and channels.  Matthews observes a local taking a woman to one of the channels, shots her and leaves her for dead.  Eventually Matthews checks the body.  What he finds is that the woman is still alive.  He patches her up and takes him back to his lair.  Thus begins Matthews journey for savage killer to an understanding person.

This isn't a bad movie but by no means is it a great one.  It catches up to you eventually and you finally become engrossed in it enough to watch it all the way through.  If, for some reason, you quit watching early, you'll be unlikely to return to it.",1451606400,,1333,4.485477178423237

6673273,2,B00NO1S31K,"This ""movie"" appears to be essentially two films combined (a short one containing Sorbo edited into the longer Sci-Fi combat film).  Think of the 1956 version of the 1954 original of Godzilla (Gojira?); same difference.  It might not have been an okay guilty pleasure movie, but the producers had no confidence in the film so they added Ken Sorbo to mix, in a rather inexpensive set, and gave him a script which he did as well as can be expected.

With all the futility of war and man's inhumanity to alien spread through this piece, along with 'Dune' like aliens (blue eyes and all) it was just dumb.

6673288,4,B00NO1S31K,"ONE SHOT

I got this movie because Kevin Sorbo was in it and I am a fan so I had to have it. So after picking it up I headed to my brothers house that weekend for our next little movie marathon. This was the second flick on the menu that night. As it turned out it was a pretty good flick. Far from the best but really good Sci-Fi military type movie, it is about snipers after all.

A battle is raging out in space between us humans and another race from another planet. During one battle various people are shot down. One of those happens to be a man named Kyle Matthews and he is a sniper. Now he is stuck on an alien planet with the enemy all around him, whats worse is his own people cant get to him. Things get worse when a woman is left for dead but she is one of the aliens. Should he help her or leave her be, also who else could be out there, watching?

Now this is a good movie but it feels like two different movies mashed into one. We have the sniper story that could have fit right into that film series; it also kinda reminds me of the excellent Enemy at the Gates. This part which is the majority is the best part of the flick. Then we have the space station thing that we cut to from time to time just to have people say they are watching him but cant send help yet. Unfortunately this is the only part with Kevin Sorbo although he does appear throughout; he is also the best thing about these scenes.

This film was directed by John Lyde who also directed the Kevin Sorbo film Survivor and the zombie flick Ozombie. I think he did a really good job on this film particularly the sniper stuff on the planet. The acting was hit or miss but always entertaining. And the writing was great B movie stuff thanks to Adam Abram which could be bad if you aren't into this type of stuff. You only get the trailer on the DVD; I would have loved a commentary track on this flick. Over all I thought it was a good enough B flick that would have made a much better straight up sniper film.",1430697600,5,1993,4.050761421319797

6673290,1,B00NO1S31K,"First, few words to the fans of Kevin Sorbo: Don't hold your breath. In this movie, Mr. Sorbo has a supporting role and his character could be omitted, removed from the movie/plot altogether and nobody would notice the difference. The same can be said about a bunch of other characters in this movie. And the title is misleading, really. Some might call It ""Shoot, shoot, shoot, then repeat."" And I wonder if it's just me or other viewers also got the feeling of watching a movie about a hero American special ops officer ""of German-Scandinavian descent"" fighting in Afganistan? In my opinion, there are much better movies about our troops fighting that war than this poorly made sci-fi spiced-up flick.",1429920000,7,703,4.866666666666666
