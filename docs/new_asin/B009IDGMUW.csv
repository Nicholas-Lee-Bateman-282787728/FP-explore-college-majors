5339832,4,B009IDGMUW,"Harold Arlen's score is a knockout with one great song after another.  And the young Barbara Cook is a joy (she thinks she looks awful in this--hairdo issues--I think she looks almost as delicious as she sounds).  The book creaks (North South civil war stuff), and the whole affair wobbles between operetta and musical comedy, but oh that wonderful score and oh Barbara Cook.",1373328000,3,375,4.84375
5339833,3,B009IDGMUW,"This has value as a record of the young Barbara Cook, in fine voice..  The black and white print has been transferred without any digital improvement, so is far from 'high def"".  The musical has obviously been truncated to fit within the broadcast time allowed by its initial television transmission.  Even Agnes De Mille's choreography seems to be an afterthought, disappointing for such an eminent  choreographer.
I would recommend this DVD only as an historical curiosity for die hard lovers of musical theatre.",1369699200,3,514,5.156626506024097
5339834,4,B009IDGMUW,"Shows it age--both in the show itself and the production--but historically signficant for preserving a visual of a classic score/show.  And how wodnerful to see a young Barbara Cook in action.

5339835,4,B009IDGMUW,"Placing this video in context is a little like trying to reconstruct a vanished
civilization from artefacts. It brings us back to a time when Broadway musicals
were central in American life. Everyone knew about them, went to them, played the
records...and saw them revived almost every week on television. The showings were
cut way down from the original Broadway running time, but they featured the kind of
performers who were working prominently on Broadway in this era--Barbara Cook was
about to go into Plain and Fancy and then The Music Man, and Keith Andes was in
between replacing Alfred Drake in Kiss Me, Kate and playing opposite Lucille Ball
in Wildcat. And Agnes de Mille was recreating two of her Bloomer Girl dances, the
one following ""It Was Good Enough For Grandma"" and the famous Civil War Ballet.
So this tape brings us back to a longlost time. The cutdown script is not so
great, but what's left of the score is wonderful, and everyone plays with authentic
style. The CD might be a better bet because the songs are so good. And there are
quite a lot of them, too--the original 78 set was one of the longest of the 1940s.
But most customers will probably want a full-scale performance, albeit cut way
back from the original.",1360972800,6,1241,4.671232876712328
5339836,5,B009IDGMUW,"I couldn't disagree more with J.A.Newcomer's negative review.  I, too, had heard these songs for years and to finally see the show they came from - and to see how topical it still is - was amazing.  Barbara Cook is wonderful in the title role, as is Keith Andes.  It's sad that certain numbers had be be cut, but we still get many of the songs performed wonderfully - ""Evalina"" and ""Right As The Rain"" are standouts.  Agnes deMille's ballet doesn't fit with the rest of the piece (it's deadly serious while the rest of the show is a lot of fun), but it's great to see it recreated so faithfully and to finally hear Arlen's beautiful ballet music performed in full.

If you've ever wanted to see this show, or just want to see a wondeful, forgotten gem, get this DVD!",1358899200,3,766,4.366197183098592
5339837,2,B009IDGMUW,"i didn't know much about 'bloomer girl' beyond the cast album and the idea that barbara cook had done a tv version.
for me, this disc was a big disappointment. the book - which dealt with strong themes was whittled down to comic book
strength...and length.  to be fair, tv was not very sophisticated in the 1950s but no one comes out of this production looking well. if there's one exception it might be brock peters. the agnes de mille choreography made me realize how limited her work
was. it was fun to see and hear ms. cook as a young and slim woman i suppose it has a place in the theatre/musical comedy
section of my collection but i doubt i'll be playing it again.",1356912000,6,671,4.325396825396825
5339838,5,B009IDGMUW,"This is the latest in the recent series of musicals that were adapted for television in the 1950s being released by VAI Video. The productions are ""condensed"" versions - which include the ""hits"" - squeezing a two-hour show into 60-70 minutes PLUS commercials. Musically, this is my favorite so far.

If you found this review by searching Amazon you probably know something about the musical so I won't go into too much detail about it but will concentrate on the DVD release. Briefly, the 1944 musical takes place in a ""hoop skirt factory"" on the eve of the Civil War. It's about women's rights, slavery and racism - topics that composers Harold Arlen and ""Yip"" Harburg turn into wonderful songs. The big hit here is ""The Eagle and Me"" sung beautifully by Rawn Spearman. Spearman gets to sing again, along with two fellow African Americans (including actor Brock Peters - here listed as ""Broc"" in the credits) for ""I Got A Song"", a song new to me but beautifully performed. Barbara Cook and Keith Anders are the romantic leads and in great voice. Another reason that this broadcast is important is that the dances choreographed by Agnes De Mille for the Broadway production are re-staged for television by De Mille utilizing some of the principal dances from the Broadway production 15 years earlier.

This is a BLACK& WHITE kinescope of the show that aired on ""Producers Showcase"" in 1956. Because a kinescope is a film of a TV image it is never as sharp as a direct film. In this case the image is clean (no dust marks or scratches) but the contrast is not as high as you might hope for. I do not have an HD TV so can't tell what it'll look like on that. (My TV is 33-year-old 27 inch Sony). But the sound is great! As they did on the last release VAI has excised the commercials (about 9 minutes) for Ford/Mercury and RCA/RCA Victor and added them as bonuses. (I really enjoyed the RCA ones for both ""portable TVs"" - remember those? - and a portable 45rpm record player plus a ""trade in sale"" on TVs - which, BTW, were selling for $199.99 in those days).

The show is - of course - an edited version of the 1944 play but much of the music and dances are here.

The DVD includes a 4 page foldout which uses two pages to advertise other VAI releases, while providing the full credits and a detailed ""chapter listing"" (there are 29) so that you can return to specific songs. A nice touch.

The only wish I would have about these VAI releases of musicals from 1950s TV is that they would add a commentary track - or at least a separate ""introduction"" using one of the many musical theater experts around. It would give audiences who are unfamiliar with the shows (especially younger audiences) some background. I don't know what this would cost them, but it would make these releases even more valuable artifacts.

I really enjoyed this production and can't wait to see what VAI has ""in the wings"". It's a must for any Broadway theater collector.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8541826,3,B009IDGMUW,"I really didn't like it, though it was very well done.  It was a chance to see Barbara Cook in a show.  Typical E. Y. Harburg preaching (even though I agreed with the sermon).  His rhymes are trite, his sense of humor doesn't exist, and he has almost no imagination.  Not great Harold Arlen either, I didn't think.  Harburg is no Larry Hart - the bad lyrics bothered me the most.  The guy who played the runaway slave was very good.  So were the guys in jail.  Oh.  And I hated the obvious, labored point of the Sunday in Cicero Falls number. Finian's Rainbow was a lot better, I thought.",1503619200,,588,4.2727272727272725

8541829,5,B009IDGMUW,"The television version of ""Bloomer Girl"", recorded in the Fifties, manages to capture the feel of a Broadway show, although its sets are a bit more realistic.  The use of a camera, of course, gives the show a cinematic touch.  However, in those days, viewers who loved the shows, welcomed, I'm sure, the wide accessibility television provided to the script, music, lyrics, and the talents that form the delightful core of the stage production.  The tv version of the show substitutes the young Barbara Cook for the original Celeste Holmes, but Miss Cook's voice is a special pleasure.  It's a joy to realize that her sweet, clear soprano is still around.  Some might even remember other members of this version from other shows: Brock Peters from  ""Lost in the Stars"", and Carmen Matthews from ""Porgy and Bess"".  Arlen's music and Harburg's lyrics still shine, and Agnes DeMille's choreography is classic in the American musical theater.",1433462400,,937,5.006451612903226

8541831,5,B009IDGMUW,"Just WHO is this young girl by the name of BARBARA COOK?
What a JOY it is to see a young Barbara Cook singing her soul out in this rickety vehicle.
The video is of a 1955 B&W Video broadcast, in an array of studio environments that have been assembled at great expense to present this musical, that originally starred Celeste Holm after her appearing in ""OKLAHOMA"" of 1945.  Costumes were then by Miles White, which have been recreated for this musical broadcast.  It is interesting to watch, just for the early use of roving TV cameras to film the moving action.
It is dated, but the performers are all great in their performances, . . . BUT to see Barbara Cook at the beginning of her career, is like being given a ""birthday present"", when you are turning six-years-old, with a chocolate cake, white frosting, and vanilla ice-cream!",1406592000,,834,4.590604026845638
8541832,5,B009IDGMUW,"Ever since I saw a production of Bloomer Girl in 1981, this has been one musical I've longed to see again. Thanks to VAI, I finally did, and it certainly didn't disappoint. The songs are great, as is the story, and the acting in this production is superb. A terrific addition to my collection. As a side note, the review I did for A Connecticut Yankee mentioned it includes the original commercials. Forget that, I was a bit feeble minded when I wrote that part, this DVD has the commercials.",1392508800,,492,4.477777777777778
8541833,3,B009IDGMUW,"Like the ""new"" Oz touring the country, when the cast started singing the Arlen/Harburg score there was magic for the ears. This was one of the first Broadway shows I saw, Fritz the doorman at the Shubert Theatre would baby sit for me while my father was upstairs  across the street with J.J. He would later walk me in to see ""Can-Can"", ""Pipe Dream"" and many other shows while he was at that theatre. What a thrill it was to work at the theatre, alas, only for 2 weeks with a Gore Vidal show, ""An Evening With Richard Nixon"". I was also put into the second balcony of the St. James, there was a door from J.J.'s office, later Merricks, into the theatre, where I got to see ""Oklahoma"" many times. If you sense I'm trying to evade this ""Bloomer Girl"", well, you're right. While it has many wonderful moments going for it, like the Civil War Ballet(why hasn't there ever been an ""Agnes DeMille Broadway""? Talk about reshaping the Broadway musical), there is something major missing. And, though I love Miss Cook, what's missing is Celeste Holm. Listen to the CD of Celeste ""Even the rabbits inhabit their habitants"". So while this production has a lot going for it and it's nice to have a record of a show that will probably never be seen in a revival, I have to think of what I saw on stage at the Shubert back in the 40's",1391904000,,1319,4.361788617886178
