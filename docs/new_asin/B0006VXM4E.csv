2196575,5,B0006VXM4E,"Dark Shadows 17 wraps up the 1897 storyline and the Leviathan storyline begins! My only complaint about the 1897 storyline is that Magda wasn't used more towards the end or in the final struggle with Count Petofi.

I have heard some people disliked the Leviathan storyline, but I really enjoy the nice change of pace from the 1897 storyline. The Leviathan storyline is mysterious, creepy and weird (all good things)! I also enjoy Barnabas being evil again, with Julia working to put the pieces together.

It's also great to have Marie Wallace and Dennis Patrick (who played the slimy Jason McGuire) back in the cast.

A few bloopers to look out for (with spoilers): The window falls apart in a scene with Charity and Tate (either DS 16 or 17 set), Maggie Evans trips going up the stairs, a stage hand is seen pouring dry ice on the set while the credits rolls. Also there is no way one of the items could have fit into the Leviathan box!

2196577,1,B0006VXM4E,"It's amazing I'm the only one that seems to be displeased with MPI's shoddy packaging of the Dark Shadows series. I have had to send for replacements of my DVD sets countless times throughout the past couple of months. I don't like the way they cram the DVDs in frail holders which constantly has resulted in the tabs coming loose & falling in the case. The tabs which contain the DVDs are NOT secure & I've been discovering more & more that there are usually a couple of tabs missing.

I LOVE Dark Shadows & have been very pleased with the packaging & care put into collections 1-14. Unfortunately MPI seems to have laxed since then & have shown little regard for how they package & market these sets. The trouble had began with volume 15 onwards & I've been having trouble ever since. DVDs become dislodged & slide back & forth within the case due to their ever-broken holder tabs. I can't tell you how many discs have been badly scratched on account of this! This is NOT a result of the DVDs journey to me, it's most certainly due to MPI.

I read that Amazon had discontinued their line of volumes 1-8 from (Dark Shadows) *The Beginning* series for awhile (they've since started issuing them again) as customers complaints were very similar to mine of the inferior care put in to their DVD sets.

I'm very upset that MPI is cheap in their care of marketing these sets & felt compelled to pass my experience with this matter along to others who may be experiencing the same trouble.",1266278400,6,1484,4.488888888888889
2196578,5,B0006VXM4E,"Dark Shadows remains my favorite television show.  I watched it years ago but never got to see all of it because I was going to school when it was on.  Now that I am a senior, I have purchased the DVD's and totally got hooked once again.  I highly recommend the entire run.",1264550400,,273,4.113207547169812
2196579,5,B0006VXM4E,"A wonderfully addictive program- and if you're reading this, you're probably as addicted to Dark Shadows as I am. However, the interview with George DiCenzo has got to go- this man is hyper arrogant and self obsessed and is probably one of the most sickening examples of self glorification I have ever seen. His self promoting diatribes are painful to watch. Why doesn't Count Petofi silence this guy?",1248134400,,401,4.911764705882353
2196580,5,B0006VXM4E,"If you're on vol. 17, it's probably safe to say you're familiar with the Dark Shadows set-up. I guess this is as close as I'll ever come to the acid flashbacks the CIA promised me for all those years. More of the same, glorious, same.  An actor's wet dream; a viewer's too. Just remember, Count Petofi ISN'T REALLY WHO HE SEEMS!!

2196582,5,B0006VXM4E,"These four discs are so hot they scream play me over!  From this amazing serial these are some of the wicked and twisted highlights.  Figuring out who is posessing this character in this time period while backstabbing the young man that now has his old eccentric gypsy body - and all the complicated motivations - this is a television joy ride.  Until ""Lost"" - nothing on television ever commanded so much viewer faith.  The writer's took an icredibly large story arc and created an amazing and absorbing, time traveling, supernaturally romantic story - this set has some of the best episodes.",1148342400,7,593,4.841584158415841
2196583,5,B0006VXM4E,"This box set, representing 40 episodes of the fabulous gothic soap opera Dark Shadows ironically concludes one of its most popular story arcs and begins one of its least popular ones.

For many episodes the core cast of the series has been portraying their own relatives and other characters in the Collinwood of 1897, after Barnabas Collins goes back in time using secrets from the mystical Chinese practice of the I Ching, or Book of Changes. Barnabas travelled back in time to save young David Collins living in modern-day (1960s) Collinwood who was being menanced by the ghost of Quentin Collins.

The introduction of Quentin, portrayed brillantly by David Selby, was a high mark for the show and rejuvinated its fan base. The story involving Quentin has all of the elements that made Dark Shadows a true classic, resulting in these DVD releases of its five-year run --- the only soap opera in history to have such treatment.

The plot revolved around Quentin and a werewolf curse that was placed on him by a grieving gypsy, Magda Rocozzi (portrayed with memorable gusto in an Emmy-calibre performance by Grayson Hall), who blamed him for the death of her sister who was Quentin's wife. The plot became more complicated with the arrival of the sinister Count Andres Petoffi (also protrayed with brilliance by core cast member Thayer David), who possessed supernatural powers and was being hunted by the gypsies.

To escape the gypsy threat forever, Petoffi, whose power primarily rested in one of his hands, plotted to travel to the year 1969, from whence Barnabas came, after forcibly switching bodies through supernatural means with Quentin.

In this box set of episodes, Petoffi is foiled and is apparently killed in a fire during a life-and-death struggle with the ghost of the warden of Dartmore Prison, who Petoffi brought to life to successfully dispatch his former servant, Aristede.

The witch Angelique, portrayed by Lara Parker, who placed the curse of the vampire on Barnabas 100 years prior, actually helps him defeat Petoffi in episodes included in this box set.

Quentin, whose curse is being held at bay by a supernatural portrait of himself, leaves Collinwood and moves to New York City to join his love, Amanda Harris. He is earlier devastated by the accidental death of Beth Chavez who falls from Widows' Hill when fleeing from Quentin whom she erroneously believed was Petoffi.

Barnabas, who goes back farther in time to prevent the death of the love of his life, Josette, is suddenly captured by two robbed figures representing the Loviathan people who appear with an altar that depict a multi-headed serpent called the Naga.

Thus begins a story line that will consume far too many episodes. Similar to Damien in the Omen, Dark Shadows ends up with its own demon seed, an inhuman being that grows to adulthood in weeks and can change from man to beast and represents pure evil. The story introduces actor Chris Pennock, who portrays the adult demon, and who stays with the show playing other characters until its cancellation.

This box set also brings back talented character actor Dennis Patrick, who had earlier in the series protrayed Jason McGuire, a ""friend"" of the long-lost husband of the show's matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by famed movie actress Joan Bennett.) In the classic Dark Shadows' tradition of a notable cast twist, Patrick now portrays that long-lost husband, Paul Stoddard!",1112918400,33,3438,5.015789473684211

One day my child-care provider introduced the series to me and I was hooked ever since. Never, had I known or seen the ending, so this is my chance to see it all over again with a more understanding of the series. Because of these DVDs, I was able to attend my first Dark Shadow Festival in Brooklyn, NY, the year before Jonathan Frid past.  I got to meet Lara Parker, David Selby, Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Roger Davis, and many others because of these DVD's. Thanks Amazon.",1388793600,,632,4.3931623931623935

2196600,5,B0006VXM4E,"Petofi's plans fail, due to his perceived betrayal. Blackwood, the hunter for Aristede, is conjured into life through one of Tate's drawings. Charity Trask's revolt against her preacher father becomes more self-realized, as she becomes more and more ""Pansy Faye"". Aristede's days are numbered... As are Trask's! (YAY for Judith for thinking of a way to dispense of him!! haa haa!) Remember that skeleton in the West Wing?

Kitty, the reincarnation of Josette, has become a gold-digging bimbo. With Barnabus, they are sucked back into the 1700's. Barnabus goes into a limbo, and is doomed to the roam the Everlasting eternal realities of the parallel dimensions, ""Kitty, Kitty""!!

I really like Katherine Leigh-Scott, Nancy Barrett and Jonathan Frid in these various role plays. Joan Bennett is privately hilarious! The end sequences of this collection take a dramatic turn in tone. I DO like the haunted antique shop! Barnabus becomes markedly different, conspiring in his return to present-time 1969.

2196602,5,B0006VXM4E,I HAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL IN THE 60'S AND ALSO BOUGHT ALL OF THE VHS TAPES.  NOW I AM UPGRADING TO DVD AND CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND OR QUALITY OF THIS ON DVD.,1322524800,,171,3.6216216216216215
2196603,5,B0006VXM4E,"The episodes in this set of four DVD's wraps up the 1897 drama as the evil Count Petofi switches bodies with Quentin so that he'll have a host body to accept him in 1969 (it is too complicate to try to explain). Believe it or not, Angelique does the right thing and tries to help Quentin (does she truly love him?), but the one to really finish the Count off is another of the drawing come to life creations of painter Charles Delaware Tate. Judith Collins plots revenge against her double dealing husband Reverend Trask with the most delightful results and finally answers the puzzle of the hidden room in the west wing. Loved it!

Lady Kitty faces the most difficult battle of her life as the spirit of Josette Collins tries to claim her and be with her beloved Barnabas - culminating in Barnabas being sent once again to 1795 to stop Josette from her infamous jump from Widows Hill - but he's captured by two mysterious beings and this is where everyone returns to the present and a new story arc begins - the People of the Leviathan. Only the last set of episodes deal with this story, and I don't recall much of it from the first time around but I think there's going to be a spin on Rosemary's Baby or something similar. Time will tell.

I loved this set, and while I was ready for the 1897 story to wrap up, I'm going to miss it. David Selby is superb as always, but Nancy Barrett really stole the show as Charity Trask possessed by the spirit of showgirl Pansy Fay. Looooooooool when she flicked her skirts at the very very Reverend Trask. Kathryn Leigh Scott really rocked as Josette/Lady Kitty switching from one persona to the next in seconds. Nicely done.  As always, Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall are the consummate professionals, and Lara Parker rules as Angelique - really liked seeing a sympathetic side to her in this story.

I've noticed comments about the packaging of these DVD's. I've been getting them from the library and some have the nice sturdy black colored binder with the sleeves inside on a ring binder (as this one was) and others were of a white binder with much less sturdy sleeve holders - and ones that leave the DVD's at risk of coming loose and bounced about. If you have a choice of packaging I'd definitely pick the black one.",1312675200,,2266,4.479418886198547
