3895368,5,B002BUQJZM,"I am a novice in the area of Yoga and meditation. Purchased this DVD as it had a guided meditation section.

This DVD is of two parts.
1. A detailed and interesting talk by the author on Yoga and meditation. He shares quite a few interesting anecdtoes, which really help us think and guide us on how we should change our perspectives from the immediate near to a pragmatic and unattached view. These anecdotes though funny have very profound messages.
2. The guided meditation section. This is a 24 minute portion, which I found to be of immense help. It helps us meditate better as it guides us in a very calm and peaceful tone. The counting for the breathing exercise was also very helpful.

I would recommend this product for all beginners who need help in the very crtical initial pahse of setting up a discipline to practice.

3895369,5,B002BUQJZM,"I have this video and it is excellent!

It is for the serious student of Consciousness Awakening through Yoga and Meditation, but it can be exceptionally useful as well for the beginner.

In exploring the pathways to the next level of who we are and why we're here, we're all beginners.  The lessons of this video can only advance us.

Sunder is an exceptional teacher combining technique with understanding with well told stories.  Sunder's stories are of enormous usefulness.

And adding to all that has been expressed above, one last ingredient, Sunder's credibility, as a teacher, as a man and as an evolving spirit.

3895370,5,B002BUQJZM,"I have been a student of Meditation for decades and I find Sunder Iyer's DVD succinct in explaining the fundamentals of Yoga and Meditation.
He explains his background, his mastery of the subject matter is self- evident.
The  presentation is very well done one frame flows into the next.
I certainly look forward to future sequels of these kernels of knowledge.
I'm sure Dr Iyers efforts in bringing this pristine knowledge within the grasp of the beginner will do us all a world of good.
I personally have benefitted tremendously and would highly recommend this DVD to anyone seeking a clear and concise understanding of this subject.

3895371,5,B002BUQJZM,This is an excellent introduction to meditation.  Dr. Iyer is down-to-earth in his approach but yet he covered all the principles of yoga and meditation. The visuals are excellent.  I look forward to the future DVD from Dr. Iyer.  Kudos!,1248739200,,237,4.875
3895372,5,B002BUQJZM,"After looking around for a long time and reading about it in Libraries, Silent Rythms is what I was looking for. I am a novice in Meditation and Yoga. Other than books, other video options are priced out of my pockets.

Dr. Sundar provides a quite a lot of information for beginners to work with.
The best part of the video is the ease with which it can be understood and put into practice for beginners. I have been following up with the video on the asanas along with the meditations and already feel like a yogi !!

Dr. Sundar, eagerly awaiting your follow up on this...",1248134400,,573,4.345794392523365
3895373,5,B002BUQJZM,"This is outstanding.  The workmanship in the mechanics and Dr. Iyer's delivery leave nothing to be desired in my estimation.
Dr. Iyer has taken what has always been a mystifying subject for me and simplified it.  Dr. Iyer is obviously a master in the art of meditation and yoga.  He makes the subject understandable and easy to follow in his instructions.  He is soothing to listen to especially in the practice segment.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in yoga and meditation and/or just in calming oneself from the stresses of life and obtaining a peaceful demeanor.",1247616000,,581,4.887755102040816
3895374,5,B002BUQJZM,"This video is beautifully put together.  Clear instructions, making the what, why, and how very understandable to us novices; yet it leaves a lot of room for personalizing your experience.  Both I and my youngest daughter (who's 17) highly recommend it!",1246060800,,253,5.146341463414634
3895375,5,B002BUQJZM,"I love this DVD and great one for learning Meditation thru yoga,
I had never done Yoga before and I was afraid to go to the gym and look like an idiot. I picked up this DVD and it is awesome. Dr Iyer is very good in describing each pose and how to perform it properly without being overbearing. I have tried many meditation videos and dvds over the years, and this is by far the best one I have ever used.",1245974400,,405,3.951219512195122
3895376,5,B002BUQJZM,"This DVD is absolutely ""AWESOME"". I have praticed Yoga with Dr. Iyer for a few weeks and immediately enjoyed his class. He makes it so clear and easy to understand. I have praticed in the past with other instructors but never felt so comfortable. This DVD is especially great for beginners. I highly recommend!! Makes a great gift too :-) It's nice when you can learn to view things differently and in a more positive way through something so simple...Dr. Iyer helps you to realize that.",1245715200,,487,4.674418604651163

Explanation of what is meditation , why we should do and how to do are very well done and easy to understand and easy to practice. This DVD made the meditation easy and easy to practice.

3895378,5,B002BUQJZM,"If you are a novice to the world of Yoga/Meditation and wondering how to make the first step, don't go anywhere, get this DVD.

This is a great start. Sundar explains what is Meditation/Yoga by using simple words and by telling simple stories, that you could relate to easily and appreciate the content/context immediately.

Pros:
1. DVD content is very well organized - the chapters, the way the speaker takes you step by step.
2. Speaker's voice modulation, body language are smooth & good.
3. Examples- pictures, videos are good.

Overall presentation is commendable.

Cons:
1. Pbly I was too eager to learn more yoga postures..was little disappointed to see only 2 or 3 yoga postures. My bad.

I will give 5 stars.

Sundar, I am awaiting for your next DVD release.",1245110400,2,768,4.78030303030303
3895379,5,B002BUQJZM,"This DVD is a great introduction to the what, why and how of meditation through yoga.  There is something worthwhile in this DVD for both the novice and those that are more advanced in the practice of meditation and yoga.  I was looking for something that was useful in explaining what meditation/yoga are and gave practical advice on how to go about learning to practice them daily.  This video covers both.

The DVD is divided into two parts.

Part 1 -
What is meditation
Why do we meditate
How to meditate

Part 2 -
Practice Session

What I liked so much about this video is how it was structured.  Sunder starts off by presenting his background which lends credibility to the points that he raises.  This has been a way of life for him since his childhood in India, and he has spent many years practicing what he preaches. Despite his level of experience with meditation and yoga, he makes it understandable and accessible to all.  Through personal stories and analogies, Sunder helps you get a better grasp of what meditation is and what it is not (i.e., it is not magic).  It's about stripping off our limited and learned perceptions to 'Just Be'.  Be perceptive of the moment.

Beyond expanding our perceptions, Sunder explains how the principles of meditation/yoga can be used to enrich every part of our daily lives.  I think that he is very effective at taking ideas/concepts that can be abstract at times and helping you connect to them through practical explanations and demonstrations.  For example, I've never before heard anyone expain, quite the way he does, the reasoning behind how you sit to meditate (i.e., the positioning of your arms, legs, etc...).  Step by step he instructs you on the hows and whys for doing things certain ways.  He presents the philosophy of Raja yoga using three principles and illustrates those principles by introducing you to balancing poses and meditation sitting positions.  There is also a focus on breath awareness and breathing techniques to help center the mind.

If part one of this video gives you the foundations of meditation through yoga, part two gives you the opportunity to start putting the techniques into practice.  Overall, I highly recommend this video for its ability to help you better understand meditation/yoga and to connect that understanding to its practical application in your everyday life.",1244851200,8,2367,4.899497487437186

8361959,5,B002BUQJZM,"I got this DVD from Sundar Iyer himself recently at one of his speeches at one of the devotional programs in our area (Cincinnati). I have just watched this DVD today and from the first viewing itself, I have been able to experience a kind of joy and calmness that I have never achieved so far in my life. I took up to watching this DVD just because I was so depressed before I took it up and wanted to calm my mind down. Now after watching this DVD, I am so much encouraged to follow up on the practice session that this DVD offers and do it everyday in my quest to BE MYSELF and be what I am rather than BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE. Thank you Sundar Iyer for this wonderful DVD. I recommend that everyone who wants to explore their inner self and find the calmness and peace in their life should have this DVD.",1259971200,,805,4.10126582278481
