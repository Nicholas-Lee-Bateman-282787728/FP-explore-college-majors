8227809,5,B000XBT7KA,"A band clearly ahead of it's time - not just for Christian bands, but all rock bands (something apparently not lost on them - witness their video for ""All Over Me"" - nor to Oakley, who I understand was a sponsor for the band [check out the shades... crazy]).  A futuristic sound, fearless in using technology & techniques, distortion, static, whatever, but used seamlessly and masterfully in the production and delivery of their sound.  I'd love to get ahold of one or both of their song books (for untitled and/or contact).  These guys deserve a tribute band (a reunion of the band would be better)...",1396051200,,602,4.714285714285714
