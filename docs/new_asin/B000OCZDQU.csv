If you're looking for a step by step journey thru a long and interesting 3d model lesson you are going to me like me, Massively disappointed. As a level 2 product it feels very level 1 still and at times a little insulting. You never really get into any serious tutorials at least nothing that I didn't know already. If you think that you're going to be doing the project that's on the cover of the disk case, well hold on to your pants because you're NOT! There's really nothing here that I couldn't of gotten off of some random Youtube videos.  To be honest I never even copied the projects off the disk because they were that uninteresting. I also had trouble playing this disk on several Mac machines so beware. So do yourself a favor and save your money and shame on you go-to-school.com. This is a subpar product. It looks like you spent more time on the interface than you did on the content.",1353024000,,978,4.433333333333334
8184627,5,B000OCZDQU,"This is about as close to having a private Workshop/Seminar in your own home as you can get. Play the DVD on the TV, use Sketchup on your computer simultaneously. When it comes to TIME EFFECTIVENESS, this DVD destroys any workbook. I have Level One, Level Two, subscribe to the FREE Podcasts, and love them all. I hope they produce an Advanced Level 3 DVD.",1217721600,6,356,4.492307692307692
