8572300,1,B000LMPN8G,"This is not a film.  They show you pictures changing in a sequence for about 1 hour!  Buy only if you enjoy photography.  Even if this is the case, you may not enjoy this DVD, because the sequence is random: a mix of nature (about 75%) and urban (about 25%) landscapes with no connection to each other, and many shots, in my opinion, are worthless.",1174089600,4,348,4.323076923076923
