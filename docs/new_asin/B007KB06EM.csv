8519040,5,B007KB06EM,Very good true stories of peoples experience of discovering who they are. And once you understand why your a bit queer with some things......you can never pretend again and need to live openly and honestly.  So many times straight people want to 'cure' a homosexual or lesbian or trans gender person.  But I ask you can you 'cure' someone with blue eyes or white skin or some genetic thing were born with?  Add being queer or what ever you want to call loving someone the same gender as yourself.  It just cant be done.  But like changing eye color you could use coloured contact lenses and just the same with your sexuality you can mask it and pretend your something else but it is never the real you.  Who you are born to be.  There cab be so much fuss about two people that love one another and just happen to be the same gender.  The most rediculous comparisons are made about accepting these people.  Well as a 'queer' person myself I know how ridiculous that can be and how hard the road to accepting oneself can be when you find you are different.  But once you discover difference is delightful life can be dynamic!  Good movies but many won't understand why and be very challenged but a few will enjoy.

8519042,5,B007KB06EM,"These films all touch on very real family relationships, specifically with families learning how to approach homosexuality (with Change of Heart and The Truth About Jane, which is still a challenge for many.  I find these films to be very moving, complex, and I find that they stand the test of time.  I'm really glad it was such a good deal, as well.",1334534400,2,351,4.555555555555555
8519043,5,B007KB06EM,Rarely do films touch on issues like these.  These are all VERY insightful films that can bring up powerful conversations.  I've watched these films with my family as well as used them in my contemporary issues class (I'm a high-school teacher).  I think these are all must-see films.  It's a great collection for a great price.,1333584000,2,328,4.803571428571429
