4193067,2,B003U0AHBO,"The title reference is for the climactic scene, a reverse seaborne invasion in which director Ridley Scott apparently bought all the Higgins landing craft from ""Saving Private Ryan"", painted them brown to simulate wood, stuck on some oars and swung them 180 degrees around to attack England!

But this latest edition of the famous myth seems to borrow from several movies, notably the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (Nottingham resembles the Shire in all its pleasant, pastoral heartiness. All Friar Tuck {Mark Addy} needs is a pair of hairy feet), ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" among others. The plot, itself, is pedestrian. Bald-headed bad guy (Mark Strong) connives with French to have them invade England. Robin and his merry men (and woman) foil the deed but then are outlawed for taking all the credit from their envious king.

The actual history is all shot to hell, not that the average viewer will care. There are some disturbing ""Taxes equals Tyranny"" references that should fire up the Tea Party crowd but King John (Oscar Isaac) is portrayed more as a buffoon than a tyrant. Sure, he tears up the Magna Carta but we know that eventually, he will sign it at Runnymede in 1215, an act that will safeguard the rights of the nobility and ignore the common people completely (a fact the Tea Partiers would do well to remember).

But there are some high notes and the viewer is gratified to find some chemistry between ""Lady"" (not ""Maid"") Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robin Hood (perfectly cast by Russell Crowe). The opening siege of the French castle is a lot more exciting than the confusing beach battle scene at the end and the rollicking dance sequences look genuinely merry. Max von Sydow and a surprisingly cast William Hurt anchor the drama as well.

Overall, however, this new edition reminded me of a big dinner at a fast food restaurant. An hour after it's over, you don't really remember it. The real Robin Hood deserved better.",1273795200,8,1942,4.840361445783133

4193078,1,B003U0AHBO,"Robin Hood, 2010 film

In times of tyranny and injustice when the law oppresses the people the outlaw takes his place in history, such as England at the turn of the 12th century. In Nottingham three are hoof beats in the night. Someone has stolen their seed grain. King Richard the Lion Heart is plundering his way back to England after ten years on his Crusade. Robin Longstride, an archer, is outlawed for defending the weak against the strong. Men approach a castle to attack it with arrows while others attempt to scale the walls. In London King John enjoys the company of a French noblewoman. There is a question of succession, his wife is barren. Elsewhere gambling leads to a fight, and punishment. Philip of France plots against Richard the Lion Heart. Back at the castle the King is struck by an arrow!

There is an ambush in the forest! Back in Nottingham the people need seed grain for planting. The survivors sail to England. Locksley delivers the crown to the Kings mother, who gives it to John. High taxes oppress the people, these are difficult times. A new Marshal is chosen. Robin Longstride seeks Sir Locksley, who offers him a deal to pose as his son to save his lands. A pigeon brings news that 200 French soldiers have landed. Robin and Marian ride their lands (without hats). Robin converses with Friar Tuck. The Tax Collectors come to villages and use force. Marshal tells the Queen Mother about Godfrey, who is in contact with the King of France. Isabella tells John, who reacts. The Sheriff of Nottingham is an ally of Godfrey. King John meets Marshal for advice. Godfrey plans to attack Nottingham.

Robin is told of his fathers fate. The Barons gather, Marshal speaks. King John arrives to warn about the French. Robin speaks next about building from the ground up, a Charter of Liberty by law. King John promises to do that. French soldiers invade Nottingham, killing, looting, and burning. Godfrey meets Marian, it is not friendly. The English ride there to attack the invaders and stop them. French ships arrive and get the signal to land. The English go to war. Their arrows fall like hail on the invaders. There is a cavalry charge and battle scenes. Then a duel between Robin and Godfrey. The French withdraw to fight another day. King John burns the Charter and declares Robin an outlaw! These outlaws have no taxes or tithes, or rich or poor. The legends begin.

This is not a good story. Too many dark scenes, and too different from the past legends and movies, such as the 1938 movie. It deserves to be avoided. But I don't know much about 12th century English history. Was the story accurate?",1523836800,,2630,4.673866090712743

4193134,1,B003U0AHBO,"This movie begins by maligning King Richard and the Crusades.  Nevermind that the reason for the Crusades was to end 700 bloody, brutal years of Muslim occupation of Spain and Southern France, thousands of people kidnapped by Muslims for slaves during attacks against England and Northern Europe, and countless others murdered, ISIS style, for disbelieving in Islam, King Richard is made out to be the bad guy for participation in the Crusades, and Muslims are made out to be innocent victims of the Crusades.  Historically, nothing could be further from the truth.  This movie is another entry in a long line of revisionist propaganda produced by Progressive Hollywood with a political agenda to sell you.  Notice the complete lack of high budget Hollywood films depicting the violent conquests of Europe by Muslims.  That topic would be taboo.

If you're a progressive multiculturalist who has never read the Koran or read the history of Islamic conquests, you may like this didactic piece of rubbish. I prefer a bit of realism in my historical fictions; or at least the absense of political preachiness.",1499040000,10,1106,5.082872928176796
4193135,3,B003U0AHBO,"This movie is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I skipped over it when released because of what appeared to be a major miscasting of the parts. Russell Crow -a fantastic actor- simply is not Robin Hood. Wrong body type, wrong acting background, just wrong for the part. The Robin Hood we've come to know since Douglas Fairbanks portrayed him in 1922 is not the angry looking grimacing warrior as portrayed in the image on the jacket.

That's the way I felt anyway, but lately I've been on a Robin Hood binge, and it seemed this film should be examined regardless. After viewing it, although my feelings about the miscasting stand, and now extend to the Marion part (it's traditionally been spelled in the feminine form as 'Marian' by the way), and to the King Richard part as well, this production has redeeming values. The middle of the film is really quite riveting... something fine is being woven together. There is this slow, gentle thawing between Robin and Marion, the plot is taking some interesting twists and turns... hope is sparked. But then the movie kind of goes downhill. Why?

- The challenge with Crow in the part is that you don't want to end up with the actor simply doing a modified version of his role in Gladiator. That was an iconic role, and the character Maximus is given some iconic moments. Like being passed a sword through mid air while on horseback and catching it perfectly. So, no matter what don't have Crow do that in this Robin Hood production because it will look like the story lacks originality. So, of course they do it. Twice! (""Hey Beavis, Russell can catch a weapon in mid air you know!"" ""He he. Yeah. Let's make him do it here too. That'll be cool. He he."" -Beavis and Butt-Head directing a film)

- Marion of course must be updated to fit the modern woman, who is a natural warrior, innately knows karate, and can defeat any man. And that's exactly the trap they fall into. Somehow 125 lb Kate Blanchett can stride up to a soldier wearing body armor, who makes no attempt to attack her or even defend himself, and with one swing of her sword cut through the chain mail and bring the man down. Ok!

- King Richard, played by Danny Huston, is not a believable character because Huston has a very distinctive voice, and is apparently unable to alter it for a role. So instead of getting King Richard you are pulled out of the film whenever Huston opens his mouth.

- One of the reasons the movie falls apart at the end -other than Marion showing up at the head of her orphan army wearing custom fitted armor- is that the third act of the film is mostly two big fight scenes. And the fight scenes are built around quick-cuts, which is basically a cheat that does not in any way portray an actual battle. Once you've been spoiled by a properly staged medieval battle from the likes of a director like Kurosawa, these modern quick-cut based battles come off as amateur night.

- Then to top it all off there is a scene where Robin Hood is parting with Marion for a time, and Crow is given the line ""I love you"". Oh, puleeze. I mean if anything, it was her line to be delivered to him because she had been the reticent holdout. It would have been the sign he had fully won her over. But noooo. Really though, they would have been better off to skip the line entirely and not interfere with the lovely organic love story that had been simmering. We KNOW they love each other at this point!

Other than that the movie was great!!",1498953600,,3474,4.427230046948357

4193143,2,B003U0AHBO,"This movie, as a whole, was pretty decent. Russell Crowe is a superb actor, and this type of movie suited him well. His merry companions were all well casted and I found them all to be humorous, and the actors filled their rolls well. Why then did I give it 2 stars you ask?

Kate Blanchet........

First off, Kate always has to play the ""warrior princess"" in all her movies, which I could care less, however, Mariam has always been played by a woman of great morale fortitude and strong will, but never as supreme leader blanchet ruler and overlord, suffering at the idiotic whims of the lesser males that only rule due to ""patriarchy"". This wasn't overwhelming though, so I managed to make all the way into the very end. However, the ending, was just to damn absurd. The armor worn by ""knights"" back then was horrendously heavy, and crafted to fit. Take away the ridiculous scene where she rides into battle in full plate mail. The swords were also known, including the one she wields like a feather duster, to be up to 30 lbs and greater. Its one thing to have a spoofy action flick, and its something else to have a fictional reality where every thing is quasi realistic  to the time until warrior princess Kate Blanchet rides in to save the day with the ""wild boys"" that stole all the food, and put the manor in such a compromising position to begin with. Awful, the ending was so bad, I stopped it without  watching the the last minutes of the movie and just basically wrote the whole thing off.

If they wanted to incorporate a woman into the battle scene they could have just casted a lead female with physical viability.",1492560000,,1629,4.489864864864865

4193150,5,B003U0AHBO,"A very interesting twist on the beloved story.  This is rich in great performances by a really fine cast.  I didn't want it to end.

Russell Crowe is terrific in this film, and so are many of the supporting actors.  Cate Blanchett is a great fit for this tough as nails, yet vulnerable and lonely Marion, who works to the bone along with the staff to keep this farm estate running.

I liked that their romance was organic and not overdone in any way.  Afterall, they have a lot of fish to fry in this epic version of the quest for liberty and justice.

If like me, and you wanted to see another installment, there's an additional alternative on APrime called the Adventures of Robin Hood that I stumbled upon.  It's a 1950s era British TV series that has 20+ episodes and it looks very promising.

4193156,1,B003U0AHBO,"The script for this version of Robin Hood is rather poor. Rather than seeing Robin Hood as a merry man leading his troop of Merry Men through Sherwood Forest, we see Longstreet (the birth family of Robin Hood) masquerading as Sir. Loxley of Nottingham, hanging out around Norttingham Town.  Longstreet (as he is referred to throughout the movie when he is not being addressed as Sir. Loxley) returns a dying Sir. Loxley's sword to Sir. Loxley's father. It turns out that Sir. Loxley is Maid Marian's husband. Question: Why would Maid Marian ever marry such as man we meet as the dying Sir. Loxley? He is a total dweeb. And so the pretense begins. Not once do we see Robin Hood rob from the rich and give to the poor. In fact we don't meet his Merry Men at all.
Another thing that sours this movie is Scott's direction of Crow. He is directed to have a dour face throughout the movie; in fact he doesn't smile once thoughout the movie. Scott gives no chance to unwind his considerable acting talents.
I cannot recommend that anyone waste their precious time on this version of Robin Hood.",1486425600,2,1087,4.545918367346939

4193161,5,B003U0AHBO,"Can a Roman Gladiator become an English archer?  Yes!
Can the well-known, oft-told Robin Hood story be massively reimagined and still be true to the tale?  Surprisingly, yes it can.

There is a lot of wit in this versionplus fine acting, canny directing, and a very fresh and imaginative screenplay.
**May contain spoilers**
Russell Crowe is an archer in King Richard's army, returning from a Crusade.  Suddenly the King is dead and Fate offers Crowe and friends a windfall.  They find a get-out-of-France-free card and return to England.  Small catch:  they must deliver the news of Richard's death to London, where people may know that Crowe is not who he pretends to be.  And Crowe, as Robin Longstride, promises to deliver news of the death of Robin of Locksley to Locksley's father, together with the family sword.

Then there's the devious development where the elder Locksley, Max von Sydow, asks Crowe to pretend to be his son.  The son has been away on the Crusade so long that no one can tell the difference.  And that makes Crowe suddenly the husband of Cate Blanchett, who's having none of this.  But she cannot inherit the property when the elder Locksley dies.  Only a man can inherit under the laws of the day.  Its an itchy, tempestuous courtship with no guarantees.

All that and some other good bits--assassination plots, impending French invasion by sea, the wily beekeeper known as Friar Tuck, and that moldy old Sheriff--would make a nice variation of the Robin Hood story.  But screenwriter Brian Helgeland and director Ridley Scott add a bit of genius.  They connect some past history to a developing story that leads to the Magna Carta, with Robin of Locksley a primal element in the English winds of political change.  It's a Forrest Gump twist.

I grew up with Errol Flynn's Robin Hood as a favorite movie.  I enjoyed Kevin Costner as an aw-shucks American Robin Hood in the 1991 version, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.  (The witchcraft angle was an odd note, but then Morgan Freeman added some sparkle.  The arrow camera effects were very cool.)

Given that, I was skeptical of this new version.  Ultimately, Helgeland and Scott changed the classic story a lot, and they didn't change anything.  Crazy, but true.  It works.

This 3-disc version has good behind-the-scenes commentary that illuminates director Scott's goals for Robin Hood.  Nice bonus.

I hope you find this 2010 version of Robin Hood to be as much fun as I did.  And, that you find this review helpful in some way.

Overall I enjoy watching it again and again when I want to sit back and relax.

4193254,5,B003U0AHBO,"Historically the movie was only somewhat accurate; more so as far as being aligned with period settings and wardrobe of the day. In truth, during the battle at the castle Limoges, King Richard I was actually hit in the shoulder (not the neck), with a bolt from a crossbow. He died rather slowly from infection over a period of 12 days. Also, King Richard I died long before the legendary figure Robin Hood was potentially even born. There is no real historical record of the legendary Robin Hood existing, only hints within written works. There is the potential based on recorded writings that Robin Hood was employed by King Edward II during 1323, long after King Richard I. However, there is no actual documentation to support this as being factual. So yes, there was some fabrication indeed added to the story for add excitement. However, it was far more believable than the Kevin Costner version, as exciting as it was. Its a fun fanciful story designed to showcase the hero and his longing love affair with a madden who, in the story, needed no hero herself as she was a very capable woman on her own. She was only missing a man worthy of her love. The subtle development between Russell and Cate's characters were heartwarming. Cate delivers such a regal presence no matter what role she plays. And as for Russell, you would have to be an absolutely horrible director to ever make Russell look bad. Russell, Cate, and Max Von Sydow are all that good as actors.",1472860800,10,1466,4.664092664092664

4193338,3,B003U0AHBO,"Mixing romantic legend with the palpable reality demanded by modern audiences is always a slippery slope. This film seems to succeed by combining understated romance with a grim portrayal of the medieval world at war. It is a refreshing revisiting of the Robin Hood legend, and I highly recommend it. That said, I think it falls a little short of the romance required for an historic legend. It bends British history a bit, and that is certainly no sin when retelling legendary folklore. The debunking of Richard Lionheart as an heroic figure is nothing new. The vilification of King John is almost required in any retelling of the tale. To put the Magna Carta into the mix is perhaps pushing the envelope a bit too far.

Again, the film is a little short on romance. This is probably the script and not the performances. If Russell Crowe seems a bit wooden, it is outweighed by Cate Blanchett's clever performance as she reluctantly falls in love. I confess that I am not an impartial critic. Since I saw ""Robin and Marian"" in 1976 it has become my gold standard for Robin Hood films. Sean Connery, Audrey Hepburn, Nicol Williamson and Robert Shaw revisit the legend as players past their prime. Five stars for that film. Three stars for this one.",1457308800,,1248,4.698630136986301

4193355,3,B003U0AHBO,"I admit that I wasn't going to offer a review, since it seemed to me the most recent were back in 2011? Managed to correct that off beat, and went forward, just sharing thoughts of the film.
Same old story.
Exactly my point.

Robin Hood. Robin O'th' hood.  Robin of Lochsley.  Robin of Locksley.  Red Robbin.

But for the last listed, (which is a semi-fast'ish restaurant, BTW), those names all have one thing in common. They represent personas made fun and popular by old myths, fairy tales, and fiction.  Most assuredly, fiction.

Folks, please understand. I enjoy the stories. Some of the actors I enjoy not only in their particular vehicle, but in others where you recognize them from another film project.  It's amusing to make a trivia out of the old childhood tales. But where is there any evidence in documentation that this ""returning soldier"" was anything like the films and books we've seen or read.  He doesn't even have a ""Last four"".  No one wants to be without a ""Last Four"".

So we all suspend belief for a bit, put down the chores list and turn your phone off.  Don't slyly try to check your im, twitter feed, you-tube account or instagram.  No fair cheating.  The point is to relax and let yourself escape.  Puff up a bit during the horse chases and battles, then slide back down and lay low for the fireside chats all the characters seem to have, regularly.  Agreeing that this is a make believe hero of the people, now I would like to share what I took away from the film.

Russell Crowe looks so hot on a horse. Even just standing at ease.
I liked the truthful representation of the costumes. Simple people didn't bathe. cripes, even royalty, for the most part, shunned bathing. Here, everyone sort of looked more authentic than not. So good job, wardrobe. Also stage set. Nicely done.

I appreciated the little nod to history, by mentioning what would become the Magna Carta, King John did indeed sign it at the insistence of his barons they would not support him in war unless he did.  Historically, a really important document.  The end of serfdom.

I thought stunts were very well accommodated, mostly big fight scenes I suspect may have been graphically assisted. No worries, it looked real enough.

By choosing a differing story line, one thin step from A to B, was ballsy. Congrats to Crowe & Scott for some guts. Give folks just this tad off from what they expect, and you'll have their interest.  At the very pointline, they tried. It worked.  And a new formula is born.

Thought Blanchette was especially helpful by allowing herself to be a bit dirty. Gave her role some muscle.  Usually, Robin Hood tales do not include a Mrs. Hood, only a maid Marion. Now they're giving up Lady Marion? Whoa.  Someone let the cat out of the bag on that one, IMO. Since Blanchette was really giving a great effort, this I will gladly add about her. The woman is drop dead gorgeous, with or without a drop of makeup.  Adjusting for when this film was released, we may add on some years, but still....she looked fabulous, even covered in dirt.

I think the supporting roles were very nicely filled, I saw another Brit actor, as Friar Tuck.  I am sorry I cannot remember his name, but his face is so recognizable I new of him for Hugh Grant's, ""Love Actually"", as the staunch and stout best friend, Billy... to the burnt out aging rocker, played by Bill Nighy, also from ""Love Actually"",  I thought there were a few of Gibson's  ""Braveheart"", particularly among the better dressed  ""nobles"".  I think it's nice to acknowledge those performers whose names may not be headliners.  So, Ergo.

Only one serious complaint.  I'm watching the film on a little chromebook, which is quite useful.  But speaker quality.... blue tooth and I don't play well together.  So, speakers. With this version, this adaptation, the soundtrack is absolutely, no doubt, hands down the most annoying and aggravating I have ever heard.  No real vocals, just these strident plucked strings, some percussion, flute. I supposed it was meant to stir the imagination. For me, it got on my nerves to the point where I finally used the captions, and turned the sound off.  Think a paper cut from an envelope on your tongue...whee howdy! Yes, that sort of strident, stinging, razor-like pain my ears picked up.  The tempo, the noise, just awful. So I feel it fair to say it must be on notice that I have put in my 2 cents.

I recommend the film, with all it's pluses and minuses, but I think I have to vote for Costner's production as the better of just these two.  My reason why is because with this film, it's all Longshots, landscape, views of the White Cliffs of Dover, the ocean; all great.
But Costner's gives us the soft, well-worn comfort of the story tale we all remember, about a marvelous hero of the people, a man called, ""ROBIN HOOD"".",1453161600,,4827,4.608440797186401
4193356,5,B003U0AHBO,I like romantic ends,1452988800,,20,4.25
4193357,1,B003U0AHBO,"I wanted to like this movie, because Russell Crowe is an amazing actor and remarkable man in his own right, but after serious evaluation with a close friend I found this film to be absolutely dreadful in many numerous ways.

 Being a fan of 1991's ""Robin Hood"" with Kevin Costner, which itself was a serious shift in the tradition of the story adding in modern politics with present day slang language themes, I was hoping Crowe's version would top Costner's just as Christopher Nolen and Christian Bale's Batman topped Michael Keaton's.

 What I can state is this Robin Hood is terrible beyond words, we have a massive historically inaccurate and nasty portrayal of King Richard the Lionheart's character which is central to Robin Hood's merry old England.

 This is an action adventure story based on the events of the real Great Britain, France, Scotland, and the Middle East in terms of the time of the holy crusaders and their warfare and travels.  Any depiction of Robin Hood that shows a false, distorted version of these nation's history and themes is fabrication and pornographication of the highest order. King Richard was NOT murdered in France on his way home to England after his last crusade fighting the Muslim Warriors in the holy land.  While away on his campaign, treacherous political insiders had taken control of England and ran the nation into the ground with their acts of corruption.  King Richard, who was Norman and probably did not even speak the English language, nevertheless returned home to restore England's laws and economy.

Other characters this film got wrong include the Sheriff, who is reduced to a bumbling fool and a minor character on the side. Maid Marion perhaps is portrayed the worst, first she is absolutely not attractive in anyway, then because of political correctness where women just have to act just as aggressively as men do, she puts on armor and becomes a battle field warrior.  The actress herself was fine, it's just this awful material that was given to her.

 The king's villainous character was also problematic for me, he just was a bore and not a worthy opponent for larger then life heroic figure in the form of Russell Crowe.

 Now on to Robin Hood himself, we find out through the film that this character is not the famous Sir Robin of Locksley, but instead just this random archery enthusiast soldier from the woods who just happens to find the real person's dead body and takes his identity.  Huh??? What??  If that is the road the filmmakers wanted to go down, which is a huge turn into crazy avenue, then why not just make Robin's origin that of a traveling space alien instead?  At least that would have had equal stature, or made a little bit more sense then that central plot theme.

 To top that off we get a monumental D-Day style beach assault on the shores of Britain that rivaled anything conceived by the Allies themselves back in WW2.  Absolutely abysmal, why not have a medieval version of an F-22 Raptor jet fighter too while we are at it??? That would have made just as much sense.

So over all I had to give this movie a huge well deserved F+, and a big thumbs down.  If a kid or teenager wants to watch this film, with an attempt to be entertained and also learn important lessons on British history, then forget this turkey.  Here they are with the amazing Russell Crowe and still they create this monstrosity of a film.",1452988800,,3406,4.6952861952861955
4193358,5,B003U0AHBO,"The 2010 Ridley Scott production of the legend of Robin Hood has an exciting story delivered by some of the best actors in a beautiful 12th century setting with authentic weapons and costumes from the time of the First Crusade.  What more could be want?

This is an original telling of the tale of the origin of Robin Hood, not the oft-repeated story line used by so many previous dramatic presentations of the subject.  Folklore about this character gives us dozens and perhaps hundreds of versions of the story, so in the absence of an 800-year-old eye witness, who can say what the historically ""authentic"" version might be?

The film does have the obligatory ""strong woman"" moments where Cate Blanchett, as Marion, shows her expertise with a bow and arrives at the climactic battle in full armor (after all, it's an early 21st Hollywood release) but to the tremendous credit of Ridley Scott, despite her courage she does not fare well in her encounter in battle against a veteran army commander who out-weighs her by at least 50 pounds of male muscle and 100 hours of hands-on combat experience.  There are no unrealistic ""oh come on..."" moments to throw you out of the story, except perhaps for Russell Crowe's Hail Mary longshot where he takes out the bad guy with an arrow.  We never would have forgiven Ridley Scott if he'd missed that shot, so we can still applaud that bit even when the odds were astronomically against Robin's arrow finding its mark.

The Blu-ray version is as good as expected with excellent resolution and audio, but it has an odd feature where the screen goes to the Universal logo if you the film paused for too long and can get locked up so that the only recourse is to completely restart the film.  This is the only Blu-ray where I've seen that feature so we can hope that Universal realized that it was a colossally bad idea and stopped doing it.",1452816000,,1881,4.644578313253012

I like this variation because of its attempt at being potentially more historically accurate, as to who Robin actually may have been.  Russell Crowe is a good actor.  The portrayal is real, human, nonfantastic, typical for Ruissell. his ""mark"" if you will.  Again, the story is very different, but still hits on the key points of the typical story.

4193431,4,B003U0AHBO,"During the Age of Enlightenment (approximately 1670 to 1800), the medieval world and its literature was dismissed if not vilified. The popularity of chivalric romances had by the late 17th century begun to wain in northern-western European countries, particularly England/Britain and France. The chivalric romance as a viable literary genre began with the Arthurian legends in the late Middle Ages, climaxed with Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene and similar fair in the late 16th century and sort of ended anti-climatically with Cervantes' satirical Don Quixote. Classical Literature became the rage while the medieval world was sometimes labeled as the ""Barbarous Age"". The Enlightenment dismissed most of medieval culture, including their literature. And then, in the 19th century, interest in what we think of as the Middle Ages suddenly was reborn. Readers, writers, poets, artists and composers alike rediscovered The Arthurian and Chivalric Romances, as exemplified by Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"", the Arthurian paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and the operas of Richard Wagner. ""Robin Hood"", directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe and Kate Blanchett, is essentially born out of the tradition of the medieval chivalric romance and stems from our fascination with the Middle Ages since the 19th century which has continued unabated up to the present time.

While some viewers may feel somewhat cheated in the story department as it chronicles the origins of Robin Hood rather than centering on the tales that made him a legend, there is a lot going for the present film. As an amateur medieval scholar, I have seen few films that recreate the medieval world as honestly and accurately as this one, others that come to mind are ""The Name of the Rose"", ""The Lion in Winter"" (which chronicles events just prior to that of ""Robin Hood""), ""Braveheart"" and (ironically) ""Robin and Marion"" (starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn in the famous roles). ""Robin Hood"" is set inside the historical context of the late 12th and early 13th centuries.

The real-life Robin Hood is somewhat of a mystery and an enigma whose exploits may be the result of later exaggeration and embellishment. Scholars have revealed two figures who may be the origin of the legendary outlaw: Robert of Loxley and Robin Longstride. The present film incorporates aspects of both figures into a single character, played by Russell Crowe, and it works more or less. The story opens with the military campaign between France and England who have been fighting one another since before the age of the dinosaurs. At the helm is Richard the Lionheart, back from the Crusades and fighting to take Normandy from his adversary King Philip of France. Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is in military service on the English side who are sieging a French castle. Richard the Lionheart falls in battle, failing to return to English soil. Robert of Loxley is then slain at the hands of a French ambush, and Robin Longstride comes upon the dying knight. Loxley entreats Longstride to return his sword to his father, Walter of Loxley.

Ruling in the king's stead back in London is Richard's brother, John, who becomes the new English monarch and begins his unjust and merciless reign which has become so much entrenched in the legends of Robin Hood. Part of the story relates the real-life threat of civil war between King John and the noble barons who did force the king to sign one of the most famous of documents, the Magna Carta (""Great Charter"") in 1215. The Magna Carta ensured that the barons had certain rights and could not be deprived of their lands and liberty without proper trial. According to the film, King Philip of France has devised a plan to cross the English Channel and conquer England for France in the hopes that the English nobility is splintered. Meanwhile, Longstride honors his vow to return the sword to the family in Loxley where he meets, of course, Marion of Loxley, a.k.a. Maid Marion (Kate Blanchett).

The screenwriters are not going to be taking home any statuettes (at least not for this film), but the screenplay is decent, and better than expected with a bit of humor thrown in here and there, although I wish there had been a little more. There is something strangely humorous about the Middle Ages. In the acting department, Crowe holds his own as does Blanchette, although these are not stellar performances. Blanchette's later portrayal in the final battle sequence is decidedly un-medieval, making it appear like she's some kind of medieval feminist. My main criticism is that Little John and Friar Tuk enjoy very little character development, but hopefully this will be corrected in subsequent installments.

The real star of the show is the battle scenes, which are probably the most accurate recreations of medieval military conflict on film and some of the most compelling since Excalibur and The Lord of the Rings. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Overall an enjoyable and better-than-expected film, and certainly a must if you enjoy the medieval world. But don't expect Robin Hood to steal from the rich--yet.",1433462400,,5160,5.065882352941176

4193442,2,B003U0AHBO,"This movie was a little too ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart,"" and not enough Errol Flynn's ""Robin Hood."" It seemed  like director Ridley Scott was just looking for an excuse to remake those movies, instead of accurately capturing the spritely and adventuresome spirit of Robin Hood, which was the only reason to make this movie to begin with. This movie entirely missed the point. It was an ok, decent action movie as it stands alone, but sort of dampened the almost magical story of the original. At the end of the day, this movie didn't need to be made. Also, audiences didn't really need to pay to see it.

They were really banking on the excitement of huge scale battles and gritty, realistic action, but that is more befitting of a TV movie on TBS or ""Gladiator,"" and totally missed the essence of ""Robin Hood."" The only recognizable thing of the Robin Hood legend was the fight between Robin and the oppressive king. When I saw that storyline, I thought, ""Now we're getting somewhere,"" but that was the only element that resembled the legend of Robin Hood, and thus, this movie only vaguely resembles what everyone loves about the original story.

Carey Elwes made a farcical version of ""Robin Hood"" with Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights,"" but it is too bad that they didn't tap him for a serious version of Robin Hood that relived the Flynn school. After playing Wesley/The Man in Black in ""The Princess Bride,"" he nailed the spirit of Robin Hood to a T. I sort of wished they decided to go in that direction for this movie, but Hollywood is quite hit or miss in getting what one wants. It's too bad that Elwes's portrayal of Robin Hood was squandered on a spoof. Robin Hood is supposed to have a spirit of adventure, with dash and lan, not just be a gritty action movie.

In any event, Russell Crowe (once again) is not quite right for this role, and he banks a little too much on being understated. Is he ever going to try anything else? He just keeps applying that formula to every role he does, and the only place where it was a dead on was in ""L.A. Confidential."" Otherwise, we have a decent, or mediocre action movie. If you are a huge fan of action movies, maybe you'll even give this 4 or 5 stars. As I'm a fan of cinema, film history. and recapturing the essence of what makes classics so awesome, I have to look at this and think that it pales in comparison to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood. I've got no real problem giving this two stars.",1431648000,,2454,4.470982142857143

I love the story of Robin Hood, in fact who doesnt? A man who helps those less fortunate over those who are tyrants, everyone likes that, well unless you are a tyrant. This is a newer version of the legend though as told by director Ridley Scott. I know that some have not liked that but over all I thought this was a good film. The acting was great and the film looked great as well.

The film follows a group of soldiers in the Kings army after they go AWOL since they were being punished. They happen upon a massacre that sees some of their own dead that were taking the dead Kings crown home. They decide that this would be a perfect opportunity to gain some wealth and carrying out these guys mission, acting as them. So after doing so the new King does not reward them so they are off on another mission. Robin made a promise to one of the fallen knights they came across to go to his father and family in Nottingham. After doing so a turn of events leads these men on a path that would become legend.

Scott is an excellent filmmaker had has been behind some straight classics. With that said this movie falls short of some of his other works. The movie is a good one but for me it takes itself a little too seriously. When I watch a Robin Hood flick I am going in looking to have fun. Now of course that is my own fault because I didn't research the film beforehand. If I had I would have known that Scott was trying to be a little more serious with this interpretation.  So knowing that now I would say that he made a good film over all.

The acting is good as one would expect with Crowe and crew but to be honest I saw this for Mark Addy. He is one of my favorite actors and I still wish his sitcom Still Standing would be released on DVD [please who ever owns that]. Also Cate Blanchett is excellent here and one of the best things about the movie. The sets and look of the film is wonderful of course and the film moves along nicely in both the theatrical and the Directors cut. If you haven't seen this then I say check it out but expect a more serious telling of the legend with some things changed around of course.",1431216000,,2143,4.129496402877698

4193474,4,B003U0AHBO,"Too bad Ridley Scott had to cut a few scenes for theatrical release.  The director's cut adds some dimension, especially to Lady Marian that helped the movie and actually helped the contrived ending make more sense.  There are some great bits of ""back story"" here for anyone passingly familiar with the traditional Robin Hood myth.  Russell Crowe is spot on in this adventure yarn (he's always good when directed by Scott, Ron Howard or Peter Weir, but not so much when anyone else is directing).  Cate Blanchett is sexy and smart as always, and Max von Sydow is superb.  In some ways, though, the movie belongs to the villains--Mark Strong as the evil and traitorous Godfrey and Oscar Isaac as King John steal every scene they're in.

The only weak points are William Hurt, who seems badly out of his element in a costume drama set in Olde England...and the ridiculously impossible elements (no spoiler here) of the climactic battle.",1427414400,2,934,4.80625

4193493,5,B003U0AHBO,"I have been a Robin Hood fan all my life, and, like most Americans 40 years of age and over, I have come to judge any cinematic treatment of the legend by Errol Flynn's 1938 film, which is the Hollywood ""gold standard"" of Robin Hood motion pictures.  I still love Flynn's film.
  However, as a student and an instructor of medieval history, I must point out that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe crafted a much grittier, more realistic picture of 12th century England than was possible in Errol Flynn's heyday.  Make no mistake--I absolutely HATED this film when I went to see it in the theater for the first time because it was chopped into disjointed segments that made it very hard for the average viewer to understand what was going on.
  That being said, PLEASE buy the unrated Director's Cut, because I am fairly certain that you will fall in love with this version of Robin Hood's legend all over again, as I have.  There are no gaps in the Director's Cut, and the Theatrical Version is also available for comparison.  The DVD transfer is clear and sharp, and the audio (as well as the  subtitles where necessary,) are wonderful.
  The most striking thing about this film is that Robin Hood is portrayed as an average man with extraordinary integrity.  Russell Crowe's Robin is probably much closer to what the actual Robin Hood must have been like.  Cate Blanchett is no Olivia De Havilland, but her characterization of Marian is as strong as Crowe's Robin, and together they make a superior film.  Max Von Sydow (The Greatest Story Ever Told, 1965) and William Hurt (Altered States, 1981) almost steal the show in their own right as Walter Loxley and William Marshal.
  This film is steeped in enough historical accuracy to at once spark a ""newbie's"" curiosity and an ""old pro's"" quest for more knowledge of the subject, which is what all good historical biopics aspire to do.  Buy it and enjoy!",1425945600,,1902,4.680722891566265

4193509,1,B003U0AHBO,"Left me wondering if Ridley Scott is just senile in his old age for having directed the script to this movie.

Here it seems Scott (the director) is trying to capitalize on star power to get this medieval action drama going. Crowe does an okay job as Robin and everything else seems like it's just another remake of a classic story. There is so many ways one can make this story of Robin Hood and there sure will several more by the end of this millennium. This one just missed the mark.

The story had no initial magic to get me to think ""Wow this is a realistic and unique take on Robin Hood."" No. It just left me feeling they should have waited for a better script that can truly capture the heroic je ne sais quoi that Errol Flynn portrayed in the 1930s version of this mythical guy.

One good thing I can say for this movie... Crowe is hella lot better than Costner!",1424044800,,871,4.234939759036145

4193583,5,B003U0AHBO,I had gotten this on a whim cause Dennis became temporally obsessed with a thing Robin Hood.  This was actually a better movie than I suspected.

4193603,5,B003U0AHBO,Liked him in Master and Commander; loved him in Robin Hood. Russell Crowe is turning out to be one of my favorite actors. This story for me is the best one about the origin of the character of Robin Hood in an era of the divine right of a king. Couple that with a powerful portrayal by another actor of the character of Maid Marion (Cate Blanchett) and you have a wonderful and dramatic story of a man trying to overcome tyranny and oppression. This is a DVD that you won't be ashamed to show people how freedom was won.,1410739200,,520,4.21

4193614,3,B003U0AHBO,"With the normally reliable Ridley Scott directing and Russell Crowe effortlessly spraying his rough-trade charisma over every shot he's in, IMO this is considerably better entertainment than the Kevin Kostner version of Robin Hood... in the main because this movie favors gritty, quasi-historical authenticity over tra-la-la Sherwood forest romanticism.  It's about Robin Hood before he became an outlaw and went to hide in the forest with his merry men. If the movie had had somebody other than Cate Blanchett in the role of Maid Marion, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  Not that she does a particularly bad job in the role.  Since the first time I saw her, she's been somebody I suspect I'd dislike even if I met her in real life. YMMV.",1409702400,,746,4.858267716535433

It is obviously a Ridley Scott movie and he knows how to film Russell, but I felt shades of Gladiator in this.  But, good movie, worthy entertainment.",1408492800,,437,4.7105263157894735

Every time the camera focuses on her in any movie, I expect her to come out with a loud goose honk(put her in an obnoxious/homely girl part like her role in The Talented Mr. Ripley and she's perfect).  My wife and I suffered through as much of this mess as possible and finally we both woke up with the credits rolling at the end...both of us griping about the waste of time that Robin Hood is.

4193645,2,B003U0AHBO,"I wanted to like this movie. It has Russell Crowe, and Oscar Isaac as a wonderfully slimy King John, and knights and castles and Robin Hood. But as much as Ridley Scott has a talent for creating gritty and realistic medieval epics (see ""Kingdom of Heaven"") his political and religious proclivities undermine his effort (see ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which was accurately described as ""Osama bin Laden's version of the Crusades""). Mr. Scott, in short, is a loony lefty whose atheism and socialism informs way too many of his movies. Aristocracy and religion- Catholicism, specifically- are his particular btes noires.  In this film, Robin Hood is transformed into a sort of democratic activist; Maid Marian is a sword-wielding warrior princess; the Crusades are condemned as genocidal conquests; King Richard, far from being the familiar archetype of chivalry, is a vain, unjust tyrant; the Church is portrayed as utterly corrupt. If the politically correct Scott could have plausibly shoehorned in a few noble Moslems or Africans, I'm sure he would have. Apart from the leftist agitprop, the movie suffers from a weak plot, made incoherent by all its political revisionism. Worst of all though is that the talents of the great Mark Strong are wasted here, with a poor script and an odd role as a French turncoat.",1405900800,3,1306,5.046296296296297
4193646,4,B003U0AHBO,This was an enjoyable version of the Robin Hood character I'm used to.  I didn't care for Cate Blanchett getting into the last battle scene.  It was a phony addition to an otherwise good movie.,1405814400,2,193,4.485714285714286

4193661,3,B003U0AHBO,"Honestly, there are so many to choose from, but Robin Hood will always be my favorite.  But because of that, I have my own preferred iterations of the history and context for his story.  There were a few variations here that were better than others. Overall, I really enjoyed the comic-relief casting of his ""merry men"" and of course Cate Blanchet was a good actress, but I thought they took an already fairly ""helpless maiden"" character in Marian and made here even more helpless.  They tried not to. She stood up to the sheriff when he tried to bully her into marrying him; she fired a flaming arrow at some marauders in her barn.... and then showed up at battle dressed like a man! Only to completely epicly fail at actual fighting and have to be saved by Robin, when he really could have spent his time better elsewhere in the final battle. Whatever. My feminist red flags were displeased, especially because there was so much potential once they casted Cate in that part.... Lost opportunities.  Russell Crowe did fine. I liked him better in this than Gladiator, which people usually cite as their favorite of his roles.  Personally, my favorite Crowe role was as a fat every-man in The Insider.  But if he insists on doing action, this was less obnoxiously over-the-top than Gladiator.  His Robin Hood was pretty humble and down-to-earth, which I actually did like.  (In contrast to Costner's spoiled rich boy, although for overall story and casting of everything except Robin Hood himself, the Costner version is my favorite.)",1404086400,,1533,4.802281368821292

4193678,4,B003U0AHBO,"I read the reviews on this movie and they were no favourable.  About the only thing I found out of sinc was in the French invasion scene, Second World War landing craft were used.  But these same landing craft actually had oars to propel them.  Aside from that, this was a great movie with authentic clothing, weapons, castles, and atmosphere that prevailed at the dawn of the 12th Century (i.e., 1100s). ""Historian-Purists"" will be critical of this film, but Hollywood does take liberties with historical facts.  I can understand why a lot of viewers do not like the plot, which actually is a ""prequel"" to the classic Robin Hood story.  The plot begins in France as King Richard is hacking and looting his way back home to England.  One of his archers is Robin Longstride who along with other soldiers, is separated from the main army and comes across the dying Robin of Loxley who begs him to return his sword to his father.  Longstride agrees, and to make a long story short, assumes Loxley's identity.  Once at Loxley's home however, he finds oppression is afoot and sets about making alliances with the locals who are not fans of the infamous King John. What follows is a series of magnificent battle scenes, betrayals, murder, and nasty politics.  King John soon finds out that without the support of his Northern English barons who are on the verge of bringing civil war to the land by his punitive taxes, he cannot drive back the invading French army.  King John finally agrees to a ""Magna Carta"" type deal, and when the enemy is routed, reneges on his promise.  Robin of Loxley rebels, the king declares him an outlaw, and ""Robin Hood"" flees to Sherwood Forest.  This is why this plot is a prequel to the classic Robin Hood legend so many expect to see.  However, I did not like the ending and thought that something more is needed.  But in view of the fact that the movie is a long one, (2.5 hours) such an ending would have made it longer than ""Gone With the Wind.""  That Russell Crowe fans will find no fault with this film, I have no doubt.",1400716800,3,2053,4.540760869565218

Back then no husband was akin to a death sentence.  But she plays her as a fiesty, moxy, and boardering on lethal weapon if need be, 'lady'.  They make a fine match.
Oscar Isaac plays a juvenile, snobbish, insensitive 'royal runt' King John.  While Mark Strong plays a perfectly smooth, cold blooded assasin that you want to kill yourself but wouldn't dare.

This movie I find by far the best representation of what life was like back in the early 1200s, at the end of fruitless Crusades that depleted the wealth of countries and killed thousands, leaving England and other countries short of ""fighting"" men.  It is gritty, violent but not gratuitously so, as the times were violent times and warfare was often carried out hand to hand combat.  The chemistry between Cate Blanchard and Crowe is - it just fills the screen.  An excellent script, fast-moving but gives enough feel for historical details so that the viewer who is not familiar with the history of the times in England still ""gets it.""  I did not see a single bad performance.  I high recommend this film.  Oh, it's a love story too, but it is subtle and understated, and is not the main object of the film.

Both versions are a bit long but with a few added scenes, the director's cut gives you just a little bit more to the story that makes it more complete.  I have a casual interest in history but I'm no expert.  I know this movie is not entirely accurate but when you're working with the Robin Hood legend, you obviously have to take some liberties.  I wasn't expecting accuracy.  I only wanted to be entertained and I was.

The film is well cast.  Russell Crowe is excellent as Robin Hood.  He has just the right mix of toughness, intelligence, and charm.  Cate Blanchett is perfect as Marian.  The pair plays off each other well.  The rest of the cast were also good in their roles.

I know a lot of people think the movie was kind of slow.  I suppose it is a bit slow but I feel like the story building is really interesting.  It has the right amount of humor, drama, tragedy, romance, and fighting.

I've been interested in Robin Hood since I was a child.  I've seen most of the movies and read quite a few books.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Errol Flynn will always be the ultimate Robin Hood but Russell Crowe comes very close.",1392163200,,1262,4.339055793991417

Russell Crowe makes a darker, more conniving Hood than standard fare, but he fills the role very well - he's a great lead. Marian, Little John, Tuck, and Alan a'Dale are all very memorable.

The problem is the narrative never really gets going. The plot is shaky and poorly defined - an hour in you're still wondering ""so when does the movie start?""

For the quintessential take on Robin Hood, try Patrick Bergin's 1991 portrayal. It's more ""fun romp"" than ""brooding drama"" - but it's truly Robin Hood start to finish. And it's a nice tight story and full of British wit to boot!",1389052800,,779,4.63768115942029

This version of Robin Hood starring Russell Crowe includes a more synthesized characterization of the legendary hero woven into more historically verifiable events - more or less - to create a similar but perhaps more realistically believable story of Robin Hood.

The story line, costumes, settings and above all, the character portrayals by excellent actors are all sublime.  Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett fit well together and their characters' progression from cordial formality to love is believeable and magnetic.

4193813,4,B003U0AHBO,"Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker as far as look, feel and sound go, but I typically find myself sort of detached from his adventure epics (e.g. ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""1492: Conquest of Paradise""). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them, but the storytelling keeps me at a distance. Since he's not a writer, maybe it's the screenwriter's fault, who knows? Anyway, ""Robin Hood"" (2010) struck me the same way, but not as much.

The film focuses on how Robin of Locksley became Robin the hood. You could say it's a prequel to other film versions of the character. What's strange about this being a prequel is that Robin (Russell Crowe) is clearly in his mid-40s, which means he doesn't even become Robin Hood until his mid-to-late 40s. Cate Blanchett who plays Maid Marion was 40 during filming, not a spring chicken either. I have no problem with an older Robin Hood, but don't expect him to have the acrobatic daring-do of, say, Errol Flynn's depiction (who was only 28 when the classic ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was shot).

In any case, ""Robin Hood"" strikes me as the most realistic version of the character and his medieval setting. Kevin Costner's version from 1991 was realistic too, but Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham gave the film a campy edge (albeit entertaining) and there was some eye-rolling witchcraft dabblings as well (not that some people didn't practice witchcraft back then, but it just came off kind of cartooney). Both of these versions are in contrast to Errol Flynn's approach to the character, who displayed a blatant joie de vivre (""joy of living"") and superhuman heroics. I enjoy all three takes.

The film was shot in England & Wales and runs 141 minutes (theatrical cut) and 156 minutes (director's cut). The DVD has both versions and I viewed the latter.

4193815,2,B003U0AHBO,"As a die-hard Robin Hood fan I have read many books and seen many movies about the life and times of this semi-mythical hero. This movie has to be one of the worst. Although there are some excellent depictions of 12th century accouterments - it appears that many real places were filmed - the basic prequel plot is silly.
  From the death of King Richard (who will have to have one of Miracle Max's miracle pills to return to life and England) to the mish-mash of confusing scenes which are often meaningless, the film misses both farce and serious drama.
  Cate Blanchett makes a marvelously feisty ""maid"" Marion. But alas, she is no maid, married to Robert Loxley until his untimely death before returning to England. She does a valiant job of overcoming the more onerous aspects of a botched script.
  Russel Crowe shows his nearly total lack of facial expression throughout the film, making him look an overly stout, aging man with Bell's palsy. He is totally unbelievable as the leader of an outlaw band.
  Prince/King John can't decide if he is evil, good, or just stupid and petulant. He also looks more like an Arab than an English King.
  One has to wonder why such actors as William Hurt and Max Von Sydow agreed to roles in such a weak production. The only excuse is that actors need money, too. However, both give fine performances in oddly conceived roles. The same cannot be said for the Sheriff of Nottingham and Friar Tuck who both have fairly minor and very confusing roles as neither of them can decide if they are good or bad characters.
  If there is a savior in the film, it's Kevin Durand who makes a wonderfully believable Little John. He adds humor and a light hearted touch to the (too few) scenes in which he plays. The Merry Men aren't too merry, but do add to the action.
  Although admittedly difficult to make a prequel of an ""historical"" myth, the writers obviously had a ball destroying the accepted versions, probably over too many cocktails.
  It's scary to think that the producers of this monstrosity might actually be considering
making a sequel to the prequel. If the legend began here, it's amazing it was passed down through the centuries.

4193816,5,B003U0AHBO,"Every variation of the Robin Hood tale has included changing societal attitudes and values. This is the best version for me because it connects Robin Hood to the Magna Carta, which later inspired the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. What Robin steals from the rich and powerful (even though his attempt is delayed...again), is basic human rights. Yes, the Magna Carta was an agreement between barons and the king...but it provided an opening for yeomen to become a ""middle"" class. There must be a place between those who have everything and those who have nothing. If no such place exists, there will be revolution.

The legend of Robin Hood is important because of the spirit of balance and freedom in human society. Those who rule (by decree or capital) cannot be allowed to take everything and leave everyone else to starve under forced labor. That is an important message for me because the struggle continues today.

This old combat veteran salutes everyone involved in this project for the clarity of vision it represents. Every generation must learn about freedom. This is an amazing tool for doing so in a painless and entertaining manner.",1373932800,,1150,4.922680412371134

It is a different take on the usual Robin Hood story. That was pretty interesting and the re-creation of the middle ages was nicely done.

***SPOILER ALERT***.  At least one eye rolling scene where Cate Blanchett leads a bunch of kids (armed with sharpened sticks) against professional soldiers armed with shields and swords.  I mean come on.  To the movie's credit , it doesn't show these stick fighters kicking a$$ but it doesn't show them getting slaughtered either. I bought the kids living alone and marauding passers-by in Sherwood and even found it kinda interesting but hand to hand combat in open ground with better equipped and better trained soldiers??? Didn't buy that one.

4193853,4,B003U0AHBO,"We first saw this movie in the theater. I thought it was a good historical (before I get crucified here, it's not historically accurate; how about historical-looking?) action flick with Ridley Scott's usual fine eye for visual detail. You felt like you were living in the squalor of the Middle Ages. No Technicolor prettiness here as in earlier versions of the Hood legend. You could almost smell the people's dirty clothes and unwashed bodies.  The actors were well cast but were never overpowered by the visual tapestry of the scenery and costumes. The most striking difference from other versions is that this Marion is more feisty than usually portrayed as just a pretty dressed up damsel in distress. Running an estate for ten years while her husband was off to the Crusades made her a strong woman who could do her share of the farm work and verbally & physically spar with any man who crossed her. We're just not used to seeing an independent Marion so hardened by the weariness of daily toiling etched in her stern face. No time for her to lounge around in glamorous gowns; managing the estate comes first. Cate Blanchett ably matches Russell Crowe as an equal in character and performance. At first it seemed preposterous for her to take part in the final defense against the French coastal invasion, but when you think about it, it fits with her character.

Scott's Hood is a darker version in more ways than one compared to others and its downbeat ending and minimum of humor, unlike the Kevin Costner one, turned off some viewers and critics who also complained about historical inaccuracies and Crowe's accent changing from English to Scottish to Irish which Crowe angrily denied as ""bollocks."" In fairness, Costner was also criticized for his sometimes English accent throughout the course of his film.

Watching the uncut version on Blu-ray last night was better than I expected. The uncut version breathes more detail into characters and plot. It's longer by 15 minutes for a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes but doesn't seem padded with needless exposition like some expanded editions. The video transfer is very good as details are clear in dark scenes. The DTS audio's  surround effects are spectacular especially in reproducing the twangs & thwacks of bows & arrows at play and dialogue is mostly clear. On some films we have to run the subtitles instead of constantly playing with the volume control because you can't hear the actors clearly but this soundtrack wasn't a problem for our old ears. BTW Is it only us who notice this problem in some films?

Viewers who think Errol Flynn was the definitive Robin Hood should give this take a chance. OK nobody was as dashing and charming as Flynn in heroic swashbuckling roles but Crowe is a different Robin for a different time as was Costner's. Each version is good in its own way. If you like long movies with lots of details and that take their time to tell a good story (maybe sluggish for some), this one's for you. Battle scenes are impressive in scope and not overly gory, and it's worth the wait to see Mark Strong as the villain get his comeuppance from Robin, making up for a narrowly-missed earlier opportunity. Although this film underperfomed at the American box office, it did well enough around the world to make it a financial success, contrary to hearsay that it was a flop. My wife doesn't remember seeing the theatrical version because she said she couldn't have been impressed by it. LOL She had a different opinion this time so skip the theatrical version.

This Blu-ray combo is a bargain at such a low price. Another good pairing of Scott & Crowe plus with Blanchett  making for a powerhouse trio. The film is open for a sequel but I doubt one will be coming since it wasn't a mega hit. Otherwise, highly recommended.",1368230400,,3813,4.742081447963801

This version is a worthy entry in the chronicles of the outlaw of Sherwood Forest, both exciting and epic as it essentially gives a gritty account of the archer's origin.  Robin is introduced serving in the Holy Land under Richard the Lionheart.  The opening battle sequence is impressive, although certainly not unexpected considering director Ridley Scott's acomplishment with the Oscar winning Gladiator.  It's the Gladiator himself, Russell Crowe, as Robin Hood and he does a great job of fashioning a version of Hood who is human, heroic, but at all times alert and ready to act in desperate means.  The story has enough new turns to keep it fresh without feeling out of sync with the nature of the previous Hood tales.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is really only glimpsed here and there's no hope for Richard's return.  While perhaps not the definative version - for me that would be Flynn - it is a terrific film. Thanks to its mix of realism and adventure, it hits the target dead center.",1366243200,3,1060,4.791208791208791

There was never any lead up to a scene, you were just dumped into it on the fly.  I always felt like I just missed the scene that set up the one I was watching.

And ultimately, the movie fulfills what one would expect from the pair. I really enjoyed Robin Hood, except for the fact that he is only the beloved criminal for around the last two minutes of the movie. But the film was done in the expected massive scale, brilliant acting, and killer action sequences that Scott and Crowe bring to their movies. All in all, I do highly recommend, even if it does feel exactly like Gladiator haha.",1361232000,,577,4.838383838383838

4193888,4,B003U0AHBO,"Batman, Ironman, Robin Hood.  An unlikely trio? Theyre not so different.  To follow a recent revival of Batman (Batman Begins) and the beginning of a series of Ironman films, director Ridley Scotts Robin Hood conforms to the beginning theme.  Batman Begins and Ironman have shown viewers where our super heroes came from, but how did Robin Hood become a sniper with a bow, and why does he steal from the rich to give to the poor? Scott and writers Brian Helgeland, Ethan Reiff, and Cyrus Voris have created an entire film as a Robin Hood beginning movie, presenting the story of how Robin Longstride became Robin Hood. Scott and the writers, with the help of some excellent acting, do a satisfactory job of making the lengthy, action adventure film into a well plotted beginning movie.
Hats off to the actors, and even more so, to the casting for this film.  Russell Crowe is classic Crowe, a strong and inspiring leader with predictable excellence when the weapons are out and equally expected quotable statements and speeches.  The Robin Crowe plays is not as classic. The plot still centers around the strong, clever, commander Robin, fighting for rights of all Englishmen.  That is exactly what separates this Robin, less stealing from the rich and more fighting for the poor.  Fighting on the scale of for all England allows the film to have its large scale war scenes, which are, as usual in large scale productions such as this, full of the anticipated action with focused shots on Robin, his merry men.  These men who have some development and some depth thanks to the actors that play them face some equally satisfying villains.
The antagonists Godfrey the traitor; played by Mark Strong, and, even more so, Prince John; played by Oscar Isaac, sell their roles as villains worth hating.  Strong and Isaac impress, but Cate Blanchetts Marion Loxley is one to enjoy as well.  Blanchetts acting is quality, but Marions role in the story is more the surprise. Scott and the writers have made Lady Marion much less ladylike than some versions of Robin Hood prior to Blanchetts more valiant role.  This Marion triumphs in her effort to aid the people of Nottingham, as opposed to waiting for rescue from her troubles. These villains and heroin make the length of the Robins beginning.  But, impressive acting isn't all that makes this beginner entertaining; the crew behind the cameras does their part with equal skill.
The talent of the technical crew creates the full circle production that complements the acting.  The large battles scenes are as predictable as Robins skill with a bow and arrow, but the scale, execution, and camera work allow a feeling of immersion into the chaos of war.  The camera work fits the action well with fluid movements and frame changes allowing a real feel to the fighting without the dizzy effect some films produce with rapid and shaky cameras in moving scenes.  The orchestrated pieces are fitting and enriched by the original musical styles of Robins merry men. To complete the unconventional crew are the skillfully played Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) and Little John (Kevin Durand), who bring the adventure and comic relief that helps a viewer endure the lethargic plot.
Lethargy is one of the only issues with this film. It takes Robin Longstride an excessive amount of time to become Robin Hood.  The plot flows well, but as a viewer, the first thought after stretching out your sore, well used sitting muscles is that was long.  The quality acting and entertainment value of the film is the afterthought.  Unfortunate as that is, the movies alternative perspective on the characters we know makes it a worthwhile watch.  Its sloth speed; however, is what separates it from Batman Begins and Ironman, in which the creation of the heroes only lasts the first hour or so.. This methodic, two hour twenty minute film resolves where the general image of Robin Hood begins.  Be good and comfortable for this one when you sit down to watch.  Its worth its length.",1361145600,2,3997,4.857142857142857

I loved Cate Blanchett. She's never get old.
Russel Crow was well matched with the charactor. He always does.

Between this film, Master and Commander, Gladiator, and his recent work in Les Miserables he has a penchant for films with historical interest which appeals to me.

On that note, this film delivers - Good historically correct feeling battle scenes, political intrigue rooted in true history, and an ah-ha moment at the end when you realize you were watching a sort of... wait, I don't do spoilers.

4193907,3,B003U0AHBO,"I have always been enamored with the Robinhood tale and the way King John has always been the villain throughout history. As a novice student of history I have a different take especially on how Richard has always been lauded as a great king and leader but actually was a horrible king more interested in warring on his own blood and pursuing his personal needs then anything else, I mean he spent a year out of ten in England? Where John was viewed as a better king, at least from the sources I have read.

I liked a lot about this movie from the sets, to costuming, and the portrayal of the common man and woman in England. I especially enjoyed the acting done by Mark Strong, Kevin Durand, Max von Sydow, and blown away by Cate Baanchett. The movie lost me at the end when she was charging into battle, armored and leading a pack of young kids. Aside from that it was good, even though Crowes accent was horrible. I also got a kick out of Danny Huston as King Richard. If I ever had to imagine what the real Richard was like it would have been as Huston portrayed him as.",1358121600,,1074,4.264705882352941

4193930,5,B003U0AHBO,"I don't think I could dislike a movie with both Russell Crow and Cate Blanchette.  I think they are two of the very best actors working today.
I am also something of a Robin Hood junkie.  But this Robin Hood is way above the rest.  The history is, of course, as mangled as every other Robin Hood movie.  However, the the historical world they created is just about perfect.  I am sure there are odds and ends that don't fit the time period. but nothing glaring (like clean floors).
Most of all, I love Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchette as Robin and Marion.  They both do their their magical hoodoo and turn into completely new people.  They have both suffered from the consequences of those terrible crusades that drained England of virtually all it's money and far too many of it's young men.  Then they  had to suffer under King John, who really was as bad as all the Robin Hood movies make him out to be - and maybe worse.  They struggle to survive and try to make a decent life for themselves and those who depend on them.  Their romance is funny as they work their way from initial wariness to a bond that is strong and even comfortable,
If you want Errol Flynn, watch Errol Flynn.  But if you want a glimpse into a past world and some great acting, this is your bet.  I loved it.",1354665600,,1285,4.304166666666666
4193931,2,B003U0AHBO,"I picked this up for a few bucks in a used DVD bin and wondered why it was there.  Russell Crowe's a top-shelf actor and Ridley Scott has made many a blockbuster and Cate Blanchett is high quality, etc.  So I watched the movie to see what I could see.

What I saw was an inept scrambled eggs mess of a movie:
a lot of GLADIATOR, much of THE PATRIOT, silly stealings from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  The last ""borrowings"" were especially absurd: the French landing craft are almost identical to those which transported the troops to the beaches of Normandy in World War Two.  In this movie, the scenes of the beach landing and the soldiers flailing underwater weighted down with their chain-mail and getting hit by a fusillade of arrows is an embarrassing imitation of the opening sequence in Spielberg's film.  We are also led to believe that the ""Hood"" of Robin's last name is derived from ""the Hood"", the inner neighborhood in which he and his Merry Men thrived.  The truth is that the ""Hood"" much more actually refers to the head covering of the cloak Robin was won't to wear.  And risible is the scene where Cate Blanchett's Maid Marian is all armored up and ready to kick the ass of the big bald villain who killed her father - only to get knocked off her horse and get saved by Robin Hood.  Her fall from the saddle undermines the entire scene and makes one realize it would have been less insulting to the fair sex if it were left on the cutting room floor.

Settings and costuming and how it all is photographed are all pretty much in keeping with the times, but the contemporized script and the updated landing craft and the attempt to make ""hood"" timely all fall flat and cause to come to ruin what could have been a fairly good historical drama. But apart from all else, the one critical, crucial thing that should have been updated but obviously couldn't is Russell Crowe himself! He is much to old for those mythic tights! I had no idea when I popped this disc in that this long, basically boring movie was all just a prequel to the beginnings of the Robin Hood we all know and love - and that is Robin Hood, the Outlaw, the robber of the rich to give to the poor, etc.  Well, Crowe was 46 when this film was made - and that is a way bit past it to be be playing a legendary character who, after the two and a half hour movie, is found just beginning the career that will make him timeless.  Russell Crowe co-produced the movie - and he should have stayed behind the scenes for this one and let some young buck try to bring it home.

One other thing: Cate Blanchett (as Cate Blanchett) pontificates in one of the extras and says that Russell Crowe is the first man to truly play Robin Hood and that all the other portrayals were somewhat fey.  I don't suppose she ever saw Sean Connery in ROBIN AND MARIAN or even Errol Flynn as the definitive Robin Hood.  Oh, well.  Talk is cheap.

4193950,5,B003U0AHBO,"Of course, its just a movie.  You cannot expect any movie to tell the complete truth.  But this one did - for the most part.  The story begins with King Richard ""the Lion-heart"" feeling betrayed by having been abandoned by King Phillip II of France who abandoned the English king during the Crusades.  The reason was because Phillip felt his duty was to France - his father Phillip I had died - and France needed a King.  So Lion-heart on the way home attacks a string of strongholds (castles) along southern France.  Here the King is shot with an arrow, and due to bad medical practices of the day - dies of gangrene.  This is one example of good research making a good film.  Many ""Robin Hoods"" have depicted the Lion-hearts return to England.  It never happened.

4193952,1,B003U0AHBO,"Do not take history or literature lessons from this movie.

A movie made by NBCU...which is a company that Orwell couldn't have even made up. Remember 'Running Man'...NBCU is the real-life version of the ""network"".

A movie by Ridley Scott....extreme left-wing liberal that intentionally re-writes history for political reasons (see 1984).

Anybody that knows history knows the Crusaders were extremely Christian. Extremely! The knights were like hardcore Samaria-style Christian fighters. They mastered the Western martial arts (see ARMA publications). The knights were nobles that started learning to fight at 8 years old; they were highly Christian indoctrinated. They were pretty hard to fight too....they thought it was unfair to fight an enemy if the enemy didn't have greater than 3-1 superiority.

The Ridley Scott liberal-progressive-rewrite-history camp wants you to believe that a Robert Loxley (or any crusader) would be dieing and thank ""the fates"". (The fates???!!!)

No.

These liberals are so determined to rewrite history and lore....so determined to exterminate Christianity....that they want you to believe Christian Crusaders prayed to fates (karma etc) instead of....ohhh geeee whizzz.....Christ? Come the hell on!

A movie about a crusader that never mentions Christ. Ok.

Also, a movie after 1066 that has the king and all the royalty speaking English.....??? After 1066 (Battle of Hastings), England was controlled by Normans (and France). All the nobility in England spoke French or French creoles (is why 15% of American English is French words). Richard the Lionheart and King John were famous for not knowing, and not speaking, any English.

Why is a movie taking place when French royalty controlled England going to war with France? Because it is a Ridley Scott movie that has no basis on reality.

More liberals re-writing history. (Kind of like another Ridely Scott movie: Kingdom of Heaven. Where Saladin is portrayed as a nice peace-loving king....a guy that would cut your head off for being an infidel. Thanks Ridley...)

4193963,4,B003U0AHBO,"Ridley Scott can flat out make movies.  They're gritty, compelling, violent, often grotesque, and they possess a rugged, material realism.  To see a table of food in a lord's hall teeming with rats engorging themselves while two men are engaged in conversation and oblivious to the vermin is Ridley Scott to the max.  And Scott's version of ROBIN HOOD is an adventuresome tale that focuses more on the political machinations that create ROBIN HOOD the outlaw; there's not much robbing from the rich to give to the poor (what's known nowadays as wealth redistribution)--instead, the story portrays a thwarted French invasion of England, along with a corrupt king's betrayal.  The ending--if one would care to call it that--lends itself to a sequel, perhaps giving us the story of ROBIN HOOD universally familiar to all.  And such a sequel would be eagerly welcomed by this reviewer.

The cast is superb; Scott has a knack for getting Russell Crowe's ""A"" game, and this film is no exception.  Cate Blanchett is equally good as Marion Loxley, although her participation in the climactic battle scene requires far too much suspension of disbelief.  The supporting cast is stellar, which includes heavyweights William Hurt and Max von Sydow; other noteworthy performances are turned in by Mark Strong, Oscar Isaac, and Eileen Atkins.  But I especially enjoyed Robin's hearty band of misfits, including Kevin Durand (Little John), Mark Addy (Friar Tuck), Scott Grimes (Will Scarlett), and Alan Doyle (Allan A'Dayle).  These performers furnish the story's essential comic relief, and their chemistry is as fluid as it is believable.  Scott gives--as usual--stunning visuals and sweeping vistas; ROBIN HOOD is a rousing adventure and a whole lot of fun.

I paid for the HD version yet was forced to watch the regular version.  Not a big deal.  Maybe just cable internet was bogged down, but Netflix was working just fine at the same time, so not sure what to think.

Either way, the movie was a bit slow at times and hard to follow.  It seemed like the movie relied on your prior knowledge of the characters and who they are to really appreciate what the movie was trying to do at times.  My Girlfriend had to explain characters and who they were in order to make it all come together.  I started falling asleep after about 1:45 in, so I can't rate how it finished.  I can tell you that it's nothing like Gladiator as one of the reviews stated. lol",1335139200,,829,4.19620253164557
4193965,4,B003U0AHBO,"Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have now done four movies together, the most notable of which is undoubtedly Gladiator, a fantastic story, and a brilliantly realised movie in the tradition of Braveheart.

With Robin Hood director and actor would face a story and a character, portrayed many times in movies and tv series. Robin Hood has been played by actors as diverse as Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Patrick Bergin and Errol Flynn. Even Mel Brooks did a series Robin Hood Men in tights.

Inevitably, if you are like me, you will make comparisons with your other experiences of Robin Hood. Bravely, it attempts to tell the story in a fresh and invigorating way, exploring the story before the story you already know.

Firstly, in this story Robin Hood is not yet Robin Hood, but Robin Longstride, a man of uncertain origin and we suspect less than noble birth, and we meet him on the battlefields of France, fighting the cause of King Richard. Robin calls out the King's reckless crusade, and Robin and his three friends end up in the stocks, and so the adventure begins.

Eventually, Robin and his men escape, and Robin assumes the identity of a dying nobleman, and agrees to carry out his last wish, which leads him to Lady Marion.

Usually King Richard plays as a heroic character still abroad, and Prince John remains a scheming prince. Here however John becomes the King, and undergoes somewhat of an unlikely transformation from weakling mamas boy Prince to tyrant King.

This presents a dilemma in accepting the story as given. Sometimes while watching this movie, particuarly action scenes you may feel like you are watching Braveheart or Gladiator.

Apparently, Russell Crowe walked out of a BBC radio interview, when the British presenter, suggested his accent was Irish not English, Russell responding bollocks, and telling 'you got dead ears, mate.' You got to love Russell.

Being Irish myself, I did think there was one scene where he had a slight lilt, other than that I found nothing wrong with the accent. In any event, I don't think Sean Connery has ever done anything other than a Scottish accent, even when he won the Academy Award playing an Irish policeman with a Scottish accent.

I think most people will enjoy it. If the story elements had been more consistent with other versions I definitely would have enjoyed it more.

What I liked most about this movie was him releasing the arrow in slow motion with drops of water flying off, and I also like the Little John character, who you may recognise as a villain from Lost.

4193968,1,B003U0AHBO,"On the one hand, the character of Robin Hood cannot truly be known since he is really an amalgam of many outlaws created during 1200 AD - 1300 AD, 100 years of social and political unrest in England.  Not only that, but the characters so dear to the retelling of the story, such as Maid Marian and Jolly Friar Tuck were introduced as add-ons through the cultural retelling of the story during May Day games over many hundreds of years thereafter.  As to even where Robin's hideout was, no one really knows.  Some say West Yorkshire, others say Sherwood Forest.

What I objected to mostly was the fabrication of a ""definitive"" plotline against the backdrop of an unknowable history and then, contorting history to place the French as the 'bad guys' when the English Normans were equally the protagonists during this era!  Somehow Robin gets swept up in the events of the time as an ""archer"", when historical accounts credit him to be a ""yeoman"" and not necessarily in the service of any king.  That he is supposedly a son of a stonemason adduces additional stretching of the truth.

Far from being historically accurate, the movie draws bold lines where gray would be closer to the truth.  Richard, as Duke of Normandy went WITH Philip II to campaign against Saladin during the Third Crusade.  Philip actually favored the princes Richard and John initially, in order to get them on his side against their father, Henry II.  Philip then retired from the Crusade, leaving his troops under the authority of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy.  The rift between Philip and Richard was actually caused by a woman, Alys, Philip's sister, whom Richard had broken off engagement to at Messina, prior to joining the Crusade.  Philip then campaigned to restore the Vexin and the fortress of Gisors by force, which was originally Alys' dowry to Richard.  William Marshal, in contrast with the movie, was never ""dismissed"" as seneschal but remained a loyal royal supporter both of Richard and John rather than going over to the barons.  Richard wasn't killed immediately after the Crusade but, being released from imprisonment in February, 1194, took 300 ships in May, 1194 to Normandy to attack Philip (the movie claims Philip attacked John by sea in England).  Richard was killed in 1199 as part of his reconquest of Normandy, which had nothing to do with the Crusade.

It was actually not just baronial intrigue that generated the Magna Carta but King John's disastrous campaign at the river Lys, near the Bridge of Bovines in 1214 that sealed his fate in history and caused the ascendancy of the French king over the Norman vassals.  A better movie could have been made using the actual history (English Normans attacking the French to salvage their French landholdings) rather than reversing the flow of history (French attacking the English Normans) and attempting to interject Robin Hood as essential and pivotal to the outcome!  This movie is fantasy rather than reality and, created despite historical events offering a better plotline than what the writers' imagined and repackaged!",1330905600,8,3071,4.930097087378641

The reason for that I think is this: if your expecting the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, this isn't it. Totally different on all fronts. However, this is one of my favorite Ridley Scott movies (next to Alien and Legend of course). The acting is spot on, the scenes are epic and accurate, and the story is riveting. It has all the classic ""hero"" moments, but also a few surprises that give this movie a very real kind of feeling. It has some laughs, and some great battle scenes, even Russel Crowe doesn't come across as annoying, rather quite heroic but not in a smarmy way (im not a big fan of Russel Crowe). I feel that this movie, like so many of Ridley Scott's others, will gain more credit as the years go by. Definatly worth owning this movie!

While this film is a prequel to the more popular story of Robin Hood, it does take a very different turn than did other Robin Hood films. That's what made this film so interesting to watch; to see all the characters you know so well placed in a completely different role than seen before. That was a very enjoyable part of the movie. Aside from that, the film was a bit lacking. I admit that this was not up to the usual par of Ridley Scott, and I was expecting better from him.
The actors, especially Russel Crowe and Cate Blanchett, perform very well in this film and definitely carry the movie through some of it's blandness and clichs. While the two main characters and Blanchett's father go through a great deal of character development, the other characters just wander around the movie doing as they are told. You really hope to see character development with Little John, Will Scarlet, Allan A'Dayle and Friar Tuck, but are dissappointed by the lack thereof.
The enemies of the film are threatening enough and convincing in their evil roles, but I admit that I certainly enjoy the embittered Alan Rickman and comical Peter Ustinov versions of Little John better than the winy, spoiled Prince John that we are presented with in this film (It's probably obvious, but I really, really like Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and it's hard for other Robin Hoods attempts to top it).

**Spoiler Alert**
I also have to admit that the final arrow shot that killed Godfrey in the end was way too ridiculous to be believable. The fact that Robin was able to shoot Godfrey through the neck from a very far distance while the villain was riding away on a horse amongst great coastal winds and with a soaked bow and arrow is just too much. I would have even been okay with it if he just got him through the heart via the back; but that triumphant shot was just far too over-the-top for me to accept. There were just too many factors that would make that an impossible shot.
**End Spoiler Alert**

Overall, the film is worth seeing at least once, but not purchase-worthy in my book.

As far as questionable content:
There is a quick flash of a soldier and servant girl having sex amidst the battlegrounds towards the beginning. There is also a very awkward sex scene with Prince John and his French fling towards the beginning in which you see a flash of female nipple as well as an eyeful of Prince John's buttocks. Aside from that, some scenes of violence.

4193975,2,B003U0AHBO,"I was anticipating watching this film because since childhood I've always been a fan of Robin Hood movies, from Errol Flynn to Kevin Costner and Sean Connery.  This $20 million rendition has a phenomenal cast wasted on a flaccid script.  I am stunned director Ridley Scott has lost his touch for compelling filmaking. ""Gladiator"" is about 12 years old, and I've seen it a zillion times and it still holds up with every viewing - a true classic.

  Unfortunately Ridley Scott's rendition of Robin Hood falls flat as a pancake.  The film opens with a textbook version of a paint-by-the numbers battle scene - then moves to the mother of the King of England grumpy because her son has not produced an heir with his wife but is sleeping with what she calls ""A French Piece of Pastry"" - the niece of the French king.  From that scene it is downhill, and when I realized this is a cartoon-ish rendition of the classic Robin Hood tale.  Most of the film is just violent, violent, violent.  If you are into endless battle scenes and like violence - you might enjoy this film.  There are battle scenes with no explanation what circumstances lead up to the cause of the battle.

  Cate Blanchette is given little to do except act ""feisty"" when improbably she dressed up in knights armour at the close of the film and does her duty in battle to defend the realm.  There is no chemistry between Cate Blanchette and Russel Crowe - they are both excellent actors and the problem in this film must be the director, Ridley Scott never embodies any part of the film with compelling interest to hold the viewer.  I never felt a pulse beat in the scenes between Cate Blanchette and Robin Hood - they don't really seem to have any romantic heat - the sort of feeling bewteen arranged marriages is what I felt from them, nothing resembling true lovers.

  What a waste of an absolutely terrific cast - if a director can't make an interesting film with the likes of Max Von Sydown, Mark Strong, Mark Addy, Cate Blanchette and Russel Crowe then he needs to retire from film making.

  It's OK if you've got some spare time on a rainy afternoon and it's on cable TV, but I wouldn't buy the DVD or waste a space in my Netflix queue for this stale re-hash of a classic tale.  If you want to see a rollicking romp of the Robin Hood tale - even the 1940's old chestnut with Errol Flynn is more gripping.  For a comical lighter version of Robin Hood, the Kevin Costner version ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" is wonderful - Alan Rickman absolutely steals the film as Sherrif of Notthingham - a memorable rendition of comic villianary as the ""Man You Love to Hate.""  ""Robin and Marion"" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn as a middle aged version of the hero and heroine is also a better version than this Ridley Scott mish-mash.",1325980800,,2799,4.4970297029702975

4193979,3,B003U0AHBO,"Well, this is probably going to be the last pairing of Crowe and Scott for some time; a $200 million budget blown on a confused - albeit well intentioned - origin piece.  In a way, it's not all wasted time for the duo - if this is a commercial flop like Scott's last medieval-driven effort, Kingdom of Heaven, he may look to directing an Alien prequel far more quickly.  Gladiator was a pleasant fluke, guys.

Not that I should be one to be analyzing Scott's portrayal of the iconic english outlaw.  My earliest and strongest memories of robin hood still reside alongside cartoony foxes and Cary Elwes.  But I don't need a hand on the backstory to know that Robin Hood's story is one that's meant to embody the spirit of adventure, courage, and heroism in the face of injustice.  And there's really not much of that here.  The scope feels smaller than it actually is, and that'd be okay if the little scenes felt as if they had any real depth or enthusiasm kicked into them.

Instead, we're left with something that's as flat as a pancake and not nearly ambitious enough to warrant much interest aside from good performances and high production values.  Perhaps it was restrained in order to provide authenticity and historical accuracy, but even that falls way short of standards when things start to get a little sloppy midway through, eventually coalescing to make a wholly implausible conclusion that may or may not aid in the making of a sequel.  I can't immediately say if I want one or not.

The performances are certainly worthy of digging, though.  Say what you will of Crowe and his short fuse on and off the set, he still the go-to ruffian role player.  Mark Strong, the only villain that we get the satisfaction of seeing slain, is just popping up everywhere these days, and I can't really say that I'm discouraged by that.  He's got a future, for sure, and if his supporting efforts remain this consistent, a lead role is in the books.  Veterans Blanchett, Hurt and  the immaculate Von Sydow share little screen time (actually, I don't think Hurt ever manages to get in the way more than I would've liked him to), but are a joy to watch, nonetheless.  Danny Huston, a personal favorite of mine, also makes an appearance as the doomed King Richard, but the film's excessive length means that you'll likely have forgotten about him by the time the credits begin to roll.

But the real draw should have been Ridley Scott, who's directorial hit-or-miss margins seem to be growing more whacky by the year.  The guy's a visionary, but it seems as if the new generation of filmmaking isn't gelling well with him.  His heart still belong's to science fiction, even if he doesn't know it yet.",1324166400,,2696,4.623949579831932

4193982,1,B003U0AHBO,"If you do a little research, you'll discover that the original screenplay for this movie was called ""Nottingham.""  It was superbly unique and followed the sheriff as the protagonist (instead of Robin Hood) with tons of period research, original direction, and excellent storytelling.  In fact, the script was so good that everyone wanted it!

The bad news was that Ridley Scott got it.  Now, Ridley Scott is a terrific director but he makes big mistakes (see also the theatrical versions of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"", which aren't a tenth as good as the revamps).  What did Scott do?  He erased everything original from the script and made it just another bland rehashing of the same ol' Robin Hood.

This movie is completely flat and the scene of Marian in armor, charging into battle, is so laughably absurd that I have to believe someone held a gun to Scott's head and forced him to include it.  Scott's desperate attempts to make medieval characters act with 21st century ideals is all the more ridiculous because there's virtually no character development in this film--and I'm speaking of both the theatrical and the unrated versions, which really aren't all that different.

If you're expecting a totally different, much better movie here (like you got with the director's cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven""), prepare to be disappointed.  This movie is derivative, unoriginal, and offensively stupid.  I feel very sorry for the writer of the original screenplay!",1323388800,39,1474,5.0246913580246915
4193983,4,B003U0AHBO,"What a superb movie. It's too bad that this offering/update of the Robin Hood story fared poorly at the box office. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are stellar and their supporting cast also does a wickedly good job.

I honestly hope Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe can find a way to get a sequel to the screen. (I'm not hopeful however.... I believe there's a ready audience for Crowe to reprise his role as Captain Jack Aubrey from Patrick O'Brien's 18th-century British navy series, but that movie (""Master and Commander - the far Side of the World"") also fared poorly at the box office and I don't think there are any plans for a sequel.)

While we can quibble about 21st-century politics being projected back on to events of a millennium earlier, there are some valuable points we citizens and our politicians should heed (even if the ""teaching points"" are more than somewhat anachronistic).

We would do well to remember that wealth is generated by the individual and government should be in the business (pardon the purposeful pun) of protecting individual initiative and effort. When government is in the business of squeezing out every last penny (whether real or perceived) or begins to feel (as ours in the U.S. seems to be acting) that the citizenry exists to fund a massively-bloated, special-interests budget, the Common Good suffers and prosperity tanks.

Not sure where Scott and Crowe stand vis-a-vis Ayn Rand, but many of the fundamental points Rand makes in ""Atlas Shrugged"" are echoed quite loudly in ""Robin Hood."" If intended, kudos! If not, I'm thrilled for the unintentional plug for Libertarianism/Objectivism.

Our government was founded on the principle of government protecting the individual's rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (economic and social mobility thru opportunity)."" Does our government still do this? Yes, but less so each and every day. Sorry if this causes offense - but Barack Obama sounds more and more like King John each day. And Congress acts more and more like royal lapdogs each day - especially the Democratic Party. The Tea Party was criticized for pushing the debt ceiling issue. But they were right to do so. If they hadn't, it would have been ""business as usual"" in Washington.

Talk is cheap and promises to bring down the national debt have so far been empty promises. The northern barons of ""Robin Hood"" put aside principle in order to defend England from French attack based solely on King John's word that he would sign a charter acknowledging royal respect of basic individual liberties. We saw how the movie ended and that too is our end if we don't push for real action from our political leaders.

4193987,4,B003U0AHBO,"I'll admit I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this new 'Robin Hood' film. I loved Ridley Scott's 'Kingdom of Heaven' but the trailers for 'Robin Hood' made it seem like a missguided attempt to slap the famous name on another 'Gladiator'-clone. I was very surprised to find out that not only is it a good movie, it actually manages to capture some of the fun of the older Robin Hood stories!

'Robin Hood' takes place in 1199 and follows Robin Longstride, an archer for Richard I in his war against France. After deserting, Robin and a few other soldiers travel to Nottingham where he meets Lady Marian and unlocks secrets to his past. All the while the french are planning a big invasion and are manipulating Richard I's brother John to create unrest in england. There's obviously a lot of plot to 'Robin Hood' as well as some gritty historical detail, but the film actually comes off best when it's being fun and focuses on the familiar characters of the Robin Hood legend. I was very surprised at how likeable the main heroes were and the light-humored dialogue brings back fond memories of Errol Flynn. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the french invasion finale which seemed straight out of 'Saving Private Ryan' and ruined the otherwise playful mood of the film.

The cast in 'Robin Hood' is solid down the middle. Russell Crowe is a proven action-hero and while he might seem a bit old for the part he's a very rough and charming Robin. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as Marian and her verbal-dueling with Robin is a treat! Max von sydow practically steals the film as Marian's blind father-in-law who knows more about Robin's past than anyone else. Mark Strong (as always) does solid villain work as Sir Godfrey.

While the light-hearted story moments might not mesh well with the violent action the camerawork in 'Robin Hood' is absolutely stunning! The actions scenes are exciting as usual but the locales (filmed in Wales) really sell the setting and make the film a place you want to get lost in!

'Robin Hood' has a few short-comings but it's overall a worthwhile film. It does enough different with the Robin Hood legend that it feels unique and still manages to keep the more familiar stories' sense of fun and adventure (and doesn't feel the need to fall back on 'Ivanhoe' for inspiration).",1316908800,2,2316,4.711111111111111

4194001,5,B003U0AHBO,"One of the reasons that the legend of Robin Hood and his Merry Men has had a lasting impact on the world for nearly six centuries is that the story always adapts to the times in which it is told. And so it does again with the Ridley Scott-directed ""Robin Hood."" This version presents an origin story of the Hooded man, from an archer in King Richard's army returning from the Crusade, to being declared an outlaw by Richard's brother, King John.

What sets this version of the story apart is that it attempts to place the story within more of an historical setting. And while it does play with some of the historical facts (Scott has done it before with ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""), it overall succeeds at doing so. All the elements of the legend are there: The relationship between Robin and Marion; the Merry Men (Allan A'Dale, Will Scarlett, and Little John); the evil Prince John (Who becomes king in this version) and Sheriff of Nottingham (Less of a figure in this version); Sherwood Forest, among others. But there are elements of history thrown in for good measure as well. Most significant here is that we see the origins of the Magna Carta, the charter of liberties that the real King John was forced to sign by the nobles in 1215. In the film, Robin's father had a hand in its creation, and Robin takes up the call for the charter to be signed by the king, but to no avail in the confines of the story being told.

As for the film itself, it is the best of the Robin Hood movies that have been made. While it does have a darker and grittier feel to it, it still has the fun and excitement necessary in any telling of the legend. The acting is superb, the storytelling well-handled, and the battle scenes are quick-paced and exciting. While some of the history is skewered a bit, it still fits well into the overall perspective of the film.

The Blu-ray release is fantastic, featuring near-perfect picture and sound, and a good amount of extras. If you loved the movie, then you'll equally love the Blu-ray edition of ""Robin Hood!""

4194004,5,B003U0AHBO,"Rather than basing this version of Robin Hood on any of the ancient legends about this fictional character, the film makers of this excellent, well acted, and dramatic movie base their totally different version in small part upon actual history. Robin is not the fine, nice, gentleman portrayed in the other films, but a low class expert archer who is a crook with a conscious, who accompanies King Richard on his crusade to Palestine and participates somewhat reluctantly in the king's robberies and slaughters both in Palestine and on his return trip to England when the king and his rag tag army destroy cities, murder people, rob them, and rape women. When the king and one of his principle knights are killed, Robin disguises himself as the king's knight and returns to England hoping to use the disguise to accumulate wealth. However, he discovers that the knight has a wife, Marian, and he comes in conflict with the heavy-handed murdering King John, who succeeds his brother Richard, and who, like Richard, has his men kill and plunder fellow English people. Robin and John also have to face King Phillip of France who is attacking England with the same despicable goals in mind.

 Other than the character of John, the depiction of the time, and the attack by the French, this is all fiction. But the movie portrays the reactions of the Barons to King John's acts and their insistence that he sign a document that diminishes his arbitrary authority, his ability to kill and plunder at will, that at least the freemen, but not serfs, cannot be punished except by law. John agrees to it, but then reneges. This is where the film ends.

 However, the Barons were able to force John to sign the document later - which came to be called the Magna Carta, the Great Charter - in 1215. John dies in 1216. The Magna Carta is modified somewhat in 1297 and becomes, many English people feel, the basic constitution of the land.",1306886400,,1925,4.720238095238095

Having been raised on the Errol Flynn traditional version I found it hard to accept what I was seeing in the ads for the movie. Had to watch it a few times before everything started to jell in my mind. Basically, since the Robin Hood saga are probably folk tales anyway, (although there are OE stories about a Robin Hood) I finally accepted the Russell Crowe Robin Hood as just more of the fantasy that envelopes the whole saga down through the centuries. This Robin Hood could be called a pre-quel to all the others. Since no stories exist about how Robin came to be an outlaw in the forest, this movie filled in admirably with a very believable story about his life before outlawhood.  Russell Crowe did a great job as Robin Longstride, and Cate Blanchett was a outstanding Lady Marian. (this part belies the Maid Marian parts of the other interpretations of the saga.)
  So the movie turned me from being a critic of the basic plot to a huge fan of the movie once I got it settled in my mind where it fit into the big picture.

4194012,5,B003U0AHBO,"This is not a simple remake of the beloved Robin Hood film starring Errol Flynn. This is a gritty, fresh reinterpretation of that classic tale.  While Flynn's movie was a family film told with the innocence of a childhood fable, this version is a realistic portrayal of medieval life and warfare. I loved the scene where even in the house of a rich noble, the country mice scrambled over the leftovers on the table, with one actually dangling over the side of the fruit bowl as Robin and his father sat chatting mere feet away. Genius! The battle scenes were also starkly real. When King Richard laid siege to the castle we see how the foot soldiers struggled in the muck to advance only a few feet in every attack, and just how cheap life was in war. Best of all was the invasion. It was reminiscent of the famous beach landing scenes in Saving Private Ryan. Action movie fans will not be disappointed!
This story is much more adult than any other version, and much more intricate, with a complicated plot full of exciting twists and political intrigue. The characters are also much more deeply developed.  Russell Crowe's performance is under-stated, and yet his character dominates the screen. You can't stop yourself from rooting for him. Cate Blanchett also gives a remarkable performance as the strong-willed Lady Marion. You can read the emotion on her face as her feelings for Robin change from reluctance to acceptance to admiration and to desire.
The only flaw in this entire film was that it fell victim to the thought police, who insist on re-writing the roles of women in history to fit their ideology. Despite the fact that the film portrays Lady Marion as a strong-willed and self-reliant, capable woman, they still felt it was necessary for this audience for her to show up at the battlefield dressed in chain mail and helmet, and attack her father's killer. This of course forced Robin Hood to ride to her rescue to save her...in slow motion. This soap opera scene almost spoiled a superb movie, the best of the year!",1301788800,,2034,4.71067415730337
4194013,4,B003U0AHBO,"The critics deadpanned this addition to the Robin Hood film library, choosing to mostly focus on Crowe's ""incorrect"" accent and lament the sacking of the original script that saw the Sheriff as the hero and Robin as the villain. Reviews like that immediately set off alarm bells that perhaps these nitpickings were smoke screens. Afterall, who was alive in the late 12th century to tell us that the persona didn't have an Irish or Welsh flavoured accent? Why should the Robin Hood legend bow to 21st century story-telling conventions that grey villains and make heroes out to be the real misguided folk? (Although ironically the latter isn't far from today's truth.)

Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed the version that was actually made (being this one), I understand why H-wood was disappointed. Crowe's 'Robin' isn't championing the redistribution of wealth and stands up for Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--the very ideals that would lead to the Magna Carta (the patriarch to America's own founding documents).The only other Robin Hood film to do this was 1938's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood/dp/B0013N3DSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;with Errol Flynn.

Cate Blanchette brings as much gravitas to the Marian role as did Olivia de Havilland in '38. She's no easy mark for Robin and it takes the full length of the film for Robin to turn her eyes in a way that isn't a distrustful glare. I thought the touch at the end may have been a bit of a cow-tow to feminism and unrealistic to the period, but it was tasefully handled and in no way detracted from the story.

My biggest gripe with the story was Scott's disappointing representation of the Crusades in film (again) and Richard's wars with the French. It's especially disappointing given the filmmaker's clear love for the long ago. I don't know.. maybe the studio forces such a period film to criticize the Crusades and be apologetic about Europe's role.

The opening title card tells us that the film starts after King Richard has returned from his ""plundering"" during the Third Crusade and is making war on the French, who decided to take some of his lands while he was gone (under the duplitious watch of King Phillip, an ever present rival of Richard's throughout most of his life). In the case of the latter events--umm, isn't Richard simply being a good king by making war on those who would steal from him?

But in the case of the Crusade, Scott lingers a bit longer, making sure that the audience knows that in his opinion, the killing of 2500 Muslims at Acre was ""godless"". The interesting thing here is that Scott would have us infer that the majority of those killed were women and children (quite the opposite in reality) and that he simply killed them for no reason (also untrue). In both cases, Scott stands at odds with most historians! But that isn't even the most important of the case.

Within the context of the time, it is the concensus of scholars that Richard had little choice but to kill the prisoners. First, because he was leaving Acre and he couldn't have the men (who comprised the majority of the prisoners) joining up with Saladin to fight against him. Second, because Saladin had been stalling for time to regain his strength for an attack, and was playing games with an agreed upon prisoner exchange. Third, the prisoner exchange (which was to include the True Cross captured at Hattin) technically had been agreed to by a lesser-officer without Saladin's kowledge and it wasn't an agreement he particularly liked. And fourth, Richard may have wanted a bit of revenge for the hundreds of Templar and Hospitaller captives that Saladin had had beheaded (by amateur soldiers no less) following Hattin (see Scott's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-of-Heaven-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000ICLRIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)</a>).

The most interesting of all is that records, written by a known Muslim archivist of Saladin's army, speaks of the Acre incident very matter-of-factly.. as if he understood the decision and would have done likewise in a similar position of war. And later on, when Richard and Saladin come to terms at Jaffa, they deal with each other honorably--as if the Acre incident wasn't so much of an issue. This is significant given the long memory of the Muslim warrior.

These departures from history must be known in order to appreciate just how good this film could have been had Scott made a film that brought these issues to the viewer.

What the film doesn't depart from is a wonderful portrayal of the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that would come from England's Magna Carta, and go on to influence the men who would bring democracy to the West centuries later; the film also remains true to the source material in that the story is NOT a commentary on class warfare (rob from rich to give to poor), that has burdened so many Robin Hood adaptations since Flynn's, but on the relationship of citizens and government.

The audio and video of the blu-ray edition is fantastic to superb; the extras aren't bad, but there's no commentary from Scott, Crowe, and/or Blanchette?!

Although the film bows the head a bit to modern filmmaking conventions (e.g. the Crusades were simply white Christian guys looting the world, killing ""innocent"" Muslims along the way, and robbing the Islamic community of its 'rightful lands'), it's refreshing to see a modern filmmaker get the Robin Hood legend closer to historical than any other. It was interesting to see a film that told a bit of a prequel than the story everyone mosly knows. Crowe's Robin Hood fits quite nicely beside my Errol Flynn version.",1301788800,2,5834,5.124079915878023

4194015,2,B003U0AHBO,"I Have to admit that this DVD was a purchase on impulse. I saw the cover and the Robin Hood name on it and I thought why not ? Now, a new Robin Hood version is out it couldn't be 'THAT' Bad now could it ? Well, I was wrong.

I'm not gonna rehearse the plot (not that there is one anyway) but I'm gonna explain my reasons for disliking this movie. Keep in mind that this film is intended to be about ""Robin Hood"" does that name sound familiar ? The Prince of thieves who steal from the rich and give to the poor. So, Bear with me:

-Reason #1 : Robin Hood wore ""Green"" that's right, it was green he didn't wear black, yellow or purple he wore Green. In this movie We see our ""Robin Hood"" which is played by ""Russell Crow"" wearing Black I don't even recall him wearing ""Green"". I'm not really sure why is that, can it be possible that the director was lacking of Green fabric.

-Reason #2 :Robin Hood was a man in his 20s not in his 40s, which is why the casting of ""Russell Crow"" as ""Robin Hood"" is horrible. Don't get me wrong, I like Russell Crow I enjoy most of his movies and I think he's a great actor but for him to play the role of a 20 year old young Robin Hood while he's obviously in his prime is inconvenient. I would've accepted the casting choice if he played an Old Robin Hood but this is about a Robin Hood that has just started his Robin Days and the legend has him as a young man not in his 40s. The same thing applies to Maid Marion, she was young, never married and therefore never widowed. Now Cate Blanchett is beautiful but she's a little bit old for the role of Maid Marion.

-Reason # 3: The ""Merry Men"" were Outlaws living in the forest, That's right, they were Men not children. Again another wrong casting choice. ""Did Mr. Scott got things messed up or what ?""

-Reason # 4: Robin Hood fought the lords of England, stole their money and gave it to the poor. The Lords of England were his real enemies and so was the King. He was an outlaw, never fought for the King and he didn't give a dam* about the French.

So, Yeah those were my Reasons for disliking this movie and I would've happily ignored these inaccuracies about Robin Hood if and only if the movie was ""entertaining"". However, the movie was not ! It was boring and long. I just couldn't get myself to like any of the characters especially that stupid King. I couldn't believe I was watching a Robin Hood movie, there was no stealing from the rich or giving to the poor what soever. I even had to check the Disc's title a couple of times just to make sure the title was ""Robin Hood"" not Robin Wood or maybe Rood or anything like that.

Mr. Scott I understand that you wanted to make an Original version of Robin Hood but couldn't you at least kept ""some"" facts straight instead of making an entire story up ? Or better Yet made an entire new fictional character named Robin instead of Robin Hood ? Who used to fight the French and work for the King. The events of this movie could've happen to anyone there was really nothing that made me feel connected to the actual Robin Hood except the names.

If you want to watch a Robin Hood movie, I recommend you see the Kevin Costner version I don't know why everyone hates it but it's definitely better than this crap ! I also recommend you watch the Robin Hood Men in Tights it's the better one of the three and it's funny and entertaining. If you didn't like it you can always watch the Disney Robin Hood, I know he's a wolf but he actually wears Green and he looks young !

This movie however wasn't even satisfying on the action part, the only fighting scenes were at the very end and they weren't enough ! I've seen Ridley Scott do better than this. If you want to watch a good Scott film a better movie would be Gladiator, the main character is played by Russell Crow also and the plot is more entertaining and memorable. It also has more fighting/action scenes.",1300838400,3,3898,4.2005347593582885

While I know that Ridley Scott took liberties with history, I'm not bothered by it.  Let go of historical accuracies, if there can be such a thing in a fable, and forget all past versions.  This is an incomparable story of knighthood, chivalry, and romance.  Robin has never looked better; Marion is a feminist gem.  The settings are gorgeous; the music is sublime.

4194018,5,B003U0AHBO,"Finally, a Robin Hood film that has a plot!  Ridley Scott's Single-Disc Unrated Director's Cut of ""Robin Hood"" (2010) sets the standard for future screen plays for this 12th century English hero.  Featuring an all star cast and filmed principally in Pembrokeshire this riveting flick is so much more than the usual swash-buckling save-Maid-Marion movie attempts of the past.

Crowe, Blanchett, MacFadyen, Von Sydow, Hurt and the rest give stellar performances.  Costuming, fight scenes (one is the English Channel surf), village life (including arcane songs sung badly by the actors), and even the reeds across all the indoor floors give this film the feeling of, if not an eye witness to, 12th century life.

And the plot is interesting and exciting (""Robin Hood's"" two hours passes quickly even with the additions from the director's cut).  Robin does much more than save Marion- he saves the realm for the ungrateful King John.  It concludes as the Robin Hood legends begin.  It is fun to watch the director's impressions for the siege of castles.  It is interesting how large groups of chain-mailed soldiers might have moved down narrow muddy wagon rut ""roads"" heading into battle.  Costumes here are rugged, thread-bare, and often dirty (like they must have been 800 years ago).  Scott's vision here shows English hard living in 1199 (this treatment is useable for teaching the 12th century).  Beware portions of this film reflect the barbarous nature of that age.  There's lots of blood (but little gore) in the various battle scenes.

Refreshingly, Director Scott seems intent to tell the story rather than mucking up this great film with foul language and skin.  Among the cursing, there's no profanity.  The lines of good and bad are clearly drawn.  Robin's and Marion's playful romance features no bed scenes or body parts.  In the end, at the very end, Robin wins fair Marion's heart as they vanquish evil side by side.  Even religion gets a hardy nod through the affable and clever warrior-monk Friar Tuck.  What more could one ask for from a movie classic?

This is a great date film, family night movie, and teaching documentary.  It goes into my ""Best of DVDs"" series.  It is recommended to all as the Best Film of 2010!",1299628800,3,2235,4.932975871313673

In fact, this movie blatantly copies Gladiator, Braveheart, and even Saving Private Ryan in one scene.  His character is basically interchangeable between Gladiator and this; so IE - he is not acting, simply ""being himself on camera"".  The part of his movie that were actually good are the scenery, sets, and costumes.  But the plot?  Or vacuous lack thereof?  Forget it.  Crowe plays a genuinely annoying/brash/arrogant version of Robin Hood, and I'd even argue that he acts nothing like any Robin Hood ever; not Errol Flynn nor Kevin Costner.

4194021,3,B003U0AHBO,"This Ridley Scott version of Robin Hood is well-made and entertaining, but considering the number of heavy hitters involved (Academy Award winners Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe, and Cate Blanchett), it's surprisingly lightweight.  I read some reviews by movie critics before watching the movie, and it wasn't nearly as bad as the reviewers made it out to be, but still not nearly as good as it could have been.  Russell Crowe is great in the movie.  But because he's so great, his scenes with Cate Blanchett are almost hilarious for that reason - by the end of two hours they're supposed to be in love, but they have zero chemistry between them.  Cate Blanchett plays the character of Marion as part-Nervous Nellie, part-ice queen, and expends little effort into developing her attraction to Robin.  The class struggle story is given added depth through a revelatory scene about Robin's origins - there is a serious statement about abuse of the lower classes that suggests that some deep thought went into developing the story, but the director (understandably) is focused for much of the movie on presenting the basic ""Robin Hood"" storyline such that the mystery of Robin's origins is given short shrift.  Max Von Sydow and Russell Crowe are terrific together in their revelatory scene.  And when the surpise is revealed, I wanted to know more about the surprise, rather than the familiar ""rob from the rich"" storyline that we've already seen in countless versions.  [About the surprise: Without giving it away, I'll just say that Robin's forgiveness toward his transgressor would make Jesus Christ proud.]  So there are elements in this movie that elevate it above the action-and-adventure genre.  For instance, the King John character in this movie is not just a stock evil king; he believes that his right to abuse the lower classes and to demand tribute from lesser nobles comes from God (the ""divine right of kings"").  But those original moments are too few, and overwhelmed by dialogue and scenes that only serve to move the plot toward the next battle scene.  At the end of the movie, I was impressed by the movie overall because it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting, but I wouldn't voluntarily choose to watch it again.  So my recommendation is this:  You should rent, not buy.",1299369600,2,2290,4.898963730569948
4194022,3,B003U0AHBO,"Robin Hood isn't necessarily a BAD movie by any means.  It's just that... you know, I must have seen this same type of theme a thousand times by now.  I'm pretty worn out with the whole concept.

You have your typical castle theme, you will soon witness a huge army of both good versus bad constantly fighting each other, you will then get to experience countless and tiresome scenes of deadly, flaming arrows shooting across the land killing people in dramatic play-like fashion, and the entire concept is just pretty boring and overdone by this point.

I think the thing that really irks me above everything else is that, despite the fact you're supposed to feel excitement over the constant battles taking place, you actually feel exhausted and cheated instead.  Exhausted because they never end, and cheated because they're never believable or vicious enough.

I'd really like Hollywood to try coming up with some more interesting and creative concepts in the future, because these type are really beginning to get on my nerves.  As far as Russell Crowe's performance, he was decent enough but he's still a pretty overrated actor if you ask me.

I don't know what else to say.  I've experienced so many action/adventure flicks over the years identical to Robin Hood that it's honestly becoming harder and harder to deal with them anymore.  At least that Prince of Persia movie was a little bit better storyline-wise mainly because the action scenes were spread out enough to actually notice and appreciate them whenever they occurred.

4194024,3,B003U0AHBO,"I had very high hopes for this movie.  The trailers were fantastic and I have always enjoyed the Robin Hood story be it in the Prince of Thieves, Disney, or Men in Tights versions.  Robin Hood is just an interesting character with a great persona and mission.

It seems that typically Robin has been portrayed as a pretty boy.  I think Russell Crowe did a great job blowing that aspect away.  I'm not trying to saying Crowe is as ugly as a mud fence, I'm just saying he appears to be more of a rough outdoors type.  He has more of a worn soldier look, which I think fits the character better, especially living in the woods and running from the law constantly (that just can't be good for your youthful look).

I also like that Scott took this film in the direction of a prequel.  It is so hard to come up with a back story to a character like Robin, especially someone that is suspected to have been a real person, but is not supported by any real concrete evidence.  Marion is referred to as Marion Loxley, and its very interesting to see her and Robin together as simple aquaintances rather than a romantic item.  It gives a little more depth to their relationship.  Cate Blanchett plays an awesome part as Marion by the way.  Another stand-out character was Mark Addy as Friar Tuck.  Tuck to me has always played an important part in Hood stories, just as much if not more so than Robin himself, and Addy just does such a good job with Tuck.  Such comic relief and memorable instances. Danny Houston, Oscar Isaac, Matthew Macfadyen, I'm just sorry but I don't think they spent very much time on your characters so I'm going to have to say, boring portrayals of King Richard, Prince John, and Nottingham Sheriff.  Kevin Durand was a great Little John and was actually well supported by Robin's other followers.  All together they made quite a funny group that I think really added to this movie.

Now for the parts I don't like (usually I do these first, but it just seems more fitting in this situation to do them last)

1- King Richard was killed off way too fast.  I would have liked to see more of Richard, or a possibility of a return.  As in the Disney Robin Hood where Richard returned at the end to overthrow Prince John, I think Richard should have been kept available for a comeback.  Such a good character and it seems a shame to get rid of him.  Potential for a future antagonist or protagonist, but not now.  Granted, it did work into the story, so at least it wasn't completely senseless.

2- The movie is just so...lacking.  There is just that element that would put it over that is missing.  It exists.  You don't want to say it wasn't a good movie but you really can't think of anything good to say about it either.  It just plays with you too much, there is so much potential and so much to keep your attention that you can't turn away.  Its not boring, but its not entertaining.  The only thing I really know to compare it to is a day of unsuccessful deer hunting.  You got to do something, the potential for something great to happen was there, but in the end what did you really walk away with?

3- Robin was noted in the movie as being an exceptional archer.  Not an extremely gifted archer, but exceptional.  However, he hardly ever shoots a bow!  In the big battle scene at the beach (climax of the movie) hes running around swinging a freaking sledge hammer! What sense did that make?  If I was the Craig Harrison of bow shooting, why not post up on a ridge?  Ride horse back through firing arrows but come on, a hammer?  *SLIGHT SPOILER* The best part of the whole movie was at the end, where the Sheriff of Nottingham is posting WANTED posters for Robin, he asks ""Where is a nail?"" and an arrow comes flying out of the woods and pins the poster to a tree and everyone starts laughing.  Some guy stands up in the theater I was in and yells ""Who the **** shot that?!""  I couldn't help but scream ""Robin Hood dumb @$$!"" and of course the whole theater starts laughing.  Come on, who shot the arrow?

All in all, its a good watch for a lazy Sunday.  Like I said, its not great but its not bad.  The good I see in this is, there are plenty of chances to expand.  The back story is out of the way and now we can make some real Robin Hood action go on.  Nice prequel but I just don't think this will stand alone as a movie.",1297900800,,4346,4.29679802955665

In fact, the idea that Robin Hood was more of a commoner goes back to the older legends of Robin Hood before the spin that he was the Earl of Huntington.  There's little about stealing from the rich to give to the poor and more of a focus on political intrigue with an emphasis on the rights of the English Lords that would lead later to the Magna Carta of 1215.  There are also more historical accuracies than inaccuracies which is rare for a Hollywood film.  Many of named characters really did exist during that era and for the most part a good or better job is done by the actors and actresses.  Cate Blanchett's character, Marion, seems more 21st century values than matching for those times but without giving spoilers I suspect she wanted in on some of the fun, especially at the very end.  The romance was done better than expected and there are some well executed scenes. FAIRLY ACCURATE HISTORICALLY: William Marshall did exist as an advisor and was closer to the Mother Queen than King John; the Baldwins and Fritzes did exist as powerful noble houses; armor was a pain to put on and off as shown in one scene; brutal warfare; filthy people; grain shortages and a bad economy; corn references (bread was called this name back in the day); untrained Marian going down fast at the end battle; PROBABLY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE: the furniture; the clothes; a Scottish bowman while not likely seems possible; the festivities of commoners (lively and fun to watch); old ruins and Green Man; The Charter of the Forest (not the Magna Carta as some people are calling it) was after the Magna Carta and during the reign of King Henry III, son of King John (we are only talking about a couple of years here as the Magna Carta was in 1215 and the Charter of the Forest was 1217; I heard mention of this but not Magna Carta; whatever the case they combined the two when one built upon the other and under another king); the balls of fire on the castle gate could have been Greek Fire but that's really stretching it; women riding into battle was incredibly rare but did exist; NOT ACCURATE HISTORICALLY: the French being driven off the coast (many English Barons invited them when they were unhappy with King John; the French King has a claim to the English throne by blood; the French were there for a long time and they met with no resistance upon landing); the manner of King Richard's death (he didn't within seconds; he was slain by a crossbowman and not a cook and he forgave the boy but after he died some angry mercenary had the boy killed); a bowman using a big sword and riding a horse and impersonating a noble (unlikely); CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; HISTORICAL ACCURACY FOR HOLLYWOOD: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: January 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus (B plus to A minus if you want a fun movie and don't care about historical accuracy).",1297728000,2,3011,4.525735294117647

The film presented 2 great actors at the top of their games: Crowe, Blanchette. The action came heavy and often.  The scenery was beautiful.

How could they mess this up?... Well, they did... It just didn't click.

I'm reluctant to criticize the length of a film.  I've watched many 3-hour movies and wished they were longer.  But, this film stretched a 90 minute story into 150 minutes.  It REALLY dragged.

There was zero chemistry between Robin and Marion.  Both actors seemed far more interested in posing than they did in each other.

Bit characters play a significant role in story.  I don't enjoy films that portray one-dimensional parts around the main stars.  Other than Robin and Marion, every character was a cardboard cutout.

While most Robin Hood media focus on his time in Sherwood Forest tormenting the Sheriff of Nottingham with his steal-from-the-rich antics, this movie actually tells the tale of how Robin Longstride, a common archer in the King's army, eventually became the outlaw known as Robin Hood. Disappointingly, they never really say how he managed to become such an incredible archer. He already seems to have mastered that art before the start of the movie. The screenplays & special effects of some of his shots are quite nice, however. I really enjoyed the way Ridley Scott worked hard to keep historical accuracy present in this movie while preserving key elements of the Robin Hood tale. As you progress through the historical elements of the story (Richard the Lionheart sacking castles & eventually dying; King John's greedy rule), Robin's personal story leads him to meet people like Little John, Friar Tuck, Marian, and several other familiar names. The movie was terrifically cast, gorgeously costumed and designed, and overall very enjoyable to watch.

4194034,5,B003U0AHBO,"Another Robin Hood movie?  Really?  Do we need one more retelling of the same story again?  Were these the thoughts that ran through your mind when you heard that there was going to be a new Robin Hood movie starring Russell Crowe?  We have grown up with Robin Hood and his Merry Men through movies like Disney's animated animal adaptation or Kevin Costner's attempt to sound English.  In most Robin Hood movies, Robin is a nobleman who, along with his Merry Men, became outlaws and spent their days robbing from the rich and giving to the poor and causing mischief for the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John.  Once the great King Richard returns from the crusade, he blesses the marriage of Robin and Maid Marian and there is peace throughout the land.  Could there really be a different way of retelling the same story yet again?  The answer is yes!  Ridley Scott, in his new adaptation, gives Robin Hood a fresh perspective while keeping the film historically accurate through the story, performance, and the production value.
In Ridley Scott's retelling of Robin Hood, Robin is a commoner pushed by circumstances into a role of leadership to be the voice of the people against the injustices forced upon them.  Robin is portrayed as an honest man who even told the King the truth when he did not want to hear it, but despite this honesty Robin takes the clothes of a dead nobleman and assumes his identity.  This Robin Hood is in a sense still the traditional antihero, but Ridley Scott gives a
better understanding and the reasons why he is this way.  This version of Robin does not rob from the rich to give to the poor just because it would be fun to mess with the Sheriff of Nottingham but rather he does it out of pure necessity due to the oppression caused by the crown.  The tag line of the film is ""Rise and Rise Again Until Lambs Become Lions.""  The meaning of this phrase is to never give up.  There is a strong theme of not giving up throughout the film that is represented through Robin's quest of identity and fulfillment. In this version King Richard is not the good king we're used to seeing, but rather a more cocky man, out for glory who is killed in the first ten minutes of the film.  Another difference is Maid Marian, she is in fact not a ""maid"" at all but a married woman.  Ridley Scott takes all that we know of these beloved characters and completely changes them by taking out the clich bits from the traditional folklore so that we are left with new story lines to explore.
There is a truthfulness in the performance of the actors in this film.  The serious and humorous interactions between Robin (Russell Crowe) and the Merry Men (Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes, and Alan Doyle) feel real and more believable than in so many previous productions.  The fact alone that Russell Crowe keeps a consistent accent through the whole movie unlike Kevin Costner makes it that much better.  The subtle and slightly unconventional nature of the romance between Robin and Marian (Cate Blanchett) brought a new twist to how their romance is typically portrayed.  There can be a tendency in movies to force a romance, and by doing so it can come across as fake and boring but in this film the romance is understated.  It's interesting to note that Alan Doyle of ""Great Big Sea"" plays Allan A'Dayle and can actually play the lute. This idea of a musician playing a musician is yet another fact that leads to believability.
Ridley Scott's eye for detail gives credence to the time period through the films art direction and production.  The choice of the locations that were used seemed to be untouched by modern society.  The architecture of the sets from the large castles to the small villages was nearly all constructed by hand.  There is an added depth to the film when the characters are surrounded by real, constructed items that are not just CGI images.  The choice of colors and the cuts of the silhouettes of the costumes give a look and feel of grittiness appropriate to the 12th century.  The cinematography and the artful editing during the action sequences add to the intensity of the drama in the film.  Another important aspect of the film is the score; there is a strong Celtic theme that was thoughtfully composed to keep in line with the time and location portrayed in the film.  Usually when the end credits start to role the movie is over and you go home but the end credits in this film are probably the most creative end credits in a film to date.  Even though the movie is over you can't help but stay and watch the artful animation depicting different scenes from throughout the movie.  It should be noted that this film is rated PG-13 and contains mild violence and some sexual content that may not be appropriate for younger audience members.  Also, some of the actions of Robin and his comrades may be seen as morally objectionable.  That being said, there are also things in this film that can be great learning devices in exploring the main themes and the film.
Robin Hood is a story that has been passed down from generation to generation over centuries.  Although Robin Hood has been told over and over again Ridley Scott brings a new perspective to the story that has not been done before.  This is perhaps the first time that Robin Hood has ever been portrayed in a historically accurate way.  There are some things in the
screenplay that may not have been historically proven but add to the affluence of the story.  The actor's performances and the film's production are what make this classic tale come to life.  One of the foremost reasons this movie can be recommended is because the main theme of not giving up and persevering through whatever obstacles may come your way is a theme that can be beneficial to all ages.",1296691200,,5772,4.6005859375

Russell Crowe delivers his usual mumbly performance, playing ""Robin Longstride as Russell Crowe"" and not as the posturing, overemotive Hood of previous renditions.

4194043,4,B003U0AHBO,"The oft-told tale of Robin Hood is brought to the big screen again, this time by Ridley Scott, director of ""Gladiator."" It is not surprising that Russell Crowe, star of the director's 2001 Oscar-winning film, plays the heroic ""outlaw"" of the new British/American adventure film. The 2010 ""Robin Hood"" is an action adventure film, but the action sequences, thrilling as they are, are not many in number in this 148-minute film, and those who are looking for a romance would be disappointed.

Set in 1199, ""Robin Hood"" follows the story of Robin Longstride, a skilled archer and swordsman. Robin Longstride, tired of the long war, flees the Crusading army with Alan A'Dale (Alan Doyle), Will Scarlett (Scott Grimes) and Little John (Kevin Durand) to secretly return to their homeland. On their way, Robin meets Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge), who was just attacked by plotting Godfrey (Mark Strong), and Robin promises the dying knight to return the sword to his father and its original owner Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow).

Ridley Scott's new tale on the famous legend starts with an intriguing premise, but loses its grip on narrative in the following mid-section. The storyline is too convoluted in the second half of the film, with a back story about Robin's childhood. The relationship between Robin and Marian (Cate Blanchett) is not interesting because of the lack of chemistry, and the low-key performances from the players. Action scenes are very good, but sometimes too many characters clutter the screen. The cast is great including Eileen Atkins, William Hurt and Mark Strong, but their characters tend to be rather flat.

All in all I enjoyed ""Robin Hood"" and his adventures though I think a simpler plotline would have allowed the film to showcase its strength more effectively. I also hope some loose ends (who are those children anyway?) will be tied up in the sequel if there will be one.",1295049600,,1906,4.968652037617555

4194056,3,B003U0AHBO,"I am huge Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett fan. These are immense talents. So, what went wrong? I suspect there must have been severe script issues from the beginning, unlike Gladiator, the obvious Scott/Crowe collaboration to compare Robin Hood to, which had a richly detailed story with well-conceived and fleshed out characters. There are sparks of Scott's greatness here. Few directors can put together these types of massive battle scences, whilst keeping them focused at a human level. There are also excellent scenes showing the chemistry between Robin and the men that are willing to follow him. I found the ""back-story"" of Robin's ""daddy issues"" pretentious and irrelevant. It adds nothing to the film, and it feels like a ""justification"" for Robin's actions, when one is not needed. Then we have Cate Blanchett's ""Marion"", who is mired in a mess of poorly written scenes. This is not Blanchett's ""fault"", as her performance itself is a highlight of the film; however, her substantial talents are almost totally wasted. Everything in the movie, to me, seems rushed and incoherent - especially in the ""Director's Cut"", which makes a movie that is far too long even longer, yet adds no substantive value. Robin Hood is not Blade Runner, and the ""Director's Cut"" lacks purpose and intensity. Robin Hood is not a terrible movie. You have, and will, see much worse films. However, it SHOULD have been a far better outing. If you are a huge Scott fan and are itching for a ""Historical Epic"", you would be better served with ""Kingdom of Heaven"", which is far from the greatness of Gladiator, however it is a much more coherent film than Robin Hood.

I went directly to the Directors Cut and found that version to be well made without the storytelling hiccups the theatrical version seemed to have from the other reviews.

Some minor critisms about this movie were that the third act seemed to be a little rushed and the movie came across a little more serious than it is perhaps intended to be.

4194059,5,B003U0AHBO,"Despite a convoluted and tortuous pre-production history and the participation of two of the more oafish bigheads in the business, Ridley and Russell's Robin Hood is a surprisingly impressive and enjoyable medieval epic that manages to find a new string for the old longbow by placing a prequel to the Hooded Man's outlaw days in a relatively accurately drawn Middle Ages with some contemporary relevance. Admittedly it's going to mean a lot more to British and European audiences, but it's hard not to notice that in its unloving royal siblings Richard (a gruff and bluff Danny Huston) and John (an impressive Oscar Isaac) there's more than a little Tony Blair - vain, bankrupting his abandoned country in unnecessary foreign wars and delusionally regarding himself as a pretty straight kind of guy yet quick to punish anyone who tells him the truth - and Gordon Brown - a petty and spiteful ruler who briefly wins over his people with promises he promptly drops as soon as his throne is secure and is woefully inadequate at turning the economy around. The film even uses the infamous political kiss-of-death phrase 'resigning to spend more time with his family' when honest chancellor William Marshall (William Hurt, looking surprisingly like the director) finds himself out of a job.

There are more nods to James Goldman than Errol Flynn here: Eleanor of Aquitaine gets a few bits of Lion in Winterish sniping without the barbed wit (though John's retort ""Spare me your farmyard memories, mother: they're not real and I don't understand them"" comes close) while the film begins, like Robin and Marion, with Robin and Little John in the King's bad books for being a bit too honest as the Lionheart loots his way back from the Crusades. There's an even stronger element of Martin Guerre to the tale as well as it finds a plausible explanation for Robin's twin origins as the peasant Robin Longstrides and the dispossessed noble Robin of Locksley, doing a neat job of tying in the origins of the Magna Carta and civil disobedience to the legend in the process.

There's plenty of action too, ending with not one but two big battles, though the grand finale is a bit too Saving Private Robin at times and Cate Blanchet's presence leading a small band of feral children in the climax seems a clumsy contrivance to put her in jeopardy merely so she can be rescued (she's far more convincingly placed heroically centre stage in a raid on her village). Throughout, the money's on the screen, with little apparent CGI - the sets, while not extravagant, have weight to them - and if it could use a few more extreme long shots at times, it makes good use of the British landscape for once. Thankfully Scott doesn't overdo the stylistics or the MTV editing here, settling for good old-fashioned storytelling and even throwing in that long-absent favorite, the burning map montage sequence. As for Crowe, while his accent briefly makes a detour to Newcastle before settling in Barnsley for an initially ill-advised UK chatshow host Michael Parkinson impersonation (so much so you almost expect him to say ""So, Richard - this Crusades business. Bit of a lark or is there a more serious side to it?""), but luckily he grows in stature alongside the character. And satisfyingly, this film is a real journey, not just from France to England but from opportunist to idealist to legend as Robin's progress mirrors that of the character's evolution from the thug of the early ballads to the champion of the oppressed of modern lore.

While it isn't as good or as ambitious as Kingdom of Heaven, this Robin Hood is still surprisingly damn good entertainment. The extended director's cut gives more time to the feral children and adds a brief action scene and a comic scene between Robin and Marion, but generally works as well as the theatrical cut - there are no huge structural changes or additional subplots here as there were in Kingdom of Heaven's director's cut. Decent but not overwhelming extras on the BluRay include 10 deleted scenes with introduction by editor Pietro Scalia, one-hour documentary Rise and Rise Again, 6 TV spots, teaser trailer and full theatrical trailer.",1293580800,,4166,4.88135593220339

In an age of pretty boys like Pitt, Damon, DiCaprio, etc., Russell Crowe seems to be a throwback to the age of real men like Wayne and Gable.  He is terrific.  He is matched by Cate Blanchett.  Terrific casting: She is attractive in a non-glamourous type of way.  She strikes me as looking as a midevil woman might look.  (Somehow I cannot see a Jennifer Anniston type in this role.)  They are matched with terrific supporting performance by William Hurt, Max Von Sydow, among others.  The sets and the action scenes are terrific.  There is a rousing battle scene at the end as King Philip of France launches a seaborne invasion of Britain, only to be repulsed by the Brits led by Robin Hood.  This scene reminds one of a mid-evil version of the D-Day landings in Darryl F. Zanuck's classic ""The Longest Day.""  Directed by Ridley Scott, this reminds one of their earlier triumph ""Gladiator.""  Crowe even mentions on the very good documentary on the making of this film that they were trying to emulate, even one-up, the previous film.
Other than the documentary, there are many very good deleted scenes with or without commentary by the film's editor.
In conclusion, this is an epic intelligent historical spectacular.  As stated, I enjoyed it even more this time.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray are excellent as well.",1293321600,3,1441,4.708
4194067,4,B003U0AHBO,"This is a good movie to watch if you enjoy history (reminded me of the way the show Tudors is done) and want to see some fantastic acting. Don't expect many chuckles until the middle. If you're looking for the actual robbing the rich story then you're out of luck as this is literally a movie about Robin's life BEFORE the forest.

Things I liked:
*Acting- From the children and extras to the A-list actors, all who had a role in this film were superb.
*History- It wasn't a movie where they just dressed the part and spoke with silly accents. It's obvious when watching that they tried to remain as faithful to history as they could in all areas of clothing, scenery, language, dates, etc.
*Tone- This wasn't a Disney portrayal. I half expected Robin to be lighthearted, mischievous, and arrogant running around stealing from the wealthy and living a grand life in the forest. This version had a dark and dreary tone which matched the mood and events of the time.
*Action- They made Robin and the other archers good at what they did while still being human (unlike the fancy tricks performed by Legolas in Lord of the Rings).

Things I did not like:
*Action- The version I watched was the director's cut so perhaps it was longer than the theatrical version? In any case the beach scene in the end was just too long. By the time all the soldiers were united you already knew they would outnumber and win over the french.

I decided to give this a chance because of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.  The two of them have been involved in more movies that I've found to me outstanding than I can think of right now.

From the start I was drawn into the story, and struck by the historical and political aspects of this film.  All the care and little details that went into making this film really made the viewer connect with it, in its historical context.

I had no idea what the Robin Hood story was really all about, but have a greater sense of that now, and have been reading up on 12th century English history as a result.

It's about time a film like this was made about Robin Hood, and the real story presented.

4194078,2,B003U0AHBO,"Some reviews here and elsewhere say 12th century.  The movie is based upon 1199 AD England, and some espionage and undermining deceit purveyed by a French band of spies.  Russell Crowe is an excellent actor.  Cate Blanchett is a fine actress.  But this story tries to spin off the traditionally loved and longed for story of Robin Hood, and tells a slightly outside-the-box version of how it all may have began.  The character of Robin is a common archer in the Crusades who practices hosting some goofy carnival style game when he's not fighting as a soldier; the pea and 3 walnut shell halves con game.  Fate and luck gives Robin an opportunity to become a knight by appearance, and wouldn't you know, it turns out he probably used to be one anyway.  Robin saves the day in a siege by France, and the King gets jealous of Robin's popularity and makes him an outlaw, banned from what he earned.
The most this movie has ever received for a rating is PG-13, and the director's cut is no different.  Could have been made sultrier really easy, or made far more FX gorier.  Either or both would have been a great help.  As it is, it comes across as plain dry white toast.  The cast was stellar enough.  The sets and costumes were epic and accurate enough.  But the movie tries too hard to stay family oriented; politically correct.  Let's have some good old cussing, some female nudity, and some skulls getting cleaved or just downright severed.  Or we can just prance around looking serious and tough, and never really do anything.  Kind of like a professional conference for knights of the Dark Ages, 12th/13th century England.  Meh.  Was this movie intended exclusively for the pre-teen?
The only thing this movie had that was really cool was the engraved words on a sword's hilt, ""rise and rise again"" on one side, and on the other side, ""until lambs become lions"" which was covered by a cord wound tightly around the handle.  It means never give up for the cause of liberty, never, ever give up. Rise, and rise again, until the docile lambs become conquering lions.
But as big of a deal as is made of the sword, it never goes anywhere in this film, and is the most disappointing and blatantly sequel oriented thing in celluloid I've seen for over a decade.  If this is going to be a series of movies, they need to say so up front.  Marketing strategies get tiresome when the fans are so unashamedly exploited, if there are already plans in the works for sequels.
I haven't spoiled the whole movie, go ahead and watch it.  But I predict you'll wish you waited to buy one used if you plan to own the DVD.  Unless you collect Robin Hood movies and have the Douglas Fairbanks version (1922), the Errol Flynn version (1938), the Sean Connery version (1976), the Kevin Costner version (1991), the Disney animated version where Robin Hood is a fox and Little John is a bear (1973), the Patrick Bergen version (1991), the Cary Elwes version (1993), or who knows how many others, then go ahead and buy this DVD too.  But if you're just a fan of Russell Crowe or Cate Blanchett, you might want to wait until you can buy your DVD here on Amazon as a used but in new or very good condition version.  Their roles in this version needed to go further.  Why America is going backwards in time with tighter restrictions upon censorship of entertainment, is hard to understand.  It isn't a high school documentary history lesson for crying out loud.  Let's go ahead and portray some genuine realism in how people talked and actually lived.  No wonder it didn't take in a king's ransom at the box office.  This 2010 version should have came out in the 1950's.  It would have fit better for how much restraint was exercised; and yet even from that perspective, I've seen more violence in a John Wayne Movie.  Don't tell me this Robin Hood movie was researched and accurate.  St. Louis, Missouri in 2010 AD must seem like a good place to raise a family and retire to the reviewers who say this movie is accurate for the time period.

Ridley Scott's version of Robinhood is clearly NOT meant to be a DISSERTATION on British history. The new-ish takes on the history surrounding the story of Robinhood were interesting and kept the story moving and emotional. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe. I was pleased to see glimpes of Maximus from Gladiator and Aubrey from Master and Commander as well.

As far as the casting, well anytime you have Cate Blanchett on the screen I'm happy and I've been a big fan of Max Von Sydow for years so that was a welcome addition. As for Russell Crowe, well I must admit I was disappointed in his performance. He seemed listless and uninvolved in his character. I got the impression that he didn't really want to play the part and was just going through the motions. Being the central focus of the story that definitely hurt the film immensely.

'Robin Hood' never came to life for me as it should have. I love the Robin Hood mythos, all the production necessities were present and the cast was solid. Yet there was something missing. It lacked that emotional hook that draws the viewer into the story and forms that bond between viewer and onscreen character.

Of the earlier versions I definitely rank them (In order of lead actor): Bergin, Costner, Flynn, and Disney.  The version starring Bergin has been my favorite for years, even though it never had a theatrical release (it was released on TV), since it would have been going head to head with Costner's version.  I liked its setting, costuming, storyline, acting, etc.

Now we have a new version of Robin Hood starring Crowe.  I went with rather mixed expectations, since it's a much-used tale, yet I very much enjoy Crowe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind/dp/B000FVQLQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator (Widescreen Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella-Man-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000ARTN3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella Man (Widescreen Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-and-Commander-The-Far-Side-of-the-World-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001HLVS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Edition)</a>, etc.).  And, on the other hand, we have had a good dose of action films lately, and I wondered how this show would stack up.  You know, films like Iron Man 1&2, Prince of Persia, Inception, Avatar, Sherlock Holmes, Angels and Demons, Star Trek, etc.

Imagine my surprise when I realized that I enjoyed Crowe's version of Robin Hood more than any of those other films, except maybe Star Trek!  I liked it so much that I did something I seldom do...I bought a copy of this DVD as soon as it was released.

I thought the original storyline was an especially innovative approach to this legend.  This version actually leaves off about when most Robin Hood stories begin.  It was interesting to see where this screenwriter suggested that Robin Hood came from, as well as Little John, Will Scarlett, Allan aDayle.  I also enjoyed seeing Max VonSydow in a fatherly rather than a sinister role.  Other cast members were also fantastic, e.g., Cate Blanchett, William Hurt, Mark Strong, et al.  And Ridley Scott pulled it all off without a hitch.

When I combined storyline, acting, sets, costumes, and so on, it was a sell!  As I mentioned earlier, I picked this up just a few days after the DVD release, and I've watched it at least four times since that time (Sept 2010).  That in itself is a testament to how impresed I've been.

So, all in all, this movie is different that all earlier Robin Hood offerings, but its just as good in my opinion as the version starring Patrick Bergin, and far outdistances the Costner version.

No Errol Flynn or even Kevin Costner here; this Robin Hood is dark (sometimes bleak in fact), always serious, and rarely fun. Having said that, it's still a good film and worth the time investment.

The story begins before the beginning, with 'Robin Longstride' fighting in Richard the Lionheart's army, and only towards the end of the film do we begin to recognize elements of the usual Robin Hood tale. Familiar characters appear (sometimes briefly), but the main story focuses on Robin's relationships with his men, and his future father-in-law (a superb Max Von Sydow). Cate Blanchett is Marian (the ""maid"" title has been dropped), her strength of character and earthiness a welcome change from 'Maid Marians' of past films.

Ridley Scott's last couple of epic films haven't found large audiences like 2000's 'Gladiator', but this film deserves a wider audience and shows that there are still directors interested in making thoughtful, intelligent large-scale films.

The use of surnames is bogus (they came in later than the time of this film). The weaponry is partly wrong. And the too-early death of one of the key historical characters AND the invasion of England with what look like World War 2-era landing craft (with the King of France watching offshore) are just factually wrong and totally stupid.

And what of the stone mason who was a genius and dreamed up the Magna Carta before there was one? And the nobility listened to him? Eh? It never happened, nor would it ever have happened for many reasons, including the feudal class system.

Particularly in the extended version which just makes more sense than the theatrical version.  I feel part of the movies disappointment first time round in theatres, was due to a measure of mis-marketing.  This is not a Robin Hood movie as such - this is a precursor, a prequel of sorts - an origin story that reimagines how such stories and myths could come about.  Gone are the men in tights, gone is the jaunty humour, no more the scenes of robbing the wealthy and paying back the poor as a set up for the character.  In is a historical context, a history which reaches far beyond Nottingham, and large battle scenes.  Indeed, the addition of a huge D-Day style battle at the climax feels rather too over the top, and as well photographed and executed as it is, feels like a betrayal of the build up rather than a necessary dramatic high to end the movie.
The movie starts with a myth busting moment - an accurate recreation of King Richard dying at the hands of the French (and a cook, at that..), which sets Robin Longstride (soon to become Robin of the Hood) off on a journey with a band of (not so merry) men, back home.  At first, they are out to save their own skin and maybe accrue some wealth to ensure their future- and gradually, involved in a more altruistic fight, to quell a French plot to ignite the Baron's War.  The history after Richard's death is somewhat muddled, and liberally draws on events which occurred over a longer period and shuffles them around to fit this new version of history.  So we get the Magna Carta introduced years before it came about, a French invasion which never happened - or at least, not in a massive battle like this, and the Baron's war happening much earlier than it did.  But putting that to the side, this is quite a compelling and imaginative story of the character, and has ambitious scope, worthy acting and as we expect from Scott, well shot throughout.  Where we are let down, is the tagged on `big battle scene' and the excised humour.  Even real life has more smiles than this joyless exercise.  The deleted scenes give some clue that perhaps more humour was originally intended.. but as Roger Ebert suggested, it does rather make you pine for the smiling and happy Errol Flynn to carry off the darker moments with a bit more pizzazz.  Special mention should go to Mark Strong as the treacherous Godfrey, and Oscar Isaac as Prince (and King) John.. they at least uphold the tradition of the villain being entertaining.
As for the extended version - yes, it's long.  Too long, perhaps - but its significantly better than the theatrical version.  Included now are scenes which flesh out the burgeoning relationship between Robin and Marion, particularly the scenes involving the orphans running ferile in the forest, to whom they both try and reach out.  The background to Robin Longstride remembering his past and its significance is also much clearer here, with the addition of just a few short moments.
All in all, what was *** in the theatre has become a **** movie in this version - but still lacks the resolution and soupcon of humour that would have made it *****.",1289606400,,3268,4.636048526863085

4194109,2,B003U0AHBO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  The new Russell Crowe 'Robin Hood' is actually a prequel. It tells the story of how the mythical outlaw became the great 'man of the people' BEFORE roaming around Sherwood Forest with his 'merry men'. Instead of being pitted against the Sheriff of Nottingham (who has a minor part here), Robin takes on Godfrey, a bald-headed bad guy and enforcer for King John who later betrays the homeland by allying himself with the French.

  'Robin Hood' begins nicely with a finely costumed and gritty battle scene in France. Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an expert archer in King Richard the Lionheart's army. The King has just returned from the Third Crusade in the Holy Land when he is felled by an arrow during battle. It would have been nice if the film's scenarists had King Richard only speaking French since he never spoke English and spent most of his adult life in Europe, far from his native England. Longstride decides to return to England after he assumes the identity of a dying Knight, Robin Loxley, who has just been ambushed by Godfrey and his men. Longtsride promises the dying Loxley that he'll return the family sword to his father back in Nottingham.

  Longstride returns Richard's crown to John and informs him of his death. John is promptly crowned the new King and is determined to tax the hell out of the Kingdom. In his view, Richard squandered the treasury by paying for all of intrigues on the Continent and his ill-considered campaign in the Holy Land. He reminds his mother during a bitter argument that at one point, England had to pay a ransom to save Richard after he had been kidnapped by the Duke of Austria in 1192.

  With Longstride's appearance at the Court, I found it perplexing that none of the noblemen recognized that he was an imposer. After Longstride returns to Nottingham and accepts Sir Walter Loxley's proposal to impersonate his now deceased son, even more improbable is that no one in the town seems to be able to connect the dots and figure out that Longstride is not who he says he is.

  The main problem with 'Robin Hood' is that Russell Crowe exudes little charm, playing the mischievous outlaw as a grim-faced action hero. As for his cohorts, Little John and Will Scarlett, they have little to do except get drunk and assist Robin and Friar Tuck as they steal grain, confiscated from the local population by Church authorities. This act wins Marion Loxley over to Robin after she initially is stunned when her father-in-law asks her to pretend that she's married to Longstride. Most of the forest scenes can be found in the Director's Cut which were wisely trimmed for the theatrical release. For those insist on watching the Director's Cut, you'll be treated to 1) Marion and a goat stuck in quicksand and both subsequently saved by Robin and 2) Marion saving Robin after he's kidnapped by local orphans dressed as forest-dwelling savages.

  'Robin Hood' fares no better with its antagonists. The screenwriters come up with nothing to distinguish Godfrey from any of the typical bad guys found in any of today's films, whether they're based on real or fictional characters. And The Sheriff of Nottingham is even less likable than Godfrey with his constant lecherous advances towards the widow Marion. Only John is a little more nuanced as he vacillates in trying to appease the rebellious Northern Barons.

  Finally, history takes a back seat to any kind of verisimilitude when the French invade England shortly after John's ascension to the throne. In reality, King Philip of France recaptured English-held territory in France and John promptly invaded that country. It was actually eighteen years later that France finally waged war in English territory. In addition, the signing of the Magna Carta and its disavowal by King John, also came years after as depicted here in this film.

  Despite the convoluted chronologies, there is nothing wrong in attempting to depict Robin Hood in the context of his times. Except for blatantly anachronistic scenes such as when the French disembark from their warships in the style of a D-day invasion, I found the attention to period detail to be impressive. Nonetheless, without any charm emanating from the principal character, a lack of chemistry between the romantic leads, antagonists who show little complexity and glacial pacing in spots, the new 'Robin Hood' is at best, a lackluster affair.",1289001600,7,4436,4.899732620320855
4194110,5,B003U0AHBO,"I am a very big fan of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.  This semi historical portrayal of Robin Hood is a great work. Many feel the violence is too much and I know that violence is a problem - however this is set in a very turbulent period in the history of England and it speaks at great lengths to which the characters chose to bring that turbulence to the screen.
Being in my 60's I have seen a lot of Robin Hood movies.  Many were really poor quality, some were average, a few were actually good.  This is by far the best one yet.
I highly recommend this as a real masterpiece.  Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchet are superb together.",1288915200,,635,4.223140495867769
4194111,4,B003U0AHBO,"This is one of the best renditions of the Robin Hood myth that I have seen in years.  What I particularly liked about it is that I am reading a medieval history at the moment, and amazingly, this fit right in with my current book (the wonderful Forge of Christendom, by Tom Holland) about when the castles were built, what the horrendous social upheavals were like, and the abuses of power.

The acting, starring with Crowe, is wonderful and subtle.  Blanchet is also brilliant as Maid Marion.  And the hilarious cameo of Max von Sydow, as the aristocrat who marries Marion off to Robin immediately after meeting him.  (""I woke up tumescent,"" he says. ""Imagine, at 80 years of age!""  Marion rolled her eyes.)  The bad guys are also convincing, though I didn't know any of them.

The plot is rather convoluted.  Robin is returning from the Crusades with Richard the Lion Hearted, who has become a simple, embittered plunderer on his way home.  In need of a quick passage, Robin and his cohort pose as knights, a capital offense in medieval reckoning.  This embroils them in a number of complications, taking them through Nottingham.  There, posing as aristocrats, they enter local politics, which eventually involves organized violence.  At the end, and we all know the myth so this is about reviewing the film and not a spoiler, they are denounced as outlaws.  So this is the start of a series, if the producers can finance it.

Recommended.  This is a good and solid version of the old story, or the first installment in a series.",1288915200,2,1531,4.6992481203007515

4194118,2,B003U0AHBO,"When I learned Russell Crowe would star in a new Robin Hood movie, I felt certain that at least it could not be as bad as the Kevin Costner rendition. Russell Crowe and Robin Hood surely would equal an intelligent and exciting film. But I was wrong. The problem begins with the screenplay, which apparently is another postmodern exercise in its boring faith in its perceptions to begin anew: it is an attempt to 'imagine' what kind of actual facts might have undergirded the growth of the legend. None of it, beyond the most obvious, is particularly plausible, and it does not add up to close to a satisfying whole. Its falsifying of history is much worse than anything in the Errol Flynn movie, because that clearly is meant to be just swashbuckling fun while this wants the audience to see it as saving people from the bad history of swashbucklers. If Russell Crowe is not ashamed of being in this movie, he is not as discerning as I thought him to be.",1288742400,5,954,4.520231213872832
4194119,3,B003U0AHBO,"I've always been a major Robin Hood fan. It all started with the quintessential Robin Hood film that I grew up with starring Errol Flynn. Swashbuckling at its best, this film was by far the best telling of the story of Robin Hood. Several others have done a good job as well. I even liked ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES even though many critics rapped on Kevin Costner for not adopting an English accent. In any event, I'm a Robin Hood fan.

Sorry to say but I'm not a big fan of the new release to DVD, ROBIN HOOD starring Russell Crowe in the title role. Its not that it's a bad film, it's just not the Robin Hood I'm used to. Perhaps it's not even the Robin Hood that most people are used to.

The film begins in the camp of King Richard where Robin Longstride (Crowe) is an archer in the King's army. On their return from the Crusades, the army is attacking castles on the way home. The King ventures out one night in search of one honest man, he gets and earful from Robin. While glad for his honesty, this leads to Robin and his friends being placed in the stocks during the next battle. A bad decision as during the battle the King is killed.

Now here is perhaps the biggest problem with this film. While many films seem in need of more story, this film has far too much. We're given scenes of Prince John, the heir to the throne behind Richard and his petulant child attitude towards life. We are shown the King of France plotting an invasion of England with traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong). We get court politics in the form of William Marshall (William Hurt) trying to do all he can to save England. And we eventually see a group of the King's men returning home with his crown led by Sir Robert Loxley only to be ambushed.

Thanks to the efforts of Robin and his men heading home on their own after learning of the King's death the crown is retained but at the cost of Sir Robert's life. Robin promises to return the crown to London and Sir Robert's sword to his father. Thus is set in motion an elaborate lie.

Robin returns and is greeted by Robert's wife Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robert's father Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow). Returning the sword, Sir Walter offers Robin a chance to better himself and help by posing as his son. Thus Marion would retain the land in the Loxley name and the lineage would continue.

While all of this is going on, Godfrey has convinced King John (now in place after receiving the news of his brother's death) that the crown needs more funds and must enforce the taxes people have been lax on. Given a command of his own, Godfrey has them killed by a team of French soldiers who are now under his command, plundering each town they go to in an effort to anger the Barons thus causing a civil war to break out.

Okay let's face it, Robin is the star of this movie and you know up front that he's going to save the day. Word of the uprising reaches Sir Walter and the arrival of Sir William also brings about the back history of Robin. But I won't spoil that for you. I also won't tell you what happens from here on out with the exception that by the end of the film you discover that all of this takes place and sets the stage for the legends of Robin Hood we've all grown up with; living in the forest, loving Marion, his merry men, etc.

If you can't tell from what I've told you already, there is tons of story involved in this telling of the tale of Robin Hood. So much so that at times between not being sure who is English and who is French and just who is siding with whom it gets a bit confusing. Some will have no problem following along here (fortunately I didn't but it felt time consuming) but others will wonder what in the world is going on.

The cast does a good job here but no one shines in any role. Crowe, who I think is a great actor, just seems to be going through the motions. Blanchett seems to be far too much of an independent woman for this to be taking place in the late 12th century. Only von Sydow comes off well as the blind patriarch trying to save his land and his country.

The golden age of the swashbuckler remains the classic telling of the tale. This film features much less action and only in about two scenes makes note of the famed skills with a bow and arrow possessed by Robin Hood. Don't misunderstand; it is a good movie, just not one that I'm likely to watch repeatedly. Instead I'll take down the classic with Errol Flynn, pop it into the DVD player and watch it again. It remains the standard that all Robin Hood films must be compared to.",1288742400,,4535,4.250580046403712

If you want to hear authentic music for the times, check out medieval.org for suggestions, or Music of the Crusades, the Newberry Consort, etc....

The music is actually my biggest beef.  Other than that, it's all Technicalities....

Crowe's voice sounds kind of....high?  Hoarse?  The soldiers on horses running up the hill looked extremely fake; they did in other scenes as well.  And I really don't like Cate Blanchett in the Marion part.  She's too old to play a fertile 30 yo type....sorry!  (I should know, I'm one of those, too...)

I think the direction and casting are excellent.  Loved Oscar Isaac as King John.  William Hurt is excellent in his part (Marshall) and it's good to see him back - especially in such a big movie.

4194133,4,B003U0AHBO,"If you are like me and grew up watching a myriad of Robin Hood shows, I can guarantee that this one is definately different. Traditional Robin Hood shows and movies usually reserve King Richard the Lionheart as the one to eventually return and restore justice to Robin Hood and his band of merry men. In this movie in an opening battle in France, King Richard is quickly dispensed with. Reminds me of the way that the old Roman King the movie Gladiator was killed off. In a similar fashion Russell Crowe's character eventually becomes a victim of a new self-centered young king.

Also, don't look for a band of men running around in the forest robbing the rich, Robin Longstride is only declared to be an outlaw in the closing 5-10 minutes of the film. But this sets the stage for a sequel quite nicely.

What the viewers instead are treated to are two large scale fight scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end. And as you may now know, Mr. Scott is quite good at presenting these types to fighting sequences. In between, the viewers get an insight into the life, politics and times in the 12th century, which seem to be accurately portrayed.

Apart from Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett (Marion) a stellar performance is given by Mark Strong(Godfrey) the bad guy in the last Sherlock Holmes movie. His screen presence comes across like 'Darth Maul' all be it without the make-up.

The movie starts with a bang and ends with an even bigger bang, in between it slows a bit on the action, but builds on the storyline, overall it is quite enjoyable.",1288051200,,1554,4.559139784946237

A Blu-Ray with Director's Cut and Theatrical Release, a standard DVD and the digital copy DVD. I had to sort it out to see which one to play on the blu-ray.  The most obvious DVD with the black coating and iron cross was the regular DVD.  The Blu-ray disc was not that obvious and had to read the small letters on the disc.  Blu-ray previews were taken from the internet so I prepared dinner while all that was going on until it came to the ""Play"" option.  The rest is interesting.  Movie appears to be the first half of a continuing story.  Some scenes reminded me of Gladiator; Crowe charging on a horse swinging a word and filleting the enemy, arrows flying everywhere, and Crowe walking through wheat fields with his hands open along the tops of the wheat.  Some were very short scenes but the parallels were there.  Good action flic with main characters and storyline intact for a continuation.

4194145,2,B003U0AHBO,"The film was ok, but I was mainly disappointed in the quality of the Blu-Ray. I watched the Directors Cut and the quality of the HD was inconsistent. In the same scene you can see the crisp and clear HD and then a very grainy shot is edited into it. It bugged me enough that it distracted me from enjoying the film.

*** SOME SPOILERS BELOW ***
As for the movie itself it fell short of my expectations and frankly I expected more of this incredibly talented cast and director. So you know where I'm coming from I really liked ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (for all of its historical flaws the character development is really nicely done and I found the story compelling) and I think Crowe and Scott make a great team. ""Robin Hood"" had a lot of potential but fell short of being really good. The characters were dangerously close to become caricatures of themselves and the last battle scene had me laughing out loud instead of on the edge of my seat. Lady Marian dressing up in armor and riding out with a cavalry of prepubescent boys charging into battle on Shetland Pony's was hysterically funny. I don't think that was the effect that Scott intended it to have but it broke up the tension and it was no longer dramatic. There were other things like Robin's father was a stone mason that was also a political visionary that came up with the ideas behind the Magna Carta that really didn't add anything to Robins character. Scott may have been trying to explain Robins anti-authoritarianism but it really didn't work for me.

Prior to viewing the film I expected to see ""Gladiator"" set in Medieval England -- with Russell Crowe playing Russell Crowe. I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are stunning  and I found the acting to be very good. I was particularly pleased with the portrayals of Queen Eleanor and William Marshal -- historical persons placed in an appropriate context. This latest screen version of the Robin Hood tale depicts a time period later than most of the films that preceded it. I was impressed with the manner in which the historical record has been maintained while allowing the fictional characters to be involved in the events portrayed. This is an excellent addition to the Robin Hood canon and should be viewed by anyone who enjoys the Medieval period. I look forward to the sequel.",1287705600,,845,4.827586206896552

The reference to the Barons Dispute did lead to war and then the signing of the Magna Cartr. Will the sequel focus on the heavy taxation of John to support his war? This will be central theme for ""Robin Hood Part II"" plus the First Baron's War and the loss of all land holdings of Normandy. Who will pardon and 'restore' Robin?

We both agree that it is the best film treatment of Robin Hood we have seen.  From casting, to cinematography, score, acting performances, script...even the titles, Ridley Scott's version was exciting, riveting, and had a nice sense of humor at times.  We liked it so much that it will be added to our DVD library, alongside the classic Errol Flynn version.  We also liked Sherlock Holmes and Nine, two other films that critics ripped apart.  We've concluded that critics don't like modern filmmakers messing with their preconceived images of what the movie should be.

4194151,3,B003U0AHBO,"Russell Crowe stars as the titular vigilante hero in Ridley Scott's take on Robin Hood, which for all intents and purposes isn't bad one bit, but isn't anything special either, and if anything comes off as being a 12th century Gladiator.  Instead of being the typical Robin Hood story, Scott's take on Robin Hood is an origin story of sorts, as soldier Robin Longstride (Crowe) returns home after his time in the crusades under King Richard (Danny Huston), and pulls a bit of identity theft as he is weaved into a Nottingham family (Cate Blanchett is the widow Marion, and Max Von Sydow her blind father-in-law) and begins to oppose King John (Oscar Isaacs), but not before a plot by the French to usurp the throne rears its head.  One thing I do like about this new take on Robin Hood is that it isn't the same old story of Robin fighting the Sheriff and stealing from the rich to give to the poor, but instead the film attempts to tie itself into actual history, in this case being the Magna Carta.  However, while visually impressive, the film still feels somewhat shallow in its storytelling and overall delivery.  By the time the credits start rolling and it becomes painfully obvious that more Robin Hood adventures could be well on the way, the final feeling that the viewer is left with is the equivalent of being ""okay...is that it?"".  Still though, Robin Hood isn't bad, and is worth seeing for Ridley Scott fans who enjoy the director's unique visual flair, but other than that, there isn't really much here to recommend.",1287446400,3,1532,4.659259259259259

It seems he spent most of the movie with his eyes on the ground.  There was no brilliant or amazing action or dialogue.  Too ho-hum, for me, and predictable.  The one time the Merry Men get to rob someone, it is so dark, it's hard to tell what is happening.  The really good movies, like ""Master and Commander"" you want to pull out and watch again and again.  I have seen this take on Robin Hood once and it is enough.",1287360000,6,569,4.261682242990654

If you watch the description of the movie by Russell Crowe you will find out EXACTLY what it is about.  It is a movie about man's inhumanity towards his fellow man as well as a GREAT love story.  Blanchett & Crowe are superb.

Kevin Costners' Robin Hood was okay, but this presentation is stunning.  From authentic looking sets to period dramatic flairs, this one has you hooked.  Russell Crowe is Loxley, aka Robin Hood pre-Prince John, and while other versions deal with Robin after his outlaw years, this is a prequel.  For that reason, it is able to touch new ground and break any pre-conceptions.  It succeeds.

We have Robin, Maid Marian, Little John, Prince John (pre-tyrant), and Friar Tuck.  Each of the characters gets their chance to breathe, and develop.  For instance, while we think Prince John is going to go along with the treaty he helped establish, he rejects it and sets up Robin to be an outlaw...we know the rest of the story from there.  It is entirely possible this sets up a sequel, at this point, we are not sure.

Cast chemistry, set dressing, location scouting, and stunt choreography/set up is top notch.  Where Rome and Spartacus set standards for TV accuracy, this Robin Hood sets the bar high.

4194167,5,B003U0AHBO,"I thought this movie was a great prequel to the Robin Hood saga. Since there is no actual proof that Robin Hood was real, the story itself can have a bit of flexibility.

I would have liked to have seen more new scenes added in this director's cut, especially between Robin and Marian. But still, a great movie.  The scenery was beautiful and the life of the people seemed very realistic.

My only complaint is that on my blu-ray player, if I hit pause, when I come back I have to start the movie over (search for the scene). My son also bought it and he had a similar experience. The dvd played fine, so I guess I'll just watch that unless I can set a couple of hours aside with no interruptions. Ha! Did anyone else have this problem?",1287187200,,833,4.2993630573248405
4194168,2,B003U0AHBO,"Positives:
Surprisingly accurate sets and props, at least at the start. Also some historic accuracy such as the seldom talked about Christian Crusades war crimes against non-combatant Muslim citizens.  Overall a nice view of 12th century life, Crusades and the interplay between what is now England and France.
Acting was decent and for the ladies the mandatory shot of Crowe - shirtless.
Directing showed great attention to detail which helps to envelope the audience into a most distant time. Much better than Disney's ""Prince of Persia"" which simply transports you to a Disney lot.

Negatives:
Movie started out strong with a good script, acting, pace and emotion but towards the end it seems as if the director and writers were running out of time, money and energy and simply wanted to finish quickly e.g. a lot of disjointed editing culminating in boringly extended cartoon credits.
The story, scenes and props also seemed rushed, contrived  and artificial such as the Hollywood war scenes e.g. the use of WWII landing craft being rowing without sails across the Channel or the massive arrow onslaughts with a ""Red Cliffs"" ripoff feel.

4194172,4,B003U0AHBO,"I'm telling you now, if you haven't seen this film then don't judge it.  So many people I know were all ""not another Robin Hood movie"" and ""we don't need to see this"" and ""looks like the same `ol same"" but I'm telling you, you will be pleasantly surprised.  This movie has serious bite and really works within its genre, and while it has flaws and fails to be perfection it does walk a thin line and really edges itself out in the end, producing something memorable, exciting and entertaining.

It does the legend justice.

Telling the story of Robin Hood from a more realistic and gritty perspective, Ridley Scott's epic retelling doesn't really feel much like the Robin Hood we are all familiar with.  Opening with a grandiose battle scene where King Richard The Lionheart is fatally wounded, the film follows one of his men, Robin Longstride, as he takes on the persona of a fallen warrior (one with a better reputation) and winds up fitting neatly into the mans life.  In an attempt to restore the departed man's belongings back to his family, he finds that the man's father (now blind and near death) is more than willing to go along with the charade, accepting Robin as his son and even persuading his daughter-in-law, Marion, to accept him as well (begrudgingly, of course).  When their small village of Nottingham becomes the target of some unwarranted aggression, Robin flexes his warrior muscle and begins to (attempt to) restore some much needed peace to the people.

Add a dash of political betrayals and believably mature sexual tension and you have a remarkable well rounded film for adults and teenagers alike.

Russell Crowe has a knack for playing these kind of warm hearted heroes.  He's done it many times before (`Gladiator', `Cinderella Man', `Master and Commander') and it never grows old with me.  He understands the dynamics of this man and portrays him effortlessly.

For those who saw the trailer and assumed that this was `Gladiator' redux, understand that you are mistaken and watch the film already.  This is not just a remake of a similar styled film but a whole entity all its own.

The directorial efforts here are outstanding.  For those who love them some swords and sandals type epics, Scott knows how to piece these together the right way, and it shows.  The battle scenes here are phenomenally structured and feel intense, raw and brutal despite the shielded PG-13 rating.  The cinematography is equally impressive.  The way that these actors and set pieces are framed is intoxicating to watch.  The acting is also a treat.  Crowe and Blanchett are two of the best actors working today (we all know I worship the ground that Crowe acts on) and they show their strengths carrying this film.  I loved the subtle yet forceful upheaval that Blanchett does on Marion, creating a very different character than one we are used to.  The cast is rather expansive and quite stunning when you think about it.  Besides Crowe and Blanchett you have Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Eileen Atkins, Danny Huston and fresh faces like Matthew Macfadyen, Oscar Isaac and Mark Strong (not to mention Mark Addy, who I kind of adore).  Everyone (for the most part) soaks up their assignment and delivers top notch.

Seriously, the one issue I do have with the film is that there are awkward moments (especially in the beginning) where it was clear that Scott wasn't sure what direction he wanted to go, thematically, with the film.  When he tries too hard to pay homage to the original interpretations he comes off a tad clunky and unrealistic (some of the dialog spilled in the films outset was unintentionally humorous and took you out of the film instead of placing you in it) but when he allowed his personal vision to take precedent the film soared.  It may seem like a small quibble, but it was popped up enough in parts to take this film down a peg for me (thus the B+ grade as apposed to an A).

All in all though, this film is a MUST SEE.  It is far from your typical (forgettable) summer movie blockbuster.  This action flick has guts and a richness about it that makes it above average!",1286755200,4,4109,4.698324022346369
4194173,2,B003U0AHBO,"This is a good story.  And it's a good movie.

But it has nothing to do with Robin Hood.  They use the names, they use the places; but they don't care about history, people or events.  If you care about the Robin Hood stories, this will not be a good idea to buy.",1286668800,,263,3.9056603773584904
4194174,5,B003U0AHBO,"Having already seen the Robin Hood film in the theater, I will be mostly reviewing the special features of the DVD.  For on thing, it includes the unrated directors cut version of the movie.  This was actually better, only slightly longer, with perhaps tow scenes slipped in that help clarify a few things and further the relationship between Marion and Robin Hood.  The special features have their own disk, and almost warrant a separate viewing experience because of how long they are.  There is a three part making of the movie section, along with the expected movie trailers and deleted scenes.

I found the making of Robin Hood to be quite fascinating, if a bit on the long side.  There was an astonishing amount of work and research put into creating the scenes and objects of that time period.  Just the fact that they actually filmed on location in some of the historic areas of England was impressive, and enough to make getting permission difficult.  It was also nice to know that there actually were hordes of extras on the set for battle scenes, rather than digital repetition.  Learning about details like these that went into the film made it that much more impressive.

Personally, I can't imagine anyone wanting to buy this movie without the special features.  Of course, I also can't imagine anyone not wanting to buy this movie, either.  It is one of those instant classics in the genre of heroic big action movies, where every viewing only reveals more about the movie to love.  For those worried that this Robin Hood is somehow a departure from the original myth, do remember that an English longbow of the time usually had a draw weight of over a hundred pounds, if nothing else, Robin Hood was probably even more muscular than Russell Crowe.",1286668800,5,1763,4.740983606557377

4194177,3,B003U0AHBO,"The main risk this movie takes is to portray the ""making"" of the man who could split arrows rather than retelling the memorable legend of old.  Though historians dispute whether Robin Hood exists or not, the aim of the film was to deliver a more realistic look at what the man may have been like.  Did this effort end up scoring Ridley Scott a bullseye?  I'd call it close but no cigar.

While the above paragraph gives the impression that this is a biographical narrative, this film is far from this.  The movie is riddled with heavy action and war sequences.  Much of the plot is moved by fighting as opposed to storytelling.  Though this may not differ from films with similar formulas there are some stark differences.  Take for example another Russel Crowe film Gladiator.  Much of the magic of the movie is ""the sands of the Coliseum.""  The difference between Gladiator and this film however, is that the battles that take place in the Coliseum do not dwarf the narrative itself.

Despite the story's tedium, the actors help keep the film together and make it an enjoyable viewing experience.  Crowe has a sort of scruffy charm that can make him pull off a slew of characters. His portrayal of Robin is slightly more towards the grizzly side but gives the hero an air of fortitude and strength.  Blanchett's Maid Marian is also delightful to watch and is full of wit.  She's certainly no damsel in distress and can definitely take care of herself without the help of a knight in shining armor.  Even Isaac's Prince John is worthy of mention due to his great portrait of a man full of delusions of grandeur and self-righteous importance.  It is Robin's band of merry men though that the good performances end sadly.

Ultimately, this version of Robin Hood lies on the edge of an arrow between good and poor.  If the script had gotten a few more treatments, and a couple dabs of the old legend thrown into the mix, it would have been immensely better.  Perhaps if it leaned more toward Sherwood Forest and less toward English nationalism.  I truly hope in the future, movies will follow such a formula in telling the story of this iconic character of literature.  Unfortunately, its hard to say whether the public would even be interested in another Robin Hood after having stomached countless retellings to date.",1286496000,14,2317,4.685643564356436

4194183,4,B003U0AHBO,"While not a perfect film, Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is superior to most of the adventure and action films produced today, and is vastly better than the critics would have you think.  Your feelings about Russell Crowe's personal life aside, he makes a fine, if somewhat mumbly, Robin Hood, and Kate Blanchet is, as usual, marvelous as Lady Marion.  The rest of the cast is also good, so that at the core, you have engaging and interesting characters, something in short supply with modern movies.

While taking a few liberties with Medieval history, the director nonetheless is faithful to the spirit of the times and the early proletarian versions of the Robin Hood legends.  At the same time, however, he weaves in enough of the Errol Flynn elements to satisfy fans of the romanticized Robin, all the while telling a rather new and different story than in previous incarnations.

The pacing of this film is somewhat slower the ADHD hyperkinetic tempo of most `action' films currently in release, but IMO this is a good thing, as such films tend to be little more than non-interactive video games.  Rather, what some incorrectly criticize as dull pacing is what used to be called plot and character development.  Rest assured, there are plenty of fun, exciting, and suitably bloody, fight and action scenes, especially ones with medieval armies and horses.

One failing is a bit of interesting but somewhat cryptic back-story inserted in Our Hero's life.  The back-story is not the problem, but it is fit into the story in a rather awkward fashion...something that could have been fixed with a bit more time in the editing room.

While this film is fun and thrilling, it is also exciting to contemplate as political allegory.  For this is the story of a nation led to ruin by the excesses and folly of the Ruling Class, bent on foreign military conquest, committing atrocities against Muslim civilians, and geometrically increasing its own wealth at the expense of the workers and the poor.  Within this setting, the focus is on Working Class heroes.  Featured within this tapestry is a handsome and intelligent political leader who initially feeds the hopes of the proletariat, but then sells them out as soon his need for their support passes.  Just as 1938 saw a Robin Hood for the Depression Era, the 2010 Robin Hood is clearly meant to evoke the circumstances of our own times.",1286150400,2,2382,4.8638613861386135
4194184,2,B003U0AHBO,"In terms of scope and detail this movie is second to none. And I generally enjoy this genre of films, which includes classics like BRAVEHEART, ROB ROY, and THE LAST SAMURAI. Having successfully cloned SPARTACUS with GLADIATOR, Director Ridley Scott asks Russell Crowe to clone BRAVEHEART. It's not a very successful procedure, though Crowe's performance doesn't disappoint. He's an excellent Robin Hood. If there had been an excellent script, this would have been a memorable film.

A kind of prequel without an original, ROBIN HOOD tells us the story of Robin Longstride, a common soldier in the army of Richard The Lionheart. Returning from the Holy Land after ten years of bloody crusading, the English army is raping and pillaging its way across the French countryside when Richard is killed in a skirmish. In the ensuing chaos, Robin assumes the identity of a dead English nobleman, Baron Locksley, and brings Richard's crown to the tightfisted miscreant King John.

Disappointed of a reward, Robin decides that he's for the noble life anyhow, and travels to the Locksley Estates, where he is quite impossibly allowed to take up Locksley's identity, with Locksley's wife Marian (Cate Blanchett) as an added bonus.

In the meantime, King John is overtaxing the barons, who want him to sign the Magna Carta. The barons decide to revolt. At the same time, the French decide to invade England to do a little despoiling of their own. A civil war breaks out, quickly followed by a French invasion. Robin Hood is the great unifier of men.

It all sounds good, but it doesn't work very well for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, this film isn't about Robin Hood. It's about a man who eventually becomes Robin Hood (the closing sequence of Robin fleeing to the forest ends with the splash, ""The Legend Begins"").

The film fails to spark the emotions, because the story never makes a connection with the viewer. This is a film about nobles fighting nobles. Robin Hood should be the defender of the common man, stealing from the rich to give to the poor, but the common man hardly makes an appearance, except in backdrop, while villages are being burned, for instance. Other than that, Robin the supposed nobleman is fighting for the landowners.

Even Robin Hood's grand speech about ""Freedom and Justice Under Law"" is delivered to the barons who are angry at King John rather than to the commoners who do their fighting for them.

The action sequences are gripping, though we've seen archers and cavalry and catapults and castles being stormed in BRAVEHEART and other films. The French invasion (complete with LSTs) is a sort of D-Day in reverse, and while its a well-crafted battle scene, I found myself not much caring who won the day.

ROBIN HOOD lacks humor. There's no wit or repartee between the characters. That would seem to be an integral part of the Robin Hood legend.

There's no swashbuckling romance. These Middle Ages are dreary. ROBIN HOOD has no knights in shining armor (just dirty clothes), no damsels in distress (Maid Marian swings a sword), no glittering banquets (rats scurry among the dinner dishes), and no sense of adventure (just a bloody, violent and terrible war). Considering that the Robin Hood tale is a legend, the producers could have had some fun with the story. It didn't have to be ""realistic."" All in all, Errol Flynn did it better.

Crowe is dynamic as Robin Hood, and Max Von Sydow is excellent as old Baron Locksley, but Mark Strong is too predictable as the Franco-English villain. Cate Blanchett does her usual impersonation of a bloodless corpse as Marian.

In sum, it all fails to inspire, and inspiration is the coin of the realm in this genre. We're being shortchanged.",1286064000,3,3718,4.8655063291139244
4194185,3,B003U0AHBO,"I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, and this genre in most instances. When this movie came out, I knew I had to watch it! To my dissappointment, the movie felt as though it dragged on and on without a singular purpose. Other reviews have mentioned it and I completely agree that it is boring, not purely for the lack of action, but also for the lack of character development and a clear vision.",1286064000,2,405,4.342105263157895
4194186,2,B003U0AHBO,"One fears that Ridley Scott is by now so important to the Hollywood money men that the prospect of someone sitting him down and offering advice would be seen as an act of outright hostility. And yet after watching ""Robin Hood 2010"" you feel that if only someone had the gumption to go up to him and say ""Look Rid, you are a great film-maker, you have a huge track record of success but frankly this is a pile of pants and that bloke Crowe's acting is as wooden as the outside privy door"" then something could have been salvaged from this risible mess. Indeed watching the Orange Commercial ads before the film you feel that Scott may have been one of the hapless directors whose film pitch was victim to the dastardly plans of the shallow, product placement executives who decided what they wanted was a mix of ""Robin Hood - Men in tights"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan""! It is true that Robin Hood films traditionally have a license to totally rip up the history book but in this case it was absolutely shredded thus we have a number of interesting new theories and historical discoveries. They include -

1. Robin Hood's dad wrote the Magna Carta (we now eagerly await in the UK the theory of Jesse James authorship of the Declaration of Independence!)
2. At the tail end of 12th century we were subject to a ""French Armada"" who alighted at the English equivalent of Omaha beach in World War II landing craft with oars and then decided that were anyone to make a film of their exploits they would make a pitch for Steven Spielberg to direct.
3. The Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire seems to have taken on whole new forms and dimensions in Scott's film where it is a veritable ""Champion the wonder horse"" carved onto a small hill
4. The English army may have been made up of a range of bowmen from Wales, Scotland, England and Ireland yet their accents were drawn from a hybrid mix of Geordie, Liverpudlian and down-town Brisbane dialects which they had a remarkable ability to interchange at any point.
5. It appears that someone had invented the tractor in the 12th century since there were clearly visible tyre tracks in the land in one part of the film
6. Peasants in 12th century Nottingham seemed to have a liking for music by the 21st century Irish musicians the Chieftains whose ""Women of Ireland"" sound-tracked a dance between Crowe and Cate Blanchett that had all the sexual chemistry of two penguins skidding on the ice.

Throughout the whole film the most sterling acting performances are given by the trees in Sherwood forest. Thankfully Scott found no place to introduce Morris men but every other cliche is thrown in not least the never ending scenes of fat friars drinking mead, buxom wenches cavorting or actors singing terrible folk songs. Cate Blanchett acts with all the verve of a women suspicious that her real life husband may be having her watched by a private detective and as a result is determined to do nothing of consequence to upset him. The film's villain British actor Mark Strong oozes about as much evil as a Sunday afternoon church village fete, what poor William Hurt is doing in here is anybody's guess and don't get me started on the bearded imp who played King John. It is Crowe however who gives them all a master-class in bad acting. It is a performance so destined for a Golden Raspberry award that if I were William Hill I would stop taking bets immediately. Indeed if it came down to a choice of Crowe or the cartoon Fox who played Robin Hood in the 1973 Disney classic a fair case can be made that our furry friend manages with ease to outshine portly Mr Crowe in every room of the acting department!

Clearly Scott's thinking on all this was with all the movie's pyrotechnics that we might not notice the wafer thin storyline and to be fair if he had sewn together the battle scenes and played down the clichd dialogue (""cometh the hour cometh the man"" - OH PLEASE!) he might have got away with it. Sadly at some two and a half hours plus this film is a tedious and bewildering slog and makes Scott's previous lowpoint ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" look like a Fellini. By the end of the a film we were threatened with a sequel (no Ridley no, we beseech you!) at which point I was so fed up the temptation to get up and shout ""Vive la France"" and sing the Marseilles was almost irresistible.",1286064000,23,4333,4.5171974522293
4194187,5,B003U0AHBO,"One of the best films I have seen in ages, one that only improves on further viewings, and it is a poor reflection of mainstream reviewers that they did not embrace the innovative approach to telling Robin's story before all the aspects associated with the legend began.  Indeed, this is the first time I have written an Amazon review because I liked this film so much: it combines a great action story with unerring recreation of 12th century England and France, the extraodinary acting skills of Max von Sydow and Cate Blanchett as well as an excellent Russel Crowe, a touching romance between Robin and Marion, enough fighting to appease any Iron Man fan, and how many action films that our kids see give them an understanding of the Magna Carta and the basics of modern economics?",1286064000,,784,4.7226277372262775
4194188,3,B003U0AHBO,"This film gave an amazing and beautiful impression of 12th century England. The art direction and cinematography could not be better. Life in these times was rough and even the King of England lived in conditions that were very primitive by today's standards. Therefore the attention to detail in architecture, clothing, furniture, and landscaping was a treat. This film has also received a good deal of criticism for historic inaccuracies. However we have to remember that the story of Robin Hood is fiction and thus has been fair game for novelists, cartoonists, comic book writers, and film-makers. Therefore the best advice I can give you is to enjoy the storyline, enjoy the acting, enjoy the action, enjoy the 12th century world created on the screen and don't worry if this version does not match the other versions of Robin Hood. Likewise, don't worry if the historic characters do and say things that are not historic fact, just enjoy the film as entertainment.  Most all of the versions include some aspect of the conflict between Richard the Lionheart and his younger brother John.  Robin Hood usually plays some role in support of Richard and in defiance of John. Also, the Crusades will play a role in a Robin Hood story for it is the absence of Richard during the Crusades to the Holy Lands that sets the plot for the conflict between the brothers. In this version, King Richard, played by Danny Huston, is returning from the Crusades and is storming the Castle Chaulus Chabral in Normandy. Russell Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an archer, who has served Richard during the Crusade, is present at this siege where Richard is mortally wounded. Robin and his comrades become involved in a struggle when Sir Robert Loxley, taking the crown back to England, is ambushed by the villain Godfrey, a double agent working for the French King while claiming to be Prince John's best friend. The siege of Castle Chaulus Chabral offers some stunning scenes but the back and forth dealing and double dealing as the physical crown is in jeopardy. Loxley is killed and Robin promises to return the crown as well as return Loxley's sword to his aged father. The character Godfrey, played by Mark Strong, may refer to the middle brother, between Richard and John that did double cross his brothers with the King of France in the film The Lion in Winter. However in this version Godfrey is not a Prince. Mark Strong has recently played some great bad-guys. He plays the nemesis of Young Victoria and the downfall of Tristan and Isolde, two great films for English history fans. Robin takes the crown back and gives it to Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine who then crowns her son John as King of England. Eileen Atkins plays Queen Eleanor as the all suffering mother who uses strategy to keep the ship of state afloat. Atkins plays this hard and wise old lady role well and she was fantastic in the film Vanity Fair. Robin then goes to Nottingham to return the sword to the aged Sir Walter Loxley, played by Max von Sydow. Max von Sydow is an institution and legendary actor who plays this role to perfection. To preserve the estate for Lady Marion Loxley, Robin must pretend to be her husband returned from ten years in the Holy Lands. Cate Blanchett plays this role perfectly.  Blanchett's performance will remind you of the wonder performances of Katherine Hepburn, full of power and grace. There is another sub-plot around the Magna Carta and the rights of men in England and the role Robin's father played in developing these concepts and the role Robin now plays in executing them with the current King John. King John was played by Oscar Isaac. King John is not a sympathetic character in most films.  In this film he is also a double crossing fellow but he is a handsome young vital man rather than an old strategist.  John Hurt has the role of Sir William Marshall, a wise courtier of King Richard who had helped defend and manage the nation while Richard is away.  Matthew Macfadyen plays he Sheriff of Nottingham and Kevin Durrand plays the massive Little John. Overall this film is good entertainment. It was not meant to be an accurate history lesson.",1285977600,3,4152,4.759722222222222
4194189,5,B003U0AHBO,"On Remakes:  People come into these remake movies and freak out because its not exactly like others before it, but if it is like others before it they freak out because it's unoriginal.  Darned if you do, Darned if you don't.  Personally i think that if your going to film a remake then you'd better be able to add something fresh to the story.  Robin Hood does this while keeping my favorite parts.

Casting & Acting:  Personally i think this is a very well done movie, the character of Robin Hood really came alive throughout along with superior casting for the rest of the movie as well.  Normally Kate Blanchett is fine but never has she had a performance that i've really liked.  She was perfect for Marian.  So casting and acting was wonderful.

Setting:  Wow.  No matter how many times i see Ridley Scott recreate the past it still amazes me.  Believe me when i say that this setting not only sparks the imagination and pleases the eyes, but it also pleases the mind with superior accuracy.  I couldn't ask for more.  And i am fairly picky with these kinds of things.

Overall:  It isn't perfect, but i have yet to see a truly perfect movie.  And no it's not as good as gladiator but yes it is close, and yes it is more then worth buying.  The last thing i think needs to be said is this: There are a lot of good movies out there and a lot of them are fun, but there aren't nearly as many that are both.

Instead of taking common sense steps to fix things and rein in spending, he determines to spend more, goes on the warpath against his already overtaxed barons to tax them further, thinking their coffers are bottomless. Later, upon learning of an impending foreign attack, and facing rebellion from his barons, he refuses to make peace and rally them against that threat; instead, he goes on the warpath against his own countrymen.

A ragtag group of citizens bands together to oppose the tax collectors and the corrupt, overtaxing government. (Note: My impression may be wrong. Nico1908 says: Erm, the ""ragtag group of citizens"" that opposed King John's taxation and ultimately persuaded him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215 were the barons, not the peasants, churls, serfs, etc. (see comments)).

Russel Crowe looked stiff to me, as if he did not embrace the role with anything more than I am here.  I do demand more character development and participation from movies that I like.

Yes, the history is a jumble of 11th thru 13th century events and items but this is one of the few movies that doesn't romaticize the times or even the characters. It is a far more realistic step backwards into legend and the ending of this BD leads one to the conclusion that Scott and Crowe want at least a second episode that tells more about the Robin Hood we thought we knew. Fine drama, great detail (watch for the hanging mouse on the goblet), and characters you enjoy.

I dare say this depiction is more accurate in the telling.  If you have seen  the other movies you will have to suspend your remembrance and reset the order of events.

4194220,1,B003U0AHBO,"I haven't laughed at a film so much in years!  Granted the first half is a bit flat but then the whole thing really picks up in quality.

The carefully interwoven references to other films are genius.  The beach landing scene is straight out of Saving Private Ryan (complete with Medieval Landing Craft and underwater shots of Frenchmen getting shot with arrows), there is a bit of Braveheart in there too.  And then Maid Marion turns up on the battlefield disguised as a knight in a suit of armour, straight out of Lord of the Rings.  Presumably the fight on the beach was inspired by Quodrophenia.  They missed a trick though, the final scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail would have crowned the entire epic had it been used, a couple of coppers turning up to arrest the naughty kerniggots.  Don't miss this wonderful rollercoaster through Medieval legend (or is that a steam train)?

Note to producers, its highly unlikely that anyone could get to Dungeness from Nottingham and fight a battle in a couple of days (forget Harold's epic march from Stamford Bridge - the one up North, not in West London).  Its probably at elast 150 miles. And Kent must have changed quite a bit since the 1200s.  Those white cliffs at Dungeness seemed to have now eroded into a shingle beach.  Surely they could have used the real Dungeness and disguised the nuclear power station as a castle?

Well done to the person who wrote the musical score, the bit where Russel Crowe remembers his hitherto forgotten childhood, I wouldn't have realised that I was supposed to get all emotional without those sobbing violins.  I quite expected a bit of Bryan Adams too but you can't have everything.  At least they all lived happily ever after and King John turned out to be a right villain after all.

I added the blu-ray director's cut to my permanent DVD library.

In this movie (and in places not far away)  myopic leaders have betrayed England by invading the world, forgetting their history and culture, and in borrowing against their future so they are now in hock to other nations who of course have ambitions and interests of their own and are a threat to the sovereignty of England.

In Scott's movie, King Richard the Lionheart has bankrupted England with his military adventuring in Muslim lands. Whilst Richard's brother and rival, the weak but cunning King John, makes a nave alliance with a rapacious French king and then sets about to gather every last coin from the poor families of England.

4194223,4,B003U0AHBO,"I don't know why I listened to all the bad reviews when this came out. Scott is one of the best directors alive, I think, and aside from Kingdom Of Heaven I've loved most everything he's done. I should have known he'd deliver a unique Robin Hood, and he did. This director's cut version, while long, gets better as it goes and looks absolutely gorgeous on blu-ray.

I saw on the box that it was 2:35 and groaned, but after a decent opening RH just keeps getting better and by halfway I was glad that I had so much left to enjoy. The sets and scenery are stunning, the script more intelligent than most, and there are fine performances from almost everyone, especially Hurt, Von Sydow, Blanchett and Crowe.

I can't help but like Crowe in every role he takes on. He personifies the trustworthy honest guy, rarely more so than here. This story is not the normal robbing hood tale, but rather the backstory of how RH became The Legend; it's a more political picture of the Crusades and England vs. France than one would have expected, and Crowe makes Robin thoroughly believable. It's hard not to root for him, and his appropriately edgy chemistry with Cate works nicely. Errol Flynn may have been the perfectly breezy Robin, but Crowe brings a depth that Flynn never essayed. Crowe and Scott hit a peak in Gladiator, and they're not far off that mark here. Not quite there, but still damn good.

There's only a small dose of cheese in RH, mostly in the last hour. The climactic battle goes on a little too long, though it's certainly epic; no CGI here. The whole film looks typically Ridley ravishing, and there are some gorgeous shots of the English countryside in full spring bloom that take the breath away. King John is done well by Isaac, and Hurt and the apparently immortal Von Sydow bring real gravitas to their roles. I rarely left the world of this film once I got into it, and that's not easy for a 155 minute flick.

So, lesson learned: trust your favorite directors and actors more than your favorite critics!

PS The blu-ray is exemplary, marrying a perfect transfer to an hourlong doc that's truly worth watching, a commentary with pictures by Scott, some deleted scenes that are actually as good as the film and could easily have been included, and a few other extras. A film this carefully shot deserves hi-def and it gets it here. This is one film worth getting on BD rather than dvd, no doubt.

4194224,3,B003U0AHBO,"I was very appreciative of the grand way in which Ridley Scott told this story, but it was rather bothersome to hear them speak about Richard the Lionhearted by calling the crusades ""his crusades"". Scott throws in a scene where the Robin is talking about killing women and children at some battle, and how the muslims only looked on the english with pity, as though they are above savage actions.
This added a political tinge that i felt was un necessary, and coupled with the free to be you and ""lesson"" that robin gives everyone, and the very hippie-ish ending, i found that this went from an entertaining film to some kind of lesson.

For those that are bothered by such things as this, I suppose these are valid reasons to criticize the movie.  On the other hand, if you are a movie viewer whose main incentive to attend any movie is to see a good tale, well told, then this movie is for you. It is a wonderful story best described as a prologue to the legend that we know so well. It takes nothing away from the legend but adds much.  Ridley Scott produces marvelous images. His films are always visually arresting.  ""Robin Hood"" is full of beautiful scenes and even the brutal battle segments are eye candy.  There is not a poorly acted character in the movie.  Crowe and Blanchett are superb in their parts and Oscar Isaac is a truly nefarious and duplicitous King John.

The story is the beginning of the Robin Hood story and tell of Robin Longstride and how he became Robin Hood. This movie in forums has been said to be made in planning for a sequel. I really hope they make a sequel to this great movie because it deserves one.
 The movie itself has quite a few great actors and actresses and they all hold their parts very well and keep the story very interesting. When I saw it in theaters with some family of a younger age 18 and 15 they said it had too much dialogue but on the contrary I thought the dialogue added to the legend and back story quite well and engrossed me in the film. I have always been a big fan of Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett and in this movie I thought they fit their roles perfectly. The story was great and the quality of the soundtrack was epic and the usual for a Ridley Scott movie. I will not delve into story because you have to see it to really enjoy the greatness of this movie.

The philosophical conversations the movie might inspire, both political and ethical, would allow for insight into for our own world:  To what extent does political allegience color our definitions?  To what extent might war encroach the definition of murder?  How might an increased awareness of how power has been mis-used inform our attitudes?  Stuff like that.  Questions to ask and conversations to be had with friends after viewing the movie with a cup of chocolate.

Most of the bets made by Hollywood have relied on the inability of studios to lose money underestimating the taste and intellect of the American public.  This iteration of 'Robin Hood' appeals to a diminishing demographic.

Russell Crowe seems lost, Cate Blanchett is far too classy for this film, and Max von Sydow phones in his performance. Although I'm usually a fan of Ridley Scott's work, this one is just an unfortunate misfire--I wonder whether he has forgotten how to tell a story. The numerous villains in this story are poorly developed (as are just about all of the supporting characters), the plot--which wanders aimlessly--is unnecessarily complicated by irrelevant subplots and revisions to the standard Robin Hood tale, and the whole thing devolves into a boring, pathetic mess. Perhaps Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland were hoping to breathe new life into this classic tale, but they ultimately sucked the last vestige of vitality right out of it.",1285459200,6,909,5.066666666666666
4194231,4,B003U0AHBO,"After ten long years of warring abroad, Sir Robert Loxley has at last come home to Nottingham, except that Nottingham is not his real home or is his name truly Robert Loxley. A common archer, a veteran of the bloody Crusades, Robin Longstride has stepped into a nobleman's shoes to fulfill an oath sworn on blood. There's very much this whiff of THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE.

Elsewhere in 12th century England, with the death of his brother King Richard the Lion Heart, the hedonistic Prince John ascends to the throne, only to inherit a near impoverished realm. And since John has never been the most stable of royals, his reign is launched on a tenuous note. King John rapidly imposes a crippling tax policy which then revolts the Norman barons.

King Philip of France senses welcome strife within the English borders and seizes the opportunity to deploy his invasion fleet, and this spearheaded by the turncoat Sir Godfrey, former confidante to King John. From this backdrop of war and displeasure and deceit, Robin Hood emerges.

I think I'll never tire of new reimaginings of these iconic literary figures, from Sherlock Holmes to Zorro to Robin Hood, and a few others. Manly man Russell Crowe and old guy Ridley Scott reunite in this try at redefining the Robin Hood mythos, or at least they offer a peek at the man behind the legend, perhaps place him in a more historically accurate context (Is that the Magna Carta I see that King John is sneering at?). This incarnation is certainly gritty and earthy and more brooding than other recent adaptations. It's certainly more serious, more ambitious than Kevin Costner's opus. It sets the stage for Robin Longstride's evolving into the legendary Robin of the Hood, depicts what Robin Hood was like before he was Robin Hood.

The action is infrequent. You'll be disappointed if you come in seeking non-stop thrills and spills and constant feats of astounding archery. This movie takes its time telling its story, sets a leisurely pace. Action junkies might think it slow. Robin Longstride arrives at Nottingham only after an hour into the film, and the story then builds his presence as the English lord returned from the battles and getting to know his villagers, getting accepted by them. So that when Robin later rallies the contentious troops, you do get the sense that he's earned that place in the sun. Russell Crowe carries enough gravitas to pull this off with ease. Trivia: Ridley Scott had asked Russell to mimic the hair and beard of Maximus from GLADIATOR for this project. Because if you're gonna lift from something, why not lift from your own movie?

Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion Loxley is most awesome, not at all that classic helpless maid in need of rescuing. Cate's fierceness and intelligence make her a pound for pound match for Russell Crowe's brawny presence. I would never have thought of Cate Blanchett in this role, but she is riveting, again.

This being a fresh spin, certain stuff looks distorted; some of the Robin Hood tropes have been swept aside. In fact, if you were to replace these very familiar names, this story may well be unrecognizable. This is before Robin became Robin Hood, so it makes sense that there aren't much of those forest outlaw shenanigans or merry men scampering around. What we get, instead, are grimy orphan boys hiding out in Sherwood Forest, a subplot that doesn't get fleshed out enough (although, okay, it's already a long enough movie). No famous first encounter at the bridge between Robin and Little John; instead, we get a shell game. Tuck is not only a friar, he's also a beekeeper. Instead of Sir Guy of Gisbourne, we get Sir Godfrey who, as played by the always sinister Mark Strong, seems vile enough. Even more tellingly, the Sheriff of Nottingham barely registers a presence, although he is seen ogling the fair Lady Marion. So he's despicable, but not without good taste in women. Jeff Bridges as the royal purse holder, I think, strives for an English accent but doesn't really carry it off. But it doesn't hamper the film.

I showed up for the myhos and the big battles. I stayed for the compelling period drama. Ridley Scott's ROBIN HOOD is, frankly, not as sweeping or epic as I had anticipated, and the battle scenes aren't so impressive or audacious. The story seldom allows Robin to spring into action. But the stuff going on between Robin and Marion keeps you engaged. I liked this movie quite a bit, but it's still not my favorite Robin Hood adaptation (that would be Errol Flynn's take on the thing, and then probably Sean Connery's). And if you've got a yen for more interpretations of Robin Hood but in book form, take a crack at Robin McKinley's THE OUTLAWS OF SHERWOOD or Parke Godwin's SHERWOOD. Ridley Scott's ROBIN HOOD gets 3.5 out of 5 stars out of me.",1285459200,2,4797,4.765342960288809

4194233,2,B003U0AHBO,"I finally saw this movie on television recently and I stand by my review.

Though I'm a Russell Crowe fan, Crowe's age was an issue here for me.
Russell was too old for this part and appears overweight and winded. In the time of Robin Hood, a 46 yr old man was OLD.  I could not see Crowe as a passionate and spritely youth running through the forests committing deeds of daring-do.  I'd have prefered to see a young man of about 20-25 play the part, as that would have rung truer.
As for Cate Blanchett, as beautiful and talented as she is, she's also too old here.  Marion was a teenage maiden, not a 40 yr old widow.

Now to the story... they threw in everything here but the kitchen sink.
Robin Hood is made out to be the literal savior of England and the creator of the phrase ""A man's home is his castle"" and his father to be the originator of the Magna Carta! ...Sheezz... The whole film feels ponderous and Crowe lacks charisma.

Judging from other reviews herein and that this film was pulled from theaters in my area in less than a week, it seems to have been a box office bust.

FYI: There's a female extra in one scene, standing in front of a royal reception lineup, appearing totally out of place. She looks like a Hollywood Housewife who's had too much plastic surgery and wearing far too much makeup, totally breaking the scene.  She must've actually been someone's wife who wanted to be in the film. (chuckle)
The only good thing good about this film is the authentic 'look' it has, except for that Hollywood Housewife.

For instance, Robin pinning a French commander against a barn door with arrows, demanding to be told an important plot point; Robin 'down with the kids in the hood' teaching them a thing or two about survival; Like Kingdom of Heaven before it the director's cut MAKES the film come together. Marshall (William Hurt) tells Robin some home truths about his past and it now makes perfect sense why he shouts 'Longfellow' before the final battle scenes. Also Robin gets to tell the Sheriff of Nottingham where to go too.
The French trying to land on English shores is pure novelisation and is just to have some artistic licence but it is true that a larger attempt was made by the French in 1215/16 so 'it could have happened' and who knows what the ships of the day looked like?
The setting of this tale in a period before the Magna Carta was finally signed by bad old King John in 1215 is a masterstroke. So King John does not sign anything in this version as the year is around 1200 so it does not conflict with history, as he was known to be very reluctant to give the people a charter of rights.

Interestingly, this gritty representation of the Robin Hood legend eschews just about every element in the various Robin Hood movies and TV shows made over the years. Scott went on record as stating the only Robin Hood movie he thought was good was ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" by Mel Brooks.

SPOILERS:

Robin (Russell Crowe)serves under King Richard (Danny Huston in an all too brief appearence)as an archer and isn't anything more than an intelligent peasant. Richard and his men continue to plunder other kingdoms on their way back from the Crusades to rebuild the coffers of the king. When Richard is killed in battle, Robin takes the opportunity to return home masquerading as Robert of Loxley a Knight ambushed and killer while trying to return the King's crown to England by Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong)an English knight secretly working for the French. The dying Robert convinces Robin to return his sword to his father (Max Von Sydow)to make amends as the two had a falling out years before. Pretending to be Robert of Loxley has its privledges but also forces Robin and his compatriots to stay in Nottingham with Robin playing the role of Robert husband to Marion (Cate Blanchett)so as to protect the Loxley land from seizure by the Sheriff of Nottingham (an idea proposed by Robert's father). In the process Robin discovers a secret to his past and the fate of his own father.

END OF SPOILERS:

Taking substanial liberties with the Robin Hood legend, Scott and writer Brian Hedgeland (""L.A. Confidential"")takes a number of creative and unexpected turns in retelling the legend of Robin. Based on ANOTHER screenplay that tackled the same subject giving the Sheriff of Nottingham a more sympathetic role, the film went through rewrites up to and including the actual shooting of the film. Usually this results in a disjointed project (and isn't that unusual for Scott's films but often results in mixed results)but Scott and his cast manager to pull the film together. Reportedly the film had uncredited rewrites by playwright Tom Stoppard as well to give a sense of depth to the characters. Crowe does an interesting variation on his performance from ""Gladiator"" here creating a Robin weary of war who just wants to return home.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice capturing the earthen tones and gritty look of the film.

We get both the theatrical and ""Director's Cut"" of the film (the latter runs about 15 minutes longer)as well as deleted scenes, featurettes, etc. that give us some insight into why Scott chose to go in the direction he did with this project. The theatrical vesion can be viewed with the ""Director's Notebook"" which has behind-the-scenes footage, drawings by Scott and interviews. Interesting, Scott chose not to do a commentary track for this edition (or Universal is withholding it for a deluxe edition later down the line). We also get a DVD version of the film as well as a digital copy designed to download to portable playing devices.

Although ""Robin Hood"" lacks the dramatic power and impact of Scott's last two historical epic films (""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""), he does a nice job of defying expectations based on previous tellings of the same tale. This is a marked improvement over Kevin Reynolds' film (with Kevin Costner) from over a decade ago and Crowe at least makes Robin a believable character within the context of Scott's universe. This is far from Scott's best film but it is entertaining and if it runs a tad long (both versions), the performances will keep you engaged. I liked the film (which means I had to give it four stars--I would have given it three which to me means it's a ""good"" but not outstanding film if not for how amazon defines 3 vs. 4 stars).

I suspect many of the negative reviews reflect disappointment with the way the story has been told compared to previous incarnations of ""Robin Hood"". The ""Director's Cut"" IS superior to the theatrical version adding in a couple of scenes and extending others that improve the drama. ""Robin Hood"" is more of a period film with action rather than an action film with period touches. The action isn't quite as intense as ""Gladiator"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven"" but they are also in service to a very different story.

I'd recommend ""Robin Hood"" reservations--the pacing in the first half ia a bit turgid and it plays more like a prequel to ANOTHER film about ""Robin Hood"" but is still enjoyable.",1285286400,3,4688,4.894206549118388
4194244,2,B003U0AHBO,"I have a lot of problems with this movie.  It seems a shame that an actor of Russel Crowe's caliber cannot get a decent movie to display his skills in. If you are going to title a movie ""Robin Hood"" then I think that the story should have something to do with the fable of Robin Hood! There was nothing at all in this movie that I recognized from the story of Robin Hood that I am familiar with.  It is like the writers of this movie simply took the names from the original tale, and gave them to unrelated characters in this movie.  The only thing recognizable from the tale of Robin Hood (Robin being declared outlaw, Sherwood Forest, his merry men, etc.) all takes place in the last 15 minutes of the movie.

The rest of the movie has lots of epic battles, armies clashing, cavalry charges, etc.  Which was very well done and very interesting to watch.  However, I would have liked to see a little color.  For an epic movie, it seems the directors decided to go with true to life, which means that everything from clothes, buildings, background and everything is in shades of black, brown and gray.  Even the nobles, dressed in silk, brocade and jewels, were all in washed out, dull colors. The movie might just as well have been filmed in black and white.  With all the amazing fabrics and materials, in every color of the rainbow, covered with pearls, sequins, crystals, etc.,  we have at our fingertips today, I am absolutely comfounded that nobody in Hollywood seems inclined to use any of them. If you are filming in color, how about showing us some color?  Yes, I know that in the middle ages, nobody bathed, everybody had feas and rats, and dressed in drab clothes, etc.  But I am dammed well not interested in a history lesson when I watch a movie for entertainment.  Am I the only one who does not particularly want ""historical accuracy"" in my movies? I am heartily sick to death of historical accuracy. I think that is used as an excuse by directors with no imagination who can't figure out what else to do. If I want to study middle age history, art, society, building, or anything else, I am fully capable of doing so on my own.  Robin Hood is a fable---and I like my fables to have knights in shinning armor with rich trapings, my ladies elaborately dressed in beautiful colors, castles that don't look like mouldering ruins, feast tables that are not overrun with rodents, and characters who do not look like they don't bathe, stink, and have lice and feas.

This movie is worth watching for its epic battle scenes, but not for anything else. Even the ending is depressing. King John had promised reformation in order to get his nobles and people to fight for him. In the end, King John has broken his word and proven himself to be a lier, cheat and tyrant. Which means that all the people who had suffered, fought and died, did so for nothing. Everything that Robin Hood had done was for nothing. The tyrant wins and everybody else loses. That is far too close to what happens in real life for me to view it with anything but distaste. Robin is declared outlaw, along with all his friends. And Marion, her home and lands seized by the crown, has to go into outlawry with him. Nor is there going to be any rescue from King John.  In this version of the story, John has not stolen the throne. Richard is dead, and John is the sole heir. He has inherited the throne legally, and for life. And he is not likely to be issuing any pardons.  If you want the romantic and beauiful fable of Robin Hood, check out the old version with Errol Flynn.  That movie was made in the days when they still knew how to make movies for entertainment, movies that left you feeling good.",1285286400,4,3682,4.42962962962963

I admit I don't know much about the general mythos of Robin Hood itself other than the ""steal from the rich and give to the poor"" ideal and various names of the characters. My experience with the franchise is limited to 1973's animated Disney film and 1991's Prince of Thieves, of which I'd say it's been at least 15+ years since viewing either. I do, however, know of Ridley Scott and his penchant for being a very detail-oriented director, especially in period pieces. And with that said, my expectations for this re-visioning of Robin Hood lore were set somewhere between ""really high"" for the production side of things and ""to be surprised"" for the story (going in as a blank slate). Thankfully, I wasn't let down on either end. Robin Hood (2010) is the origins story of Robin Longstride, an archer who served under King Richard during the Crusades that, under some dire circumstances, came to inherit the identity of Sir Robert Loxley. Upon returning to England, he would assume the life of Sir Loxley in Nottingham and make some discoveries about his true past that would eventually turn him into the outlaw of legend, Robin of the Hood. There are sub-plots and conspiracies abound throughout such as the genesis of Prince John's tyranny, the betrayal of Godfrey, and the invasion of the French, which, for all intents and purposes, never manage to bore. But what I love about the film, in addition to its storytelling, is its balance of thematic elements and truly exuberant production design. We get to see the foundation for Robin's beliefs established, a little bit of (unexpected) whimsical comedy between his comrades and initial relationship with Lady Marion, some inspiring drama about the freedoms of choice and its rise against the rule of oppression, and, of course, a bevy of stunningly photographed action sequences. As a result, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film and really hope they make a sequel, given how much they've built things up and  established a grittier kind of portrayal for this new Robin universe. I've read many a negative review saying the story isn't representative enough of the Robin Hood they ""know,"" but considering the nature of legends and folklore in the first place (and the fact that this is a movie), who's to say a little re-interpretation isn't allowed every now and then? Casino Royale and Batman Begins rebooted their respective franchises and seem to have garnered a good amount of critical reception. Not to mention, the original screenplay for Robin turned out to be something like 7 hours long (all the more reason for a sequel or two). But regardless of the truncation for what could be a massive epic, I, for one, am very happy with what Sir Ridley has managed to create here by way of a great crew and cast of actors. If you haven't seen this yet, I highly recommend the Director's Cut, and that version only. It's only 16 minutes longer, but much like Kingdom of Heaven, those minutes really make the difference.

Video - 5.0

Photographed by John Mathieson, his second Ridley Scott medieval-project after Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood looks spectacular. Overall saturation and filtering are a smidgen on the dark side, and colors are a little subdued and less vibrant than could be, but I absolutely love the filmic texture and theatrical feeling it brings to the picture. Being set 20 years after the events of Kingdom (no direct correlation to the story, but just as an example of aesthetic continuity) and at the end of the Third Crusades, I really like the kind of grimy ""aftermath"" effect the photography has in showing the harshness of poverty for all the townsfolk and how it sets a much darker and realistic tone for this new Robin incarnation. Greens, browns, blue, silver, and black tend to be the most noticeable colors within the artistic palette and may not be as awe-striking to others as it is to myself, but I personally find it refreshing to see such elaborate and authentic-looking costumes, props, and sets (without the inferior MPEG-2 encode *cough* Kingdom) in all their glory. Contrast is especially excellent, revealing a lot of the tiny lines in facial features, armor, and various background objects. Black levels are deep and inky as well, providing some great shadow delineation and nighttime shots, of which the latter has very little presence of noise, if any. But my biggest praise goes to the image detail. Despite having a slightly darker look, overall detail always maintains a reference level of sharpness. Everything from beard stubble and hair, down to the notches and kinks in armor and weapons show an immaculate sense of depth. And to top things off, the fine layer of film grain present throughout the movie is never bothered in the least. There are also no signs of artifacting or debris to speak of and what looks to be zero traces of EE, DNR, and banding. This is one of my favorite BD transfers of the current year, and with the beautiful cinematography, should be a visual delight for fans of the film.

Audio - 5.0

Equally as impressive as its video transfer, the audio transfer for Robin is just as immersive. About 5 minutes into the film (the French castle invasion, yet again) the movie just opens up with what seems like an auditory overload of creaking wood, screaming soldiers, clanging metal, burning fires, and flying arrows all about the sound field, followed by a healthy dose of LFEs upon the ignition of some oil bombs stuck to the castle gate. Spatial separation and directionality are key in providing listeners with a sense of ambience. And while the action is dispersed in chunks throughout the film, you'll be sure to hear the transition when it happens. However, what blew me away the most wasn't the fullness of the blockbuster-esque sound effects, but the subtlety of the dynamics and all the little noises. Buzzing bees travel about the front and rear surrounds with amazing clarity, while the jingling and jangling of chainmails give the film a very 12th-century authenticity (as if the visual aspect didn't do it enough already). Dialogue is fairly centered for the most part, but does pan a little from the sides here and there whenever Max von Sydow's character is around. It's not a problem at all (and is actually kind of cool to hear), never resulting in lost lines or awkward mumbling. It's as much of a Ridley Scott Robin Hood movie as you could ask for with a great deal of balance in every audio aspect. Also, I really have to give my praise to Marc Streitenfeld for a wonderfully composed score. In the extras, he said that 12th-century music is something that can't really be pinpointed based on what little knowledge there is about the instrumentation of the period. But with that aside, he still infuses a great Celtic orchestral feel that manages to be as epic and adventurous as the rest of the film. Low ends from the music, horse hooves, and various heavy hits round out this reference track in terms of general LFEs.

Extras - 3.5

The extras are something of a disappointment for me. While Scott's other period masterpieces (Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven) got hours upon hours of bonus features (Kingdom of Heaven on the 4-disc DVD, anyway), those presented here on Robin Hood feel much more underwhelming. To start, there's the ""Director's Notebook,"" a P-i-P commentary that's only available for the Theatrical Cut of the film where Scott and various cast and crew talk about the making of the film. It plays a lot like Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode, though I have to say it's not nearly as immersive. There's a lot of empty space between sequences where nothing happens at all, and when the interviews/commentary do pop up, it's only for a mere matter of 4 to 5-minute chunks, hardly representative of the work I feel they must've put in. Outside of the commentary, the meat of the extras are crammed into a 1-hour behind-the-scenes feature, ""Rise and Rise Again: The Making of Robin Hood."" Here, it covers pre-production (18 minutes), production (29 minutes), and post-production (15 minutes). Sadly, it's in SD and totals only an hour in length, as opposed to an hour per segment and in HD on a separate BD. While it's a pretty informative look at the workmanship that went into making this film, I really wish these extras were given a more thorough and in-depth presentation. And how about a segment or two on the past interpretations of Robin Hood, or maybe interviews/comments from historians or scholars interested in the myth and what they like about this new Robin in comparison? But alas, it seems someone decided to stymie up on the extras. To end things, there are also deleted scenes with commentary, picture galleries, and a section for all the trailers and TV spots of the film. Hopefully, if there's a sequel it'll get the special features it deserves.

Overall - 4.5

I've recently become a big fan of Sir Ridley Scott these past few years and really appreciate his fine attention to detail in film-making. I also don't know much about the legend of Robin Hood either, but I like the apparently darker tone this new Robin takes. It's not quite as gloomy as Gladiator, nor is it as thematically heavy as Kingdom of Heaven. However, I like how it borrows just enough from both, adapts those elements with this iconic hero, and manages to give the myth a fresh twist. Presented by Universal with reference A/V quality, though a ""could've been better"" set of extras, Robin Hood (2010) comes highly recommended.",1285286400,4,9508,4.809785932721713

4194247,4,B003U0AHBO,"ROBIN HOOD is a solid movie; it is less on the Errol Flynn format than most people expected and more on setting up the background for the blossoming of the infamous Robin Hood, and if the last few minutes of the film can be believed, there is likely a sequel in the mind of Ridley Scott!  Once the audience accepts the fact that they are not in store for film about a happy-go-lucky thief who robs form the rich to pay the poor then this film settles into a fine examination of the corrupt government of England, barely surviving during King Richard the Lionheart's (Danny Huston) 10 year absence in the Crusades.  We see the state of the Church, the presence of espionage and greed that depletes the people of England with high taxes and confiscation of land and food and seed to plant.  It is a sad state of affairs with only a few strongholds of honesty and survival - focused here on Nottingham, governed by the blind Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) and his daughter Marion (Cate Blanchett), the young boys having taken to the forest as feral huntsmen, and  whose grain houses are pilfered to the point of starvation.  Along comes Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) who has been asked by the dying king to deliver his crown to the Queen (Eileen Atkins), which in turn makes his smarmy brother John (Oscar Isaac) the new king.  One evil treacherous Godfrey (Mark Strong, the Hollywood movies' requisite bad guy) wiles his way into the good graces of King John, ostensibly replacing the court advisor William Marshall (William Hurt) and planning for the destruction of Robin Longstride. Meanwhile Robin takes refuge with the Loxley household, being named 'husband' of the widowed Marion for protection.  The remainder of this very long film  is about Robin's learning about his heritage, his participation in squelching the Normandy Invasion, his gathering of his loyal merry men - Friar Tuck (Mark Addy), Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) - becoming Robin Hood, his teaching the feral boys of the forest how to fight, and his falling in love with Marion, all under the watchful eyes of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfayden) and Godfrey.  All's well that end's well and let's hope that screenwriter Brian Helgeland has a sequel ready to start filming with Ridley Scott!

The scenery is beautiful when it is not all muddy and overcast and John Mathiesen has captured the flavor of 12th century England well.  Marc Streitenfeld composed the score that is for the most part embarrassingly unremarkable.  One of the finest aspects of the film can be attributed to Ron Diamond who is in charge of the terrific art of the opening and closing titles - really fine art work and animation.  It is a mature person's ROBIN HOOD - and it works very well!  Grady Harp, September 10",1285200000,2,2831,4.774590163934426
4194248,3,B003U0AHBO,"This is a fantastic film but Ridley Scott has set a pretty high standard with extras on the DVD release of his films.

4194250,4,B003U0AHBO,"This is yet another telling of the tale of Robin Hood.  However, this tale is one that relates how Robin Hood became an outlaw.  I enjoyed it very much.  But the real theme was the fight against the arrogance of leadership, most particularly that of King Edward of England.  I could not help myself from thinking how it reminded me of the arrogance of our current leadership in Washington with Obama, Reid and Pelosi ignoring the people's wishes because they either think they know better or because they must defeat dissidence by almost any subterfuge if it threatens their power.  The more their power is threatened the more arrogant and deceitful they become.  I am not limiting my observation to only Democrats but Republicans as well.  It just happens that our current leadership is principally Democrat and should bear the brunt of the American people's anger at this time.  Of course, the abuse of power is more sophisticated today than it was in the story of Robin Hood in 12th century England, but the amount of power is much greater today, particularly economic power.  So, what I thought was a very good movie, particularly the Russell Crowe portrayal of Robin Hood, which was similar to his role in Gladiator but without much of the sadness experienced by the character, it was somewhat disheartening because I was reminded that the world politics has not changed that much since the dark ages.  I only wish I could have viewed the film solely for its entertainment value without the reminders of deceit and arrogance of government.  Hopefully others can view the film without comparison to modern times.  Lastly, while this film may not be suitable for younger viewers, the graphic violence was less than what I have seen in films like this which should provide families with older kids with some good entertainment.",1285027200,4,1829,4.864516129032258

4194254,5,B003U0AHBO,"First of all, this interpretation of the Robin Hood story is probably the most realistic one ever done as well as one of the best acted.  No ""wink wink nod nod"" scenes, no shrill ""didn't we tape your mouth shut in the Abyss"" Maid Marion and no Americanized English for Robin.  This was Robin Hood for ""grown ups"" and unabashedly so.  Ridley Scott deserves praise for this movie.

As to the reviewers who rated the movie much lower than I'd have imagined it deserved, I understand that everyone has an opinion and art is in the eye of the beholder.  However, I am shocked that some of the comments are so vile concerning the screenplay and the actors.  If you came into this expecting ""Gladiator,"" or you wanted graphic sex scenes or were hoping that you'd understand the story more because you're used to the Kevin Costner or Errol Flynn ""Robin Hood,"" then I understand your low ratings.  This movie was an attempt to combine the history of the times (with some liberal skewing between the centuries in some cases) with quality acting (understated in some cases but always top notch) and pacing that fit the story vs. the ADHD that audiences tend to have these days, victims of CGI and MTV styled battles.

4194258,2,B003U0AHBO,"ROBIN HOOD had promise.  Russell Crowe as the titular anti-hero (here, an archer named Robin Longstride); Cate Blanchett as Maid Marion (Marion Loxley); Mark Strong as the insidious villain (no longer the Sheriff of Nottingham, reduced here to a minor character); and supporting roles from heavyweights William Hurt, Max von Sydow, and Danny Houston.  Throw in Ridley Scott directing, and Brian Helgeland (MYSTIC RIVER) penning the script, and you've got the key ingredients for a movie masterpiece, right?

Right.  Except it never congeals.  First of all, the film isn't at all realistic; an ordinary archer manages to impersonate a knight?  Also, and this is the worst fault: the script is unbelievably shallow.  So shallow, in fact, that I can't help but wonder if this is Helgeland's script at all, or if the studio didn't do some trimming to make this a bit more streamlined.  Crowe and Blanchett are reliably strong, but their characters are two-dimensional; Strong, a fantastic villain actor, has absolutely nothing to do but walk around glaring.  Only Oscar Issac as Prince John, and Danny Houston as King Richard, have any meat to sink their fangs into; and neither actor is in the film very much.

Scott and Crowe were clearly aiming for GLADIATOR territory, unabashedly so.  Instead, they should've focused on crafting a unique, original film.  The climax is a let-down, the pacing is off; the cinematography is beautiful, and the premise is good, but ROBIN HOOD is, unfortunately, not the film we've been waiting for.

Marion and Robin's storyline is sweet and should satisfy women who detest ""guy"" movies. There are battle scenes but they are played out in fast forward clashes that are not horrifically violent because there is so much going on and it moves so fast that the violence is mostly flickers and images.

4194260,4,B003U0AHBO,"Ridley Scott's version of Robin Hood isn't the version you're used to. This tells the mythical story of Robin Hood before he became an outlaw and lived in Sherwood Forest. Of course the story of Robin Hood is one of a lot of mythology and possibly a little bit of fact. No one knows the real story. Chances are that film/book depictions of ""Robin Hood"" are completely wrong, so it's difficult to say if this movie is realistic in any way, shape, or form - minus the historical accuracies dealing with the king of England.

This version of Robin Hood is probably the best I've seen. It's very entertaining, and not a ""big, dumb action movie."" It's not on the level of Ridley's Gladiator, but I think it's a big leap ahead of Kingdom of Heaven (the theatrical release, at least).

The problem with Robin Hood is the ending. *Warning: spoilers ahead if you don't know the story of Robin Hood* I have not seen the director's cut yet but I would hope that between the final 2 scenes in the film there's something stuck in between them as a bridge. You go from a pretty mediocre beach battle to the king declaring Robin Hood as an outlaw. It feels like they had to cut something, or they just got tired with the film and wanted it to end and they rushed through the final scenes. At any rate, the film almost completely falls apart at the end, though the shots of Robin Hood going into Sherwood Forest make up for a bit.

Ultimately, this is one of the most watchable films of the last couple of years. It's not perfect by any stretch, but it's entertaining and one that I could watch over and over again. It has that kind of vibe to it. Other films I put in that category (in recent release) are the Hurt Locker, Shutter Island, The Wrestler. Just films that I can watch and be entertained by no matter how many times I've seen them. That's good company, and though critics panned Robin Hood, you should give it a shot. As I said, from a technical standpoint I can see it's flaws, but this is a very entertaining movie, and sometimes that's good enough for me.",1284508800,46,2055,4.37434554973822

It sets up the elements for the story that we all know and love.  My only problem with the film came in the climatic battle.  Maid Marion enters the fray and brings along all of the young boys from the forest riding on their donkeys.  Very irresponsible of her and also unrealistic.

Russell Crowe, regardless of how temperamental a person he may be, is a great actor and very convincing in his role.  We're glad Cate Blanchett managed to put her eco-freakism aside long enough to wash her hair so that Robin could stand to kiss her.

4194268,4,B003U0AHBO,"Most stories revolving around the notorious outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor have a humorous twist and take place during the height of Robin's career as a thief. This time around, however, Ridley Scott takes us back to the origins of the legend...

With most of the men in Nottingham off to war on the Crusades with Richard ""the Lion Heart,"" their wives and daughters are left to fend for themselves in near-poverty. In the ten years since her husband's departure, Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett) has managed to see her tenants taken care of, in spite of five seasons of lean gathering and oppression both from the government's need for taxes, and the interference of the Church, who requires a large donation annually from the parish. Her husband Robin Loxley meanwhile is making the final push through France with Richard, in the hope of soon returning home. But the French are unwilling to go down without a fight and the monarchy summons an English assassin with ties to their court to put an end to Richard's life. Godfrey (Mark Strong) is well trusted by Richard's younger brother Prince John (Oscar Isaac), and it is believed he can sway John toward unpopular policies, which will divide England and ultimately cause it to fall to foreign invasion.

Caught up in the midst of it all is Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), a notable archer who is tired of war and simply wants to return across the channel. When Richard is killed in combat, Robin comes across the assassin and his party and makes a promise to Loxley that he will return Loxley's sword to his father, and tell him of his noble death. Knowing he will not be permitted to travel safely unless he is a knight, Robin and his friends borrow identities and reach the shores of England, where he presents the crown to Eleanor of Aquitaine (Eileen Atkins). Determined to keep his word, Robin then travels to Nottingham, not realizing that this decision will impact the course of his life forever...

The critics are panning this and I am not altogether certain why, because it certainly is epic on every level. The director knows his craft in creating sweeping, romantic and often brutal cinematic experiences and this is no different from most of his costume drama projects in that it is glorious to look at, with gorgeous cinematography and excellent performances. Cate and Russell have immediate tension and chemistry, and their romance as it unfolds is both fun to watch and crackles with the promise of future passion. The two bicker and banter and exchange lingering glances and when they finally get around to their first kiss, it is as meaningful as it is tender. The supporting cast is notable as well, with an alternately irritating and likable King John -- at times, we almost feel sorry for him, and then he does something unforgivably pathetic and we retreat into hating him once again. The most glorious villain is Mark Strong, who snarls and grins his way through his scenes, burning houses to the ground, slaughtering anyone who crosses his path, and even stabbing an old blind man through the heart. If that's not a bad guy you can root against, I don't know what is.

I suppose some amount of complaining could be launched in the direction this film took, in establishing that Robin is not who other films says he is,  but since I have never particularly liked any of the goofier representations of the character, I for one am not complaining over a massive re-envisioning. If you go into it knowing this is not your traditional Robin Hood, I think you will find it engaging. True, the beginning does jump around a bit in establishing all the different characters and happenings in two separate nations, and Richard is not all that likable, but once Robin arrives in England the pace picks up and Scott's talent as a director gleams particularly in the last half. I liked the nuances of the characters; Robin is of course likable, but Friar Tuck now raises bees (and gleefully sets them on some French soldiers at one point), Little John has a bit of a temper, and Marion has been transformed from a damsel in distress to a feminist icon who can more than look out for herself. There are little moments and instances of humor, but for the most part it is a serious drama.

All in all, it's not what you might expect from the tale but is a re-imagining that left me with a smile on my face. It's fun once in awhile to just sit in a theater seat and enjoy the experience, and that ultimately is what can be said of Robin Hood: a few blatant historical inaccuracies aside, it is not meant to be taken too seriously, and in that regard it's just what I love most: a rousing adventure.",1281571200,4,4666,4.642857142857143

I really liked the opening seige in France and while the final beach battle is good too, I couldn't help thinking it looked a bit like Saving Private Ryan. The Liberty speech reminded me of several other similar efforts and the lost boys of Sherwood Forrest had a distinct Peter Pan (with a Wendy) look too. I found the representations of both Kings Richard and John interesting, as they went against type -to a degree. Indeed, King John was a lot of fun. There were many faces to spot (I don't think its giving anything away to say that Max Von Sydow accepts that any role he takes involves him dying.), including some surprises and people going against type.

4194270,5,B003U0AHBO,"I had been following this films release for a long time, and remember really wanting to see it when it first came out.  I can't explain what a huge Robin Hood fan that I was as a kid.  I had the all green motif in my room until I was about 8.  I remember reading the Pyle version of the story, well before I was old enough to do so, but as the film approached release, due mostly to bad press, and a really bad trailer that came out right before release (note that trailers are not usually made by the actual film makers, so why people base their expectations on them, to include myself is beyond me.)  it was being marketed to a historically accurate version of Robin Hood.  How it could actually have happened, which is just another way of saying we b sed and speculated, kinda like that horrible clive owen version of king arthur.  Something in the vain of glaidiator but with robin hood, roll eyes.  This film is not that.  I missed the initial release and ended up seeing it for free in a second run theater, and I have to say that I was mesmorized.  It was really good. Not like best movie of the year good, but thoroughly entertaining, and it took some liberties that I was not expecting.  A lot of people say, oh great a sequel, some say there can't be a sequel of robin hood, because its an idea, a folklore, kind of like batman.  Different directors have focused on different parts of the mythology, because there are so many different sources to choose from.  I always thought that the Pyle version was the original book, but have subsequently found there are like at least 10 very different versions ranging from shakespeare, to Dumas, to Tolken C.S. Lewis Oxford alum, so with that in mind, this is its own telling.  In most original versions, Robin does his thing, as a commoner, becomes an outlaw to be pardoned by the king, go off to fight in the crusades, and come back to sherwood, maybe fight a last battle, and then die after defeating sherriff of nottingham. This film starts with robin as a soldier, who comes back after the war, trying to find the peace that has eluded him in life.  Will and Little John are other Veterans, and the saying that no one wants peace like a soldier holds true.  They fight for the people who couldn't go fight, and who can't stand up to the government.  There are various allusions to the current conflicts and low approvals of current policies.  While the story of robin may not be historically accurate, the way it is told is.  All the customs and set pieces are the most accurate representation of the time yet put on film, and it does stem from Ridly Scott's maticulous eye for historical detail.  This does lend itself to be a film for the whole family, and roots Robin's uprising on modern ideals and rebels agains English rule and oppression.  There is no King left to pardon robin in this.  The film's story doesn't travel as far as I would have liked, but it it definately a prequel, and since he ultimately must fail in liberating england, I think the subsequent sequels will be most interesting as robin's ideals, and his men's loyalties to them are questioned under the rule of king John.  I hope that more people get into this film, because I really thing that with writer Brian Hedgeland of LA Confidential and Mystic River Penning this series, the next film could be ever bit as good as the dark knight, though I'm afraid with the poor boxoffice it might never be.",1280880000,7,3432,4.440191387559809
4194271,5,B003U0AHBO,"It used to be the standard, in educating the young members of American or British societies, to talk about the Magna Carta as the root document for our idea of liberties.  We have gotten away from that because the Magna Carta applied only to a small number of people, and it was only over time that the class of people who enjoyed those liberties expanded.

Yet there is a great truth hidden in the old story, which this movie helps restore.  The late historian Sidney Painter wrote of how the Normans extended what had been the rights of ""vassals"" who served the king to all free men, as a means of avoiding revolts.  As the class of free persons grew during the Middle Ages, all who joined that class came to enjoy what had been (and remained, in other parts of Europe) the traditional rights of knights.

The history in this movie is imperfect, in order to tell that story in a way that is easier for a modern ear to hear.  Nevertheless, the movie is outstanding as an endorsement of ancient liberties in full voice.  Robin Hood, 'the common archer,' is elevated to knighthood by pretense and comes to be a defender of the idea that these basic rights should be enjoyed by all of humankind.  This movie does a great service by providing a aesthetic to go with these ancient notions of ""liberty by law,"" and helping to introduce modern viewers to the questions.  As with Braveheart -- another movie whose history was imperfect, and indeed far worse -- those engaged by the aesthetic will pursue these questions further, to our common profit.",1280361600,17,1543,4.581818181818182
4194272,5,B003U0AHBO,I loved this movie and I cannot wait to own it on DVD.  Russell C and Cate B are perfect and the supporting players were all great.  I liked the changes in the story.

4194284,4,B003U0AHBO,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I wasn't interested. I don't know -something about the grotesque violence, Russell Crowe (who I am not a fan of) and the apparent absence of Robin Hood's quintessential robbing from the rich and giving to the poor made me wonder how on earth this could even be a Robin Hood movie. But after some close friends kept raving about how much they enjoyed it, I thought I'd give the Crowe/Ridley Scott Gladiator team a try and I found that I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.

We meet the famous Robin Hood as a nothing archer in King Richard the Lionheart's army (known as Robin what-the-heck Longstride). After the king is killed in battle, Robin and his band of archer friends decide to disguise themselves as knights and travel back to England with news of the King's death. Before they can leave, though, a dying knight named Robert Loxely asks Robin to take his sword back to his father in Nottingham -Robin agrees. Once they arrive in England, John is crowned as king and Robin takes the sword to Loxley's father, who decides to pretend that Robin is his son returning from the Crusades. Not only does Robin suddenly finds himself a noble (and later a freedom fighter), but also the husband of Robert's wife, Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett).

The plot, once we get into it, is really interesting and well put-together, though with a few hiccups. The main issue I had was the lack of Robin stealing from the rich and giving to the poor -I know that seems so single-minded, but with a legend that's so embedded in our culture as doing these acts its so hard to think of him otherwise. I also kept in mind that this movie is meant to be an origin story and the entire thing does build up Robin's motivations for re-distributing wealth and develops interesting characters while setting the stage for Robin's future exploits.

Perhaps the easiest way for me to get over this is thinking of it as more of a medieval war movie than a Robin Hood movie. With this mentality, it's a well-done film, but with some violence that feels over-the-top and unneeded and may have gone on just a little too long. But honestly, I think this film doesn't get enough credit -you just have to get past the Robin Hood stereotype and be open to a different idea of the legend.",1276732800,25,2309,4.532374100719425
4194285,5,B003U0AHBO,"Not so great on historical fact, maybe, but what the heck. No storyteller of any age let literal truth get in the way of some healthy myth-making.

This is definitely a modern retelling, with a Cate Blanchett giving ballsier Marian than ever - and a great match to the current Robin. I don't know if Godfrey, this movie's mad guy, appears elsewhere in the Robin Hood canon either, but the political maneuverings added pressure that helped keep things moving.

Maybe purists won't like to see their beloved story adapted in any way. I found it a great bit of adventure, though, and an interesting take on the origin of Robin Hood. That movie ticket really earned its cost.

4194287,4,B003U0AHBO,"I went to see this movie with my dad, a huge Robin Hood fan (who's read way more on the subject than I will ever get around to doing).
The story opens with Robin Hood being a part of the army of King Richard the Lion Heart as they return to England from their exploits in the Crusade.  The King dies while sieging a castle.  Robin and his band (including Will and Little John) leave to return home.  They meet up with Robert Locksley, who was killed as he was trying to return the crown home to England to unworthy Prince John.  Robin takes a vow to return dying Robert's sword to his father in Nottingham...and thus begins a masquerade.
This is much different than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Prince-of-Thieves/dp/B002VWNID6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</a>.  It is more of a beginning story than in the midst of thieving Robin's exploits (and yes, it does set up for a possible sequel in which Robin can undermine the Sherriff of Nottingham).
The acting is absolutely brilliant.  Russell Crowe was a magnificent choice for Robin (even if he is Australian and not English), totally blowing my expectations.  His Robin was interesting and well-crafted: he is a soldier, he keeps his promises, he saves a woman's inheritances.  All in all, well done.  I loved Little John and the troup (they brought some laughs), but my most favorite was Cate Blanchett as Maid Marion.  WOW!  Cate made Marion fiesty, stubborn, but emotional and compassionate at the same time.  Watching Cate as Marion was a pleasure.  And I even enjoyed how Robin and Marion fell in love (the one with Costner made me cringe).
The action is well done.  It is a bit gruesome, so if you are squeamish, you've been warned.  I know one complaint my dad had and I share as well is that there wasn't much of Robin's infamous archery skills.  It is alluded to in the end, but it is what he is best known for and should probably have been seen more prominently.  Instead, we have a siege against a castle and a large fight between the English and the French on a beach.  Talk about water-logged.
The story is pretty interesting.  I thought it would be about Robin Hood at his height (when he was robbing and thieving), but instead, it is a ""prequel"" or ""beginning"" of sorts.  This was kinda disappointing, as it isn't what you expect going in, but I did like how it was different than most incarnations and the story of redemption, embracing the past, and heroism was unique.  The ending does set it up nicely for a sequel that will actually be Robin Hood (if they can get money for it).  At first, I thought it would be dorky for Robin to pretend to be Walter's long lost son, Robert, but it was pulled off really well.  I am sure there are anachronisms all over the place as well as medieval stereotypes (boiling oil and flaming arrows, anyone?), but I enjoyed this enough not to notice.
Would I recommend seeing it?  I had a really enjoyable time.  Maybe if you know too much about Robin Hood, it might not be the same, but I would at least give it a chance by watching or renting when it comes on DVD.

4194288,4,B003U0AHBO,"I went into this film with low expectations because I lacked real interest in the subject and knew of the mixed reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. That said, I can easily see why reviews are mixed; this is not the Robin Hood most expect or want. It is certainly far different from past Hollywood portrayals; perhaps it may even be said that this is a Robin Hood movie for those who do not like Robin Hood. Put simply, it is more serious and somewhat darker. The film is not tragic but has several tragic elements, and the tone is somber, while the humor that many will expect is rare and generally raunchy. Practically everything is different, from story to emphasis to presentation. Promotional material makes the story differences fairly clear. Those expecting repeated instances of ""stealing from the rich and giving to the poor"" will be disappointed; there is but one example, and several characters who usually figure largely - e.g., the Sheriff of Nottingham - have very minor roles. The film essentially focuses on what lead Robin to become the famous figure, which is in my view a wise move; the usual fare has after all been done enough - arguably almost ad nauseum - and could perhaps hardly be bettered. The fresh focus is appreciated and well-done; if director Ridley Scott's goal was putting his own proverbial stamp on a well-worn subject, he certainly succeeded. This not only means that many famous events are not shown or hardly present but also that the focus is sometimes not even on Robin specifically. The film is quasi-historical with substantial background detail. Those for whom such things are anathema will probably not like the film.

However, many others may. Anyone interested in medieval England will find much to appreciate; the movie gives a good idea of what the era was like, especially how people lived. Scott makes clear that it was a dark time; monarchs were oppressive, the church was corrupt, and the poor struggled just to survive. Whatever historical liberties he takes, he cannot be faulted for putting these fundamental elements across forcefully. Some credit must go to the fine cinematography, which breathtakingly conveys rural England's beauty; though not going for a historical film in the strict sense, Scott vividly shows the vast differences between today and a thousand years ago. The story encompasses a wealth of English history and folklore; the former is not always accurate, but we must again remember that this is not a historical film per se, and the quality here is well above comparable films'. Perhaps more importantly, history buffs will appreciate how well such elements are integrated, particularly as a high degree of plausibility is maintained, and there are very few anachronisms aside from the obvious one of speech. The script is admirable overall; though not high art, it is far above typical Hollywood fare, especially in the summer season. Drama and suspense are high; we are drawn in quickly and held tightly. There are unfortunately a few tired movie clichs, especially in the final battle, but the film is remarkably free of the hackneyed triteness that so plagues Hollywood. The love story thankfully does not proceed quite as one would expect and is unusually believable. A more controversial sticking point is the action; it seems that everyone thinks there is either too little or too much. There is a large amount, and it is unusually visceral for popular Robin depictions or summer blockbusters generally; however, it is so spread out that fairly long periods pass without it despite grand battles at the beginning and end. Anyone wanting a pure action movie will likely become impatient, while those seeking something more substantial may have the opposite feeling; to me, though, the balance is just about right.

I hesitate to divert fans from the film even with all these caveats, as many elements central to the legend's continuing popularity are here in profusion - not least the ever-invigorating good/evil dichotomy and the political and moral themes inherent to a serious treatment. More importantly, some parts of the film are so well-done that everyone can appreciate them, notably the acting. Occasionally questionable accent aside, Russell Crowe is the perfect Robin, mixing machismo with quiet wisdom and humble piety. Cate Blanchett's Marion is one of her better recent performances, and Mark Strong in his role as the devilish Godfrey continues to prove that he is one of Hollywood's best up and coming character actors. Oscar Isaac is at least as good as the thoroughly loathsome King John, and some of the smaller players - notably William Hurt as Marshal and Eileen Atkins as the king's mother - are also excellent. All told, I encourage everyone to forego expectations and take the film on its own terms; some may be disappointed, but perhaps at least as many will be pleasantly surprised.",1275696000,14,4897,5.014742014742015
4194289,3,B003U0AHBO,"From my wife Sarah: Some of the comments made by those who are enthusiastic about this movie are accurate in my opinion. However it didn't add up to a good movie. Yes, I can see that it's probably an accurate depiction of that time in history, and Russel Crowe is an amazing actor. Yet the movie was slow as molasses, and the many story lines difficult to understand and follow. We were really excited about seeing this. The team of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott (Gladiator) was intriguing. We found this movie very disappointing.

I love historical drama. I have no difficulty following period movies. Usually when others around me don't get what's going on in any type of movie, I'm the one who understands and explains. Yet I was completely confused at times. Finally towards the end I got what was going on, but this made the movie frustrating and boring for me. My husband doesn't usually prefer period movies, but since it was the story of Robin Hood and he's a big fan of Russel Crowe, he wanted to see it. He was completely lost during much of the story, and in fact fell asleep. Just to give you an idea of who's writing this review so you can judge if what I'm saying has validity, we're both college grads with masters level courses.

Russel Crow has a way of revealing so much from within as an actor that he's usually so compelling. It's easy to care about anyone he plays. However for some reason this was not the case in this movie. His character barely evoked any reaction. I suspect it wasn't his acting but the script, cutting and directing of the movie. Both Cate Blanchett and Russel Crowe have created passionate, big time chemistry relationships on screen. Yet the relationship between this Robin and Marion lacked chemistry. There was barely a match flame between them, which doesn't make for much an interesting romance story.

Interestingly, the fight scenes were shot and cut much the same as in Gladiator, but the excitement and thrill just didn't match Gladiator.

So if you really want to see this, my recommendation would be to rent it, but don't buy it or pay movie theater prices.",1275696000,2,2112,4.624
4194290,5,B003U0AHBO,"When you put Robin Hood & Russell Crowe in the same sentence, I'm there. Pleasantly surprised, since I had heard bad things. Maybe because, & I don't think I'm giving anything away here, this movie takes place before the Robin Hood legend we are used to. Also a good thing. There will be sequels I'm sure & let's get the prequel out of the way before Robin Hood II. In this version Robin fights with King John & that really doesn't sit well. We know that will change because King John at the end of the movie declares him & all his minions, outlaws. Crowe is great & never seems to have a bad performance. Cate Blanchette is classically beautiful as Marion, 12th century, landed gentry, who has had a hard life. Her man has been away at the crusades for 10 years. As history the whole thing is questionable. Historical events seem out of order to suit the plot. Richard the Lion-Hearted fares poorly. The sets were fantastic. As a producer Crowe insisted on shooting the movie where it occurred, in England, rather than eastern Europe, just to save $$. It shows he cares about this movie.",1275523200,9,1088,4.5

4194292,5,B003U0AHBO,"I like many aspects of this refreshingly earthy gritty variant of the various Robin Hood sagas. The motion and emotion are entrancing -- with some good humor to balance the many grim era-settings -- such as the Norman French ""landing-craft"" coming FROM Normandy for the last battle -- much like the ones that went TO there more recently [WW II]. The settings are very historically realistic Norman Medieval [including Celtic and Saxon aspects]. Being a longtime fan of the Middle Ages -- I am very pleasantly surprised at the many spot-on correct details. For example -- the realistic swords -- and swordplay with ""foul"" close-combat moves such as pommel-slams, head-butts, heel-trips and grappling -- much as in the Fectbuchs [""fight-books""] originating from Medieval experience. Then there's the pick-axes and bill-hooks used by calvary to remove footmen and vice versa. The staves, spears and lances drive home their points accurately. The longbows depicted are not fancy-fantasy ones -- but in their stark yew-wood reality. ""Robin Longstride"" [Russel Crowe] spent months learning about Robin Hood and his Norman Medieval setting -- and gained true skill with the longbow by-the-way. The siege equipment on both sides is quite real -- such as missle-weapons, shield-walls, hook-ladders, drop-stones, boil-pots and fire-bags. The other artifacts and usages such as tools, plows, and winches are spot-on. The castles and other dwellings are great in their lush greenwood settings. The production goes well into historical food, drink, manners and customs in those settings -- like the ring-dancing of Robin and Marion. The churches, castles, chapels, manors, houses and lands are incredibly historical -- as well as are the customs of the folks who live in these settings -- such as ""Lady Marion"" [Cate Blanchett] -- who gives a splendidly spirited presentation of the [eventual] partner of ""Robin Longstride"" -- these two leading a great number of excellent actors and acts to initiate the viewer into a graphic medieval expanded saga of Robin Longstride Hood.

4194293,3,B003U0AHBO,"In Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" the legend is given a new and updated backstory, which presumably took place prior to Robin's outlaw days in Sherwood Forest.  Whether the new backstory is was needed or not, I'm not sure. But on the other hand the nature of Robin Hood has always been to re-interpret and expand upon the legend....

Robin Hood has long been tied to King ""Richard the Lion Hearted"" as an ally of Richard's.  In the lastest ""Robin Hood,"" Robin is now specifically made a part of Richard's return from the Crusades, Richard's skirmishes in France, and King John's (who followed Richard) battles in fighting off a French invasion.  Robin is also given a possibly quirky or unexpected back-story of how he came to be known as `Robin of Locksley.""

The movie goes back and forth pretty well between decent drama and good action. Also, according to the History Channel Show ""The Real Robin Hood,"" attention in the movie is paid to authentic battle mail, costumes, weapons, and battle techniques of the period. The movie features overall solid performances from Crowe and Blanchett; and the supporting roles include William Hurt and the legendary Max Von Sadow.  Although it's a new take on the Robin Hood legend it's not necessarily a strikingly original movie - it's a bit of a mix-mash of movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, and others and features one dimensional villains - but that's not always a bad thing at the movies!  The latest incarnation of ""Robin Hood"" may not be an absolute ""must-see"" but it's entertaining and if you're in the mood for kings, knights, battles, and tales from ""jolly ole- England"" it's worth at the very least a rental.",1275264000,3,1659,4.840989399293286
4194294,1,B003U0AHBO,"Mr Scott had a legendary hero, a top box office star and a lot of money. With these ingredients he must have done a good film, or at least a competent one. But somewhere in the middle of the recipe our Ridley  lost it.
Where is the Ridley that  amazed me in The duelist or scared me in Alien? Maybe like our hero he is lost in the woods. I must confess that I think Galdiator is  a mess and Kingdom of Heavens a mistake, but at least in them there was a story being told. This robin Hood is nothing but scene after scene. Nothing to fix them together. Maybe he wanted to tell a lot of things and he did not have the time? Don't answer that was a rethorical question.

So our  very masculine and rough Robin was actually a Longstride fighting for king and country, when suddenly he becomes involved in a conspiracy fulled by those bad Frenchies. How so you wonder? hey Mr Scott  just let him passing by and voila. Because he is not only rough and masculine but also compassionate  in his way home he finds Sir Robert Loxley, mortally wounded . The  poor man asks him to carry a sword , his sword to his father in England . So there he goes. Arriving to Nottingham he  finds out  several things:
- Loxley's widow has  guts
- Loxley's father has ideas
- Loxley's lands are in a brink to be lost.
He was just passing by, again, to give back the sword  but the old Loxley  has an idea, and the lands can be lost and did I say Marian had guts?. So he stays there pretending to be Robert Loxley.
And the Frenchies? And the conspiracy? and for heavens sake! Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham?. Well there are around, somewhere. Talking in pedantic ways to say nothing- Oh and we even have William Marshall.
So you guess the rest. Bad guys attack villagers, Robin fights them. Marian is in distress but because she has you know what she fights back. But wait there is more. The French are invading (you forgot the conspiracy eh?), Marshall and the barons hate John. Robin fights in the beaches, Marian fights in the beaches. They win , John loses and have to sign a paper. But we only have five minutes to end the film and he is not stealing the rich and giving it to the poors! Wait, the solution is here. Prince john, well actually king but if Ridley does not care about about accuracy why we?. So John declares him an outlaw, they go to the woods and live happily ever after.
Well , this is it. Ridley Scott has killed all the heroism, adventure, romance and familiarity of our dead fellow with the hood pretending he wanted to do a new approach to an old legend. Unfortunately he was not not up to the task. I have always knew he has never been good in the romantic part as a director but honestly , where is the adventure? Shooting scens with a lot of people shoiting and horses riding  does not mean they are action but a lot of people in movement. So Le debacle has finally reached Mr Scott and we, the poor audience can only hope that  Mr Scott's next project  would be shooting an ad.",1274918400,22,2992,4.231985940246045

4194296,4,B003U0AHBO,"This version of Robin Hood is all that a film should be; entertaining, gripping, spectacular, well acted, memorable.  I thoroughly enjoyed this  Robin Hood, though I went to the cinema expecting to watch another version of the  familiar tale. I was pleasantly surprised by this interpretation of historical events which veer from the legend and take a more realistic approach as to what may have occurred.

Robin is not the young, robust warrior but a mature seasoned fighter who is forced by circumstances to take on the identity of Robert of Loxley who has been ambushed and killed by the traitor Godfrey, who is plotting against the English King. Robin reaches the scene of ambush in time to chase the traitor off, but not in time to save Loxley, who begs him to return his sword to his aged father in Nottingham.

Once he arrives in Nottingham he faces the plight of the people who are impoverished due to the insupportable levies imposed by the king.  Their fate is further encumbered by the lack of younger men able to work in the fields, as they have all gone to war with king Richard the Lionheart.  Now King Richard is dead and his younger brother has succeeded him to the throne.  This vain man trusts the traitor Godfrey as his advisor but Godfrey is actually plotting against him.  His violent and bloodthirsty methods of extracting taxes turn the nobles to revolt against their king.  In the meantime, Godfrey conspires with the Frech king to invade England which is in the throes of a civil war. This is the turbulent political situation Robin faces as he arrives in Nottingham.  Sir Loxley, Robert's aged father, begs Robin to remain in Nottingham as his son as there is no one to defend his keep. His daughter in law, Marion (who is neither young nor a maid) is in need of protection now that her husband is dead.  Robin accepts and brings joy and prosperity back to a stuggling estate. However, Godfrey who had killed Loxley, wants Robin dead and his thugs are spreading terror and destruction to everyone who puts up any resistance.

It's all there.  The great actors, (Crowe, Blanchett, von Sydow), the impressive war scenes, the realistic depiction of an era, the evil heroes hatching plots and the greater than life heroes with mettle fighting to death to defend all that humans hold dear.  A truly fascinating film which never lags and it is with relief and anticipation that we realize at the end that a sequel will follow as this film is a prelude as to why Robin became an outlaw. I am looking forward to part ii.",1274659200,16,2538,4.646532438478747
4194297,5,B003U0AHBO,"The film is not only dealing with Robin Hood, the famous and mysterious character of English history and the Forest of Sherwood. It is a lot more, a film on the tricky period when Richard Lionheart coming back from his crusade is killed in a battle in France. This time when John Lackland is taking over and has to face the attempt to invade England performed by the French king Philip II Augustus. The invasion was prepared by a treacherous friend of King John who tried to use his friendship to serve the interests of the French king. He submitted the northern part of the country to heavy taxes and a lot of violence that caused their rebellion against the king, which should have enabled the French fleet to disembark and conquer London. The film is essentially an adventure film but it is also based on history and it respects that history. The way the King manipulates the rebellious barons to get their help in time to defeat the French on his own beaches is the perfect case of a liar that uses the belief in divine kings of the time only to seize more power and deprive others from any small piece of it. We know it will take fifteen to sixteen years for an alliance to be built between the barons, the church and the merchants of the City of London to force that king John to come to Runnymede and accept to sign the Magna Carta that will change the world, that represents the first step of that vast historical change that we call democracy. Fifteen small years in the heart of feudalism to achieve that phenomenal transformation. And that Magna Carta is so small when measured with our own values that we are amazed by the infinitely small in history. Robin Hood, who is not yet Robin Hood, since the film ends when Robin Longstride is outlawed by John Lackland, is thus only one small man among these men, and women, who made history then, or started to make history, though it seems fairer to say that they were those who finally brought England in the wake of the slowly moving boat of history. This action film only becomes that historical film I am speaking of if you know all these details of English history. Otherwise it will remain an action film. Ridley Scott just did a good film in both directions.

4194298,5,B003U0AHBO,"I really enjoyed this movie--lots of action and excellent performances by Russell Crowe (Robin), as well as Cate Blanchette (Lady Marian), Max Von Sydow (Daddy Loxley), William Hurt (Court Chancellor), and Mark Strong (Godfrey).  Based on how the movie ends, a part 2 could easily follow, but understand that this movie stands on its own as it is.  Most of you already know the basic story of Robin Hood.

It is turn-of-the-12th Century England.  The law of the land is oppressive to the people.  They are poor and hungry and overtaxed already from the long wars.  Beloved King Richard has been away in the Crusades for the last 10 years and is now making his way back to England.  It is 1199 and he is fighting his final battle in France.  Back in London, Richard's younger brother John is having a good old time being a spoiled nasty little creep. In France, Philip is plotting with Godfrey to kill Richard on his way back.  (Godfrey is like a double agent in a James Bond movie.  He is pretending to work for John but is really in cahoots with Philip.)

Robin of Loxley and King Richard are good friends and fighting side-by-side.  Robin Longstride/later known as Robin Hood (Russell Crowe) is also fighting with the same group, but not a friend of the King's.  When Richard appears to have been killed in the battle and Robert/Robin Loxley is ambushed by French bandits (hired by Geoffrey), Robin Hood comes upon the remnants of the ambush.  Loxley asks Hood to take his sword back to his dad in Nottingham.  Robin Hood also assumes his identity and travels back as Loxley, joined by 3 friends/fighting companions (one being Little John).  Thinking that Richard is dead, Momma crowns her remaining son as king, the arrogant John and let's just say that John is NOT a people person.

Friar Tuck is a cute little round friar who is also a Bee-Keeper and makes some kind of moonshine with the honey.  Daddy Loxley owns 5000 acres of land.  He is blind so his daughter-in-law, Lady Marian, takes care of him and helps with the land.  (Daddy Loxley is played by Max Von Sydow, one of my absolutely favorite actors.  I guess Max must be 80 something by now.)  Daddy Loxley takes a liking to Robin and asks him to stay.  Meanwhile, Godfrey and the French army are murdering and burning everywhere they go, in the name of King John.

It is an excellent movie and full of action and beautiful scenery.  Although the credits did not say where it was filmed, during the moving they were indicating the scenery was between France and England.  The movie is a Marine's dream, full of hand-to-hand combat.  The movie also takes place before Robin Hood was declared an outlaw, providing the events that led up to the legend, that's why I think there will be a part 2.

Enjoyable movie, lots of action, and time passed by quickly.",1274486400,5,2818,4.604417670682731
4194299,5,B003U0AHBO,"""Robin Hood"" is great! This is how the story goes: In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.

""Robin Hood"" chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard's army against the French. Upon Richard's death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion, a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff.

With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more.

The costume design by Janty Yates (who also did the costume design to ""Gladiator"", ""Hannibal"", ""Kingdom Of Heaven"", ""Miami Vice"" (2006), ""American Gangster"" & ""Body Of Lies"") is great!

This is a great action drama that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is better than most recent summmer films this year, so far. This is another great hit from Ridley Scott & Russell Crowe.",1274486400,7,5845,5.034090909090909
4194300,4,B003U0AHBO,"The life of Robin Hood is, of course, a vague legend.  It concerns an outlawed man who fights for the downtrodden in England's midlands in the 13th century.  It is a story that has been reworked many times both on television and in film.  In this case, we have Ridley Scott reprising the story with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles as Robin and Marion.

The plot used for this film is arguably implausible.  Robin has returned from the Crusades (scarcely one of Christendom's high points) and passes himself off as a man of wealth in Nottingham.  He sees the injustice of King John and his heavy handed taxes.  In due course, he is forced to be an outlaw and, thus, the legend is born.

Crowe and Blanchett are good in their respective roles.  However, it is the grandeur and scale of the scenes that really capture the viewer's attention.  These are truly magnificent.  Yet what really excels is the grittiness of the scenes.  The castles seem dirty but very believable.  There are no Disney type scenes here.  Ridley Scott has managed to capture the times well.  All too often, films of the middle ages are simply too clean.  Here, ""Robin Hood"" has cred.

So, how to sum up?  Well, it a good film without being a great film.  Two hours well spent.",1274486400,5,1271,4.54424778761062
4194301,4,B003U0AHBO,"Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have now done four movies together, the most notable of which is undoubtedly Gladiator, a fantastic story, and a brilliantly realised movie in the tradition of Braveheart.

With Robin Hood director and actor would  face a story and a character, portrayed many times in movies and tv series. Robin Hood has been played by actors as diverse as Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Patrick Bergin and Errol Flynn. Even Mel Brooks did a series Robin Hood Men in tights.

Inevitably, if you are like me, you will make comparisons with your other experiences of Robin Hood.  Bravely, it attempts to tell the story in a fresh and invigorating way, exploring the story before the story you already know.

Firstly, in this story Robin Hood is not yet Robin Hood, but Robin Longstride, a man of uncertain origin and we suspect less than noble birth, and we meet him on the battlefields of France, fighting the cause of King Richard. Robin calls out the King's reckless crusade, and Robin and his three friends end up in the stocks, and so the adventure begins.

Eventually, Robin and his men escape, and Robin assumes the identity of a dying nobleman, and agrees to carry out his last wish, which leads him to  Lady Marion.

Usually King Richard plays as a heroic character still abroad, and Prince John remains a scheming prince.  Here however John becomes the King, and undergoes somewhat of an unlikely transformation from weakling mamas boy Prince to tyrant King.

This presents a dilemma in accepting the story as given.  Sometimes while watching this movie, particuarly action scenes you may feel like you are watching Braveheart or Gladiator.

Apparently, Russell Crowe walked out of a BBC radio interview, when the British presenter, suggested his accent was Irish not English, Russell responding bollocks, and telling 'you got dead ears, mate.  You got to love Russell.

Being Irish myself, I did think there was one scene where he had a slight lilt, other than that I found nothing wrong with the accent.  In any event, I don't think Sean Connery has ever done anything other than a Scottish accent, even when he won the Academy Award playing an Irish policeman with a Scottish accent.

So, I rate this movie three and a half stars.  I think you will enjoy it, without necessarily being wowed.  If the story elements had been more consistent with other versions I definitely would have enjoyed it more.

What I liked most about this movie was him releasing the arrow in slow motion with drops of water flying off, and I also like the Little John character, who you may recognise as a villain from Lost.

I hope you found this review helpful.",1274227200,8,2664,4.775109170305677
4194302,5,B003U0AHBO,"I adored this movie.  Not only did it give some humor, action, and what not- but it also gave a much more realistic and historic view of the famous Robin Hood.

I was watching the History channel the night before we went to see this movie in the theaters.  I think it gave the movie sort of a prequel of what to expect along with actual historical information- whether it was on the kings, Robin Hood himself, or the weapons used.  The amount of detail that went into the movie to make sure it was as historically accurate as possible was amazing.  The construction of the bows, the shields and weapons used (my favorite part was the war hammer that Robin used near the end!) and the horses.

If you aren't interested in the historical part of RH and would rather see tons of explosions and what not- this movie may not be for you.  If you are interested in a more realistic/historic tale of Robin Hood- then I think you'll enjoy this piece.

Check out the History channel's special on Robin Hood- [...]  I think you'll come to find how amazing this movie is along with the amount of detail that was put into the weaponry and other items in the movie.",1274227200,134,1151,4.366197183098592
4194303,2,B003U0AHBO,"The only other Robin Hood movie I've ever seen was the parody directed by Mel Brooks. I couldn't compare it to the previous films, but I understand this is a retelling of how Robin came to be who he was. It feels like an epic film, but it was very boring and drags on a few scenes. There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham. At first, Lady Marion doesn't trust Robin, but she soon warms up to him. If you are a hardcore English folklore fan, then you'll probably love ROBIN HOOD!!!",1274140800,,670,4.411290322580645
4194304,4,B003U0AHBO,"This movie was pretty fantastic. I'll go ahead and get the Gladiator comparison out of the way though. Gladiator is one of my all time favorite films. I give it a 10 out of 10. This movie I give a solid 8 out of 10.

To shrug this off as another ""Robin Hood"" movie would be oversight. This movie is not about Robin Hood but is instead about Robin Longstride and how this Robin Longstride becomes Robin Hood. It starts with Robin Longstride in one of the last battles of the crusades. After King Richard is killed, Robin Longstride and a few friends escape and assume the identity of some ambushed knights, one of which is Robert Loxley, to win passage home. Robin decides to fulfill Robert Loxley's dieing wish and returns his sword to his father who lives in Nottingham. Through all of this, Robin Longstride ends up getting pulled into defending Nottingham from a treasonous English Knight, Sir Godfrey, and eventually joins in the fight saving England from an invading France. The movie closes leaving Robin and Marion living in the Sherwood Forest and becoming Robin Hood.

The acting was superb. Russel Crowe was flawless as always. Cate Blanchett as Marion, Max Von Sydow as Sir Walter, Mark Strong as Godfrey, Oscar Isaac as Prince John, and Kevin Durand as Little John all did an amazing job. There weren't any moments where the acting made you shudder and overall I thought the acting was just superb.

The movie did drag on in the beginning parts but the writers/producers did a good job of mixing in action here and there to get you through the slow parts. The background of Robin Longstride was perhaps the weakest part of the movie. It was the classic ""I'm an orphan and I hate my father because he abandoned me..oh wait He was a Hero and he was killed he didn't abandon me after all..I have a reason to live yay!!"". Ridley Scott did it well, don't get me wrong, but that formula has become a little old these days IMO. However, the story keeps you interested and overall was put together very well.

All in all this movie is definitely worth watching. For me (granted I am a huge Russel Crowe fan) this movie will be a day one purchase on Blu-Ray. I suggest everyone see this movie that likes Russel Crowe as an actor or enjoys a well thought out and put together action film.",1274140800,12,2290,4.524154589371981

Hated it.

It was avery badly written.

It was extremly dull.

There was nothing of interest.

Although it was a origin story robin hood was in his forties and had an irish accent!!

Exlamation points!!

No escape.

My work paid for it, I had to sit through it with my team.

I left and snuck into Iron Man 2 for 10 minutes.

When I returned I reclined the chair I was in (fancy cinema) and listened to ""lacuna coil"" on my mp3 player.

I could not endure even to hear the stiltet dialogue and cheesy dialogue.

4194306,5,B003U0AHBO,"As an alternative vision of the Robin Hood story, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It isn't perfect but is great entertainment.  The writers and directors have done an excellent job of reproducing a thirteenth century world.  The barons live under conditions not far removed from their serfs.  Everybody is unwashed and filthy and the floors of the liege halls are covered in old straw.  A bath is a splash of water and people sleep with their hunting dogs.

I especially enjoyed 'Maid' Marion as an older woman who, like Penelope of Ithaca, has remained faithful to her war-lost husband for 10 long years.  She is one of the true heroes of the story, strong and noble at the same time.  Still, the writers tried to get it right.  Despite the fact that she lives a life not far removed from her 'subjects', she is still a noble.  Relations with a commoner--even a brave, attractive and noble commoner--approaches social and personal impossibility.

Warfare is brutal and even our 'Robin Hood' character admits to an act of incredible evil.  Three thousand Muslims were slaughtered at Acre and our hero followed his King's orders and slaughtered a young woman at his feet.  Our man detests both himself and his King for what was done, tells him about it and....

I also enjoyed the way the writers and directors developed the character of the initially juvenile and spoiled Prince John.  He matures but the film goes back on itself and ends rather weakly.  I understand this, because the producers hope for a sequel, but it doesn't help the quality of the present film.

Politically, the film is fascinating.  The Robin Hood story has always had heavy political and egalitarian overtones.  This film emphasizes it more than most Robin Hood stories.  Not once do we hear reference to the old Saxon-Norman rift.  It is a story of the power of the king against lesser men.  As such--despite the fact that the writers may not have intended it--there is much for worried constitutionalists to celebrate about this film.  Central governmental power is shown in a negative--even evil--light.  Yeah.....",1274054400,16,2094,4.8835227272727275

I think they should have stuck with the original title of the film ""Nottingham"" or even ""Robin of Locksley"" then made a sequel called Robin Hood. Some people probably complained about how Robin was a commoner in this film and not the aristocrat that everyone knows him as, but he was actually a commoner in the earliest versions of the story. I hope they release a directors cut like Kingdom of Heaven that made the theatrical version of the film look like crap and a sequel film with Crow actually being Robin Hood.",1274054400,38,622,4.417391304347826

""The first thing to know about director Ridley Scott's and actor Russell Crowe's ""Robin Hood"" is that this is not a ""Robin Hood"" movie.
This is a Robin Longstride movie.
This story happens before all of the action and people you know and love from many previous tellings. Robin Longstride is not yet an outlaw known as Robin the Hood or Robin Hood; Marion is not a maid; there's no taking from the rich and giving to the poor; the merry men have yet to band.""

Going into this I didn't know that info.. kinda wish I had, and a little confused why they didn't try to work that info into the title somehow -- even though the battles are epic and the presentation is beyond impressive I kept wondering -- why am I watching a movie about France and England at war? There's a reason. They are showing HOW Robin Longstride (Hood) became the wanted man I was waiting 140 minutes for him to be. I cannot hold ambition against a movie filled with great acting and production values -- still, I feel a little cheated.

4194312,5,B003U0AHBO,"The story of Robin Hood has been told in films with different plot twists. In Douglas Fairbanks' version from 1922, Robin Hood is the Earl of Huntington, going off on Crusade with King Richard (played by Wallace Berry).  Huntington returns to oppose Prince John, who is threatening to take the throne from his brother.

Errol Flynn's version has Robin Hood staying in England as a Saxon nobleman opposing Prince John for the same reasons as Douglas Fairbanks' Huntington.  Kevin Costner keeps the Third Crusade in the story but adds a Muslim warrior played by Morgan Freeman.  There are many approaches to telling the story of Robin Hood.

Ridley Scott's version is perhaps the most ambitious.  The film begins with Richard the Lion Heart's siege of the Castle Chaulus Chabral in Normandy.  This is where we meet Robin Longstride, a skilled archer, who has followed King Richard into battle for many years.  The king looks for an honest man and is confronted with Longstride who has been running a game of chance and is accused (by Little John) of cheating.  Robin is not cheating but, ironically, his honest answers to the king land him and his companions shackled.  So much for honesty and kings.

The death of King Richard allows Robin and his companions to escape and flee back home.  Along the way, they run across a party led by Robert Loxley retuning the crown back to England.  Loxley has been attacked by an English nobleman named Godfrey (magnificently played by Mark Strong) who is conspiring with King Philip of France to invade England.  Loxley is mortally wounded but Robin and his companions rout Godfrey and his men.  The dying Loxley asks Robin to return his sword to his father.  Not being a nobleman, Robin impersonates Loxley and returns the crown to the hands to Prince John.

The story develops with Robin and his men going to Nottingham where Robin is, conveniently, asked by Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) to pretend to be his son in order to preserve the household for his daughter-in-law Marion (Cate Blanchett).  The story centers on stopping Godfry and the intended invasion of England by King Philip.  A sub-plot concerns the rights of Englishmen centered on a documents of rights that Robin's father (long ago executed) was instrumental in conceiving. The document is the Magna Carta in all but name.

This Robin Hood brings the 12th century to life in all of its grim realities of hard work and, by our standards, hard living.  The production design is beautifully conceived, down to the rushes strewn on the floor of the manor house.  The performances are magnificent down to supporting roles. It was nice to see Mark Addy (of The Full Monty) as Friar Tuck and Oscar Isaac made an effective quarrelsome King John.  John Hurt has a strong role as William Marshall, a courtier of King Richard, and Eileen Atkins made a strong Queen Eleanor.  Danny Huston made an exciting Richard the Lion Heart.

The film ends with Robin declared an outlaw for supporting the rights of Englishmen.  The film ends where Errol Flynn's version begins.  I have not heard if Ridley Scott intends to take up the story but we are left in anticipation of what is to come.  This Robin Hood is well acted and beautifully photographed. The story is refreshingly different from the other Robin Hood's but it is a story that has differed from film to film and television.",1274054400,195,3375,4.7923875432525955
4194313,5,B003U0AHBO,First of all this is NOT a kid's version of Robin Hood. This version tells the story of the origins of the legend. This is a very violent movie with numerous casualties. I will not go into too many details so I won't ruin the plot. Needless to say people should visit[...]  and look up the crusades so they would be able to follow the story easier. Parents should see this movie before considering taking minor children under the age of 13 to go see it due to the violence and they might not be able to follow the history behind the story.

But today I went to go see the movie, especially after months of hype; it was directed by Ridley Scott and had Russell Crowe, and it was the long awaited Robin Hood. When I saw the ad with on the Superbowl, I got all hyped up and excited. It looked like it was going to be an awesome reimagining of an epic.

Instead... we got basically a very derivative and boring movie about some emo dude named Robin Hood. That's basically about it.

First off, WHERE IS ROBIN HOOD??? Robin Hood should be fun, adventurous, he's basically the James Bond of the 12th century. Prince of Thieves did a way better job at portraying the character. Instead we get a whiny and angsty emo guy named Robin Hood who grumbles his way through the movie.

Second, there's way too much going on. There's at least 30 different story lines, like... well, the king dies, the new King John has been appointed the throne, Robin has managed to flee back to England, the French are planning an invasion, etc. Yawn. There's so much going that it's hard to keep track of what goes on. Too many subplots, too many characters, etc.

Also, the movie is very derivative. Let's see: Where did the landing on the beach towards the end as well as the battle come from? Oh that's right! Saving Private Ryan. Where did all those pre-battle ""speeches"" come from? Oh that's right! Braveheart. Where did the so-called Robin come from? Oh that's right! Gladiator! Huzzah for recycling!!! Cause after all, movies are environmentally friendly too!

The action scenes were very poorly done. It seems like Scott went to the team: ""Oh yeah, so ya know. Shake the camera, splash water everywhere, throw some fake blood everywhere, have people jump around clanging their swords, and stuff like that."" ""Cool, nobody can see what's going on!""

Most importantly, the movie was just plain... too long. I have indeed seen longer movies but seriously, this is just long. At least 30 minutes should be trimmed. There are tons of scenes that don't have anything to do with the plot and even more importantly, too many subplots and characters, half of which could be cut, and the end, the movie is just forgettable to the point where you won't even remember how the movie opens.

In short, this movie was an utter disaster on Scott's part, and was in general, frustrating to watch. I still can't get over how frustrating it was.",1273881600,7,2525,4.620535714285714
4194316,1,B003U0AHBO,"No character development, no decent plots, just a boring movie. I fell asleep twice during fight scenes. This movie had good actors, but a really boring script and plot.... Don't waste your money... I haven't seen a movie this bad since 9th gate, and honestly I'd rather see that again than be forced to watch Robin Hood again.",1273881600,18,327,4.655172413793103
4194317,5,B003U0AHBO,"This movie is an excellent rendition of Robin Hood. Russell Crowe is excellent as his usual rugged, stoic, tough guy image. The story line is quite different yet shows a truer picture of 12th century existence. When comparing this to previous iterations of the story, keep in mind the time period/ story of this movie predates more familiar versions.

 When this movie is released on DVD it will take its place alongside other Russell Crowe classics that have become favorites: Gladiator and Master & Commander. Robin Hood sits comfortably alongside those classics as films well worth watching.",1273881600,16,594,5.11340206185567
4194318,3,B003U0AHBO,"I'm all for them making Robin Hood into a more realistic hero, but this movie felt more like a combination of Braveheart and Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven (both vastly superior films). While watching it today, I couldn't help but feel bored. I'm a fan of the director, Ridley Scott, but he needs to stop with these historical epics. He is suppose to be making a prequel to his first big hit, Alien, in the future, so that's good news.

Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett are good here and elevate the material. Mark Strong adds another memorable villain to his resume. Over the last six months or so, this dude has been the lead bad guy in three movies. This is probably his best work in the realm of evil, followed by Kick-Ass and then Sherlock Holmes. William Hurt shows up for a paycheck, but Max von Sydow's character is very warm and makes you care about him, even in a small role like the one he is given here.

The fight scenes and music score are decent, nothing worth remembering. The PG-13 rating hurt the realism a bit, with not much blood to be seen, but it is still plenty violent in it's own right. I do have to say that the costumes and sets are top notch.

The funny thing is, the last five minutes is when I began to really get into it. The whole outlaw part had just begun as Robin retreats to the forest. If they cut out an hour from earlier on and added in this aspect, I think it would have been much better. Maybe they are planning a sequel to tell that side of the story. That's the steal from the rich and give to the poor Robin Hood I want to see.

If historical epics are your thing, this deserves a Blu-ray rental. It's pretty mediocre, which proves that one of the greatest marksman when it comes to directing, Ridley Scott, can't always hit the mark.",1273881600,8,1780,4.304477611940299
4194319,5,B003U0AHBO,"As a scholar of the Middle Ages I can say you're not likely to see a better re-creation of the era of King John than any random frame you might pick from Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. From Celtic monuments to Roman ruins, to Loxley hall abundant with 12th century furnishings this film is breathtaking and superbly researched. Except perhaps for the huts clustered around London Tower-- the castle was in the midst of a city long before AD 1199. But real huts may be preferable to digital animation.
The authors know English history and the Robin Hood material and play fast and loose with both -- which is being true to the tradition of Mallory,Shakespeare, and the Victorian versions of the tale that nowadays seem to be taken for Robin Hood gospel. In a merry spirit of throwing a bit of everything into this script, we are being treated to  glimpses of the masked Dying God in the forest (see archeologist Margaret Murray's The God of the Witches for what that's all about.) The Magna Carta -- complete with authentic signatures of the 1215 version and Matthew Paris's illustrations of shields from forty years later -- makes a premature appearance twice. And the royal favorite turns out to be an agent working for the unpopularity of the king to make way for an invasion from France -- a plot twist borrowed from the time of Richard III (don't trust Shakespeare for this, see Paul Murray Kendall's definitive Richard III.) But, hey, Walter Scott combines three centuries in the opening paragraphs of Ivanhoe, why can't Ridley Scott? I give this film five stars, it is stunningly produced, persuasively acted, and keeps up the long tradition of anchronism in Robin Hood plots.",1273795200,450,1678,4.786206896551724
4194320,3,B003U0AHBO,"This isn't your grandfather's ""Robin Hood,"" which in this case is neither a compliment nor a criticism. It's just what is. Director Ridley Scott makes no attempt to romanticize the legend, probably because we've seen that take on it so many times before. And why not? The Robin Hood we've heard about makes for a wonderful story - he's handsome, strong, daring, moral, and radically philanthropic, having robbed from the rich to give to the poor. He's the perfect hero, a figure that can inspire desire and idolization even in children. As far as I'm concerned, it makes perfect sense that he's been the star of so many film adaptations. We like heroes, especially when they stand for something that I'm assuming most of us believe in.

We don't really get that from this new Robin Hood, here surnamed Longstride and played competently but not exactly memorably by Scott regular Russell Crowe. While he has very definite ideas about how people should be treated in general, he's not a selfless defender of the people so much as a common soldier, an archer, serving his king. He has been fighting abroad in the Third Crusade for the last ten years, but after Richard the Lionheart dies in battle, he decides that it's time to return to England. Three other soldiers - Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle), and the Little John (Kevin Durand) - tag along, perhaps because Scott know that it wouldn't be ""Robin Hood"" if these characters weren't included. When Robin comes across a dying knight, named Robert Loxley, he solemnly promises to return a sword to his father.

For reasons passing understanding, Robin assumes Loxley's identity upon returning to England, where he must deliver the bad news that the King is dead and see the crown passed on to Richard's younger brother, John (Oscar Isaac), portrayed as an arrogant fool who imposes harsh taxes on his kingdom. His right hand man is the evil Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), who, because of his heritage, has his own sinister plans for the future of England. What is poor King John to do but make those beneath him suffer, especially when he knows that his kingship was a gift given to him by God?

Robin and his men travel to the village of Nottingham, where the blind elder Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) decides it would be financially beneficial for Robin to continue posing as his dead son. Here enters Loxley's widow, Lady Marian (Cate Blanchett), a strong-willed and cunning woman who will inevitably become Robin's love interest, despite her efforts to resist him. I might have bought into this medieval romance had it not been so obviously constructed. Consider a scene in which Robin is preparing for a bath; when only Marian is around, he calmly tells her that he needs help undoing his chainmail armor. Nothing immediately comes of this, but the implications are none too subtle. And then there's the scene of them sharing the same bedroom; Marian threatens to cut off ... a very sensitive part of Robin's anatomy if he even tries to go near her. Given this confrontational viewpoint, how can she not eventually end up loving him? There's a reason we have phrases like, ""Opposites attract.""

There's no denying that this movie is well made from a technical standpoint. John Mathison's cinematography and Arthur Max's production designs are astonishing, evoking not an idealized storybook world of feathered caps and merry men but the dark, gritty reality of the Middle Ages, where soldiers were caked with dirt and cottages were infested with rats. There's also an impressive array of visual effects, although I suspect they were diminished by the film's PG-13 rating, especially during the violent battle scenes. Scott has made a name for himself as a visual director, something I've never objected to except when it comes at the expense of great performances and fully developed screenplays. ""Robin Hood,"" while efficiently told, doesn't aspire to be anything more than a great-looking historical epic. It has a lot of style, but when it comes to substance, something is lacking.

Maybe that something is originality. Even with the names and locations associated with ""Robin Hood,"" this movie is fairly generic, offering little that hasn't already been offered in other recent medieval stories. Robin could have gone by Sir Michael and Nottingham could have been called Green Meadows - the effect would have been exactly the same. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that it reinterprets the Robin Hood legend, relying a little more on history than on the excitement of a swashbuckling adventure. I won't say that this is a devastating failure for Ridley Scott, but I will say that he could have done better. Given his reputation for rereleasing his films in expanded and/or alternate cuts (""Blade Runner,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" ""Legend""), perhaps the best version of ""Robin Hood"" is yet to come. One can only hope.",1273795200,6,4906,4.913148371531967
