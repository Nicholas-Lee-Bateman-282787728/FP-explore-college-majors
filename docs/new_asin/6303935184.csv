736051,3,6303935184,"This film has so many versions that it's hard to say which one you will get.  The original is quite spicy with several nude scenes of Hedy Geisler (Hedy Lamar).  The sound track is primitive with just a little dialog or,  depending on which cut, no dialog.  This film was made just into the sound  era in Chechoslovakia.  As a collectors' item, it is a must for classic  film buffs, not for its quality or filmaking technique but for its impact  on movie censorship in the US.  The theme here is adultry.  Hedy plays a  young new wife to an older cold fish.  Fustrated on her wedding night, she  embarks on various endeavors clearly motivated by sexual fustration.  The  nude swim after a horseback ride is what all the hoopla was about.  The  horse runs away carrying our girl's clothes.  From this point on, various  versions carry various degrees of Hedy depending on which cut you get.  I  have 2, one purchased commercially in 1975 and another obtained later from  a private collector.  The second has much more nudity than the first.  While hiding in the woods, Hedy meets a young surveyor and a liason  blossoms.  You'll have to buy the film to find out what happens.  I would  buy this film, especially if you haven't seen it.

Lush and psychologically vivid music recalling Richard Strauss's operas.  Even the very sparse dialogue is essentially unnecessary.

736153,3,6303935184,"Pope Pius XII publically denounced it.  The Legion of Decency condemned it.  The United States banned it from importation.  It is easily one of the great scandals in cinema history: the 1933 ECSTASY.

An Austrian film directed by Gustav Machaty, ECSTASY is the story of Eve (Hedy Lamarr, billed here as Hedy Kiesler), who marries an older man named Emile (Zvonimir Rogoz.)  After several days of inattention and disappointment, Eve returns to her father's home.  One morning she goes for a naked swim--but her horse runs away with her clothes.  Adam (Aribert Mog) comes to the rescue, and although Eve is angry that he has seen her naked, she can't stop thinking about him.  Later that evening she goes to his cabin, where she enjoys his embrace.  But unfortunately for all concerned, Emile has come in search of Eve, determined to take her home.

The film is done in a deliberately arty style.  When Emile takes Eve for their honeymoon, for example, he has a tremendous problem getting the his key in the door lock--a bit of obvious imagery that does not portend well for the marriage.  Later in the film Eve's pearls become yet another symbol, and indeed the movie abounds with snorting horses, trains, flowers, and the like, all of them intercut in the narrative.  In theory, all this imagery is a commentary on sexuality; surprisingly, it actually works rather well.  But the infamy of ECSTASY rests on two scenes: the bathing scene, in which Hedy Lamarr swims and then runs naked through the countryside, and the sex scene, in which the camera holds on Lamarr's face as she appears to have an orgasm.

Nudity in film was not unheard of in American film, and many silent films sported barebreasted maidens.  The famous 1925 BEN-HUR not only featured such unclad women, it featured several unclad men as well.  By 1933, however, censorship was on the rise, and while the scene is rife with strategically placed branches, Lamarr's nude scene was indeed considered shocking by standards of the day.  But the real issue was the sex scene, which film historians describe as the first depiction of orgasm in a non-pornographic film.  Lamarr later commented that her facial expression was acheived by the director, who stuck her with a pin to make her grimmace during the shoot.  The notion of a woman enjoying sex horrified Americans from sea to shining sea.

ECSTASY was not only banned in the United States, it was also banned in Europe, although not for the same reasons.  That same year Lamarr married Fritz Mandl, heir to Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik Armaments, and by many accounts the jealous Mandl did his level best to buy and destroy every copy of the film he could find.  The film fared no better under the Nazis, for Lamarr was of Jewish descent.  In spite of various bans, the unedited film was smuggled into America, where it existed in the hands of a few wealthy collectors; when Lamarr became an American screen star, however, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer worked hard to track down and destroy these prints.  It is actually a little surprising that the film exists at all.

Watching the film today one may wonder what all the fuss was about.  It is interesting in its juxtapositions of imagery, but it is also rather slow, and the dialogue doesn't help any: in theory a German-language film, ECSTASY is more akin to a silent film.  Lamarr is an attractive young woman, but she was hardly the screen siren she later became, and while she runs naked with aplomb she isn't greatly memorable.  As for the notorious sex scene--well, by today's standards it is scarcely more than a hoot and holler.  The DVD print is not great, but it is watchable, and the DVD has no extras of any kind.  Worth watching?  If you are a film buff, yes.  If not, you might be better off with WHITE CARGO or ZIEGFELD GIRL.

736154,3,6303935184,"As with some of the others who reviewed this film, I rented it to see what the fuss was about, once upon a time, and found instead a surprisingly solid film. Hedy gives a very nice performance, even when fully clothed, which is after all, almost all of the film. In the beginning she is a young bride married to a middle aged man and it would have been nice to have had some scene to set up why she got married to this old fellow to begin with, but it's obvious from the start this isn't going anywhere fast, and Hedy goes into a slow death from lack of love, both the physical and emotional. Her performance is very sympathetic and the audience is inclined and expected to be indulgent with her. But her husband isn't played for laughs either, and the scene in which he finally realizes he's being cuckholded is itself very touching. Neither character is morally condemned in the course of the film, nor is her Lover for that matter. For a film that is largely silent, the acting is very modern in style and restrained. There are some pecularities for the modern viewer, especially in the final scenes where we get lots of shots of sturdy working men doing sturdy physical labor, with picks and shovels, building a new Germany I suppose. Maybe that was the price of getting the film released in 1933 Germany. Lots of emphasis on nature, with horses indulging in horse behavior, and lots of gypsies as well. But this is actually a fairly thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive film and well worth watching. And, Heddy in the buff is still pleasant to look at.",1235779200,7,1555,4.5177304964539005

One scene in Ecstasy showed her beauty, with full frontal nudity, at the young age of 18.  It was included in this movie for all the world to see, and appreciate, forever.  However, when I puchased this DVD, that particular scene was not included.  Some idiot editor deleted that scene.

736158,4,6303935184,"I purchased this flick because it has a notorious reputation, and my reaction was, ""Yeah, Right.  How wild could a 1932 movie be?""  Admittedly, Heddy Lamarr is shown swimming and running through a forest in the nude, and there is a love scene where she reportedly has the first orgasm ever filmed, but these scenes really contribute to a sense of naturalness to the film that I didn't find nasty or lewd....just artful.  The use of visual symbols throughout the film is rich, clever,and quite accessable to a modern mind, unlike other films approaching it's time.  I'm not a great scholar of films from the 30's, but I was reminded of clips I had seen of Leni Riefenstal's film, ""Olympia.""  There is little dialog, which is in German, although the film is subtitled, but that really removes what would otherwise distract one from enjoying the visual wealth of this film. The soundtrack is well in synchronized with the film in both timing and mood.  Altogether and interesting addition to any collection.",1151625600,21,1004,4.842105263157895
736159,2,6303935184,"This film is famous because of the nudity and blatant sexuality it entails. Not only does it show a naked woman running after her horse that has escaped, it is a long scene, and one that has a close-up from the chest up. This would be incredibly shocking for a film of the 1950s, let alone a film from the 1930s. Secondly, when the woman goes to her lover, the scene does not stop when the two kiss. In fact, it closes in on the woman's face as she thrives in ecstasy, suggesting an orgasm.

Hedy Lamarr is certainly beautiful and it is interesting to see her in this film because her look is dramatically different than that in her American films. Her transformation is akin to Joan Crawford's from the 1920s to the 1930s.

The film quality of Ecstacy is horrible, although not as bad as some. The print is covered in artifacts but the quality of the lighting still shines through. The silences are deafening, truly. They drown out the music score in the background and what little dialogue there is.

As an American watching this movie as a foreign film and as a fan of silent films, I was pleasantly surprised that most of the movie has no dialogue. I was not distracted by subtitles (often difficult to read in bad prints) throughout the film, much to it's merit.

The part of this movie that kills the film is the ending. When the woman could easily stay with her new lover, her guilt forces her to leave him. Then, the man is shown at work seemingly happy and either dreaming about his lover and their baby or living it. Whether or not this really happened or not is unclear because the emotions in the scene do not transition well. Sadly, it is the end of the film so it is not cleared up for the viewer.",1118102400,17,1711,4.35423197492163
736160,1,6303935184,"I was amazed by some of the camerawork in this film, enjoyed the inclusion of nudity and sensuality, and was awed by the forceful (propaganda?) images of manual laborers towards the end. The story is simple, but involving. If the film quality were good, I would give this film four or five stars. But I must warn you that while quite a few films this old have survived the ravages of time, or have been restored in one way or another, this film is in absolutely dreadful condition. The soundtrack hisses and rattles (deranging the music, since there is practically no dialogue), and the celluoid is thoroughly scratched, not to mention split asunder by occasional ""thunderbolts."" Perhaps it would have been too expensive to attempt a complete restoration of this particular film, but for the high price of the DVD, you'd expect some attempt to correct at least some of the damage. (Note: Anyone wishing to buy this strictly for the nude scenes will be largely disappointed because the nudity is mostly distant, and the film quality leaves most of the details to the viewer's imagination.) ""Extase"" definitely merits restoration, if it is feasible. As it is, the film quality so distracts from the viewing experience that it's painful to watch.",1111190400,59,1243,4.895734597156398
736161,4,6303935184,"This movie, starring a young Hedy Lamarr is proof of how sexual old films could be without showing much!
Ecstasy is basically the story of a young girl who marries an old guy (though they don't really explain why she did in the first place). He isn't at all interested in her on their wedding night...he isn't really interested in her at all! The simple prettiness of Hedy makes her seem like a girl you yourself would know and it makes it that much easier to feel all the emotions she is feeling. I was a little confused as to why there were silent parts (without even the use of dialogue boxes) and also talking parts. I personally liked the silent scenes. Hedy was a wonderful actress and her face alone could tell the entire story.
Anyways, after she requests a divorce from her husband, she lives with her father and while out alone one day, she decides to go swimming in the nude (this scene was blown way out of proportion; yes, she was naked, but I thought it was done very tastefully and you really don't see much). I won't give away all that happens, but by the end of that scene she meets a very VERY handsome land surveyor, who is everything she's searching for. After this initial meeting she later goes to his home and this results in the first on-screen orgasm, which was done simply showing Hedy's face, and it became, in my opinion, the hottest love scene ever!
Overall, this movie was excellent, though it should probably be seen more than once to see every little erotic message the director put in there. I would have given it five stars, but I didn't care for the ending. But please don't let that keep you from seeing this film! It is still wonderful!",1070496000,45,1673,4.435064935064935

written off as unacceptable. There is a new release from the Czech Republic, which censors Hedy's swimming scene, but apart from an interesting

7856497,5,6303935184,"Admittedly, these are not my words, but are very interesting none-the less:

In 1933, a beautiful, young Austrian woman took off her clothes for a movie director. She ran through the woods, naked. She swam in a lake, naked. Pushing well beyond the social norms of the period, the movie also featured a simulated orgasm. To make the scene ""vivid,"" the director reportedly stabbed the actress with a sharp pin just off-screen.

The most popular movie in 1933 was King Kong. But everyone in Hollywood was talking about that scandalous movie with the gorgeous, young Austrian woman.

Louis B. Mayer, of the giant studio MGM, said she was the most beautiful woman in the world. The film was banned practically everywhere, which of course made it even more popular and valuable. Mussolini reportedly refused to sell his copy at any price.

The star of the film, called Ecstasy, was Hedwig Kiesler. She said the secret of her beauty was ""to stand there and look stupid."" In reality, Kiesler was anything but stupid. She was a genius. She'd grown up as the only child of a prominent Jewish banker. She was a math prodigy. She excelled at science. As she grew older, she became ruthless, using all the power her body and mind gave her.

Between the sexual roles she played, her tremendous beauty, and the power of her intellect, Kiesler would confound the men in her life, including her six husbands, two of the most ruthless dictators of the 20th century, and one of the greatest movie producers in history.

Her beauty made her rich for a time. She is said to have made - and spent - $30 million in her life. But her greatest accomplishment resulted from her intellect, and her invention continues to shape the world we live in today.

You see, this young Austrian starlet would take one of the most valuable technologies ever developed right from under Hitler's nose. After fleeing to America , she not only became a major Hollywood star, her name sits on one of the most important patents ever granted by the U.S. Patent Office.

Today, when you use your cell phone or, over the next few years, as you experience super-fast wireless Internet access (via something called ""long-term evolution"" or ""LTE"" technology), you'll be using an extension of the technology a 20- year-old actress first conceived while sitting at dinner with Hitler.

At the time she made Ecstasy, Kiesler was married to one of the richest men in Austria . Friedrich Mandl was Austria 's leading arms maker. His firm would become a key supplier to the Nazis.

Mandl used his beautiful young wife as a showpiece at important business dinners with representatives of the Austrian, Italian, and German fascist forces. One of Mandl's favorite topics at these gatherings - which included meals with Hitler and Mussolini - was the technology surrounding radio-controlled missiles and torpedoes. Wireless weapons offered far greater ranges than the wire-controlled alternatives that prevailed at the time.

Kiesler sat through these dinners ""looking stupid,"" while absorbing everything she heard.

As a Jew, Kiesler hated the Nazis. She abhorred her husband's business ambitions. Mandl responded to his wilful wife by imprisoning her in his castle, Schloss Schwarzenau. In 1937, she managed to escape. She drugged her maid, snuck out of the castle wearing the maid's clothes, and sold her jewelry to finance a trip to London .

(She got out just in time. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria . The Nazis seized Mandl's factory. He was half Jewish. Mandl fled to Brazil . Later, he became an adviser to Argentina 's iconic populist president, Juan Peron.)

In London , Kiesler arranged a meeting with Louis B. Mayer. She signed a long-term contract with him, becoming one of MGM's biggest stars. She appeared in more than 20 films. She was a co-star to Clark Gable, Judy Garland, and even Bob Hope. Each of her first seven MGM movies was a blockbuster.

But Kiesler cared far more about fighting the Nazis than about making movies. At the height of her fame, in 1942, she developed a new kind of communications system, optimized for sending coded messages that couldn't be ""jammed."" She was building a system that would allow torpedoes and guided bombs to always reach their targets. She was building a system to kill Nazis.

By the 1940s, both the Nazis and the Allied forces were using the kind of single- frequency radio-controlled technology Kiesler's ex-husband had been peddling. The drawback of this technology was that the enemy could find the appropriate frequency and ""jam"" or intercept the signal, thereby interfering with the missile's intended path.

Kiesler's key innovation was to ""change the channel."" It was a way of encoding a message across a broad area of the wireless spectrum. If one part of the spectrum was jammed, the message would still get through on one of the other frequencies being used. The problem was, she could not figure out how to synchronize the frequency changes on both the receiver and the transmitter. To solve the problem, she turned to perhaps the world's first techno-musician, George Anthiel.

Anthiel was an acquaintance of Kiesler who achieved some notoriety for creating intricate musical compositions. He synchronized his melodies across twelve player pianos, producing stereophonic sounds no one had ever heard before. Kiesler incorporated Anthiel's technology for synchronizing his player pianos. Then, she was able to synchronize the frequency changes between a weapon's receiver and its transmitter.

On August 11, 1942, U.S. Patent No. 2,292,387 was granted to Antheil and ""Hedy Kiesler Markey,"" which was Kiesler's married name at the time.

Most of you won't recognize the name Kiesler. And no one would remember the name Hedy Markey. But it's a fair bet than anyone reading this newsletter of a certain age will remember one of the great beauties of Hollywood's golden age ~ Hedy Lamarr. That's the name Louis B. Mayer gave to his prize actress. That's the name his movie company made famous.

Meanwhile, almost no one knows Hedwig Kiesler - aka Hedy Lamarr - was one of the great pioneers of wireless communications. Her technology was developed by the U.S. Navy, which has used it ever since.

You're probably using Lamarr's technology, too. Her patent sits at the foundation of ""spread spectrum technology,"" which you use every day when you log on to a wi- fi network or make calls with your Bluetooth-enabled phone. It lies at the heart of the massive investments being made right now in so-called fourth-generation ""LTE"" wireless technology. This next generation of cell phones and cell towers will provide tremendous increases to wireless network speed and quality, by spreading wireless signals across the entire available spectrum. This kind of encoding is only possible using the kind of frequency switching that Hedwig Kiesler invented.",1356998400,11,6858,5.002633889376646

On the version of the edition that I have, the movie is 82 min. long VHS tape. But have seen versions stating 67 to 88 min. in total length. I wish that the original had never been tappered with, but imagine over the years, when it was released in different locations, it was cut, so there are probably several version out there.

It's a lot better than the stuff you see on tv today. This is 100% natural sexy appeal. I didn't care for the almost sudden ending, and I may have to watch it again to get the full value of the film.
