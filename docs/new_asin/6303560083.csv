683759,4,6303560083,"A great fan of Stanwyck's work I was quite entertained by this film; but only because she was in it - most of the other players are dull and mealy in contrast to the realistically alive Stanwyck. She's Naomi who's come back to the family she left for the stage ten years before. Needless to say that she ISN'T warmly received (except by the cook). Her daughter wants to be an actress as well (she has two; the other won't have anything to do with her)
In a great scene Stanwyck chides ""You have a mother with questionable morals and I've got a daughter with no GUTS"" Director Douglas Sirk was in awe of Stanwyck. Said he about the actress: ""She impresses me as someone who has been touched deeply by life in some way; she has great depth as a person and that's exactly what the audience sees on the screen; for that reason, she is a great star. Notice that Richard Long appears in this little flick which was made a dozen years before he and Stanwyck would star in the great western series THE BIG VALLEY!",944006400,,1005,4.322751322751323

7850616,4,6303560083,"Actually I saw it in the DVD version in the Stanwyck Collection. It was a mistake to purchase the VCR. But this was the first movie I ever saw with Stanwyck when I was only 9 years old when it first came out. I asked my mom on the way home, ""Who was the lady with the stars in her eyes?""

And she told me.

And have y'all ever noticed how Barbara Stanwyck always manages to get just beautiful stars in her eyes? It's really her most remarkable feature, I think.",1443052800,2,461,4.054945054945055
7850617,5,6303560083,I'm usually a little weary about purchasing VHS tapes but I was very impressed with the quality of not only the packaging but also the quality of the tape itself.  It was like I had just purchased it new off a video store self.,1392768000,2,227,4.159090909090909
7850618,2,6303560083,"Expertly filmed and staged, but with little substance. Central theme, of a woman who abandons her family for ten years (for no good reason as far as I can see)and returns to be accepted into the family again, is unconvincing. Looks like an excuse for the star (Barbara Stanwick)to go through her dramatic routine. Douglas Sirk has done much better (The Tarnished Angels, Written on the Wind, Imitation of Life, etc)",1353196800,2,415,4.859154929577465
7850619,4,6303560083,"Pure licorice soaked overnight in home made grapes syrup and stewed in honey. It is so romantic, so honey pie dramatic and sweetheart tragic that we just wonder if that kind of Hollywood love affairs should not be multiplied all over the world to make better evil and worse good, or maybe to make evil better and good worse, or maybe to make better good and worse evil, or even to make worse evil and better good, or whatever crisscross shooting game to kill twenty birds with one stone. And here mind you a whole flock of migrating ducks were shot with one bullet from a simple hunting rifle. I can't tell you how good it is and how bat it is.  The bad mother comes back from Chicago or whatever and she is going to take her daughter to New York, but she was a bad mother who abandoned her family to be an actress, and she is going to be a bad wife this time and take one of her daughters along with her. Shame on you. Luckily the bad guy comes into the picture and summons her to their meeting point and she goes and he gets shot and she is the culprit of course and she has to leave and what is the husband, abandoned once and who is going to be abandoned a second time, going to do. Please pray it ends well and the husband is a good man and the daughter is satisfied in her New York ambition, and that the wife will be punished for running around with sexual birds of prey and sexual offenders, pray for the girl to be strong enough to take her mother away from her father, pray the father is going to be enough of a coward to accept the pressure from the town and from his own daughters and the fate that is menacing him and let her go. Pray for a good ending and prey on it. Oh! How much the bird prey is a praying manta.

7850620,3,6303560083,"For fans of fifties melodramas and particularly the overwrought films of Douglas Sirk, ""All I Desire"" is a lesser known title in his canon which is worth a look. Filmed in crisp black and white with Ross Hunter producing, the film is an intriguing study of typical Sirk themes exposing the shallowness and hypocrisy of small town middle class Americana. What the film lacks of the overwrought technicolour films made after this one, it gains accordingly in credibility. The script is good and the film gains immeasurably from the realistic and touching central performance of the experienced Barbara Stanwyck. With the exception of an unconvincing happy ending forced on Sirk by Hunter, the film still resonates.

The print is restored and in great condition. The package includes a dreary commentary. The commentator consistently tells us what is happening on screen, which, of course, we can see for ourselves. The package is quite expensive.",1236297600,,944,5.169934640522876
7850621,4,6303560083,"The mark of director Douglas Sirk and producer Ross Hunter is all over this glossy melodrama. ALL I DESIRE gave Barbara Stanwyck one of her meatier roles during the lean years of the 1950s', playing a disgraced woman who returns to her hometown.

Based on the novel ""Stopover"" by Carol Ryrie Brink, the story concerns Naomi Murdoch (Barbara Stanwyck), a third-rate vaudevilian performer who abandoned her husband and children following a torrid affair in their tight-knit Wisconsin town. Ten years later, after receiving a heartfelt letter from younger daughter Lily (Lori Nelson), Naomi returns home to see her perform in the highschool play, re-opening old wounds and awakening painful memories.

With it's lush Edwardian period design, ALL I DESIRE is a very memorable movie, especially for fans of Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck must have relished playing such a full-blooded role; the 1950s' were not kind to actresses like Stanwyck, with most of the better roles going to younger stars.

The supporting cast also includes prime turns from Richard Carlson (as Naomi's schoolmaster husband), Lyle Bettger (the former lover hell-bent on resuming the affair), Marcia Henderson (the bitter older daughter), and Maureen O'Sullivan (the highschool drama teacher).

ALL I DESIRE, currently available on DVD in the United Kingdom, should hopefully receive a domestic release soon. Highly-recommended.",1195776000,,1393,5.4953271028037385

In this film, she's a failed stage actress who returns to her Midwestern home town to try to reconnect with the family she left long ago to seek fame and fortune, especially her estranged husband and her daughter, who also dreams of theatrical stardom.  She also has to deal with and resolve old scandal surrounding her name.",1104278400,,493,4.655172413793103
