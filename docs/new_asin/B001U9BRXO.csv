3797400,5,B001U9BRXO,I loved the insight this film gives and how real it makes it.  So much is going on and most of us don't bat an eye at it.  Maybe one day people will listen.,1372723200,,156,3.5588235294117645

3797402,3,B001U9BRXO,"It may not be perfect .., but it is someone's effort to alert.., not blame.., but to alert, ring the bell and challenge a serious
effort to ignore the writ of habeas corpus. A writ so fundamentally basic to democracy... that allows, even insists upon the right,
that every individual has, to have their day in court, face their accuser, hear the evidence and mount a defense. All cards on
the table for everyone to view, hear, touch and feel. Finally to analyze and come to a rational and reasonable conclusion that
the accused is guilty or innocent...., with the option to be appealed or re-prosecuted.

 I personally do not perceive my own safety from wrongful persecution. Because of this
policy and with the kill anything that moves, drone policy.., who is acting as judge, jury and executioner?  I certainly feel no
more special then a Somalian citizen.  Nothing American about this set of policies.  Just an excuse and opportunity for someone to learn how
to arbitrarily select out someone who once pissed them off, for stealing a parking space and found a way to put them in harms way..,
well at least to annoy the hell out of them.

Can you imagine what Nixon and his plumbers could have done with this Power to harass their Enemies List?  OMG!  You really believe the
power is self-limiting?  Who is watching and limiting the application of this policy?

 Imagine!  One day your free, with no guilt to carry about for anything other then you were late for a date,
picking up your kid after day-care or having a fantasy about an affair.  The next moment you are arrested, and destined to a dark place, with no
explanation. Even your wife, kids and relatives have no clue what happened. They file missing person reports and that is it.  No answers.  You become
a symbol on a black flag...,  MIA or MDAL or Missing During Activity of Life.

3797403,1,B001U9BRXO,"This movie was not very impressive. The ""experts,"" the music, the editing all all fail to impart a convincing argument.  The cast are the typical types - such as a liberal journalist and a Georgetown professor.  Opinions are presented as fact, and fact is mostly non-existent.
It's the kind of film one could imagine making sense to a young college student, who, between bong hits in her dorm, riffs to her friends ""See, George Bush is evil!""",1363996800,,442,4.7272727272727275
3797404,4,B001U9BRXO,That's the question this documentary asks as it shows you how secrecy began in the US government. Can it harm but is it also necessary? It's an important question that citizens should ask to decide what we ask of our government and what level of secrecy we can accept but also know when we need to demand transparency to avoid abuse of power.,1363219200,,342,4.444444444444445
3797405,5,B001U9BRXO,A brilliant movie.  Just what this country needs.  A reflection on our recent history.  Since Amazon requires twenty words I guess I will say that the movie was remarkable and unique in its delivery and content.,1356220800,,211,4.805555555555555
3797406,5,B001U9BRXO,"I  recommend this to any voter or tax payer who wants to be informed in their decision making process.

I thought it did a good job of presenting arguments for and against secrecy, as well as describing the stakes.

The film-makers' opinions do show through the film as a documentary, but some of the interviews will likely be insightful to anybody who isn't already an intelligence expert.

It is a bit slow, but I think this deserves 5 stars despite being somewhat slow paced in part because the material is important enough to warrant pauses for consideration.",1351900800,,563,4.77319587628866
3797407,4,B001U9BRXO,"A variety of perspectives is presented here, as well as useful information. I came away with a clearer sense of the intertwining issues, timelines, pressures, causes and outcomes that have led to the complex behemoth called government secrecy. The struggle presented in this documentary is where to draw the line between revelation and concealment and how to maintain a rational balance between the two. It isn't likely we'll ever reach a unanimous opinion in a country this size but we should all at least have a sense of the dynamics and what's at stake.

As others have pointed out, the information could have been organized in a more chronological manner. At the same time, the mosaic-like presentation made individual stories and pieces of information stand out more for me.  An interesting documentary to pair with this one is Cheney's Law, which also involves the topic of secrecy.",1327276800,4,888,5.034013605442177
3797408,1,B001U9BRXO,"The premise of this documentary was interesting, however the way it was put together made me feel like I was watching a grainy old documentary back in grade school. There was hardly any ""wow"" factor that really made me think about how the government handles top secret material. I think we all know the government is less than honest with the American public. This concept was not earth shattering. That's about all this documentary had to offer. It may have been more tolerable if it wasn't continually jumping from one event to another and instead focused on a single event from start to finish before moving on.",1326585600,,614,4.747663551401869
3797409,4,B001U9BRXO,"The recent history and evolution of the policies of the US Government regarding national security, covert operations, the gathering of intelligence, the treatment of prisoners, the dissemination of information, and the genesis of the policy of governmental secrecy, are among the subjects covered in the documentary Secrecy (2008).  The film acknowledges some of the key events in American history that affected change in intelligence policy.  These include World War II, the Manhattan Project, the Cold War, the formation of the CIA, the terrorist attacks on 9/11, and conflicts in the Middle East.  Also discussed is the genesis of the State's Secret privilege, a legal means where evidence can be excluded from a case, if the Government provides statements that attest that nation security would be compromised.

The film consists primarily of interview clips with various individuals, including those involved in the intelligence field, former government officials, reporters, legal experts, and relatives of victims killed while conducting government business.  While there are many opinions expressed, and some interesting and provocative subjects are explored, the somewhat unorganized way that the film jumps around between numerous subjects, isn't the most conducive to understanding the situation.  Discussion of historical events, comments and opinions, personal experiences, and coverage of specific cases, are all mixed together.

A better approach might have been to lay a basic foundation, then focus on how the State's Secret privilege was established, and then move on to the various related subjects.  While the material to do this effectively may not have been available, the producers certainly could have improved on the way the information is presented.

The crucial precedent setting case that established the State's Secrets Privilege, involved a US Air Force B-29 that crashed in 1948, while on a mission to perform top secret tests.  An investigation of the crash was conducted, and a report was issued.  The apparent conclusion was that recommended maintenance procedures were not followed by the Air Force, which eventually contributed to the crash, and the death of nine men.  In a case that went up to the Supreme Court in 1952, the release of the report was deemed as a compromise of national security, setting a legal precedent that is routinely employed today to permit the Government to keep certain matters secret.  As a result of this decision, the truth regarding the cause of the crash was kept secret for fifty years.  Some of the relatives of those killed in the accident, died never knowing the truth.  Those who may have been entitled to monetary compensation through the courts, were denied that opportunity.

In regards to secrecy, matters are seldom black and white.  Some may think otherwise, but what constitutes ""national security"" is typically determined at some level by the Government, be that an individual, a committee, or even at the judicial level.  Often, the average citizen will have no knowledge of the situation, and even if they do, will have little or no power to affect anything.  The documentary does a good job of pointing out the kind of injustices and inequities that unfortunately can occur under such conditions.

The US Government has used the legal system to try and prevent what are deemed as secrets in the national interest from being revealed.  Expecting anything else would be unrealistic, as most government agencies operate to protect their interests, and not necessarily to serve justice, or the interests of the people.  While regrettable, such is the nature of man, power, and government.

Post 9/11, America has become even more acutely aware of the importance of maintaining security, however what constitutes ""security"" is subject to much interpretation.  For some, achieving that goal can be a very dirty business, where the law is not always followed.  With the Government generally reluctant to break secrecy, uncovering covert or illegal actions will be difficult.  So the incidents revealed in this documentary are quite enlightening and intriguing, and undoubtedly only the tiniest tip of an iceberg.",1326499200,4,4190,5.349085365853658

8343195,5,B001U9BRXO,"There are a number of disturbing current trends in the USA and world too.
This is one of them.
To me, it's important to know what is going on with our government behind the political spin we hear all the time.
This documentary is well done, informative and entertaining.",1396656000,,270,4.530612244897959
8343196,5,B001U9BRXO,"I expected this documentary to be only about the costs of secrecy, but it's not.  It's also not filled with action as it's just interviews and some background footage.  For me this was very entertaining.

The people interviewed that ""get it"" about secrecy aren't advocating more or less secrecy, in general.  They're discussing the needs, costs, options and human nature.  I felt that I understood why the subject can be so morose.  At the end of the day, there is no right balance and everything is a matter of character and courage.

I recommend this documentary to those that like thoughtful interviews and are interested in the issues related to government secrets.",1392422400,,669,4.919642857142857

8343199,1,B001U9BRXO,"This did not really give much information. It mostly bashed the George W. Bush Administration after 9/11. It talked a lot about Guantanamo Bay and torture. This piece was not balanced and didn't cover other presidents very much. Obama has the most secretive administration from top to bottom in history.  No documentaries are being done about that. Also, to compare our interrogation methods and Guantanamo Bay to the Tiger Cages in Vietnam for their POWs made me literally sick to my stomach. What an ignorant thing to say, fueled by a hate-fueled Left-wing agenda.",1386201600,,566,5.0212765957446805
8343200,1,B001U9BRXO,"I stopped watching after the first 20 minutes, and even those 20 minutes seemed to drag on for a lifetime.",1382572800,,106,4.35
8343201,5,B001U9BRXO,"Apparently very big. As a country spend billions to gather mountains of information. This brings some very big questions. If you have all this information how to you use it to protect the country? Mountains of information alone do not stop terrorist attaches. It becomes difficult to clarify, sort and ultimately act on. Most of the interventions against terrorists have been due to the common man in the streets who alerted police to a problem. Secret information did not stop Pearl Harbor, 9/11 or the underwear bomber.

Some of this secret information our government obtained was under very questionable circumstances. Should we be allowed to go to random foreign countries and remove a person, fly them to a secret destination and question/torcher them? When is torcher acceptable? When is information gathered from torcher reliable? Should we do such practices?

The US government reports to no one. They seem to be accountable to no one. They can hide behind ""secret information"" to stay out of court or to give accountability.

Overall a good interesting short film. Makes you think and wonder.",1382140800,,1101,5.105555555555555
