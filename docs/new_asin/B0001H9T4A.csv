2002670,5,B0001H9T4A,"Lawrence Welk:  God Bless America

This DVD was sold on public television and is a great trip down memory lane in many ways.  Lawrence Welk is remembered and referenced on the show, although the video was made in 2003 and he is not the host.

Video is 100 minutes long on one single DVD--terrific for a gathering of Lawrence Welk fans.  This would be great to show to senior citizens as a ""movie night"" feature.  There are tons of songs from the earlier 1900s, including songs that were most famous during the wars.

DVD is broken up into four ""acts"", so you could also show just 1-2 acts at a time.  Act One covers the years 1900-1935; Act Two covers the Big Band Era through the 1950s; Act Three covers 1961-81; Act Four begins with Lawrence Welk's retirement in 1984.

Show is co-hosted by Mary Lou Metzger and Tom Netherton, and was made in a theater with a live audience.

Stars include:  Elaine Balden, Bobby Burgess, Jo Ann Castle, Henry Cuesta, Dick Dale, Anacani, Ralna English, Joe Feeney, Myron Floren, Guy Hovis, Jack Imel, the Lennon Sisters, Bob Ralston, and Norma Zimmer, plus The Welk Champagne Music Makers directed by John Bahler.  Special appearance by the University of Central Oklahoma Band, under the direction of Dr. Brian Lamb.

Great salute to America, and very memorable DVD for fans of the Lawrence Welk Show.  Two thumbs up!  A one and a two and a....",1270684800,24,1379,4.617283950617284

In addition, the nursing home staff has told me that having the music playing constantly in her room has changed her behavior in a remarkable way. She is calmer and is not as bored as she was by watching network TV. Knowing that she is more relaxed has also given me more peace of mind. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who is looking for more sources of entertainment for the elders in their family.",1399420800,10,566,4.201834862385321
