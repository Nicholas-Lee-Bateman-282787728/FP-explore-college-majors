8598394,5,B00DVPN1JS,"I am a fan of Cesar Romero. I have to admit I didn't know who he was when I was a kid watching him play the Joker in Bat Man. When I see Romero as the Cisco Kid and also in movies he appeared in, I see a man of great CONFIDENCE. He is one of those actors I would have loved to have met.  If you're a fan of Mr Romero, you will love him as the Cisco Kid.",1402790400,,353,3.4125
8598395,5,B00DVPN1JS,"Yes, Cesar Romero as the Cisco Kid.  NOT the TV series one.  Much better and believable Cisco Kid with humor and excitement.  These movies were so much fun to watch.  Romero, known more for The Joker in Batman, was a great actor and played Cisco very well.",1388620800,2,256,4.382978723404255
