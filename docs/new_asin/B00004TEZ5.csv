7922474,3,B00004TEZ5,"A thorough tour over Idaho. Most informative history, industry development and
gorgeous views. HOWEVER, after viewing this program on Aerial America I ordered
a DVD copy to keep. Had to send it back as it came without the narrative an essential
part of the information!!",1407888000,,270,5.022222222222222
7922475,3,B00004TEZ5,"I liked seeing parts of Idaho I had not seen before.  I liked seeing the mountains, rivers, and lakes.  I liked  the narration Adam West gave when he talked. However, I did not like the music (and I love music).  The music was distracting, 70ish, not particularly melodic,  and sometimes drowned out the narration.  The final song was okay, but it seemed strange after  weird instrumental all the way through to suddenly have a vocalist mirror the title.  I also thought there was too much zeroing in on buildings with no explanation of what buildings they were.  I actually  felt a little nauseous as the plane dipped and banked.  Sometimes I had no idea who Adam West was quoting-- there wasn't enough explanation given.  I guess I didn't see enough of what I wanted to see.  I also would have preferred natural prairie sounds or river sounds instead of the music.  I felt a little homesick as I watched... and I found places I would like to visit that I haven't seen before, so for that reason, I gave it three stars.",1394841600,,1020,4.532967032967033
7922476,3,B00004TEZ5,This was good but I wish there had been more narration as to what we were seeing. I like the Smithsonian Aerial America better.,1393632000,,127,4.333333333333333
7922477,4,B00004TEZ5,"Its nice to see the beauty from a different angle.
Watch the video and get out to see it for yourself. It is definitely worth watching.",1392595200,,135,4.230769230769231
7922478,4,B00004TEZ5,"It is so nice to take some time away from our daily grind and relax as your watching this film on Idaho. Its amazing the things that our here right in our own back door. You don't have to  go out of this state for vacation, you just got to get out more",1370649600,,252,3.7547169811320753
7922479,1,B00004TEZ5,"We loved the ""Over California"" Video and wanted to see the beauty of Idaho from an aerial view as well.  This one was much slower, the video quality was not as good and it was very shakey (made my wife motion sick.
There are a few nice scenery clips - Fast Forward works well for this.",1220140800,,285,4.089285714285714
