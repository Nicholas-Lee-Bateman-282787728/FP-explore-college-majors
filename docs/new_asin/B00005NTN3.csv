1637804,5,B00005NTN3,"I managed to catch this one on the independant film channel, and I'm glad I did.
We all know romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, and though I admit to being a sucker for some, I always know the plots are predictable. Some I just watch because of who's in them, and hope that they'll be different. I lose on that score, often.
Well, this one was different. Sure, there's a love story (is there?), but there are a lot of side stories going on here.
Adam is introduced to us in a typical sort of fashion, like many love stories, and begins romancing Kate Hudson, and it seems like your regular fare, right? Sure, they are attractive, charming, but what's so special about this movie?
Well, THEN he meets the family, and that's when things get.....interesting. Told from three sisters' perspectives, it was a refreshing way to show how this Adam is seen by each person, and to see what was happening in each scene, as some are repeated, BUT from a different POV, which makes them seem new. Even one of the men seems to fall for him, as Adam is ""all things to all people"". Which seems to be what he's there for. But just who is Adam, really? Well, regardless of the movie's title, we never really know for certain. It's really about these OTHER people, see. Adam is never shown as himself (or is he?), only as he's perceived by others.
It is a real ensemble effort, and all of the actors are engaging in this film, down to the smallest parts. I believe it's Francis that plays the ""repressed"", bookish sister, and she is really wonderful in this movie.
I do have to note Stuart seems to fit the part like a glove, he's a pleasure to watch. Another actor might not have pulled off what he did..and that was to be so charming, so attractive, and somehow seem sincere (even though that's highly questionable) enough that I about forgave him, when I should hate him.
He's a cad..but somehow things work out. If you have sisters, especially, you should probably be appalled..and yet it's so damn...charming.
It's a bit self relevatory, if you ask yourself ""what would I have done""?
I'll freely admit..I probably would have said ""what the hell, why not""?
(then again, I don't have sisters!)
So, you may be appalled at the morals of these characters, which seems to be the critique of many who didn't like it, but leave the ""real world"" for a time and just watch the story unfold. Good acting, clever dialogue, film editing and a different sort of story than the norm, makes it a guilty pleasure.
(And Stuart is just too yummy, at the risk of sounding like a schoolgirl. He's also a fine actor)",1064707200,16,2584,4.476694915254237
1637805,5,B00005NTN3,"I loved this movie, the acting was great and Stuart Townsend, even though the movie wasn't completely about him was what made it. He is absolutely stunning and sizzling. Kate Hudson was sweet and the plot amazing. Great flick.",1063497600,6,226,4.82051282051282
1637806,5,B00005NTN3,"This movie is hilarious in so many shapes and forms!  You can't help but love Adam, even though you know that you should hate him and want horrible consequences for his actions!  And then you're forced to think about what sister you're most like and how you'd react if Adam seduced you.  You like to think that you'd be a nice, moral woman who knew not to get involved with such a conniving, creepy, sinister man, but you know that deep down, you'd jump in the sack with him immediately!  Eeek, heartwrenching self-discovery!  *grin*",1061769600,4,533,4.627659574468085

1637808,5,B00005NTN3,"About Adam is clever, hip and has an amazing cast. Especially the neurotic Frances O'Connor, and the absolutely devilish Stuart Townsend as the irresistable cad Adam. This movie will make you laugh till it hurts. It's absolutly outrageous!
Told in the first person perspectives of 3 sisters and their brother all of which form strong ties with the camelian like character of Adam.
Adam seems the perfect lover, husband, friend, son in law or anything else he is requested to be. It's a fasinating look at how one man can involve himself so completely with one family in what seem to be a matter of weeks.
You should hate Adam, and especially if your a woman, fear a man like Adam, but you just wish that he could come and knock on your door and give you all your hearts desires.
This film is a funny guily pleasure that you will be glad to slip in to your DVD player over and over again.",1023840000,9,887,4.414634146341464
1637809,4,B00005NTN3,"Christina Rossetti fans take notice. This is possibly one of the only movies that will ever devote any time to her writing. I was delighted with the discussion of her piece ""The Goblin Market,"" and I knew then that this movie wasn't going to be just a little bit of fluff.
It is indeed a romantic comedy, but it doesn't stop at love and laughs. It challenges the notion of trust and morality without a hint of condemnation. Having the fantasy unfold through mulitple characters' points of view was a wonderful thing and the actors carried off the movie charmingly.
This movie lingered in my mind enough to cause me to see it again after initially viewing it. Perhaps not the best movie ever made, but certainly a pleasant way to idle away an evening.",1019088000,3,750,4.562962962962963
1637810,3,B00005NTN3,"About Adam is well written, well directed and well acted, featuring a number of charming characters played by beautiful people.  My only complaint would be that, for all that, Adam is a little difficult to like for most of the movie, although, as portrayed by Stuart Townsend, he's always very attractive.  As three very different sisters who fall under Adam's spell, Kate Hudson, Frances O'Connor and Charlotte Bradley all bring a lot of character to their parts, while Alan Maher and Rosaleen Linehan were hilarious as their brother and mother.
It's generally a very sweet little movie, but often things don't feel quite right.  It starts off very strongly, but loses some of its appeal towards the end, perhaps because you see it through Alice's more realistic eyes, and its all a bit preposterous.",1018396800,2,801,4.962686567164179
1637811,5,B00005NTN3,"One of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. I would probably have to even place it higher than Bridget Jones's Diary. I adored the multi-faceted view points and the eloquently woven love-hate relationship that the director managed to extract out of the viewer towards Adam. I think that one viewer wrote it best ""you love him, you hate him, you want him"". That's most certainly true from a girl's point of view. I saw this movie thrice before it was disappointingly taken down from my local theater.
(And just to set the record straight, this is an IRISH film, not a BRITISH film! The accents are COMPLETELY different!)
Townsend is charming, devious, scandalous, and completely adorable. Kate Hudson is a true sweetheart; you just want to wrap her up and take her home with you! I loved the symbolism of the Jag throughout the movie. (When I get a boyfriend, I'm going to make him get one of those.) There were also allusions to more-than-meets-the-eye between Adam and the mother. I would have liked to see a bit more of that, however. It rather left me dangling.
A MUST SEE! THREE THUMBS UP! TEN STARS!",1011484800,8,1112,4.649746192893401
1637812,4,B00005NTN3,"If you're not expecting a profound existential message, this is a decent movie to watch. The plot can be summarized in a few sentences. Adam (played by Stuart Townsend) meets Kate Hudson's character, who is the youngest of three sisters, in a pub. He quickly charms her and before long they're in bed together. But it doesn't stop there. When Adam meets the family, he quickly seduces the middle sister and eventually the oldest. Even the brother of the three sisters is attracted to him.

What makes this movie a bit unusual is that it is told from the perspective of the three sisters in turn, beginning with the youngest and proceeding to the oldest. At first this is just a bit confusing (at least it was to me), since various scenes are replayed two or three times. But we quickly catch on to the fact that we are seeing this through the eyes of each of the sisters in turn. The crucial scene in all this is the one in which Adam agrees to marry the youngest sister, doing so in public (again in the pub) and in the presence of the other two sisters.

If you can get past the rather slow start (my wife and I almost bailed out after fifteen minutes), the movie begins to pick up and becomes funny and enjoyable to watch. And if you can get over the fact that Adam, while having charm, seemingly has no truly redeeming moral characteristics, and that the ending is somewhat unrealistic, it's a movie worth watching once.",1399680000,,1424,4.452107279693487
1637813,1,B00005NTN3,I personally gave this movie a one because I found it very stupid and boring.  I REALLY don't know where other viewers found it funny and nice to watch. I just think this movie is really not my taste.. three sisters sleeping with the same guy.... that's just straight nasty....,1379721600,2,277,4.54

I don't undestand this acid react to the plot y see and read a whorse behavior in real life in this country about family issues. In the movie Adam never hide nothing to his tree sisters lovers, but they hide, her affairs each other whit adam. Obviusly he suduce them, but never obligate them to do something that they don't want to do. Every card it was put on the table and every sister made her choise. Free Will.

Maybe in the real life this situation couldn't be. But in this days it would be possible. I like this movie by adam caracther sex inuendo power. but scare me by female characters unrespect choises.

But actually, it's that he is terminally hetero, with every female in his circle, including the sister and girlfriend of the real girlfriend he's about to marry. I enjoyed this Lothario tale, set in Ireland. The message is decidedly non-PC. In fact, the film seems to celebrate Adam's serial cheating as his merely getting the most enjoyment out of life. It was a tad silly.",1346544000,,439,4.641025641025641

1637818,5,B00005NTN3,I  loved  how  the  story  here  is  told  and  retold  again  from  the  different  perspectives  of  each of  the  3 sisters. Stuart  Townsends  character  and  the  way  each  of  the  segments  unfolds  is  brilliant. Funny  and  witty. Irish comedian  Tommy  Tiernan  has  a  small  cameo  roll  also. But  there  is  no  doubt  that  Stuart  Townsend  is  the  start  attraction  as  he  seems  to  offer  exactly  what  each  sister  needs.

than we have the problem Kate Hudson. I've seen a couple of her movies, and from now on I will just avoid movies she's in. No talent.
She's into copying the ""cuteness"" of her mom Goldie Hawn in all the movies she's in, so it seems. And highly irritating.

1637821,3,B00005NTN3,"I did not even know the tag-line to the film About Adam (or All About Adam) but my first thought after I saw it was ""He came, He saw, He conquered...them all."" And it is almost identical with the film tag-line ""He came. He saw. He conquered. One sister at a time."" Gerard Stembridge's film belongs to the long suffered and rarely done well genre of romantic comedy or so called chick flick but this movie was a nice surprise. It has a twist to it, is amusing, enjoyable and funny, at least up until the very final. In the end, the writer/director seemed to have lost an interest of simply did not know what to do with his main character who could've been a lighter version or a younger brother to Pasolini's mysterious visitor in Theorem or, if asked Who are you, he could've answered, Just your average, horny little devil, not unlike Mr. Darryl van Horn. Yes, About Adam may not use any original ideas and it brings to mind immediately the movies as different as Theorem; Sliding Doors; He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not; the Spanish Oscar winner for the Best Foreign movie, Bell poque, The Witches of Eastwick, and more than one Woody Allen's dramedies, Hannah and Her Sisters, particularly. The story of a charming mysterious man who makes every member of one family fall hard for him simply by being there and expressing the interest to each person's problems, troubles, and needs has been told many times but I personally was amused and smiled more than once while watching this little comedy and I found it if not a bright lost gem but a nice way to spend an hour and half following the adventures of a nice guy , every girl's dream come true who could make women happy because he knew exactly what each of them wanted, needed, longed for, lacked in her life, and dreamed about. I found especially funny always changing and adjusted for a particular listener the story of the powerful sexy mysterious collectible Jaguar, the perfect car for a sexy, mysterious, perfect man. Cinematically, the movie that takes place in Dublin is very pleasant, and I did not mind the repeating narrative that helped to look at the same scenes from very different perspectives and unexpected points of view. The young and talented actors and actresses including pre-Almost Famous very cute and singing Kate Hudson, Frances O'Connor and Charlotte Bradley as her older sisters, and Stuart Townsend as irresistible Adam all made their characters likable which is important for this type of film.

1637822,3,B00005NTN3,"'About Adam' is billed as a comedy but it's safer to classify it as a farce. It's set in Dublin and it focuses on a family of three sisters and one brother who all become besotted with Adam, a charming Lothario, who insinuates himself into their lives. Unlike most American films where men end up chasing a beautiful woman, 'About Adam' turns the tables and we're treated to the farcical machinations of women who can no longer control their passions when attracted to that one special 'mysterious' man.

'About Adam' has a Rashomon-like plot where the story is told from the successive points of view of each sibling. We start off from Lucy's point of view (Kate Hudson) who meets Adam at her place of employment (where she works as a waitress/singer). Lucy is looking for a man who will sweep her off her feet. I'm not sure how Adam manages to press all the right buttons of these women, but they all become besotted with him. The initial seduction of Lucy goes on for way too long and after awhile her obsession with him becomes tiresome (the first 30 minutes is the weakest part of the film).

After about half an hour into the film, conflict finally emerges. Soon after meeting Lucy, Adam decides to seduce Lucy's sister, Laura (Frances O'Connor). Laura is more intellectual than Lucy, studying for her PhD in poetry. And of course Adam is familiar with the very obscure poetry Lucy has been studying at school and recites it to her, pressing her buttons. Before you know it, Laura is stripping off HER clothes for him! Adam isn't finished. Brother David finds himself attracted to Adam and fantasizes having a bi-sexual affair with him. He doesn't actually act upon his fantasies but Adam somehow engenders a passionate spark in him and he ends up with a new invigorated love life with his girlfriend.

Finally there's Alice, trapped in a loveless marriage who also has a child. Alice is aware that Adam has been playing around with BOTH of her sisters and when she finally gives in to Adam before his marriage to Lucy, it's on HER terms. She knows it's just a fling, but the brief affair with Adam awakens her long repressed sexual passions.

For those who were 'offended' by this film, they completely miss the purpose of farce. In the words of the noted drama critic Eric Bentley, in farce, one is permitted the outrage without the consequences! Farce allows its audience to experience deep-seated desires vicariously! While the sisters feel there is some deeper meaning in Adam's name (noting that Adam is the name of the progenitor of all men), one should liken him more to the Greek God Pan, famous for his sexual powers and often depicted with an erect phallus.

The world of 'About Adam' features no recriminations. While some feelings are ruffled, none of the characters suffer any permanent psychic damage. Even Laura, probably the most besotted and jealous of the sisters, accepts Adam's marriage to Lucy and we see her holding hands with her school supervisor at the end of the film, now ready for a mature romance in the real world. And although Adam is always lying to each of the women about his background, the lies are white lies--inconsequential; again resulting in no harm (Adam even suggests to Lucy who is having second thoughts about getting married just as they're about to tie the knot, that people don't always have to know each other's secrets; that way, petty jealousies are averted!).

'About Adam' is like a gentle breeze. It's a light-hearted farce not to be taken too seriously (for all of you offended by its alleged 'immorality', I say get a life!). In addition, it's an original take on the desire for passion in our lives. On the other hand, by the end of the film, we realize that the film's tension has dissipated. All that fun 'passion' unleashed in each sibling by the charming rake Adam, has become a bit repetitious and overdone. In other words, we get the point! By the end there are no more surprises! Since 'About Adam' is a bit offbeat and good-natured, I give it a '3'. But honestly, while 'About Adam' is definitely worth watching, one viewing is enough.",1236988800,,4107,4.697222222222222
1637823,4,B00005NTN3,"My partner was a bit disturbed by the proceedings of ""About Adam"". Too much deception for his tastes, but I don't think one can take the story of this film too seriously.  It's about Adam, of course, this gorgeous guy (played by the gorgeous Stuart Townsend) who meets and becomes involved with the lovely Lucy (played by the lovely Kate Hudson, who has a wonderful singing voice that she gets to display in the flick).  It's also about Lucy's two sisters and her brother and how they get to know her new boyfriend.  Frances O'Connor delivers a terrific performance as Lucy's bookwormish sister who evolves into a new person as the film goes along.  And I mustn't forget to mention that the film was filmed in Ireland (Dublin to be exact) and the accents are all quite believable.

""About Adam"" is not a groundbreaking film, but it does offer some nice comic performances--and I enjoyed the way the writer/director Gerard Stembridge sets up the film from many different points of view.  It's light entertainment, and sometimes you just want to curl up on the couch with just such a movie.  At least I do.",1198713600,3,1104,4.65979381443299

But in the movies, this sort of thing can be very funny, for a person with an open mind such as myself.  Adam shags basically anyone with 2 legs - dudes are not excluded.  Stuart Townsend smiles, smirks, grins, his way through this entire movie, looking like he's having the time of his life while doing so.  We find out at the end of the movie why he is the way he is.  His simple statement of fact:  ""It just makes me happy to make other people happy"".  Hey, I'm all for that, and though I wouldn't go around humping people to prove my point, I'm all for helping my fellow man :)

One way, and only one : share and share and share again,  and then love and love and love again, in three words  share your love . The man, lover and future husband of one sister is to be shared in mutual ignorance and perfect communion with the two other sisters, a little bit with the brother, and even a little bit more with the brother's would-be girlfriend and even a little tiny bit more or less with the mother of them all. It's a comedy but it is not at all hilarious, just comfortable, cosy and even kind of quaint, quaint like in Boccaccio or Chaucer. The best part of this film is that it is absolutely and deeply sexy and yet you will not see one breast, you will not even see the shape of any sexual attribute, you will hardly see any skin, and yet you will be moved in the deepest depth of your sensual excitement and excitation, in one word you will irresistibly desire and want and wish to meet that Adam and have a conversation with him, no matter what, and let fate and destiny and predestination decide whatever may happen later on. Be sure you will be absolutely flawless afterward because all that will feel, taste and sound absolutely pure, virginal and pristinely chaste, even and especially if it is nothing but exactly the reverse, in your mind, in your bed, or his, and even in your lingerie, or shall we say skin-clothing. This feeling is probably the best feeling such a light and superficial film can nurture in you. At least it is good for your general balance : you feel as if you were floating - mentally, spiritually and metaphorically - in the boat of your mother's uterus again.
