8353121,5,B0026MOVNC,"An art restorer gets curious about why Micelangelo's Moses is asymmetrical, and it leads him to the underground life of the Reformation in the Catholic church.  Spoiler alert: The would-be Pope that would have incorporated some of Martin Luther's reforms lost by one vote.  What a different history we could have had.",1506988800,,317,5.076923076923077

8353123,5,B0026MOVNC,I've read the reviews of this program that criticize it for being based on so much speculation.  I understand that criticism but disagree with it.  New ways of thinking have often been criticized by those who believe history is cast in stone rather than realizing it is limited only by our understanding of it.  This video offers new (to me) and deep insights into Michelangelo's character and demonstrates his sometimes difficult relationship with the men who usurped the papacy during this troubled and dangerously political time in the Church's history -- and how that affected his art.  The theories presented in this program suggest reasonable possibilities that are deliciously interesting to contemplate.  This is stimulating and enlightening television.  It's a good video to own because you're going to want to watch it over and over.,1453593600,,843,5.207407407407407

8353126,5,B0026MOVNC,"Ever tried to do right, only to learn (the hard way) that your management organization doesn't really care about ""right""? It's just another buzzword, ""right""? Do or say something that crosses or minimizes or scrutinizes an oligarch or an entire oligopoly with absolute authority (or, as in Michelangelo's case, relegates the subject organization, being the Catholic Church, as irrelevant and unnecessary) and you will quickly find out what the true definition of ""right"" is. ""Right"" is what the authoritarians who control your future decide it is.

If you have been stomped into the dirt by an organization you thought would back you up when you identified some of the corrupt aspects of the executive agglomeration, only to discover that management does not want to hear any amount or form of feedback which does not reflect upon them in good light, then this is must-see video for you. Even the very best and brightest of our race have been ridiculed, humiliated and outcast by the powers-that-be for having pointed out their flaws and foibles. Michelangelo was left with nothing else to do other than to shut up and to leave behind a few very interesting and carefully veiled hints and inklings that only the keenest of history detectives would ever be able to sort out. This is a sad story, but it's one you need to know about. We all need to know this story.",1371945600,,1363,4.8247863247863245
8353127,1,B0026MOVNC,"Okay, it says above the little box in which I am now typing that this review must be at least 20 words long.  On the side of this box is yet another box which has 2 points which answer the question: What makes a good review? The first point is for a reviewer to be detailed and specific and state what the reviewer would have wanted to know before purchasing the product.  The second point is not to make ones review too short or too long. It then states: Aim for between 75 and 300 words.

Bored yet?

Why do I begin my review on Secrets of the Dead: Michelangelo Revealed babbling about Amazon's ordinary rules and instructions for reviewers? Because about now maybe you are feeling what I felt 10 minutes into this movie--annoyed. If you enjoy stuffing your mind with information regardless of its value to truly nourish, then this DVD was made for you. On the other hand if you want to grow in knowledge, in truth, if you are in search of the Divine, then don't waste time watching it.

All I really needed to say is this: please read Mr. W. J. Meegan's review on this site. He expresses perfectly what I think of Antonio Forcellino ability, or rather lack of ability, to interpret the artistic soul, the genius of Michelangelo.",1316044800,,1232,4.433628318584071
8353128,5,B0026MOVNC,"I saw this remarkable work only recently on Public Television and was elated at the erudition with which the producers of this piece followed the research they impeccably revealed in communicating this fascinating aspect of the great artist's life. Their conclusions make perfect sense in terms of a realistic approach to the life of any human being, the changes that most human beings undertake in their lives, by the experiences they endure or relish to produce the final man or woman which may have traveled quite a long distance from that person they once were.

It would seem sour grapes to those who hold a specific view of religion and cannot abide any deviation from their own myopia.",1314057600,5,692,4.864406779661017
8353129,1,B0026MOVNC,"As an art historian and art restorer Antonio Forcellino has no idea what Michelangelo's work is all about.  Michelangelo's was an artist that devoted himself to symbolism on a grand scale, which he displays quite effectively in the Sistine Chapel that alluded the erudition of Antonio Forcellino.  This film is an INSULT to the memory and works of Michelangelo.

It amazes me that recent art historians think they know the works of Michelangelo but knows nothing of his work in esotericism, which he displays openly in the Sistine Chapel with the full knowledge and consent of the Catholic Church.

It is remarkable that these recent restorers find what are considered discrepencies in the artist's work and then look for some deviant reason for such variation from what is known.  The fact that a sculpture group can have pieces reshaped is a telling story because the message is in the collective group of sculptures not in a single piece such as the MOSES.  This same technique is found in the first chapter of Genesis esoteric writings and on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel fresco.  Modern day art historians and restorers have not the wherewithal to understand the great esoterists of the Renaissance.

Antonio Forcellino has made an utter FOOL out of himself and let this be a lesson to other wannabe interpreters of Michelangelo's works.  Get your facts straight and learn the art of symbolism before even THINKING of interpreting a work of art.",1259798400,6,1455,4.930327868852459
8353130,2,B0026MOVNC,"This documentary argues that Mike altered sculptures to signify his displeasure with the Catholic Church's leaders.  Mike wanted worshippers to remain Catholic, but thought the Church should change with the times.  Usually, I love when folk can interpret literature, art, or filmd deeply.  I'm thinking about what the film ""The Door in the Floor"" says about its title.  People liked ""The DaVinci Code"" for the same reason.  However, I wasn't convinced that this was proof, only theory.  The work never says that it's speculative.  The work also tells the viewers little about Mike's biography.  There is intrigue here.  This did make for good historical and political drama.  I just worry that it's just a house of cards.",1249171200,5,721,5.085470085470085
