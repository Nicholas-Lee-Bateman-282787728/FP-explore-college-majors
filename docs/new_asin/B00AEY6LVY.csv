8550710,5,B00AEY6LVY,We have turned Donkey Ollie into 13 weekly shows airing worldwide on television weekly. This is our first two episodes which were done nearly 9 years ago. The animation is a bit claymation looking which is what we were trying for at the time. The voice track is original and was never altered from the 1988 recording done in Phoenix Arizona with the original Donkey Ollie cast.,1371168000,,377,4.641791044776119
