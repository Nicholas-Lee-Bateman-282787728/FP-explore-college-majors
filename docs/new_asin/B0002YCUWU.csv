2145026,5,B0002YCUWU,"'Round about eight years ago I purchased the book and the companion two videos by Ken. I had played at banjo for many years and when great teachers became available through video I started with Ken's set. Today you can get the DVD versions and have a less frustrating time because of the non-linear access. I had limited exposure to tablature as there really was not much around for any styles of banjo.
I guess one could learn much by the DVDs alone but the method was built on page by page coordination with the book. By fully learning the examples before going too much further beyond the technique being covered, I learned tab by working at it. It is also important to listen to much, much of the style you are going after. There are many outlets currently available by simple a stroke of the keyboard.
Ken Perlman's method is the one I would strongly recommend to anyone starting out to learn clawhammer banjo, as it does go on into more interesting studies without changing the momentum of finding another teacher or special media etc. After Ken's program I would suggest Ben Holt. He has two DVDs to build repertoire and ""shading"" of the song. IF someone just cannot get tablature, Muphy Henry's ""Clawhammer 1&2"" by Lynn Morris is Great! get them any way.
Summary: Ken's study system of book work and careful slow example of the music is second to none. The only comment I would make is the video technique is dated and the picture of the tree behind him looks like he has a branch out the ear, but that does not take away from the value of a professional teacher and performing musician of three decades truly wanting to share his earned expression of this American tradition. To progress you must work.",1233964800,27,1711,4.576547231270358
2145027,2,B0002YCUWU,"I thoroughly enjoyed it (reading and watching the dvd) - except that it was more than I bargained for (total rank beginner) - (plays other instruments and composer)
I had no experience reading tab, and the gradiant was confusing - plus instead of tuning it and staying in one key for a few songs, each tune presented was in a different tuning -
These are also complete arrgs. by Ken - What I needed were single line  melodies, (I'm a fiddler) that I could play as I heard them -

Just lost interest, mainly because was not at his level of competence -
plus could not get at that time the basic bum ditty stroke down -

however, I can see it's value when one is more comfortable with the mechanics of playing, and conversant with tab.",1233273600,11,733,4.335766423357664
8034803,5,B0002YCUWU,Excellent! No criticisms at all.,1513468800,,32,5.6
8034804,5,B0002YCUWU,"Quite a book.  I recommend, like I am sure others do, that you get the 2 DVD set which SHOWS you what the words in the book can sometimes only hope to explain.  My strategy with learning clawhammer was to buy a few different books and pick and choose, since any given long-winded and wordy explanation for some technique is not necessarily understood by all.  Also,the more ways you can think about something, the better you can show it to someone else, and thus the stronger your own awareness of the knowledge is.  I play guitar and piano and more, yet I think particularly with clawhammer, you have to ""manhandle"" the instrument by slapping your hands all over it, and when you discover sounds that you like, you remember how to approach them, and you just have to practice to repeat them with consistency.  After all, the first banjar player had to teach himself!",1505260800,,867,4.603896103896104
8034805,5,B0002YCUWU,Excellent method for clawhammer banjo. It guides you step by step from the basic to the more advanced techniques. I really noticed my progressive improvements in the first 3-4 mounths of daily study and practise. The book combined with the DVD is a huge source of old time tunes arranged and played in clawhammer style by a great musician and teacher such as Ken Perlman. In my opinion it is a definetively must have method for people interested in this style.,1487289600,,460,4.691358024691358
8034806,5,B0002YCUWU,Great for starter to intermediate clawhammer players.  It starts out slow and gradually progresses.  Buy the companion video if you plan to use the book.,1435881600,,153,5.08
8034807,5,B0002YCUWU,"Great book! Make sure that you also purchase  the CDs by Ken Perlman that are designed to augment the lessons in this book. Even though I have a banjo instructor, the CDs enhance my development immensely. While the videos are primitive, they are a necessary learning tool so that you do not fall into any bad habits in between lessons. I also recommend becoming familiar with other instructional clawhammer books. Multiple methods and ideas are also essential especially if this is the first string instrument that you are learning to play as it has been for me. But of course, if you are not a total newbie, perhaps the book will suffice.",1396828800,,639,4.705357142857143
8034808,5,B0002YCUWU,I have learned much with My Perlman's instruction. I am glad to have purchased this instructional book. There is a DVD that goes with this book and I hope to purchase that soon.,1358812800,,177,4.393939393939394
8034809,5,B0002YCUWU,"This is a great dvd, but be aware that it is not a stand-alone product.  Instead, Ken Perlman wrote a book on which the dvd is based with the same title (""Clawhammer Style Banjo"").  The book is also available on Amazon.

What the dvd provides is a video demonstration of each and every song and exercise in the book, plus some expanded explanations for how to hold the banjo, position the fingers, play a tricky part of individual songs, etc.  It would be hard to learn the songs only from the DVD because you would need the tablature in the book that shows where to position the fingers.  Used with the book, however, it is like having a huge number of lessons from a top instructor for a comparatively very cheap price.  The video is about 4 hours with a large portion of that consisting of the actual exercises and songs as opposed to fluffly background talk.  In other words, it is chock full of content.

I have purchased a number of clawhammer banjo books at this point.  This little ""intro"" goes far beyond most of them in terms of taking you from simple clawhammer ""bum ditty"" strums to complex melodic runs and positions up the neck that are important for improvisation.  Follow this with Perlman's ""everything you wanted to know about clawhammer"" book as an encyclopaedic follow-up and it is quite a large amount of useful material.

Highly recommended.",1328832000,12,1363,4.6375
8034810,3,B0002YCUWU,"The production values on this DVD make amateur porn look like Citizen Kane, but Ken Perlman is an outstanding player and excellent teacher. Anyone trying to sort out the mysteries of clawhammer banjo technique could do a lot worse.",1325808000,3,231,4.948717948717949
8034811,5,B0002YCUWU,This is a book for the long haul. It progresses to advanced techniques from the basics.  I've been referring back to this book for a few years now.,1284422400,3,147,4.25
8034812,4,B0002YCUWU,"After many years of guitar playing, and a few months of trying to learn bluegrass style banjo, I decided to try to learn clawhammer banjo.  I bought Ken Perlman's book and DVD, and started learning.  His method of teaching is pretty easy to understand, however, I am not a good source of info for this because of my background of knowing how to play the guitar, and previous banjo playing.  I advanced quite quickly in the DVD/book, I think due to that fact.  I know that you should buy the book too, if you buy the DVD.  The DVD alone is not enough to get the whole picture of what Ken is teaching you. The DVD starts off with quite simple material, then advances slowly to intermediate for a while, then quickly goes into quite advanced clawhammer techniques.  I was in the midst of the intermediate stage when I found a local teacher.  He was impressed with what I had learned so far, and said my technique was good.  So I guess I owe it to Ken Perlman for that!",1252195200,8,965,4.322222222222222
