5309654,5,B009AVC9Z4,I'm not sure what I can really say about this product other then it has 20 episodes of Samurai action. I think the theme song is kind of cool though. My kids love it....and I have to admit that it is a bit interesting to watch. :-),1354838400,,231,3.9361702127659575

5309692,5,B009AVC9Z4,"Okay. The only thing that I did not like about this set is the case. The 3 discs are stacked on one circle in the middle of the case. When I received it in the mail all three discs were dislocated and flailing about within the case. Luckily they still worked and were not scratched.
Now that that little rant is over this season was awesome. I actually ended up enjoying it more than I did when it was samurai. I also liked that there was a major twist that I never saw coming. I knew Jayden was keeping a secret but it I never suspected what it turned out to be. What I had in my head was completely different.
Great season. Bad Casing.",1490918400,,637,4.104

5309797,3,B009AVC9Z4,"This season was good , but unless Super Samurai is included , it's not a complete series . Also , why wasn't it explained how an interracial team of Rangers are descended from Japanese Samurai and why they live on an island that looks like but is not Japan ? I'm starting to think that the entire 2nd Saban Era is just plain stupid ; not stupid as in terrible , stupid as in no common sense/brainless .",1412899200,,402,4.166666666666667

5309862,5,B009AVC9Z4,"Many people aren't a fan of the Samurai series. I for one loved it. The cast is great and it was adapted from it's japanese counterpart well for it's target audience. This set comes with all 20 episodes of Super Samurai, the second part of Power Rangers Samurai. The packaging is done well and the disks artwork is great. The menu is also done well with the only problem being the menu music loops in odd places. The special features are minimal, we get a music video of ""Everyday Fun"" and a few inspirational segments from the rangers. It would have been nice for a preview hype of the new Power Rangers Megaforce considering it's December release. Overall a great package and great value and the visuals really pop on Blu Ray.",1359417600,,728,4.5227272727272725
5309863,5,B009AVC9Z4,"It's rare that I would buy ""Season 2"" before a release of ""Season 1"" just incase I end up with an incomplete set, however I took the jump under the impression that if anything, buying Season 2 would encourage Lionsgate that sales were high enough to back-track with a Season 1 release.  Unfortunately, a few months on, there is still no announcement of a Season 1 release or indeed a ""Specials"" release containing the six special episodes and other extras.  I have faith that we will see this soon though.

The product itself is fantastic. It's a shame other companies have decided against Blu-Ray in favour of overly expensive iTunes encodes.  The quality seems fine in my eyes but a few other people have mentioned that the encoding on the Vudu versions is better than the Blu-Ray. Luckily my eye for detail isn't that precise and it's good enough for me. It's just nice to have a ""set"", even if it is only half a season! :)",1359331200,6,926,4.526946107784431
5309864,4,B009AVC9Z4,The product is good but the brazilian quality of the box is much better than the american. The shipping process is very fast and the package comes very secure. I really liked. The Power Rangers Super Samurai [blu-ray] have a beautiful and amazing quality.,1358985600,,255,4.818181818181818

5309866,4,B009AVC9Z4,"Even though I would have liked to get Power Rangers Samurai before Super Samurai, this is a good start. The video is clear and crisp. Sadly, the audio is only stereo so I didn't get the entire range I was hoping for.",1358294400,,216,4.166666666666667
5309897,5,B009AVC9Z4,"My young brother-in-law loves the power ranger Samurai so purchasing this for Christmas was a no brained and he absolutely loved it! Glad
I found it!",1357603200,,149,4.769230769230769
5309898,5,B009AVC9Z4,This is a wonderful set that I 5 yr old is obsessed it. I don't have to worry about finding a new episode every 30 minutes unlike with the DVR.,1357430400,,143,3.8
5309899,4,B009AVC9Z4,This was a great season of power rangers and overall I would give it 4/5. As for the packaging.....well it was sub par. The case is presented with a beautiful outer sleeve. The case is the lowest grade of plastic possible and just feels cheap. The case is pretty thick so I was expecting dividers for the disc. Nope! They are stacked on top of eachother. On top of that they don't stay down seeing how this case was ment for at least 5 or 6 disc....not 3. This was EXTREMLY disappointing to me especially after the terrific job shout factory and timelife did giving us the seasons 1-7 box sets. The package gets a 2/5. I would still recommend this product but go with the blu ray version if at all possible.,1356825600,,707,4.323308270676692
5309900,5,B009AVC9Z4,"Considering the price, it's great! It provides over seven hours of entertainment for the kids. They might have seen many of the episodes but they don't mind seeing them over again. I would recommend the purchase to any fans of the Power Rangers.",1356825600,,245,4.72093023255814
5309901,5,B009AVC9Z4,received well before estimated delivery date and product was exactly as described. this season was better than the previous season.  if you are a fan of the power rangers you will love this,1356134400,,189,4.7272727272727275
5309902,3,B009AVC9Z4,"The show is amazing but once again they claim that it is the ""complete Season"" yet it lacks the Halloween episode - Trickster Treat & the Christmas episode - Stuck on Christmas. Also the discs come in a thick dvd case but are stacked on top of each other on a single pole. Horrible packaging choice. But at least the price for the dvd set was good at $19.96 so at least that way they didn't stick it to the fans. If they would release the last two episodes on a single set (yeah right) and go back and release a ""True Complete"" (meaning all the episodes) series One collection then i will be happy.",1355961600,,598,4.208695652173913
5309903,5,B009AVC9Z4,"My sons love the show. Good series and favorite PR theme so far. My sons also like the mighty morphin, time force, and ninja storm series.",1355875200,,138,4.346153846153846
5309904,5,B009AVC9Z4,"Great series but the DvD doesn't include the following two episodes:

Trickster Treat

or

Stuck on Christmas

The Dvd's are stacked which I don't like.",1355529600,14,152,4.96
5309905,4,B009AVC9Z4,"Alright, this is a simple review for the blu-ray version of this super samurai boxset. As expected, this series looks incredibly awesome on bluray! All 20 episodes of Super Samurai are on 3 discs, but sadly thats really it. The tv movie is not included, and hasn't seen a release as of todays date. The special features on this set are also lackluster. A Ranger Swarm video taken from i believe the licensing expo from last year is present, its a very short video features many past suited rangers.
The other feature is the training like a ranger featurette showing all 5 rangers doing specific exercise moves and theres another lil video that i can't even remember what it was, but its nothing special. I would of expected some behind the scenes videos or outtakes or interviews like the individual releases got, but nothing. Thats why I gave this release a 4 out of 5 stars. If you want a barebones release with awesome video quality, choose this bluray release, otherwise just stick with the dvd boxset to save you some dough.
Lionsgate, you really need to step up, where is power rangers samurai season 1? why wasn't a full 2 year boxset released? Will one be released? please add some better special features, make it worth our money!",1355443200,3,1239,4.662100456621005

The one thing that does bother me is that this so-called ""Complete Season"" is missing the two holiday specials: ""Trickster Treat"" & ""Stuck on Christmas."" And  ""Clash of the Red Rangers: The Movie isn't included as well. It doesn't make sense why they have to be purchased separately from the Complete Seasons. I also don't understand why they only had one slot for the three DVDs so that they have to be stacked on top of each other.
