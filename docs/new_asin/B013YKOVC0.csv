7380756,5,B013YKOVC0,"I LOVED this show! I've been a huge M Night Shyamalan fan for most of my life and was so thrilled with the way the show ran and kept me guessing. It makes me want to read the books now. A lot of people disliked the ending but I loved it, it was brilliant. It was so M Night and definitely forces you think!",1447632000,3,306,3.796875
7380757,5,B013YKOVC0,"Wayward Pines is a small, isolated town that is initially pleasing to the eye on the surface, but bizarre and very dangerous beneath. Matt Dillon as the lead is smart, perceptive and is fooled by no one. He's someone you can root for, a hero who takes charge of the situation instead of letting it control him. If you're looking for a series with plenty of surreal nods to Twin Peaks' (which the book's author grew up watching it's been reported) darker side, Wayward Pines is an excellent series for fans of dark drama, horror and mystery. Every episode began presenting one twist after the other. Loved it.",1446854400,,608,4.638888888888889
7380758,2,B013YKOVC0,"This was televised with a split season.  I loved the first half of the series so much that I bought the first book, devoured it, and bought the second and third books and devoured them.  Unfortunately, during the second half of the season, M. Night Shyamalan decided that he knew better, and he didn't.  The cast did an excellent job, but MNS should be drawn and quartered.  Please, please, please read the books.  If you have $16 to spend recklessly and you loved the books so much you are obsessed with them, then buy the DVD.

I am still glad I saw the series.  It's just that the MNS's take on it sort of butchered the message.  My husband adds "" watch the series, then read the books; it will be more satisfying in that order.""",1446854400,5,732,4.330882352941177
7380759,4,B013YKOVC0,"After seeing the hit summer series on Fox , I was advised to read the books based on it (Pines, Wayward and The Last Town, all by Blake Crouch), which I did. I found that the series started out pretty faithful to the books but veered away from that at some point.  The trilogy itself is engaging but very graphic, and what we saw in the series was mild in comparison to what was described in the books.  It also had many different situations (some fabricated for TV), similar but not the exact same characters; their traits and behaviors were  at variance; and perhaps the most dissatisfying aspect of all: the ending,  which was absolutely nothing at all like the book trilogy.  Perhaps if I hadn't read the books, I would have rated it 5 stars.

However, I will give it an A for the acting. Good cast which includes Oscar nominees Matt Dillon and Terrence Howard (who are reunited from another film they were in together, 2004's ""Crash""),  and Oscar winner Melissa Leo.  I'll admit that I forgot how good an actor Dillon was. In the lead role, he made you love Ethan Burke, a flawed but determined Secret Service agent on an assignment to locate  two missing  colleagues...but as a result, he himself ends up missing. After a near fatal auto accident, he discovers himself trapped in a small, idyllic but peculiar  town that harbors an unbelievable and frightening secret (as Terrence Howard's character Pope tells Burke: ""It's worse than you could ever imagine"").  In trying to escape, he discovers that secret.  While I was disappointed with the vast differences between the books and the series, it was a riveting and engrossing watch up until the last 10 minutes or so.

**UPDATE, 12/13/15: Just a few days ago, it was announced that Wayward Pines would have a Season 2 in 2016, due to its popularity this past summer. However, the cast will be different with new characters, so we'll see how they plan on proceeding from that point.",1446508800,17,1939,4.6647058823529415
7380760,1,B013YKOVC0,"I read the series Before watching the show. Loved the book so much! Suppose if I hadn't read it first, I'd have liked the tv show ok. The show didn't capture the terror and suspense the books did. Variances are to be expected when going from paper to screen, but way too much changed, and none for the better. Very disappointing.",1446336000,3,329,4.409836065573771
7380761,4,B013YKOVC0,"Great script, great acting and directing. Super production, but...
Once more the Americans reveal an unbalanced approach towards cruelty details and nudity in films. On one side, shooting and blood splattering are shown (in this series) in detail, but those ""abby"" creatures, who are naked, are never shown really naked: casual shadows always cover their butts or genitals, and they hush around at ultrasound speed - except, of course, when they are shown eating up their preys. In those cannibalistic scenes (at no ultraspeed), blood and meat fragments hanging out of their mouths are being shown in close-up, as if this would be less dangerous for the youth than showing, just for a second - in order to make those ""abbies"" appear more believable - just a pair of butts or a harmlessly dangling penis. This is American hypocrisy par excellence...",1445990400,2,848,5.0212765957446805

7380768,4,B013YKOVC0,"A surprise hit during the summer of 2015, ""Wayward Pines"" adapts elements from the first three books of Blake Crouch's series. While the series takes a departure from the book in places, the story, casting and production values are top notch. I was leery at first because M. Night  Shyamalan  was attached to the series and he had a number of misfires over the years after ""Unbreakable"" (and his films tend to rely too much on gimmicks rather than a solid narrative). Luckily MNS didn't write the script--Chad Hodges does a good job of hitting the high points of both books (although, again, there are departures from the novels including the age of some characters). Hodges keeps some of the best lines from the books.

Secret Service Agent Ethan Burke (Kevin Dillion) wakes up in the woods near a small town named Wayward Pines after a horrible car accident. Hospitalized after the accident, Burke feels that something is off about the town and checks himself out trying to retrieve his I.D. and get ahold of his office and his family. Ethan was assigned to find his former partner (Carla Gugino) when the accident occurred. When Ethan gets back into town and stops for something to eat, he receives a mysterious message on his bill from the bartender/waitress (Juliette Lewis)--""There are no crickets in Wayward Pines"". The address he is given by her for her home is an old, burned out house. Wayward Pines has many secrets hidden and Burke remains determined to discover them all. He also finds that the sheriff (Terrence Howard) to be less than helpful and quite menacing.

 Shyamalan does a nice job with the pilot episode and the series builds nicely from the solid roots of the first episode. The reveal occurs by the midway point of this 10 part series which works to the series advantage allowing the writers/producers/directors/cast to expand on the mystery behind the series. Featuring a terrific cast including Toby Jones, Reed Diamond, Hope Davis, Shannyn Sossamon and Melissa Leo.

Unfortunately this show hasn't been released on Blu-ray yet as Fox has chosen to only release the series of DVD. That's too bad because the series was made for high definition with great cinematography and beautiful location shooting in British Columbia. The series IS streaming in high definition.

The series looks extremely good on DVD and audio is strong as well. As I said, it's a pity that we didn't get a high def presentation of the series. The special features for those buying the Blu-ray are limited to two featurettes running about twenty minutes total--""Where Paradise is Home: A Style Guide to Wayward Pines"" and ""Creating A Mythology"" both of which are solid but a commentary track and deleted scenes would have been nice to have as well.

The first season of ""Wayward Pines"" is self contained with a conclusion. It's a well written, directed, produced and acted show. The second season, while interesting, isn't as strong as the first season but does have an interesting (if less than the first season) series of twists and turns as well.",1497830400,,3051,4.876447876447877

7380778,1,B013YKOVC0,"I wanted to watch this series because the books are amazing.  Unfortunately, this mess is incredibly miscast.  None of the lead characters have the right actor/actress portraying them.  Matt Dillon, terrible choice.  Shannon Sossamon, even worse choice.  Terrence Howard and Carla Guigino, while normally very talented, displayed atrocious acting skills here.  Juliette Lewis is miscast as Barbara.  She would have made a better Pam.  Melissa Leo is to old to play the character of Pam.  This is just another example of Hollywood completely destroying a tremendous series of books.

7380798,4,B013YKOVC0,"2 reason to start watching: [1] Matt Dillon, [2] there are no crickets in Wayward Pines.

Plenty of reasons to keep watching: Hope Davis, Toby Jones, Shannyn Sossamon, Melissa Leo, a serious trip down the rabbit hole, and oh yeah, it eventually turns into science fiction (or more accurately, science FICTION). Plus, I'll be darned if there isn't some philosophy within this script about the nature of a free society in the 21st century. ""Clear and Severe!""

It's inevitable that some will see parallels between Wayward Pines and Twin Peaks, yet this is a poor analogy due to the vast, boundless dissimilarities between the two. During the first episode, Wayward Pines felt like some kind of lame Stephen King bromide, but with each episode another blindfold gets torn off, redefining the rules. Wish I could tell you more, but it would be a shame to spoil anything. One thing's for sure: it's addictive as hell! If I had started watching on a Saturday instead of a Monday, I would have binged it all before the weekend was done.

It's true: too many of this story's aspects don't add up... but you'll feel better if you toss aside reason (including science) and roll with it. C'mon, live a little!

Would be great to own on Blu-ray, but it's currently over 3x the price of the DVD, and the [overseas] Blu-ray releases apparently have no extras beyond what the DVD offers :(",1465430400,4,1374,4.7125

7380802,2,B013YKOVC0,"Stopped watching at Disc 1.  I found it offensive that a protagonist was brutally murdered in plain sight, with blood.  Take note, filmmakers - you will lose a certain number of viewers whenever you make things too explicit or ruthless.  The story wasn't interesting enough for me to tolerate any more of that level of violence.

Normally I only watch rated feature films, so I have more warning about content I might wish to avoid.  In this case, a TV-14 rating is insufficient.  This would receive an R rating if submitted for review under the more consistent film rating system.  TV self-applied ratings are not trustworthy or reliable enough.  TV programming should all either be no higher than PG-13 level, or should have some sort of meaningful rating or warning label applied to the packaging.",1463616000,,800,4.874074074074074

I have not read the books, but I'm told the show was different than the books.

7380810,3,B013YKOVC0,"I haven't read the books, I saw the TV series only.  I enjoyed it, enough to buy the DVD set.

I was hoping to get better picture quality than my ""high def"" satellite provider broadcast (I've purchased DVD's that better their compressed signal before), but not this time.  The DVD picture is very ""flat"".  I've got the equipment to make a BD ""pop"", and make a DVD look its best.  This DVD doesn't cut it.

Also, extras consist of only two short featurettes.  Every other TV series I own has commentaries and/or more in-depth featurettes.

Summary: A good TV series, but subtract one star each for the ""flat"" picture quality and lack of extras.

Update: I purchased the French Blu Ray.  The picture quality is outstanding.  To my surprise, while the packaging was completely in French, when I played the discs everything came up in English: the menus were in English, and the audio defaulted to English (I have some German Blu Rays where the menus are in German, and I have to remember to change the audio to English).  Same short featurettes, so still lacking in extras, but the picture upgrade was worth the $, imho.

Update 2: I purchased the Kindle edition of the books and have started to read them.  I can immediately see why people would complain too much was changed.  But I still think Season 1 was fantastic - my mind has already been ""polluted"" with Season 2 :) - and Season 3 will be coming next summer, so I'm really getting the Wayward Pines experience in a whole different way - LOL!

There were too many logic problems, inconsistencies, to keep me interested after the main protagonist died. For instance, if Burke (the main protagonist) could climb out of Wayward Pines, the monsters (called Abbies) could have climbed in. But they didnt. When the door in the wall was open why didn't the monsters come in? And why didn't the monsters get into the bunker when the town was overrun the first time like they did the second time?

To me the series ended when Burke died. The show was about him trying to escape from Wayward Pines. He didn't make it.

I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989, Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Here are a few series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2024,5.25077399380805
