4851717,5,B005OASMLU,"The Little Rascals Collectors Edition - 88 Classic Uncut Episodes is a wonderful DVD of memories.  I purchased it because my mom who is 86 loves the Little Rascals.  I ended up purchasing one for my own collection.  The seller is awesome and shipping on took 3 days from the date of purchase.  Superfast.  Will definitely purchase from the seller again.  It has so many favorite memories of the little rascals especially the early days when spanky was a little boy.  It has some the classic episodes such as
Choo-Choo!-The little rascals switch places with orphans and get a free train ride....Free Eats-- a classic with Stymie and the fidgets, Night N Gales--Darla and the gang spending birthday with Mr. Hood and so many more.  You will ove this classic DVD of Rascal memories.",1340236800,,779,4.7611940298507465
4851718,5,B005OASMLU,"I purchased this product to replace my VHS Cabin Fever episodes. I am VERY pleased with the outcome. This DVD Collection is all the other reviewers said. Truly Uncut, and complete. All the episodes are as remembered. Some picture quality is not 100%, I'll give it a 90-95%.( I have a 60"" flat screen, the larger display seems less crisp. These are almost 70 yrs old, so I may be a bit picky.) Does not seem as clear as my Cabin Fever copies, but worth every penny spent. Funny, I did notice the order of play is almost Exactly the same as the Cabin Fever releases. ?? I will, However give the Sender/Merchant 100% plus!!! My order was placed on mid Thurs. afternoon and Bamm!! was in my mailbox Monday!! Can't get better than that! Another nice surprise was a bonus DVD that was included with this set ( Best of Abbott and Costello) sent by Lucille, the Merchant/Shipper. Was surprised to see she sent me a note to make sure all was as should be. Nice. If your a Rascals Fan this is the set to be had. If you have the chance, purchase this set, from this merchant. NO disappointments!!!!",1339545600,8,1087,4.3861386138613865

4851720,5,B005OASMLU,"I grew up watching Spanky, Darla, Alfalfa and the Gang. Watching them again after so many years was awesome!!!! I was pleasantly surprised as I watched all of their zany antics unfold in this neat and complete collection. .

This set is exceptional. It has very nice video quality and additional episodes that I did not find in any of the other sets. There were even a few episodes that I had never seen before. The episoides are indeed uncut and unedited and are exactly as they appeared in their original form.

It is a real bargain. If you want the best quality of what's available this is the one to buy.",1328313600,3,608,4.419642857142857

I have always enjoyed watching The Little Rascals since I was a child. I watched the entire set and they are exactly as I remember them. The price was very reasonable for that many movies (88) and the overall quality of this set (quality of the movies and packaging) is Excellent. I do not believe that you will find a better set even at a higher price.

4851734,1,B005OASMLU,"Amazon calls this ""88 classic uncut episodes.""  I haven't tried all 88 yet, but one episode, ""Spooky Hooky"" is severely cut.  The entire opening sequence is missing and the episode starts partway into the story, so you have absolutely no idea what's going on or why.  This is just inexcusable.  I have to assume that if one episode is butchered this way, others may also be butchered.  I also have to agree with other reviewers about the sound and picture quality, really really awful.  I guess I got taken.  I'm giving this collection one star, but if I could I'd give it a  minus 100.  This is plain and simply false advertising, a complete rip-off.

4851736,5,B005OASMLU,"I purchased this set from Amazon a few years back, my intention being to buy a better set the moment one was released. Hasn't happened yet; and, as it turns out, this collection is pretty good!

My biggest gripe is the lack of episodic continuity. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be any conscious decision towards the show order. One moment we have an adventure with Spanky and Alphalfa, immediately followed by a silent offering with Joe and Farina. If you want to enjoy the rascals growth as children and performers chronologically, this is NOT the set for you.

However, everything else is too notch. The shows appear to be complete, with all the original gags and jokes intact. After decades of Hal Roach's gem of a show being cut and edited beyond recognition by the politically correct, it's refreshing to have the laughs back where they belong. Classics like the ""Kid from Borneo"" sat unaired, shamefully gathering dust for far too long! It's in this collection, along with everything else. Fans can truly enjoy this collection as a time capsule of a younger America.

Many have complained about the DVD picture quality, but let's be reasonable! Some of these short films date back to 1930 or earlier; that's over 80 years old! For their age, they look and sound as you would expect. Some films have held up better than others, but they are all watchable. Perhaps half a dozen or so are heavy on the grain and weak on the sound; but that's a tiny amount when dealing with 88 shorts in total.

If you're nostalgic for the Little Rascals you watched while growing up, this set will satisfy you. Let's hope that someday very soon a proper, restored and chronologically correct offering is released. The bulk of the earlier silent shorts are still unreleased!",1506816000,3,1761,4.745098039215686

4851767,1,B005OASMLU,"I was sorely disappointed in this collection. On the plus side, the prints they selected are good - no bad splices, missing scenes, and the soundtrack is fine.  However, there are a lot of problems. The video transfer quality is poor. The image looks like it was transferred in a small format and then enlarged on a computer.  It's fuzzy and has visible lines. Even in VHS days this would have been unacceptable. The shorts are in a random order (I was expecting chronological). The DVD menus are clearly generated with home video software. The first part of each opening title sequence and the last part of each end credit sequence is cut off so you sometimes have no idea what the name of the short is. There are no gaps between the shorts, so playing all results in a sudden jarring switch from one short to another.  This collection is not suitable to add to anyone's permanent collection.",1487980800,,893,4.60377358490566

He likes to watch a couple programs with us when he visits, such as Happy Days , Laverne and Shirley, Andy Griffith and the old Westerns,
I had the little rascals on one morning in my sewing room and he came in to visit and got caught up watching them and was giggling and enjoying it very much so I decided to get it for him as a Christmas gift. He is Enjoying it on his weekends so far.

4851781,2,B005OASMLU,"Who doesn't love the Little Rascals?!!  I sure do, but I dislike this DVD set.  The quality is horrible.  I used to have a Laserdisc player and two volumes of the little rascals.  I tried to convert them to DVD, but I thought, well, they have it on DVD, I'll just buy that.  I had a whole bunch of them and the quality of the ones I had converted were WAY better than this DVD set!!  I regret getting rid of the set.

The quality of the picture is horrible.  I read a review in which the reviewer stated that they look great for 60 year old film.  Well, the Three Stooges Ultimate Collection is beautiful!!!  Here are my problems with this set:

PICTURE QUALITY:
1) Picture quality is substandard, played on today's Hi Def TVs.  You can see the sharp corners of the image when they tried to format the picture to a higher resolution.  It just looks REALLY bad
2) Images look a little fuzzy and unclear
3) The editing was horrible!!!  You don't even get the end of the credit of an episode and the next one starts
4) The menu system sucks.  Very bad

SOUND:
Sound, well, I can't tell, because the sound would've been horrible with today's standards than it was back then, so I forgive the sound

COST: Great price.

OVERALL:
I think over time I'll be okay with it.  But, it is a shame that this collection could not have been as clear and beautifully restored as the Three Stooges Ultimate collection. Until a much better one comes along, I'll stick with this one.  I don't want them colorizing them either.  That is a tragedy!!",1483315200,,1527,4.343971631205674

4851926,5,B005OASMLU,"I did not know what to expect before purchasing this Little Rascals collection but the price was reasonable so I figured why not.

It was a pleasant surprise to see The Little Rascals exactly as I remember them from my childhood. Nothing was cut out. The quality of the video and the sound was great considering the age of the films. The movies brought back many memories for my husband and me and many laughs for the entire family.

The box was exactly as pictured in the advertisement with very nice classic pictures of The Rascals on the front and back covers.

This set is well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an all inclusive, uncut Little Rascals Collection at a reasonable price.",1423008000,2,717,4.542635658914729
4851927,1,B005OASMLU,"A few months ago I purchased this set. The cost was over 30.00 with shipping.
The set was pretty good and well worth the money, at least I thought it was.
One day my sister came over while we were watching them and asked ""Where did you get them? I have not seen these in decades"".
When I told her I got them on Amazon she said ""I need to get a set for myself"".
Well she did. Only the set she purchased was not this set but another set with with a blue cover that was about $10.00 CHEAPER.
The next time I saw her she showed it to me. We watched some of the episodes together and the quality was just as good or better than mine.
I really felt taken.
So I am rating the set 1 Star. +5 stars for the movies and -4 stars for the price.
This is the set she bought.

4851966,4,B005OASMLU,"How wonderful it was to see these kids again after more than 60 years. I enjoyed every minute of every episode. Many others have denounced the Rascals as racist, I saw only kids doing what kids did in the 20's and 30's, and in many cases still do even today. These kids knew nothing of hatred for another race and they did indeed help one another and treat each other equally. I gave this four stars not because of the content or any problems with the quality, but by virtue of the fact that I feel they should have been done in chronological order with the silents at the beginning of the series instead of on the fifth disk. All in all however, this is an excellent collection--a glimpse into the early days of film. Definitely worth the price of admission.",1412985600,,759,4.390070921985815

This set has hours and hours of Little Rascal entertainment. I really enjoy watching good clean fun. It is amazing how far our society has gone moved from these days - from the corporal punishment of those days to the ""twerking"" of these days, things have certainly changed.
The video quality of this set is in the definition of the day. Certainly not High Definition, but adequate if you are not sitting too close to the screen.  The audio quality comes and goes on my set. Maybe it is my Blue Ray player, but there are times when I get some loud popping and the audio just goes away.

The innocent plots/stories are aimed at the young uns but the oldies get a hoot out of them as well; the facial expressions on these young actors and the voices on some of them (eg Buckwheat) are priceless; the dog is very talented also.

4851999,1,B005OASMLU,"I bought this based on my love for ""Our Gang"" & ""The Little Rascals"" comedy shorts, and while this collection does have 88 episodes...the picture quality is so bad that it's almost unwatchable!!!  The source for those '88 episodes' must be from a very poor old VHS Tape, as the images are horrible.  I have a blu-ray player that upconverts DVD's to near Blu-Ray quality images...but here the image quality is so bad that it's impossible to view on my 42 inch HDTV...and the same is true using a small 22 inch HDTV...so BUYER BEWARE!!!  Words don't express how disappointed I was when I tried to watch these classic masterpieces where these were cheaply and poorly reproduced.  If you like large lines running through all scenes with images 'stair-stepped' so the images are at an old, outdated 'analog level' of really low resolution, then this set is for you, IF you expect and demand that a product is at least at a DVD resolution level, then this set isn't even close and you will be really, really disappointed in this bad quality collection.  Others who reviewed this same collection and gave it a 5 Star rating, are either blind or they are willing to settle for a truly inferior product.  Maybe my set was a mistake, but the seller didn't respond to my complaint so maybe the seller is the one who's making these bogus glowing reports about how great a set this is when it appears that it is trash.  I am now stuck with a really bad 'collection' that I can't return (partially because I waited several months before I opened and tried to watch this junk...and partially because the seller wouldn't respond to my U.S.P.S. letter).  I buy, watch and then donate a lot of DVD movies to my local Portland, Oregon (Multnomah County) Library Association...but this set is so bad and so unwatchable that my only option is to find a garbage outlet that will recycle this unusable product and maybe make it into something else that can be used.  This is complete junk so save yourself from throwing your money away.  There are other same/similar collections, and the one my library has is actually of decent quality...so avoid this one at all costs.",1400976000,10,2147,4.656084656084656

The negatives I have are that the sound quality in spots is poor, maybe that is also unedited.  The other negative is a minor one, but there doesn't seem to be any order in which the episodes were put on the DVD.  In some ways that is reminiscent of how I used to see them on TV, but if I want to see a specific episode, I would have to actually know its title, something to which I never paid attention.

When I say ""packaging"", I refer to anything and everything besides the films themslves, from the liner notes to the box it came in.  The cover and disc art look like they could have been done by a middle schooler.  The box is the industry standard black plastic 6-disc holder available just about anywhere, incuding Amazon.  The DVDs come with cheesy menus and no extra features whatsoever, plus the MGM ""roaring lion intros"" have been cut off.  There are no liner notes. Other than a list of the films, a single photo, and a brief description of the contents within, the cover is completely unadorned.  Now that that's out of the way, this set is well worth the twenty-five bucks or so I spent.  The film quality and completeness of the set are apparently unrivaled.  There are films here that are not included in my Cabin Fever VHS collection.  It even includes a bizarre where-are-they-now interview with the Mickey-Joe-Farina gang.  This set is what I would call a high quality bootleg, along the lines of my copy of Disney's Song of the South and Jimi Hendrix's Maui Concert.

These DVD-Rs are crammed with too many episodes per disc. The bit rate barely gets 2.2 mbps making the picture look cruddy and ruddy. This may fly on a 32"" television, but not on a big HDTV. I am even playing these on an Oppo BDP-103 and they still look bad. There is nothing wrong with my player or set and I know how old these episodes are, but this is 2013 and there are decent prints out there. A friend has the silver box set from Genius and they look pretty good (with a much higher bit rate) but I was being cheap and wanted to save a few bucks. Well this set will be sold and I plan on getting the silver box set from a legit studio where the DVDs are pressed and not burned. Wish I knew the truth about this set before purchasing. It was a gamble I should not have taken. Because I love me some Rascals and they deserve much better than this set. This is one step better than VHS copies.",1373932800,16,1045,4.053140096618358

However, Buyer Beware : many of these DVDR products were mastered from VHS.

Note also that there's only 87 episodes, rather than the 88 claimed.
One short is duplicated on the 88-episode editions.
Presumably all 87/88 episode Rascals discs are Cabin Fever knock-offs.

At one point this was the best you could get, but
the newer Vivendi discs are apparently the difinitive versions of the 80 Roach talkies.

It came timely and even included a bonus dvd of vintage movies.  As for the collection, it came secure in its packaging, was excellently priced for the amount of content on each dvd, was not ""restored"" but the prints/negatives used were very clean (I'll leave any more specifics to the experts), and they are in random order.  To those who've never seen the uncut Rascals, there is use of blackface, use of the term ""colored"", etc. but they are of their time and not meant to be demeaning -- these kids genuinely got along on and off the screen.  I was surprised that I was able to make out the plots in some of the cut versions on TV because of what was cut.  For example, Spanky tries to sneak past the gang disguised as Buckwheat (the episode where he was made the gang's treasurer) in blackface and I remember seeing the rest of that short and that was a nice 5-8 minutes out of a 20-25 minute short.  The titles go one into the other without any leadup to the title card so that may seem abrupt.

I hope that this has shown you that COLLECTING match-boxes is probably easier.

Save your money... or SPEND it. I can certainly SEE the difference on a 55"" screen. If you have a 40 -- or less -- probably won't matter,
much.

Don't even get me started on the thousands of dollars I spent on THE THREE STOOGES. Now you can get EVERYTHING ""Stooges"" -- even a few extra
movies AND shorts [for $50] with:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-The-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B006WN5W5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection</a>. Yes! Includes the 3-D Three Stooges Shorts from back in the '50s;
in 3D or 2D.
3-D Glasses are included.

Enjoy!
Sincerely Yours,

4852068,5,B005OASMLU,"Exactly as described and FAST FAST shipping!
These DVD's contain all of the Hal Roach Talkie period Our Gang shorts and 8 silent episodes. Also included is a TV appearance from 1953 featuring a reunion of Silent Era Our Gang alumni.
The sound and picture quality was not perfect but was much better than I had expected and much better than they looked on TV when I was a kid in the 70's.  All the episodes are unedited and feature the original Our Gang title cards.
You cannot ask for a better deal than this if you are a fan of the Rascals!",1357171200,,541,4.252427184466019

4852071,5,B005OASMLU,"I used to watch little rascals all the time when I was a kid (no, I'm not that old), years later my brother bought a dvd set that did not have all the episodes I remembered, but a lot. I figured some of them were just lost in time or there was some odd reason why they didn't make the cut. But this set has those episodes and more! I'm very happy with this collection and think it's a must have for anyone who even ""kinda"" likes the little rascals to the nostalgic fans like me.",1351728000,,478,3.9895833333333335
4852072,5,B005OASMLU,"This is the best collection of classic videos I have ever seen. They look exactly as they did when I watched them as a child over 50 years ago. My grandchildren love watching them. I find this amazing since they will not watch anything else in black and white. I give this set a solid five stars for the quality of the video, the price and naturally the content. In my humble opinion, this set is an absolute gem and I strongly recommend it.",1347494400,2,441,4.261904761904762

4852075,5,B005OASMLU,"This is the best Little Rascals collection I`ve ever seen.  True to it's word - it's uncut and there are some parts that I`ve never even seen on TV.
If you have to buy a Little Rascals DVD - this is the absolute best of them all.
Others in the past were not as good as this one as they were edited and censored beyond belief, totally ruining them.
I highly recommend getting your hands on this one before it dissapears!!!",1342137600,19,421,4.197530864197531

8481138,4,B005OASMLU,Pretty amazing that this is on dvds. They work great. The quality is very low. I know that little rascals was made forever ago when cameras were terrible but I think they could have done more video editing to make it better. But its really awesome to watch it now:) we sit at our ranch house drinking with this on in the background. Lots of laughing. Like the old days.,1523404800,,369,4.285714285714286
