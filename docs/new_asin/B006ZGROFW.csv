8632469,3,B006ZGROFW,"The story plods along. It's a bore between D/S scenes. There's no timeline reference, so impossible to know how long it's supposedly take to transform from an insecure girlfriend to a dominatrix vigilante, but the idea is laughable. Still, she looks great in her catsuit.",1385942400,,271,5.044444444444444
8632470,3,B006ZGROFW,"I found this story interesting but also a little disappointing.  The plot involves a girl who years later uses sessions dominating people to murder those who killed her father.  Overall, the story seemed a little thin and a lot less titillating that such a story line might at first indicate.  While I liked the fact that the domination scenes were treated as a natural part of the story, I found that they were rather brief and seemed almost an afterthought.  Also, the only such scenes in the movie were those where she exacted her revenge.  Was she really a dominatrix, or just using it as a cover to access people when they were vulnerable?",1376092800,,644,4.614035087719298
8632471,2,B006ZGROFW,There is no story of a dominatrix! I expected scenes of true domination.  There were only a few short scenes of her dressed like a dominatrix and only 1 scene where she acted like one for a short period of time.  It is a story of revenge and murder.  Not a dominatrix.,1359072000,4,268,4.115384615384615
8632472,2,B006ZGROFW,"Abby (Rebecca Larson) is shy and psychotic. She breaks up with men before they can break up with her...so there! She has film of her father who was killed by a dominatrix. She goes after all of those involved by dressing as a dominatrix.

This movie is also marketed under the title ""Justify"" and ""Sweet Karma"". Abbey gets close to the dominatrix by getting involved with a portrait painter (Jaret Sacrey) and his model the dominatrix Victoria (Heather Lemire).

I found the film to move slow. You really don't care for Abby who is aloft and is her own worse enemy. You don't really get to know her because you don't care to know her. The camera work was fairly bad as it had a lot of unnecessary movement, i.e. not mounted but hand held. I am not sure what the effect should be other than annoying. Even with a strong sexual theme, I found things rather boring in between the times Abby wasn't wearing her outfit.

There are better kinkier films. Lipstick, 9 1/2 Weeks, or anything with Lucy Lui or by Russ Meyers.

8632473,4,B006ZGROFW,"I liked this movie! It wasn't what I expected. I thought it was going to be a film with so much erotic sex scenes that the story was going to be lost. Many movies that deal with sex don't use it in the right way, the film starts to lose sight of their plot and just turn into something else. A Dominatrix Story has enough s&m to push the story along and that's it. I really think that it should have a different name to give you better understanding of what the film is about.

Rebecca Larsen did a great job acting. She was very believable. Misstress Victoria was a good character too. The movie had me going through different emotions, at times the film was sad, funny, and sentimental. The only thing I didn't like was sometimes the camera angles were a bit off. I'm not a filmmaker so I don't know, but it just seemed strange. Anyway, the story-line is good and it's something to check out.",1336348800,4,894,4.289940828402367
