4534275,5,B0053O8AQE,"This is not only my favorite new comedy of the season; it is the best sitcom currently on. I have to add something to the previous comment about the characters and message of the show. Max has always been working class and was resigned to her fate. To make extra money she took a second service job as a baby sitter. Caroline knows there is a better life out there, and is determined to recover it. She sees Max has a talent for baking cupcakes. Caroline has the spirit of enterprise and is taking Max upward; from working for others to starting their own business. That is the positive message of the show. At the end of each episode there is an accounting of where the girls are in their quest to raise the capital needed to get their enterprise launched. Still, I watch the show for Kat Dennings and her provocative dialog. The show is a success. I hope the writers understand why and don't change course.",1338768000,,908,4.410714285714286
4534276,5,B0053O8AQE,"The gutter-talk is what I love about this show!!!!!!

I liked the writing and the characters until, and thought it was a good solid show until the middle of the first episode when Caroline accused Max of crying.  Max staunchly defends herself by claiming she was masturbating.

It feels natural and realistic to me.  My girlfriends and I talk like that all the time!  My stoner friends talk about drug use.  And we've had long discussions about the importance of the relationship between a woman and her vibrator.  Hell, I've accused a friend of making a penis when it had been a while for her, and all of the foods she ""invented"" were strangely phallic-shaped.

I like having a TV show that actually talks about the realities of being poor, single, and female.  You don't have time to be ""dainty.""  When you are around your friends you open up and you are honest like that.

Of course it's an exaggeration--it wouldn't be funny if it weren't.  It would just be sad.

But because they are willing to ""Go there,"" this show won my respect.  It's not for children.  So be it.",1336435200,5,1072,4.539267015706806
4534277,5,B0053O8AQE,Absolutly one of the best comedies on TV today. Never fails to make me laugh out loud. I've turned my friends onto this show and they also LOL. This show is a must see for all adults of all ages who enjoy a truely funny comedy. My only wish is that this weekly show (on CBS mondays)was an hour long. Watch it once and you'll be a fan yourself.,1333843200,2,343,3.9855072463768115
4534278,5,B0053O8AQE,"For someone who normally doesn't watch tv, this fun and sassy show have become one of my all time favorites. The comedy, although can be pretty raunchy, is still funny as hell to the point where you don't care if it's offensive or not. Every character is hilarious, memorable, and has their own interesting personality. The relationship between the two main characters is both funny and even sweet. Each episode had me laughing my ass off, and it's become the thing I look forward to every Monday night.

What else can I say? I loved this show!",1329782400,3,544,4.608247422680412
4534279,5,B0053O8AQE,Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs are hilarious in 2 Broke Girls. Comic Gold. I definitely will be buying the first season when it comes out.,1326931200,4,135,4.44
4534280,4,B0053O8AQE,"Even in unfortunate situations like the recent scandals that have rocked Wall Street, and affected the future of millions of investors, there are opportunities to create humor.  Created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, CBS's 2 Broke Girls, is a comedy set in New York City featuring two women from completely different ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, who come together as coworkers, only because one has lost her fortune, due to her father's involvement in a financial scandal.  This is a well-cast show with pretty good writing, but it is often a little too crude than it needs to be, with frequent references to sex, drugs, and crime.

The series stars Kat Demmings as Max Black, a waitress in a small restaurant in Brooklyn.  She's street smart, a little hardened and cynical, and has a bit of a gutter mouth, but underneath that rough and crude exterior, there's a warm caring person.  Beth Behrs is Caroline Channing, a slim blonde beauty who bears more than a passing resemblance to Paris Hilton.  Caroline's father Martin was convicted and sent to prison for his involvement in a financial scandal (think Bernie Madoff).  In the process, the Channing family's financial assets were frozen, leaving Caroline locked out of her luxury apartment, and denied access to her rather substantial trust fund.

The setup for the series is established in the first episode, as a desperate Caroline becomes a waitress at the Williamsburg Diner.  Owner Han Lee (Matthew Moy) hires Caroline, teaming her with Max, who is less than enthusiastic with being saddled with someone with zero experience.  Also in the restaurant are Oleg (Jonathan Kite) a cook who sexually harasses the girls, and Earl (Garrett Morris, the venerable SNLer) the lovable cashier.  With no place to live, Max invites Caroline to stay in the apartment that she currently shares with her boyfriend, but after catching him with another woman, Max kicks him out, and Caroline becomes her new roommate.

Much of the humor is based on the obvious and pronounced differences between the two girls.  The contrast between the women's attitudes extends far beyond just economic matters, and provides many comic opportunities for the writers.  The writing is generally sharp edged, creative, and pretty clever, although presumably to appeal to a younger audience, heavily infused with vulgarity.  The sexual innuendo is frequently at the gutter level, when it really doesn't need to be.

Both lead actresses are well cast, and do a nice job of immersing themselves into their characters.  Kat Demmings (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-Norah-s-Infinite-Playlist/dp/B001PNV9FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist</a>, Thor) brings to Max, a realistic working class toughness, surly attitude, a body loaded with ample curves, and often delivers her lines with a cynical scowl.  Behrs has good comic instincts, to go along with a model's figure, and the stereotypical airhead chick voice she employs.  Caroline is a cartoonish character, who sometimes seems semi-detached from reality.  A graduate of Wharton business school, Caroline is particularly bright when it comes to financial matters, and applying her academic rich girl sensibilities to real world situations, is one of the foundations of the program's humor.

While the differences between the Caroline and Max establishes a baseline, it is the things that they share in common, and the mutual experiences that bond them together, that makes the show interesting, and gives it some warmth as their friendship grows.  One common interest they share early on, is Caroline's horse Chestnut, who is kept in the backyard of Max's apartment.  The big thing though is their business partnership, as the ladies plan to make a successful business from Max's talent for baking cupcakes.  At the close of each episode, the running total of their financial assets is updated.

The characters Han, Oleg, and Earl, are a bit racially stereotyped, and as the season progresses only Oleg really assumes a more significant role.  To perk things up, late in the season the writers introduce Sofi Kachinsky (Jennifer Coolidge), a mysterious woman who lives upstairs in the same building as the girls.  Another ethnically influenced character, Sofi is from Eastern Europe and runs a cleaning service.  Sofi becoming romantically involved with Oleg, provides another bridge between the girl's private life, and the things that happen at work.  The voluptuous Jennifer Coolidge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ExTerminators/dp/B0040BJH36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ExTerminators</a>) is an experienced actress, whose presence strengthens the program, while creating more opportunities for the writers.

With a talented and funny cast, 2 Broke Girls is clearly a series with much potential, however the writing exhibits a fixation with profanity, sexual innuendo, and double entendre, that seems to increase as the season progresses.  Even if an increase in vulgarity contributes to the program's popularity, CBS isn't a cable network, and not sinking into the gutter too often, may in the long run, result in the show reaching a larger audience.  The hilarious season finale, which features a guest appearance by Martha Stewart, is absolutely fabulous, and demonstrates that a little more class, and a little less crass, might be a winning approach for this very entertaining program.",1319328000,39,5497,5.491686460807601
4534281,5,B0053O8AQE,"After an awkward attempt with 'Outsourced' the small screen returns with another sitcom involving the economy. This time, they get it right.

This CBS sitcom examines how two 'different' young women attempt to make ends meet  in the current American economy. Max (Kat Dennings) has always been working class, but poverty is a new and really unpleasant surprise for Caroline (Beth Behrs). She had been rich, until her family lost all of it's money from dad's ponzi scheme.

The odd-couple friendship successfully works because they are both genuinely likable characters. They are both discovering what the world is currently like while struggling in a low-paying service sector job. This is where the storylines and comedy comes in.

Caroline is gennuinely shocked to discover what a 'public dental clinic' looks like. Or some people must delay obtaining their needed treatment altogether until pain is intolerable. But she proactively realized that selling off her massive wardrobe will bring in lots of needed money for the two roomates to live on. She had already started thrift shopping at the local Goodwill.

Viewers have watched a 'struggling young roommates' storyline many times before but the creators and writers artfully balance out comedy with economic-political reality here. Timely storylines are entertaining.

Becoming low-income is something she had never expected, Caroline is however most challenged when a former boyfriend unexpectedly comes to the dinner where she now works. Having somebody from her former world now seeing her current situation is embarrassing: The rich are not expected to 'work' because of economic wealth and what it means. She however survives to tell the tale. And she discovers real friends like her for who she is, not for how much money she has.

Watching this sitcom, I could not help but feel that I was being visited by the ghost of Norman Lear. The 'issue' writing and the character development are that well tuned on current issues without loosing the comedy. It is definitely something which everybody--and not just girls--are going to like watching.",1318377600,30,2104,5.244047619047619

4534671,5,B0053O8AQE,"This is one of my favorite shows!  I tried watching it when it first came out but I could never remember to watch it and kept forgetting to record it.  I finally forgot about it.  I came across the show again in reruns and fell in love with it again.  I tried recording the reruns but wasn't able to watch the show in order so I purchased the seasons up until current to watch on my Amazon Fire Stick.

This show isn't for everyone.  The humor can be pretty dark at times.  The humor can also be offensive to overly sensitive people.  Yes, they make some jokes based on race, sexual orientation, religion, and anything else that can be made fun but it's not over the top and they make fun of everyone, not just specific groups.

The story line is about 2 young girls living day to day.  Both girls are from two different walks of life.  They each were raised in different environment and come together by fate... or well TV entertainment fate.  Carolyn was raised by her father who was rich but it turns out he was stealing from people through a Ponzi scheme.  He was arrested and Carolyn lost everything and everyone.  Carolyn is very optimistic and upbeat.  Max was raised by her mom and never knew her dad.  Her mom was a bad mother.  Max is used to disappointment and being in debt.  Carolyn put in an application at a diner that Max worked at and their friendship started from there.

Carolyn discovers that Max bakes amazing cupcakes.  Carolyn, being her optimistic self, comes up with a business plan for them.  Carolyn went to Wharten and studied business.  She estimates how much money they need to start their business and their attempts to reach that goal start.

Each episode they're trying to make money while facing emergencies that come up.  They work in the diner and have a wonderful relationship with their coworkers, Han, Earl, and Oleg, as well as the Polish lady who lives above them, Sophie.  Carolyn managed to keep her horse, Chestnut.  They manage to keep him in the backyard of their apartment building which is entirely unrealistic but it still is a fun store line.

The story line is a bit far fetched but if it were realistic it would be really boring and depressing.  The jokes are hilarious and Kat Dennings really fits her role.  She executes her jokes perfectly and makes them even funnier.  Beth Behrs isn't as a great as Kat Dennings with her jokes but it works well with her character's personality.

I'm really enjoying seeing the girls grow.  I like that they face hardships often like the rest of us do who can't afford to buy our way out of things.  While they do manage to make it through most of their hardships there are times when that doesn't happen and they're back at square 1.",1465603200,,2724,4.493877551020408

4535229,3,B0053O8AQE,"2 BROKE GIRLS is an above average TV series.  It starts off slowww but the episodes improve because the characters tend to grow on you.  That is until ""The Homage to Judaism"" rears its ugly head.  Note that Kat Dennings is the best thing about 2 BROKE GIRLS [also check her out in the movies CHARLIE BARTLETT and DEFENDOR] and that this actress comes from a Jewish family.  The insider joke of the episode is that the Jewish women in the episode keep saying to the Jewish Kat Dennings ""You are just like looking in a mirror!""  The joke is pretty good, but the sentiment isn't.  Jews think of themselves as a BIOLOGICAL race apart.  ""The Chosen People"" prioritize their ""alleged"" biological difference with Gentiles over their religious differences.  ""Really,"" you may say, ""such anti-Semitism!""  No, REALLY.  Check out the Jews proudly documenting their genocidal killings of Gentiles all over the Old Testament [See the ""heroic"" Moses presiding over the genocide of the Midianites in Numbers 31:14-18.  The Midianites don't whine about THEIR Holocaust, do they?  Why not?  Because the Jews are NOT a bunch of half-assed Nazis.  The Jews got 'em all.]  Why didn't their egregious killing of Gentiles conflict with their Commandment against Killing?  Because that Commandment doesn't apply to mosquitoes, barnyard animals, or Gentiles.  Jesus' ministry against Hypocrisy should have targeted this anti-Gentilism, but Jesus never mentioned it.  Except.  EXCEPT to SPECIFICALLY & EMPATHICALLY exclude Gentiles from his message and ministry in Matthew 10:5.  Jesus lived and died a good Jew.  As for the Muslims they are a totally murderous bunch [See Quran 48:29, 9:5, 2:191-193, 4:89, 8:39, 47:35 etc.etc and, since ""Allah"" recommends LYING to infidels in Quran 9:1 & 3:28, there are NO ""moderate"" Muslims--just moderately good Muslim LIARS] but the reason Muhammad thought Jews would flock to his Version 3.0 of YHWH is because it was so in tune with the murderous Deuteronomy 7:2-3 & 13:6-15 which Jews MUST follow FOREVER as mandated in Deut. 29:29.
Think of Matthew 10:34, but don't ""think"" too hard--the first two words say it all, ""Think not.""--Jesus wasn't kidding.  So am I an anti-Semite that thinks that murderous, mutually-exclusive, monotheistic, monomaniacal ""god"" YHWH/Jehovah/Allah should be murdered in His sleep?  Not at all.  YHWH/Jehovah/Allah doesn't exist anymore than do Invisible Pink Unicorns [See Steve Eley in The Quotable Atheist].  INVISIBILITY is the key concept here.  Horus [born of a Virgin on December 25th, baptized, had 12 Disciples and raised Lazar from the dead], Mithras [also born of a Virgin on December 25th; December 25th was the pagan High Holiday of the Winter Solstice--about 3 dozen Middle Eastern gods were born on the Winter Solstice], Wodin, Easter, Zeus, Brahma, Coyote & Jesus, none of these ""gods"" ever existed, and the quality that they all share is INVISIBILITY.  This episode of 2 BROKE GIRLS gives us the DISNEY VERSION of a blood-thirsty religion that propagates itself, as admittedly ALL religions do, by brainwashing young children in order to get new ""converts"".  This brainwashing is Child Abuse.  And this episode is about the on-going Child Abuse of BAR MITZVAH!!
Now why should you believe me when I say ""Religion is Child Abuse""?  You shouldn't but you might give some credence to Thomas Edison when he says, ""The great trouble is that the preachers get the children from 6 to 7 years of age, and then it is almost impossible to do anything with them.  Incurably religious--that's the best way to describe the mental condition of so many people.  Incurably religious.""  This religious BRAIN-WASHING causes permanent brain-dam[n]age.  ANY True Believer reading this will automatically and ""Unconsciously"" [See The USER ILLUSION by Tor Norretranders] dismiss what I've just written because as Jonathan Swift pointed out, ""It is useless to attempt to reason a person out of what they were never reasoned into.""  Here's a simple test of how much your reasoning may have been compromised [i.e. ""brain-dam{n}aged""] by religious brainwashing:

  No, I don't believe in God.  I'm not a moron.  I have to have some proof of something.

If you're a religious True Believer, the above statement by Harlan Ellison, makes no sense.  It's total drivel.  But here's a quote from Sam Harris which helps explain what Jonathan Swift noted above:

  Tell a devout Christian [or any other religious True Believer] that his wife is cheating on him, or that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible,
  and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else, and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it.  Tell him that the book
  that he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the
  universe, and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever.

That's what I mean by the brain-dam[n]aging effects of religious BRAINWASHING.  But how can I communicate this to a Brain-dam[n]aged True Believer?  Well, I have some hope that, where reasoning automatically fails, this analogy may pierce the blind Faith of a True Believer:

  Say, for instance, you come across a priest raping a little child between 6 to 7 years of age.  As you attempt to drag the priest off the child,
  the priest justifies his rape by saying he did it out of ""Love"" and that he had the child's best interest at heart.  Would you buy this argument?
  It gets worse.  Say this wasn't the first instance of the priest raping this child.  Say that the priest had raped this child many times, and that
  this child's repeated exposure to the ""Love"" of the rapist priest had ""converted"" this child to the priest's point of view.  Say that, as you
  drag the priest away, the child starts hitting YOU in the priest's defense?  Would you say that the child was expressing Free Will?  Would
  you excuse the rape because it was done with ""Love""?  Or because it was done with the child's best interest at heart?  Would you tolerantly
  say, just to be ""fair"", that the ""good points"" of Child Rape should be taken into account?

How can Child Rape have any ""good points""?  How can brain-washing & brain-dam[n]aging little children have any ""good points""?

  Each ""One True Religion"" has its own weird dogmas and its own invisible gods, but where's the proof?  Why not test God's hypothetical existence?  Here's a very simple test.  Say we set up SIX sacrificial altars [provided by atheistic scientists], one for the genocidal Jews, one for the ""sword""-wielding Christians [Read the full quote of Matthew 10:34], one for the totally-conned Mormons, one for the totally-murderous Muslims, one for the caste-ridden Hindus, and one for The Faith Of The Invisible Pink Unicorns [as a scientific ""control"" group].  Say 12 adherents from each religion silently pray at least 15 yards away from their altar which is loaded up by atheistic scientific observers with an appropriate sacrifice to their God.  Each religious team prays for their God to ""magically"" ignite the altar fire and explosively consume the the sacrifice.  Naturally to avoid any technological mischief the entire test will be over-seen by atheistic scientists.  The FIRST team to ""magically ignite the sacrifice WINS.  Now I don't want any True Believers to copout by pleading that ""Thou shall not test the Lord thy God [See Deuteronomy 6:16].  This TEST isn't a test that I made up.  This is exactly how Elijah tested YHWH/Jehovah/Jesus/Allah in 1Kings 18:19-20.  If Elijah can safely disregard Deut. 6:16, I think that we're good to go.  The only change to Elijah's TEST I would make would be to forgo the execution of the losing teams of True Believers------Old TESTament Jews were such PRANKSTERS!  Enough with the vaudeville already!!

This show isn't funny in  the least.  For starters, the 2 main girls aren't remotely interesting to look at.  The brunette needs to drop about 25 pds, and both of em could use better faces.  I'm guessing that the cast director owed these two some Big favors!
To make matters worse, these two characters try hard to deliver witty lines (which is when you hear the canned laughter track), but their comments aren't funny, or interesting, or - Zzzzzzz.
Oh, sorry....I fell asleep just thinking about it. ;)
Another pathetic thing is, all of the other cast members!  For example, there's a black guy who works the cash register.  He plays your typical quick-witted character with a loveable, ghetto attitude.  Unfortunately, his scripted comments aren't -Zzzzzz.
Damn, I did it again.  Sorry.
Oh, and then there's this chef in the kitchen.  He's supposed to be character who often flirts with the girls but is actually the sensitive guy who tries to keep them out of trouble.  The problem, though, is -Zzzzzzzzzzzzz",1434067200,6,1130,4.803108808290156

I don't know if it's in the delivery or just the way it's written / set up all together.  I think Beth Behrs & Kat Dennings are fine actresses, but this show just doesn't work for me.  Lucky for them, it seems I'm in the minority here, as the show appears to be pretty well received.  Just not for me.

For context, I love a good comedy and/or dramedy (Friends, Seinfeld, TBBT, HIMYM, New Girl, The Mindy Project, Playing House, Mike & Molly, Arrested Development, etc.).  Something about 2 Broke Girls just misses the mark for me.",1420416000,,633,4.405172413793103
4535466,1,B0053O8AQE,"I regret purchasing the first season of this show for a number of reasons. The misogyny directed toward poor women and the constant invasion of their privacy is not something to joke about and, contrary to the show's portrayal, poor women do not enjoy being objectified or degraded. Sexual violence in and out of relationships, street and workplace harassment, economic exploitation, and limited access to basic human rights, such as food and shelter, deserve serious attention because of the impact they have on so many women's lives. Reducing these issues to cheap jokes not only prevents us from understanding the burdens these women carry. The same critiques can be made about the show's treatment of racism, especially towards black and asian men.

I choose to stop watching this show partway through the third episode, following yet another rape joke. While most of the negative reviews for this show concern its unimaginative and lazy writing, I cannot ignore the many ways in which the show reduces and distorts the realities of poor women's lives.",1420243200,10,1056,5.104046242774566

I don't know why that is??  The writing is amazing and the relationship between the characters is so heart-warming (between the verbal slams...lol), it's an instant winner in my opinion.

I've read some of the negative reviews of this show, and I think people don't get it. This is a SITCOM. There will be audience/canned laughter, stereotypes, not terribly deep character development and snappy but unrealistic dialogue/plot lines.

This is not going to be Arrested Development, Louie, or the Daily Show. Those are different types of television comedies. Complaining about this sitcom behaving like a sitcom is like complaining about Heavy Metal being loud, aggressive and lyrically violent.

This does what it's supposed to do, no more.

Great character development at a slow but steady pace with jokes and snarky comebacks that rise naturally out of the situation the girls find themselves in.  The three recurring male characters are, at first take, stereotypical cardboard cut-outs but it soon becomes apparent that the girls are sincerely fond of them; the two-dimensional quality is merely the writers reversing a decades old practice of male writers treating women the exact same way.

4535796,1,B0053O8AQE,"With all the positive reviews of this show, I may have to study whether TV can cause Stockholm Syndrome. That was a joke I thought off the top of my head, and it had more substance anything I saw in the show. 2 Broke Girls biggest problem is that it thinks its more clever than it actually is. The show thinks its a symbol of economic struggle and women's rights, but it does so little to let the characters express themselves as people instead of sexual objects. Any substance is thrown out because the characters are only there to recite sexual innuendo to each other. I will give Beth Behrs some credit. She is trying so hard in this role to make Caroline more than the writing wants her to be. It is to the point that she overacts to try to sell the joke. Kat Dennings seems so lost. She has no idea what to do with the character. It is like she is afraid to let Max have an expression because it will destroy the tough-as-nails character. The socioeconomic aspect of the show is almost non-existent. They never really seem to be struggling like real people in the same situation. I would give the show credit for that if it had the talent to at least do that right. Unfortunately, any sense of realism (which the station heavily marketed before airing) is not there. There's no point in talking about the obvious sex jokes, racial stereotypes, or the overly-padded script. My opinion will not change your mind. The only people who will look at this will be the people who already hate the show. That's what I did before I saw that very few people actually dislike this show. I just want to add another voice to the minority.",1372291200,13,1629,4.415282392026578

4535800,5,B0053O8AQE,"The first 8 episodes are my favorites! I believe they embody the concept of the show better than any of the subsequent episodes. The chemistry between Max & Oleg & Max & Earl is hilarious and I believe the writers need to refocus there.

The show is called 2 BROKE Girls so it was very believable that Max had 2 jobs especially since having a small cupcake business wouldn't have made her enough money to quit her 2nd job babysitting in Manhattan and that job could have even helped fund the cupcake business' materials. Peach was a great character to show the contrast between Caroline's outlook on being rich and Peach's outlook on being rich; she was also great to show the contrast between Max's common sense & down-to-earth personality & Peach's complete lack of common sense.

Even my husband loves the show! It may have ""girls"" in the title & have 2 girls as the main characters, but the type of humor & other characters create a hilarious show that both guys and girls will enjoy.

Many of the shows writers, consultants, producers used to work on the ""WIll and Grace"" show, so it's no secret were this show gets it's wit and humor from. The blu ray packaging offers a ""freebie"" in the form of digital copies of the entire season through the often loathed and hatred of ""Ultraviolet"" and it's sister or partner company ""Flikster"". I have never been a fan of either and never will be. I refuse to let these companies dictate when, where, if and how I can watch my content. That being said I decided to suppress my usual vomit inducing tendencies when either of the aforementioned names are uttered, and proceeded to activate the code on Flikster's web site to gain access to season one. My intent was to watch  the series using the free Flikster app available for use on apple's iPad and phone. if you do this you will be wasting your time people. The series is not available, and there is no eta as to when it will be available.

4535854,4,B0053O8AQE,"Kat Dennings, whom caught my attention in Marvel's Thor, is Max Black and  plays opposite/roommate/friend/business partner of Beth Behrs, Caroline Channing.  This comedy has potential to reach higher level of popularity if it restructured some of it's cast, crude humor and pointless subplots and just focus on the friendship of Max and Caroline, their pursuit to become something more than two waitresses in one of the worse diners to ever be on television.  The secondary/supporting cast bring nothing to the show, the relationship with Caroline's pet horse, Chestnut brings more heart and realism than the rest of the cast. The first season is setting up the show, but hopefully season two speeds up the girls goals of making enough money to fully launch their cupcake business. What I love about this show is their determination to become more, even Caroline, who has to overcome her father's criminal past; both girls have their troubled past and find a way to form this fun and hilarious friendship that seems possible for two young struggle against the world.  Max's dark and sexual humor is great, because I can relate to using humor to deal with stresses of life; Carline's willingness to make something out of herself, hopefully learn from her father's mistakes is truly nice to watch these girls grow.",1370217600,,1312,5.032258064516129

The writing is as lazy as it gets, extremely simple, and will always take the path of least resistance (hey, another Asian stereotype joke, sex innuendo, ect..). I watched most of the first season and tuned in to catch a little bit of the newer episodes..nothing has change.

The overwhelming positive reviews on here baffle me, maybe that's what possessed me to provide my opinion. This is what passes as good TV? I don't understand how CBS continues to dominate the ratings. I would think that the quote ""older generation viewers"" they have would be turned off by a show like this.

I think the thing that irks me the most is that actual good shows on that are on other networks struggle to get viewers and get cancelled or put on the chopping block every other week.

In the brief time I did watch it, I could tell, there are scenes/stories where it would try to show heart, but again, it's simply too lazy.",1349913600,28,1033,4.426315789473684

But it's not that easy, a lot of complications, like money issues, or love, and even funny situations get in the way of this girls.

4536313,5,B0053O8AQE,"One of the many wonderful surprises for me watching this ""2 Broke Girls"" series on DVD recently (and yes, I bought season 1 here at Amazon!! (LOL) are the many QUIET and GENUINELY MOVING moments many of the episodes manage to incorporate -- much the way that ""Taxi,"" ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" ""All In the Family,"" and ""Cheers"" adroitly do -- including that truly wonderful, moving scene where the usually always-optimistic/upbeat Caroline suddenly begins sobbing uncontrollably in front of Max, as she tearfully tells Max she's terrified that she'll say the ""wrong thing"" at the upcoming deposition Caroline has to give regarding her father's fraud and embezzlement activities (something that, conceivably, could cause Caroline's once-rich father to be transferred to a much tougher/rougher prison in ANOTHER state, thereby preventing a similarly-broke Caroline from being able to visit him in prison again anytime soon).

A lot has been written about how FUNNY this series is, but I think it has a lot of HEART, too -- one of the many things that had me fervently rooting for Max and Caroline from the very first episode, on.",1348099200,5,1129,5.06989247311828
4536314,5,B0053O8AQE,"Seriously, I love her SO MUCH! I have never seen an actor who could deliver the snark line after line after line, and keep it as amazingly fresh and well delivered as she does.  She has a great team of writers giving her AWESOME lines to deliver, and they are awesome.  Even just her delivery of surprise lines like ""NO WAY!"" is awesome.

My wife and I first saw her in Thor, and loved her in it (she was really the only part of that movie we liked), and we were pleasantly surprised to see her in 2 Broke girls alongside Beth Behrs -- even though Beth really just serves as the primary thing-to-be-mocked.

Make no mistake, 2 Broke Girls is raunchy. It is NOT for younger viewers. The pilot alone should send that message.  And I can see where the claims of racism, etc. come from.  But, if you are willing to acknowledge that all sides are getting shot at fairly, and there isn't real racism, sexism or anything else terrible on display (just uncomfortable at times), then you should enjoy the show.

2 Broke Girls certainly pushes boundries, but the show is incredibly funny, and well acted. You can totally side with either girl in any given moment, and it is easy to sympathize with Kat's character ""Max"" when she shows her tender, emotionally-wounded side sometimes, and it is easy to sympathize with Beth's character ""Caroline"" -- pretty much all the time.

Yes, the show is raunchy, and yes it can be uncomfortable at times, but it is still hilarious, and like I said, I love Kat Dennings.

She has a great team of writers giving her AWESOME lines to deliver, and they are awesome.  Even just her delivery of surprise lines like ""NO WAY!"" is awesome.

My wife and I first saw her in Thor, and loved her in it (she was really the only part of that movie we liked), and we were pleasantly surprised to see her in 2 Broke girls alongside Beth Behrs -- even though Beth really just serves as the primary thing-to-be-mocked.

Make no mistake, 2 Broke Girls is raunchy. It is NOT for younger viewers. The pilot alone should send that message.  And I can see where the claims of racism, etc. come from.  But, if you are willing to acknowledge that all sides are getting shot at fairly, and there isn't real racism, sexism or anything else terrible on display (just uncomfortable at times), then you should enjoy the show.

2 Broke Girls certainly pushes boundries, but the show is incredibly funny, and well acted. You can totally side with either girl in any given moment, and it is easy to sympathize with Kat's character ""Max"" when she shows her tender, emotionally-wounded side sometimes, and it is easy to sympathize with Beth's character ""Caroline"" -- pretty much all the time.

Yes, the show is raunchy, and yes it can be uncomfortable at times, but it is still hilarious, and like I said, I love Kat Dennings.

5 stars.",1347148800,19,1507,4.511029411764706
4536386,5,B0053O8AQE,This show is funny for the most part and well worth watching I personally have watched all the episodes multiple multiple times. They still are able to get me to laugh. This show is well worth the 24.00 to purchase :).,1346803200,,218,4.341463414634147
4536387,2,B0053O8AQE,A new show which seemed promising but fell flat. The show reminds me of the smash hit Alice but 2 Broke Girls is no Alice.....the show isn't funny and the punch lines are too raunchy for my taste. Again you can find this dvd cheaper if you look around. Let's hope Amazon lowers the price on this dvd. Do I recommend this dvd...no. Instead pick up the first season Alice.,1346371200,3,370,4.3
4536388,5,B0053O8AQE,"Darn good show, and funny too. That's a hard find these days. So glad to see they're releasing it on Blu-Ray, and not just DVD. Highly recommended!!",1346112000,2,148,4.518518518518518
4536389,5,B0053O8AQE,"At times the humor..or lack thereof..is a bit daunting, but all in all this is a delightful show. Love all the characters.

Not sure why they felt the need get rid of Kat Dennings love interest. Johnny was cute, funny and their chemistry was fabulous. Then to ""marry him off"" was unthinkable. Peach's character is hilarious...and so they get rid of her too?  What gives?  Bringing in the upstairs Polish Princess neighbor was OK for a few episodes, but now they seem to be giving her WAY too big a piece of the show. The writers need to re-focus on the girls.

The writing is a bit off at times, but this show is worth watching.

It's light, funny and is a great way to kill a half hour.",1344470400,12,687,4.294573643410852

4536391,1,B0053O8AQE,"Look, I was really hoping this show would be good. I've been a fan of Kat Dennings for a while now, but as of yet she hasn't really had any projects worthy of her talents, and I was really hoping that this would finally be the one.

Boy, was this a disappointment.

2 Broke Girls is yet another mindless sitcom from CBS, the 'proud' presenters of other trash such as Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. This, unfortunately, was made in the same mindset as those: take a bunch of talented young actors, give them the most generic comedy personalities available (Girl #1 is sassy, streetsmart, and won't take any crap; Girl #2 is a formerly-rich airheaded blonde who doesn't understand working life), write plots that require absolutely none of your attention (this time they're gonna be maids!), fill the scripts with the most obvious punchlines imaginable, then hire a crowd of people to laugh as if it's the funniest thing they ever did see. With a couple seconds of channel flipping, you could find the exact same jokes and scenarios, only done much better, and usually done over ten years ago.

The cast really does try to make the proceedings worthwile, but the fact of the matter is, this is comedy white noise. It's simple, inoffensive (topically, not intellectually), and the kind of show you can watch while working. This is a show where if you miss ten minutes from the middle, it will take less than 20 seconds to get caught up. And really, I understand the need for shows like this. Sometimes after a long day of work, you just want to turn your brain off and laugh. But there are better shows for that, and just because you don't want to use your brain doesn't meen you need to have it insulted.

Please, watch something other than this. There are so many brilliant, yet overlooked comedies on tv right now (Louie, Key & Peele, Comedy Bang Bang, etc) that there's really no excuse for wasting your time on this drivel. Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Even the most recent episodes of How I Met Your Mother are better than this.",1342310400,26,2061,4.547169811320755
4536392,3,B0053O8AQE,"I started watching TWO BROKE GIRLS mostly because of the talented and beautiful Kat Dennings (who I fell in love with in CHARLIE BARTLETT and continued that love in THOR) and was really enjoying it for the first five episodes or so. I thought that the performances of the two leads (Dennings and Beth Behrs) were quite good, and their comic timing was pretty spot-on. However, the psuedo-shock ""offensive"" comedy of co-creator Whitney Cummings as well as the female-empowerment/hyper-sexual comic stylings of other co-creator Michael Patrick King (of SEX AND THE CITY fame) do become grating, because the repetition of the shock-comedy loses its edge after six or seven episodes of single and double-entendres, the stereotyping of the diner's meek Korean owner Han (Matthew Moy) and its Eastern Bloc refugee sex fiend Oleg (Jonathan Kite) and making fun of just about everyone.

Plot-wise, it's a female mismatched buddy comedy: You have Max, the hard-as-nails, smart-mouthed, street-wisened babe (Dennings) and you have Caroline, the spoiled-but-newly-poor statue-esque blonde beauty naive little rich girl (Behrs). Paired together in a surprisingly-spacious yet somehow-affordable-on-a-waitress-and-babysitter salary as well as the 24-hour greasy spoon diner they both work in, Max teaches Caroline the realities of the world after being ungraciously thrust from her life of privledge after her Madoff-like father is imprisoned for putting together a Ponzi scheme, and then Caroline teaches Max about the business of selling Max's ""designer"" homemade cupcakes. It's not quite a 21st-Century female version of THE ODD COUPLE, but it's close.

I'm glad that there is a comedy on network TV that has a little edge to it (since that's primarily reserved for pay cable stations like FX, which has shows like WILFRED and LOUIE or HBO, which has GIRLS, VEEP and THE RICKY GERVAIS SHOW), but the comedic appeal of TWO BROKE GIRLS isn't quite enough to hold interest since the sitcom aspects are a little tired and the supporting cast just doesn't have much to offer.

However, I have nothing but praise for Dennings and Behrs. They work their comedy very well and have some nice character-developing moments as well. The show will live or die based on their performances, and as I stated before, this is a likeable enough show, but it's not a weekly watch for me anymore.",1341100800,8,2365,5.218421052631579

4536394,5,B0053O8AQE,"I have been waiting to get the entire season of the show all at once. It is a testament to the producing and writing genius of Whitney Cummings and the stellar comedic timing of Kat Dennings.

From episode 1 they had me. I absolutely love Kat Dennings and scene-stealer Jonathan Kite as Oleg. The whole cast is strong, and it's refreshing to find a sitcom so funny and well-written in these days of reality tv.
My only question is when is the release date for these discs? Please include that bit of info on the merchandise page, please, Amazon.",1338768000,,452,4.592592592592593

8455384,5,B0053O8AQE,"This is one of the best comedies on TV. The writing is hilarious, but the real gem is the actresses and the way they deliver it. It's created by a woman and starring two women so that is why I first decided to support it, but I quickly fell in love. I mean come on Stiffler's mom is in this show ( Jennifer Coolidge) all grown up and still hot as the Polish neighbor who wears clothes too tight and falls in love with Olaf the sex crazed hairy chef. Max is used to living poor with a life of survival. Her delivery of the lines doesn't need a laugh track, because she will have you rolling on your own. Caroline Channing is a rich white girl who lived a life of privilege until her father's ponzy scheme came crashing down stripping her of everything except her clothes and her pearls. She is forced to work as a waitress and live with Max in Brooklyn or be homeless. The show is about their struggles of being poor, working at the diner, and trying to make it with a dream of owning a cupcake business. You can't help but love the story and the characters. 10/10 recommend.",1516060800,,1074,4.218446601941747
