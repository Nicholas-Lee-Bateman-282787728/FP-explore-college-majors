8321406,1,B001MLBTBA,"I am rating this a ""one"" star because I ordered it and found out that it does not play on my computer.  It says ""NON-US Format"" which I thought, as others, this was just a different format but it doesn't play at all.  I am trying to return them at my own expense but no answer from seller yet. Why do they sell and ship them to U.S. without clarifying this?  Why do they even sell them in the U.S.?",1463011200,,398,3.95
8321407,4,B001MLBTBA,"Thought provoking, aggravating, brilliantly written series.  Having seen the episodes numerous times, I was extremely pleased to be able to have my own set to watch at will.  Beware, however, once you start you will not be able to stop until you have viewed it all; then you will wish there were more episodes.",1364515200,,310,4.722222222222222
8321408,2,B001MLBTBA,"I can't play this on my computer. I think it is not a U.S, item. So I have not been able to see any of it yet. Playing it on my computer is not satisfactory.",1361836800,,157,3.5142857142857142
8321409,5,B001MLBTBA,"In my quest to watch some of the best television that never got shown in India (some for commercial reasons, some simply because the Indian audience was not ready for it), I had come across this particular program. After purchasing the box set, I had tried to see as many of them as possible, and in the process had realised quite well that certain things must be taken in small dosage. Thereafter, the viewing was spread over many evenings, and I have finally managed to conclude the viewing only today. It was an experience that I would remember for a long time.

This series, as has been already mentioned by numerous reviewers, is a classic, that goes much beyond the generic cops-nailing-criminals routine. It shows the rise of Jane Tennison through all her personal achievements in terms of solving crime, taking on the chauvinistic male-dominated (and regulated) structure of Police hierarchy, and attempts to overcome her personal problems: loneliness, alcoholism, proximity towards colleagues or others that might severly undermine her position from another point of view only because she had cared for them, and of course the fact that she is an woman.

For me, an Indian who is compelled to watch some of the most mindless crap that can be served through television because those are the only programs that succeed in getting advertisements, this series was truly illuminating. It showed how harsh the telelights can be in their almost brutal depiction of light & darkness, courage & fear, success & defeat, and how everything looks different from the other side. As X-Files proclaimed, the truth is indeed out there, but are we ready to see it in such harsh lights?",1312070400,,1677,4.943262411347518
8321410,5,B001MLBTBA,"Great collection. Wonderful to be able to purchase it at a great price! Quality of DVDs is good. As a fan of CSI, it finally dawned on me that tv crime  series like CSI owe EVERYTHING to Prime Suspect. To top it off, Jane T. really was the first female lead in a male dominated genre. Thank you.",1275868800,2,295,4.086206896551724
8321411,1,B001MLBTBA,"Unfortunately, I was unable to view the purchase due to the Non-US Format.  I thought the film would simply have some european style format that would just be a little different from US made films.  I can't imagine why this would even be available to this region, if it requires a special player. The little education cost me $88.00.",1258070400,2,333,4.627118644067797
8321412,5,B001MLBTBA,Why isn't the PRIME SUSPECT box set available in US format?  To buy each disc separately is a Supreme rip-off. In the meantime I'm waiting impatiently watching BLUE MURDERS (US format)!,1252195200,3,185,4.967741935483871
