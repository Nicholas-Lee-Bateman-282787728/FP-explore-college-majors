8629212,4,B002IGLCQA,The yoga video is very well done the girls looked like they know what they were doing and things were explained well.  Plus you had something nice to look at. The stretching had no words but things are show well and done slow. Sometimes they are showing close ups when the girls switch moves which leaves you at a loss. The tai chi is worthless. The girls have no clue how to do the yang style short form. The girls show the same move over and over and it changes a lot each time. Plus at the end they do not even show you the yang form. They state to make you own out of the moves they have shown you,1365724800,,601,3.9669421487603307
