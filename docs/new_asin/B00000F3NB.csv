1209444,5,B00000F3NB,"I recently became obsessed with this movie. I'd seen it in pre-school and somehow remembered the songs, stories, and humorous skits up through college. And I'm not alone! Others like me are frantically searching for this piece of their childhood, perhaps the only video to REALLY say to kids, ""Just be yourself."" A football player tells boys it's okay to cry, a fairy-tale tells girls they don't have to get married, and Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas approach subjects like gender roles and childcare in four skits that can have even grown-ups laughing out loud. Though the song featuring a young Michael Jackson singing ""We don't have to change at all"" is extremely ironic and more than a little sad, the video is a fun experience overall. The book and soundtrack are also both wonderful tools to have in raising open-minded children, but I must admit that as cheesy as it sounds, it's the movie that really helped shape my life.",998784000,42,928,4.770186335403727

We are SO EXCITED this is out on VHS to pass on to our children! It teaches children, and reminds us adults, that it's O.K. to be yourself and that it's fun to be a child. The music is great and if you saw this as a kid, you'll probably still remember all the words! Well worth the purchase to add to your child's video collection.",998611200,4,454,3.9456521739130435

1209489,5,B00000F3NB,"I didn't see this special until I was an adult, and I saw it on TV land during a that girl marathon. Years later I saw it on DVD, and loved it so much, I took the library's back and bought my own copy. The baby sketches with Mel brooks are hilarious. How can you not laugh over a baby who aspires to be a cocktail waitress? The animated cartoons make me laugh, especially the kid who makes the hand gestures about the girl who talks to much in ladies first. I think the show really holds up and has a beautiful message that you can be whatever you want to, no matter if you're a boy or girl. Its OK to cry. Parents can have jobs and still be parents. A boy can have a doll, and there's nothing wrong with that. You can get married, but its OK if you don't. Oh, and Mel brooks is hilarious as a baby puppet.

The ""music"" is enjoyable, catchy tune's etc. and the messages are good for anyone to ""hear"" again.  Sometimes in this crazy mixed up world we live in these days, it's a nice little escape and reminder we are Still ""FREE"" to be ourselves.  Which to me means, ""To Thine Ownself Be True!""

1209622,5,B00000F3NB,"Classic from my childhood. I think kids can learn to just ""be"" with this movie. A bit dated , but the idea of not feeling like you belong is as old as time and this movie can show kids just how normal that is:)",1392076800,,210,3.7954545454545454
1209623,5,B00000F3NB,"I remember this film from when I was a kid. When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled. My kids, ages 4 and 18 months, LOVE it. Engaging, nonviolent, and a timeless anti-bullying message that seems to have been forgotten in the last 40 years.",1388707200,,240,4.239130434782608
1209624,3,B00000F3NB,"I was in grade school when this came out, and our music teacher had us watch the special in class. I liked it so much that I got the 8 track and played it incessantly for years.

Now my daughter is old enough for it.

And it is pretty good. But in a lot of ways ""Free to Be . . . You and Me"" doesn't stand the test of time.

In some ways it's a victim of society's changes. ""William's Doll"" was revolutionary at the time this came out, but my 8 year old doesn't see why a boy having a doll is such a big deal, and anyway kids are not allowed (thank heavens) to chase each other around yelling ""sissy!"" these days.

In some ways it isn't progressive enough, Mommies and Daddies are people? Well, that's kinda binary. There are so many people in families that aren't hinted at in this special supposedly about how everyone is great. Also, the racial inclusion is kinda forced. If the piece isn't specifically about inclusion, this isn't especially inclusive. The ""boy"" and ""girl"" puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas are pretty darned white.

Atalanta remains great, the art, the story, the voice acting. ""When We Grow Up"" is sweet, even though it enforces, rather than blasting, gender norms.

In general, the pretty good messages are obscured by dated visuals and you are better off getting the CD, which also allows you to hear some of the great parts not animated for this special.",1388361600,,1392,4.43921568627451

1209628,5,B00000F3NB,"I was so happy to get a copy of this again ... I couldn't find mine from ""back in the day"".

1209629,5,B00000F3NB,"Loved this special when I was a kid and when I watched it, all of the memories came flooding back.  Still, there are a few things in the video that are a little ""politically incorrect"", but for the most part the idea that anyone can do anything is a very good message.  Amazing to see Michael Jackson and Roberta Flack sing a song about not changing the way they are.  Too bad Michael never took his own advice back then.",1380758400,,421,4.2375

1209656,5,B00000F3NB,"Faaaaaaaaar Out!  Took a trip down memory lane with this one. Got to share it with my 14 year old daughter. I was in grade 8 when I first saw it and thought at the time that it was the hippest most progressive film available for kids coming of age. When I ordered it recently, I wondered if it would be too dated to share with my daughter, but she laughed like crazy at most everything. She particularly loved Marlo's voice, and picked it out immediately, and also was thrilled to recognize Mel Brooks voice. ""That's the history of the world stand up philosopher guy"" she jumped up and yelled. (still my favorite movie of all time). It makes my heart leap for joy when I hear her say to her hip teen friends at school ""Oh Faaaaaaaar out!""  Both of us love Marlo, and particularly the sweet young thing and baby nursery skits. Thanks for making this exceptional film. The lessons it teaches about acceptance, growing up, fears, manners etc are still what we want to tell our kids about.

I grew up with this TV show as a kid in the early 70s, not unlike many others here, and have never forgotten the timeless messages that permeate its presentation.  Free to Be You and Me is for kids of all ages in any generation.  One of my favorites is when Marlo Thomas and Mel Brooks are the voices of the babies, but my absolute favorite, which can't be of much surprise, is the New Seekers singing the title track.  Between this and most anything Sid and Marty Krofft have ever put out, I feel fairly confident that out-of-date to some people means nothing to small children who just love to be entertained and learn valuable lessons.  I love to sit and watch this sort of thing with them, we can have a great time doing it, and we can hope the generation behind us will embrace it and spread the love.

1209701,5,B00000F3NB,"Don't believe the other reviews saying that there is a positive message in this video.  There is NOT a positive message in this video.  This video is intended to contribute to the destruction of our society by emasculating boys and encouraging girls to wait until later in life to start a family or to possibly not start a family at all.  This video tries to teach girls that it is admirable to choose `exploring the world' before choosing to have a family.

I knew that I was in for some serious social engineering when, during the opening song, we see Marlo Thomas pretending to operate a jack-hammer while singing something about how girls can do anything they want, including jobs that most females are not physically capable of doing.  My point here is not chauvinistic.  My point here is that this video is trying to encourage girls to want things that they would not naturally want.

I watched this video mainly to see Marlo Thomas.  But we don't see much of her.  Most of the video is filled with animated segments and disturbing puppetry.

One of the animated segments is about a boy (William) who wants a doll.  When his father finds out that William wants a doll, he's not too thrilled about the idea.  So he buys William a baseball glove and some other sports equipment.  William grows to love sports and he even excels at sports.  But he still wants a doll.  Finally, his grandmother buys William a doll as a gift.  The moral of the story is that there is nothing wrong with a boy who wants to play with dolls.  In fact, in this video, the assertion is made that it is actually a positive thing for William to play with dolls.  It is explained at the end of the segment that playing with a doll will help William learn how to take care of a baby when he becomes a father.  I'm not joking.  This video seriously states that playing with dolls will help a boy learn how to take care of a baby.  If you don't believe me, watch the video yourself.

There is another segment in this video called, ""It's alright to cry.""  This segment encourages boys to cry.  It states that boys who don't cry are sissies.  Great, just what this country needs, a bunch of boys who are crybabies and who love to play with dolls.

There are many other disturbing messages in this video.  But this review is already getting pretty long.  So I'll end it now by saying that I am giving this video a five star rating because the attempt at social engineering is so obvious and over-the-top that it is fascinating to behold.  I had to watch it twice to believe what I was seeing.  If you enjoy studying the social engineering that has been going on throughout the years, I highly recommend watching `Free To Be You And Me'.  But don't show it to your kids.",1286150400,,2740,4.42

I memorized the stories, learned the songs, and felt so empowered by the gentle advice to be yourself, follow your dreams, and not let anyone tell you what you should think or how you should act.

That message applies today, as much as it did 35 years ago, and those who have yet to see this DVD or read the book or hear the CD are in for a treat.

Yes, the visuals are VERY 70s, but the retro look is part of the charm.

My kids watched the DVD and were transfixed.  Twice a day for a week, they couldn't get enough of it.  My son had a friend over for a playdate and as they went to watch this DVD, I heard my son say, ""You've GOT to watch this, it is SO COOL!""

1209734,2,B00000F3NB,"I am reviewing this DVD as it pertains to today's child, not for sentimentality, of which I am personally quite often guilty.  As at least one reviewer wrote, this film really helped her as a child appreciate herself and better communicate her feelings with others.  I can definitely see its value (then), as there weren't lots of other kids' films out there encouraging self-love and self-pride.  So I get why it came into being in 1974.  Much of it is gender-related, as this was at the height of the ""second wave"" of the Women's Lib Movement.  The Billie Jean King/Bobby Riggs match was in 1973, the year before.  So it is interesting to watch it as a historic ""sign of the times"" piece.  I am nostalgic for this childhood stuff like many others, so I can see why adults in their 30s and 40s love watching this again.  But, I think there are other more current shows and DVDs that better convey its messages to an audience of children today.  (Although, gosh, you can't top Rosey Grier singing ""It's Alright to Cry!"" and how awesome is the ""Sisters and Brothers"" number with the teenagers singing and dancing in the park?)

My nearly 5-year-old daughter was full of questions while watching this DVD.  She asked, ""What's a sissy?"" and ""Why are the boys and girls teasing the boy because he wants a doll?""  She knows boys at her school that carry around types of ""dolls,"" and it hadn't occurred to her that there was anything weird or unusual about it until watching this segment.  Oh, and while Michael Jackson and Roberta Flack did a great ""When We Grow Up"" duet, one of its messages to kids is still the stereotype that girls should WANT to grow up and be pretty and tall is the ideal for boys and men.  I also couldn't help but notice that throughout the film, there are no kids with disabilities.  And, the Harry Belafonte/Marlo Thomas ""Parents are People"" number, while well-intentioned at the time of course, might be confusing for kids that don't have the ""standard"" one mommy and one daddy in their family or for kids with transgender parents (or for kids dealing with their own issues of gender identity).  Okay, perhaps I am looking too much into it, but the ""free to be me"" message isn't as there as I had thought it would be for my daughters.  It's more like, ""Here's how people think people should act/think/be/live.""

And 5 star reviewers, don't be hating. : )  I watched it and loved it as a kid and enjoyed watching it again as a 40-year-old.  Sigh.  There are just too many things that stand out as not being as timeless and great for kids now as I expected.",1248393600,19,2578,4.524838012958964
1209735,5,B00000F3NB,"First, you might fault the video quality of the DVD, but the underlying message of the program is timeless.  I remember the program fondly from my childhood and I have been saddened by its absence from schools I've taught at in the last twenty years.  I'm surprised to find so many people are not familiar with this production.  Marlo Thomas did a wonderful job assembling such great talent for the book, album and television show.  Now the book is available in an anniversary edition, there's a CD and, of course, this DVD.  All should be a part of your child's library.  I shared the DVD with my students during their final week of school.  Many lamented that they couldn't watch the entire program during their visit to the library.  I played it repeatedly during the final three days of school.  The DVD features songs and segments you won't find in the book and CD.  Yes, the animation and dress of the performers are dated...but, so what?  This program can and should be enjoyed with you by your child's side so that you can explain these differences to him.  My four-year-old niece loves the show and wants to watch it again and again.  She adores the songs and the ""babies"" especially.  This DVD is worth every penny.  Its optimistic message is perhaps even more important now than when it first appeared.",1247616000,2,1313,4.647826086956521

1209737,5,B00000F3NB,"Free to be you and me is an excellent DVD presentation with stories, music and wonderful animation.  It is for children three and up and even an adult can enjoy it.",1241740800,,164,4.290322580645161
1209738,5,B00000F3NB,"Free To Be You And Me stars Marlo Thomas, Harry Belafonte, Rosey Grier, Michael Jackson, Kris Kristopherson and others who lend their voices to the animated shorts that make up this brief but very sweet message directed at children. Simply put, Free To Be You And Me tells children that they should love their fellow human beings as brothers and sisters; and children learn that they can and should try to achieve their dreams in childhood and especially in adulthood as well.

While some scenarios feature the actors going through routines to show that anything is possible (and remember, Marlo Thomas posing as a construction worker was practically radical back in 1974), other scenarios are animated. The animation isn't always the greatest, but it's more than adequate and it helps to impart a meaningful message anyway. For example, in one animated scenario we meet a King's daughter named Atalanta. She doesn't feel so sure that she wants to get married despite the fact that her father the King (the symbol of authority and what society expects for a young woman) wants her to get married right away. When there is a contest to see who can win the right to marry Atalanta, she meets her match in a young man named John from the village. John and Atalanta come in tied for first place; and John is wise enough to know that Atalanta has to want to marry him and that she cannot be forced to marry simply because that's what other people in society expect for a young woman to do.

Another wonderful animated scenario concerns a young boy named Dudley Pippin. Dudley is accused by his teacher of spilling paint all over the floor at school. Although Dudley denies it, his teacher doesn't believe him and makes him clean up the mess long after all the other children have gone home. Dudley then goes home--but on his way home he meets the principal who tells Dudley that it's OK to cry about being so misunderstood by his teacher. This animated segment leads straight into the very famous (well, it was very famous at the time) segment in which the ultra-macho football star Rosey Grier sings ""It's All Right To Cry"" while playing the guitar. ""It's All Right To Cry"" is very masterfully done and Rosey doesn't falter one bit.

In general, the other segments teach children that it's OK to be in touch with their feelings about friends, siblings and their parents. There's even a segment on the importance of letting a young boy have a doll--so that he can see what it's like to be a father when he grows up to have his own children.

Overall, Free To Be You And Me doesn't lack much. The quality of the print could have been cleaned up somewhat; but it's all so good that this is really minor. I highly recommend this film for children to watch; it might also stimulate some meaningful conversation between parents and their children, too.",1239321600,,2842,4.655378486055777
1209739,5,B00000F3NB,"It was a wonderful treat to revisit Free to be You and Me! And a gentle reminder at how much we take for granted now in the realm of parenting and working. This was one of the first mass market efforts to show kids that mommies and daddies could move away from traditional jobs, that daddies were nurturers, that boys had feminine sides and girls masculine and that differences were something to be celebrated not dismissed. Rosie Greer's singing It's Alright To Cry was brilliant and the baby sequence is delightful. Even though Free to Be You and Me is over 30 years old, it's message is current and worth getting out.

I too rented this on a whim and I'm so glad I did.  There is no better message to send to your kid than tolerance.

Proaganda?  Yeah...LOVE was a new voice of the time.  This is just a 45 minute movie showing kids that it is OK to be yourself.

I have to address Atalanta...finally a princess I can get behind!!  My daughter is in full princess mode right now.  She saw Cinderella and Barbie movies at our neighbors.  Plus they have a closet full of princess dress-up  gowns (even a wedding dress for a 2-4 yr old which I find a bit disturbing)  But I let her play because she loves it.

She dresses up, twirls around and talks about being beautiful.

Disney has created this artificial world of beauty and helplessness.  They won't be happy until Prince Charming sweeps in and carries them away.

What does Atalanta want?  To read, travel the world and LEARN.  She and 'John from the town' have mutual respect and are friends.

The 'Ladies first ' girl in the pink dress was rude.  Yes there is a custom of ladies first but she walked to the front of the line when other girls were waiting as well.

Seems some folks missed the point on this one.

Anything that is commercial free, not telling me what toothpaste to buy or what talking/blinking hammer to buy for my kid is all right for me.

But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.

Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.

Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.

Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ""ladies first.""  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.

Our ""hosts"", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.

1209823,4,B00000F3NB,My 4 year old daughter likes her DVD.  Dad bought it for her because he remembered it from his childhood.  He was disapointed that some of the skits he remembered were not included in the DVD but on the whole it rated well with him.  It gets watched pretty often in our house.,1120780800,10,276,4.169811320754717
1209824,5,B00000F3NB,"When my daughter was born, a relative and I wound up reminiscing about this album and how much we both loved it growing up.  Next thing I knew, a copy of the DVD arrived as a gift for my daughter and me.  The first time I sat down and watched, it brought back all my memories of being a little girl in the 70's.  I could even still sing along with the title song!  Right now, my daughter is too young to do much except listen as I sing or play music for her, but I hope she grows up enjoying these songs as much as I did.  Yes, the visuals are dated, but I believe the messages of these songs are as pertinent now as they were thirty years ago.  Best of all, the songs get their messages across without being ""preachy.""  I think this is a fabulous alternative to much of what's out there for kids today, and dated as some elements may be, ""Free to Be You and Me"" is still a long, long way from going out of style.",1116028800,78,913,3.9562841530054644
1209825,5,B00000F3NB,"This show was a favorite as a child, I loved to watch when it aired at home and  in school.  We also listened to the recording, we probably wore the groves off the record (remember records!).  I now have two toddlers and they enjoy watching and listening to it as much as I did.

Though it may look dated, it is timeless.  The universal messages, the wonderful writing, the cast and the music all make for an unequalled experience.  I know my grandchildren will watch and enjoy as much.",1109203200,8,486,4.404494382022472
1209826,4,B00000F3NB,"I loved Free To Be You and Me as a child and I love it now as an adult looking back.  As a young girl in the 70s, Free To Be taught me that girls could be anything they want and broke stereotypes for ALL children.  It taught us all that are feelings were important and singing was a cure for just about anything.  I love this DVD, but I am sad that they couldn't find room for Carol Channing and some of the others on the original record (found on the cd).  This DVD is a must-have!",1102032000,8,482,3.8877551020408165
1209827,5,B00000F3NB,"I have owned the CD and book since January 2004 and after alot of thought, I brought the DVD. I loved it alot. Some of the songs and scenes are not on the CD or book, which is great. A thing I would like to say. I had no problems playing the DVD on my Australian PS2 games and DVD player connected to a common medium sized TV one can get here.",1097798400,2,343,3.7777777777777777
1209828,3,B00000F3NB,"I purchased this DVD for my almost-three-year-old through a sentimental haze; I suppose I hadn't seen this on television since 1977 or so.  Back in the day, this show was broadcast annually, so I couldn't remember it too well - the puppets in the hospital nursery was about it.

But I certainly still had the songs in my head (my record was played daily) as well as the ideas, and these I wanted to share with my son. So, I bought the book and the CD and the DVD, all to make certain my son knows he is free to be, darn-tootin'.

The DVD, however, has turned out to be somewhat of a letdown.  As another reviewer wrote, it is dated. I can't see this show, in 2004, as the most effective vehicle to transport the message to little Sam. As for Mommy, I prefer to sing along with the CD, allowing my son to listen to what he's hearing and not get lost in (or perhaps bored by) what he's seeing on screen.

Somewhere on Amazon I read that the show was developed in response to the success of the record. This reassures me that the content is well-carried without the visuals.

Feel free to profit from my over-enthusiasm - I watched the DVD once after it arrived and probably won't again. And in Sam's book, the Free to Be DVD probably earns 4 stars, but ranks rather at the bottom of his must-see-for-the-43rd-time list.",1094428800,37,1317,4.333333333333333
1209829,4,B00000F3NB,"Very few kids who grew up in the seventies didn't have the pleasure of viewing this tape in school, the library, or on television.  We loved and learned the lyrics, the characters, and the lessons.  It was so cutting edge for its time ~ boys playing with dolls, girls growing up to be firefighters, etc.  Nowadays, our kids are weaned on computers, GameBoy, motor scooters and cell phones.  Though we pray for acceptance, it's not always easy to teach our kids today.  Watching this video with a child today probably won't have the same positive effect it did 3 decades ago, but they might still enjoy the stories.  The stars are filled with talent, i.e. Mel Brooks, Marlo Thomas, Alan Alda, and sickeningly enough, a young and innocent Michael Jackson before his transformation.  I still remember the words to each song, especially Rosie Grier's gentle, ""It's Alright to Cry"" and of course the title song, ""Free to Be You & Me.""  I think this still belongs in a classroom, just not sure it will make as great an impact today as when it was released.",1093737600,32,1050,4.6378378378378375
1209850,5,B00000F3NB,"I know that sounds political, but in a large part, it is true.  I had the record album when I was about five years old, and loved it.  Now I find that my own children can enjoy it, too! I have two girls, now, and I never want them to think that being a girl is a hindrance to whatever they want to be.  My oldest daughter (3 3/4 yrs old) says she wants to be a firefighter, and I always say, 'That's fine.'  Do the same for your kids!",1090281600,3,434,3.7888888888888888

(my kids love them!) and there's a part about not saying ""ladies first"" all the time, a part about women can do any job they like, and a part about a boy who wants a doll. It's great stuff.",1089936000,2,348,3.915492957746479

1209853,5,B00000F3NB,"I enjoyed this movie when I was a child, and now I have the pleasure of sharing this movie with my own children. I definitely recommend this movie for children of all ages. From live action to animation, Free to Be You and Me explores children's perspectives about things like brothers and sisters to little boys playing with dolls. Free To Be you and Me features talents by Alan Alda, Michael Jackson, Roberta Flack, Marlo Thomas ,Rosey Greir,Kris Kristopherson, and Mel Brooks.",1026345600,,479,4.853658536585366

If you wondered what Michael Jackson would have looked like if he didn't get that disease that turned his skin white or his nose ,eyes, lips,hair and chin job , watch this DVD for a classic moment of mike and Roberta Flack singing together. The songs are great and the little skits about growing up really kept my interest. By the way , the kids liked it,too.",1016150400,,389,4.342465753424658
1209855,5,B00000F3NB,"When the cd was released I was ecstatic. Just like so many others, this stuff stuck with me all of my life. It is so heart-felt, so honest, so idealistic in a way that is actually humanly possible! It's the kind of idealism that nourishes a child well. So much has changed in the world, but I was glad to be reminded of that soft center that had been cultivated within me in my childhood and which I associated to completely with this music. Everytime I hear it, honest to God and I feel slightly embarassed about this, I kind of always want to cry. Great funk influences, great folk influences, terrific Diana Ross track, a few really funny pieces, and SO RETRO!!!! Honestly, there is alot to make this valuable to so many different people. So many generations. I keep wondering when I'm going to hear some of it sampled in some spaced out electronica. Lovers of Free to Be and liberal ideals unite!",1006300800,4,900,4.460606060606061
1209856,5,B00000F3NB,"I want to thank the company that is re releasing this to DVD... I remember watching this when Projectors were still the rage in 1983..
To the person that says that crying is for sissies, you must be one cold hearted person. This film shows that it is OK to feel and that we all must get along together... I see nothing wrong with this film.
This is a film that displays thought about growing up and about different types of feelings. It even has a small segment about a boy wanting a doll!
Brilliant movie... It should help the yound ones of today with the peaks and valleys of growing up... I am going to order mine.. I am going to laugh, cry, and remember....",1000684800,9,661,4.253968253968254
1209857,5,B00000F3NB,"I have been searching for the VHS version of this production for 3 years now. Needless to say, I am beyond excited that it is being re-released on DVD. I was very influenced by this program when I first saw it in the third grade back in 1987. I was just learning how to be a best friend and how to deal with children teasing me for my very long and extremely coarse 'nappy' hair, my 'white' grandmother (she's biracial), and my 'funny' proper accent.
Watching this movie in Mrs. Hammond's 3rd grade class was eye-opening. It taught me that it was okay to cry about things and to talk about how I feel to family, friends, and bullies. I am definitely going to buy this DVD for my 15 month old son and his 1 month old twin sisters so they can enjoy it.
Oh, and the scenes with the baby puppets (a boy and a girl who teach kids about the differences and similarities between girls and boys) are must see--believe me. The scenes are extremely funny--I laugh just thinking about them--and are great for little kids and for dispelling some common social conceptions and misconceptions about gender & gender equality.
This program will re-enforce the lessons my husband and I are trying to teach our kids--epecially since we are a multi-racial family who speaks 3 languages at home and travels between our two homes. DO BUY THIS DVD when it becomes available.",999475200,45,1352,4.522448979591837

I have the cd and now I will be buying the dvd .It is a wonderful movie that deals with so many problems that occur in every day life for children. It is an upbeat and fun way to learn how to feel good about yourself as a child. I have been searching for the show since I had my first child. I am so happy they are re-releasing it.
