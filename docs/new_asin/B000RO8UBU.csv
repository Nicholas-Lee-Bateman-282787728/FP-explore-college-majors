2871009,5,B000RO8UBU,very much like hitchcock's style.  the feeling it evokes is very uneasy and chilling. great after-dark flick.,1186617600,2,109,5.411764705882353
2871010,5,B000RO8UBU,"This is one of the better independent films I've seen in a while.  Although the first five minutes start out a bit slow, once it picks up, you don't want to leave your seat (not unlike ""Shallow Grave"").
  The main character, Graham, is someone whose life is slowly falling apart.  His marriage is lacking  any kind of passion and he hates his job.  After he and his wife move into an old house, Graham meets ""The Dead Wife"".  He embarks on an affair with this woman who may be a ghost or may just be the symptom of his madness.
  The movie powerfully explores Graham's break from reality as he grows closer and closer to the dead wife...a journey that takes many chilling turns.
  This is a thought provoking, scary movie that stayed with me long after I finished watching it.  Highly recommended.",1186531200,4,797,4.496503496503497
2871011,5,B000RO8UBU,I was able to see this movie in the theater and I was very impressed with how original the plot was.  I enjoyed the story very much and felt it had a very unique resolution.  I would recommend this film as it is very different from any horror/thriller than you've seen before.,1184112000,5,276,4.288461538461538
8201711,1,B000RO8UBU,"I picked this movie up at the dollar tree, and honestly regretted it as soon as I watched it. It sounded good, but the movie itself was pretty boring. I think the story in other hands might have made a good movie, but it would have needed a whole new script, new actors, and a new director. I don't mean any offence to anyone who enjoyed the movie, but my husband and I both thought it wasn't very good.",1316304000,,403,4.113924050632911
8201712,1,B000RO8UBU,"To compare this film to Hitchcock is like comparing Jennifer Aniston's acting skills to Meryl Streep's, although Jennifer's acting is much better than the actors in this film. There went an hour and 22 minutes of my life I can never get back...",1308441600,3,244,4.6976744186046515
8201713,1,B000RO8UBU,"To say this low-budget film is similar to Hitchcock's work is an insult to the master director. Watch it and form your own opinion, but prepare to be disappointed.",1308441600,3,163,4.655172413793103
8201714,5,B000RO8UBU,How haunting!--what will he find at the top of the stairs?  The photo in the musicbox leads us on. Did the husband have a past life? How beautiful and enigmatic is the dead wife....This is well-acted and suspenseful.,1255996800,,216,4.684210526315789
8201715,1,B000RO8UBU,"I love independent films. I love films that are made with passion.

This is made with ego. From someone who probably should have let the script age a bit first. And gone through a few rewrites. And been edited by someone who hadn't taken a sleeping potion.

Really, unless you are looking for a soporific experience, give it a pass.",1192060800,,332,4.516666666666667
8201716,1,B000RO8UBU,"I had high expectations for MY WIFE AND MY DEAD WIFE, especially after reading some of the reviews. Now, I don't know what movie they saw, because this film wasn't worthy of five stars or four or even three. The best I can say was the DVD packaging was impressive. The artwork was eerie and colorful and had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. That was the good point. The disc itself was bad, it had no menu and when you tried to access it, the disc did funky things that made me think my DVD player was about to give up the ghost (yes, a bad pun). No chapter selections, no captions. It plays straight through. For the expensive price, they should've at least had a menu to access.

Then, there was the acting. It was terrible. The lead actor was horribly miscast. He was wooden and seemed to walk through his lines. I couldn't picture him lost in passion for anyone and that was a major point of the story, what little there was of it. The plot was never really fleshed out. Couple moves into house, man finds ghost in attic. Why was the ghost there? What was the story behind the ghostly woman? This was never explained and left a glaring hole in the story. The house itself emoted more passion and terror than the actors did. The ghost wasn't scary and didn't inspire passion. She just hung around alot, kinda like teenagers do. Maybe that was it, she was a teenage ghost looking for the mall. That  makes more sense than this movie did.

So, my take on MY WIFE AND MY DEAD WIFE is avoid the whole thing. It was dead on arrival. I love horror films and I can forgive a lot. But this was just bad. Really bad. Sorry. I really wanted to like this:(",1191196800,6,1655,4.264331210191083
8201717,5,B000RO8UBU,"This movie stayed with me long after I viewed it.  I hope you'll like it as much as I did; and you will if you like ""real life"" endings rather than ""happily ever after"".",1188345600,2,169,3.9705882352941178
8201718,2,B000RO8UBU,I bought this dvd based on the positive reviews posted here at Amazon. If you want to see just how dull characters can be ... watch this. I'd recommend renting rather than purchasing.,1188086400,2,183,4.575757575757576
8201719,4,B000RO8UBU,"I saw this movie in the theater, and I was very impressed.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Hitchcock, the Blair Witch Project, or similar movies.",1187913600,2,162,4.586206896551724
8201720,3,B000RO8UBU,"This smart, disturbing film embodies the best elements of its genre: the emotional and mental demise of Graham, the main character, is inceasing reflected in an altered reality, and the fine line he walks between external and internal monsters becomes increasingly treacherous. A fine study of what can happen when a loveless marriage and meaningless work are pitted against the possibility of real passion.",1187222400,4,407,5.375
