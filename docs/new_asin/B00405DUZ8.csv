8412076,3,B00405DUZ8,"This was more like Elevators 101.  It said very little about being trapped in an elevator.  I would have liked to know what to do if that happens.  Should one sing ""99 Bottles of Beer""?  Should you write your autobiography in your head?  How do you not avoid going insane?  How do you protect your liver and kidneys?  None of that is touched here.

This will allay fears.  The person trapped in an elevator got a settlement, but it was not in the 7 figures as I would have guessed.  The work says 40,000 Americans die each year in car accidents compared to 27 in elevators, and those are mostly elevator personnel.  It stresses that cities could not have become bigger w/o this invention.  It made it seem like deaths from falling elevators hasn't happened this century.  It goes on to say movies love the elevator unsafety theme, but it is not based in reality.

This program was good if you like trivia.  It said the ""Door Close"" button is a sham.  It said 58,000 New Yorkers use elevators each day.  It spoke about the history and future of the device.  This was work was heavy on engineering.  As that field is not very diverse, the interviewees here are not that diverse, especially as the doc is based in New York City.

John Lithgow is the narrator.  Some may see him as the scary guy in ""Ricochet"" or the bossy man in ""3rd Rock.""  However, he seems like Middle-Aged Guy Next Door to me.  His friendly, harmless, hopeful voice is a key to making a potentially nail-biting subject more approachable.

This doc was a useful One To Grow On.",1290643200,3,1544,4.451612903225806
