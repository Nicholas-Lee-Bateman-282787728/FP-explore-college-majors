5896702,5,B00E8RVSFC,"I enjoyed the DVD very much, I wish that it was longer and contained newer tunes in addition to the old ones. The production quality was great, the lighting and sound was well done. Also the quality of the perfomance was superb. I am a long time fan of the Fantastic Violinairs and I was please to know that they released a new project, especially a live presentation. I was also happy to know that they consolidated the two exiting groups which gives us the best of the current violinaires. I would recomend it to any Violinaire fan, but don't expect an extended perfomance it right at an hour long which is still pretty good.",1382572800,,627,4.460869565217391
5896703,5,B00E8RVSFC,I really enjoyed this video. It is very inspirational. It brings back soooo many memories when Robert Blair was the leader. It is wonderful that Danny and Robert (members when Robert Blair was the leader) brought that wonderful harmony to this group. That harmony was really Fantastic.,1380844800,2,285,5.085106382978723
