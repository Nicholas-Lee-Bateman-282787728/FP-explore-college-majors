6788925,2,B00P80Y3JG,This really deserves one star but I don't like using the word hate to describe a movie. I am greatly disappointed in  every area of this film but the worst part is the use of toy electric static guns throughout the entire film. As a dvd collector with over 300 martial arts films I can say in all honesty I buy them for the fight scenes and I don't expect good acting. The acting in this was awful across the board. The fight scenes appear to still be in the walk through stages when they filmed it and of course the plot was completely senseless. Truly my advice is not to waste your time even to see it for free.,1423612800,2,614,4.116666666666666

6788932,3,B00P80Y3JG,"having seen my share of martial arts film i can say i have seen better but it may have suffered from a small budget but to not have a gunblast not sound like a gunblast i ,m gratly disappointed by the show was just okay but as i said it may have suffered from a small budget if that the case it was good rather than okay",1438387200,3,320,3.791044776119403
6788933,1,B00P80Y3JG,Stay away from this disaster of a movie,1430092800,,39,4.0
6788934,4,B00P80Y3JG,"No, this is not the Matrix and doesn't pretend to have the budget of a major Hollywood picture nor does the movie take itself too seriously... except when it comes to its fight scenes.  The main thing that jumps out at you watching this movie is that many of the characters are martial artists and have a wide array of skills.  It's obvious that Jino Kang, the lead star/writer/director, has considerable skill making movies but really shines as a master in martial arts.  Overall, Weapon of Choice is an enjoyable movie especially for those interested in martial arts.  I'm looking forward to watching anything else Jino Kang makes next.",1426204800,3,638,4.825688073394495
6788935,4,B00P80Y3JG,"I enjoyed the movie very much. It was filled with action and the warehouse  was awesome. The plot was good and Jino Kang's Hapkido technique was right on. If your style is related to Hapkido, Jujitsu or Aikijujitsu, you should see this movie. I Look forward to his next project.",1424131200,3,278,4.56
8686717,1,B00P80Y3JG,"Horrible. Amateurish. Stilted acting. A joke. A complete waste of time.
One star is way too high.",1533945600,,97,4.764705882352941
8686718,5,B00P80Y3JG,very entertaining low budget action movie  it was fun,1532736000,,53,4.888888888888889
8686719,1,B00P80Y3JG,"Sh. acting. A fight (at the beginning) that was too slow gave the 1st hint.
Don't waste your time!",1525132800,,98,4.2105263157894735
8686720,3,B00P80Y3JG,"sorry piper, i would have given it 4 stars except for the audio.",1524960000,,64,4.0
8686721,4,B00P80Y3JG,I thought for a low budget film it was pretty well done.,1524873600,,56,3.75
8686722,3,B00P80Y3JG,"Its OK.  Everyone is a martial arts expert, but no one can act fluidly.  I did watch the whole movie.",1524700800,,101,4.0
8686723,4,B00P80Y3JG,"I don't know what the people who left one-star reviews expected. Greek philosophy? This movie is true to its title, and competently made. The premise of an unarmed, unmasked assassin is original. The big letdown is the occasional genre-standard scenes where bad guys patiently wait in line for their turn to be whacked one at a time.",1524355200,3,333,4.859649122807017
8686724,4,B00P80Y3JG,"Good story, good acting, a step above a B movie, action packed",1524182400,,62,4.25
8686725,4,B00P80Y3JG,"Is this really a 4 star movie?  Prolly not...  I'm being generous here based on the indie factor ( I tried looking up the budget, but I couldn't find it...  I doubt it is shoe-string, but I can't imagine it being all ""that"" much... )

So...  in terms of ""action"" movies...  this movie actually involved a lot more characters / players than your typical girl gets kidnapped by bad guy, good guy goes to save her flick...  AND...  they actually gave some of those characters at least a little bit of depth...  it's actually kind of impressive in that regard...

Acting was all over the board...  some was quite good...  some was awful...  in general, I'd say ""most"" of it was par-ish or better for indie...

Camera work and lighting was fine...

I liked the special effects...  You can immediately tell they were done on the cheap side, but they also avoided garbage CGI at the same time...  Honestly, I appreciate the what looked like paint balls hitting people over some 3 year old using microsoft paint to toss on fake blood...  :D...  And most of the knife slashes / sword slashes actually looked surprisingly good...

The fight choreography was for the most part really well done...  Borderline pro in several scenes...  However there were a few that were ""meh""...  Overall really good work by all involved...  I particularly liked a couple of the sword fights towards the end...  That said, this movie could have used a few of Jackie Chan's how to do a fight scene on the cheap techniques to make them look even cooler ( put some flour on your shoes so you get a ""poof"" of dust when someone connects...  etc...  I think they ""may"" have used his technique of strapping a line to someone and pulling them so when they get hit they ""fall"" further, but it was hard to tell... )...  Any case...  75%+ of the fight scenes looked pretty cool to me...

Audio is where this movie is killing me...  I'm an audiophile...  The audio for the fights actually sounded REALLY good...  punches landing etc sounded great...  and the soundtrack wasn't bad...  but audio during conversation was hit / miss...  There was no peaking ( thank you ), however there were multiple scenes where audio was so low that I could barely hear what people were saying...  ( I actually flipped on sub-titles, just to make sure I didn't miss anything important...  )  I don't work on movies, but I do work on some amateur music...  You've GOT to normalize your levels to like -3 or -0.1 db...  10 to 1 if I had a copy of the audio track to this movie I could fix it in like 30 mins...

Anyway...  to wrap this up...  again...  is the movie 4 star?  nah...  it really isn't...  BUT...  is it entertaining?  yeah...  does it have an interesting plot line?  I think so...  does it have action?  a whole bunch, and a lot of it done really well...  It's also got some outlandish junk in there, but whatever...  it's a movie...  :D",1523318400,,2892,4.4854932301740815
