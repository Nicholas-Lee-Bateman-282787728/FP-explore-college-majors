7981514,1,B00008DDRF,"If you want to learn about what purports to be a history of the apostles from someone (Melvyn Bragg) who does not believe in the divinity of Jesus or in the resurrection, then this is the dvd series for you.

Pure speculation and lack of credentials to make such a sweeping survey makes this a series a big fail.",1380240000,3,312,4.288135593220339
7981515,1,B00008DDRF,"I got as far as the first episode about Peter where they describe Peter as a man who was partly real, partly fiction.
This is a pseudo-academic, pseudo-religious farce created from an unbelieving viewpoint. It doesn't harm my faith, but I'm not going to waste my time on half-truths posing as authority. The ""story"" as it is entitled, is not wholly in accord with the Biblical account of Peter. I don't need some unbeliever holding my hand and deciding for me what is real.",1359676800,5,473,4.642857142857143
7981516,5,B00008DDRF,"If you are wondering as to what happened to the Apostles after Jesus left them, this is a good and informative book.",1355961600,,116,4.318181818181818
7981517,3,B00008DDRF,"This 4 hour DVD tackles a difficult subject matter - the apostles of Jesus.  The subject is difficult because we have so little information about the apostles.  As a result, the author presents a lot of conjecture and unfortunately conjecture was occasionally presented as fact.  Nevertheless, the DVD does make for a useful overview of the 12 (and Mary Magdalene) along with interesting details gleaned from the Bible, information regarding the time and places of their lives, as well as traditions that have flowed down to us through the centuries.",1291766400,3,550,5.088888888888889
7981518,5,B00008DDRF,"Well! I hardly dare say anything after the condemnation of this title by a self-styled ""real Christian"" (Rebecca) in the review below. Her use of the term ""Heretical"" reveals her mind set; this term, little used since the Middle Ages, is indicative of a narrow, bigoted, authoritarian religious view point which has little in common with any of Christ's teaching.

For the record, this is a calm, well researched, reverent examination of the Apostles and their relationship with Jesus. No extreme conspiracy-type elements are included, let alone the Da Vinci code nonsense referenced by that reviewer. Rather does it emphasize the strength of the spiritual relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, reverencing her as the ""thirteenth Apostle"". Although to the fundamentalists, the thought of a woman being included in such a club is no doubt anathema. Folks, try looking at the big picture; your fears and prejudices are so petty!",1163635200,13,935,5.233333333333333
7981519,1,B00008DDRF,"I bought this for my eleven year old son but found out (luckily before he saw it) that it is an heretical piece of trash.

First, it subscribes to an early heresy that was condemend by even the earliest Christians, namely that Jesus Christ was oblivious to His own divinity.

Secondly, it apparently buys into the Da Vinci Code blasphemy of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ having an illicit relationship.  Istead of sinner and Savior it makes their relationship into something far more base.

I wasted $25 on this movie and it went straight into the trash.  Do NOT buy it if you are a real Christian.",1163376000,18,600,4.570093457943925
7981520,5,B00008DDRF,"It was a soul lifting experience to watch this ten-part series revealing the lives and identities of Apostles (together with Mary Magdalene) in the story that became Christianity and has become a integral part of the Church ever since. Unlike the Apostles Collection DVD set released by the History Channel which contained too much reenactments and dramatizations of the events to explain things, this series goes further deep to take you beyond the icons to reveal the flesh-and-blood pillars of the early church. The series has ten episodes, namely:

1. Peter
2. Andrew
3. John
4. James
5. Matthew
6. Thomas
7. Bartholomew and Philip
8. James, Thaddeus (Jude) and Simon
9. Judas
10. Mary Magdalene

Each episode focuses on the featured Apostle and looks more closely at his life by examining the many facts and details through fascinating historical and biblical evidence. The series unveils many of the sites made sacred by the visitation of Apostles in their mission to spread the gospel to every part of the world. It was absolutely soul stirring to learn about the manner of martyrdom of each Apostle and to witness the Holy relics (even skulls) of some of the Apostles kept in various churches erected in their remembrance, which today attract millions of pilgrims all over the world. To be able to view the cave on the island of Patmos where Apostle John received the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ was so blessed and blissful. It was also quite remarkable to learn of the impact and the legacy, the Apostles have left on the cities/countries they visited. The remarks of renowned biblical scholars, experts, and members of the clergy were very helpful in understanding the story of early Christianity. The narration throughout the series was excellent. This series has definitively made me aware of many important facts about the Apostles which I never knew or could have otherwise known. After watching this 260 minutes series, I felt like I had been to a pilgrimage. It is a kind of experience one should share with the people of his/her Church. I would strongly recommend everyone reading this review to purchase this series before it goes out of stock.",1096070400,48,2170,4.926229508196721
