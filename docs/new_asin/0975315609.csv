This video seems to have been produced earlier, and a lot of it was shot with a single camera on a tripod run by Helge.  So far I have picked one or two things that I can now do, and did not know before.  So that brings it to about $15.00 per tip.  Worth it?  Possibly!",1275350400,,506,3.9603960396039604

Of the remaining  there is run through of product available from the authors sponsor followed in-depth look at the author's camera bag. The advise to adjust your suspension properly, to carry the tools you use on your bike whiles at home and to fill the space in your fuse box with spares is all very good but not worth the extravagant cost of the DVD.",1257638400,,476,4.386363636363637
