2522408,5,B000EMG922,"That I bought this movie orginally to see David Boreanaz naked. I am very glad that I did. It is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of David's nice tush in the movie. If you have ever been a baby sitter in your life, you will get a hoot out of this one.",1164585600,7,255,3.6545454545454548
2522409,3,B000EMG922,This movie is fun and holds your interest.  It is a kind of shoe is on the other foot where the girls are in charge.  What they come up with in sharing a guy is really good.  You can't help but like the girls and their choice of who to spend their summer with is one most of us would make.  If you like David Boreanaz you will like this movie.,1154908800,2,343,3.788732394366197
2522410,3,B000EMG922,"Okay, first confession: I will watch and buy anything that stars David Boreanaz. I just love the big lug, and it's been really fun to watch him improve as an actor over the years. Second confession: my favorite part of the movie was David naked, and David playing a big pothead.

That's... about all this movie has going for it. None of the leads are in any way sympathetic. In fact, I thought all four of them (including David's character Keith) were HIDEOUS human beings... and not in a fun way. The plot the three girls hatch is simply unbelievable, and Keith Too Stupid To Live for letting it happen to him. Not to mention he's completely gross for being ""that guy"" that hangs around banging high school girls well into his 30's.

So... see it for David, if you're a fan. If not, I sincerely doubt your life will be any less rich for having missed it.",1151884800,12,855,4.405063291139241
2522411,4,B000EMG922,"I enjoy many David Boreanaz movies I quickly moved from Buffy, to Angel,& watched all the movies in between but this movie truly shows Boreanaz' wide scope of acting, the movie itself reminded me of the Breakfast Club movie theme of 3 young teenagers graduating highschool and relating there summer fun story to the viewers and how it helped them i'd like to say mature in a way, but i'll keep with move on. A town hunk gets caught sleeping with one of the 3 girls, the other two decide to blackmail him, so they may have what they think of as mature, adult, sex with a ""real"" man , what happens instead is an uproar of laughter, & a goodtime. I felt Boreanaz was cut short in The Crow and wasn't allowed to show his full scope of acting, but fortunately not in this movie, he is absolutely charming , hilariously funny, and shows there is no limit to his acting capabilities, If your a fan of summer fun movies, this one is for you.",1148428800,5,933,4.306818181818182
2522412,3,B000EMG922,"sorry, but I'm not a comedy person (at least not this kind of silly comedy). I'm a big DB fan that's why I saw it in the first place. The actings are all great, I like it very much that David is trying different things. the directing....yeah sure I couldn't really judge since I don't see anything spetacular. The problem I have is simply the storyline. It is just S-I-L-L-Y, senseless and at times the sillyness just gets so tiresome. This is the kind of movie in which if you just want a good laugh (that is, if you think this kind of meaningless comedy is funny) it's the right movie for ya. But even though I did laugh, by the end of the movie I just felt this complete tiresome feeling from all the nonsense. It is just...fandangle.

so yeah, watch it if you are this kind of comedy person and/or you are a DB die-hard fan. if not, avoid it.",1148169600,4,846,4.222222222222222
2522413,5,B000EMG922,"I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival and all the buzz was David Boreanaz is shirtless and naked through most of the movie. Well, I was more than surprised by the direction, plot, acting, and pacing of this excellent coming of age comedy. The acting bodes well all around. Caroline Dhavernas is terrific as the sly, spunky friend and fans of ""Wonderfalls"" will love this character. Amanda Walsh is really shining on ""Sons & Daughters"" and gives an excellent performance as the romantic, heart-broken friend. But most of all, these two characters are rounded out by the funniest on screen representation of repressed sexualtiy gone haywire. Holly Lewis gets the 'Most Akward' and 'Most Humorous' sex scene award. I mean this beats that  scene in Forrest Gump in Genny's dorm room. Lewis is absolutely genius in this role.  Boreanaz as always is a plus and not because he's naked (although many will disagree), but because he delivers a strong performance that will be a happy surprise to his Angel fans and a delight to everyone in general. I would definitely buy this movie. Hazlett is an excellent director with a brilliant sense of style and sound (this movie has a great soundtrack) and brings out some great performancesfrom all his actors. It is worth it just to watch the very original opening title sequence - a designer's delight. Overall it's a terrrific sleeper hit.",1145318400,41,1383,4.8559322033898304
2522424,2,B000EMG922,Another disappointment & surprise. Thankfully he has changed his choice in parts as he is better than this & especially in Ghost Writer. I m afraid to watch any other film prior to his work on Angel etc. Again not that my opinion matters.,1478908800,,238,4.431818181818182

Some parts are really uncomfortable to watch because of the age the girls are playing in this movie. I suppose it's meant to be funny and not suggesting such behavior is ok because it is not.

2522536,1,B000EMG922,"I will echo the sentiment that this film is garbage. Nasty pairing of close-to-rape and/or sexual abuse of girls who simply don't know any better. OK, I am not a prude by any means, just an adult with this crazy notion that marriage means one partner. Monogamy is such an outdated concept for the youthful gen, that some will find this film funny. I don't but that's just because it's all too real for so many young girls who just want to think they are grownup. Hint: They aren't, no matter what they think they know or understand. As the film progressed, I began to feel nauseous, just for the fact that Boreanz's character didn't appear to have a moral bone(r) in his body...Enter my arguably diffident side, with the idea that everyone has a first time, but why use this theme to express how awkward and innocent we all were, once.  I fail to see the humor.  The real facts are this type of event makes the not-for-prime-time news every day.  It's behavior like this that leads to dull thoughts, helpless emotions tumbling around in a kids head....One girl says, ""L love him""...over and over.  Of course she does, she doesn't yet know what love is!  The guy was not the victim, he was the source of a problem which in our laid back society is apparently acceptable.  Yeah, they director and producer thought they could toss a few teenaged angst scenes in to cover what I saw as sheer stupidity in a situation where honesty and moral values get tossed aside. That's what passes for comic in this country, and others, I am certain. Americans didn't invent stupid, they just seem not to mind being so, IMO.
Some may think this is a comedy, and I suppose that's their choice, so have at it. I just don't like seeing the hollyfraud vain attempt to put the fun and harmless spin on what has become practically a global lack of decency. That's hard-nosed, and I don't care. BTW, if anyone was looking for Boreanz's naked butt, it was located on top of his shoulders! Guy couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. He should stick to beefcake, but like everyone else, his age doesn't help the once famous bikini-boy bimbo. What a joke!",1434412800,6,2133,4.498708010335918

2522561,4,B000EMG922,"This movie is actually one that I enjoy while not really being okay with. The basic premise is a man is having an affair with a girl half his age, her friends find out and blackmail him into having sex with them to. The actor is hot. The girls are pretty, and I like the story. There are things about this movie that I hate.
1. Morally I hate the principle of this movie. Blackmailing someone to have sex with you is Rape. It may be nonviolent but it's still rape. I am not okay with that in any form. I'm just fine with it if someone wants to bang someone half their age. As long as they actually want to.
2. Clinical sex makes me nauseous. I'd rather have someone walk in and catch me watching Hard core porn than have someone catch me watching something where sex is treated like a classroom. (not talking about the penchant some people have for dressing up like catholic school girls that's a whole different kind of kink that I'm perfectly fine with)That's a personal thing. Not actually anything the movie did wrong.
Things I loved
1. Keith Clark. This guy's biggest mistake is letting sex charged teenage girls into his house. He's the guy that stands up for the kid being picked on.  He's got a nice wife and a cute kid and his income on the side, and a hot babysitter that offers sex, what would any man with questionable morals do? The baby sitter. He doesn't go after them, he's just there living his life. And because he decided that it'd be okay to go ahead and sleep with one barely legal girl. His whole life practically falls apart.  It would be so easy to hate this character but his charisma is hard to resist. I adore how mundane he is.
2. Grubber.  Okay, that may seem like a strange character to love but I really like this kid. He's mentally challenged and gets picked on all the time. It doesn't matter, he's so sweet and innocent I can't help but like him. Even though the girls are the villains he tries to stand up for them.  That kind of honest friendship is so nice to see.
3. The girls. Okay, I don't like the girl that much as a whole. I think they are the most self involved morons I've seen in a while, mostly because when I see self involved morons I change the channel. I do like them though individual personalities make up for their annoying together.

Gloria:  I like the way that Glory actually thinks she loves the guy and they have a future. She refuses to see that she's just an easy lay. I like that about her. She goes along with it because it's her friends and she doesn't want to give him up. I felt sorry for her.

Lisa: Mock innocence and baseball what more can you want from a girl. She reminds me of me at like 10 while I was still naive and innocent. Her belief system is a core part of her personality yet she's learned to justify anything that she wants to do in order to make it fit into her beliefs and she does it seamlessly almost like she doesn't even realize she's doing it.

Kiera: The brains of the operation. If anyone could have called off their game it was her. She was confident, manipulative, aggressive, and genuinely the type of person I could be friends with. Forget everything that says about me.
This movie is not a thinker. If you try to over think it you'll end up hating it. Just enjoy the pretty girls manipulating the pretty man and it'll be your favorite movie.",1355097600,,3337,4.285714285714286
2522562,1,B000EMG922,"I only bought this movie because I am a DB fan but this was just a low budget movie and it shows. The plot could of been funny but just wasn't to me - maybe because I found all the acting painful. You do get to see DB's tush so if that is what your after you will like that part of it. Otherwise, this was not a good movie at all. So glad I bought it used for a few bucks.",1346371200,,372,3.548780487804878
2522563,4,B000EMG922,"Overall a surprisingly funny movie that I did not expect, especially with the cheesy opening credits and relatively unknown cast in a Canadian film.
The story follows three high school friends, during their last summer before going off to college or other adventures. Enter stage left, the local hot married guy who they all end up bedding. And well, things get sort of complicated.
And yes, if you like David Boreanaz, you do get an ass shot, though he is not naked the entire film, contrary to misleading rumors. David did a good job with this part as well, and wasn't just a pretty face.
The story was different, good writing, excellent comedy, and acting.  Throw in some nice directing and viola, a good movie!
All and all, I was impressed. A good movie from the kanucks, no less!
I would totally buy this for my collection.",1330300800,,828,4.63265306122449
2522564,5,B000EMG922,"Way better than I expected based on the jacket blurb. This is hip and smart and not at all the shallow mess it would have been if Hollywood had been involved. None of the actors are well known, but they all perform well as part of a big romantic triangle involving a 30-something man and a cute plot by some teen girls to trap him into having sex with all of them while his wife works. The roles are all well delineated and the dialogue is whip smart. You will be very pleasantly surprised by this Canadian indie movie.",1313971200,,519,4.252525252525253

I was unsure to be honest if this DVD would even work as I'm in Australia, and I did received a notification from Amazon that it possibly would not work,  but I went ahead with the purchase as I couldn't find this DVD anywhere in Australia.

Delivery was super quick... my shipping details advised that it would take up to 6 weeks to arrive... I got it in 2 weeks....

The product was packaged well... sealed correctly and works like a dream!!

Thanks Amazon... I will definitely be making other purchases in the future.",1292025600,,580,4.495238095238095

2522579,3,B000EMG922,"It seems I'm the only one who got it because it starred Caroline Dhavernas rather than Buffy's ""Angel"", and generally to me she was the best part of the picture, which was on the whole far fetched and shallow, but still mildly entertaining.

If you are a Caroline fan, as I am, it would probably be worth you 2-4 dollars, to buy, but one viewing would probably suffice, so just hit the blockbuster.",1238803200,,398,4.4520547945205475

And as for the girls, they should have just left him alone, and as for the first one ahe should have used protection and understand that it wasn't love but S$$ itslf. Blonde, and niave, she should have known better.
As for David chacter, he should have payed more attention and should have spoke to his wife about the situation, maybe everyone would have walked out happy, and he would have learne his lesson another way---never cheat on your wife, because it'll come back to haunt you.

Perks: DB practically naked throughout the entire thing.....that is basically it.
Downfalls: The story was only so so. If only there had been a better story line, or if it had been constructed better.
Still, I give this movie a grand round of applause.",1198886400,2,408,4.311688311688312
2522582,4,B000EMG922,"I bought this movie for David Boreanaz and enjoyed it very much. As for the plot, I think it's more realistic than you might imagine, and not nearly so bad as some of the stuff that actually goes on in the real world. I certainly don't think the characters are awful people, just flawed like most.

As for the actors, of course, I think David Boreanaz was great, though I could have done without the do-rag (not sure how to spell that) on his head. I thought Caroline Dhavernas was great in her part and has beautiful eyes. The other two were good actors, though I found their characters a little bit annoying. The baseball freak/7th Day Adventist was a real hoot.",1182384000,5,664,4.442622950819672
2522583,4,B000EMG922,"David Boreanaz stars as Keith Clark, belongs to some sort of biker gang & I'm not overly sure what his real job is but it's not overly important. Amanda Walsh(Canadians would know her as a VJ from Much Music) plays Glory Lorraine, who is the first to fall for Keith's ""charms"" & starts sleeping with him behind his wife's back. but then it gets worse, not only does she think she's in love with him but her friend, Keira(Caroline Dhavernas) sleeps with him as well. & then her other friend Lisa(Holly Lewis) decides she wants to sleep with him too to get herself pregnant. & then they all start telling each other that their sleeping with Keith without knowing their friends are also doing him. & after a long fight they slowly decide to start sharing and blackmail him to make sure he doesn't back out. I have to say, David is definitely willing to try new things here! his character is very twisted and dark, he has alot of shame in sleeping with these girls while he's married but does nothing about it. well, in the end he tries to find a way out of it but it only backfires as he gets what's coming to him. this film is silly, at times way too cheesy for its own good. lots of things don't make sense, there's no real lesson in the entire thing and I'm not sure why Keira has a change of heart at the end of the movie. it just seemed so random & stupid. this movie is sinful, funny, cheesy & I think overall, it's worth a viewing!",1168732800,3,1435,4.26007326007326
2522584,1,B000EMG922,"After reading the editor's review I was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge Buffy / Angel / Bones fan.  Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered.  Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it.  I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through.  This movie was terrible.  The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen.  Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan!  What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?!",1165708800,6,584,4.302752293577981
8111162,5,B000EMG922,"I've been watching indie movies all day because they're free and I was disappointed by them all until I got to this one. It's a little bit funny and a little bit sexy if you can get past the cheating. The 'sharing' doesn't bother me because they all knew about it eventually and I thought it would lead to a more practical realization for one of the girls - in fact, the only thing that frustrated me was how long it took one of the girls to get a clue. Caroline Dhavernas (you might recognize her from Hannibal) was very nearly the arguable villain of this movie, in my opinion, so that was kind of funny. I thought the end was practical and upbeat. Maybe only a 3.9 star movie, but the actresses and actor were all awesome ones I recognized from other places and I enjoyed that aspect hence the five stars. I enjoyed the music they used. If you're a little prudish about sexuality, weed, cheating (which was where my suspension of enjoyment, lets call it, was tested) then this probably won't be fun for you. Not much nudity, not incredibly graphic (it was more the situations than anything). In fact, I almost think their montage of the 'arrangement' could have lasted a little longer so we could the honeymoon years of its duration. And those are my thoughts.",1515456000,,1263,4.471861471861472

Its plot of underage girls blackmailing an older guy to bang them is not done with enough humor to get you past that big plot point. It seems like one of those films that thought it was being edgy and independent and was just blech. Boreanaz is looking very nice naked. girls were forgettable,1491523200,,394,4.337837837837838
