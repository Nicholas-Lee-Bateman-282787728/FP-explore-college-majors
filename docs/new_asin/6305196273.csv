998054,5,6305196273,"An excellent adaptation of the story.  I could have easily enjoyed an eight hour (rather than just six) version.  Paul McGann was terrific (as always) as the bored Eugene Wrayburn in need of something--anything--to  give his life meaning.  The entire cast is excellent as are the costumes,  settings, and script.",916444800,,312,5.16
998055,4,6305196273,"This production of Charles Dickens' 1864 novel reminds the viewer why classics are classics; its themes are surprisingly modern. Characters deal with stalkers and blackmailers, they worry about the moral repercussions of  wealth and poverty, they find themselves attracted to relationships with  the wrong people. Beautifully acted by a British cast, with a muted yet  powerful central performance by Steven Mackintosh as the Mutual Friend,  John Harmon, this version keeps the scary parts scary, and the funny parts  funny. The love-sick stalker, Bradley Headstone, is as frightening as any  modern psycho conjured up on the X-Files. The screenwriter wisely excises  some of Dicken's gooier sentimentality regarding women and children, and  focuses on the moral and intellectual growth of the female characters, as  well as the central themes of the interrelation of identity and money. The  only reason I deny this production a five star rating is that it leaves out  the unforgettable Mr. Podsnap, one of Dicken's greatest and most hilarious  character portraits of hypocritical society at its worst. Otherwise, the  six-hour long mini-series is utterly engrossing and well worth your time.",915753600,5,1193,5.489010989010989
998056,5,6305196273,"Having watched the PBS production of this film, I was very pleased with it's quality, which showed in every frame and each detail.  The actors were each alternately fiery and subtle, the location filming was exquisite, and  the small touches, like the change in color--one moment drab browns and  greys showing the wretched dust (garbage) bins and the denziens, then quick  cut to brilliant reds, yellows and golds when portraying the 'upper'  classes at their gossipy parties.  The script also deftly handled the many  characters and plot threads, that are a hallmark with Charles Dickens's  work, with ease and clarity.  EVERY literary adaption (and movies in  general) should be treated with this much intelligence and care.  Highly  recommended",915753600,,748,5.245762711864407
998057,5,6305196273,The choice of actors was so apt that the story became real to the viewer. You are taken directly into 19th century England with its collection of villians and heroes. The interplay of the various characters alone is  enough to enagage the viewer to say nothing of the brilliant acting. This  is an absolute MUST for fans of Charles Dickens.,915753600,,340,4.65
998058,5,6305196273,"I recently saw this production as a three-part miniseries, and I was thoroughly impressed.  Not having read the book, I was surprised at every twist of the plot, and honestly interested in every character.  The  screen-writing, casting, cinematography--the whole thing was just superb.  I would highly reccommend it to anyone, including younger viewers.  This  movie has action, drama, romance, and mystery, without any unnecessary  sordidness.  Something for everyone.",915667200,,469,5.794117647058823
998059,5,6305196273,This is a wonderful dramatization of one of Dickens best.  Where does the English theater come up with those wonderful character actors. You will almost need to take notes to keep up with the many interwoven plots and the  wonderful parade of characters. This has it all mystery and mayhem and  romance - heros and villians. And a great finis!,915580800,,343,4.683333333333334
998328,5,6305196273,"Will ""Our Mutual Friend"" scare the Dickens out of you?  Perhaps.  This story however, has a distinct difference from many of Dickens works.  It's uplifting!  Of course it contains eccentrics, misfits and malcontents as in other Dicken's classics.  What would a Dicken's tale be without the requisite rogues?  But there is also a genuine sweetness in this story.  The video production deftly allows the sweetness to shine through without a saccharin aftertaste.  No cheap melodrama here.  Just Oscar-caliber acting, supeberb cinematography, and a great musical score.  I'm confident that you will find ""Our Mutual Friend"" to be a friend indeed.",970790400,7,643,5.34
998329,5,6305196273,"I recently saw the rerun of this movie on Masterpiece Theater and  absolutely fell in love with it!  I can't wait until I get this video!  The  characters in this movie are wonderfully well-drawn and excellently  portrayed by the actors.  This is an unusual novel for Dickens, for it is  darker than we are used to, but the true Dickens shines through in the end.  Everything is wrapped up neatly and there are no threads of this story  left hanging.  There are many twists and turns in this story but I was  never confused.  There were a few surprises that sprung up at me during the  story but it worked very nicely.",961372800,,618,4.410714285714286
998330,5,6305196273,"I watched this production on Masterpiece Theater and the only bad thing about it was that it was divided into three parts, with the result that I was on the edge of my seat for three weeks.  At that time I had not read  the novel, but did read it after watching this production.  This film was  beautifully produced, well-written, well-acted and just purely exciting.  It is the best movie I have seen in a long time, on TV or in the theater.  These characters are some of the most marvelous Dickens ever created,  ranging from eccentric (Silas Wegg) to just plain odd (Mr. Venus) and from  very good (Lizzie) to terrifying (Bradley Headstone). This movie has it  all: greed, lust, madness, evil, innate goodness, love, romance, and  mystery.",939945600,12,742,4.682170542635659
998331,5,6305196273,I saw this on Masterpiece Theater on television and was absolutely delighted.  Paul McGann was excellent as Wrayburn and Steven Mackintosh is the quintessential John Harmon.  You'll adore this magnificently well made  film.,919468800,,223,5.696969696969697
7886248,5,6305196273,Great movie.  Read the book and loved the movie.  Shipper was awesome.,1518652800,,70,4.75

If you have a weekend you want to wast and it's raining & your dog died and momma is still in prison and the fridge is empty and the roaches won't go away - go for it....

7886250,4,6305196273,"The very first element that has to be said about this novel, or this work is that it is too intricate and characters are too complicated and intertwined in their motivations and even identities that we find it difficult to follow. The plot is slightly too thick for me.

The second element is the social cruelty of the story. Cruelty against the poor, the small, the lower classes. They are working like hell making their bosses rich and they are described as having no real human feelings, no real human dimension. They are like human animals living in dirt, squalor and bleakness. It is at times unbearable how little self-respect they may have for themselves, and as for that only a few, and very few women make an effort among these poor people to be clean and keep their house and household clean.

These poor are over-endowed with alcoholism and gross attitudes and habits, drinking late at night in dirty and in many ways disgusting public houses. And here is Dickens's social Darwinism. The upper classes are shown with all kinds of respectable qualities and everything is genteel with them. They drink in parties in glasses served to them on a tray by special servants, with music and beautiful dresses and suits. In these circles marriage has to be within one's own social rank, a type of social segregation particularly obnoxious, and marriage is first of all for money and nothing else, which is absolute hypocrisy, but at least in comfort and cleanliness, except for the abuse of cigars.

So think of the situation in this novel of a miser of no genteel extraction and with no respectable human sentiments, who made his fortune out of the heap of dirt and rubbish collected in London and deposited up some river and sorted out with shovels by some human rats. What's more being a miser he is rejected by everyone. So his decision to give all his fortune to his son whom no one knows at all provided he marries the woman this father has set for him in his will makes the whole thing melodramatic and overwrought.

So after a few murders and a lot of squalid events Dickens manages to bring up some happy ending for three young couples and an older one and a good old sound heavy moral lesson about doing what the heart is supposed to tell you to do and never be over-fascinated with money. But at the same time the only people who really suffer in this situation are the poor, even if they are shown as deserving that treatment. When you are born in the dregs of society your are bound to remain there and to end very badly.

A little bit short, Mr. Dickens, and your regenerated main character is regenerated only symbolically, and he could not be rejected to the end since he was born on the right side of the silver spoon, even if this silver spoon has to be called a garbage shovel.

7886251,5,6305196273,"I like Dicken's stories for his memorable characters.  The good are so kind and innocent and the villains so dispicable and evil.  This movie succeeds because it takes the time to develop the personalities and lives of these fascinating people.  I taped it from PBS over three nights.  Its six hours long and you won't want to miss a minute.

Dickens' rats and angels come from all manner of social strata in turn of the century England.  No one is free from Dickens scathing critique.  The plots are set amidst the backdrop of an aristocracy which is collapsing under its own weight.  The middle class grows and the born-rich are forced to socialize with ""new"" money.  How distasteful!  Even the poor are not immune to the social structure of the time;  a river boatman, who dredges the river for bodies, will not let his son go to school.  He must carry on the family trade, like his father did!

The casting and the acting is just right.  Oh, the faces of these actors and actresses say so much.  You will fall in love with the hero and heroine as they try to figure out what they should do.

I must admit, I like the evil guys!  They are simply awful to the core.  My favorite scene is when Riderhood unexpectedly shows up in the school teachers classroom sitting among the young pupils sharing his wisdom.  After his little speech, he ruffles a boys hair.  I wanted to douse the poor lad's head in lice shampoo.  But, there are a lot of neer-do-wells in this story who need their comeuppance and Dickens doesn't fail to deliver!

The movie is filmed in a rainy London.  The scenery and locations are wonderful.  The costumes perfect.  I love period peices and this one ranks up there with the best of them.",1127088000,3,1711,4.495114006514658
7886252,5,6305196273,"Thats right, this is by far the best period piece I have ever seen.  With dark and brooding characters, lovely scenery and things that are not what they seem, this was truly a wonderful viewing experience.

BBC, make more movies like this.

Enjoy!",1108684800,,247,4.6976744186046515

7886254,5,6305196273,"I love the BBCs costume dramas like Middlemarch and Pride and Prejudice, but because I hadn't enjoyed Oliver Twist when I read it I expected that anything by Dickens would be heavy going. How wrong I was!
I finished watching it yesterday afternoon and intend to watch some of my favourite bits and the beginning over again today so I can see how characters were brought in, as with so many people in it, it takes a while to establish who's who and which characters are central, for instance I paid little attention to the character of Eugene Wrayburn in the first episode and later on he becomes central.
The story is multi-layered and to outline it simply  - a dead body is found in the thames, a mutual friend, whose discovery draws together the lives of many people, the dead mans lawyer, Mortimer, and Eugene his friend, the man who found the body Gaffer Hexam and his children Lizzy and Charlie, Bella the girl who the dead mans father had choosen for him to marry, the Boffins who now inherit the fortune and the mysterious John Rokesmith, Boffins secretary who insists on viewing the body, and shows a marked interest in Bella.

The film is beautifully shot and the costumes are gorgeous. The story is complex and realistic and doesn't fall into simplification. And as for the characters - they are so real and 3D and the performances are just right.
 I particulary enjoyed the love triangle between the spoilt, lazy, cynical Eugene, the innocent, intelligent Lizzy and the repressed later crazed school teacher, it had me in tears at one point and although it led to a happy ending it didn't feel cliched because the performances are so believeable and it was so sensitivly handled. Paul McGann gives a especially good performance as Eugene, among a very strong cast, all the actors are great, the bone collecter, the dolls dressmaker and the Boffins (none of whose names I can remember) stand out in particular as does Anna Friel as Bella .
This is the first story I couldn't wait to see more of since I read the English Patient, I watched it in five 'sittings' and rushed to do other things so I could get them finished so I had time to sit down and watch more!!! It really was that good, well done BBC!",1081555200,2,2213,4.569269521410579
7886255,5,6305196273,"In this BBC miniseries ""Our Mutual Friend"", every bit of bittersweet of life is conveyed most incisively. It is a quite lengthy (three-tape of totally 339 min) production, and yet, with all the drama - life and death, love and hatred, passion and thriller - to tighten the grip, you won't feel the time once you start watching. It is a quite complicated plot with many characters, and yet, it is unfolded methodically such that you will actually enjoy the dimensions and dynamics.
Strongly sensed, while watching this 1860s story, is its close relevance to the realities of true life, even modern life. The drama of John Harmon and his inheritance, around which the whole story is extended, exemplifies the struggle between love and money, which is a constant battle ever going on. The ending of young Harmon winning his true love without his money and Bella Wilfer, John's designated bride, finding her true self, fathoms the root of noble humanities. In character Lizzie Hexam there is writer's idealism, which made this boatman's daughter bearing unique grace and beauty although without any education. Luckily the truthfulness of the love between Lizzie and Eugene Wrayburn can be found in real life and so is its result - a magic of love - that's revealed in the story.
There is no writer who could better dig into human natures and create edgy characters than Charles Dickens. In this final work of him, the broadly and deeply depicted characters, ranging from the upper crust to the lowest rung, prove for another time that he is truly the master. The actors and actresses, who have brought life to the characters, even the smallest ones, have played the roles to the bones. Needless to say this masterwork deserves such fine craft. Only if such fine work can be released on DVD, it'd be perfect.",1042848000,3,1803,4.8381877022653725
7886256,5,6305196273,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a masterful adaptation of the sometimes wordy Dickens. Having read the book, I must say that whoever adapted this script was very skillful. Characters who were not as interesting were pushed into the background (Fledgeby and Gerogianna Podsnap were eliminated altogether) leaving the way clear for the much more facinating characters.
I enjoyed all of the preformances. As to Stephen Mackintosh, his character has been betrayed, thought to be dead and is in a terrible moral dilema. One cannot expect him to leap for joy under such circumstansces. Plus, it's so much cooler when he finally loses his temper at the end.
My favorite part of the movie is the Lizzie/Eugene/Headstone love triangle. Eugene's world weariness is played subtley and Lizzie's innocence is never over done. As for Headstone, nervous breakdowns are very hard to do without looking silly and this actor manages to be scary and pathetic at once, it really adds a lot to the plot.
The music is just perfect, the costumes are great (Bella's white ball gown is amazing) and the sets are ideal.
I should warn people that the first tape is very hard to get into the first time out. Maybe it is too dark with too many characters at once. I considered turning it off after the first twenty minutes. However, get past the first tape and you will be hopelessly addicted.
One more thing. The movie is 5-6 hours, not 2, so there is plenty of time to savour the action.",995241600,,1478,4.688461538461539
7886257,5,6305196273,"This production is beautifully filmed, filled with gorgeous actors and actresses and intricately detailed.  While being true to Dickens' complexities, it wraps up all the loose ends and (I'm giving it away) has a happy ending.  It vividly paints the good guys good and the bad guys despicable, yet everyone is a little more than meets the eye.  The love story is sweet and sincere, but Dickens, as always, shows us the dark underside of the human soul.  This film deftly winds us in its web and keeps us on the edge of our seats, leaving us satisfied yet a little haunted.",975369600,8,572,4.578431372549019
