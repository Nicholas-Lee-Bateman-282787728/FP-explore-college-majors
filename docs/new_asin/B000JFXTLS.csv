8150195,1,B000JFXTLS,"Boring and poorly, no, laughably, made documentary based on interviews with people associated with Muse at some point - there is almost no information here that you can't get by reading things on the web and the added value of the video is blurry shots of some anonymous band playing live while the narrator talks about Muse playing live and slow motion pans across recording boards while the narrator talks about Muse being in the recording studio. Really, really, bad and mostly useless.",1232323200,7,489,4.903614457831325
8150196,4,B000JFXTLS,"OK you guys, lest you think otherwise, this is strictly a documentary about this brilliant band.  The producers make a point of informing us from the beginning that Muse is not affiliated with its production and that there will be NO music by Muse played on the DVD whatsoever.  They certainly did a good job of that, and I was disapointed at first, but very glad to own this little glimpse of their Muse's history, as discussed by various sound engineers, local music magazine writers & pub workers, as well as interview snippets from Chris, Dom & Matt themselves...  If you are a true fan & collector, this DVD is well worth owning, but if you want splices & samples of tunes, even live, you're just out of luck......",1185926400,29,719,4.558139534883721
