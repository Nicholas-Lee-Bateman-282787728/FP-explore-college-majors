6433953,5,B00KMJBDFA,"These two are the perfect pair - They play off each other brilliantly, a joy to watch and the Italian scenery is worth the watch alone. I recommend seeing the first they did ""The Trip"" - (so funny I laughed till I cried,) to understand their relationship and how their lives have changed. Had I not seen the first, I would not have understood where they are now in their lives. and why they do what they do. This film is not quite as hilarious as the first,
but still enjoyable to watch these two masters work together and off each other.",1411257600,9,538,4.284313725490196
6433954,4,B00KMJBDFA,"I really wanted to see this after the first 'The Trip'. Not quite as good (I watched the first one several times), but still some great moments! Fun to watch - and I loved seeing Italy and learning about the poets they discussed. I would also welcome a third 'Trip'! nb This is the uncut version - the one shown/sold in the USA is edited to a movie length I believe.",1410739200,5,366,4.169014084507042
6433955,2,B00KMJBDFA,"We saw the previews on On Demand. My wife loves Italy so we gave it a try.
On the plus side is nice scenery and food. That's it.
Looking at this from the American point of view, we have two Brit comics,trying to be clever, mugging, growling, yelling and eating and one brief sex scene.  The humor is obtuse, apparently ad libbed, supposedly oh so clever for the sophisticated film goer. Nothing genuinely clever or funny. No plot, none. We left it on because my wife was knitting and I was facebooking and the scenery was nice until we both figured this was a pointless waste of time.
Two stars for travelogue value.",1409875200,5,616,4.451327433628318
6433956,4,B00KMJBDFA,"Did you see ""The Trip"" from 2010? If so, this is the sequel; if not, this is a gab fest between two long-time friends, Steve Coogan (""Philomena"")  and Rob Brydon (Lots of TV), on a road trip from Naples to Capri. We watch them as they eat six meals in six different locations and gab all the way. The scenery is astounding, the food looks scrumptious and the gab is a movie lover's Nirvana.

They talk about (and do impressions of):
  * Diane Keaton and Woody Allen
  * Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando
  * Hugh Grant from the movie Notting Hill
  * Gore Vidal and Al Pacino
  * Anthony Hopkins and Humphrey Bogart
  * All the Batmans plus Michael Caine

They have discussions about:
  * Adolescent girls
  * Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne
  * The movie Roman Holiday
  * Pompeii and those plaster casts of people
  * Kumquats
  * The absurdity of handing the Mini Cooper keys to a young man simply because he had a polo shirt with a hotel logo on it. No ID.
  * Running on a beach with De Niro.

I can't think of a time I have heard our 2014 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience laugh as often as I did in this one. I will be forced to watch for the DVD with captions so I can catch up on all the funny stuff I missed!",1403913600,36,1242,4.183760683760684

6433983,5,B00KMJBDFA,"What a delightful, fun movie!  I enjoyed this more than the prequel ""The Trip.""  While both are ""road trip"" movies,  this one is better.  The scenes on the boat, dining al fresco, with the operatic soundtrack gives me goosebumps (which never happens, believe me).",1467072000,,263,4.909090909090909
6433984,5,B00KMJBDFA,"I adore both The Trip and The Trip to Italy and may even find the latter superior. Melancholic, subtly hilarious, with gorgeous scenery and music, this primarily improvised story continues on with lightly fictionalized versions of Brydon and Coogan a few years after their first culinary trip in the north of England. If you want your traditional set-up/delivery, set-up/delivery comedy this won't be for you. The two discuss family, women, and their own mortality and the incredible, natural delivery yields near-perfect results where a traditional narrative might find these topics a bit heavy-handed. Did I mention the scenery? (I did.)",1462752000,,639,5.4
6433985,5,B00KMJBDFA,"The Trip to Italy is beautifully photographed, culturally interesting (following the route of English poets Byron and Shelley while in residence in Italy), and side-splittingly funny.  Critics have thought that the impressions of Italian-American actors were somewhat over the top; but I thought they were on the money and hysterically funny.  Breathtaking scenery, incredible food and great humor--this is one trip I can take again and wishing that I could vist the places they visitied and eat at the restaurants they ate at.

The films predecessor , The Trip, filmed in England's Lake Dstrict, is the opposite. I guess one has to be British to enjoy endless driving over barren land under grey skies stopping at trendy restaurants serving boring food that has been cooked with a blowtorch.  Hey, that's only my opinion.",1461196800,3,822,5.157894736842105

6433997,5,B00KMJBDFA,"This is a movie I want to watch again and again.  I've seen it probably 10 times.  Between the great comedic acting and gorgeous cinematography, it's just a very nice way to spend a couple of hours.  I also love The Trip too, but I give the slight edge to The Trip to Italy, just because it feels more wistful.  I love the ending of the The Trip to Italy (although I was sorry to see it end).",1458432000,,392,3.9871794871794872

6434001,5,B00KMJBDFA,"Trip to Italy is as the title says a Trip to Italy, about two friends Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon who are given an assignment by the newspaper Observer to journey through the gorgeous Italian landscape, where they are required to eat and review the most delicious food and  the comfortable hotels where they are staying at.
While they are not doing this, they are out doing each other with impressions of famous movie stars, such as Christian Bale, Roger Moore, Tom Hardy and De Niro.
This is a follow up to to the 2010 movie ' The Trip' in which they did the same thing while dining and travelling through England.
Trip Through Italy is a beautiful to look as the Italian countryside takes the lead during the late summer trip.
Even though Coogan and Brydon are enjoying themselves gorging on food, they are melancholic struggling with human foibles such as an affair with a stranger which could lead to more, relationships with teenage sons.
The great food, the chemistry of the two men and the heavenly beauty of Italy in the summer make this is a Trip Worth Taking.

6434002,1,B00KMJBDFA,A movie would have a plot with character development. I gave up after 14 minutes of what seemed to be a series of outtakes from the first movie intercut with kitchen B-roll with an intro sponsored by MINI. Very disappointing after the first one and Philomena. Very over priced at $14 (purchase only). If I saw this in the theater I could get my money back.,1449273600,2,356,4.409090909090909
6434003,2,B00KMJBDFA,"Their discussion of disappointing sequels at the beginning of this film is a fitting prelude to this let-down. I absolutely loved the first movie, but this is a sad attempt to recreate the jokes of its predecessor, this time with glorified marital infidelity, without much success.",1448755200,,281,5.130434782608695

6434005,1,B00KMJBDFA,"All the views as one has of the Italian landscapes and seascapes are 5 stars!  I had such high hopes for this and bought 3 copies, one for myself, and one each for two friends who are accompanying me on a ""Trip to Italy"" in 2016.  I had so expected, and believed, from some of the reviews, that this would be a fun film.  Instead, it is a sadly running riff that seems impromptu at times but failing to hit the high notes like one might have heard in some impromptu remark as Jonathan Winters or Robin Williams could make in a film and just carry it off so well, with such humor.

I viewed the first set of the three, and, after so doing, mailed separately to my friends their copies, with profound apologies over the dialogue and the terrible premise (buy it if you want, and you'll get what it is) of the movie.  That this film's makers had the indecency to harness the beauty of Italy's countryside and its people to this sad movie made it hard to send the movie to my friends, and all I can say is that each of the two of them were revolted by the premise, and only endured the movie to see what might be of Italy's physical beauty for some locales as we might visit in 2016.",1446336000,,1179,4.1535087719298245
6434006,2,B00KMJBDFA,"Beautiful Italian views! Food to die for! But the story if you even want to call that is awful! The nutty babble that goes on between the two main characters is exhausting. Even the actors sitting at the table with them seem sick of it to the point of nauseum.
If you have been to Italy and want to relive the scenerery like I did it's fun to watch. If you are looking for an entertaining film by all means skip this flick!",1443139200,,423,4.108433734939759
6434007,4,B00KMJBDFA,"The two traveling friends are older now with several years between ""The Trip"" and this new opportunity to repeat their travel-writing for The Observer, this time in Italy. Because we (spouse and I) like these characters and find them funny and intellectually fun, we still liked this movie, but not nearly as well as we liked ""The Trip."" They've kind of switched ""roles"" in a way, with Coogan being much more family-oriented and Brydon becoming more alienated from his own wife and child. Their funny, witty banter is still great fun to watch/hear, but there are darker elements in this one.  Because the reviews are related, I'll just post the one for ""The Trip"" here, too, for the relationship between the two movies, this one being a sequel to the first.  Spouse and I watched this one night and then The Trip to Italy the following night.  ""The Trip"" is superior, probably at least in part because the novelty and originality of the two ""characters' "" (Coogan and Brydon) banter and dialogue is delightful but it's subdued, somewhat predictable and darker in ""The Trip to Italy.""  We both loved ""The Trip"" though and laughed out loud often because Coogan and Brydon are hilarious, very talented and so engaging with the movie and literary references. The travel scenery is also wonderful. In the film, Coogan is divorced with children and Brydon is married with a child. Coogan has several ""liaisons"" with women they meet along the way, but there is not explicit sexual material shown. Brydon is a faithful husband who calls home, misses his wife while away from home and is of apparently different ""character"" than Coogan's. In ""The Trip to Italy"", which is far less funny and rather sad at times, it became disappointing and kind of veered into a more sordid theme as Brydon shows a different kind of character than in the first trip when it comes to encounters with women. (Trying not to give away too much story line.)  We're glad we saw them both, have no regrets about buying and watching them, but definitely liked ""The Trip"" much more than ""The Trip to Italy.""",1442707200,,2072,4.7604456824512535

6434009,5,B00KMJBDFA,"I had the misfortune to watch this while a) had a congested chest and b) in between meals. A) because I laughed so hard, I ended up coughing badly and then replaying scenes because my coughing made me miss too much dialogue. B) because the mouthwatering scenes of delectable Italian food had me starving and pining for pasta in no time. I ended up pausing the movie just so I could whip up a plate of spaghetti with roasted grape tomatoes, cracked pepper, sea salt, olive oil, and parmesan cheese and calm my growling stomach.

This sequel surpassed the first movie in its exquisite Italian settings  Rome, Amalfi Coast, Capri  oh, how it made me long to go on an Italian jaunt of my own.

Brydon and Coogan of course brought in what made the first one so successful  their impersonations and banter and bickering and competitiveness. I was delighted that they returned with the Michale Caine impressions, which led to a whole Batman riff that left me gasping for breath (see A, above).

Rather than have s straight repeat of the first, only set in Italy, the film switched expectations. The ""affable"" family man Brydon of the first gets more complex this time around, and Coogan, a rather melancholy star in the first, now gets a happier plot.",1441411200,,1244,4.657534246575342
6434010,2,B00KMJBDFA,"I loved the first movie. Have watched it many times. Although I knew this follow up would probably not be as good, I still thought it would be worth a laugh or two. It was not.
Unlike the first film, this one starts with little explanation, and it truly has no plot. If you have not watched the original ""The Trip"" you will have no clue what is going on. If you have watched the original, you will be disappointed at how weak this effort is.
The jokes were not as funny as in the original,  they did the same impressions, although usually not as well, and their loud talking in some restaurant scenes would have brought management running in real life. There were no outstandingly funny moments as in the first film when they are driving and discussing the way kings urge their men to rest, ""For tomorrow we battle"". ""We attack at 9:30-ish."" Nothing like that in this film.
Unlike in the first film, an affair is improbable, and adds nothing to the movie.
In short, it is a pointless film with no plot, no middle,and no end. It came off as a forced attempt to capitalize on the success of the first, which was a far superior effort. I was expecting pretty good and got nothing.",1438992000,3,1177,4.3744292237442925

One star for very little episodes with beautiful Italian scenery, the rest is like spam - 0 stars. These guys can spoil any country and restaurant by their presence and non stop talk. This movie could be shot in their local pub with the same result, no need to go thru Italy. Don't waste your time, I did and regret.",1437955200,,405,4.486486486486487
6434012,4,B00KMJBDFA,"Very enjoyable all 'round, with beautiful locations to take in as well. I love the personality interplay with these two gents, and the that style of comedy play too. Also love the impersonations. The only disappointment for me was the run time of the production. Not long enough. I preferred the longer run time of the other DVD, The Trip, as that was broken up into separate chapters.

Wife and I are planning my first trip to my ancestral home and we couldn't bear watching it. Found myself FF thru dialogue just to see snippets of scenery and food.

This time they take a six-day trip to Italy, visiting beautiful places and having great dinners, while they chat about many things, doing impressions of Hugh Grant, Tom Hardy and many others.

Obviously the stars are having a good time, playing the fictionalized versions of themselves, but somehow we are left wondering why this film has to be made. Yes, some of what they say or do before the camera are funny, but not good enough to qualify for a feature film. The subplot about Steves estranged son is just boring, and so are the episodes about female characters Emma and Yolanda.

After all, this is prolific director Michael Winterbottom at his worst, who just lets the camera roll and expects something interesting might happen. Despite the inclusion of Steve Coogan, however, this didn't happen.",1434672000,,929,4.836477987421383

This might work for their fans, but it makes for bizarre watching if you've never heard of them. One of them has an exhausting habit of turning every conversation into a showcase for his impressions.  Every. Single. Conversation.

Not sure about the family angle(s), it seems they put family last, hence the trip but then maybe not.

6434042,3,B00KMJBDFA,"The plus is for scenery. Having watched both Trip films, I feel the Trip to Italy was the less heartfelt, less enjoyable of the two. In the first film, having Coogan's character be the flirt and womanizer made more sense, and fit the pair better. In this film, for no explicable reason, Brydon's character takes on the womanizer part. It doesn't fit him as well as it did Coogan, and the fact that he's married makes it seem odd, if not vaguely creepy. Coogan seems to take an almost entirely back-seat role here, so there's less balance between their dialogue. There is also constant opera singing in the background - the glass-breaking female voice type, so hopefully you like that kind of music. It does perhaps fit with the Italian theme, but it is constant. To me, the first film felt like a cozy food tour with genuine friends in an enjoyably English setting. This film feels like watching a pair of tired tourists attempt to revive their travel burnout without succeeding. Still love the pair though.",1426464000,2,1007,4.694915254237288

It picks up after the end of the last movie -- Steve has been living in California, doing his American tv show, and Rob and his wife now have a baby girl, with said wife now preoccupied with childcare and not much time for Rob. Glorious views of Italy of course, and I think more camera focus on the food. There are still a few laugh out loud moments because, hey, it's Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon together! They're each funny and somehow funnier together. Towards the end, Steve's somewhat estranged teenage son joins the trip. Yawn.

I love their Sean Connery riffs, supplemented with ""come, come, Mr Bond"" reprise.  The Italian setting and foodie pretense for their adventure make luscious backdrop.  The troubling concerns for our pair are somewhat reversed this time.  The original road trip to England's Lake District (The Trip) had Steve feeling empty and adrift, while this time Rob stumbles unexpectedly.  The two prove wit, charm and splendid opportunity don't guarantee satisfaction.  Never-the-less, you'll laugh at dialog that has one innocuously commenting upon a passing, attractive, female hotel concierge as having a lovely gait; the other responding it's probably padlocked.

6434056,1,B00KMJBDFA,Scenery so beautiful that it makes me want to go to Italy...but not with Brydon and Coogan. Plot (such as it is ) is that of a road trip movie with the two popular English performs free associating all the way. There are a few laughs but at the ten minute mark I started fast forwarding at a slow speed to enjoy the views until the next act. Both performers are talented but here are more tedious than anything. Was reminded of a Rick Steves travelogue.

They must have dined out 4-5 times.  Scenes would go on far too long of conversations between the men at lunch or dinner.

6434070,4,B00KMJBDFA,"Lots of people like to accuse Adam Sandler of making movies just for the vacation (something I think he has admitted), but what if he got his friends together to make a travelogue-style film in which they visit several restaurants and famous locations while riffing on art, literature and pop culture? Add some British accents and you might end up with something like THE TRIP TO ITALY, which (of course) is much more intelligent than almost anything Sandler has been in. A sequel to 2010's THE TRIP (which, incidentally, I haven't seen yet), Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon return as fictionalized versions of themselves for a trip through the Italian countryside. There is honestly a lot to appreciate here, as long as you're not expecting a formal narrative. First, you have the beautiful natural scenery and on-location shooting. There is also a number of scenes which showcase the finest of Italian cuisine, which foodies should like very much. Although not as focused on the food as something like THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY, I wouldn't recommend watching this film on an empty stomach either. But most importantly, you have two excellent British comedians goofing off with each other for a couple of hours, and the chemistry between them is pretty amazing. The one promotional clip I remember seeing was both of them doing an impression of Michael Caine, and making fun of Christian Bale's and Tom Hardy's voices in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. That actually takes place fairly early on in the film, but the references to other films (a lot of them set or shot in Italy) rarely lets up. There was also lots of references to Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. However, in contrast to the many scenes of witty banter, there are some quieter moments where they are apart from each other and you get a sense of what their characters are like in those kinds of situations, but for me those just weren't as interesting and seemed a little bit like padding. Overall, while the narrative is a bit amorphous, in that it just begins and ends without any clear trajectory other than getting to the six different locations, the film is enjoyable for the journey rather than the destination. You get to spend a couple of hours with two really funny men and get to see a lot of Italy in the process. It's nothing really profound, but sometimes you just need to take a vacation and have a good time.",1422576000,2,2374,4.736714975845411

6434082,3,B00KMJBDFA,"This is a pretty good sequel, as sequels go. I didn't think there would be one since the first one was wrapped up quite nicely. There didn't seem to be a cliffhanger ending or something. I'm guessing they decided to make one since some clips/segments from the first film went viral, and a lot of people who hadn't heard of the movie wanted to watch it after those clips.

In my opinion, it's pretty appropriate that during this movie they poke fun at themselves a little by talking about how second albums and sequels don't usually as well received as the first, and in this case it's true. This movie is not as funny as the first and in some places it's sad and even disappointing. My husband and I LOVED the first movie and we watch it all the time together and we've incorporated bits of it into our lives as inside jokes. We love British comedy and we were so happy when we found there was a sequel.

The first time I watched The Trip to Italy, I was on an airplane which was going through awful turbulence, so I paid $6.00 to watch the movie on the plane in order to distract me. I was pretty sure that any minute the plane was going to fall right out the sky and I'd plummet 35,000 feet to my demise. Even though I was watching it on an itty bitty screen and surrounded by equally frightened people, this movie was engaging enough to distract me. Unfortunately a lot of the swearing was clumsily bleeped out so I was unable to catch a few phrases here and there. I watched it again with my husband when I came back home. We both enjoyed it but we both agree the first was better.

Steve and Rob are a bit older and wiser in the new movie and their destination is Italy (last time it was Northern England). They spend a lot of time in beautiful restaurants and chic hotels by the sea. I have recently gone vegan and this movie gave me the first craving for meat I've had in about a year. Everything looks delicious, but there is much less emphasis on food in this movie than in the last. There's sort of romance thing going on in the plot and a lot of what they talk about in the movie is how crappy it is to get old. There was some of that in the last one, but it was just more fun and joyful. In this one they seem more sad.

They go to some amazing historical locations and they're focusing on Byron and Shelley (it was Coleridge last time) and how they spent their time in Italy. I loved when they visit Pompeii, and later there's a scene when Steve Coogan recites Shakespeare beautifully. Steve and Rob singing Alanis Morrissette is not to be missed. It's definitely not as funny as when they sang Abba, but it's pretty funny. We get to meet Steve's son and we get another visit from Steve's assistant and a return from the same photographer as last time too.

In the previous movie there's a scene when Steve Coogan is dreaming and there's a short appearance of Ben Stiller, in this movie Rob Brydon is dreaming and Fred Armisen is in it. It's a great scene. This movie is very much a role reversal, as last time Steve was down in the dumps and Rob was happy just to be there. This time around it's Rob who is depressed and Steve is much more mellow and at ease with himself.

This is a good movie if you liked The Trip, I honestly think that both movies can stand alone (unlike a lot of movies with sequels) but are more enjoyable together. Much like Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, actually.",1420848000,2,3401,4.248840803709428

There were a few funny moments and one liners, but the interplay seemed forced and yes, self-indulgent.  I couldn't get hooked emotionally.

Yep, the scenery was beautiful and the food looked good, and I wasn't looking for a the traditional beginning/middle/end linear sequence.  I'm okay with the meandering and wandering and discovery of humor and reflection.  I kept waiting for a moment to be hooked and moved a bit emotionally.

Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, are the stars,characters in this film. I had seen their previous film, 'The Trip', where they took a motor trip to the back roads of the UK, stopping at fine Inns, eating wonderful food, drinking good wine, talking about the scenery and their lives. It was a fun rollick with two funny guys. This is pretty much the same, only different.

Coogan from England, Brydon from Wales are actors/comedians, driving through Italy, from Naples to Capri with Amalfi scenery thrown in. The food looks excellent, the restaurants and the Inns are first rate. They drive a Mini Cooper convertible, which is a good thing on these small roads. The scenery is, of course, so superb, a grand taste of the sights and sounds of Italy.  Their conversations amusing, often downright funny, they each have impersonations of their favorite celebrities down to a 'T'. However, I found the impersonations got old for me, difficult to understand at times and annoying at others. It was not until the end of the film that I understood this was a somewhat scripted story, not their real life adventures. Family members and some staff all actors. On the whole, however, I found the film amusing and the scenery gave me everything I had wished for.  Where will they go next year, the wine country of France?

6434119,1,B00KMJBDFA,"Worst film. So disappointing after seeing some positive reviews. The constant silly dialogue between these two baffoons nearly drove me mad. I started speeding the DVD through, after, what I thought was an abysmal start. I kept thinking it had to get better. It did not. The only redeeming features of this film were some beautiful scenery and the odd shot in the kitchens, showing the food. The main part of the film centred around these two guys sitting at dining tables with this constant drivel coming out of their mouths. In the rubbish this DVD goes.

6434122,5,B00KMJBDFA,"The Trip to Italythe sequel to Steve Coogan and Rob Brydons film, The Trip (to northern England) is equally stunning.  Steve and Rob travel across Italy, eating delicious food, dodging Italian drivers, being tempted by Italian women, and trying to match each others impressions of famous British and American actors.

There is more sun here and more pasta, but the production values, the script and the acting are of equal quality.  While the trip to the Lake District, Yorkshire, et al. contained a small theme of tracking S. T. Coleridge (including a trip to Southeys home, Greta Hall), The Trip to Italy finds the co-stars tracking Byron and Shelley.  We see famous sites connected with their lives that are off the tourists normal track.

Hence, The Trip to Italy will appeal not only to foodies and fans of British comic acting; it will also appeal to readers of the Romantic poets.

This is one of the most intelligent, bittersweet, entertaining films I have seen in a great while.",1413504000,15,987,4.845238095238095
6434123,5,B00KMJBDFA,"Im aware that the good majority of you reading this haven't heard of The Trip or its sequel The Trip to Italy, but don't worry, thats okay. The original film was a small British comedy that came out in 2010 to a very limited release and really didn't catch on for American audiences until it showed up on Netflix. If you haven't seen it, you should give it a watch immediately. Its the kind of enjoyable flick youll be recommending to every one of your friends.

Its got a simple plot thats easy to latch on to: two buddies take a trip through the British countryside on a tour of the finest restaurants money can buy. But luckily, they aren't the ones writing the check. Steve Coogan (who you probably know from last years Philomena), our main character, is being paid by The Observer magazine to write food reviews and just so happens to bring along his friend Rob for the ride.

And the sequel is pretty much the same idea, but instead of making the journey through their home country, they're off to Italy. Its full of them making fun of each other, doing hilarious impressions, and eating some of the most delicious foods you can think of (most of which will make you hungry on the spot).

And though it is such a light and entertaining film, it isn't without its more poignant moments. They reflect on their success, friendship, and families, making their characters all the more real.

All I can stress is, watch the first movie before seeing this. Though youll still most likely enjoy it
without doing so, it will make the experience much sweeter.",1412467200,2,1555,4.542857142857143

6434125,5,B00KMJBDFA,"A review of the film itself, not the DVD:

A wonderful follow-up to 2010's ""The Trip.""  I agree with one professional reviewer who said the is is ""The Godfather 2"" of road trip movies (and this makes a lot more sense after you watch the film).  I absolutely enjoyed this movie as much as the first.  Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon do a superb job portraying fictionalized versions of themselves as they travel through Italy, gabbing and eating as they go, and dealing with their individual mid-life crises as well.  I did not stop laughing once while watching this in the theatre.  The humor is sometimes subtle, and not as in-your-face as many American audiences expect their comedies, but it is there in droves.  I think the greatest compliment I can give both ""The Trip"" and ""The Trip to Italy"" is that the films made me want to be there, traveling with these two old friends.  My next mission in life will be to track down the two TV mini-series that were edited down to make these films, and spend even more time traveling, albeit vicariously.

One warning: do not see either film on an empty stomach.  The scenes of the tantalizing, sumptuous meals these men eat at regular intervals had my appetite kick into overdrive, and I had to race to the nearest 5 star restaurant as soon as I left the theatre.",1411776000,19,1305,4.538461538461538

8660109,2,B00KMJBDFA,"Two British television stars take a drive through Italy for a magazine article, and one of them gets the chance to have a major role in an American movie about the mob. Presumably this is all fiction, because it did originally seem to be a straight travelogue...until you hear how weird the initial conversation gets. You see fancy meals being prepared and eaten, the pair going to posh hotels, pictures of beautiful scenery, many references to Byron, Shelley, and other writers of that era...and then you realize the locations of the hotels and restaurants in the movie are never identified.

There is no real plot to the movie, which has a lot of chatter between the two leads, as well as their (fictional?) families. And much of that involves impersonations of various British actors. Mildly entertaining, but the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.",1503964800,,864,4.837837837837838

8660112,5,B00KMJBDFA,"Okay, if you're into your stereotypical simple American sitcoms with laughter tracks, this show isn't for you. If you don't know many British references, this is also not for you. This show is also not just a travel show, so it's not just views of Italy constantly. This is two guys playing fictionalised versions of themselves that go round the beautiful country of Italy while having to write food reviews for a national paper. They are both well known in the UK, Steve Coogan is more known for Alan Partridge, which is also a unique UK sitcom, while Rob Brydon is a well known comedian known for Gavin and Stacey, which starred James Corden, whilst presenting panel shows. What I find baffling is the narrow mindedness of the bad reviews, it's either boring or not funny. Why is that? Is it because you 'just don't get it' because it's not full of simple jokes or one liners. So who does this appeal to?
