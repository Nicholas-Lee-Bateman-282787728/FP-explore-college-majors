1805254,5,B00007AP31,"Red Dwarf is a classic BBC Sci-Fi series with a cult following all over the world.  Originally produced an a miniscule budget and a fairly unknown cast, it grew to become one of the BBC's most popular shows and now was a movie in pre-production for a 2004 release.
The DVD contains 2 disks with the following episodes from the first series:
""The End"".  We are introduced to David Lister and his superior Arnold Rimmer, two junior technicians on the mining space ship ""Red Dwarf"".  They work together, the live in a cabin together... and they HATE each other.  After visiting Titan, Lister smuggles a cat onboard but is caught and sentenced by Captain Holister to spend the rest of the tour in a stasis pod.  When Lister emerges he discovers to his horror that 3 million years have passed.  While in stasis, a drive plate ruptured and the radiation leak killed the entire crew.  Holly, the ship's computer, piloted the ship into deep space and didn't release Lister until the background radiation level became safe.  In an unusual attempt to preserve Lister's sanity as the last human alive, Holly resurrects Rimmer as a hologram to keep him company.  As the two of them argue with each other they are surprised to encounter a humanoid life form that evolved from Lister's pregnant cat which had survived the radiation by sheltering in the ship's cargo hold...
In this episode we're introduced to the two main characters and their hate-hate relationship is defined.  This is also the only chance until the last series that we get to see the fully populated Red Dwarf with the exception of a few ""flash-back"" sequences in later episodes.
""Future Echos"".  Over the last 3 million years, Red Dwarf has been constantly accelerating and suddenly breaks the light barrier!  Lister, Rimmer and the Cat begin see images of themselves in the future projected throughout this ship.  Finally, Lister and Rimmer see an image of Lister aged 171 who has an urgent message for him...
An interesting script where the crew end up interacting with future versions of themselves.  Of particular note is the sequence where Lister is totally confused by the behaviour or Rimmer only to discover he had been talking to a future version that couldn't see him.
""Balance of Power"".  Lister is lonely and asks Rimmer if he can temporarily replace his hologram with Kochanski (a female member of the crew he had lusted over).  Rimmer refuses, as he doesn't believe that Lister will switch him back on after his ""date"".  Lister then forms a plan to complete the Chef's exam so he can outrank Rimmer and order him to hand over her disc.  Fearing that Lister just might manage to pass, Rimmer has to find ways to distract his subordinate...
The mistrust and dislike for each other held by the two main characters is greatly expanded on in this episode.  At this point, Kochanski is supposed to be someone Lister fancies, but could never sum up the courage to ask out on a date.  Later on in the series, the writers decide to throw continuity out of the window and re-write them as lovers who broke up.
""Waiting for God"".  Lister decides learn to read (smell) the books of the Cat-People and discovers that they died fighting over a religion based on the belief of ""Cloister the Stupid"" who saved their virgin Holy Mother by allowing himself to be frozen in time.  Lister realises that he is their ""god"", however, the Cat is not impressed and wants a second opinion.  Deep in the cargo decks, Lister discovers a dieing Cat-Priest who has lost his faith...
A humours satire of religion in general and our only glimpse of another Cat-Person throughout the whole story arc.  It's also the only decent story the Cat gets in the first series.
""Confidence and Paranoia"".  Lister catches a 3 million year old mutated flu virus and becomes ill.  Unfortunately, this new virus causes his fevered dreams to become solid resulting in it raining fish in the cabin, the Mayor of Warsaw combusting and two strange humans appearing on the flight deck.  Rimmer recognises them as symptoms of Lister's disease, but Lister falls for the charm of ""Confidence"" and refuses to get rid of them.  When ""Confidence"" murders ""Paranoia"" and then tries to convince Lister to remove his helmet in space, Lister realises he's trapped with a madman...
This episode is a fan-favourite, mainly due to the excellent gags and the over-the-top performance of Lister's ""Confidence"".  Lister also gets to demonstrate his prowess with a guitar as he gives us a sterling performance of the ""Indling Song"".
""Me2"".  Lister thought he'd found Kochanski's data disc, but is horrified to find that it's a copy of Rimmer's and now there are two of them running around and putting him down.  Eventually, the two Rimmers turn on each other and Lister decides to turn one off - for good...
Red Dwarf might be made on a small budget, but the split screen effects of having two Rimmers running around at the same time was perfect.  We aslo get to look deeply into Rimmer's troubled past and discover just how he became so petty and annoying...
Extra features on the discs include cast comentries,writer & director commentries, deleted scenes, out-takes, trailers, documentry, music scores, photographs and more.
Note:  The US Region 1 version is missing the ""Drunk"" featurette from the Region 2 and 4 versions.  This was due to the music used in the featurette not being cleared for distribution in the USA in time for release.",1053734400,32,5445,4.794432548179872
1805255,5,B00007AP31,"Don't listen to that detractor John Tilelli- He's just a pediatric cardiologist from Bumblehump Florida. I checked out his reviews. His idea of good Sci-fi is aparrantly limited to Men In Black II. I'm not surprised this was a little over his head. It's true that the classic RD foursome (Rimmer,Lister, Cat, Kryton) wouldn't coagulate until after this season, however, these episodes are hilarious and the actors are playing around- experimenting with the new format of television sci-fi comedy. Like all great English episodics, this series didn't need to rely on special effects, or stars, or gratuitous sex and violence. Not that I mind those things, but the English have had a television focus on story and characterization- and those two elements are very present in Red Dwarf. If I could get an uptown Bergdorf's fashion maven into this show almost as much as she liked Absolutely Fabulous, you and your friends will get hours of fun out of this set. Crack open a couple of cold ones, break out the store of marijuana gin, and watch these petty, inconsiderate, slobs go at each other- you'll see shades of you and your friends in them...",1051056000,34,1144,4.871794871794871
1805256,4,B00007AP31,"Red Dwarf is one of those ever changing series. You can't judge the complete series on the first two seasons. The first season is a fairly basic sitcom. Most of the budget was spent on the main ship, Red Dwarf so they couldn't even afford to take the crew off the ship. There were also some problems in getting the sets to look the way the creators wanted it. The set has too much grey in it. If you look at the exteriors of the ship, there is a tea bag hanging on the bottom of the ship.
Due to a method of punishment used on the ship (suspended animation without pay), Dave Lister ends up being the last human alive. The computer, Holly, is supposedly intelligent and provides some conversation for Lister. The ship's computer also maintains a hologram of one of the crew - Rimmer. Rimmer is a total smeghead. Also, Lister's pet cat, Frankenstein had kittens, and the cats eventually evolve into humanoid creatures while still having some basic cat traits.
If you don't like this first season, give season 3 a shot. Only the first two seasons are fairly simple. The changes made in third season stay in place for the rest of the series, but the stories continue to develope and change.
So far, this series has the best commentary I have ever heard - if you stick with the actors. They actually joke around and comment on the scenes. The bonus commentary with the show's writers and director during the first episode is kinda dull, and, if you watch the other extras, you don't learn much new information. The bonus commentary is only available from the episode selection menu, not the main one.
The commentaries are also very unprofessional. During the writers and director's discussion, you can hear what sounds like a new mail sound from a PC. And during the actors commentary on Confidence and Paranoia, a cell phone rings. It's at the very end of the episode.
The DVD has several extras on a second disc - deleted scenes, smeg-ups (bloopers), isolated music, photos. This is an ideal DVD set for true fans.
Trivia:
Danny John-Jules (The Cat) also appears in Blade II and has appeared on stage in Starlight Express.
Chris Barrie (Rimmer) can be seen in Black Adder III ""Nob and Nobility"" where he plays the part of a French revolutionary.",1050710400,12,2243,4.596009975062344
1805257,5,B00007AP31,"For years I've been sporadically watching episodes of the ridiculous, yet side-splittingly funny, Sci-Fi Britcom, ""Red Dwarf"" on my local PBS station. Now the BBC have finally released too DVD the show that answers the question, ""What would it be like if they allowed total idiots in space?"" The show's premise takes place on board the mining ship, Red Dwarf. It is three million years in the future. Through various acts of ineptitude, crewman, Dave Lister is the last (and slobbiest) human left in the universe. But he is not alone. He is kept company by Holly, the ship's brilliant yet moronic computer. Also on board is the holographic image of deceased crewman, Arnold J. Rimmer. When alive, Rimmer was the most annoying idiot in the universe (think of a cross between Felix Unger and Frank Burns). Now dead he seems to want to continue on in that position. To round out the ship's inhabitants is a half human/half feline creature called simply 'the Cat'.Apparently he is the product of millions of years of cat evolution and has a prediliction for zoot suits, eating ""little fishies"" and spraying areas of the ship he claims ownership of. Together these four characters go on various adventures in stupidity, that make up one of the funniest shows to come out of British Television. The show is well written and the actors (Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules & Norman Lovett) are wonderful. The DVD, ""Red Dwarf Series-I"" has the first season (six episodes) which presents the origins and first adventures of the show. These early episodes are crude in appearence and special effects, but that dosn't get in the way of the laughs. The only thing missing is the hilarious, character of Kryton the Robot, who would join the cast in future seasons. The DVD itself is excellent featuring sophisticated, animated menus and tons of extras including a ""Red Dwarf"" documentry, episode commentaries (featuring the show's creators and actors), deleted scenes,etc. This DVD is ""Red Dwarf"" heaven. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi or British comedies or both, than I would highly recommend the ""Red Dwarf"" DVD series.",1048636800,5,2115,4.943820224719101
1805258,1,B00007AP31,"I suppose that the idea of combining science fiction and comedy in a television series is appealing. It would attract a crossover audience and maybe provide some interesting unique dilemmas. Unfortunately this series is so badly written tnat the experiment fails miserably.
The setting is as follows: The crew of the mining ship Red Dwarf was killed in a radiation accident. The only survivors are a crewman (Lister),  his reincarnated cat (appearing as  a Little Richard alter ego), and the holograms of the rest of the crew. They have been lost in space for a billion years and so are we. The episodes start with the ship's computer orienting us to the story - here's a sample: ""In our last episode, Lister failed the chef's exam even though he said that he passed. That's about as exciting as it gets around here."" The computer speaks the truth. I to exercise a lot of patience to get to anything that is funny or remotely interesting. The sets are terrible. The camera work suits an Austrian  operetta. The reserved British laugh track doesn't help us get in the mood. The 'cat' doesn't help the plot move along and is simply annoying. Save your money and wait for something better to come along. BBC television did some great comedies. This, sadly, is not one of them.",1046908800,5,1273,4.699551569506727
1805259,5,B00007AP31,"This DvD is one of the best i have ever seen. easy to understand Menus, Easter Eggs, commentarys, this one the beginning of the Red Dwarf Saga and doesnt miss a beat. Rimmer is in top form, Lister is God, Cat is a nazzy cat, and Holly is....well, hes Holly! This proves that the Red Dwarf production team can do no wrong!",1046649600,2,321,4.193548387096774
1805260,5,B00007AP31,"For a long time, the only copies of Red Dwarf shown on TV or sold in stores were re-editied versions with the more off-colour jokes cut out and CGI special effects shots taking up the extra time.  I cannot tell you how glad I am to see the ORIGINAL VERSION back.  I had thought the Red Dwarf I remember from college to be gone forever.  I am glad the BBC has seen the light and given the fans what we want: the classic comedy series as originally shown.
Series One is probably the weakest season they did.  The show got better as it went on.  But I would still reccomend these first 6 episodes to anyone who loves the show and to anyone who has yet to get a chance to see it.  I already have got the show one new fan by showing these DVDs and will probably have more soon.  Red Dwarf Rocks.",1046476800,6,790,4.058064516129032

1805315,5,B00007AP31,"One of the all time classics of comedy AND science fiction. Red Dwarf is a story of the last human being alive, Dave Lister, 3 million years out into deep space with an android, a hologram and a feline humanoid as companions. That is where Red Dwarf departs from other sci-fi vehicles. Lister is a curry eating, beer swilling slob, but with a softer side. Rimmer, the Hologram, is his ""living"" nightmare, but also keeps Lister sane. Kryten, the android is a neurotic toilet attendant, turned science officer, and Cat, the Feline is just that,the humanoid descendant of the Cat that Lister smuggled on board 3 million years in the past. Over the decades, the audience for this quirky show has grown in legions, and the cast has become their gods. There is a reason for this, you can tell as you watch the episode that the cast thoroughly enjoyed every second of putting on this wonderfully bizarre show. If you love sci-fi, watch this immediately. If you love off-beat comedy, go back in time and catch this show in the past.",1435968000,3,1024,4.631868131868132

The Ship's computer, seen as a speaking head on a video screen is also hilarious.

1805498,5,B00007AP31,"Red Dwarf is a delightfully strange science fiction comedy show based on the book with the same name.  Dave Lister, marvelously played by Craig Charles, enlists in service to a deep space mining vehicle called Red Dwarf.  He's not the most ambitious person on board but then again, most of the personnel aren't.  His biggest ambition is to move to Fiji and have a farm.  He is bunked in with an anal retentive personality by the name of Arnold Rimmer.  Rimmer is a stickler for mundane details and is the thorn in Lister's side.  They are food replicator technicians.  Rimmer and Lister are soooo not compatible.  Lister realizes he has made a huge mistake in enlisting and hatches a plan that will land him in a stasis unit hopefully until his enlistment time is up.  Animals are unauthorized on board the Red Dwarf.  When Lister gets shore leave, he buys a cat that he calls Frankenstein (even though the cat is female).  He makes sure Frankenstein has all her shots and doesn't carry any diseases. Lister brings the cat on board and hides her out making sure to feed her and otherwise take care of her.  He takes a picture of himself with the cat and has it processed in Red Dwarf's photo lab.  Naturally the Captain hears about it and confronts Lister with it.  When Lister won't tell the Captain where he's hidden the cat, he gets sentenced to 18 months in stasis.  This is what he wants however, when he gets revived, its 3 million years later and he's the only living person on board.  Due to a poorly installed piece of equipment by Rimmer, a radiation leak kills the entire crew.  When Holly revives Lister 3 million years later, Lister can't comprehend the fact that he is the only one left alive.  Holly (the ship's computer) has created a hologram of Rimmer as company for Lister.  Rimmer has not improved in personality in death.  He's more annoying to Lister than ever especially now he's dead.  What happened with Frankenstein after all this time?  Well,Frankenstein flourished.  Lister didn't realize that Frankenstein was pregnant when he bought her.  She had litters over all those years and, they evolved.  The offspring of Frankenstein turned into a mostly human entity with some cat characteristics played expertly by Danny John-Jules.  I adored this show however, this is a show that is not easy to figure out what is going on if you do not watch it in order.  You will miss the nuances and not understand the vernacular.  Smeg and smeg head were prevalent throughout the series.  Obviously smeg was used the way we use damn or hell or the f word.  Smeg head was a derogatory term meaning stupid (as far as I could tell).

1805543,5,B00007AP31,"I'll be completely honest (so what else is new?) - I was not a Red Dwarf fan, when it first was aired on my local PBS network. Granted,  I was really young and just thought the humor was crude. I had to grow into liking it, if that makes sense. Now, I find it hilarious! What's more, I am really happy it was released on DVD. We meet Dave Lister, the last man alive on Earth (Craig Charles), a loveably scruffy and dreadlocked dude, who was safely sealed away, along with his pregnant Cat during a fatal explosion aboard his space ship, the Red Dwarf. The descendant of his Cat is a decked out, suit wearing egomaniac with a penchant for dance steps (care of James Brown, Michael Jackson and a dash of Prince), and a passion for marking his territory with tiny perfume bottle in hand, and vanity that far surpasses the size of the ship (Danny John-Jules). They also are joined by Arnold Judas Rimmer (Craig Barrie), a Hard Light Hologram, who was Lister's compatriot aboard the ship, during his living days.

They bicker, reflect on life's absurdity and hilariously meander through these half-a-dozen episodes. Plus, deep, life lessons are actually examined - one of my favorites is that of Ego and Paranoia, when Lister hallucinates and these sides of his consciousness are literally embodied in the likenesses of two men who appear aboard the ship. In addition to the episodes, we are treated to outtakes, a Japanese version of the pilot episode, and much more.

1805556,3,B00007AP31,"The mining ship Red Dwarf, five miles long and three miles wide, is making its way through the outer Solar system on a mission to process and refine ore. It's not a particularly compelling job, but Third Technician Dave Lister entertains himself by slobbing out, partying with his friends in the rec rooms and making life a misery for his boss and room-mate, the wound-up, arrogant, ambitious and spectacularly incompetent Arnold J. Rimmer. Lister's fortunes take a turn for the worse when the captain learns he has sneaked a pregnant cat on board in violation of quarantine (cunningly discovered when Lister sent a picture of himself and the cat to be developed in the ship's lab). Unwilling to let his cat be killed and dissected, Lister agrees to forfeit 18 months pay and spend the rest of the trip in stasis.

Of course, when Lister wakes up he discovers some complications ensued whilst he was in temporal stasis. A lethal radiation leak wiped out the crew and the ship's computer, Holly, set course for deep space to avoid exposing anyone else to radiation poisoning. However, he had to wait for the radiation to die down to a safe background level before he could release Lister. Unfortunately, this has taken three million years. As Red Dwarf starts its long journey home, Lister discovers that the only other lifeforms on board are a holographic recreation of Rimmer, created by Holly to 'keep him sane', and a humanoid lifeform who descended and evolved from Lister's cat.

Red Dwarf bears the honour of being the greatest SF sitcom ever made. True, this isn't exactly a difficult achievement (apart from Futurama nothing else is really even on the same radar as Red Dwarf), but nonetheless it is a notable one. It is also fair to say that the show took a good year or so to get into its stride, and watching this first season again twenty-one years on is a bit of a mixed bag. On one level most of the ingredients of its later greatness are there and there are some excellent ideas and gags, but on another the show is hamstrung by insanely low production values and a lack of experience on the part of its main cast, resulting in a series that is quite variable in quality.

The first episode, cunningly entitled The End, sets up the basic premise and does so quite well, running through the set-up in half an hour and establishing a long-term goal for the crew (a goal which seems to be increasingly forgotten as the show continues). There's some good laughs, but the low-budget sets (grey, grey and more grey) mean that it feels very cheap although, at great odds with contemporary British SF series like Doctor Who, the actual model shots of the ship itself are excellent and remain impressive. The cast is a mixed bag, consisting of a dancer (Danny John-Jules as the Cat), a stand-up poet (Craig Charles as Lister), an impressionist and voice-over artist (Chris Barrie as Rimmer) and a stand-up comedian (Norman Lovett as the ship's computer, Holly). They all bring great enthusiasm to their roles but their lack of experience come through in some scenes, particularly with Craig Charles who tends to shout most of his lines as if he's still doing a punk-poetry recital in a noisy Liverpool bar. As the season progresses, however, the cast seems to learn that less is more and they relax into their roles.

The second episode, Future Echoes, sets up the future format of Red Dwarf quite successfully. A hard or at least semi-serious SF idea is introduced, in this case breaching the light barrier, and comic ideas are spun off from this concept. More groundwork is laid for the future as Lister gets some glimpses of how his life will turn out (some ideas of which are eventually explored and resolved in future seasons) and Chris Barrie deserves a round of applause for a scene where he has to perform the exact same scene twice with no effects trickery at all. A clever idea, well-explored. Balance of Power sees Lister and Rimmer's struggle for supremacy and rank reaching a new level when Lister decides to take the chef's exam so he outranks Rimmer and is an amusing episode. Waiting for God explores the history of the Cat race and Lister's position in their religion, but it's more vaguely amusing and a bit silly than genuinely funny or clever. Rimmer's speech about the Quagaars (an alien race he hopes who will appear and give him a proper body) is the episode's highlight. The premise of Confidence and Paranoia is completely daft - Lister contracts mutated pneumonia which makes gives his hallucinations solid form - but played amusingly. The season finale, Me 2, sees Rimmer joined by another hologram and the ensuing struggle for dominance is quite entertaining.

Overall these are entertaining episodes, but there's clearly a lot of work to be done. The Cat in particular comes across as quite distant and even cold in these early episodes, not caring if Lister dies in one scene and cracking jokes during another tragic moment. It's true to the idea behind the character, perhaps (cats don't really care about people, only where their next meal is coming from), but it makes him hard to like. Many of Rimmer's character traits are set up in this season but until the finale he mostly comes across as pathetic rather than sympathetic or with pathos, which the later seasons manage more successfully.

Still, all the ingredients for the series' later greatness are here in full, and watched in the knowledge of how fantastic this series gets later, Season I (Red Dwarf's seasons are numbered in Roman numerals for reasons never adequately explained) becomes more interesting in retrospect. First-time viewers may find themselves wondering what all the fuss is about, but I recommend them to stick with it as it does improve immensely in the second season.

The extras on the DVD set are quite impressive. All six episodes have full cast commentaries, whilst there is a detailed documentary exploring how the series was created, written and produced and the immense problems Rob Grant and Doug Naylor had getting it on air. The extras are genuinely impressive and well worth a look.

I was so disappointed! One of the reasons I had wanted to see this was because it had been depicted often as a great Sci-fi series. It most certainly is not. It is a low-budget comedy with a Sci-fi background. But the nuts and bolts of the show are comic. The Sci-fi elements are purely props.

Even more disappointing was the extraordinarily low budget aspect of the whole show. There are only three or four extremely cheap sets upon which all of the show takes places, giving the show a static, immobile feel.

What we are left with is a mildly funny series. I've long been a fan of British humor, but I don't find this to be on the level of MONTY PYTHON, FAWLTY TOWERS, THE OFFICE, or THE FALL AND RISE OF REGINALD PERRIN. The extremely small cast is likable (and also oppressingly male -- I hope to god that a few women are added to the cast in subsequent seasons) and the writing solid if not outstanding.

My hope is that the show gets better as it goes along. it is possible that the passionate reviews here represent the reviewers feelings about the show as a whole and not just the first one. Hopefully the cast will expand and we will not be restricted to only a few males. And hopefully it will not be so extremely low budget. Those who have seen the show will know whether or not this is true. But as a reviewer I have to review not subsequent seasons, but Season One alone.

Apparently, the writers wanted experienced actors for the series.  After many auditions, what they ended up with was a poet (Craig Charles), an impressionist (Chris Barrie), a dancer (Danny John-Jules) and a stand up comic (Norman Lovett), who had little, if any, experience in acting.

It may look dated and drab set wise, but the humour is genious and still has me howling with laughter today.  There are some classic scenes in this series.

All except for slobby space-bum Dave Lister who survived the ordeal because he was put into stasis for bringing an unquarantined animal onboard. The animal was Frankenstein, his pet cat, who manages to survive the radiation by escaping to the ships bowels. Frankenstein did pretty well for herself (yes Franky's a she) having her babies and spawning an entire race of ""Cat-people"" over the course of 3 million years, which is the amount of time it took for the radiation levels to lower to a safe enough point that humans (and cat-people) could survive. As Lister emerges from a 3 million year stasis sleep, he finds that the crew are dead, his library books are way, WAY overdue and his only companions are; Holly, the ships senile computer who claims to have an IQ of 6000, a creature (one of the cat-people) known only as Cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunk-mate. This series is the first of 8. The sets and special effects of this series are far removed from later series, but the gray backgrounds and drab wardrobes (except for Cat) don't hamper the stories in any way. Some people prefer later series because of the visual differences, but I enjoy the personal interaction between the characters in this series, compared to the spiffy special effects or action sequences in later series. It seemed to me that they ran out of jokes in the later series and replaced comedy with more sci-fi and action to fill time. I'm not saying later series aren't any good, but what I am saying is that you don't have the one on one thrust and parry of comedic timing and ""hold-your-belly"" laughs that you get with the first 4 series.

1805567,5,B00007AP31,"I remember watching these shows as a young boy on telly during the summers of '89 and '90 when I was off from school and staying in Barnbury park nearby Islington. Of all the shows I can vividly recall loving this 1st season of Red Dwarf. More so than the later seasons.

With it's minimalist cast, low budget and simple plot idea the 1st season shows not only got me into Sci-Fi futher but shaped my overall sense of humor and sarcasm. Nothing I've seen in America comes close to Red Dwarf.

POSITIVES: One of the most original starts of any show I can think of. All the episodes in season 1, whiles not as funny as later seasons are tightly produced and every aspect of the plot is well thought out and the dialogues are very clever and brillantly acted out. If anything, Red Dwarf during the early seasons remined me alot of Black Adder in that the episodes were shot in mainly one or two rooms the whole time and consisted mainly of very clever and funny ""stage-like"" dialogue between 2 characters trying to deal with each other and their problematic environment.

NO NEGATIVES WITH ME BUT: These are not the average commercial, mainstream fast food TV shows that are easily eaten and quickly forgotten. There is a lot of intellegent charm, wit and well constructed science fiction plot situtions here that will entertain everyone. This is a season that is rewatchable (more so than later seasons) and will not catch dust in any collection. And it needs to be re-watched to really be appreciated.

However some aspects of the jokes will not be understood by everyone who is not familiar with British culture or know what a curry vindaloo is...

1805568,5,B00007AP31,"When I was eleven or so, there was this kid in my class who used to swear an awful lot. You name it, he said it. I soon figured out what most of these words meant, though there was one I could never figure out. ""Smeg."" It was a word he used just as strongly as all the others. He occasionally mentioned a show called ""Red Dwarf"" which was on late here in Australia, but I didn't connect the two together. I'd eventually find out that ""smeg"" was a fictional swear word used in the series, though what it means isn't exactly clear. After being urged to see it several times by various people, I eventually saw the seventh series some years later, then the ""remastered"" editions of series' one, two and three, which were broadcast once a week for eighteen weeks. Then I saw series eight, which wasn't nearly as good as the others. Anyway, enough of my rambling...

Red Dwarf is a science fiction comedy. Like ""2001: A Space Odyssey it's about a man called Dave (in this case the dreadlocked Dave Lister rather than the clean cut Dave Bowman) and his computer (called Holly rather than Hal in this case). Like ""The Odd Couple"", a tidy man lives with a messy man, in this case the beer swilling Dave is the sloppy one and his tidy roomate is an uptight fellow called Arnold Rimmer, a selfish man who tries too hard with everything he does.  Like James Brown, a tall, dark and handsome cat-like being shimmies down the corridors of the spaceship to his own funky theme. Like a good science fiction, it has reasonably good continuity and mythology and like a good comedy, it will make you laugh, and it's very, very quotable.

There are six episodes in this series.

The first called ""The End"" sees Lister (Craig Charles) and Rimmer (Chris Barrie from ""The Brittas Empire"" and ""Tomb Raider1 & 2"") employed on the mining ship Red Dwarf as technicians, virtually the lowest rank on board the ship, where they bicker and bait each other. After a smuggling a cat on board, Lister is sent to statis, where he is frozen in time until the Red Dwarf returns to Earth, which only should be a few months away. Instead, Dave wakes up three million years later, the sole survivor of a radiation leak that killed everyone on board: the captain, all of Lister's mates, and the girl he worshipped from afar Christine Kochanski. However, the cat that Lister had smuggled had escaped the radiation leak and evolved into a race of cat people, one of which (Danny John-Jules) is roaming the ship in a trendy suit. There is also is a hologram facility on board that can resurrect one crew member, so Dave won't feel so lonely. Who did Holly the computer resurrect? Dave's bickering ""buddy"" Arnold Rimmer.

""Future Echoes"" sees the Red Dwarf returning towards Earth, as Lister wants to move to Fiji. Passing the speed of light distorts time, causing bits of the future (both near and far ahead in time) to be seen.

There's tension between Lister and Rimmer in ""Balance of Power"". Rimmer outranks Lister, even if only by a whisker, and Lister is sick of it. Will Lister pass the chef's exam and become his own boss? Meanwhile, the Cat discovers fish from the vending machine (one of my favourite moments in the series).

In ""Waiting For God"" we discover more about the race of beings that evolved from Listers cat. It seems that they formed a religion, with Lister as their savior and Fiji as their divine kingdom. Can Lister handle the Cat priest's expectations? Meanwhile, Rimmer discovers a pod he is certain came from extraterrestrials.

Lister gets sick in ""Confidence and Paranoia"" and his feverish hallucinations come to life. One of these hallucinations is a personification of his confidence and optimism, and the other a personification of his paranoia and anxiety. Hmm...

Finally, in ""Me Squared"", the Red Dwarf crew discovers they can have another crew member resurrected as a hologram. This could be Lister's chance. He could resurrect the love of his life, Christine Kochanski. Rimmer, however, gets greedy and resurrects himself again, so that there are two of him. This irritates everyone, including the original Rimmer eventually.

There's lots of special features, though there are even more if you work your way through the series DVDs. There's commentaries, not only from the cast, but from the writers on the first episode. There's a whole load of deleted scenes (my favourite is when the Cat does his laundry by licking all his clothes with his tongue) plus outtakes, a documentary about how the series got off the ground, a photo gallery, special effects footage, music files, sound bites from the audio books of the novelizations of the show read by Chris Barrie. There's even an original trailer and a montage of all the times the characters get drunk. Oh dear...

1805569,3,B00007AP31,"""What's smeg?"" a small girl asked once at an interview with the cast.  They all immediately crawled under their seats.

Red Dwarf is the definitive, low-budget sci-fi series.  Its not an adventure like Star Trek, its a comedy which makes pretty much puts it in its own genre.  ""Firefly"" is the only thing I've seen that even comes close in the U.S. and that only lasted 4/5ths of a season.

No one reading this review needs a summary of the plot for RD, everyone else has posted that, so I'll just say that although this series is NOT FOR EVERYONE, I love it.  Red Dwarf paved the way in the same fashion as Sharpe created a market for historical action-adventures.  Red Dwarf is probably one of the most popular cult shows in the UK and we can't wait for the movie that just doesn't seem to be coming (partly because Craig Charles has trouble keeping out of jail).

The ""special effects"" on this series are certainly ""special"" but in themselves lend to the comedy of the show.  There is very little actual acting from Craig or Chris as they seem to play themselves...  or perhaps these are just the roles that defined them as actors?

Red Dwarf is a piece of history that can not be ignored.  It has made fun of Star Trek, made Patrick Stewart laugh, and then been copied for ST:VOY and probably other Sci-Fi shows.  The humour is British but if you have any sort of intelligence, you'll get it.",1146182400,7,1396,4.448818897637795

This is the first series of the sci-fi comedy which introduces us to space bum Dave Lister (Craig Charles) who is put in to suspended animation for three million years only to come out of it as the only serviving crew member abord the mining ship Red Dwarf. He's not alone however, he's joined by a hologram of his dead bunk mate Arnold j Rimmer (Chris Barrie) and a life form evolved from his cat (Danny John Jules) and daft computer Holly (Norman Lovett). The first series isn't quite as good as some of the later stuff but there are still some great comedy moments here. As i said before the extras here are excelent, you get everything from deleted scenes to the japanese version of the pilot episode.

1805571,5,B00007AP31,"I've been a fan of this British comedy series for a number of years, and I still love it!

It stars a dimwit adorable un-heroic Dave Leister or `Leister' as he's known to everyone. He's the last human alive in the universe, stuck on a spaceship with Arnold Rimmer (the holographic AI of his dead bunk mate), Cat (a man who evolved from 3 million years of cat history), Kryten (a confused droid trying to break his programming) and Holly (a computer with an IQ of 3000 ~ that's 6000 PE teachers).

Leister was sentenced to stasis (frozen in time) to be docked from his pay on the mining ship Red Dwarf after being found to have an illegal animal onboard ~ his pet cat Frankenstein. During his time in stasis, Rimmer mistakenly repaired the drive plate properly and a radio active expolsion killed the crew. 3 million years later when it was safe to emerge, Leister was brought out of stasis and is the remaining survivor.

Throughout his quest to return back to `Earth' (if it still exists!) he meets the descendant of his cat Frankenstein ~ Cat, the strange computer left on his own for 3 million years ~ Holly, the hologram form of Rimmer and 2 service robots known as Scutters. (Kryten is introduced in Series 2)

The extras are fantastic in this DVD and worth paying that little bit extra! Not only does it contain Smeg Ups (everyones faves!) but it also contains music clips and interviews. This DVD contains the entire 1st season and is not to be missed by anyone!",1139184000,2,1469,4.511278195488722
1805572,5,B00007AP31,"This is the first, and, in my opinion, the best Red Dwarf series. I remember watching this when it first aired on BBC2. I hadn't intended to watch it, it just happened to be on and I remember thinking it would be rubbish. Shows how wrong I was.
Ignore the low budget sets and old fashioned `special' effects and ignore the fact that the cast comprises unknown (at that time) actors. None of that matters with such a wickedly funny script played in a wonderfully over the top manner by its stars.
The Red Dwarf is a mining ship millions of miles from home. Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is about the lowest ranked member of crew possible, senior only to the tiny robotic Scutters. Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) is only one step above him but is highly ambitious and opinionated (as well as totally deluded about his abilities), and just loves to pull rank over Dave. The two despise each other and swap insults with unfailing regularity. When Dave is found to have smuggled a cat on board he is threatened with stasis for the remainder of the journey if he doesn't hand the creature over for extermination. Dave opts for stasis and this is where the saga of Red dwarf really starts. When he comes out of stasis he finds that something has wiped out the entire crew of the ship and he has been in stasis for 3 million years. His only company is the ships computer Holly, a holograph of his deceased, neurotic, room mate come enemy, Rimmer, and a self obsessed humanoid creature, simply called Cat, who has evolved from Frankenstein, Lister's smuggled cat. The humour mainly focuses on the banter and sarcastic comments between Lister and Rimmer, two people who loathe each other but are forced together for company. Holly and Cat, in this first season, play low key parts but have some brilliant one liners.
This two disc set not only contains the entire first series but also a myriad of extras including deleted scenes, `smeg-ups' and commentaries by the cast. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy Red Dwarf, just a fan of quirky, `off the wall' humour.",1122422400,5,2056,4.5896739130434785
1805573,3,B00007AP31,"I was so excited to watch the Red Dwarf Series. My brother had introduced me to the first few episodes as a child, and I only recently took the time to go any further.

  I found the beginning fantastic. Lister (the lowest ranking technician on an immense mining ship, Red Dwarf) becomes locked away in a stasis field for 3,000,000 years to find out that he is the only man alive. His only companions are the ship's computer Holly, Cat, a ""dangerously cool"" evolution of the cat race, and the Hologram of his superior technician and enemy, Rimmer.

  The first and second seasons actually have some direction. Lister wants to go back to Earth and live on Figi. The second episode shows you into the future and further sparks your curiosity. There are some important developments in these first two seasons.

  Then seasons 3-6 are purely fillers. The story is going absolutely nowhere, the situations are ridiculously unrelated to the rest of the series. It is a really disappointment. The characters and past parts of the story sometimes just change with no apparent reasoning. It was like the writers couldn't make up their minds. Though most of the humor is wit, stupid, dry sexual inuendos become rampant.

  Seasons 7 and 8 do pick up the main story a bit and there are some episodes worth watching. The series ends with season 8 on this HUGE cliffhanger, which doesn't bother me too much because the writer is making a movie to continue the series (for which preparations are taking WAY too long).

  Don't get me wrong, the wit is great. Just be prepared for a long ride.

  I give Red Dwarf a 3. Pros are the premise and wit. Cons are the lame filler episodes.",1114732800,4,1668,4.615646258503402
1805574,1,B00007AP31,"I read reviews, more often than not, to read what other people think about stuff that I like. And almost always there's one or two losers who will start with something like ""Am I the only one who thought this sucked?""  I'd hate to be that one for this show, which apparently everyone and his uncle likes.

But I come away after watching the first 6 episodes puzzled why this series is so popular. I don't find it funny at all. In fact, many of the characters are just so annoying. All Lister does is whine and be annoying. The cat is so very annoying, and not not NOT funny at all.

Nothing in the 6 episodes made me laugh, or even smile. I'm so disappointed because I heard a lot of good things about the series.

It's so painfully excruciating watching the show, specially when the cat is on, but I only endured 6 episodes so I can have basis for a review, Chris Barrie was in it, who was genuinely funny as Gordon Brittas (when is Brittas Empire coming out in DVD in Region 1?), and the hope that I would find something about it I liked. But I never did.

1805576,4,B00007AP31,"Red Dwarf is a great comedy series that is a toss up between a sci-fi comedy, or a comedy sci-fi. For me, it's a comedy set in space, sc- fi sounds to geeky to describe this hilarious and long running series.

Season 1 has all 8 episodes, with subtitles and audio commentary on the first episode. And on disc 2 there is an interview about how the show came about, out-takes/bloopers, deleted scenes, trailer, an episode in Japanese with the added updated computer FX edited in like George Lucas murdering the old Star Wars movies, and a bunch more.

I can guarantee that even after here in season one that shows how everything has come about and where it all started for Rimmer, Lister, the Cat and Holly, it gets better with every new season, and keeps getting funnier.

Hidden Egg
- Future Echoes - (Visual Commentary).
On each of the Red Dwarf volumes, there is a hidden visual commentary, like a Flash cartoon of the producers talking about their favourite episode of each season. This first season they talk about the episode future echoes.

To access it. On the main menu, highlight ""select episode"" and then press Right on your remote. You should now have highlighted the bit that says `4691' on the clipboard there. Push `enter/ok' on your remote and the menu will pan left to reveal a combination device. The code is very simple; it's the same as the numbers you highlighted. So enter those numbers and it will begin playing the hidden commentary.",1109030400,5,1456,4.653696498054475
1805577,4,B00007AP31,"I've never seen Red Dwarf and really had no specific interest in watching it.  But my wife rented it, so it was only a matter of time before I was sucked into the madness that is Red Dwarf.

What is Red Dwarf?  Why, it's Star Trek: Voyager.  That not good enough for you?  I speak as a Red Dwarf newbie, so if you're a rabid fan of the series you can skip this.

Still here? Okay: Red Dwarf is actually a ship.  A big, ugly floating city.  It's a mining colony, to be precise, and it's crewed by a bunch of folks who are much like the working blue-collar slobs you might find in any city.  The closest approximation to the atmosphere is the workaday life of the poor saps that get eaten in the movie Alien.  It's grungy, it's gritty, and it's very easy to identify with the crew.

One-armed robots known as ""scutters"" zip around the ship, performing maintenance jobs at the behest of Holly (Norman Lovett), the ship's computer.  Holly appears as a floating head on computer screens; a balding, monotone-voiced face with bad teeth and deadpan delivery.  Just about everything else has the possibility of talking on the ship, from the food dispensers to toasters. Most integral to the technology are the holographics, used to recreate one dead crewmember whose knowledge is too important to the mission of Red Dwarf.  In essence, the hologram is a technological ghost, able to interact with everyone (even sleeping) but incapable of touching or being touched.

Our two main characters are Dave Lister (Craig Charles), an uber-slacker who pretty much doesn't want to do anything but get drunk, high, or laid and his manager, Arnold J. Rimmer (Chris Barrie), an uptight, neurotic stick in the mud.  They hate each other with a passion, a problem exacerbated by Lister's insistence on bringing an illegal animal (a cat, played by...well, a cat) on board.  This leads to Lister being put into stasis, a sort of benign punishment straight out of Judge Dredd: the prisoner is put in suspended animation and doesn't actually experience the passage of time.

Then Something Bad Happens  that kills off everyone on board. Except Lister, who is safely ensconced in his stasis prison.

Three MILLION years pass.

...

That's right, THREE MILLION YEARS.  If there's a concept I had difficulty wrapping my mind around, it's the implications of what it means to have three million years pass you by.  A lot can happen in three million years.  A lot probably SHOULD have happened in three million years.  But Red Dwarf had a small budget to start, so you'll have to forgive the three million questions that undoubtedly pop up about a ship in space for three million years.  I mean, metal degrades in three million years, doesn't it?

Anyway, the assumption in Red Dwarf is that most things kept working as they always did.  Which really does beg the question as to why there was ever a crew in the first place (and perhaps verifies Lister's belief that he may as well slack off as none of it makes any difference).

Lonely and a little crazy, Holly wakes up Lister.  To Lister's horror, Holly uses the holographics to recreate the crewmember ""most important to the mission,"" to keep Lister from going crazy: Rimmer.  Rimmer's more or less the same as his past self, except he has a huge ""H"" glued to his head.  Rounding out the cast is the evolutionary descendant of the cat Lister brought on board, known only as Cat (Danny John-Jules).  Cat is basically Prince with fangs...my wife, who never saw the first season prior to renting the DVD, thought he was a vampire.

If there's a weakness in the show, it's Cat.  He has little to do and is only really amusing to people who have cats, in which case he's either hilarious or very obvious.  He does help liven the show up by hopping around and screeching in colorful outfits in a series that tends to have very little movement.  There's also the dreadful long shots of the model that is Red Dwarf.  These boring pans seem to take place every five minutes and make you really feel like you're trapped on the ship along with Lister.  I'm not sure that's a good thing.

The humor is decidedly British, which is good if you're British and not quite as good if you're not.  There are a lot of references to European popular culture that are easily lost on Americans (I know I was confused a couple of times) as well as 80s references that really date the show.  Still, I was a child of the 80s so I got most of those jokes.

What's amazing about Red Dwarf is its ability to go for the absolutely lowest fart jokes and simultaneously work in high-minded science fiction concepts.  Everything from faster-than-light travel, time travel, and holographic technology is explored at any one point in time.  This can make the series both confusing and surprisingly fresh, depending on the circumstances.

The first season has almost no budget, but that only adds to the claustrophobia.  It does have a lot of funny witticisms, but you have to get past the accents.  Lister slurs a lot of his lines (as well he should), which makes him sometimes difficult to follow.  But I find it difficult to be too harsh with the show...it's like criticizing an off-Broadway show for being off-Broadway.

What's most telling is how much Red Dwarf influenced other science fiction shows.  Star Trek Voyager is an almost play-by-play rip off of Red Dwarf, down to the holographic doctor, the resident comic alien, and the fact that the crew is so far out in space that no laws apply.  The only thing that's missing is hostile aliens, but I'm sure they'll turn up soon enough.

It may not be the most polished production, but Red Dwarf did it first.",1108339200,29,5653,4.639476334340383

Before any real money was thrown at the series, and even before Kryten joined the crew on a permanent basis, the first series concentrated on characters and comedy. This series sets up the characters and the relationships that will carry the show through 8 series. One of, if not the best, series of Red Dwarf and one of my personal favorites.
Th DVD: Having seen (and taped) most of the show off of PBS, I'm glad to finally have this on DVD. The picture and sound is great, and the disc easily navigable. Though not as many as the later series (II, III, IV) there are a good amount of outtakes, deleted scenes, trailers, etc. But the true gem as far extras is the cast commentary on all 6 episodes. Chris, Craig, Danny and Norman share stories of the early years, behind the scenes, etc. Very cool for diehard fans like myself.

So I am more than happy it is now on DVD, especially as two a year seem to be coming out and we are already on Season 4 so roll on Season, 6, 7 and 8 is all I can say!
This is a great DVD.
You get all the first series on one Disc plus loads of other extras on another disc.
And who can forget the first series when we were introduced to the grungiest man in the universe, Lister, the most cowardly man ever (and now a hologram) Rimmer, an ever so slightly insane computer called Holly, and the last descendent of Lister's cat, known only as Cat and eventually Kryten the neurotic but lovable Mechanoid.
This is British humour at its best, and over the years it has improved like a good mellow wine.
I am not going to give an in depth account of each episode, just and overview of the ongoing storyline which is that the Red Dwarf is a deep space mining ship with a crew of thousands.  However due to the ineptitude of Second Technician Arnold Judas Rimmer, that crew has been wiped in a massive radiation leak and the ship left to drift in space for millions of years whilst the radiation dies down.
The only survivor is Dave Lister who was in cryogenic suspension after being punished by the Ship's Captain for bringing a cat on board, Arnold Rimmer's, now a Hologram (that means he's dead but resurrected in the form of a computer simulation but he can't touch anything) and ex-room mate of Lister's and a very human looking descendant of Lister's cat, who has all the vanity and habits of a feline that has evolved over millions of years.
We are treated to a variety of hilarious moments as Dave Lister comes to terms with being the only man left alive on the Space Ship and in the universe, and his reluctant friendship with Rimmer (who he hates and loves in the same breath) his relationship with Cat and eventually the Android (called Mecanoid in the series) Kryten who joins them in one episode in Series 2 and then becomes a permanent feature by Series 3.
There is also Holly, the ship's slightly mad computer, after all he has been alone for a VERY long time and two Scutters (repair robots) who have also become a little demented over the years, they both belong to a John Wayne fan club!
This is well worth watching, and if you don't become addicted after the first ten minutes I'll be very surprised and you'll be a Smeghead!
You also get the full six episodes on one disc, a collector's booklet and another disc full of extras such as cast commentary, deleted scenes, isolated music cuts, photo gallery and a lot, lot more!",1082419200,3,2703,4.352475247524753
1805580,5,B00007AP31,"In Britain a TV show like Red Dwarf gets only six episodes a season, compared to the 20-plus common in the US. The good news is that, with all their efforts bent toward a mere six eps, they can make those the best six episodes possible.

Red Dwarf is the name of a mining spaceship. The first episode in the series - called, paradoxically and charmingly, ""The End"" - introduces us to Dave Lister (Craig Charles), uber-slacker and lowest ranking person on Red Dwarf, and Arnold J. Rimmer (Chris Barrie), stupid, rude, officious control freak and second lowest ranking person on Red Dwarf. (Obviously AJR is destined to become the series' most popular character.)

Since Lister is the only person he outranks, AJR of course dedicates most of his waking hours to making Lister's life hell. This would work if Lister gave a damn about anything Rimmer might say or do. Instead he regards Rimmer with the total contempt usually reserved for a high school stoner contemplating a junior ROTC cadet who takes himself WAY too seriously.

A horrible accident kills the entire crew except Lister, who emerges from suspended animation millions of years in the future to find himself a long, long, long, LONG way from Earth, his only companions the computer personality Holly - I have to point out the obvious play on 2001's HAL (played as slightly dense by the wonderfully deadpan Norman Lovett); a humanoid cat (Danny John-Jules) whose main occupations are eating, sleeping and admiring himself; and his old pal Rimmer, generated by the ship's computers as an intangible but visible hologram, surviving to badger Lister millions of years after AJR's own death. Talk about the gift that keeps on giving.

In this first season, the lack of a serious budget shows. The sets are drab in a Blake 7 kind of way. In one scene, showing much of the crew of Red Dwarf at a banquet, jackets are thrown over seat backs both to add a bit of color and hide the fact these are all modern, cheap cafeteria chairs. Almost all the budget went into building the sets; the Red Dwarf mock-up; and robotic ""scutters,"" cute as hell, small janitorial robots (which never worked well, an ongoing source of irritation for everyone making Red Dwarf). Every episode takes place on the ship, simply because there was no money for location shooting. Series creators and writers Doug Naylor and Rob Grant had very little power to control the show during this first year. Otherwise they would've done things differently regards set decoration, direction and character development.

For all that, even in these early episodes Red Dwarf has SOMETHING. The ""something,"" of course, being the relationship between Lister and Rimmer, the Odd Couple of outer space. Over the years this relationship would be expanded upon, and modified somewhat, but its rock solid appeal was there from the very start.

I'd been told for years before watching this DVD that Red Dwarf was a ""very confusing series, hard to get into, but stick with it, it's worth it."" For years after its introduction, because every Power That Was considered the first season so inferior to what came later, the episodes on this DVD were never rebroadcast, either in Britain or the US. I can see where this would be a confusing series to jump into in the middle, not knowing the backstory, why Lister is stranded on Red Dwarf, that Rimmer is a hologram, etc. Since my first exposure to Red Dwarf, by contrast, was watching Series 1 on DVD, to me it made perfect sense.

This two-disk DVD set was obviously a labor of love for the people putting it together. It's been given top drawer treatment all the way around. The quality of video transfer is excellent, the colors (such as there are) crisp, the audio clear. The second disk is chockful of amusing ""extras."" The only negative, to my mind, is that the enclosed Red Dwarf booklet, while very well-done, reveals secrets from later seasons. While I'm sure this is all old news to longtime series fans, as a new fan whose first exposure to Red Dwarf was this DVD, I found it a bit irritating.

Buy this DVD, it's the perfect introduction to one of the most imaginative, funniest television shows ever. If you have any liking for science fiction, or any sense of humor at all, you will love it.",1075852800,6,4258,4.7523680649526385

Of course, I've always thought that if you filled a starship with the people I've gone to school and worked you'd get something quite different. Remember that kid who was always crashing his bike, setting the chem lab on fire, or dropping delicate devices...? What if he was, say, in charge of safety on an intergalectic starship? He'd get everyone killed.

A few millions years later when the radiation had died down, he's taken out of suspension by a computer who has gone quite mad in the interim, and finds that his only companions are a holographic projection of the most annoying man on the ship- yes, the one who's killed everyone off- and the last descendant of his cat.
Season one sets up the basic premise, introduces the characters, and explores the ship.

1805583,5,B00007AP31,"RED DWARF is a series that came out during a time when there was a major strike in Brittain.  The show had a lot going against it and a comedy in a sci-fi based series was something that BBC wasn't quite supportive until they realized how much of a hit they had in their hands.  With the many wonderful reviews already on Amazon, I'll more or less discuss if the casual viewer of sci-fi or non-BBC watcher would enjoy RED DWARF.  First and foremost, although this is sci-fi and came out during the same time Star Trek: The Next Generation was out in America, please do not think this is a serious show.  As a matter of fact, keep your mind open and do not compare this series to any sci-fi show.  Also, I want to say that I give this DVD a perfect rating because they went all out and put many things on this series 1 DVD from outtakes, featurette, the Japanese version of the series which shows the edited special effects of the show and more.  As for the series itself, things get better as the series progresses, season 1 is more or less funny actors working on a miniscule budget and the things you learn from the included booklet and the featurette, you get a feel of what it took to make this show a hit despite the budget and the crisis they went through during the electrician's strike.  Now for my friends in America who ask me to compare it with another series or movie in terms of what kind of humor.  This series is quite hard but it does have the zaniness and dissing like ""The Young Ones"" but the comedy in itself is that the last human alive happens to be the dimwit crewmember they put on stasis along with his deceased partner who is a hologram, the computer and the cat evolved to a human who looks like he is a big fan of James Brown.  It's something you can't compare to anything and it's quite unique.  The first series pretty much focuses on Lister as he must cope of being the last human and getting along with whatever he can with the ship.  But this being a unique show, if one has an open mind, I truly recommend giving it a shot.",1061596800,5,2056,4.232736572890025
1805584,5,B00007AP31,"There is already a glut of minutae floating around in cyberspace regarding the storylines of this cult series, so I will focus on the DVD itself. The BBC have outdone themselves with the release of Series 1 (& 2), and one hopes this sets the tone for future installments.  It is these early episodes that benefit the most from digital remastering- i.e., finally cleaning up the fuzzy visuals and muffled sound (and knowing that you can watch an episode all the way thorough without the interruption of a 20-minute PBS pledge break!).  I have never laughed so hard at Series 1, because frankly, the sound was SO bad in the broadcast versions that I was missing half the punchlines. Many reviewers comment that Series 1 was the ""weakest""; I wonder how many of those people have watched the uncut DVD version before offering that opinion. The real gift on the DVD is the actors' commentary track-which is funnier that the episodes themselves at times. You get the feeling that these guys really enjoyed working together and still get a kick out of each other's company. You also can hear the actors genuinely cracking up at some of the punchlines, which displays the strength of the writing (always the series' strongest suit). Timelessly entertaining (and if you find yourself a little depressed, good therapy!).",1059350400,4,1310,4.869955156950673
1805585,5,B00007AP31,"Red Dwarf is undoubtedly the best sitcom ever, it's smart, funny and done with a razor-sharp wit rarely seen elsewhere. Ignore anyone who says otherwise, there is no point in missing a T.V treat like this one simply because of some bad reviews.
 The series really works thanks to the classic setup; there are only two people left in the universe and they're trapped together on the space vessel Red Dwarf. The only problem is that they HATE each other.
 Everything in this show is amazing and worth every cent, even season one, which is done on a miniscule budget (and it shows). Although later seasons have more special effects (and the carachter of Kryten, the funniest T.V android ever), this season is just as funny as the others and really sets up the Lister/Rimmer relationship (the Cat doesn't feature much this season).
 I recommmend this to anyone with a taste for comedy, sci-fi or both. This is the best series ever to emerge from British television and, for its price, is certainly worth the money, especially when you can watch the episoides time after time without it losing its edge.
 Forget any bad reviews, buy this. If you don't, you're going to be missing out on something amazing.",1054944000,3,1200,4.7272727272727275
