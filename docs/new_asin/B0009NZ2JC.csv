8063882,3,B0009NZ2JC,"Decent story about underdog pro team - but is often told through weak interviews and low quality race footage.

First half of the film is slow, we hear about why the wife of one cyclist likes being a teacher so much (helping people) and the race sequences cut from very amateur fixed shots of racers going by to post race commentary on what was happening at specific points in the race but not really captured on camera.

Things pick up in the second half of the film as a few big races are covered in detail with better video footage that follows groups of riders for longer.

Overall, I enjoyed the film but it is not nearly as good as other cycling docs I've seen (hell on wheels, lance armstrong road to paris, etc) and I'm dissappinted I spent so much money to buy it.",1357862400,2,773,4.317241379310345
8063883,3,B0009NZ2JC,"This is a rough cut documentary about the Net Zero cycling team. The film provides a somewhat illuminating view into the world of a few rookies entering professional cycling.

There are, however, some fundamental flaws. The director straddles the fence on whether to target an audience of cycling fans or a more general audience. It's a tough thing to do, and I can't say that they've done a great job of that here. There are some nice simplifications to ease the way for those unfamiliar with bike racing, but they frequently slip into platitude. As a cyclist, I was a bit dissapointed in the lack of sophistication in the narration.

As a small technical note, the sound editing is rough, creating a pressured narration that is distracting.

The fundamental flaw with this movie is that it remains fairly superficial. There is little insight into the racers themselves. They do a great job of interviewing the wives of two of the rookies, raising some tough issues on balancing competition with obligations to family. The movie never goes back to follow through on the issues they raised. The movie ends with the last race of the season, leaving a number of important questions unaddressed. It's a shame the filmakers didn't do a more comprehensive job. Professional cycling is a sport that requires obsession, not just commitment. The material is ripe for a compelling documentary. I think the filmakers just missed the bar here.",1128556800,24,1432,4.933609958506224
8063884,5,B0009NZ2JC,"So, you want to follow in the footsteps of Lance Armstrong?  You might want to watch this DVD first.  This is the story of the NetZero pro cycling team.  It shows the sacrifices required to get a foot in the door of pro cycling.

Very interesting documentary, explains pro cycling in basic terms that someone new to the sport can easily understand!",1120608000,8,348,4.564516129032258
