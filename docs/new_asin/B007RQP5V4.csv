8521493,5,B007RQP5V4,"Two funny and wonderful Bob Hope and Bing Crosby favorites remastered beautifully by DigicomTv. Wonderful sound and video quality on both films.

Road to Bali:  George and Harold, American song-and-dance men performing in Melbourne, Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as pearl divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, Indonesia. They vie for the favors of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala, a cousin of the Prince. A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own.

An undaunted, Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen next.

My Favorite Brunette:  The story is told in flashback from Death Row as Ronnie Jackson (Hope) relates the events to a group of reporters the events that lead to his predicament. Jackson is a baby photographer who dreams about being a real private detective like his friend Sam McCloud (Ladd). One day he is mistaken for a detective by a mysterious lady in distress (Lamour) and soon finds himself involved in a murder mystery.

These are both really great films for the entire family. Wonderful classics you will enjoy again and again......",1385424000,,1504,4.832684824902723
8521494,4,B007RQP5V4,"ST. CLAIR's ""signature"" series each consist of three public domain movies (on a single DVD) that are good, but not always the featured artist's best work. In this case, only two theatrical films are offered. The third item is an episode of the Jack Benny Program that includes a brief skit of Benny, Bing Crosby and George Burns trotting out an old vaudeville softshoe routine. Hope appears near the end of this sketch.

The Hope, Crosby and Dorothy Lamour ""road picture""  franchise was still going strong a dozen years after it had begun when their sixth entry, ROAD TO BALI (filmed in Technicolor), was released. Here, our two song-and-dance men (Bob and Bing) hastily depart Melbourne, Australia to avoid some marriage-minded ladies. They take jobs as sea divers and on the way to Bali meet up with lovely Princess Lala (Lamour).

In MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE, Bob is a baby photographer mistaken for the private eye who occupies the office next door. Soon entangled with bad guys Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney, Hope's hilarious misadventures land the poor schnook on San Quentin's Death Row.
