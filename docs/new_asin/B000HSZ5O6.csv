For me it's one of those movies that was scarier back then... Still, ""Eyeball"" is a fun romp. I'd sure love to find this on DVD, English language or not!",1369612800,,303,4.333333333333333
8140984,5,B000HSZ5O6,"If you are a fan of the Italian Giallo genre - you will LOVE this movie from the great Umberto Lenzi.  (if not a fan of the genre, it may not be for you).  The movie is set in Spain where a group of American tourists are on a sightseeing tour.  Great Spanish scenery, and 70's fashion add to the fun.  As dead bodies begin to pile up, it appears that a killer is lose amongst them.  There are so many plot twists and turns that it's virtually impossible to guess who-done-it until the surprise ending reveals who the killer is, and why they have been gouging out the left eye of the victims.  This movie is a rare find.  It is currently not released on DVD in English.",1328918400,2,668,4.131782945736434
