8032793,4,B0002VEPGC,"Basically, the 2 circuit DVD's are well structured and pleasant workouts, not too easy and not too tough. Consider Circuit 1 as a basic DVD, Circuit 2 as an advanced DVD - the main difference is that it lasts longer and is set at a higher pace. Definitely good value for money, and together with the original advanced and the Tae Bo 2 Get Ripped Advanced my favourite Tae Bo workouts.",1178668800,2,384,4.422535211267606

8032795,1,B0002VEPGC,"These two workouts were a great disappointment.  Having enjoyed the workouts of the original Tae bo tapes I was looking for a updated version but found with the Circuit workouts I barely broke a sweat, was bored and wanted my money back.",1110412800,9,237,4.642857142857143
8032796,5,B0002VEPGC,"I have been doing the Tae Bo workouts by Billy Blanks for the last couple years now and love them. The newest DVD's - Tae Bo Circuit 1 & 2 are similar to the original Advanced Tae Bo tape in that they are very fast paced but easy to follow and enjoyable. The workouts are quick paced and are not boring like sitting on an excersise bike. I highly recommend these to someone looking for an advanced cardio workout with strength training and toning that doesn't have a lot of time to workout, average DVD is about 40 minutes.",1104796800,16,523,4.292929292929293
