2836651,5,B000QDCB8A,"First I'd like to point out that I have an original letter from Ira Levin whom I wrote long ago to ask if I can help him write a sequel to the amazing Rosemary's Baby; both the book and the film are astounding!  He said no but added that his friends have advised him against it and ultimately he actually did write a dreadful sequel, not at all the type of follow up I had meant when I'd written him; I wanted to explore good and evil and instead he just turned the entire story into both boring and ending awakening, in other words, turning it into just a nightmare!  I felt completely burned but besides that in the letter he wrote me that having nothing to do with him a horrid sequel was made where Adrian became a rock star which is this masterpiece of confusion which now unfortunately skips for me.  I have put it on many times because I still have no idea what is going on.  I am amazing that Ruth Gordon took on this role and give her tremendous credit for that.  It's a great film; while uneven and confusing it still constantly holds your interest.",1414195200,,1059,4.248756218905473
2836652,2,B000QDCB8A,"LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ROSEMARY'S BABY is, of course, the totally unnecessary sequel to the original classic. Unfortunately (fortunately?), Mia Farrow wouldn't touch it w/ a thousand-foot pitchfork, so Patty Duke fills in as mum for the Mephistophelian offspring. Those people who may have thought that Ms. Duke's acting was a tad histrionic in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, need to watch her come completely unglued here! When she's not screaming every five seconds, she's staring goggle-eyed at everyone! Sheer awesomeness! Rosemary takes little Adrian (now called Andrew) on the run from the coven / cult of Satanists who seek to help raise the lad in the image of his daddy. After killing some pesky bullies, Andrew is kidnapped by Tina Louise (yep, eeevil Ginger!), and whisked away to inherit his destiny. Years later, Adrian is all grown up and ready to assume his place as head honcho among the devil folks. The one saving grace for this entire debacle is Stephen McHattie (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE), playing the adult Adrian w/ wicked abandon. He's believable as the devil spawn. The rest of the movie is pure made-for-TV cheeeze of the limburger variety! As sequels go, LWHTRB is typical, in that it possesses none of the strengths that made the original movie a classic. It's also intensely dull. It is groovy though, especially when Adrian has his face painted and discovers his inner rock star! All heck breaks loose! Ray Milland (X: THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES, THE PREMATURE BURIAL, FROGS) plays Adrian's ""godfather"", Roman Castevet, and Ruth Gordon -the sole veteran from the first film- returns as Minnie Castevet. Also, watch for Broderick Crawford as the sheriff, and Donna Mills as Ellen!...",1404000000,3,1700,5.010600706713781
2836653,4,B000QDCB8A,I've got this movie on vhs and for you youngsters that's video tape. This is a classic 70's horror genre film and sure it's kind of a cross between the first Rosemary's baby and woodstock because of all the hippie music and disco kind of feel but it has something I can't quite put my finger on other than to say it brings back nostalgic memories of a time long since gone but fondly remembered. All horror fans my age I think will agree that if you see this movie it will somehow make you feel like a kid or at least teen again. Ahhh those good ol days. I miss em.,1303430400,8,565,4.053571428571429
2836654,3,B000QDCB8A,"Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby (Sam O'Steen, 1976)

I first saw this flick when I was still prepubscent by a number of years-- it may have been when it was first shown on TV (which would have made me eight years old)-- and I thought it was about the best thing since sliced bread. (Oddly, I was never able to appreciate the original movie until recently.) I'd been trying to track it down for quite a while after that, but never had any success until earlier this month. Now, every review of the movie I've read since (including some unsolicited ones offered to me by... oh, it's a long story) has ranged from bad to worse. I couldn't be misremembering it that badly, could I? Well, for one thing, I swore up and down Telly Savalas was somewhere in this flick. Whoops. Still, I've been exposed to both Rosemary's Baby sequels-- this film and Ira Levin's own sequel Son of Rosemary-- and, honestly, this one's better. (I can't believe everyone who read the book wasn't put off Levin forevermore by that horrible, horrible cop-out on the final page.)

Anthony Wilson, probably best remembered as the man who adapted the Planet of the Apes franchise for a TV series, scripted and produced this made-for-television dog directed by Sam O'Steen (Queen of the Stardust Ballroom). We see Rosemary's baby, alternately named Adrian and Andrew, just as in the original, in two stages of his life. First off, we see Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) taking Andrew, now eight years old, and fleeing New York with him. She is tracked down by the seemingly nationwide network of friends the Castavets (Ray Milland and Ruth Gordon, the only two actors to return from Polanski's movie) have, and control of Adrian is passed on to Marjean Dorn (Tina Louise), a nightclub owner somewhere in the American southwest, as Rosemary is dealt with accordingly (in one of the film's more memorable scenes).

Then we see Adrian all grown up, now played by Stephen McHattie (recently of All Hat) in one of his earliest roles.  Adrian's been palling around with a straightlaced guy named Peter Simon (the late David Huffman)-- could the symbolism really be less subtle?-- and the Castavets aren't liking it. It seems that for the son of the devil, Adrian isn't really living up to expectations. So the Castavets call in Rosemary's ex, Guy Woodhouse (here played by George Maharis), to sort out the Simon kid and get Adrian back on track. Murphy's Law kicks in, and... well, you'll have to see for yourself.

Taken for what it is-- a low-budget made-for-TV shocker that was probably cranked out in a week and a half while everyone involved was between projects-- it's not a bad little movie, really. Certainly better than about half the flicks I've seen this month (and I've been doing a lot of movie watching). As the cast list should tell you, the acting is competent (and I somehow managed to leave out Broderick Crawford!). The direction is less so, but it's not as bad as it is in some of the amateur horror flicks I've seen recently. The script is nothing special, though it's not bad. In other words, it's a mediocre flick that stands watching maybe once every twenty years-- but still, that's a lot better than most folks are saying. One IMDB reviewer says ""Ira Levin deserves an apology."" He's obviously never read Son of Rosemary. ** ",1227052800,10,3325,4.724137931034483
2836655,4,B000QDCB8A,"Contrary to the first post, this is not a bad film.  I loved it when I first watched it in 1976, granted, I was only 12, but it has stayed with me through the years.  The way this movie is done, it will really surprise you, especially who Rosemary's Baby's best friend is.  I am disappointed this one is not available anywhere to rent or buy, etc.  Has anybody tried watching ""The Sentinel""?  This is a really good horror flick as well from the same time frame.",1206144000,11,461,4.252873563218391
2836656,3,B000QDCB8A,"This really isn't a bad film. The sequel actually has some suspense and a surprising twist at the end. This movie however, dosen't compare to the original great horror classic.",1203811200,4,176,4.9
2836657,1,B000QDCB8A,"I have tried ordering this from three different Amazon marketplace sellers. One sent me the wrong film, and the others cancelled my orders. I have heard similar complaints from other people. It is an awful movie, and Patty Duke's worst film, but I want a copy just for her.

8195813,3,B000QDCB8A,"This TV movie has some great stars but falls short of the superbly crafted Polanski film.  The only returning cast member is Ruth Gordon who gives another great performance. Ray Milland also stands out. Patty Duke is good as Rosemary, but is only in the first few minutes. It's cool seeing Tina Louise before Dallas, as well as Donna Mills, but the story falls flat.  George Maharis looks good as Guy.  No special features, just the 1976 TV movie.",1507852800,,447,4.632911392405063
8195814,1,B000QDCB8A,"Terrible movie but great cast.  Like others mentioned I only bought it because I'm a fan of Patty Duke and wanted to see Tina Louise, Lloyd Haynes and Ruth Gordon.  Ruth Gordon didn't have any of the spunk she had in the original.

The movie is missing what the original had--a great script.  I thought it was boring and it had no plot.  This one should have stayed in the vault.",1492819200,,379,4.28169014084507

8195819,3,B000QDCB8A,"What can I say? My motivation for purchasing this movie was purely based on nostalgia. By no means a great movie, it was a lot of fun to revisit this  one. It deals with Rosemary Woodhouse's son, Adrian,  played by a young  Stephen McHattie ,who is now a young adult. It's fun to see a cast which features Patty Duke, Tina Louise, ( yes, ""Ginger"" of Gilligan 's Island), and a few others. It really is just for fun as far as I'm concerned. Don't expect anything more than that, or you will be immensely disappointed. But really..  if you saw Rosemary's Baby, a true classic among horror films, haven't you at least at some point, wondered what became of little ""Adrian?""  Well, this provides you with the chance to find out, although you may very well walk away feeling that many things are best left a mystery. Only do this for nostalgia or fun!  ; )",1448236800,6,851,4.388535031847134
