7771535,5,B01H1WK2D4,"How can anyone give less than five stars? This is worth at least four stars for Paul Mooney alone. If you believe Richard Pryor was, is and always will be the greatest comic of all time, then you will not be disappointed.

Mike Epps shows some seriously improved chops not only in comedy but his acting as well. It's quite possible he could blow up to be a heavyweight dramatic player in the very near future.

The acting is relaxed and top quality from the entire cast and the direction is tight and slick.

THIS is how you make a comedy. Highly recommended for all Epps fans and equally for Pryor fans. 5 stars.",1469750400,2,613,4.359649122807017
7771536,2,B01H1WK2D4,"""Rich people don't purge."" Carl Black (Epps) has finally found a way out of Chicago and his dangerous neighborhood. He and him family movie into a huge mansion in a gated community in Beverly Hills. They are just settling in when the thing they most feared arrives. The Purge exists in the richest city in the country, and they are the only black family around. Things can only go bad. This is a strange movie. This is not really a spoof in the usual sense. This is really more of a remake of The Purge movie done as a comedy instead of a horror. Unlike the Scary Movie series it doesn't take from all other movies. There are some funny parts in this but it did seem to drag a little. The two biggest problems with this movie however were the over used cliche racist jokes. We get it, your black so even when crime is illegal you will get caught...very funny. The biggest problem with the movie though is that the actors didn't look like the wanted to be in this. That really hurt the comedy due to the fact that you almost felt sorry for them. Overall, Some people will enjoy this but as for me the movie was only funny in some parts, and only because I saw the original Purge. I give this a C.",1466985600,11,1195,4.222707423580786

The quick jokes keep it entertaining.
The only reason I wouldn't give it give stars, is because the movie does start to fall off during the middle/end But still occasionally redeems itself with Mike Epps humor.
Nice comedy, would definitely recommend if you're a fan of the comedians in this movie.",1466640000,3,499,4.813953488372093
7771538,2,B01H1WK2D4,"Carl Black (Mike Epps) absconds with drug money as he takes his family to lie low in a gated community in Beverly Hills. Being a dead beat, Carl has a lot of people looking for him leaving behind including baby mommas. On the night of ""The Purge"" they all come looking for him, even the clown ( Mike Tyson) he stiffed from his kid's birthday party.

This is a spoof of ""The Purge"" and perhaps needed a better title. The bulk of the humor is racial and inter-racial as we contrast red bones vs. black people. I would suppose the African-American community will enjoy this comedy more than I did. While the film had its moments, the humor grew old with all the accidental and misdirected deaths.

I started watching open-mindedly and at first liked that it was a Purge movie with a sense of humor. Mike Epps' interaction with the African document-server in the beginning was funny. But then as it wore on I realized that this was a spoof movie, and it began to resemble other spoof movies in silliness and stupidity (and stereotyping). Sometimes there are genuinely funny or insightful moments in spoof movies, but I didn't encounter those moments in this film. Granted, it's genuinely funny at times.

7771563,1,B01H1WK2D4,"This is supposed to be a spoof of ""The Purge,"" I guess, but it doesn't do a good job of it at all. The title is the first sign they got it wrong, since ""Meet the Blacks"" doesn't tell you anything about the movie.

Carl Epps plays a former criminal who steals drug money to escape his crime-ridden life and moves his family into a wealthy gated community in Beverly Hills. Set in the world of the Purge, where crime is made legal for one night a year, he hopes to be safe because ""rich people don't purge."" But as a black family, they become a target of their white neighbors during the annual Purge.

I think there's definitely a place for a parody of ""Purge,"" although I don't think it's a famous enough movie yet to warrant it. But I was open to this being a good movie, because I think anything can be a target of comedy. But when the movie starts with Snoop Dogg in whiteface trying to do a white accent, explaining the Purge, I knew the movie was in trouble. Then Epps has to argue with the security guard of his housing community to let him in, because (of course) no black people allowed! Yeah, that's the kind of humor this movie goes to. In the next scene, he gets in an argument with an African man trying to serve him a summons on the front porch of his house, and they hurl racial slurs at each other. There's no real purpose to the exchange, except for an African and an African-American to insult each other. At that point, all hope of a decent movie was lost.

Forgiving the racial stereotypes, the movie feels like a standup comedy set at the Apollo padded out to two hours. ""If black people were in the Purge, it would be like this!"" But the original Purge movies had black people in them, so the racial context has already been addressed. This movie is just an excuse for the cast to string thin jokes together with a lot of mistakes along the way. I mean, Epps' son thinks he's a vampire and wears plastic fangs all the time - that's something that sounds like it would be funny, and might be in a straight comedy, but it seems thrown into this movie in an attempt to add more laughs to the already weak story.

I'm amazing they managed to get this made into a feature film. Even released it to home video is a stretch. ""Meet the Blacks"" should have been released on YouTube instead of movie theaters.",1482192000,,2320,4.277904328018224

A spoof on ""The Purge"" starring Epps with Snoop Dog in the background should have been hilariously thought provoking.  This was not hilarious and the only thoughts it provoked is wth.  I forced a laugh a couple times. I asked my husband what he thought, he said about what, oh that I wasn't paying attention. He lost interest after a half hour. The story as presented was disjointed, clich and basic.  If it was supposed to be about the Black's escaping crime ridden Chicago leaving behind ""that life"" with each of their faults, mistakes and bad choices to start over in the pristine no crime that anyone hears about fairy tale land Beverly Hills let it be about that.  Pepper in that plot the Meet the Blacks realization their obnoxious white neighbors don't want them there, and they intend to take full advantage of the Purge...  The Blacks and Cronut load up bring it let the mock purge begin Chicago vs Beverly Hills style....  Certainly enough material and doses of reality for rolling on the ground laughs with a strong message delivered only as M Epps can. Or is it about their lives in the crime ridden Chicago as they each tried to survive doing what they had to do to survive including deal with pay back coming your way for ripping off anyone and everyone in your life. Here comes the mock Purge Chicago style. Same deal enough there for a plot of rolling over laughs with a strong message delivered Epps style.  Well don't know what they were trying to do.  It seemed it was an attempt to integrate both concepts. It didn't work.  It was so fragmented it was incoherent with no beginning no middle no end except for a lead in at the end to a sequel.

7771630,5,B01H1WK2D4,"This movie is about a Chicago family who move to Beverly Hills in hopes of starting a new life.  But ""purge day"" is here.  Purge day is where anyone is allowed to kill someone (usually someone who did you wrong in the past).  Carl Black is played by Mike Epps.  He and his family are characters!  His son, Carl Jr., likes to pretend he is a vampire.  His daughter is a typical young, fast, cutie who has some secrets.  His cousin, Cronut, is a fool!  He did time for parking tickets, but is out now and can't stop looking at Carl Black's wife.  This movie is silly, but very entertaining and very funny!  I like it a lot.",1472860800,2,621,4.186440677966102

Sat through it because I love most of the main/side cast. Few laughs. Needs 10 mins of horrible jokes and acting cut. Felt sad for the cast while watching this because of the wasted use of their talents. Was yelling at movie basically the entire time.  Waste of time and money.,1470873600,4,456,4.7
