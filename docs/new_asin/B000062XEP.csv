Since then, I've seen and taped it several times, but I was always disappointed by the video quality.  Now that it is on dvd, I can watch it anytime I want!  If you like romantic comedies, pick this one up!",1040428800,,302,3.9833333333333334
1685351,5,B000062XEP,"I have watched this film over and over and I still enjoy it every time. It is a warm and fuzzy film, like a cup of hot chocolate. I like the fact that the main female character was a then plump Ricki Lake who does not fit the usual mode of anorexic size 0 heroines we're so used to seeing on TV and film.  What makes it even better is this BBW is able to land her handsome prince.  It's a type of ""ugly duckling to swan"" story in which Grace, in her determination to catch her man, transforms herself from a quiet, plain, colorless creature into a vibrant, stylish, confident woman.  Rob (Craig Schaffer) discovers he and Grace are on the same wavelength; he finds himself enjoying Grace's company compared to that of his uptight, intense fiancee Olivia, who is bent on controlling and conforming Rob. He realizes a traditionally beautiful woman is not always the best choice, and begins to view Grace with new eyes. We see the somewhat rivalrous relationship between Grace and her new stepmother Wanda, who always takes little pot shots at Grace about her weight. When Grace appears with Rob stylishly dressed and confident, Wanda acts surprised and jealous. With the help of Rob, she is able to counteract Wanda's little digs and prove to her that she doesn't have to conform to a certain standard of beauty and size  in order to land her man.
I would LOVE IT if Ricki Lake and Craig Schaeffer could reprise their roles and do a sequel of this movie, so we can see what happens with the characters.",1039219200,18,1500,4.5036764705882355

I bought this awhile back here on Amazon,glad that I did. Price is too high now.

Ricki Lake also has the opportunity to prove to herself she's worthy of respect, and a better job. There are many golden nuggets of truth contained in this 1989 film that are timeless.

1685449,5,B000062XEP,"Grace is a Mortuary Makeup Artist with a heart of gold.  Grace is also lonely and overweight.  Everyone keeps telling her how good she would look if she would just loose weight and how she'll never get a boyfriend if she doesn't lose weight.  Grace has one friend, Carrie, who has a dismal outlook on life despite her high intelligence.  Grace and Carrie notice a handsome, fit, movie star looking ice skater one night.  Grace decides he is the man for her and sets out on a 3 week course over Christmas to catch him.

Grace and Rob fall in love, dispite their obvious physical differences.  Grace shows amazing dedication to Rob, but in the process manages to hurt Carrie.  Another aspect of this movie is Rob's ""bunny"" girlfriend Olivia, who is currently out of town, allowing Grace her chance at Rob.

All goes haywire when Olivia returns to town to find Rob not home, not at work and not ice skating.  Carrie lets it slip that Rob is with Grace at a new year's eve party.  When Olivia finds them, she manages to tear Grace down and do nothing to Rob, since it is always the woman's fault.

You see Grace return to her job and life after Rob.  The sad thing is that she returns to sad Grace.  But she decides that she is ready for some ""live action"".  Grace decides to go on without Rob. She is heading off into her new life when Rob sees her, happy and on her own and decides that he does truly love Grace and declares it to everyone and Grace on the subway.

This is a cute love story.  There is minimal cussing, but there is the aspect that Grace and Rob are carrying on an affair.  But to show that love has no boundaries despite physical appearances is great!  I truly loved this movie!",1178496000,3,1694,4.32063492063492

It is one of the best romantic comedies that I have seen in recent times, which is why I'm surprised that more people don't know about it. The storyline is pretty standard (overweight, pessimistic girl think she can't find love - but runs into the man of her dreams), but yet the movie was done in such a way that it seemed realistic and not too fairytale-like. It has a universal appeal, especially to those of us who have been through periods of our lives where we felt low about ourselves or negative about finding true love. Although Ricki Lake's character is ""overweight"", this movie would appea to any woman because the feelings she has in this movie are ones that relate to just about any woman, no matter your size or shape.

This American version is indeed a sweet remake, but not as dark as the original. In the original film (which I prefer), Marianne Sagebrecht plays the Ricki Lake part. In it, the makepup artist for the dead spends much of the time trying to get the conductor on the train to notice her. She eventually wins his affection briefly. The difference is how the relationships are handled. In the original, the main character hs no friends or family in the area. She doesn't end up a winner, either. In fact in the original film, she is confronted on a dancefloor by the conductor's girlfriend, who calls her disgusting and beats her in front of everyone...she ends up ultimately alone...Zuckerbaby is highly recommended for anyone that has seen Babycakes..",1057881600,6,1055,4.834254143646409
1685471,5,B000062XEP,"When I first watched ""Babycakes"" years ago on television, I immediately fell in love with it! Ricki Lake does an excellent job playing Grace, an overweight lady with a larger-than-life personality and an even larger heart.
The story revolves around her struggle to ""fit in"" and finally have a boyfriend. Grace and her friend spot and handsome guy named Rob while ice skating, and Grace makes it her mission to make this guy her own. She tries just about everything, but the one thing that really got him was her ability to be herself and not worry about what others thought about her. It was through her relationship (both good and bad aspects) with Rob that gave her the self-esteem she desperately needed. The movie concludes with a happy ending that will leave a permanent smile on your face!
I highly recommend this film to anyone who would like to see an excellent, heart-warming film. This film really does let you know that you don't have to be the size of a model model to find true love, happiness, or respect and adoration - a lesson that so many people should learn. :) Watch this movie!
