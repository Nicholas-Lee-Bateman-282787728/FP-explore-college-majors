8223926,5,B000WMEAWA,"I have this lecture on CD (I guess the DVD version simply shows him lecturing). A superb lecturer, this one on the Brontes is one of his best. He has a light and natural delivery, and infuses his lectures with wit and interesting tidbits. I also recommend his lectures on Charles Dickens (his specialty; indeed, years ago he started a group known as the Dickens Diciples) and Mark Twain. If nothing else, go to his website (authorsink) and purchase the CD version.",1199664000,,464,4.670731707317073
