8694741,5,B00RBTXGDQ,"This is a pretty fun film.  Basically a guy gets kidnapped by three guys who are sort of his friends, because they have been hired to rob a card game being played by British underworld figures and the deal is off if they don't have a fourth.  They try and trick him into being the getaway driver but he's more mad at them than cooperative.  So they knock him out and plan for him to regain consciousness in Thailand where they will live their remainder years having one big party.  However their plane is detoured due to a volcanic eruption and grounded in Lithuania, where the three robbers decide to party and sleep with women anyway.  Of course the regained consciousness guy has no idea where he is.  When he works out he decides to take the money and return to England, however he doesn't plan on his taxi driver robbing him.  Basically this film has a lot of things go wrong for the trio robbers who wake up in different places, the guy knocked out and the British gangsta's as they run into various Lithuanian criminals, most dumber than the one before.  But it's a lot of fun!  There's plenty of crude humour and violence if either of those things aren't your thing, than you're best to give this a miss.

It's obviously not the most believable of story lines, I can't imagine you can get someone on a plane who isn't conscious, even if somehow you have their passport.  I also don't know why a plane going from London to Bangkok would go so far north of it's flight path to have to land in Lithuania.  But who cares!",1477094400,2,1525,4.387900355871886

8694743,5,B00RBTXGDQ,"Hostel (2005) meets Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Hangover trilogy .  What the Lithuanian movie director Emilis Velyvis did is simple and ingenious.  He took the widely popular British crime story with its typical cynical British humor and set it in Eastern Europe (Lithuania).  Consequently the result of that is the film Redirected (2014) which can allude to the flight that our main protagonists take to Thailand after not-so-elaborate heist, but do to some not-foreseen weather conditions their plane gets redirected to Vilnius, Lithuania.  The British mobster (Vinnie Jones) whose gambling money and precious signet-ring (personal item of highest importance) gets stolen by our three heroes-- follows them all the way to Vilnius, where cultures and fists are destined to collide.

If you are a fan of British crime films like Snatch (2000), Layer Cake (2004), Dead Man Running (2009), Rock n Rolla (2008), The Crew (2008), Revolver (2005), etc., or anything with Danny Dyer and Simon Pegg, than you are here for a treat.",1423872000,2,1042,5.178571428571429
8694744,3,B00RBTXGDQ,"Michael (Scot Williams) is looking forward to celebrating his birthday with his girlfriend Jessica. However he is highjacked by some mates and they use him as a driver as they knock over Vinnie Jones with specific directions to take his ring. Vinnie of course figures out where they go (Lithuania) and a pursuit follows.

The film is a combination grindhouse and comedy. Unfortunately the film's comedy is more akin to 60's Italian comedy than smart British wit . For instance in one scene a nude man is chained to a radiator, which he liberates and carries around for half the film. The film seemed misdirected at times. Much of the film has English subtitles with jokes aimed at a Lithuanian audience. Scot Williams was not convincing in his role and he was the only character they developed.
