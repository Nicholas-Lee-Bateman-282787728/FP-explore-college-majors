2062182,3,B00024JC3U,"Starsky and Hutch gaining cult status - who would have thought it? I remember the original tv series during the 70s. It was okay. Nothing special. Quite frankly, The Streets of San Francisco was better. However, Starsky and Hutch are as 70s as disco music, and I suppose that gives it a certain retro appeal. I watched this film with certain misgivings and those misgivings were certainly justified. Although the original series always had a nice balance between action and humour, this film is played strictly for laughs and make the two characters out to be a couple of idiots. It's almost like a remake of a Laurel and Hardy film. Some homage! They also get the character of Huggy Bear completely wrong. In the series, he is on the skirts of criminal activity and he makes a little extra money by informing the police. However, in the movie, he is a successful crime boss who has no need to make a little extra money, especially as being a police snitch would seriously jeopardise his reputation - something he would have to be stupid to do. I should also point out that Snoopy Dogg -Christ, what a name! How on earth does that give him any street cred? - cannot act to save his life. Not since David Bowie's performance in ""Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence "" has there been such a lamentable lack of talent and charisma on the screen. He does not so much act the part as read his lines out loud. After saying all that, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do have a certain chemistry between them and the film is quite fun to watch. One to catch when it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do.",1087084800,,1589,4.426621160409557
2062183,1,B00024JC3U,"As much as Ben Stiller liked playing cops and robbers and pretending to be Starsky as a kid, he shouldn't have bothered acting in this movie, neither should have Todd Phillips bothered with his lame jokes and meandering plot.
This dumb-downed remake has nothing in common with the series
(that ran from 1975-79)except for the clothes and the car.
Neither character portrayed here was similiar to Glaser's & Soul's roles (Ben Stiller had to wear a wig!!)and the jokes
seemed to make more fun OF the series rather than being funny.
The original series Starsky & Hutch was a crime drama that at times, didn't take itself too seriously, but tackled hard-hitting
subjects in it's day.
To make a spoof or parody and the inevitable exploitaion of a series that still has a large fan base is
disappointing.
It is worth mentioning that the originals Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul have a small cameo at the end of this movie.
Buy the first season of Starsky & Hutch on DVD instead for action and drama, with a little comedy mixed in.",1085702400,4,1028,4.653846153846154
2062184,3,B00024JC3U,"I remember having a discussion with a friend, once, about people in high school and how there are three groups of them - (1) the ones you hate, (2) your friends, and then the third group: the people that you could live without, but you simply don't have the energy to actively dislike them...so you're nice to 'em. Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself.
  The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.
  Then again, S&H can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).
  When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither. It tows the line and makes it a worthwhile experience in the end, and an albeit hilarious one, at times. It's occasionally dumb, it has an interminably slow first act, and I can't say I'd watch it again. I can't say I didn't have fun the first time, either. GRADE: B-",1084665600,3,3390,4.660535117056856

2062242,4,B00024JC3U,"OK, it took me ten years to get around to watching this. I avoided owning a TV for a lot of the 70's, until my parents sent me one (via Greyhound bus!) as a gift.  Turned it on, and there was ""Hee Haw"" (corny country western variety show). Turned it off.

But, if you lived through the 1970's and were observant, this movie does capture some of the rancid absurdity of the time.  And, yes, the fascination with coke.  But where were the 100% polyester leisure suits?

Unlike movies that try to re-create ""hippies"" or people in the 1940's and never get it, this movie was pretty close to the cheesy mid to latter 1970's.  It is almost uncomfortable to watch, especially if you had a sense that the 70's was really a tasteless decade and you knew it because you were trapped in it.

But in a sick way, I liked seeing it again. Watch it back-to-back with ""Confessions"" (about the Gong Show guy) to get all the 70's you can handle.",1424908800,,927,4.323699421965318

2062283,5,B00024JC3U,"This is a film that, despite its purposefully goofy moments, took itself seriously and the resulting effort just lit up the screen.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson team up in this modern-day look back of one of America's classic buddy cop series.  I've never seen the original Starsky and Hutch episodes, but seeing this really makes me want to.  As Stiller and Wilson assume the roles made famous by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, they investigate the murder of a drug pusher and try to prove that a much larger conspiracy is in the making.  They joined by many others from the ""brat pack"", none of whom overdo it in the humor departments they are so well known for.  Somehow Will Ferrell, appearing in an uncredited cameo, manages to be both over-the-top bizarre and under-the-bottom restrained...watch the movie to see what I mean...his performance just works.  But my favorite in this film is Snoop Dogg, who plays Huggy Bear, the leading duo's ""urban informer"" who later reluctantly upgrades to a more hands-on role in the investigation.  He is just hilarious all the way through.  I especially like his first reaction to Starsky's Ford Gran Torino.  Overall, this is a buddy cop movie that, along with the series it is based off of, is the sort of thing all buddy cop movies should try to achieve.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have a great chemistry throughout, even making it work when they don't know and/or like each other.  I now want to watch the original Starsky and Hutch, who are actually somewhere in this film, though I won't say where.  Enjoy.",1403049600,,1562,4.723247232472325

2062285,4,B00024JC3U,I recall when this came out . I passed on it at the time . Had a night to kill and watched it .Its a bit off a spoof on the original show . I loved the show in the 70s but it certainly seems outdated to watch the originals if you watch it now . This spoof added some humor to the old formula and it worked at times. The cast is pretty strong . Will Ferrell is always funny when he takes a limited role . Vince Vaughn and Snoop dog join in . Stiller and Wilson are Starsky and Hutch . Of course the 70s music is fun addition to the film . The bad reviews on this film I don't get. This is a solid 3 star if you like spoofs. . To me  this was funnier cause I know the original show as it was a fav of mine back as a kid in grade school.  Just some of the 70s images played up is funny to me.

2062286,2,B00024JC3U,"I saw this movie when it came out in 2004. I was 12 years old and when I first saw this movie, I used to think it was funny (which was before seeing the original Starsky & Hutch). Once I saw the original show, I changed my mind about the movie. I thought the movie had one hilarious scene in it, but overall it sucked. However, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson sucked in this movie. They don't play the role of S&H like Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul did. The only funny scene I saw in it was the scene with Will Ferrell talking about Dragons and Starsky & Hutch getting caught on Camera doing this stupid act to please Will Ferrell's character. Some major points: Starsky wasn't a stuck-up prick in the original show, Hutch was not a dirty cop (like they portray him in the movie), Snoop Dogg was pretty funny as Huggy Bear in the movie, but nowhere near the acting that Antonio Fargas had done (as the original Huggy Bear), Captain Dobey (Portrayed by Bernie Hamilton in the original) wasn't a crabby old bastard in the original show like he is in the movie, and Vince Vaughan was so-so as an antagonist, but they could have used someone better. The only way you will like this movie is if you hadn't seen the original show. Also, this movie shouldn't have been a spoof and should have focused more on what the original show was like. Otherwise, they should not have bothered making this movie. I didn't get the point of having the original S&H show up at the end. Their appearance was so brief and it just made the ending really confusing. If you really want to know which of the two (the original show or the movie) to watch, pick the original show. I own all 4 seasons and they're all good. You will like it a lot better than this awful remake.",1397520000,,1748,4.316109422492401

By the way, I owned a 75 Gran Torino.  That thing would be destroyed after even the smallest jump in the movie, or easily disabled if it hit a curb on an angle as mine did once (and as the original car did in one episode).  In fact, Glaser reportedly hated the car and tried crash it into stuff at every opportunity.  I think the movie makers remembered the Dukes of Hazzard or Knight Rider when they thought up the stupid jump scenes...  There were no car jumps in the original TV show, although it had its share of car chases.

The original TV show was groundbreaking, dealing with then-daring subjects such as homosexuality, child abuse, police brutality, rape, and many other topics. David Soul (the one and only Hutch) and Paul Michael Glaser (the one and only Starsky) created memorable characters with a deep, lasting bond. It's still remembered fondly by many fans.

This piece of excrement simply takes the time frame (the 1970s), the names of the characters, their jobs, and the trademark car, and makes a complete toilet bowl full of sewage.

One of these days, people will realize the obvious: Owen Wilson cannot act. Ben Stiller cannot act. Ditto Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. The best way to kill a movie, any movie, is to put either Wilson or Stiller in it. It's cheaper to just use a cardboard cutout of either of them; cheaper, and probably far more entertaining.

2062337,5,B00024JC3U,"This action comedy drama movie of STARSKY & HUTCH pertains to 2 streetwise undercover cops in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975 who drive around in a red '74 Ford Gran Torino, bust criminals with the help of their underworld boss Huggy-Bear(Snoop Dogg)and the movie functions as sort of a prequel to the TV series that ran on ABC from 1975-79 as it portrays when Dave Starsky(Ben Stiller)was first partnered with Ken Hutchinson(Owen Wilson), except the movie also switches the personalities of the title characters.

For instance on the TV series, Starsky(Paul Michael Glaser)was always curious and streetwise & Hutch was more of a tough by-the-book police officer, but in this movie Starsky(Ben Stiller)is a loudmouth wannabe macho cop & Hutch(Owen Wilson)is a cool, laid-back, easy-going detective, but the 2 are wary of each other at the beginning when the duo is reluctantly assigned to be partners by their hard-nosed superior officer Capt. Dobey(Fred Williamson).

The story centers around 2 cops who eagerly work for the Bay City Police Dept. in a city that has distinct Southern California atmosphere to it, especially since Bay City is very similar to L.A.

Additionally, this movie also made and formatted everything to look exactly like things did back in the 1970's, including cars, hairstyles, clothing, music, disco, etc., plus they played a lot of popular oldies from the 70's like ""Use Me"" by Bill Withers, ""Back Where We Started From"" by Maxine Nightengale, ""We've Only Just Begun"" by The Carpenters, ""Cocaine"" by Eric Clapton, ""That's The Way I Like It"" by KC & The Sunshine Band, ""Afternoon Delight"" by Starland Vocal, etc.

It was also cool how in the last scene Huggy Bear surprises Starsky by buying him another Torino from the original Starsky & Hutch duo meeting face-to-face with the new duo when Paul Michael Glaser reluctantly gives the keys to the new Torino to Ben Stiller showing us that Glaser & Soul were obviously too old to do this flick with their wrinkles & gray hairs & that Stiller & Wilson were a more compatible choice to do this movie since Wilson & Stiller are as young as Soul & Glaser were during the series whole 4-year run on ABC.

This movie also takes me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was still the president and Senator John Kerry lost the election in November of 2004.",1227139200,,2437,4.820574162679426

""Starsky and Hutch"" is well written and directed with a stellar cast including Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the title roles and featuring Vince Vaughan, Jason Bateman, Carmen Electra and a hilarious performance from the great Fred Williamson as the police captain. Some examples of the hilarity: Starsky and Hutch's captain (Williamson) regularly calls the boys on the carpet using hilarious profanity over their misguided efforts at law enforcement. Starsky tries to convince a suspect to confess using a fake game of Russian roulette. What Starsky doesn't know is that there's really a bullet in the gun (and the suspect speaks Korean and can't warn him). Starsky and Hutch go to arrest a suspect not realizing that his kid is a knife-throwing martial artist - the kid's dad keeps yelling to the kid in Korean ""throw more knives."" And perhaps the most hilarious of all: a disco dance off between Starsky and some overweight king of ""Saturday Night Fever"". Starsky is high on cocaine, which he thought was sweetener and poured into his coffee. There's much, much more. The 70's setting and music are terrific. The stunt driving and other action is great. I was never a real fan of the series, but I loved this take-off. And yes, the original Starsky and Hutch have a cameo. Oh, and Snoop Dogg is perfect as Huggy Bear.

But it is funny, good natured and doesn't outstay its welcome too much. The only real bum note is giving the final glory to Snoop's terrible Huggy Bear, a charmless, boring and lazy performance constantly outshone by his own bodyguards.",1202860800,,697,4.67479674796748

2062351,3,B00024JC3U,"I can't really say how this movie compares to the popular T.V. show from the 1970s.  I was only 6 years old in 1975, and STARSKY & HUTCH came on after my bedtime.  I may have seen a couple of episodes, but all I remember vividly is the trademark red Grand Torino with the white stripe.

Insofar as the car is concerned, it has been resurrected for the current movie.  I am inclined to believe that the humor of the movie is much more of the slapstick variety than any humor displayed in the T.V. series.  There is one curious aspect about this remake, however:  unlike most remakes, this one takes place in its original epoch of the 1970s as opposed to being an ""updated"" rendition that takes place in the present day.

By far & away the weakest part of the movie is the inclusion of Snoop Dog.  He is absolutely the worst actor that ever lived;  every scene he is in, is like taking the air out of a balloon.  Trying to teach him to act is like trying to teach an alligator to be a vegetarian.  He is probably the most talentless self-made millionaire the world has ever seen - bar none.  I would beg Snoop Dog to kindly disappear from the public eye - the world would be a better place for it.

I am puzzled as to why it went the route of being rated PG-13.  After all, nobody under 35 would even be aware that there WAS an old T.V. show called STARSKY & HUTCH.  It had some opportunities for gratiutous nudity that would have made it a good old-fashioned ""R"" Rated slapstick comedy.  For some unknown reason, it shied away from this and ended up being a teaser flick.

As for the rest of the movie, it is OK.  Nothing great, nothing terrible.  For some, it might be nostalgic as it goes back to the 1970s.  Other people, including me, will have nightmares about DISCO making a comeback (yikes!).  If you pick up this DVD w/out expecting a whole lot, you should be fine.",1184457600,,1872,4.2763532763532766
2062352,2,B00024JC3U,"Big screen remakes of 70's sitcoms have given us ""modern kids"" a chance to enjoy some bellbottom antics that we otherwise would have missed out on. With a star-studded cast lead by Ben Stiller (Starsky) and Owen Wilson (Hutch), this film calls to all who are ready to be launched into ha-ha arcadia.
The stage is set right after you are introduced to the dynamic duo. Stiller is an uptight cop who serves the law to the utmost. Wilson is a laid back cop who just wants to take it easy. Let's pair them together! Holy, freaking-f! Where did they get that idea? It's awesome!
As the film builds up momentum with a prodigious and inexhaustible stream of jokes we meet Huggy Bear played by rapper Snoop Dogg. Why isn't this man in more movies? His acting is absolutely awe-inspiring (except that it is bad and I don't care for it much at all). In the 90's he popularized the alcoholic drink ""gin and juice"" and taught us that ""endo"" is the best marijuana to smoke. Now, in 2004, he is stupefying audiences with his rigmarole on the big screen. Boy how the times change. Speaking of change, let's not forget the antagonist, a villainous drug dealer named Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn. Let me tell you straight up: this is not the Vaughn of old. Long gone is the quick-witted fun time swinger who gave a fairly decent vocabulary base to a generation of young hipsters. To make sure you're not confused, the character displays his wrathfulness early so you don't cry when/if he gets busted. How? One, he has a moustache. Two, he kills guys that loose his coke and doesn't even care about it. Three, he never says ""that's money,"" ""hey, you are money tonight,"" or ""sexy babies for me and for you that are money."" F that guy! I kept thinking throughout the whole film: you are sooooo busted in 70 minutes. So what about the plot? Basically, Starsky and Hutch somehow must find the bad guy through a tangled web of ridiculous humor, mishaps and total babes. If you were smart enough to figure out how to operate the DVD player you can see the jokes coming from a mile away. The real mystery I'll leave you with is this; can the two cops see through their differences to form a law enforcement juggernaut (like Robocop but with less buffoonery) and a possible lasting friendship in 90 minutes?
On a personal level after seeing this film I really wished that Owen Wilson was my bro, that guy would be awesome to do the ""what's up"" thing with.
Modern day filmmakers have somehow managed to take their non-creativity to a whole new level, much the same as Puff Diddy does with music. If you have lost your creative go ahead and take an idea that has already been done, inject a bunch of your own non-creative and you will have teens and adults alike reiterating phrases like ""do it, do it"" until the Knight Rider movie comes out. I personally can't wait till I'm 40 and I see the remake of Wayne's World.

2062357,5,B00024JC3U,"There's an unwritten formula: when a dusty '70s show gets branded cool again, a shoddy and blasphemous remake is quickly shunted out by soulless studios, made hastily and carelessly enough not to miss the boat before Open All Hours gets its comeback. Scooby-Doo did it, and- sorry if you were in the process of wiping this one out of your memory- The Avengers did too. But somehow Starsky And Hutch avoids remake clichs by revelling in the irony goldmine left vacant by the TV show.

Top marks go to the casters for revolving the film around trusted comedy performers rather than straight-faced, perfectly groomed Hollywood big-shots. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson- who tickled the world together in Zoolander and The Royal Tenembaums- have now perfected the geeky, uptight but loveable goon and laid-back chick magnet. Snoop Dogg has a go at stealing the show in his 15 minutes of screen time as Huggy Bear- a role he seems to have spent his whole life emulating.

Despite the absence of a Wilson writing credit, the script strikes a balance of comedy and wisely simple plot. It's never laugh-out-loud funny but then, with heavy dollops of nostalgia, irony and references to navigate through, it's no problem.

2062377,3,B00024JC3U,"""Starsky & Hutch"" is not the worst movie made from a TV show...that list is way long...but it's not that good of a movie either.

Other reviewers have outlined the plot, such that it is.

It's clearly made with a lot of care. The soundtrack, the sets, the dialogue, the hairstyles...it's ""fun.""

The screenplay is lazy, but it's sort of like lazy in a ""70's TV show"" kinda way, so this might be intentional. Owen Wilson's wisecracks are occasionally funny, but are also anachronistic. Ben Stiller adds another ballistically whacked-out character to his resume...he's fearless in his goofiness, surpassed only by Will Ferrell (who has a small, extraordinarily weird part in this film) among our current actors.

Much has been said about Snoop Dogg, and his casting is fine. He's not an actor, but he's funny enough being Snoop-as-Huggy Bear.

Many other actors, like Fred Williamson, overact to the point of absurdity, while somebody like Jason Bateman barely registers as Vince Vaughn's compadre. Vaughn is solid, as always, with the lines he's given.

While watching the film, we sometimes became impatient. Lines fell flat. Scenes just didn't work. But as the movie progressed, it did gain some sort of momentum where we did want to know how it ended.

That may be faint praise, but I know all of you have seen movies where you couldn't care less how it ended because they were that bad ot that boring.

This isn't in that category. It's funny in spots, but not uproariously so.

I will say this: the ending was worth waiting around for.",1123372800,,1539,4.821292775665399

At first, I did not think I was going to like it at all.  I do not really care for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson all that much and I found their other collaboration, ZOOLANDER, a complete travesty.  But in the first five minutes, I felt the film had some promise.  However, as in some of their other films, I feel that you either love watching these guys play themselves or you do not.  Neither of them is able to create dynamic characters.  Instead, they just simply play themselves in every movie and let the cards fall where they will.  Of course, I realize that there are some pretty serious fan clubs out there for both of these guys.  Thus, if you are someone who loves watching either of these guys, then you will probably get a kick out of STARSKY & HUTCH.  But if you are not a fan of these actors, then there really is not a lot here to justify the expense of purchasing the DVD.

Of course, there are some winning moments.  The trumped up ""partnership"" of these two guys gets to be quite funny at certain points and Will Ferrell's brief performance is a scream, as always.  I never saw the original TV show, so I cannot comment on the film's ""accuracy.""

Ben Stiller is as always Ben Stiller, no more, no less. The movie is a crackup, there is just no two ways about it. Snoop Dogg is an interesting character, although I was a bit on the clueless side about his role. It think they needed to explain what he was just a little bit better. fashion statement or detective. Or both. I'm not sure.

The Brady Bunch movies were funny because they captured the essence of the show and then infused the satire. This movie captures the look and feel of the 70s, but Stiller and Wilson are NOT playing Starsky and Hutch. They are playing Stiller and Wilson in Starsky and Hutch clothing.

Starsky was not an uptight, humorless stiff as played by Stiller and Hutch was not a crooked, bribe-taking cop as played by Wilson!

I'm not an indignant fan who says ""How dare they!"" Just a fan of the old show -- I was a high school girl during its intial run and their posters adorned my bedroom wall -- who feels that if you're going to parody S&H, get it right and don't simply use the premise as a vehicle for Stiller and Wilson's familiar schtick.

Stiller and Wilson have superb chemistry, and seem to be having a really good time on screen. The cast is further complemented by solid performances from Snoop Dogg as informant Huggy Bear, and Vince Vaughn as the cocaine-smuggling Reese. Todd Phillips, who directed the grossly overrated ""Old School"", faithfully recreates the 70's feel of the show, right down to the songs used in the film. Naturally, a television series which becomes a movie isn't complete without the original actors from the show in cameo appearances, so look for Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch)in a clever sequence. I was quite surprised at just how entertaining ""Starsky & Hutch"" is, given the generally vague memories I have of the original show.

2062401,3,B00024JC3U,"""Starsky and Hutch"" is a genuine surprise, a clever and funny sendup of not only the popular TV series from the 1970's but all those cop-buddy scenarios that have flooded screens both large and small for decades now.  The convention in these tales is to take two cops with diametrically opposed personalities and team them up as fearless crime fighters.  Thus, we have Starsky, the stuffy, by-the-book, idealistic cop who takes his job seriously and actually believes he is making the streets safe for law-abiding, paired up with Hutch, a laid-back, cynical pragmatist who has no illusions about the nobility of his profession and no qualms about bending the rules when he sees the chance of getting a little personal gain out of it.

""Starsky and Hutch"" has a great time poking fun at the cliches of its genre, never taking itself or the era in which it is set too seriously.  In fact, the movie does a fine job satirizing the fashions, trends and music of the 1970's in all their kitschy, tacky glory.  In a clever in-joke, the movie has Hutch singing an acoustic version of ""Don't Give Up On Us,"" the sappy number one hit recorded by the original Hutch, David Soul, in 1977.

Of the actors, Ben Stiller steals the show as Starsky, bringing to the character a quality of deadpan seriousness that makes him a sympathetic figure even as he becomes more and more the butt of the movie's jokes.  The screenplay spins many a convention of the cop buddy movie on its head.  For instance, invariably in these films, one of the cops has a father who distinguished himself years earlier as a model officer on the force, and now his rookie son has to live up to the family reputation.  In this case, however, it is Starsky's MOTHER who set the standard for bravery and courage in the precinct and Starksy knows he cannot let her memory down.

Owen Wilson is somewhat less effective as Hutch, mainly because the character has been conceived as essentially the same wisecracking slacker Wilson plays in virtually all his movies.  Still, the two actors generate an effective rapport on the screen, one that helps us over some of the rough spots that set in from time to time.  For indeed, the movie, like most big screen comedies, can't sustain the hilarity through the entirety of its running time.  Nevertheless, ""Starsky and Hutch"" does a better job than most at making us laugh and does so without ever insulting our intelligence.  That's quite an accomplishment, actually, in this day and age.",1103760000,,2487,4.713625866050808

2062406,3,B00024JC3U,"This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.

Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.

The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy with a dragon fetish who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.

The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal.

And the car is back (though it seems like they crunched about a dozen or so Gran Torino's in making this movie).  Set in the fictional ""Bay City"" (though it still looks as much LA as any of those cop shows supposedly set in NYC), ""Starsky & Hutch"" has our heroes working together for the first time to take down a crime lord (Vince Vaughn) set to flood the city with a new form of cocaine utterly undetectable by police dogs.  Will they be forced to rely on a local ""businessman"" named ""Huggy Bear"" (Snoop Dogg)?  You bet!  Will they earn the wrath of their Captain (Fred Williamson)?  You got it!  Will they be torn apart, yet rise above it and learn to work as a team?  No problem.  S&H is good clean fun - aside from a knife-throwing kid, a three-way kissing match between Hutch & 2 cheerleaders, a near case of ""Russian Roulette"" and a disco-dance challenge that goes bad.  The jokes are fun, but it's a thin movie - sort of like a stretched version of the ""Sabotage"" video done nearly a decade ago, in which all the hazards and professional hurdles of being an LAPD detective were compressed into a few minutes.  None of the jokes are that new - and most of them are sight gags (the ridiculous size of electronics, old cars and hair-dos, and how the cool people of the time look incredibly stupid and unattractive).  Though it hails from the same TV era as ""Charlie's Angels"" it's not quite as energized as either of the two ""Angels"" movies, could have used some more car-chases, but it's still a load of fun.",1098057600,2,1740,4.4715189873417724

2062411,4,B00024JC3U,"Like another reviewer said here, I wasn't impressed with Dodgeball. I thought it was ok, but nothing special. With that in mind, I wasn't really all thrilled to see Starsky & Hutch. After watching the DVD, I came away with a new respect for Ben Stiller.

Stiller isn't the only one in this movie, but he is the one who you can tell makes the flick. As you all know, the movie is based off of a 70's TV series. It's about two cops who sometimes cross the line of the law to get the job done. Sometimes with humorous results. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson play their characters perfectly. Stiller especially, has the Starsky character down pat. The film was directed by Todd Phillips. I enjoyed ""Road Trip"" & ""Old School"", so that was a plus to me.

The plot of the film isn't really that deep, to be honest. A drug kingpin (Vince Vaughn) kills one of this henchmen and Starsky and Hutch are put on the case after the body washed ashore. Along the way, the two cops get into all sorts of fun and crazy situations. There is scene after scene of laughter. This is one of those movies where you will be talking about scenes with your friends and even imatating the characters. When you see the scene where Stiller plays a character with the catch-phrase ""Do it. Do it"", you will know what I mean. That little phrase has now become part of my regular vocabulary, for better of worse.

The acting is quite good here. Ben Stiller is amazing. You can see his comedic genius here even along side his buddy Owen Wilson. I will admit they do play off each other quite well, but I have never been impressed with Wilson. His voice drives me nuts and I think he is a terrible actor. If anyone reading this has wasted time out of their lives to watch ""The Big Bounce"", you will know what I mean.

Along with Stiller, Vince Vaughn takes the movie. Once again, he is amazing. I have loved him in every movie I have seen him in and he is great here as the villain. While not playing the typical psychotic, over the top badguy....he plays a slimy, but yet funny & cool badguy. Snoop Dog is also very good. I couldn't think of any other actor that could have played the role of 'Huggy Bear' more perfectly. He took the role and just owned it.

Honestly, I wasn't too geared to see this flick. After seeing it and laughing like crazy for 100 min., I could highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants a good comedy.

Special Features: There is a decent commentary track with the director Todd Phillips. He isn't too bad on it, and is insightful enough to keep you awake. I wish Stiller and Wilson would have been on it, but I guess they were too busy. There are deleted scenes. There are a few that I was really happy they kept out, but some could have been in. There is a short featurette with Snoop about his wardrobe. The gag reel is kinda funny. Most of it is just people messing up lines. The best supplement is the ""promotional featurette"". It starts off like one of those crappy ""everyone kisses everyone's butt"" ones, then it goes into the actors all complaining about each other and the director. They basically just trash the movie and complain about everything. It's hilarious and I wish more movies would do this. You can tell this cast had a lot of fun making the movie, so this was a riot.",1096070400,,3282,4.345840130505709
2062412,2,B00024JC3U,"Starsky & Hutch is a flawed comedy that, considering the talent, could have been far more than it ended up being. Stiller, one of the most talented comic actors of his age, here goes for shallow caricature rather than developing a true shallow character.  Where it worked for him in Zoolander it fails here.  In fact it's as though Stiller decided to ape Zoolander playing Starsky.  An interesting premise perhaps, but its execution falls fairly flat.

Owen Wilson doesn't give much more, and doesn't fare much better.

The duo are not without some funny moments, but overall there were long stretches of nothing padding out the comic bits.

The film is worth watching primarily for the performances of Vince Vaughan and Snoop Dog's Huggy Bear - both breathing life into an otherwise fairly stagnant vehicle.

Also worthwhile is Juliette Lewis in an inflated cameo is wonderful, and more than any other cast member, embodies the sexual innocence gone haywire that seemed to fuel the 70's.

Hard to believe Chris Penn in the role he has here.  Completely unrecognizable.

Even harder to believe is that this was directed by Todd Phillips, the director who gave us the unflinching, hard hitting documentary ""Hated"" about the twisted, revolting life of punk anti-hero G.G. Allin. Phillips would go on to impress in the comedies Old School and Road Trip.  Faced here with a period piece he relies too heavily on site gags (oversized portable phones, radios, etc.) which cannot alone carry a film.

These types of films fail because they are all surface and too little substance.  The original Starsky & Hutch seems funny to us now because there was a sincerity in respecting the material.  The material may not have been great, but the premise was and the execution by David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser nearly perfect.

Phillips has been announced as the director for The Six Million Dollar Man with Jim Carrey.  Smells all wrong to me.",1095897600,,1933,4.883435582822086

Will Ferrell is hilarious in a brief scene - it's really too bad we don't get to see more of him. If you classify yourself as the stereotypical man's man, the film will be worthwhile for two reasons: 1) Starsky and Hutch (as in the original series) drive an awesome car and 2) you'll get to watch Carmen Electra kiss another girl.

Reasons not to see this movie: Again, as indicated by the title, without the chemistry between Wilson and Stiller, this movie would've been a complete disaster. The only funny parts in the movie (besides Ferrell's scene) come from the back and forth banter between Wilson and Stiller. The word from most of the critics was that Snoop was hilarious as Huggy Bear, but I didn't see it. He did well in the role, but he wasn't actually funny.

Stiller and Owen Wilson play Starsky and Hutch, two opposite-end types partnered together to police crime.  In what is one of the most brilliant casting decisions ever, Their pimp-informant Huggy Bear is played by Snoop Dogg...which is really just such effective casting it's hard to come up with new adjectives to say how clever it is.  Stiller and Wilson effectively master their characters quirks (Where in the WORLD did the costumer's ever find that hideous Starsky cardigan!?!?), and the story, while not the stuff of brain surgery, is light and entertaining.  It's a well done 70's TV to screen in much the same way Charlies Angles 1 was:  It manages to stay true to the show, while still satirizing it's material.

If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.

The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.

The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song ""Don't Give up on Us"". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.

Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark. However, the action scenes and the nostalgic value are enough to recommend watching this movie.

Even so, I was expecting to have a good time, enjoying the antics of our dynamic duo, but instead I found this film eyeball rollingly CHEESY. Stiller overacts each and every scene and looks ridiculous with the curly hair. Wilson is good as Hutch, but comes off as too much of a black sheep. These  characters were just too inept to be believed. The best scenes by far are those which included ""Huggy Bear"" played by Snoop Dog.

The plot? Hardly worth mentioning, but Starsky and Hutch are after a dealer who sells 'odorless coke.' When the two run afoul of this bad boy they must follow every possible lead including a man who loves dragons (WAY too much), a biker bar, and a cheerleading squad. You get the picture.

Which brings me to this movie. I like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, both very talented guys. This could have been great instead it was full of low end cheap dialogue and situations. It has absolutey nothing to do with the original series regarding wit, character or integrity. It shows these chacters as bafoons.

He reminds me of a less intelligent Dennis Miller, always trying to come across as cute but without the wit.  Blah!  Then there is the flimsy and altogether predictable and flat script.  It made me wonder how on Earth the producers managed to get so many ""name"" actors for bit roles.  When the drug-deal story goes stale(as it frequently does) Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are called upon to improvise by wearing ridiculous costumes and managing to sneak their way into various locations.  The script even calls for the obligatory passing of the torch from the original actors who starred in the television show by having them hand over the keys to that very cool car.  The best thing about the show was the car, not the acting or the predictable tough-guy dialogue.  ""Let's come up with a new movie idea based on an antiquated television show!""  Sound familiar.  Here it is again.  The only redeeming factor in the entire film(other than Carmen Electra in a cameo as a cheerleader, ouch!) is Ben Stiller.  He seems to be the only person concerned with making this once popular iconic television show into a parody, which is the only sensible thing to do.  He has a few outright hilarious scenes and plays a few other characters that are crazy and quotable.  It's just too bad no one else shared his energy or his vision while making this otherwise dumb film.  As far as Snoop Dogg playing the character Huggy Bear...hoodlums waxing intellectual has been done before.

2062428,3,B00024JC3U,"This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.

Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.

The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.

The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal.

These two actors make a brand new comedy team and you won't be disappointed in this film if you enjoy the way they tag team off one another for a laugh. Of course Snoop Dog does a great job as Huggy Bear too and the red and white Grand Terino takes on the original car with a few new tricks!

This movie is a great laugh and an evening of nostalgia for people who grew up watching the original series. Many scenes are re-created almost to a perfect tee!

I can think of only three laughs in the film, and they were all from Vaughn's laidback responses (""Hey guys I think I can speak for the rest of us when I say we're all MIMED out"").  A couple of chuckles elsewhere, maybe.  Jason Bateman is completely wasted in this.  Snoop Dog comes out ok, I guess.  The movie is too in love w/ its retro feel to present some gut busters that you'd expect from a movie starring Wilson and Stiller.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to be a big comedy?  Zoolander, a movie panned by critics, had far more laughs than this.

Stiller brings in a character from his hilarious short lived skit-show, the Ben Stiller show, the ""Do it...DO it!"" guy, and I think that's just symbolic of the movie as a whole--trying to borrow the laughs from other material.

And when they run out of ways to make fun of afros and other sundry items of retro fashion, they resort to leering at bimbos (enter Carmen Electra and Amy Dumb), making what starts out as just harmless junk into callow, obvious junk.

Most of the 'jokes' seem targeted at the 13-18 year-old male demographic. On a humorous scale of 1 to 10, it scores a magnanimous 0.5 -- idiotic and disturbingly reliant on a conversance and affection for a television show that most of us remember as being about a red Grand Torino if we remember it at all.

2062439,5,B00024JC3U,"when i first heard of the movie, i thought to myself well another boring movie with probably no backbone story just like Charlie`s angels (i love the original series, but the movies don`t do justice at all!) but then i saw the theatrical trailer i and i knew it was going to be awesome!!! why??? first of all, the actors, owen and ben have such a great chemistry together that they overshadow tag teams like richard and gene, among others, they know how to make it work, i mean it`s not the first time they`ve worked together, if you`ve followed the series you know they had a slick urban coolster friend called huggy bear and who better to play that part than mr. Snoop Dog, i mean c`mon man the combination of these three players is an explotion ready to happen, but if that`s not enough you also see great acting by vince vaugh, juliette lewis, carmen electra among others. From the beginning of the movie you know you`re in for a treat as barry manilow`s ""can`t smile without you"" starts things off, as we travel to the seventies (1975) and we enter the world of starsky and hutch. then they present us the two main characters and from the genesis of the movie we know what we`re going to experience, now i`m guessing that this is the origin of the friendship of these two fellas, which everybody knows it turns out to be a long one. Another great touch director todd phillips made was capturing the essence of that particular era with the clothes,way of life and great songs (the score is my favorite and a important piece if you will of a movie) with artists like chicago, sammy johns and the carpenters (i hope i spelled it correctly) and lets not forget when hutch sings ""don`t give up on us baby"" and vince dancing to the tune of ""feel like makin`love"" was out of this world!!!!! the story was well written making it work for the entire cast creating a fun movie and a hilarious outcome!!!! if you haven`t seen it yet do yourself a huge favor and buy not rent BUY this dvd `cause its worth every penny!!!! trust me!!!! saludos a tavo y roxana!!!",1091577600,2,2054,4.436507936507937

2062442,4,B00024JC3U,"Let's be honest, most cinematic remakes of classic TV shows are awful. They either barely resemble the original (like the Claire Danes version of The Mod Squad) or turn it into kitsch parody (like The Flintstones). More often than not the contemporary update pales in comparison. As a result, there was a healthy dose of skepticism when a remake of Starsky and Hutch was announced. Would Hollywood ruin yet another vintage TV show?

Surprisingly, the movie is not an out-and-out parody but plays things fairly straight. It is set in the 1970s and actually has a story that one can follow instead of the typical M.O. of these kinds of films that simply string together a bunch of loosely connected comedic set pieces.

Starsky and Hutch is a vehicle tailor-made for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's comedic talents. Stiller plays Starsky as an intense, by-the-book cop, while Wilson's Hutch is the laid-back, loose cannon. You would think that after all of the films they've done together their schtick would have gotten old by now. However, they play so well off each other. Their comic timing is dead-on. The give and take of the dialogue between them is effortless and enjoyable to watch as the mellow Hutch constantly baits the easily flustered Starsky.

There is an audio commentary by director Todd Phillips. He dishes a lot of trivial factoids on this rather bland track.

""Fashion Fa Shizzle Wit Huggy Bizzle"" is a brief tour of Huggy Bear's funky retro outfits and stylin' pimp wear with Snoop Dog. Not surprisingly, ol' Snoop displays a real knowledge of `70s fashion.

""Last Look Special"" gently makes fun of these kinds of puff promo pieces as Stiller, Wilson, et al ""talk trash"" about director Phillips. This is a fun, little extra.

There are several deleted scenes that run six minutes in total, including one that has Starsky lecturing Hutch about peeing in public. There are some funny bits here and it's a shame that many of them were cut out.

There is also a five minute ""Gag Reel"" that is a slightly amusing collection of blown lines as the cast try hard to keep a straight face during certain scenes.

Finally, there is the obligatory theatrical trailer.

This is a movie that could have been so easy to screw up. It's amazing that all involved did such a good job. They've created an entertaining and funny movie that pays homage to the classic TV series and yet also stands on its own. This is an excellent example of how to remake a TV show the right way.",1091404800,2,2476,4.712962962962963
2062443,4,B00024JC3U,"""Starsky & Hutch"" exceeds expectations, which you have to admit have been lowered considerably when it comes to all of the movies that have been made recycling old television shows. This is perhaps to be expected when you understand that the target audience for these films consists of people who have probably never seen an episode of ""I Spy"" or ""The Mod Squad,"" and who are would be more familiar with the famous poster of Farrah Fawcett than any single episode of ""Charlie's Angels."" But this 2004 comedy has two advantages.

 First, there is a rich tradition of buddy films where a ""good"" person and a ""bad"" person team up and overcome their differences to work together, extending back from Riggs & Murtaugh to Butch & Sundance, all the way back to Katie Scarlet & Miss Melly. ""Starsky"" and ""Hutch"" plays with this tried and true formula, mainly by tweaking it, but the key thing is that the film embraces the idea at the same time it is lampooning it. This is, all things considered, a gentle comedy telling the story of how Starksy and Hutch came to meet, even with Snoop Dogg bringing something of an edge to Huggy Bear.

 Second, there is pretty good chemistry between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch; they should since this is their sixth film together. In fact, this is the most chemistry Stiller has shown with anybody in one of his films since he worked with DeNiro. Stiller is helped by the fact that his Starsky tends to go over the top but still manages to get the job done. You keep thinking he is about to make a fool of himself, and he certainly moves in that direction, but things never get so far out of hand that he becomes just a big joke.

 The big joke in the film would be the plan of bad guy Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn) who has invented a former of cocaine that has even German shepherds cannot detect. In other words, Feldman has invented (wait for it) ""new Coke."" But the plot is merely an excuse for Stiller and Wilson to do scenes together and it the spirit of true partnership each gets humiliated in turn, such as when a jailhouse snitch (Will Ferrell) makes Hutch show his belly button (then things get really weird), and then they get humiliated together. It is not like we do not know that in the end Feldman is going down, because he is going down hard, man, so the plot is not the point. Furthermore, the supporting case of Juliette Lewis, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra, and Fred Williamson as Captain Dobey is pretty good for this sort of film.

 Plus, you have Starsky's beloved bright-red supercharged Ford Gran Torino, which he drives like a crazy person and then becomes incensed by the thought it might get scratched or dented. The homage to the original consists of the requisite appearance by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, as well as Wilson warbling Soul's one hit, ""Don't Give Up on Us Baby,"" a joke that is going to be lost on most of the viewers. Actually, throughout the film director Todd Phillips makes great use of the music of that period, such as ""We've Only Just Begun"" and ""Afternoon Delight,"" to add a ironic counterpoint to the proceedings.",1091404800,4,3119,4.537366548042705
2062444,4,B00024JC3U,"If you are expecting a send-up of the classic 1970's cop-show with side-splitting humor, that's not what you're gonna get. Instead, this movie remake of Starsky and Hutch places the emphasis on action and, as such, is more of an action flick than a comedy. Although this might not be what you'd expect from a movie with Stiller and Wilson, an excellent storyline and well-developed characters make this movie a real pleasure to watch.

 The storyline involves the two detectives on the case of a drug-dealer who has a formula that makes cocaine undetectable. This particular concept is thoughtful and highly original. Starsky (Stller) and Hutch (Wilson) rely on underworld connection, Huggy Bear (played gracefully by Snoop Dogg) and detective work to put the pieces together. And, while a lot of the detective work is silly, it won't have you rolling on the floor like some of Stiller and Wilson's previous outings.

 I would point out, however, that if you are a Starsky and Hutch ""purist"" (if there is such a thing?) that quite a few liberties were taken with some characters. First off, while the Dogg plays Huggy Bear as some kind of underworld kingpin, I remember the original Huggy Bear as being more of a street-urchin. Kind of a low-class hustler. Also, I remember the original Hutch (David Soul), as being more sullen and brooding as opposed to the laid-back way that Wilson plays Hutch.

 These liberties taken with the characters still do not detract from the movie in any way. The only original character that is true to form is Doby, who would always chew-out Starsky and Hutch for unorthodox police work.

 There is plenty action here, which is the movie's strongsuit. Firefights, carchases and undercover work add excitement to the mix. Ultimatley, the movie is highly enjoyable. At one point, Starsky even tries to ""land"" the famous red Gran Torino on a yacht (don't ask).

 I would, however, point out that the Anal-Retentive Cop and the laid-back partner is not 100% original. The same plan was used in the 1980's remake of Dragnet featuring Tom Hanks and Dan Ackroyd. For that I would deduct a half-star. Another half-star is taken away from the general lack of focus on the 1970's settings. I really can't explain this, except by saying that some movies (ie: Boogie Nights) genuinely make you ""feel"" like you're back in the 70's. Just like the ""Doors"" made you feel like you were in the 60's. Anyway, I digress. An enjoyable, if not lampoonish movie. 4 stars.",1091318400,,2480,4.84160756501182

Their chemistry makes this movie as fun as it is with their great timing and fun outlook at the material they have. They were great together in zoolander, and they tear it up again in this film. Snoop Dogg is great as Huggy Bear and does steal the movie a little with his performance, and Vince Vaughn is great as the typical retro 70's villain with mustache in tow. The Direction by Todd Phillips stays in line with the flashy style that made that bygone time such a memorable one, and the look of the film stays with the tone that was the bench mark of the series.

The details of the 70s were paid close attention to in the film and the plot was consistent with the type of series this was.  One of the stars of the movie was the Ford Grand Torino and its appearance was almost personified into a cast-list deserving role.

'Starsky and Hutch' does have some really funny moments. But to say that the entire movie is filled with wit and puns like other Stiller movies is untrue. I found some parts boring and just plain dumb.

2062454,3,B00024JC3U,"I think the best word for ""Starsky and Hutch"" is 'serviceable'. It's reasonably funny, decently acted and directed, and, all and all, an entertaining way to spend an evening. It's neither the best nor the worst work the team of Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have done. [This is their sixth movie together.] One doesn't have to have any knowledge of the ancient TV series it is based on to enjoy it.

Starsky [Stiller] and Hutch [Wilson] are two renegade cops who belong together. When first made partners, they don't much like each other, but, after awhile, they begin to care for each other in a classic 'male bonding' way. Their first big case involves a drug dealer [Vince Vaughn], who has figured out a novel way to smuggle and transport cocaine. As is always true in movies like this, they are stymied by the 'system' in pursuing their man, but they figure out 'novel' ways to overcome this problem. [Their 'novel' ways would land them in jail in real life!]

The moviemakers wisely chose to make ""Starsky and Hutch"" a satire of the 70s rather than a replication of the TV show - a show most people only vaguely remember anyway.

Some of the gags work, while others fall flat. Stiller and Wilson are always a pleasure to watch working together. Sometimes it's funny just to see them TRY so hard when a sketch is weak.",1090627200,,1320,4.561181434599156
2062455,5,B00024JC3U,"Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are two of the funniest actors around these days, and they're even funnier when they're teamed up. Starsky and Hutch puts them in the roles of two drastically different cops chosen to work together. This approach may seem overdone, but Stiller and Wilson keep the screen fresh. They are both incredible actors and comedians; it would be hard to watch this film without laughing out loud.

Owen Wilson is Hutch, a laid back cop that likes to bend the rules. He never gets any work done and even drinks on the job. Starsky is the exact opposite. He is uptight and follows the rules to the book. You wouldn't guess, but he's also one hell of a driver. His car of choice is a red Grand Torino, and man can he make it fly. However, both Starsky and Hutch are outcastes at the police office, so they are put together. Naturally, the two characters hate each other when first paired up.

They soon get on the case of some drug dealers who are trying to get a new genetically engineered type of cocaine onto the streets. Vince Vaughn does an incredible job as the ringleader of this operation. He is serious and sinister in a way that just makes you laugh.

And then there is the infamous Huggy Bear. I've never seen the television series so I have no idea what he's supposed to be like, but Snoop Dogg is hilarious. Huggy Bear calls himself an urban informer. Basically he tells Hutch what the word on the street is so Hutch won't go and bust him. I think Snoop Dogg did a great job acting this part because he really didn't have to act. Huggy Bear wears lots of bling, talks slowly in a mellow voice, and knows a lot about drugs. Just like Snoop Dogg.

One of my favorite scenes pits Starsky against Dancing Rick in a disco dance off. It sounds cheesy, and it is. They pull off some really cool and original moves that'll have you splitting your sides with laughter. Another one of my favorite clips involves Starsky playing Russian Roulette while interrogating a suspect. In fact, just about every scene in the movie made me laugh. That's when you know you have a high quality comedy.

There are no bad characters in this film. Carmen Electra and Amy Smart play some sizzling love interests. Huggy Bear's crew is even worth a few chuckles. Will Ferrell has perhaps the funniest part in the film. The only downside to Starsky and Hutch is that it comes up a little short on the action side. This isn't a real problem because whatever the film lacks in action it makes up for in comedy twofold. Starsky and Hutch will have you rolling on the ground with laughter.",1090540800,13,2584,4.454545454545454
2062456,4,B00024JC3U,"MOVIE: After seing the dissapointments that were Dodgeball and Anchorman I decided to give Ben Stiller and the gang one more chance. Boy am I glad I did. This movie was a truly funny movie that did not force the audience to laugh by doing crazy things. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson really clicked in this movie and that really helped the experience. The movie is not a parody, it's not making fun of the 70's like Anchorman is. This is just a funny spin on a classic tv show, and sure you'll find a little spoof on things here and there.. It's not as over the top as Zoolander, which was a very vivid parody on the modeling world. This was a good comedy that I really enjoyed. I really hate comparing it to Dodgeball and Anchorman but I have to because all the cast members are in each of these movies except for Owen Wilson. I actually found Will Ferrel funnier in here than I did in Anchorman. Never will this movie force you to laugh nor will it have crazy things that have no reference whatsoever. So, if you need to wash that bad taste of Dodgeball and Anchorman out of your mouth then this is the movie to do it with. Great to own, a must to rent.

  VIDEO: The video turned out great for this kind of movie. There are a lot of bright colors in this movie and every thing was sharp and crisp. Ususally red is a nightmare for movies because it blurs very easily, but Starsky's car was so very shiny on my HDTV.

  AUDIO: The standard 5.1 mix does the job, and actually will surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine.

  PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Oh my! Another single disc release from Warner in an Armary case. Maybe they got rid of those cheap snapper cases for good, but there is no insert. The extras are a bit wimpy as well. You have a commentary by the director, a funny take on making of documentaries, a look at Snoop Dog's character, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a trailer. You will breeze through these in one day. Thankfully the movie was enjoyable.

This movie is right along the same lines as something like Joe Dirt - it's something to watch when you have nothing else to watch.  Also, the retro 70's thing is getting a little old.",1090195200,,255,4.163265306122449
2062463,3,B00024JC3U,"The movie was boring in the beginning, then it started getting funny in the middle to the end of it.
Snoop! Stick to rapping, this has got to be the worst acting ever made from the Doggfather. What's with the golf clothes?
Next thing you'll hear his latest album called Snoop Golfy Dogg and latest single, ""Ima Give Ya A Hole In One b33ach!""
Sorry pony lovers, you don't want to watch this movie, if you can't stand a pony getting blasted by a bunch of bullets.
Props to Owen Wilson! You da man! Carmen Electra and that one blonde chick from Roadtrip-You should've made it to be Paris Hilton & Carmen instead.
Overall, it will leave with you a few laughs.",1089763200,,655,4.377049180327869
2062464,4,B00024JC3U,"When I was dragged to the theatre to see ""Starsky and Hutch"" with a few friends of mine, I expected the worst.  I was sure I would be rolling my eyes and cringing throughout the whole movie.  Well, I would find myself cringing a few times (simply from a few scenes of embarrasing humor), but would only roll my eyes once, the ending.  Now, normally if a movie has a bad ending, I'd slam it, because the end of a movie normally makes or breaks a film, but not in S&H's case, this is actually a very enjoyable, good humoured, and even at times uproarious comedy.
There is one scene in this movie that for me, goes down in the history books for one of the funniest comedic sequences of all time. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson come barging in an apartment to catch a sniper.  The apartment is occupied by an older man and his son.  They grab the father as the kid does cartwheels and flips out of the room and behind the kitchen counter.  From there, knives come flying out from behind the counter, wreaking havoc in the room and as Wilson and Stiller try to dodge the flying cutlery, the father eggs his son on, speaking in Chinese (I think) telling him to throw more of what and when.  It brought tears to my eyes.
The first half of this movie, though distinctly slap-stick, is generally enjoyable and even funny at times, however, the nearer you get to the end of the movie the worse things become.  As usual, in the ridiculously goofy action/comedy flicks that Hollywood makes, there's an amazingly overblown finale that is not fun, interesting, realistic, funny, and without any of those qualities, it fails miserably short of being enjoyable.  Oh well, it could have been worse.  It could have been much worse.  This movie had the potential to be genuinely painful to sit through, but amazingly, I found myself having fun and getting the first decent laugh I'd had in a long time.
SUMMARY
This movie is really worthy of ***1/2 stars, but I've given it the benefit of the doubt with four stars, because in all honesty and against every ounce of my better judgement, I like this movie!  I don't normally like slap-stick humor of any kind, and I'm not an Owen Wilson fan either, but ""Starsky and Hutch"" managed to make itself fun for even me, so, I suppose that's the sign of at least a decent movie.",1089676800,2,2297,4.455847255369928
2062465,5,B00024JC3U,"Please listen to me this is a very funny and it is as funny (well almost as funny) as There's Something About Mary.  I guarntee it will have you laughing so hard that you'll fall out of your seat or you can complain to me by writing your review that's against me, but I know you will not do that.  Now don't think I just like this movie because, yes, it had a scene where Amy Smart and Carmen Electra made out and, yes, that did win an MTV Movie Award for best kiss.  I'm telling you go out and see this movie and thank me later (not for that scene that won an MTV Movie Award), but for the super funny jokes and the laughs you'll be making during the movie.  If you don't believe me, check what the critics said.  If you watched the television series back when it was on, even better.

2062468,5,B00024JC3U,"This movie was outright hilarious! Most people who slammed this movie don't know anything about comedy. If you liked any other films by Stiller and Wilson, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE! I thought the story line was perfect, because it allowed the insertion of hilarious offshoots and parts that were not necessary in the overall outcome of the plot. Great cameos by WILL FERRELL and the old Starsky and Hutch from the TV Show. Oh, also, most people who reviewed this also cared if it matched the authenticity of the TV Show. WHO CARES????  I honestly thought it was and still is, the funniest movie of 2004!",1087603200,,601,4.616822429906542
2062469,1,B00024JC3U,"...of time, talent and money.  This could have been such a funny movie, but they really blew it. As a fan of the original series I thought that this ""remake"", or ""re-interpretation"" if you will, had the potential for some serious laughs - even if they had played it straight. Boy, was I ever disappointed.  A big part of the old series was the chemistry between the two stars - Stiller and Wilson just have none.  They were both too busy trying to be individually funny - and failing.  The only bright spot in the movie was Snoop Dog's portrayal of Huggy-Bear, performed with his tongue planted firmly in cheek.  Julianne Lewis was completely wasted in her throw away role as the brainless mistress of Vince Vaughn's equally one-dimensional thug.  All in all - hardly worth your time.  Thank goodness I saw it for free on an airplane.",1087171200,3,834,4.594594594594595
