8658722,5,B00KH57UHE,"I have never seen Ella the Elephant before but animals are my absolute favorite animal so I was excited to see a show starring one. My kids have all inherited my love of elephants so they love Ella. In fact, this got a squeal out of Paige when she saw it and she immediately opened it and watched it.

My Kids

I have a six year old boy and a five year old girl and my original impression of this show was that it might be too young for them. However, they both adore it! This is one of those wonderful DVD's that you put on and you don't hear another peep from your kids until it's over. I sat to watch with them since I'd never seen it before and I like to know what my kids are watching.

My Impressions

I love Ella's fun and kind personality and the emphasis on friendship. My kids are at that age where friendships are becoming more important and so is choosing the right ones. This is a great example of friendship, what it should look like and what kind of friend you should be.

I also love how imagination is used and encouraged. Kids have such vivid imaginations and the straight laced shows that don't utilize them are just a shame! I want my kids to dream and imagine as it's a cherished part of childhood. My kids love Ella's magical red hat and have already asked me to get them one! Paige said she wants it to help her solve HER problems.

 The Imagery

I love Ella and friends the backgrounds with wonderful colors. My eight month old doesn't watch TV yet but he stops to look when this show is on because of the colors.

Featured Episodes:

Ellas Got Talent/Safety First
Trunk Trooper/Ella in Charge
Girls Club/Soapbox Squabble
Treasure Hunters/Ella Borrows Trouble
Ella Bakes a Cake/Camp Ella
Ella on the Ball/Up, Up and Away
Tea Party Trouble/Home Again
Ellas Carnival/Monkey Business

Favorite Episode

When I asked Paige what her favorite episode was, I already knew her answer would be 'Tea Party Trouble' because she's really into Tea Parties right now. Reed said he likes them all the same.

My Conclusion

Ella the Elephant encourages positivity in children and all the things we want our kids to emulate in friendship and problem solving. It's a great, wholesome show for the whole family!",1410825600,2,2216,4.480099502487562
