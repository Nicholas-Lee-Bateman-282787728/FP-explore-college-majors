7505424,2,B017HP18LA,"I LOVED the first season.  It was a 5 star show at that point.  Season 2 was just OK.  It was exciting enough but a lot of the humor was gone from the lead characters banter, and they upped the gore and violence factor ten fold.  I felt like they suddenly thought they had to be more like TWD or Game Of Thrones and try to shock you with deeply disturbing and freakish plotlines more and more often rather than keep the focus on Da Vinci's genius which was why I was watching it in the first place.  Plus the killing off of popular characters begins in season 2 and continues into season 3.  I was incredibly disappointed in the 3rd season.  It felt like a bunch of nonsense and the overall feel of the show became completely depressing with way too much hallucinating during several early episodes.  It became garbled nonsense by the 4th episode.  I fully understand why it likely lost viewers and did not return.  I was totally stunned at how far it fell from season 1.  When given an opportunity like this it always amazes me that the show runners cannot find decent writers who can a keep a show interesting and enjoyable for at least 5 seasons.  What a shame.",1483747200,,1164,4.362790697674418
7505425,5,B017HP18LA,Thank you.,1483488000,,10,4.5
7505426,3,B017HP18LA,"Season 3 wraps up the series well enough, but ultimately was the least spectacular and adventurous of the series.  It was as expertly crafted as we'd come to expect of the series, just not as engaging as previous seasons - more compulsory than inspired, without anything truly new or fresh.  A rather melodramatic punctuation of a greatly imaginative series, short on revelations or the creative awe that permeated the shows mythology so well.  I can only assume the writers weren't ready to end it.  If that's the case they pulled it out admirably.  But, I hoped for more considering the first two seasons' design.",1483315200,,615,4.875

7505431,5,B017HP18LA,Really a great take on what DaVinci's youth entailed. Nicely developed characters and references to DaVinci's creations and endeavors. Especially enjoyed the introductory graphic images. Very nice.,1477440000,,197,6.333333333333333
7505432,5,B017HP18LA,"This really was one of the best shows on television. It was so smart...so epic. However, I did feel that, even though the ending was neat, all the mysteries didn't build up to a completely satisfying climax. It was the best of J.J. Abrams type conceptual television, mixed with the best of historical drama, crossed with the best of Indiana Jones. The best reveals on this show were totally breathtaking (the mechanical head speaking in the voice of Leo's mother; Leonardo's deduction that the Earth is round...), and Da Vinci's solution to win the war in the end was B A D a s s.

I was naive to think (and hope) this show would go on for 5 seasons or more, but truly I didn't think it would be over after just three. Quality on TV unfortunately has almost nothing to do with a show's longevity. Considering how short the seasons were, the show plays almost like an extended miniseries, and I'm not sure that any episodes drew more than a million viewers. That leaves a lot of people who have yet to discover this brilliant show--I really envy them.",1475971200,,1050,4.49738219895288

7505438,4,B017HP18LA,"Really enjoyed this season! When I first watched this show, I fell in love with all the characters. Flaws and all, it's what made them human. They trimmed out this HUGE quest and made it a bit simpler. Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of action and adventure! What I mean by simple is they focused a bit more on the characters and what they were going through. As much as I enjoyed the quest Leonardo and his friends went on for The Book of Leaves in season 2, I felt that the characters got a bit lost. Each going on these huge missions and quests that took up so much of their lives and, as a result, character development was not as prevalent. (Not gone, mind you, just not as prominent.) After all of the characters being spread out all over, it was really nice to see them bring it all back. They focused more on the relationships in the show. The bonds of friendship and love, the core of who these people are, and how they fight to survive and save each other. Honestly, one of my favorite seasons!

Must be noted that I am just BLOWN AWAY by the phenomenal talent and skill of all the actors in this show. (In particular, Mr. Tom Riley and Blake Ritson, who had some of the best scenes this season I think. Both separately and together.)",1473552000,2,1253,4.286919831223629

7505448,1,B017HP18LA,"This might be the worst television I have ever seen. Period. If I could give it zero stars I would. The first season was interesting and promising. The second season started going off the rails, and Season Three is a massive train wreck. The plot lurches from one bit of absurdity to another, often with no relationship between the plot points, rather like the actors who often are either screaming at the tops of their voices (so that views can't understand what they are saying) or whispering so ""intimately"" that we can't understand what they're saying. Did no one tell the actors that it doesn't matter how ""dramatically"" they flail around, if the audience can't decipher their words they're failures? I know this series is not based on reality, but apparently no one told the writers or directors that even the most ""out there"" fantasy/science fiction story has to be true to its own world or universe. I'm guessing no one thought about the audience and ever looked at a storyline or a filmed scene from the point of view of someone who had not been at the alcohol/drug-soaked lunch where this was all concocted. A total waste. Whoever at Starz approved this mess ought to lose his/her job.",1468108800,,1195,4.722488038277512
7505449,5,B017HP18LA,"I recently received season 3 of Da Vinci's Demons.  Before watching it I went back to the beginning and revisited the
earlier seasons.  I am so sorry there will not be a season 4 for some time, if ever.  I found this show to be so innovative
and the dialog so brilliant.  I also believe it has some of the finest acting on TV.  I really learned a lot about the history and
politics of the time as well as the scientific breakthroughs that were happening.
Thank you David S. Goyer for your creative concept and brilliant character development as well as all the excellent actors,
writers and directors who have brought these stories so beautifully to life.  Thanks, Bear, for the wonderful music.  Many fans will
 be hoping for your return.",1467936000,,739,4.545454545454546

7505455,1,B017HP18LA,"I loved the first two series.  They were charming and cleverly written.  They depicted life in Florence during middle ages, politics in Vatican and conspiracies between the Italian states.  But, this one was a total failure in my opinion.  I would rate it zero if there were an option!  The whole series was totally inaccurate from historical facts.  A mixture of little fiction and facts is acceptable, and even enticing; but, a total departure from what has really happened is not!  Pope's daughter did not kill prince Beyazid.  He died from overdose of wine.  Alfonso did not die in battle to defend Otranto.  Even an army was raised by King Ferdinand of Naples to recapture Otranto (Alfonso led the forces) in 1481, Turkish forces negotiated truce with Italians because of the untimely death of Mehmed II, and withdrew to Albania.  The contingent forces were not supplied by Vlad Dracul but by Mathias Corvinus, king of Hungary.  Leonardo had different ideas in making war engines but none was truly implemented.  The series shows that he invented the tank, the bazooka and some sort of laser powered up from lightning that wiped out half of the Ottoman forces.  At that point, I just started laughing.  Because of the faulty language and the degrading stance against Turks, I think the writer of this series must be a true hater of the Turks.",1463961600,,1347,4.820960698689956
7505456,1,B017HP18LA,"Love the series, Hated the DVD as it was not for USA devices.  I looked at the packaging and it does not state anywhere that it is for Region 2.

7505457,5,B017HP18LA,"The third season continued this amazing series. Yes there is violence, controversy and lots of imagination in the making of the program, but when all is said it is great to have a show which you can never out guess what is going to happen. The fight between the different States of Italy, the Catholic church and the invading forces of the Turkish Sultan takes on a almost surreal aspect when Vlad the Impaler is involved. A true mix of fiction and fact is used very well indeed. By the way the last episode is ended you could not really tell if the series is over. I hope it is not.",1463097600,4,583,4.261261261261262
