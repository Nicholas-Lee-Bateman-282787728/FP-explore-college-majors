1190514,1,B0000063YG,Horrible.  I watched it once and donated the tape to the local library.  This tape does not rate a star it rates a negative five star.,996796800,,134,4.115384615384615
1190515,1,B0000063YG,"I purchased this video for a company-related film project on Napoleon, and it is *hideous* to look at -- the tape actually contains a warning, at the  outset, which states that the images in the reproduction ""may be  unclear."" It basically looks like a bootleg.. like someone took a  video camera and filmed a movie screen in a repertory house. In addition,  the tape is dubbed in English -- presumably from French -- but you'll never  learn this from reading the box. As for the original film -- who knows? It  looks much too stagy and more than a little mind-numbing, but considering  the quality of the actors who are involved (inc. Orson Welles, Yves  Montand, Danielle Darrieux, and Daniel Gelin) it could be a lost gem. Given  the picture and sound quality, it's impossible to tell. I'd never heard of  this film before I began my research on Napoleon; there's a reason for  that. Avoid this tape at all costs, and stick to Abel Gance's (restored)  silent classic, if you're interested in Napoleon -- it's spectacular.",967680000,4,1024,4.72316384180791
7903647,1,B0000063YG,Bad print.  Color and sound need work.  Impossible to evaluate the film without seeing and hearing a better print.,1516924800,,114,4.947368421052632
7903648,1,B0000063YG,The sound is wretched. It is as if there were dust on the sound pick-ups when it was transferred from film to digital.,1509840000,,118,4.173913043478261
7903649,5,B0000063YG,Excellent,1417132800,,9,9.0
7903650,1,B0000063YG,"I bought this because Yves Montand has a part in it, even though I knew it was the made-for-America version of the film and had poor reviews. The reviews were right. The picture is often fuzzy and the color garish, which I could live with, but because the English is dubbed, one cannot hear the real actors' voices, in English or in French. Sadly, it was difficult to tell which actor was Montand. But I still would love to see the authentic, uncut French version, preferably, with English subtitles.",1402358400,,500,4.629213483146067
7903651,2,B0000063YG,"Evaluation of Napoleon (15 5) (VHS)

My copy had numerous gaps in the first scenes.  The story was more concerned with Napoleon's love life than his foreign and domestic policies and accomplishments.  I would not recommend it at any price.",1384819200,,239,4.925
7903652,4,B0000063YG,"Sacha Guitry has been celebrated by a recent Criterion Eclipse set, and yet this Public Domain bio-pic has not quite gotten much attention. Yes, it's dubbed in English, and yes, the print is a bit dodgy. Still, it has Guitry's trademark wit, energy and sense of fun. Driven by a flashback structure with heavy narration, you get Napoleon's basic story delivered with plenty of costumes and dramatic flourishes. After the watching the entirety of the Criterion set, however, I was willing to find a replacement for a declining VHS copy of Napoleon. This Aussie DVD
copy seems to be the only one available. As it is, it's certainly suitable until somebody cleans up the original French language version. Even at $25.00, it's worth it, as I'll watch this again and again.",1364083200,3,768,4.870229007633588
7903653,4,B0000063YG,"I was delightfully suprised to find this a very interesting movie. Whether completely historically correct I couldn't say.  The video is, of course, a remaster of the 1956 film. Sometimes the color seems faded for this reason.  I recommend this movie for its educational value to parents, teachers, and homeschoolers. It gives a visual picture of prominent historical events.  I also recommend this movie for its entertainment value.",1190505600,,433,5.338235294117647
7903654,1,B0000063YG,"Il s'agit d'une version  peine lgale de la version anglo-amricaine (et noir et blanc) du superbe film couleur et en franais de Sacha Guitry de 1954. La compagnie ihffilm.com, qui se spcialise dans les films historiques, offre galement une version en anglais seulement de ce chef-d'oeuvre, mais elle est au moins en couleurs et la qualit visuelle est suprieure.  quand les films en franais pour francophones d'Amrique?  quand les versions Criterion restaures de ""Si Versailles m'tait cont"", ""Napolon"", ""Le Diable boiteux"", ""Le Destin fabuleux de Dsire Clary"", etc. (tous de Sacha Guitry). Note: Il existe une version RUSCICO du ""Destin fabuleux..."" en couleurs, en franais et en russe, mais en version PAL seulement. Il serait peut-tre temps de fonder les Amis de Sacha Guitry en Amrique...",1135987200,7,789,5.246031746031746
7903655,3,B0000063YG,Ce film sur la vie de Napolon est relativement bien fait. Sacha Guitry raconte la vie de Napolon en se mettant dans la peau du Prince de Talleyrand qui fut Ministre des affaires trangres de la France tant sous Napolon que sous Louis XVIII. Il est regrettable que la seule version disponible sur Amazon soit en anglais seulement et en noir et blanc alors que la version originale est en couleur et en franais. Le ton est un peu chauvin mais Napolon n'est-il pas un des plus grands franais? C'est un film intressant  voir.,1118707200,6,520,4.531914893617022
7903656,2,B0000063YG,"Excellent film, avec excellent acteurs et tr&egrave;s bon sc&eacute;nario. Dommage que l'on ne puisse pas avoir la version originale en Franais sur un DVD fait par des Franais....",1100044800,2,179,5.428571428571429
