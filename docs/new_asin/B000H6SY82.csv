2629272,5,B000H6SY82,"This DVD is a great companion to the first safe side DVD.  It portrays situations in which kids can be exposed to different online situations that are not appropriate, the creepy way those situations can make kids feel and the right thing to do to prevent and handle those situations.  My kids love the safe side super chick and all the lessons she teaches, it is serious with enough silliness and gets the point across loud and clear.  This DVD series keeps my kids attention because it describes real world situations but keeps a sense of humor going, too.  I couldn't be more pleased.",1210723200,,587,4.615384615384615
2629273,5,B000H6SY82,"Ok, I know you are wondering why I am bothering to review this dvd when there are 262 reviews?

Well, it's because out of the 262 reviews  & 27 pages of reviews there are MAYBE only 8 ACTUAL REVIEWS FOR INTERENT SAFETY REVIEWS.  So while looking at reviews other than the title for the review also look and see if it says ""This review from Stranger Safety DVD"", if it does the reviewer reviewed the stranger safety on the wrong dvd.

Any way, this DVD is geared for older children but my daughter who is 5yrs & 3 months understood how the Interent can be dangerous. Granted right now she only plays on Noggin, Nick Jr., Playhouse Disney and Webkinz she now knows not to click on pop ups and that there a people out there that might pretend to be a kid and they are not. I think this DVD is still very worth while and worth the money, it's a good place to start and will grow as your child grows with their computer skills and needs.

Your 8 year old and 'Tween will get a big of this dvd because there are some characters in this movie that will remind you of Napoleon Dynamite ( Super Chicks brother Danger Dude), her father Cautionary Dale who in one scean acts like Robin Williams did in the movie Birdcage and Super Chick does a "" Crocodile Hunter""  & Lizzy McGuire little skit and John Walsh has a small appearance in the Lizzy like skit and of course the Gorilla is back and Fang the dog! There is also a cartoon character called Clicky,  who was created by NetSmartz which is a division of The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

 Here is a list of what the dvd talks about

Cyber headquarters Hot Tip review

The information like the other Safe Side Dvd is well done and teaches in a way to make your child aware, but doesn't scare them silly. The DVD comes with free MP3 download for their COOL TUNES CD, which by the way is awesome companion for your car after watching STRANGER SAFETY, a small size poster on the 4 Hot Tips of this dvd ( it's actually the size of the inside information card to hang up next to the computer, and a cool Safet Side green rubber wrist band for 8 yr or tween's wrist. There is a section for parents that is locked and can only be accessed when you go online and get the code. This including two real-life short videos about Internet dangers introduced by John Walsh. I have not watched this yet. The code is 342. For more information you can go to their website [...] There is also Spanish subtitles, and wide screen or full screen format  and is 42 minutes in lenght. There is a mess up section, a music video - the song is not as cool sounding or as catchy as the songs from Cool Tunes which is for Stranger Safety, and a small song with Click.

The only thing that was different is that Safe Side Super Chick was just sorta missing something in her performance, at first I thought it was a different girl.... but nope it's the same girl. I don't know how to explain it... it's just missing something.  All and all a terrific dvd!",1188000000,,3294,4.319286871961102
2629274,4,B000H6SY82,"This dvd is informative and non-threatening. Our family really liked the other safety dvd better but safe-side super chick is her super self in this internet safety dvd as well. The other dvd is much more genuine and I'd highly recommend it.  This one is better for older kids due to the fact that they tried to dub characters such as Napoleon Dynamite and the Crocodile Hunter. This dvd is still ""S-W-E-E-T"" and gives kids practical ways to stay safe while using the computer such as never give out your personal information such as your name and address, etc. and never agree to meet anyone in person who you have chatted with online because they may not be who they say they are online and really could mean you harm. This dvd is fairly short and allows kids to hear this important stay safe information from someone other than just mom and dad.",1186876800,2,848,4.542483660130719
2629275,5,B000H6SY82,"I love these videos, the Safe Side Stranger Safety, and this one Internet Safety. I never wanted to terrify my kids to teach them the dangers of strangers (in person and on-line) - but I want them to be safe. These videos are the best of both worlds! They learn in a non-threatening way with a fun character called the Safeside SuperChick! They love it. And more importantly they are learning!",1185840000,,393,4.549295774647887
2629276,5,B000H6SY82,"I encourage families of pre-teens and teens to view this video.  It provides excellent tips on how pre-teens and teens can navigate through the internet safely.

2629277,5,B000H6SY82,I have an eight year old and a five year old.  This DVD was appropriate for both - but better for the second grader since they get on the internet at school.  It helped her realize that everything on the internet is not always what it seems to be.  It was presented in a manner that was informative without going over the top with scare tactics - so both kids watched.,1179100800,2,368,4.154929577464789
2629278,5,B000H6SY82,This DVD was bought for our company...and have already heard great reviews.  I recommend to others!,1168473600,,99,5.1875
2629279,5,B000H6SY82,I got this for my  8 yr old son - and he said he thought it was going to be boring.  We watched it together and discussed it afterward.  He loved it and asked if there were any more like it!  He also took it into school and shared it with his class.  He said everyone paid attention and thought it was neat.  It is entertaining enough to hold childrens' attention so that they understand the very important message that it is sending.,1168300800,,434,4.168674698795181
2629280,5,B000H6SY82,"I bought this dvd for my son and daughter, both computer users who are under 12. it's the first time they really seemed to underdstand how dangerous the Internetcan be -- and the video does a great job of showing that the 'kids' they're talking to might really be adults. best part is that my daughter liked it so much, she brought it to school to show to her computer teacher. highly recommended.",1160956800,6,397,4.4520547945205475
8137041,1,B000H6SY82,"sadly, I was unable to watch this movie at all.  It's encrypted with an ancient code.  I tried to contact the filmmakers repeatedly, but to no avail.  Besides, it's so old that any tips it may have had to offer would have been useless with today's technology.",1509840000,,259,4.468085106382978
8137042,5,B000H6SY82,now I'm even more scared of the internet  Lets just ban the internet from itself and put it in time out until it behaves,1461715200,,120,4.0
8137043,5,B000H6SY82,My granddaughter learned and retained a lot of information with regards to internet safety...taught in an interesting way that kids can relate to and love.,1418515200,,155,5.24
8137044,5,B000H6SY82,"I bought this for a Cub Scout lesson on Internet Safety. The boys laughed and had a fun time watching. We discussed the video afterwards, and the boys learned a great deal. Two thumbs up!",1388793600,,187,4.371428571428571
8137045,5,B000H6SY82,Bought several of these books for each of my children to share with their children and one to leave at my house. My kids play it often in the car where they have a captive audience.,1386720000,,181,4.055555555555555
8137046,5,B000H6SY82,"I love this, as well as the Safe Side DVD.  I'm going to share this with the school.  Even though it's a few years old, it's still current.",1385683200,,139,3.9285714285714284
8137047,5,B000H6SY82,"I cannot stress how important it is for us parents to make sure our children are educated about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace.  God bless John Walsh and Julie Clark for this and for their original Safe Side.  As a single mom, it really helps to have someone else reinforce your rules in a fun manner.  Every parent should watch this with their child.",1361577600,,356,4.446153846153846
8137048,5,B000H6SY82,My kids love the Safe Side videos! They were 3 & 5 when they first watched the Strangers Danger video and two years later they jumped at the chance to watch the internet safety video. The video is hilarious but at the same time the kids really learn about safety without scaring them. They ask to watch them over and over again.,1337731200,,328,4.306451612903226
8137049,4,B000H6SY82,"""The Safe Side -- Internet Safety"" is well done, easy for young children to understand.  I watched the video with my 6 and 9 year olds.  They don't play on the internet without my close supervision, but I want to be ready.  It's difficult to ingrain in them the importance of not sharing too much information.  I want them to know that just because someone asks, doesn't mean they have to answer.  Just because it's on a form, doesn't mean they have to fill it out.  This video explains the dangers without being graphic.

The issues discussed include email, pop-ups, revealing too much personal information, and meeting ""friends"" from the internet.  Of that last point, my children got the message loud and clear.  Good thing, it is the most important message of all.",1278028800,3,768,4.714285714285714
8137050,5,B000H6SY82,This is a great platform to start talking to your kids about internet safety.  The kids enjoyed it and learned alot at the same time.,1240272000,,133,4.32
