6142274,5,B00H9FDD2Q,Loved this show as a kid and now my son will be able to grow up knowing it.  He loves it and it is a genuinely good show not like the new garbage cartoons they have on tv these  days.,1417305600,2,183,3.55
6142275,5,B00H9FDD2Q,Take me back to a time when my biggest worry was oversleeping and missing one of my favorite Saturday morning cartoons. I love the theme song and the classic animation. Those were the days.,1416268800,10,189,4.588235294117647
6142276,5,B00H9FDD2Q,"Finally!!!! Gummi Bears is on DVD!

It should have been released with DuckTales, if not before then. Thankfully, Disney is releasing it.

Gummi Bears had superb writing and was the perfect show for a kid. I could never get over how sharp the animation was. This cartoon would be the vanguard for the Disney Afternoon. Before it played in the Disney Afternoon, it aired on Saturday mornings. It was always my number one goal to catch it at 10 or 11 AM. Gummi Bears held its own among other great hits of the 80s.

Lets hope they start DVD 1 with the very first episodes and don't mess it up like they did DuckTales. I think DuckTales and the others sold well enough for Disney to realize there is a market for their late 80s and early 90s cartoons. These years were the golden years for recent Disney animation. None of the new cartoons or any of the late 90s cartoons hold a candle to the Disney Afternoon originals.

I think Disney heard the consumers and made the right choice. If it sells, they'll probably release the whole series. Thanks Disney (or whoever in the Disney bureaucracy made this possible)!",1415836800,19,1108,4.525

6142279,4,B00H9FDD2Q,"Love the show... great for kids of all ages.  They translation to DVD wasn't the best.  The images are a little fuzzy on my Samsung LED, thus the 4-star rating.  But, for most kids, picture quality isn't their highest priority.  Besides, this classic has disappeared from pretty much anywhere except the DVDs, so it was still worth it to me!",1408579200,7,341,4.633333333333334

6142285,3,B00H9FDD2Q,There nothing wrong with the dvd really at all there just missing all the episode of the Gummy Bears. Its more or less like the Gargoyles DVDs They don't release the real season finale. I say this because there are episode where they meet other Gummy bears and there leader is a women and they don't trust humans and its not like an episode with the city that appears and vanishes. In Gargoyles it ends with the Gargoyles saving humasn on a train and seen as heroes not monsters,1515974400,,478,4.382022471910112
6142286,5,B00H9FDD2Q,1984 is the year I was born.... I flipping love the Gummy Bears..... and my kids 4& 6 love them too !!! Cant go wrong with old school cartoons....,1514592000,,146,4.068965517241379

Sunni - take a look at her first interaction with the princess and tell me that bear isn't a lesbian.

Great show, pity they never released the rest.",1511568000,,252,4.5777777777777775
6142289,5,B00H9FDD2Q,"I love this show! Brought back all the memories I had watching as a kid. Even though seasons 4-6 aren't available for sale - you can stream them on KODI tv with Exodus add-on. It was awesome to see ""King Igthorn"" parts 1 and 2 which were the original final episodes of the series.",1507334400,,280,4.203703703703703
6142290,5,B00H9FDD2Q,"The Gummi Bears, alongside the Wuzzles, were the first Disneytoon series made for TV, way back in 1985! Sadly, the Wuzzles never went past 1 season and 13 shows and NEVER on DVD. However, the Gummi Bears went on to have 65 shows in 6 seasons from 1985 to '91! The first 3 seasons are in this 3-disc DVD set, which had 29 half-hour shows altogether, that's more than any of the other classic Disneytoon TV show DVD sets to date! Among the popular voices in this series are the recently-dearly-departed June Foray (the gone-but-not-forgotten queen of voice acting), and Bill Scott (who passed away during the early years of the show, who played Bullwinkle), Lorenzo Music (the #1 voice of Garfield), Paul Winchell (the original voice of Tigger), Jim Cummings (who went on to play Pooh and Tigger from this show's early years to the present day), and many more! Believe it or not, the Gummi Bears and the Wuzzles revolutionized TV animation for the better, by being the first entirely-for-TV cartoon series to use full animation on a regular basis, if not all the time! The Gummi Bears also had a hand in one of the Rugrats' spoofed made-up series, the other hand being the Care Bears, making them the Dummi Bears; just as Cynthia was based from Barbie, Goober the Gopher from Barney the dinosaur, and Reptar from Godzilla AND Mickey Mouse! The Gummi Bears also debuted the same year as the Black Cauldron in theatres, hence the Middle Ages theme of both these things, yet the Black Cauldron remains one of 5 of Disney's major animated features never on Blu-ray in the USA to this day. And it don't look as if the Gummi Bears will ever conclude on DVD, along with many other classic Disneytoon series on DVD, so just be thankful for what you have, if you'll pardon my sounding like a nag by now. If you grew up with the Gummi Bears, or the Care Bears (or the Dummi Bears), you won't be sorry with this little giant collection of Gummi-juice-induced butt-kicking and heroism!",1506470400,3,1971,4.618233618233618

6142305,5,B00H9FDD2Q,"This is a review where I have to entirely represent the opinions of other members of our household.  First, the product did come with all the enclosed discs, and there haven't been any issues with discs not playing or any other quality control issue.  My husband used to watch this show when he was growing up, and he's taken to making his own Saturday Morning Cartoons program to spend time with our daughter, and this was one of the things he wanted to watch to share with her.  I did watch an episode with them, and it was pretty cute how super excited they were.  And then my husband turned to me, and said ""Did you like it?...Oh, well, maybe this isn't mama's thing.""  He could totally tell from my lack of expression as I was trying to come up with something neutral and tactful to say.  Now if he'd purchased Thundercats or He-Man?  I'd probably have been more on board with that ;)  Anyways, this is probably one of those things you're mostly interested in if you are either a Disney enthusiast in general, or if you have fond memories of watching this as a child.  There didn't seem to be any content that wasn't age appropriate for our daughter, who is 10, or for my husband, who just turned 40.  And they both are loving these. So I guess it can be good for some kids of all ages -just not this one ;)  It also I think was a decent value for 3 seasons worth at the price we paid.",1491177600,2,1390,4.247148288973384

The show is great for all ages and I honestly like it too.  (And I'm 33 years old.)  The stories have good lessons, the characters are likable, and the show has humor to it.

I love to let my young children experience the wonderful cartoons I had as a child.  I will say, because the graphics aren't as bright and digitized as today's cartoons are, it sometimes takes some sneaky trickery to get my kids (especially 6 year old boy) to want to watch this cartoon.  I usually put it on when they aren't in the room, and then they slowly get engaged as they notice it is on.
