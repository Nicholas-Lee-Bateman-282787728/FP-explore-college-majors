3535634,4,B001DPHD92,"In the past year, there have been a number of fiction films released all of which attempt to dramatize various aspects of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these films were well made, and share common themes. But they also have something else in common. They all flopped and failed to ignite the public moving them to action.

Now, the well-known documentarian Errol Morris (""Mr. Death"", ""The Thin Blue Line"", ""The Fog of War"") turns his eye to one small part of the current conflict, Abu Ghraib.

Morris, like Michael Moore, is an unconventional documentarian. Both almost overtly inject themselves, their thoughts and views into their exploration of the subject matter. And both are usually criticized for this practice. Every good documentary displays the filmmaker's strong point of view. This is why the film is made in the first place, someone wants to share their view on a topic, the filmmaker was interested, disturbed, concerned about something. Moore has been criticized because he has taken on politically charged ideas. Morris is now turning his eye on politically themed ideas and is receiving similar criticism. In my mind, even when their films are flawed, they are interesting and meaningful because the directors are passionate about their point of view. Why would you want to see a documentary without a strong point of view? Such a film would be boring and pointless.

I would find it hard to believe that you haven't seen at least one picture to come out of this prison in Iraq, a prison the American forces took over and converted into an interrogation facility for the prisoners they were also holding there. As soon as the story broke, some of the pictures were shown on every news show and cable network ad nausea until the next big story broke.

And, as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.

In ""Standard Operating Procedure"", Morris tries to give us a better view of the circumstances leading up to these events and to describe, in greater detail, what happened and why.

He does a remarkably good job creating a powerful, moving documentary.

The film begins with a brief explanation of what Abu Ghraib was - Saddam's prison before he was overthrown, a place he used to kill many of his political prisoners - and quickly moves into interviews with the main people involved in the event. As he talks to many of the service people who were stationed there, working there, we begin to get a picture of their living conditions. Upon their arrival, they moved into cells once used to house people who were subsequently killed, cells much like the cells of the prisoners they were there to watch.

As you watch the interviews, with subjects who have since served some time in prison, the trademarks of an Errol Morris film quickly become apparent. Morris has a unique interview technique, and a unique interview device, the Interrotron, a camera he developed for his own use. In many documentaries, the subject is looking at the interviewer to the side of the camera. As their talk is filmed, we watch the subject look to the side of the camera. They are looking away from us. The Interrotron reflects Morris, who is actually in another room, into the camera directly where the lens is. As he interviews a subject, the subject looks at his image in the camera, causing them to look directly at the lens. As they speak, and address his questions, they are looking and speaking directly to us. This makes the stories the subjects tell much more immediate and interesting.

One thing you may not have asked yourself is why did these soldiers take digital pictures of these moments of interrogation, torture and humiliation? They had to have realized they might fall into the wrong hands and become ammunition against them. Morris explores this question, allowing the subjects to talk about life at Abu Ghraib, their roles as caretakers of these prisoners, the quality of life they experienced while they were there. And why would they pose for photos, holding a thumbs up, smiling, laughing, documenting these moments, recording them for history.

A picture is worth a thousand words, but it can't say everything and Morris spends some time exploring both the photos and the quantity. Using unedited photos, he shows us what we missed as the soldiers attempted to cover up various things, before the government attempted to cover up the whole thing, and before the media created a firestorm around the whole affair. Morris also talks to an investigator hired by the government to make some sense of this mess and to determine what happened. As the investigator speaks, Morris shows us photos taken of the same event at precisely the same time, from two different cameras. Then, we see the other camera in each photo. Naturally, they have time stamps, so the investigator begins to build a timeline of specific events and goes through the photos to determine which of the offenses will the soldiers be tried for, what crimes have they committed, and which would be considered standard operating procedure?

As the subjects begin to tell the story, it becomes clear pretty quickly that one man, a sergeant, is at the center of the whole thing. He seems to be the instigator, encouraging his fellow soldiers to take pictures, to pose, to completely denigrate themselves and their prisoners. And they only seem to be too happy to do so, to follow the instructions and whims of this `leader'. He is also the only subject directly involved in this scandal Morris was unable to interview. The reason is explained at the end of the film, during the coda. But he certainly seems to have been the driving force behind the whole thing, manipulating his girlfriend, Lyndie England, the poster child for the scandal, to do things she says she wouldn't have other wise done. Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but the sheer number of people pointing their fingers at this man is compelling.

Using recreations and the sheer volume of photos, Morris helps to give us a more detailed look at what happened before and during the moments some of the more shocking photos were taken. He is trying to come to terms with what would lead these Americans to take pictures of themselves with prisoners who are piled naked on top of each other, naked and masturbating, dead and in body bags, and much more.

As I watched the film, an eerie similarity struck me. As more and more photos of the tortured and humiliated prisoners at Abu Ghraib were shown, I was reminded of the photos of the victims at Auschwitz, Bergen Belson and Dauchau made public to the world after these prison camps were liberated. Now, I understand some, many, of the detainees at Abu Ghraib were guilty of a crime, but the people who are charged with the livelihood of these criminals should rise above the behavior of their captors. If they don't, how are they any different from their prisoners?",1211155200,14,6886,4.810650887573964

3535636,5,B001DPHD92,"Reviewer ""From Hades"" spends 1,620 words supporting a thesis that can be stated in a sentence: The civilian interrogators were responsible for Abu Ghraib, and this film is flawed because it doesn't suggest that.

The reviewer makes clear that he believes the film spends too much time ""humanizing"" the military personnel when instead it should have been placing blame. He wanted the film to single out the civilian interrogators as the responsible persons so that, I guess, we can wipe our hands and move on.

It's distressing that his is the top-rated review because he is doing the precise thing that the film magnifies to absurdity: Telling the simple story, reaching the simple conclusion, identifying the ""bad guys,"" and being satisfied with your tidy little explanation.

It's easier to theorize about human behavior than it is to look at it.

It's easy to look at the photos from Abu Ghraib and construct stories. A social psychologist might say that Abu Ghraib illustrates the results of the Stanford Prison Experiment. An economist might say that ""rational"" people were responding to grim incentives. An evolutionary biologist might say that Abu Ghraib merely shows apes gone amok amid environmental pressures. A neurochemist might say that the military personnel were experiencing a severe chemical imbalance in the brain.

It's hard to do what Errol Morris did, which is to examine the events that actually happened and listen to the people involved. The result -- this movie -- shows how grossly inadequate simple stories can be.

Before watching Errol Morris's films, it's important to understand that he does not make traditional ""issue"" or ""historical"" documentaries like you might see on PBS. His purpose is not to document factual events, although that's part of it. Errol is after deeper truths--not just what happened, but why it happened, what it means, what it can tell us about ourselves.

If Standard Operating Procedure does not make you think about anything other than what happened at Abu Ghraib and who's responsible, then I wonder whether you were really paying attention.",1347580800,14,2100,5.140762463343108

3535638,5,B001DPHD92,"PROS: This deep and gripping documentary film investigates the context of the infamous photographs taken at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003-2004 that show the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers. It is an  important film about human nature under extreme conditions. The film is more about psychology than politics. Errol Morris does not try to assign blame to any one person or any specific group. He is answering questions such as: Why were these photographs taken at all? What was their context?

The film is the result of more than 200 hours of interviews with the soldiers who were either present in the photos or took them. The photographs both expose and conceal facts. And, oddly, these iconic photographs conceal more than they expose. The young soldiers who abused prisoners at Abu Ghraib appear quite normal, not some sort of cruel monsters as one is tempted to conclude from the horrific photographs (although Charles Graner, whom the Army refused to let interviewed, does appear to be more sinister than average). Most of them were very young and inexperienced people who have been thrust into Abu Ghraib, under frequent mortar attacks of Iraqis. They have feelings just like everyone else, and their little dramas intertwine in a surreal way with the prisoner abuse. The viewer of the film can sympathize with these soldiers, even though what they had done is so absolutely wrong and inexcusable.

The torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib was going on already when these soldiers got assigned there. The photos documenting the abuse were taken because the abuse was the norm - the soldiers probably did not imagine that one day the photos would be used against them. The infamous photo of the hooded man with the wires attached to his hands (probably the most iconic picture from the war in Iraq) depicted the kind of behavior that was not considered criminal, but was considered standard operating procedure. The torture was encouraged from the higher ups, none of whom were either charged or sent to jail. In fact, no one above the level of staff sergeant went to jail. The female soldier who posed in one of the infamous photos with her thumbs up next to a prisoner who was tortured to death was sent to jail, but the known CIA operative who beat that prisoner to death was never charged. One is tempted to ask: was the crime killing the prisoner, or taking the photos? We see the threads of the chain of command going up, up, up - but Errol Morris does not investigate where the threads go. I guess if you are interested in that, you have to watch some other film about Iraq.

The root causes of torture appear so complex, so intertwined, so much part of the human nature, that one can understand why it takes centuries to reduce the stream of torture, and to slowly get us more civilized, bit by bit. It is a sad film, as it shows a dark age of an advanced Western democracy (you can only imagine what happens in Russian or Chinese prisons). But the very fact that films like this exist, and that we can freely watch them makes me think that we did make some progress since the real Dark Ages. As long as we do not turn away, as long as we are able to take a good look at ourselves, there is hope for us ahead.

CONS: Reenactments and music are very well done (perhaps too well done) and occupy a significant part of the film (perhaps too much). They carry extra emotional charge without carrying documentary value. In my opinion, the interviews and the photos carry enough emotional charge on their own and need only minimal reenactments and perhaps no music.",1312070400,2,3592,4.650393700787402

Slow is more like it.

It takes great pains to show how the film was developed, how they picked it apart, and the impressionable soldiers working there.

I watched a good 90 minutes.  It felt like 5 hours.

3535641,5,B001DPHD92,This docu-movie has the actual people who served in Abu Graib sit down and tell you about their experiences! It's that simple! Anyone who sias anything else is not interested in reality. It's not that complicated. If I told you my lifes story are you going to call me a liar too?

3535642,2,B001DPHD92,"I was intrigued by the tagline: ""The Scandal Was A Coverup.""  This was promising, because we know that the reversal from denial to an enthusiastic ""investigation"" only occured when the press blew the story to the public.  So how do you respond, when the world is horrified and demanding explanations?

You pick a sacrificial lamb.  Then you kill it.

So, here you have the documentary that tries to explain what actually happened.  And yet it fails, on several accounts:

1) It gave the people directly interviewed-- in particular, Lynndie England, Sabrina Harmon, and Janis Karpinski-- a unchecked forum to cast the story their way.  Let them have their say, yes-- but their claims should also be validated or challenged through other evidence, if your purpose is to get at the truth.  Instead, the filmmaker chose to let them talk unchallenged for hours, interspersed with sympathetic visuals showing closeups of handwritten letters and violin music.  What are we to make of this?  Where are the interviews with the Iraqi prisoners, for instance?  With interrogation experts?  Psychologists?  Military trainers?

2) Very rarely does Morris explore where these people came from: their family background, how they grew up, why they chose the military, what they learned in training, how they ended up doing this job, how they think about their country and the rest of the world.  You would think that might be important, but you only get accidental hints.  Instead, the message seems to be that they are ""Anyone USA""-- that they were just helpless pawns, like anyone else would be in the same situation.  I don't believe it.

3) It never really gets to the heart of why it happened.  Everybody in the film is to some degree an ""accidental bystander"" to the main event, if you believe their account-- and yet no one is ultimately blamed, either.  There are the vague references to anonymous people who told them what to do, and top-level administration officials.  But what about the culture that made it possible to go through with it?  What about the messaging from the Bush administration?  What about the system of desensitizing Americans to the pain and suffering of other human beings that goes on BOTH through formal military training and the ""culture"" in a warzone?  There's almost nothing on this.

4) Rarely does the filmmaker pursue the real psychological motivations that many of us suspect: I did it because I could.  I did it because I enjoyed it.  I did it *because* I knew it was wrong-- because it was taboo.  I did it out of revenge.  I did it because I was feeling sadistic.  I did it to regain power in a powerless situation.  Again, there are hints but apparently very little probing.  I guess this is a certain style of filmmaking.

The best thing it does-- near the end-- is to explain the rationale behind what is judged ""Standard Operating Procedure"" and what constitutes a criminal act, in terms of the photos.  And, also, to show the cropped and altered photos that were used in the media, and separate out fact from interpretation in evaluating photos.  And to give the accused a chance (with piano music) to describe how they saw their accusations.

But I don't see any great accomplishment in simply telling a (different) one-sided story.  Was there a culture of torture?  Yes.  Was there a calculated effort to cover up the high-level mistakes, the lack of leadership?  Yes.  I believe this is true.  But that is no excuse for letting these people off the hook so easily.  It's almost nothing more than a propaganda film for the people who agreed to interview.  And that, sadly, is a huge failure.",1276732800,6,3627,4.826016260162602
3535643,4,B001DPHD92,"Based on more/less known worldwide images produced by and of abusing the Iraqi inmates, a doco leaves impression that this event was a very single occurrence conducted by sexually-concerned power-hungry individuals operating at this jail.

Mixing up the interrogating procedures with this bacchanalia of S&M (is it so rare events outside this prison, country, round a globe in general?)taken place at the female soldier's 21st birthday party hardly convinced a reviewer in even a shadow of a collective guilt committed by the US military by interrogating local armed crims as some de facto pro-islamist media sometimes attempted.

How many people was murdered at least in Iraq by insurgency during this doco had been produced?",1270684800,,726,5.359649122807017
3535644,3,B001DPHD92,"If you are unfamiliar with the name ""Abu Ghraib"" then you shouldn't even be reading this review or considering this film for viewing.  I would suggest getting some, less graphic information about this situation before venturing on.

I don't think anyone denies the attrosities that happened in this prison/interegation station.  I think the only things that are still somewhat hidden/denied/ignored are the names behind the exact horrors and the depth of knowledge (of these actions) by those who should have been on top of every detail.

Be prepared for the real nitty-gritty.  This documentary is not meant for an after-dinner social hour and certainly not for children, those who are squeemish or those people who are proud of the actions (or lack-there-of) of then President Bush, his Staff, our Government Officials and a few Generals.

Be prepared for some hard-core, hard hitting facts with picture proof.",1262563200,2,912,5.212328767123288
3535647,4,B001DPHD92,"Engrossing and rife with the director's usual artistic flouishes, ""Standard Operating Procedure"" doesn't quite let those now infamous U.S. prison keepers at Abu Ghraib off the hook, but credibly purports that things were maybe a little more complicated than those equally infamous photographs seemed to indicate.  Most chillingly, we see evidence that the most disquieting activities at the prison were the ones that weren't photographed, involving personnel who were too cagey and calculating to let themselves anywhere near a camera.

Due to Mr. Morris' balanced portrayal of the soldiers and honest attempt to get at the truth of the whole sorry mess, one actually comes to somewhat like- or at least feel a little sympathy for- the prison keepers who were interviewed, despite their unquestionably insensitive activities in the photographs.  An audio commentary by Mr. Morris and a fascinating collection of deleted scenes further fuel the film's supposition that perhaps the net of blame should have been cast a little wider during that whole sad episode in the Iraq conflict.

""Standard Operating Procedure"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD, with composer Danny Elfman's minimalist and haunting music somehow channeling the best work of Philip Glass, Mr. Morris' usual composer, on the moodily effective soundtrack.",1254700800,,1327,5.458536585365854
3535648,5,B001DPHD92,"This is an excellent film documenting abuses by the US Military and US Military Intelligence services at the Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War.  For general background on the events at Abu Gharib, you can visit Wikipedia or do news article searches.

This film is valuable not only because it reveals more information about the events, but also because it allows some of the Military personnel involved to tell their own stories.  These stories may be true or they may simply be self-serving tales (the soldiers coloring their involvement in a light most favorable).  It is fascinating to watch the people involved as they shape and reveal their involvement, actions, and justifications.

The film gives some sense of the timing of events and the long hours, days, and weeks of conduct.  The film also shows video footage of the events, video that is less known than the photos.

It takes courage to admit you've participated in unethical or criminal actions.  I admire the courage and decisions of everyone who agreed to participate in telling their own stories.

The events at Abu Ghraib are horrific. Corruption often comes because  leadership is either corrupt or indifferent to corruption.  It's difficult to be less corrupt than the leadership you are required to follow.

3535649,4,B001DPHD92,"Standard Operating Procedure is an inexpensively made documentary of Americans who committed atrocities against people they were there to liberate instead of humiliate or obliterate. There are interviews with the cast of characters who participated in these degradations, including one sergeant who reported abuse, a chastened piece of trailer trash named Lynndie England, and Brigadier General (BG) Janis Karpinski. The most sickening part of all were the pictures of inmates forming pyramids and pictures of female soldiers smiling over a corpse, or another with a leash on a detainee. The music, effective, sets the mood for the viewer to open up a can of whoopas on some fellow Americans for their brutality and stupidity.

The film's strength is that it makes me ask myself what I would have done. Having been a junior cavalry officer thirty years ago, I have to ask myself, would I have followed orders or would I have treated the detainees within the articles of the Geneva Convention? Would I have been like the enlisted man who decided to punish one detainee because he had been told that he was brought in for rape? Would I have stood up to the civilians, military intelligence, or the C.I.A. who came through there like it was Times Square? Or, would have been like one sergeant who refused to participate and reported what he saw to his officer who did nothing?! These images tempered my thoughts and my outrage, because I know what I would do at this age, but what would I have done at twenty-eight?

BG Karpinski seemed set up to fail by having all the responsibility, but no authority, a sure sign that you will fry if anything goes wrong. She is in charge of a prison that has a capacity for 200 that very quickly reaches 2000. She is in charge of several prisons over a wide geographical area. She is ordered not to release anyone. This includes people thrown in there for street altercations and other non-terrifying acts. Major General Miller arrives with Carte Blanche from (?) to bring the same ""correction techniques"" from Guantanamo Bay to Abu-Ghraib.

The part of the film that could make any viewer want to down a seltzer water with a Pepto Bismol chaser or punch a bag, was the sickening rationale given by some some enlisted for what they did. The woman who smiled broadly over the corpse of a dead Iraqi general defended her photo with, ""I always smile for pictures."" There was the once cocky Lynndie England explain how she was duped and seduced by SPC Graner who would later deny that her baby was his. The most poignant was a staff sergeant who admitted that we had lost our way, that we knew why we were in Kuwait in 1991, but forgot why we were in Iraq in 2003.

This movie loses its charm for me because it doesn't add to what I already know. It's what I suspect and don't know that is important: How come no one higher than staff sergeant was convicted by court martial? When will those who gave the orders be brought to justice? As a signatory of the Geneva Convention we have agreed that if any country indicts, say, our former president or secretary of Defense, we are duty bound to hand them over or try them ourselves.

The sad news is that due to popular ignorance, many people feel that military prison is somehow harsh or harsher than civilian ones. It isn't. (I've known of one soldier sentenced to thirty years, paroled after three). That means that tormentors, such as Graner might be out much sooner than you think, and people like Rumsfeld, Yoo, Bush, and Cheney are not going at all.

With this story, my need for self-flagellation as a relief for masochistic feelings of national guilt is coming to an end. I know what happened. Now I just want justice. I want those who promulgated such orders to be brought to it. In fact it should be.

3535651,3,B001DPHD92,"I was very disappointed with this movie.

It drags on in the same style and tone for nearly two hours.

There is too liberal use of the depressing musical score.

The movie covers just a slim wedge of a very large story. It lets a few people who were at the prison, who were peripherally involved in the worst incidents, vent their versions of the story. Each of these persons has an axe to grind. Without more context, I cannot tell how credible each one is. Are they trying to excuse their actions? or their inaction? Are they trying to point the finger elsewhere?

When I finished the documentary, I still had very little information about who was really responsible for the torture. Private contractors? CIA? Military intelligence? Clearly the people least responsible for these incidents were punished, while those who ordered or performed the most serious abuse and murder of prisoners went free. But I knew that much before I watched the documentary!

I believe there are two important topics that should have been covered in the movie. First, there are obvious questions about exactly who was in charge and who gave the orders. Why were such techniques sanctioned? Should those who ordered this extreme treatment be jailed, instead of the low-level military police?

Second, I think it must not be denied that the release of the Abu Ghraib photos inflamed the insurgency, and one wonders how many Americans (and Iraqis) died because of that. I'd like to get those who were responsible for making the case public (it was already under military investigation) under the klieg lights and ask them if it was worth making the Iraq conflict worse and leading to more deaths on both sides. Will they accept responsibility for their actions? But when will the media ever learn to take responsibility for the mayhem they cause? That is certainly an element of this tragedy that few have wanted to examine, least of all Errol Morris.",1232582400,5,1931,4.836363636363636
3535652,4,B001DPHD92,"In Standard Operating Procedure, the acclaimed director Erroll Morris turns his unique directorial eye towards the fiasco of Abu Ghraib prison. Morris's films (Dr. Death, Fog of War) tend to focus on the dark side of human psychology, and this film is no different. Through interviews with those involved in the strange incidents of torture at Abu Ghraib - inlcuding Lindy England - we get to see the human faces on the seemingly inhuman (or at very least, unAmerican) acts of torture that came to plague Abu Ghraib.

In focusing on the moral aspects of the Abu Ghraib events, this film reminds me much of Hanna Arendt's book ""Eichmann in Jerusalem."" In the interviews, for instance, we begin to see - even if we cannot begin to understand - how seemingly good people can begin to do evil things by being placed in situations where moral lines are blurry at best. Morris does a good job in conveying the moral ambiguities of Abu Ghraib to us by interspersing very human interviews with very inhuman (and often raw) pictures of torture often involving the interviewees. Do we feel sorry for Lindy England, or do we feel anger towards her when we see pictures of her - thumbs up - holding an Iraqi by a leash? Morris doesn't give us an answer, but lets thke soldiers tell their own story.

Those who are at all squeamish might think twice before viewing SOP. Unlike the network media who originally showed the pictures of tortured Iraqis, Morris is under no obligation, or inclination, to blur the more disturbing parts of photos. Dead and bloodied faces are showm, as are genitalia. Morris wants to give us the whole story, and that means showing us images that can be quite disturbing.

As one of mixed feelings about the goings on in Iraq, I will also note that the film, by its very nature, may seem quite politically biased. While there is no commentary or narrator, I am sure that Morris edited the interviews to suit a political opinion. While it would be hard to approve of what went on at Abu Ghraib, we hear no interviews from those attempting to morally justify what went on, or at least try and minimize the moral blameworthiness of the affair. While I am not sure how convincing such voices would be, I know they exist, and it would have been good if Morris included them in the name of fairness.

That really is my only criticism of the film. As I said, the film does a good job in conveying the ""Eichmann-esque"" element of the Abu Ghraib scandal. By letting the soldiers tell their own story, we are offered a picture of a sitaution that got out of hand, feeding quickly off of its own downward momentum. We watch a group of soldiers faced with a large and pressing situation (get the Iraqis to confess) and get swept away by the utilitarian ""ends justify the means"" logic.

So, whatever you think of the film or the Abu Ghraib fiasco, do not think for a second that you can watch this film and walk away (for better or worse) unafffected.",1232150400,,2952,4.562264150943396
3535653,4,B001DPHD92,"We're all familiar with the images that began flowing out of Abu Ghraib Prison in the spring of 2004 - photos showing detainees (some terrorists, others undoubtedly not) hooded and stripped, forced to assume painful and/or humiliating positions, often for hours on end, with American soldiers posing gleefully nearby, smiling and flashing thumbs-up signs for the camera.  Once the pictures went viral, they came to symbolize not only the botched operation that was the Iraq war, but the fundamental failure of the U.S. military to win friends and influence people in a land the Bush administration claimed vehemently to be ""liberating.""

In ""Standard Operating Procedure,"" famed documentary filmmaker Errol Morris (""The Thin Blue Line"") attempts to uncover the truth behind those photographs, mainly by allowing those who were most closely involved with the scandal to tell the story in their own words (including Private First Class Lynndie England, who, whether fairly or unfairly, emerged as the one clearly identifiable ""face"" and household name from the scandal).  Morris provides no voiceover narration to accompany the interviews, just re-enactments of the incidents done in a quasi-surrealistic style, using slow motion photography and artsy graphics.

Through his discussions with the principal players in the drama, Morris provides a probing study of the effects of war time stress on the human psyche.  The film offers no easy answers as to exactly why the events at Abu Ghraib unfolded as they did; yet, while it  doesn't turn the individuals involved into easy-to-blame villains, it doesn`t completely exonerate them either.  In fact, it is the seeming ""normalcy"" of these people, as they attempt to make their case for the camera, that renders their actions all the more unsettling.  Morris also makes it clear that these low level individuals - many of whom have served time in prison for their crimes - were most certainly used as scapegoats for higher-ups in the military who managed to successfully deflect any personal culpability for the events that took place there.

In a true journalistic coup, Morris was able to obtain grainy home movies shot at the same time that the pictures were being taken.  As a result, we're able to witness the step-by-step process by which that infamous shot of the naked men stacked in a pyramid formation ultimately came about.

""Standard Operating Procedure"" doesn't successfully address all the questions it sets out to answer, but that is hardly a weakness of the film, since it is dealing with a complex, messy situation involving complex, messy people caught up in a complex, messy war.  One doesn't leave ""Standard Operating Procedure"" necessarily more enlightened that when one went in - just more well-informed.  And that's perhaps the best one could reasonably hope for under the circumstances.",1231632000,,2856,5.2368421052631575
3535654,4,B001DPHD92,"As is obvious in the complex responses to both the book and the film by Errol Morris and Philip Gourevitch, STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE places in our faces some facts we would rather shield than discuss.  The story of the period of between September 2003 and February 2004 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq is so well known not only from the news media but also from the Internet blogging sites that it need not be outlined in a review of this film.  The facts documented by photographs taken by those who participated and observed the inhuman treatment of prisoners are indisputable: seeing them on the screen in full frame and in close-up shots  is almost more than the compassionate eye can tolerate.  But there it is and yes, we do need to witness the abuse and humiliation that describes the US prisoner treatment in Iraq, no matter who is to blame - enlisted personnel, MI, high ranking military officials, the White House.  The fact that it occurred as such a gross abuse of human rights should awaken in all of us a more complete awareness that war makes humans do such things.  It is ugly to watch, difficult to digest, and extremely trying on our set of beliefs that man's inhumanity to man has and does exist despite our need to believe otherwise.

Given the atrocities documented by this film, the style of the film as a work of cinema deserves to be addressed also.  The flow of the documentary with the interplay of interview pieces by those infamous  young people upon whose shoulders the blame was placed in what appears to be a diversionary technique to avoid deeper probing of the true guilt, along with the images of the prison itself - stark lines of cellblocks and living conditions so foul they seem to actually smell on the screen - is well conceived and beautifully/creatively captured by cinematographers Robert Chappell and Robert Richardson and enhanced by a strangely appropriate musical scoring by Danny Elfman.  The film may be about things ugly, but the technique used to tell the story is high quality art.

Abu Ghraib, along with Guantanamo, will always be a scar on the conscience of America, even beyond the time that this ugly Iraq war is over.  We should all look at this film with the hope that with seeing actual footage of a nightmare may help prevent recurrences in the future.  Grady Harp, November 08",1227744000,7,2343,4.685365853658537
3535655,5,B001DPHD92,"Having just watched this film on the DVD both with the normal soundtrack and with Errol Morris's Commentary track, I have to say that ""From Hades"" seems to be significantly misrepresenting (or failing to appreciate) the filmmaker's intentions and practices here.

The customer review section of an Amazon product page is a poor venue for a discussion of the historical truth underlying this disgraceful episode in our history, but anyone who watches this film dispassionately should, I think, conclude that Morris is making a much more complex suite of points, both historical and philosophical, than the other reviewer suggests. This is a beautifully executed work and I found it more morally grounded and serious than Morris's previous work--which I generally like, but which at times has been a bit hyper-stylized and marred by an addiction to tilted camera angles and the exhibitionistically vertiginous musical jackhammerings of Philip Glass (Danny Elfman provides a great and original score here).

It's clear that Morris has more disdain for the Bush administration than for the participants at Abu Ghraib, and many who view the film may be skeptical of the moral veracity of all interviewees here, but this is well worthy of attention as a contribution to current history and to the art of the documentary film. And its moral earnestness points a way toward our collective expiation of a dismal period in our history (and that of the world).",1226793600,3,1449,5.135593220338983
3535656,1,B001DPHD92,"Representatives for film director Errol Morris told me during pre-production that ""Standard Operating Procedure"" would be the very best documentary on the abuses of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib - the one that would tell the whole truth.

I had pinned great hope on that. It didn't turn out that way.

My perspective on the Abu Ghraib scandal came from spending from September 2003 to February 2004 at the Iraq prison as a sergeant in Army Intelligence. Working the 8 p.m.-to- 8 a.m. night shift, it was impossible not to notice who was directing the operation. And I shared all this with Morris.

But now I've seen the film and I'm disappointed. Morris does little to get to the bottom of what happened. He muddies already opaque waters regarding who was actually responsible for the abuse of prisoners.

The film focuses on the awful photos, the people in them and those who took them. This perspective plays right into the hands of the cover-up artists. It perpetuates the myth that the abuses are rightfully laid at the feet of those impressionable, but very human, young soldiers.

Morris should have been looking up the chain of command; at the civilian and military officials actually responsible for ordering these Military Police Reservists to rough up prisoners.

A no-holds-barred documentary? Give me a break.

Finally, the Whole Truth!

I was first put into contact with the makers of ""SOP"" while I was still in the Army. From the beginning, I was told this was going to be a huge project with the production support of Sony Pictures Entertainment; and that Morris, who had won an Oscar with his documentary, ""The Fog of War,"" would be at the helm.

This was to be the breakthrough investigation into what really happened at Abu Ghraib, who was responsible for the abuse and why it was ordered - the project that really got people's attention, going where previous investigators and media had feared to tread.

Call me gullible but, believing this was to be a groundbreaking work, I fully cooperated with Morris. I assisted him in his quest for documents, videos, photos, notes and helped him contact fellow soldiers who were at Abu Ghraib and knew what happened.

When I was discharged from the Army in October 2006, I went to Boston for a two-day interview.

Morris asked me to sign several contracts before and after the interviews, and I did as he asked without paying much attention to them. I do remember however, that in one contract Morris agreed to pay me one dollar.

In any event, I never got the dollar, but was reminded of this last week when I read in the New York Times that others got paychecks for their participation.

I have never asked for or taken money for media interviews. To me, that undermines the process and trivializes the importance of the issues of torture and prisoner mistreatment and their meaning for the moral atmosphere in our country as a whole.

When the film was finished, Morris told me he had intended to use some of the footage from my two days of interviews and the materials I provided, but decided in the end to ""narrowly focus"" on the Military Police. This, of course, is what so many others have done and is in the worst tradition of a Nixon-style ""modified, limited hangout.""

Chain of Command?

Here's the oddest thing: Even though Morris's lens is trained on the Military Police, he does find room for a civilian interrogator, Tim Dugan, who worked at Abu Ghraib for CACI, a contractor factory for civilian interrogators.

I witnessed for myself how civilian personnel, like Dugan, corrupted the military. Indeed, they were the genesis of the break from conventional interrogation techniques into what Vice President Dick Cheney hinted at when he spoke of the ""dark side"" of intelligence.

It was they who ordered the Military Police and some of my own unit's Military Intelligence soldiers to ""soften"" the detainees for interrogation, and encouraged the behavior depicted in the photographs. I know; I was there. And, of course, I told Errol Morris.

So I was surprised, to say the least, to see Morris giving Dugan a place to contend that, essentially, the abuses were all the military's fault.

Odd indeed. Even Maj. Gen. George Fay, whose investigation of Abu Ghraib left much to be desired, reported the pernicious effect civilian interrogators had on the impressionable and inexperienced soldiers.

Fay reported, for example that Daniel Johnson, one of Dugan's CACI interrogator colleagues, whom I knew at Abu Ghraib, was using Spc. Charles Graner as ""muscle"" for his interrogations.

And yet, Morris describes Dugan as ""remarkable."" Remarkable, indeed, Errol.

Did no one tell you that CACI, Dugan and several of his fellow interrogators were sued by their victims in Abu Ghraib, seeking to hold them accountable for their behavior?

In the civil case brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Abu Ghraib prisoners, the lawsuit implicates Dugan in the abuse.

""CACI interrogator Timothy Dugan also tortured plaintiffs and other prisoners,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""For example, he physically dragged handcuffed plaintiffs and other prisoners along the ground to inflict pain on them. He struck and beat plaintiffs and other prisoners. He bragged to a non-conspirator about scaring a prisoner with threats to such a degree that the prisoner vomited.

""When a young non-conspirator directed him to cease the torture and comply [with] Army Field Manual 34-52, Dugan scoffed at his youth and refused to follow the direction.""

The lawsuit further alleges that Dugan took part in a CACI cover-up of when a detainee died by going through ""the charade of interrogating a prisoner who was already dead as part of the conspiracy's efforts to conceal a murder."" Dugan is accused, too, of threatening a fellow CACI employee who talked to investigators.

CACI has denounced the lawsuit as baseless, and the individual defendants were dismissed out on a technicality. However, on Nov. 6, 2007, U.S. District Court Judge James Robertson in Washington denied CACI's motion for summary judgment and ordered a jury trial against CACI.

A criminal investigation also is pending in the Eastern District of Virginia concerning some of the CACI employees.

In ""SOP,"" Dugan presents himself as a whistleblower who tried to stop the abuses. He claims that he reported to his ""section sergeant"" that two Army female interrogators were stripping detainees naked as an interrogation technique, and how shocked he was to see this.

Dugan claims he got the brush-off; was told not to get involved. So who was this ""section sergeant?"" And is he/she above the law?

Why did Dugan not offer himself as a witness in any of the various investigations? Where has he been if he felt then the way he now says he did? Again, why sport the good-guy badge now?

I came away with the impression that Morris was unprepared for the interview and was being taken for a ride.

CACI's Defense

For obvious reasons, CACI has gone to extraordinary lengths to separate itself from the horrors of Abu Ghraib, arguing that the military alone was at fault.

CACI recently announced the release of a book, Our Good Name: A Company's Fight To Defend Its Honor And Get The Truth About Abu Ghraib.

CACI contends strongly that its interrogators adhered to the military chain of command, something it has been feverishly trying to establish in the lawsuits against it.

And so, the behavior captured in the photos? That was the military's responsibility, not CACI's.

That is not what I observed from my ringside seat.

I told Morris that the reality was that the civilian contractors paid little heed to the military chain of command, and that they were the ones actually running the show. That didn't make it into the final version of ""SOP.""

Even though it is now an established fact that between 70 to 90 percent of detainees at Abu Ghraib were completely innocent, something I learned directly on site, Dugan implies that the harsh interrogation practices applied there were legitimate - except of course for the failings of the military.

This myth-making is intended to hold CACI harmless and help it maintain its very lucrative government contracts. CACI International had $1.6 billion in revenues in 2005. Folks have always told me it all has to do with money; I suppose they're right.

But Congress should be asking some simple questions. It should start by asking why civilian contractors are being employed in connection with the interrogation of persons under detention in wartime, a function which previously has been entirely in the hands of the uniformed military?

This could yield some interesting answers. Indeed, evasion of military rules and discipline as well as avoidance of congressional oversight might be at the heart of the answers.

Morris takes pride in calling ""SOP"" a horror movie and - with the mood music and the needless slow-motion reenactments - he makes sure of that.

However, ""SOP"" does little more than humanize some of the ""bad apples"" (a good thing, I suppose), while gratuitously absolving the civilian interrogators actually responsible for fouling those apples.

But, wait. Abu Ghraib is not primarily about Military Police - or civilian interrogators. It is about the many thousands of wrongfully detained Iraqis - many of them abused, tortured and even killed. It is also about their families. What about their story?

Morris has called ""SOP"" just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" citing the unused volumes of material he's collected since production began. But Morris owed his viewers a glimpse of the whole iceberg, not just the small misleading piece that bobbed above the surface.

He has announced his next film project: a comedy. Go figure.",1221955200,204,9717,4.9679012345679014

Heavy viewing material but worthwhile. A few reflections ... :

It's unfortunate, but not at all shocking, that the people held responsible for criminal acts were all enlisted soldiers. I agree that they were in a catch-22 situation. Soldiers can't resign in protest or to demonstrate civil disobedience. And the military isn't fond of whistleblowers either. Not only did Army officers deflect blame but so did CIA and FBI agents and, frankly, so did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and President George W. Bush. After the story broke, Rumsfeld and Bush made evident they had okayed what they euphemistically called ""enhanced interrogation procedures"" because ""the United States does not commit torture. Ever."" Rumsfeld offered to resign his Cabinet position, but Bush, till after he was re-elected, would not be swayed that Rumsfeld didn't have the moral authority or vision to perform his job effectively. This is dj vu by this point. How many more times will Americans let military leaders blame enlisted soldiers with no consequences to officers?

That said, I was a bit struck by some interviewees who still did not recognize why their actions were wrong. I realize they were in a dangerous situation with no escape clause, but after being convicted and spending time in prison with nothing but free time to ponder what they had done, some were adamant they were irrationally blamed. I'm not judging their perspective, just noting I found this interesting because even the photos labeled standard operating procedure I personally thought were cruel and/or dehumanizing, given Iraqi prisoners in all likelihood were observant Muslims and would be horrified to have a female soldier cut their clothes off with a knife, watch them shower, etc.

And it was all for naught anyway. The majority of those prisoners did not know state secrets, nor have most prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The most solid outcome of the mistreatment of these ""terrorists"" and ""enemy combatants"" (another euphemism, used instead of ""prisoners of war,"" who have rights and eventual release dates under the Geneva Convention) is swaying large groups of men and their soon-to-be-adults children, who have legal and/or easy access to automatic weapons, to consider the United States an enemy that has no respect for other sovereign nations or the Muslim faith.",1525737600,,2510,5.56544502617801

8294447,5,B001DPHD92,"This is another brilliant documentary from director Errol Morris. The film is both an examination of the scandal and subsequent courts-martial surrounding the revelation of the so-called ""torture photos"" taken at the prison in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, and a general investigation of the evidentiary value of photos: how they can both help us and lead us astray in an attempt to reconstruct a series of past events. Interviews with many of the immediate principals add a powerful testimonial dimension to the flow of first-hand images and carefully crafted reconstructions: vintage Morris. At its very heart, though, Standard Operating Procedure is a film about the morality  of our invasion of Iraq and the ""standard operating procedures"" that both allowed for (even encouraged) the commission of horrendously degrading and abusive criminal acts -- whether or not they technically qualify as torture -- and the placement of young, untrained, ill-prepared MPs in a situation where they were almost inevitably ready to assume the role of perpetrators and recorders. Although Morris is careful not to excuse the actions of the young soldiers involved in the grisly photo shoots, he does make it clear that he sees a trail of blood that leads much higher up the chain of command than the ""few bad apples"" explanation proffered by the government at the time. Indeed, the film ALMOST has a protagonist: specialist Sabrina Harman, a photogenic ""girl-next-door"" type, who took the majority of the photos, and claims to have been a kind of undercover documentarian in her own right: although the photos in fact reached the public via a more circuitous route, leaving Harman high and dry in the Navy brig at Miramar. -- Morris makes great use of the pathos embodied in the letters that Harman apparently sent to her female partner during the unrolling of the events chronicled in the film. And it is almost impossible not to feel sympathy for this young, personable and apparently bright kid who seems to have been caught up as if in a spider's web. Beyond that, however, Morris makes it overwhelmingly clear that, whatever the guilt or complicity of the ""rotten apples"" at Abu Ghraib, the administration's sanction of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" functioned as an open invitation (and not just at Abu Ghraib) to the employment of torture and abuse to the extent that one of the government's own forensic specialists, an expert involved in the initial examination of the photos prior to the filing of charges against the Abu Ghraib defendants, was forced to concede that the infamous photo of the hooded prisoner with arms outstretched and balanced on a box involved the employment of a ""standard [interrogation] operating procedure"" and hence did not involve the commission of a prosecutable crime.",1445558400,,2789,5.12967032967033

In my humble opinion, it was tragic all around in regards to both the scandal and what happened to the soldiers.

England is honest enough to admit that Graner influenced her to pose in those photos and that she did it for love. However, at the time of that interview, he still had little to do with their son.  Additionally, she was still seeking employment years after the incident ( as per an NBC news article on her from March 19 2013). I actually hope that things get better for Lynndie England because she served her time for the incidents and her son's life also hangs in the balance.
