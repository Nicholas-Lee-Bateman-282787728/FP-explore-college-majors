This is RAW reels of 2nd Infantry Division footage that have been spliced together.  This is SILENT video.  There's no music, narration, sound effects, etc.  It's ONLY video.

This DVD is a compliation of several 3-5 minute film reels of the 2nd Infantry as filmed by military cameramen.  Before each segment begins, there is a brief text description shown on the screen listing the date, location, and content of the upcoming segment.  The video quality of some of the segments isn't that great, but most of it is good considering its age.

This DVD covers a specific time period ending with the last reel filmed on August 8, 1944.  My great-uncle was in the 2nd ID and was killed in action on the following day (Aug 9th).  I knew nothing about his military service and was looking for specific footage of the 2nd ID.  This video delivered and gave me a first-hand perspective of what his short life in the 2nd must have been like.

Bottom Line:  If you're looking for a well-produced documentary of the 2nd ID, this isn't it.  If you are looking for an interesting perspective of a specific military unit like the 2nd Infantry, ""Combat Reels"" delivers.",1201564800,4,1421,4.738775510204082
