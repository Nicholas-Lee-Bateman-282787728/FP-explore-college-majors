8581887,4,B0073WOZZO,"This is an excellent floor-barre for people with or without ballet experience. The exercises are accessible, clear, and very good for building strength, learning to initiate movement from correct positions, and maintaining correct placement through movements. I am very glad I bought it.

I do agree with the reservations expressed by the previous reviewer, however. The DVD needs to be longer with more exercises (preferably some at the barre), and better edited. While I have benefited very much from the simple but sound exercises in this DVD I can imagine that for it to be more commercially successful it needs to meet higher standards both in content and technical matters.",1360281600,3,679,5.172727272727273
8581888,3,B0073WOZZO,"As an adult ballet student, I have been following Eric Conrad's videos on YouTube for a while, and when he announced this DVD's forthcoming release, I was so glad. I have a great deal of respect for Eric Conrad and find that he is one of the most knowledgeable men in the West concerning correct ballet technique, so I was really excited, after months of waiting, to finally be able to purchase this DVD.

  First, as to the packaging. The DVD cover is of home-made quality, the videos could use some editing, and the sound of Eric's voice on the ""Workout with Explanations"" part was not great. On the ""Workout without Explanations"" part there is no voice-over whatsoever, so you have to keep looking at the screen all the time to keep up. In the introduction Eric promises a daily blog and invities the customers to leave comments on the product's site, but the site is un-maintained. However, these are all minor issues that I was willing to overlook.

  The real problem is the main content. The promotion videos promised a workout to transform one's body, help to lose weight, etc. Indeed, the explanations of correct form are excellent and the exercises felt really  great. BUT! The actual workout, without pausing for explanations, only lasts 15 minutes!!! You're all warmed up, ready to go, when the session suddenly ends, followed by a preview for the sequel ""coming soon"".

  I really don't understand. Other workout videos of the same price offer, on average, between 60 to 90 minutes of exercise. Also, on the DVD's cover there are two pictures of Svetlana, Eric's wife, who demonstrates the exercises: in one she is plump and plainly-dressed, and in the other she is tens of pounds lighter, glamorously made up and dressed up, posing like a model. The title says: ""Svetlana's Results After Completing Disc 1"". Did all this happen to her after a 15-min workout?

 In short, I really wanted to recommend this DVD. Had it been even twice longer, I would. But I don't think it's fair to the customers not to state in advance that this is only a half (or third) of a workout, sold for the price of one.",1338854400,13,2109,4.6702702702702705
