866192,5,6304396015,"...If you wonder what all this means you will have to try the Tortoise. It is definitely different. You will either hate it or love it or maybe even both. Or you may hate it now and come back to it when you are into serious fitness and fall in love. The quick quick summary is that if you are already a FIRM lover, or if you are an advanced exerciser looking for an interesting and unusual routine, this may be just the right work-out for you!
Designed to work on alternate days with the HARE work-out (which I reviewed separately) this workout emphasizes slow moves with heavier weights. If weight work does not appeal to you (although it should, for overall fitness) then don't bother picking up this one. In this hour-long video you will use weights for thorough upper body sculpting as well as for the lower body (in lunges) and you will also use the tall step box to shape and define your lower body. Naturally, you need equipment - you will need weights 5-8lb dumbells for beginners (the cast uses a barbell but you can use dumbells) and two step boxes - tall (10-14 inches) and short (about 4 inches).
This workout is spiced up with short (and relatively easy) aerobic sequences to ballroom music. You will get your heart rate up to the cha cha, the tango, the waltz and others, complete with curtsies at the end. Weird? Maybe. But this may also be the exact weird thing you need to have a blast while getting some SERIOUS work done. I personally loved it.
The workout starts with an unusual ab work sequence in the beginning. This is different from traditional workouts where this is saved for last, but unless you just can't ""stomach"" starting out this way, this shouldn't bother you. Tracy Long cues flawlessly. She also gives instruction on proper form and is generally motivating but very professional. She does not yell at you to get that lazy butt off the couch - she assumes you take fitness seriously and don't need to be reminded of how rewarded you will feel once you are through. Susan Harris, the original FIRM instructor also makes an appearance in this cross trainer series, and leads you through some of the moves.
You alternate between working with weights and then doing some light aerobics to different ballroom tunes. The choreography (using the short step box) may seem complicated at first, but after several times you will follow it with ease. This tape will NOT teach you the ballroom dances - it is just a work-out to ballroom music for variety. If you can't stand ballroom but want to cross train try the FIRM strength and cardio series - same concept.
The weight work will be as difficult as the weights of the dumbells you use. Beginners can do this with no weights - still, this is a pretty advanced work-out. Intermediate to advanced exercisers will probably enjoy it more.
The work-out ends with more ab work and with a good stretching segment.
This workout is different and unusual - but EFFECTIVE. If you want results this is one to get. And if you are a woman and are worried about the body-building theme here, don't dispair - it is very unlikely and almost impossible that you will become the new Miss Hercules by doing this regularly. Chances are you probably won't even get to be as muscular as Tracy Long (maybe if you work VERY hard and use HEAVY weights) - but you will gain beautiful muscle definition, a toned look and you will lose weight.
Overall I give this work-out 5 stars because no matter how you may like or dislike the set, make-up, music, instructor, ballroom theme or anything else - the bottom line is that this is an excellent work-out for the body. Well researched, well executed, well cued - and is a lot more fun than weight work at the gym - at least to me.
Wow, what a long review I've written :D Did not realize I had that much to say...",1024963200,23,3806,4.517391304347826
866193,4,6304396015,"Even though this video requires the use of a barbell, it is still quite intense. Viewers that don't own a barbell (like me) could substitute heavy weights instead. The aerobics section is a bit slower than the aerobics section in the ""Hare"" workout.",1004572800,,249,4.813953488372093
866194,3,6304396015,"Although I have to admit that this is a generally good and challenging workout, I would never buy it.  I borrowed it from a friend since the Tortoise and Hare were the only FIRM videos I hadn't tried.  While I did  enjoy the Hare workout, I found the Tortoise terribly annoying.
The  instructor seems fake, the dancey ""waltz"" moves on the step made  me feel ridiculous, and I think more time was spent switching around the  steps and equipment than on actually exercising.  Don't waste your money on  this video when you could be trying the other GREAT FIRM videos!",953164800,3,565,4.58
866195,5,6304396015,"Tracy Long is the best instructor!  She's motivating, yet not overbearing.  This workout is not for light days.  You will get results even quicker than going to the gym and using machines, but in the privacy of your home  at only a fraction of the price!  I call this ""Death by leg  press"" because you will probably want to die if you you have to do  even one more (I can never make it through all the sets), but boy will your  gluts be great!  I've never had any better success at losing weight, toning  up, and increasing strength than with the FIRM workouts!  And you won't  find a better price than at Amazon.  I hope they re-issue this tape soon  for the sake of you FIRM fellow lovers out there....",953078400,14,704,4.2748091603053435

7870411,5,6304396015,"Ive done a lot of Firm videos and will say that the Tortoise is a favorite of mine. It's an intense workout. I feel great after doing it. There aren't a lot of fast paced, confusing aerobic steps to follow. It's a much slower paced workout with weights. I LOVE THE FIRM. I promise if you stick with the various videos, you will see beautiful results. Especially with use of their ""fanny lifter"". There are beginner videos, FIRM BASICS, that are very simple, but the Tortoise can be a good start for anyone. Maybe work up to the weights when you're ready. I only buy and do The FIRM and Im super happy with the results. If you want great tone and muscle definition, with the benefit of not having to go to the gym, try them!

One reviewer said that this workout is as tough as Vol. 1 & 2, and they aren't lying!  The barbell work in this video is INTENSE, but imagine the shoulders, arms and back you'll be getting while you're working hard.  I don't too much mind the ""dance routines"", as I'm using them to recover from the weight-lifting madness I just got finished with and am about to start again.  The leg presses are killer too!  I (also like other reviewers) am not impressed at all with the newer FIRM workouts...to be honest, you can't go wrong with any FIRM workout taped in the elaborate dance studio.

These old Firm videos can't be beat.

I myself will only use the old firm videos and the new whfn videos produced by Anna Benson

7870414,4,6304396015,"The Tortoise"" is an exercise tape that follows the 'circuit' design -- it alternates between aerobics, stretching, and weightlifting.  The movements are moderately slow and typically require you to really use your muscles.  The moves are all low impact.  A few of movements are loosely based on dances -- Tango, Cha Cha, etc. Some equipment is requried: 3 to 20 lb dumbells, a low 3"" to 7"" step, and a tall 18"" to 22"" step. The instructor is pretty, muscular, and Rubinesque; and she does a nice job directing. The producer spent enough money on the background, direction and supporting exercisers to produce a pleasant tape.

Taken together, ""The Tortoise"" gives a very good muscle building workout for the entire body. It also provides a good aerobic workout. There isn't much for general range of motion, but all major muscle groups are stretched, some repeatedly. This tape was intended to be used with ""The Hare"", which has a greater emphasis on aerobics.

If you tend to do more aerobics than weight bearing exercise, this tape will be good for your body.  My only problem with the tape is that the music and format just aren't as fun as ""The Hare"".

This workout has background music that is enjoyable and varied, some of it inspired by dances (e.g., Tango).  Visually, the workout quite entertaining:  colorful backdrop, statues, murrals on the wall, and a variety of people exercising in different clothing.  It looks like you are in a class with many other people.",1135036800,6,1474,4.836653386454183
7870415,5,6304396015,"Tracie Long's physique should be enough of an inspiration, even if the good sequencing of this workout doesn't impress you. The aerobic segments are a tad lame but I just""do my own thing""during those few minutes of rest between heavy sets. And it is enjoyable-the time seems to fly. Excellent. I bought 2 copies in case one breaks!!!",1118188800,,333,4.758620689655173
7870416,4,6304396015,"As someone who generally loves The Firm series and Tracie Long, I was right in assuming that this workout would be a winner.  As always, Tracie keeps you motivated without being annoying - also the background people stay quiet which is nice.  My overall impression of this video i:
1.  the toning and strength segments using the weights are top-notch - when she is using the barbell - I had no trouble doing the same exercises using two dumbbells.  These segments were tough and gave me a good workout.
2.  the 5 ""cardio"" segments which utilized classic dances for the routines were way too easy and did not even get my heart rate up at all - to be honest after I finished this workout I did 20 minutes of Tae Bo for some cardio benefit.
3.  To summarize, get this video if you are looking for a good strength-building workout for the legs and upper body.  Try the other video in this series ""The Hare"" or the classic firm series videos for cardio.",1096416000,4,948,4.413793103448276
7870417,5,6304396015,"When I first viewed this tape, I hated ballroom the music for the aerobic step parts. I was intimidated by the fancy footwork in those step parts as well, I thought I'd trip all over myself. I was not too eager for the long sets of leg presses...and I avoided it for about two weeks. It didn't take me more than one workout to get hooked on it though. I really like it now. Even the music has gotten better for me, and the fancy footwork is really fun. There is only one aerobic part, the ""charleston"" that I entirely skip simply because I don't like it. Nothing wrong with the cueing or the instructor, I just don't particularly like the routine. So I do something else instead or just skip it and move on to the next part. It's only a few minutes long and won't make or break the rest of the workout.
The Tortoise and the Hare are crosstrainers that work oppositely. So, the Tortoise uses slower music so that you can use heavier weights (At my current level, I can use up to 15-lbs with dumbells or a 35lb barbell and weights for military presses and biceps curls, squats, etc). Among other things, there are two long sets of leg presses on a 14-inch box (or a box height that is best for you based on your current level), a set of weighted squats and a set of weighted dip-backs, and relatively long sets of upper body work. So the workout is as challenging as you make it for yourself, and it's emphasis is on muscle sculpting. In other words, a beginner should have little problem doing the workout with light or no weights as he/she progresses. The advanced should get good results with heavier weights and proper form.
The Hare, it's corresponding crosstrainer, on the contrary, is faster and its emphasis is on cardio work. It has several fast aerobic sections on a 6-inch aerobic step, and the heaviest arm weights (during the aerobic sections) will probably be only 5 ot 7-lb dumbells, ok, maybe 10lbs if the segments aren't too fast for you. Then there are two sets of lighter weighted leg presses, and like 12min of ab/hip/thigh floorwork. So you crosstrain by alternating the two tapes so that your body does not get too used to (or too comfortable) doing the same thing. Plus when you do the heavier work, you can recover while doing the lighter work the next day.
I really like the setting of the old FIRM tapes. The settings are light, airy and IMOHO very well produced. I like the ""class"" setting more than I like the single lone instructor, but that's just me.
The music varies thoughout and with such a variety, there is something for everyone.
The instructor is strong and motivates me to do my best work. The cueing is very good as well, especially with the fancy footwork. The instructor is very experienced and her demeanor is professional and inspiring. I really don't take too well with the bouncy cream puff types, and really appreciate the ""just do it"" instructors who don't gab in between stuff, or sound like minnie mouse, etc. But that's just me. Everyone will find their own motivators.",1047772800,8,3018,4.519195612431444
7870418,3,6304396015,"I was prepared to love this video.  I am a regular ""Joyce Vedral"" user and I wanted some more variety.  In this video, part of the time I couldn't figure out what part I was working, and another part of the time I was trying to keep up with complicated dance steps.  Now and then the instructor would force out a smile, nothing genuine though.  All so serious.  I did feel that I got a good cardio workout, but not a very good weight training workout.
I bet you may love this video if you are a dancer, or even sort-of a dancer, but I am clumsy and I will stick to Joyce!!",1027987200,2,572,4.0265486725663715
