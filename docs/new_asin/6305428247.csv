1028045,5,6305428247,"Not an epic film, but a really, really great film.  Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Gillian Andersen turned in remarkable performances with characters that were truly believable, and all three were beautiful, beguiling women while doing so.  Molto bene'!  Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson also turned in notable performances and aside from some of the dialogue being a little corny, the story was warm and heartfelt, and even this old Marine found himself choked up on a few occasions.  It's a great film for children as well.  I heartily recommend this presentation for those that just want to come away feeling good.",1458259200,,617,5.009803921568627

1028047,5,6305428247,"What a great movie. It is entertaining and has a wonderful message. Each morning you wake up, you write your life story. It isn't written by someone else. You get to make the choice of what you will do today. This is a message that can't be said enough. We grow by breaking out of our comfort zone. Max is repeatedly pushed from his comfort zone and sees what the results can be. It isn't always perfect and good trumps evil maybe a little more than in real life, but it's about hope and about keep on keepin' on. The acting is great. Elden Henson portrays Max and all the emotions so well that the viewer really understands this character and feels everything he is feeling. ""A knight proves his worthiness by his deeds."" a phrase by Kevin, ""The Freak,"" sums up the takeaway of this movie. Also a great movie about friendship.",1457740800,2,827,4.411764705882353

The two young actors who carried the movie did an excellent job and the supporting actors were well cast in their roles.  I loved Gillian Anderson's facial expressions.  She really played against type and added a lot of interest to the plot.  I loved Sharon Stone as Mrs. Dillon.  This is my favorite character of hers.  The movie tugged at the heart strings and I loved the theme of King Arthur's Knights and being reminded that a ""knight proves his worthiness by his deeds"" that was woven into the contemporary story.  The splendor of the knights clothing as well as their war horses were impressive to see.  It's a great movie for all ages and I highly recommend it.  The author of this story wrote a fantastic book.",1457222400,,837,4.411764705882353

1028263,5,6305428247,"This is a great parable that transcends the literal story.

We all have a disability, not able to think as clear as we want, perhaps not so smart in our decisions. But we earthlings who are feeble minded can, through willingness and obedience, allow our Lord to be our head and to lead us, as Kevin did when Max took him upon his shoulders. And in our weakness, we are surrounded with the saints of God's kingdom, who walk beside us (the knights) to help and encourage us in our quest: ""You will be brothers, said King Arthur. And you will fight for all those who ask for help. You will be gentle to the weak, but terrible to the wicked."" - because ""A knight proves his worthiness by his deeds"", and we can do together what we cannot do alone.

Carlotta, the object of Pennywhistles admiration, is a strong, capable, independent female who exemplifies great sensitivity to a womans point of view. It is refreshing to see a heroine who is competent and not a mere damsel in distress who exists simply to be put in jeopardy and then rescued. The endearing chemistry between hero and heroine leaves you in constant fear for the survival of their future.

Freak doesn't entirely have the right look, and maybe a more contemporary adaptation might employ more special effects to give it to him, but his characterization is good.

The majority of movies today do NOT have these three essentials for a movie to get 4 or 5 stars from me: character development; a moral message; and a story that makes you think about your own life's direction and purpose.  The friendship that developed between two opposites - both physically and mentally - is a thing of beauty!  This movie illustrates that within every human being, regardless of their handicaps, there is an innate goodness.  The friendship between these two 'misfits' (by our hedonistic, ego-worshipping society's standards) brings out the best in each of them.

Now in this movie it's about Kevin and max and how they went on adventures.

1030765,4,6305428247,"This film could have easily ended up like a typical ""disease of the week"" movie on Lifetime. Instead, it's more of a serious look at relationships and friendships and how most everyone we deal with in our lives has an impact, big or small. It also points to the power of the written word.

All of the actors give fine performances, especially Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin as the two young misfits. Sharon Stone hits the mark. Gene Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton give their usual best. Fans of ""The Sopranos"" will appreciate a brief appearance by James Gandolfini. The big surprise for me, as an ""X Files"" fan, was Gillian Anderson's role - a real turn from her usual ""sophisticated lady"" roles...made even more extreme by having Meat Loaf as her significant other. Loaf is good, too.

A very satisfying ending. You may cry, but along with the tears should come some peaceful inspiration.",1413072000,,890,4.735483870967742

The characters are portrayed well by the actors, especially Henson and Culkin. The movie is touching, humorous, and heart wrenching. I guess the biggest thing I can see as a negative is the cheesy southern accents some of the actors used.  As a southerner, born and raised, cheesy southern accents are a bit like fingernails on a chalkboard ( I guess the younger generation doesn't understand that reference though).

1032039,5,6305428247,"Almost as touching and heartwarming and funny as the novel.  The movie really captures Freak the Mighty well, losing very little of what makes the novel so special.

This is a tale that all ages will enjoy.  It is a story that all types of people can relate to.  It tugs at the heart, makes you think deeply, and gives you plenty of smiles.  The Mighty is a tribute to all those who are/were bullied, look different, think differently, love an odd group of friends, or struggle to be parents--single or otherwise.

The acting is spectacular.  The plot keeps you watching till the very end--no boredom allowed.  The characters are pretty well fleshed out too.

WATCH IT.  AFTER you read the incredible novel Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick.

It's so good that you may find yourself gifting the movie and novel to your closest friends and loved ones.",1407888000,,853,4.657718120805369

Movie stars Sharon Stone, Gillian Anderson (X-Files), Meatloaf, Kieran Culkin, James Gandolfini, Harry Stanton, Gena Rowlands and Elden Henson.  This tells the story of a strong friendship between a young boy, Kevin, with Morquio's syndrome and an older boy, Maxwell, who is always bullied because of his size. Adapted from the novel, Freak the Mighty, the film explores a building of trust and friendship. Kevin, an intelligent boy helps out Maxwell to improve his reading skills. In return, Kevin wants Maxwell to take him out to see the fireworks. Being the social outcasts of the town, Kevin and Maxwell come to realize that they are similar to each other and accept that they are ""freaks"" and nothing will stop them.

There are lessons to be learned, such as trust, friendship, and integrity.",1407628800,,877,4.918918918918919

1032392,4,6305428247,"From the book ""Freak The Mighty,"" the movie version features Sharon Stone, though slightly miscast here (her acting makes the grade, but perhaps other actresses would've been a better fit for her role), as the mother of 13-year-old ""Kevin"" (admirably played by Kieran Culkin) aka ""Freak,"" who is crippled with a progressively debilitating disease.  His Dad is out of the picture, so when Kevin and his Mom move next door to young ""Max"" (impressively played by Elden Henson) and Max's grandparents, a one-of-a-kind friendship is born, and it turns out to be just what each of them needed (Max himself feels that he's a social outcast for being learning-disabled and also fatherless, at least for the time being, so their common bond is their friendship's strong foundation).  There are undeniable similarities to 1995's ""The Cure,"" but the cast collectively gives ""The Mighty"" (1998) an independent appeal, including Gena Rowlands (""Hope Floats"") and Harry Dean Stanton (""Pretty in Pink"") as Max's grandparents, who do their best to protect their grandson, for fear that his Father (played by the late James Gandolfini) will one day get out of prison (for murdering Max's mother) and come for Max, their last link to their daughter (in a tender moment, when Max fears he's turning into his Dad, his Grandma reassures him that he undoubtedly has his Mom's heart).  Even Gillian Anderson (""The X Files"") shows up as ""Loretta,"" the girlfriend of Max's father's old friend, ""Iggy"" (played by Meatloaf, making for quite a diversified cast), and can't help but feel compelled to help Max.  When Max's father is finally released on parole, he doesn't hesitate to get what he wants, giving Gandolfini his opportunity to show off his acting skills, and he doesn't disappoint (albeit with limited screen time), giving the movie's best performance (drawing comparisons to his ""no more Mr. Nice Guy"" role in 1993's ""True Romance"").

They TRULY cared for one another.  It was their disabilities that brought them together; Not their athletic ability; not the fact they were cheerleaders; they weren't in the same club...they had a disability and one needed the other.  Don't get me wrong.  My son was the star basketball player in high school and my daughter was a cheerleader.  I am in no way criticizing either group.  These two boys had a friendship like no other.  Their agenda was not only to help each other, but to help others.  It was a fantastic movie and a great one for teenagers to watch.  I strongly recommend this movie.  There is some violence, so I don't recommend for younger children, but 13 and up should see it.  Maybe they will learn a thing or two.",1406678400,,914,4.466666666666667

She was totally believable as the mother of a disabled but fiercely independent and smart son.  When Max's dad showed up, I looked him up too and I had just watched ""The Sopranos"" last winter.

The Mighty features 2 young freaks, one who looks like a hunchback and needs braces and canes to walk and the other has a learning disability and is filled with rage because his father murdered his mother.
They bond to survive the taunts and harassment dished out by merciless school bullies. Kieran Culkin and Eldon Henson inhabit their roles as the 2 tortured friends as does Sharon Stone as Kieran's mother. Even supporting roles shine because of strong performances.

The producers should have allowed the author to write the screen version.  The book features two boys, both of whom are handicapped in different ways, who formed a ""unit,"" Freak the Mighty, based on a deep bond of mutual needs.  The writer of the screen version, Charles Leavitt, completely misses the point of the novel.  He obviously did not understand the significance of how a great need finally met can form a strong relationship based on trust--""you are there for me and I am there for you.  Together we can discover and embrace the world.""  The movie had to make up hackneyed conflict scenes that were not in the story and not necessary to tell a good story. In fact, they spoiled it.

1034329,5,6305428247,"I understand it is un understated film for many, and as a owner of ""Simon Birch"" (yes I like that film), I feel that folks have under rated, appreciation of this film.  I can't speak for the DVD quality, because I don't have this movie (yet).  I still can talk about this movie from the perspective that this film is presented; as a person who was bullied, disabled, and needed some kind of mythos in life to parallel what I faced as a kid/teen.  I think most kids need this form of understanding in their life to feel empowered and not just pushed around (either by other kids or by parents), but to know that their lives have power in and of their own making.  Yes, Simon Birch does demonstrate this as well (""I know I was sent here for a reason""), but perhaps to the average person, too vague and too obscure.  Yes, I know that the 'knights of the roundtable' has been done (or over done for years) as the myth base, but you need only look at the size of Max to realize why he would choose king arthur as his myth.  It follows also the hero's journey of someone who reluctantly must face a journey they do not intend to go on, but come out vanquishing fears and saving their humanity...this is what Joseph Campbell talked about for some 80 hours at the Lucas ranch about; the importance of the hero's journey to mirror and parallel in our lives.

Is it realistic from a disabled perspective?  Well, not as realistic as it could have been, if they actually had used a disabled person to play in the movie (like they used a little person in Simon Birch), but then again, we can set that aside for a minute.  Was it realistic about finding out about one's family, etc?  Yes.  The bullying was pretty standard to what most people face (Simon Birch on the other hand, was less realistic to the time; Kids were almost killed by non disabled kids in school, if they could even try to attend. Most were sent to special education schools across town, where education was NOT taught, but coloring was the order of the day).  This was pre Ed-504 (1974), where equal access was simply not even considered (unless your parents did what mine did, lie to the school district and get me tested after passing two grades so they couldn't refuse me entrance to the school).

I think that if you go beyond trying to have a swashbuckling movie, but are owning it because of it's warmth, humor and understanding of folks that are clearly different, you will find Mighty, mighty.",1334707200,,2459,4.425720620842572

Elden Henson doing a drama movie such as this and then doing a comedy movie such as Idle Hands shows he has excellent acting range. Supporting characters such as Sharon Stone, James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands and more are all very well portrayed as well.
Add an amazing soundtrack by Sting and you've got a great movie.
There are only 2 special features but they are worth watching.
PLOT: The story basically is, a freakishly large boy who has a ""Dinosaur brain"" meets the new boy next door who although has physical defects, is very smart and a partnership forms where one becomes the brains and the other is the body or brawn. Keiran's character is slowly growing too big for his body and his health is diminishing rapidly. In the time they are together, Keiran teaches Elden to read (Knights of the round table) and learn to think and write for himself. This brings about the adventures they go on, helping people around Cincinnati. Throw in a violent, murderer of a father who is parolled which scares the entire family, while Elden worries he will be like his father and the morale of, ""We are not our fathers."" We can choose to be who we want to be, makes this a great movie.

Than he meets a boy who has a physical disability, lives next store and he handles him self with arrogant people in school.

1034394,4,6305428247,"The Mighty, the video version of Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick, sends a wonderful message to all who see it.  Of course, my recommendation is to view the movie after reading the book on which it is based.  I showed this movie to my special education class for severely emotionally disturbed students after we read the book.  My students laughed and cried and cheered at times.  The friendship between two outcast children seemed to heal the spirits of both.  The memories of that friendship will sustain the Mighty--for the rest of his life.  Freak enjoyed the last months of his shortened life going on quests and medieval fantasies with his buddy--the big guy.  Neither played to the other's weaknesses and both played to the other's strengths.  What a wonderful movie for everyone to see.  My only criticism is that the Hollywood people--trying to be so politically correct I am sure---altered the name.  They should have left Freak The Mighty as it was.",1238112000,,964,4.858895705521473

Max has lived with his grim grandparents since the time that his father murdered his mother, and leads a painful existence at school. He rarely emerges from his basement room, terrified that he's too stupid and huge, and most importantly, that he takes after his homicidal father.

When Kevin moves next door, Max only wants to be invisible and is humiliated when Kevin becomes his reading tutor. But the unexpected happens: Kevin introduces Max to the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and Max begins to harness the power of imagination. The two work out an arrangement where Max serves as Kevin's legs, and Kevin as Max's brain. The two are involved in several hair-raising adventures and flights of fancy until an unexpectedly violent event that changes both their lives. The screenplay stays fairly close to the original novel, which is a huge plus.

The Mighty is a prime example of an all-star cast used to full advantage. Kieran Culkin, even though able-bodied, does an admirable job as brainiac Kevin without becoming a caricature of his disability. Harry Dean Stanton, Sharon Stone, James Gandolfini, Gillian Anderson, and Meat Loaf all put in memorable performances. Sting also contributes the obligatory theme song, topping off a soundtrack drenched in Renaissance Faire Celtic stylings.

I'm just going to say that this film was very enjoyable to watch, and certainly worth an evening.  This is more than a message film, that the least of us have worth, that good can triumph over evil, that one person's shortcomings can be filled by another's strength.
The Mighty is all of that, but it is entertaining as well.  There are life lessons to be learned here, for sure, but the inventiveness and imagination of Kevin, the disabled boy, brings a touch of whimsy and light humor to the film that might be unexpected.
It may not follow the book (which I have not read) closely, but it stands on its own as a sweet film that doesn't lay a message on too heavily, but, with the help of an excellent cast, strikes just the right balance between humor, drama, and pathos.

1034662,4,6305428247,"How in the HELL did this movie get lost in theatres? Why didn't every critic in America tell the world to see it?
I remember when I first heard that this book, FREAK THE MIGHTY (by Rodman Philbrick), was going to be made into a movie and that Gillian Anderson was going to play a small role. Well, I went ahead and read the book because (a) I'm an X-Files fan, and (b) I wanted to know what so drew her to the project that she was willing to play a less than a major role.
The book just tore me apart-- it wasn't just that I'd been a misfit myself in my youth, but the fact that it dealt with sometimes amazing, sometimes painful situations in such a clear-eyed way, never pandering to or underestimating the intelligence of the reader.
This film, while not adhering to the book to the letter (but damned close) kept the SPIRIT of the book intact, and for that I credit not only the director and screenwriter but the cast. Everyone involved seems to be most concerned with truth-- not is it dramatic, is it sad, is it funny, but is it HONEST?
While I credit all involved parties with making this film work so well, I have to say that NONE of it would have worked had it not been for the two leads, Elden Hensen and Kieran Culkin. These two ASTOUNDING young men are so utterly concerned with their characters as human beings that there is not a single false note in either performance. Going in, Culkin has an additional challenge/handicap-- the wiseacre type honed by his brother Macauley might well have been expected here, given the no-apologies intelligence that characterizes Kevin/Freak. But Culkin has no interest in just getting laughs-- he seems entirely aware that there are more important treasures to be had from this material.
That's not to say that there aren't moments that make you smile or yes, laugh, but they happen through the comedy of CHARACTER, not situation. There are no cheap emotions on the screen, nor do they try to elicit them from the viewer. When you laugh and cry at this movie, it is because you feel a PART of the proceedings, not that this is something put in front of you merely to entertain. It is obvious why such stellar actors (Anderson, Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, James Gandolfini) were drawn to this project-- there is more than enough well-drawn, intelligent material to go around, even to the smallest of roles. I also felt that the film improved on the novel by giving it a bit more an ending; the book just kind of STOPPED, and I was glad to see a bit more resolution. These characters deserved it.
I give the film 4 stars rather than 5 because of (a) the all-too-real violence and threatened violence seems jarring at times (as it did in the book as well) and (b) the lack of extras on this edition (a truncated behind the scenes featurette and NO commentary tracks, which is positively CRIMINAL given the talent involved).
So even though neither the film nor the presentation (although the music video by Sting is kind of fun) is perfect, do NOT let that dissuade you from seeing this film. You will not see its like again soon.",1057881600,67,3098,4.51423487544484

1034695,5,6305428247,"This movie, touching, inspiring, in parts amusing, and adventurous, tells the story of two boys, who don't fit in , and their adventures based on the credo of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table , to always champion right and good , to be gentle with the weak , and terrible to the wicked. Ultimately it tells of the treasury of their deep friendship.
Elden Henson plays Max Caine, a gentle giant, who is illiterate and seemingly simple, and a social outcast.
Kieran Culkin plays Kevin, a severely disabled boy, with a sharp mind and sharp tongue, who has created a fantastic world of books, words and ideas.
He befriends Max, and together they embark on a series of adventures, while having to overcome the local lowlives and a villain from Max's past.
Both young actors give a sterling performance
Sharon Stone shows her versatility as an actress, as Kevin's incredible mother. While this is a very different role, to some of the other stuff she has done, she fits the role as Kevin's beautiful young mother perfectly, and is as just as unforgettable and gorgeous in this part",1050796800,6,1084,4.680628272251309

Both learn from each other the importance of friendship and the values of honor, bravery, helping others, and accepting yourself. The cast works really well in all the roles, and all of the acting is very good (especially from the young actors). Sharon Stone surprised me in that she played the role of Kevin's mother well. The end of this movie was so sad despite being a bit predictable, but I thought it was beautifully done although I wished it ended differently, but then I realize how it completes the story. All in all, I found this movie really enjoyable in every way. The characters are endearing, the music is touching and the story is at times humorous yet very touching.

1034697,4,6305428247,"I enjoyed this film from start to finish, and was bowled over by the performances of the young actors. Based on a children's book, 'Freak the Mighty', the film manages to portray the challenges and friendship of two special young people without being patronizing.
Max, played brilliantly by Eldon Henson, is a slow boy, big for his age, whose mother was killed by his father, who is now serving a prison sentence. Max is being raised by his grandparents, the appropriately weary Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton. Max has failed 7th grade twice, and is the butt of teasing and jokes. His life is changed when Kevin, played by Kieran Culkin (Macauley's more-talented younger brother) moves next door with his single mother, well played by Sharon Stone. Kevin is physically disabled, with a degenerative bone disorder. He has compensated for his disability by being a genius. He is also stronger than Max, the only thing he lacks is Max's physical strength. The two work together, with Max being Kevin's legs, and Kevin being Max's brain.
The world can be an empty place for people who are ""different"", and Max learns and grows from his friendship with Kevin. The movie never resorts to cheap sentimentality, and this was one of the first films to make me cry in a long time. I don't agree with the criticism that Sharon Stone is too attractive to be Kevin's poor mom. All kinds of people have children with disabilities. There was no need to make Sharon Stone less beautiful, since this film is about the boys, and she is the mom, a supporting role, and her good looks are not really an issue.
I was disappointed in Gillian Anderson's performance as a white trash biker chick. She seems to be borrowing from the Sandy Dennis school of facial twitches, and feels a need to resort to a southern accent to emphasize that her character is from the wrong side of the tracks. Other than that, the movie is excellent, particularly the performance of Eldin Henson, who has a great future ahead of him.",1040515200,13,1995,4.702857142857143

Well, it's kind of like those lifetime movies. (You know, the ones which are high on sentmentiality and low on quality.) Not that I'm against emotional movies...I actually love them, when they work. See, the film tries too hard to make you sad. It seems too fake. Not that the acting is horrible. It's just that the film takes you to one touching moment, to another, and then another, and so on.  It just seems fixed, and once you start feeling this then the film has no emotional impact on you at all. And the whole sun plot involving Gandolfini was not needed, and didn't fit in well with the overall story. And the whole knights thing was cute at first, but then became too distacting.

1034766,4,6305428247,"The Mighty may not be destined to become a classic, but it scores a lot of points for dealing insightfully with the offbeat theme of two kids who use imagination to overcome the bad hands life has dealt them. It has a lot of heart [I know that sounds corny!] and even more soul.
Maxwell Kane [Elden Hensen] appears to be the dumbest kid in Cincinnati. He is easily the biggest student in seventh grade because he has failed it twice. Despite his size, he is quiet and passive. He lives with his grandparents, whom he calls Gram and Grim. This is not a happy house. Its inhabitants are haunted by the past.
Into the neighborhood come Kevin Dillon [Kieran Culkin] and his Mom [Sharon Stone]. Kevin is suffering from a rare disease which has caused him to become a virtual cripple and has given him a hunchback. He is extremely intelligent, has a sharp sense of humor as well and lives in a dream world.
The boys' first two encounters do not go well at all. When Maxwell is sent to remedial reading class, he finds to his embarrassment that Kevin, who is two years younger, is his tutor. But Kevin turns out to have a great deal of patience and decides that Maxwell must read King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable. He says that words are part of a picture, sentences are pictures, and imagination puts the pieces of the picture together. It is through imagination that the bond is formed.
One night at a fireworks display, where little Kevin can see nothing, Maxwell impulsively hoists him onto his shoulders. From that moment on, this becomes the way the two travel together. Kevin is the brains, Maxwell is the strength, and in their own strange way, they become one. Together they can get through almost anything. They have many experiences and adventures. These are all very real. Some are dangerous and scary, but in their heads, they have become a knight called Freak the Mighty. In the end, both must confront their separate demons, but because of their friendship, they are able to handle them.
The adults in the cast play second fiddle to these remarkable young actors. One or both of them are on screen in nearly all the movie. These are difficult roles. Kieran Culkin seems to be on track to become the actor his brother, Macauly Culkin, once seemed destined to be. Elden Hensen is equally serious about his career.
It is difficult to categorize The Mighty. Its themes are too mature for most children, and many adults do not like movies about children. The subject matter might at times be considered grim, yet there is a surprising amount of humor. I suspect that it is one of those films which will become cult favorites after a decade or so.",1016755200,2,2661,4.580712788259958

It also follows the book very well, and the book and the movie (for me) are exactly the same on the ""I Love This Story/Movie!""
Meet Max Kane. Max is a mentally slow boy,but huge in size. The son of a murderer who killed Max's mother, Max is the only witness to the murder. Max's father is put in jail. Max then lives with his grandparents for years. Max then meets Freak, who's his age but very small. He had a birth defect, and was born very small. But Freak's very bright. More of a genius, really. The two slowly become best friends, fighting villans and saving damsels (sorta).
The only problem I gad with this movie was how everyone said how Sharon Stone was the star of this movie and blah blah blah, when she only actually had about three scenes in the entire movie, with about ten lines total. To me, Kieren Culkin and Elden Henson were the real stars of this movie. Great job, guys!

1034821,5,6305428247,"Oh wow.  I fell in love with this movie from the moment the music started to play.  The music is Celtic, and it's really outstanding.  But it's Eldan Henson and Kieran Culkin who really steal the show.
The film starts off with Max Kane (Henson).  Max is in 7th grade, but he is at least two feet taller than everyone else in his grade.  He is always being teased by bullies for his size, his illiteracy, and his infamous father.
Then a kid named Kevin Dillan (Culkin) moves into the neighborhood. Kevin is also in 7th grade, but he is very small and has a birth defect that forces him to walk on crutches.  He is also extremely smart.  Bullies tease him, too.
Soon, Kevin and Max became inseparable friends.  Max became Kevin's legs, and Kevin became Max's brain.  By themselves, Max and Kevin were just freaks of nature who were always teased.  But when they are together, they are called ""Freak the Mighty""!  And then what happens is.....what, did you really think I'd tell you what happens next?
The script in this movie is absolutely adorable.  Here are some of the quotes:
--""So you're a pacifist.....yeah, a pacifist. You know, 'pass on the fist'?""
--""I said, you're a cretin!.....yeah, a cretin!  C-R-E-T-I-N!  Look it up in the dictionary and you'll find your mugshot!""
--""My father was a magician.  He heard the words, 'birth defect', and disappeared.""
--""Don't think of it as a friendship.  Think of it as a partnership.  You need a brain and I need legs.  And the Wizard of Oz doesn't live in South Cincinnati.""
--""Every word is part of a picture.  Every sentence IS a picture.  All you do is let your imagination connect them together.....if you HAVE an imagination, that is.""
Plus many more.  The above quotes were all said by Kevin Dillan.  But my favorite quote is the last line of the movie. You won't forget it for a while.
The script is hilarious.  The music is catchy.  The acting is all top-notch.  And the ending is so tragic.....it all adds up to a truly unforgettable film.  If you have a psyche, you will love this film.  Watch it ASAP.
P.S. Yes, I am only 14 years old, but parents shouldn't be too concerned about the PG-13 rating.  There's no sex, no nudity, no drug content, no profanity, and almost no on-screen violence.  Little kids may be frightened at times, but this movie is overall no more inappropriate than the PG-rated ""Simon Birch"".  If your kids have seen ""Simon Birch"", then they can--and MUST--see ""The Mighty""!
P.P.S. Does anyone know that Eldan Henson was actually 20 years old at the time he starred in this movie?",992908800,35,2560,4.599557522123894

Elden Henson plays Max, a big kid for anybody's standard, but huge for an 8th grader, who thinks he is quite stupid, and lets everybody else believe that also. There is a group of really mean boys while Max and they are in Gym class playing basketball, the mean boys play ""bowling for cripples"", and aim for Kevin, and just like bowling ball pins: down he goes, and Max gets blamed for it. Max gets detention, and he is assigned to a tutor to help him read. As it turns out, his tutor is Kevin, which is noticed by both of them. The book that Kevin has Max read is ""King Arthur and his Knights""... Max stumbles around reading, so Kevin tells Max this: ""Every word is a picture. Every sentence is a picture. All you do is let your imagination connect them together."" {I actually had to get my DVD into action just to get that quote directly from Kieran!} Max begins to realise that reading is more than just words... Kevin and Max, are at a Festival where there are fireworks, and Kevin cannot see the fireworks as he is so short. Max, realising that Kevin cannot see them, picks him up and places him on his shoulders to watch the spectacle... Once the show is done, the bullies see Max and Kevin, and Kevin accuses the lead bully of being a cretin, and the bullies react, and to give chase and to attack them. Kevin, with foresight, kicks Max into moving and together they become Knight and Steed (Kevin the Knight with Max as the Steed) and manage to avoid the bullies, and get them picked up by the cops... From this, a friendship forms, with Kevin getting Max to become more and more like one of Arthur's Knights... Kevin teaches Max to strive for everything. This movie is great.

Max lives with his kind grandmother - his father had been put in jail several years ago. When Max starts doing poorly in school, he has to get a tutor. The tutor ends up being a 14-year-old disabled, but intelligent boy in Max's school named Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin). Kevin feels like an outcast because of his disabilities. At first they do not get along very well, but soon they become best friends, when they realize that they are just as strong as everybody else when they unit as one. Sharon Stone plays Kevin's kind mother, Gwen Dillon, who takes care of Kevin while Kevin's father is also in jail. Gillian Anderson (""The X-Files""), plays a woman named Loretta Lee, who helps Kevin and Max in the end.
The only reason why people may think Sharon Stone is the main star in THE MIGHTY is because she is the most famous out of the cast. But she is only in like, a few sceens. It's Kieran Culkin and Elden Ratliff who are the REAL main stars. Though the whole cast gives surpurb performances, Kieran Culkin and Elden Ratliff's performances really shine.
This film should really have been more commercially advertised, because it is a great film many people missed out on. Ignore those snobbish critics who snubbed this film, because THE MIGHTY is really a wonderful film. The script is fantastic, and so is the scenary. There was not a boring moment in THE MIGHTY.

1034824,5,6305428247,"I rented ""The Mighty"" on a whim.  I have never been more pleased with a spontaneous video rental.
The movie stars Elden Henson (aka Elden Ratliff, who you may have seen in The Mighty Ducks movies... he was the kid with the wicked shot) as Max, a slow 14 year old who is virtually a giant of a boy; and Kieran Culkin as Kevin, a child who has a dibilitating disease but an intellect advanced well beyond his years.  Don't let the movie box fool you - this is NOT a Sharon Stone movie.  In fact, Ms. Stone is in maybe 4 scenes, maximum.  Sure, her performance is ok, but this movie really belongs to Henson and Culkin.  Henson, to be frank, is excellent.  The character of Max has a wide range of emotions throughout the movie - pain, bewilderment, fright, joy, sadness... He never ""overdoes"" a scene.  He BECOMES Max.  Absolutely amazing.
Culkin isn't so shabby himself - and let's be honest here, he's the REAL actor in his family.  He plays the role of a boy who knows that sooner or later, he's going to die - but lives life to the fullest.
Ok, this IS a ""feelgood"" movie.  But it's the best of its kind (forget ""Simon Birch"", please... besides, this movie was finished way before ""Birch"" was released.  Miramax screwed up royally be releasing ""The Mighty"" late, and not promoting it enough).  The imagery is awesome, and Henson and Culkin have great chemistry together.  I can't wait to see more of these two (and it looks like we'll at least get to see more of Henson... he has 3 movies coming out this year).  Do yourself a favor: rent ""The Mighty"".

Both films were made with the same subject matter, the old giant and small-man storyline. The film is mainly focused on two boys, Max- who is huge (could probably kick any bully's behind in thirty seconds flat), but- as he describes it- has no brain. Despite his large stature, a lot goes over Max's head. The second boy is Kevin (Kieren Culkin), a small boy inflicted with a serious and deadly disease. The boys begin what would be a strong alliance- you see, Kevin has a brain, and Max has legs.  Yup. They soon become basically one with eachother, embarking on childhood adventures centered around King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table type fantasies.  They run into thier nemesis, however, when they find a wallet stolen from a biker chick livin' with her biker bad boy boyfriend- Loretta Lee (Gillian Anderson). Anderson proves to us that she can move away from her 'X-Files', flashlight toting persona for this wacky, 'far out' role. She is bearly recognizable, but enjoyably so.  Anyways, Loretta's biker dude boyfriend just happens to be a serious problem for the boys.... but I'm not going to say anything else- wouldn't want to spoil it.

1034933,5,6305428247,"A very moving film, which make us enter in a world of dreams,through the sight of two young boys rejected by the others. As we could believe it, it isn't a innocent film at all,because the different symbols in it can be  decripted only by those who know how to dream. Gillian Anderson, one of the  best actress in the world, has a very funny part( a role very far from Dana  Scully)and I loved her in it. Sting's song, FREAK THE MIGHTY, really worth  it too.

I have not read the book yet, but about 30 mins before I wrote this review I ordered the book and the movie, and I cant wait till  it comes. Im 16, I have a 3.9 GPA in High School. I don't have any learning  defects or anything of that sort, and I STILL loved this book...I say this  because I see a lot of reviews from teachers or something in that realm who  teach 10,11,12 year old children...Im 16, great GPA, and I still loved it.  So even if you think this book is above you, its not. Everyone should read  it, ESPICALLY young children. I reccomend buying this movie very much, and  if the book goes well, which I think it will, Ill recommend that, too!",952214400,3,754,4.02013422818792
1034935,4,6305428247,"We really liked the movie The Mighty. We liked the action scenes such as the sled ride, the fight in the alley and the carnival, and when Kevin rescued Max.  We thought it was funny the way the two boys stood up to  everyone, the way Kevin created different characters wearing food, and how  he made up names for people. There were many themes in the movie. For  example, there was friendship, heroism, and Medieval Times.  This is a good  movie for all ages.",951264000,10,459,4.404761904761905
1034936,1,6305428247,"I was highly unimpressed with The Mighty.  Here we have another 'strong friendship between two outcasts and one of them dies' movies, which I believe is a difficult genre to do well.  The problem is that the  friendship doesn't start until after the movie begins, and 2 hours (or  however long it was) is too short to develop that.  If you want to see a  movie with the same general idea that is done well, rent 'Simon Birch.'  One reason it does well, aside from its strong story line, is that the  friendship is already established and the viewers can get on with the  events of the plot.  Acting was decent at best in the movie.  Many times  it looked prefabricated, such as the sewer scene and the ambulance scene.  And the knight motif got real old, real fast.  There's plenty of other  movies worth your dollars out there-don't waste them on this one.",949104000,4,857,4.474025974025974

1034969,5,6305428247,"I can't say enough about The Mighty!  I have never seen this kind of friendship and mutual credence displayed in film before.  Kieran Culkin gives a humdinger performance as Kevin Dillon and absolutely stole my heart  with a funny-tragic cafeteria-eating scene.  Eldon Henson is also terriffic  as Max the big friend.  This film teaches values about friendship, sacifice  for those friends, and, above all: Chivalry.  I loved the knight motif.  The film teaches that we are all a little different, but if we can put  those differenced behind us, and help each other, instead of harm we can be  world-conquerors, just like the knights of old.  This film should be seen  by absolutely everyone and was barely released theatrically.  I didn't get  the chance to see it in the theater but I saw it on Stars! tv and can  hardly wait to see it again & buy the video.  Only negative:  It's a  little too short.  Only 100 minutes.

1034970,5,6305428247,"The people who made this movie obviously have a very powerful sense of knowing what is right and what is wrong. This movie has good guys and bad guys. The good guys are always shown in a sympathetic light. The bad guys  always get what's coming to them. Actions have consequences. This movie has  a very strong moral center, and it is exactly what children need to see. I  think that it is absolutely absurd that the MPAA gave this movie a PG-13  rating. This movie was designed with the intention of being seen by people  of all ages. As a 28 year old man, I have never once cried while watching a  movie, but this movie is the closest that I have ever come. This movie  needs to be seen by children. And it especially needs to be seen by  children who are ""different,"" and who get teased a lot. It also  needs to be seen by adults who had experienced such teasing in their youth.

I suppose someone thought the term 'freak"" to be deragatory; however, after seeing this sleeper, I'd be  proud if someone thought I had those rare and wonderful characteristics  Kieran Culkin's character, ""Freak,"" displayed in this film.  I  don't ever remember this movie coming to Honolulu (so much for the  ""Coming soon to a theater near you"" slogan!), but I was thrilled  when it was released on DVD.  I rented, and sat at home alone watching it  one evening after work.  I rented it again three days later when my  girlfriend was over so she could see it, and loved it even more the next  time.  I've ordered the DVD from Amazon (it should be here tomorrow!), and  plan on sharing it with as many of my friends as possible.  This is as  touching and heartwarming a film as I've seen in years.  It is destined to  become a classic -- it has lessons that all our children should learn,  hopefully before they're too old to be shaped by the story.  With little  violence, almost no foul language, a marvelous soundtrack (featuring the  title song by Sting) and an outstanding ensemble cast, you cannot go wrong  with this film.

7889215,5,6305428247,"THE MIGHTY is an inspiring story about being different and not always needing to fit in. Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) aka the Freak moves in next door to Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson). Kevin  is handicapped and Max is large for his age and somewhat oafish. The two boys form a very unusual alliance as Max  becomes Kevin's legs and Kevin becomes Max's brain. The two work in unison and form a bond as they dream of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.

Here is a sweet and moving story about friendship and what really matters in life. Both boys suffer inner demons and Kevin encourages Max to read and think and dream. Of course, enter the school bullies--who are beyond mean and actually criminal. Kevin and Max unite against the injustice of bullies and life.

A delightful aspect of this film is the cast. Here is a young Sharon Stone as Kevin's mother. Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton (two great actors) as Max's grandparents. Add in an out of character Gillian Anderson, Meat Loaf and a younger and vibrant James Gandolfini and it's an amazing cast. Elden Henson is remarkable as Max,
