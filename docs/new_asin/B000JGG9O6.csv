Anyone who teaches middle school kids can tell you--they have short attention spans.  You can show just want you want  the kids to focus on, pause, and talk about each section.  It's not the most exciting documentary, but it's ""kid safe.""  Obviously made for classroom use.",1364428800,,441,4.662337662337662
