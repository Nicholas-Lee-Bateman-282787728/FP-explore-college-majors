3173466,4,B0017LGQHM,"In my opinion, the movie really isn't as bad as everyone says; I've got one problem with it, and that is the actual footage of the Meerkats shown in the movie are just random Meerkats that basically happened to 'do what the film crew wanted them to,' and when they did, they edited the tape together to give us the movie. If the movie was actually filmed like the Meerkat Manor series in which the actual named Meerkats are being filmed in their lives, then the movie would have been much more pleasing.

Whoopi's narrative is a bit different from what viewers may be used to, but I think she adds something 'special' and different for the movie, since the movie IS a bit different from the series. It's a good 'prequel' to the series for someone who has never seen it.

I still favour the series over the movie, but the movie is still worth seeing if you love meerkats and are open-minded to a different narrator.",1214697600,9,914,4.434523809523809

I do not know how accurate the storytelling and filming actually are, but it doesn't matter.  This is a nice Mother's Day gift about a smart, brave, beautiful little animal and her huge, colorful family.

My only regret is that Sean Astin, the narrator of the original three seasons. did not provide the narration for this last film, dedicated to Flower.  Apparently Whoopie Goldberg is the narrator for the fourth season (the ""Next Generation"" pun inescapable, especially with Whoopi, to Star trek fans).  I would have preferred Sean Astin, but this does nothing to detract from the enjoyment of the film.  Buy it and give it to a favorite mother.",1214006400,2,770,4.795454545454546
3173468,1,B0017LGQHM,"SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH that we lost Flower and Mozart in season three, the show's producer, Carolyn Hawkins had to take Sean Astin from us, too. Fans had every reason to expect Astin to return to narrate future seasons - and specials such as ""The Story Begins."" He led us through Flower's life as a leader of her tribe. Why shouldn't we expect him to tell us about her pup-hood?
Apparently, we are wrong. A letter from Animal Planet advises that human meerkat management decided it was time for women to take over narration duties. Management - I read that ""marketing"" - wanted a lighter tone: ""With ... Flower's passing the show's producer wanted to signal a change for the Whiskers clan and felt the best way to do that was with a new narrator. When Meerkat Manor premieres ... Emmy-award winning Stockard Channing will lend a headstrong voice to the Manor.""
Nice call on the ""lighter tone"" for women, folks. Thanks bunches.
Here's the gripe. Why tamper with perfection? ""Meerkat Manor"" has become an Animal Planet icon. Ratings are heads and tails better than spin offs such as ""Orangutan Island"" and the, frankly, offensive ""Lemur Kingdom"" that cites its critters with stereotypical hip hop characteristics. Not a show I'd want children to watch.
I love Whoopi Goldberg, who narrates ""The Story Begins,"" the story of young Flower. I also enjoy and respect Stockard Channing, but neither have Astin's resonance. Couple Goldberg's voice with the saccharine sweet score that accompanies ""Story"" and you've got a nauseating 75 minutes to get through.
Meerkat fans should be sure to pick up season three with its incredible true life story and compassionate narrator, who leads us through the triumphs and tragedies of the Kalahari. Don't insult the journey with the new marketing. Do yourself a favor, too, and avoid ""The Story Begins."" Here, the story ends.

Choosing Sean Astin to narrate the series was brilliant.  Why he was not chosen to narrate this movie makes no sense.

This movie is a tribute to Flower, the matriarch of the Whiskers clan of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert.  It follows Flower from the time she was just a pup until she becomes the Matriarch of the whiskers Clan.

If you enjoy Meerkat Manor on Animal Planet, you have to get this movie.  I agree that Sean Astin, the regular narrator, would have done a better job narrating than Whoopi.
Highly recommended for fans of Flower, and Meerkat Manor the series.

3173478,5,B0017LGQHM,"I've read other reviews that said things like ""they aren't the real meerkats from the series."" Well, Flower, the star, is dead, so how can she be the real thing? They're meerkats, aren't they? You can't tell Flower from non-Flower, so what difference does it make? When they make biographies, it's never with the real person. And Whoopi Goldberg does a fine job and I'm not saying this because I'm a fan per se. I think all the narrators have been really good. It must be that people get used to the way it ""was"" and don't want anything to change. Well, if they were going to change anything, it should have been to keep Mozart and Shakespeare alive and well. I could not bear the pain that Mozart went through. But Flower had a much better life. I will warn you, however, without giving anything away I don't think: there are 3 tragedies. You'll be able to tell when they're coming and can speed ahead if you want. This one (Meerkat Manor) is VERY sentimental. And you would think Flower will be nominated for a Nobel Prize, or should be. But I love hearing/seeing everything about the Whiskers, so they had me at the packaging. By the way, they aren't cute enough? The picture on the cover is airbrushed!

3173480,1,B0017LGQHM,"First of all, I give troyacurtis71 five stars. The movie was very low cost and I recieved the package only 3 days later. Very good service.
However, the movie was terrible. Seriously, the producers butchered the idea of Meerkat Manor. It was fast paced and felt rushed. Also, Goldberg is a TERRIBLE narrator. Throughout the entire movie I felt like she was speaking to a five year old. Don't they realize Meerkat Mannor captured the imagination of more than young children? Also, she exaggerated certain details, making it feel less authentic and professional. I think it could have been a good movie if they used a better narrator, like Sean Astin. There's only a few good points about it: you learn about Flower's past, although I'm not sure how much of it is authentic. I've heard many controversies that some of the details depicted in the movie were inncorect. Although they used different Meerkats to produce the movie, the shots were great and some even adorable. There were WAY too many landscape shots though.
So if you want to see Flower's life in the big screen, and you can deal with the annoying narrator, this movie is for you. It gives you no reason to watch it again. If that's not something you want, I suggest you just look up and read Flower's story.",1392508800,,1269,4.669642857142857

Now as to the movie itself, it IS just recreated scenes from Meerkat Manor itself, if you've seen MM before you can see repeated scenes from the show, although Petal's death was something I hadn't seen before, I decided to buy the other seasons as I was getting tired of having to wake up so early in the am to watch it.",1372032000,3,495,4.221052631578948
3407984,5,B0017LGQHM,"This movie (The story begins) tries to describe the life of meerkats. The Seasons 1, 2 and 3, I agree, is a tribute to Flower, the matriarch of the Whiskers clan of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. But on the last season the film tries to continue the story with Flowers' daughter Mozart. They show the troubles of the clan without a strong matriarch as Flower.

The work of the reserarchers that make this movies possible was great. I like meerkats and I recomend this series.",1329782400,,477,4.546511627906977
3407985,4,B0017LGQHM,"Very well done documentary on the Meerkat family and how the ""tribes"" work.  It was very interesting to see how one family challenges another and the head of the family is actually a female.  This was a truly educational DVD.",1299974400,,225,4.6
3407986,1,B0017LGQHM,"I love the real Meerkat Manor - check out my review of season 3. But ""Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins"" is not what its title implies. It is not early footage from the beginning of Meerkat Manor. Instead, it is re-created footage, using different meerkats. It's like one of those re-enactment shows on TV. A total fraud. Not worthy of the name ""Meerkat Manor.""",1294704000,2,359,4.625

3407988,1,B0017LGQHM,"Whoopie Goldberg's presence overwhelms this movie and takes away from the Meerkats. Skip this movie. I LOVE the Meerkats, but this was not good.",1234656000,2,144,5.041666666666667
3407989,3,B0017LGQHM,"I agree with the other reviewers -- Sean Astin's narration is preferable to Whoopi Goldberg's.  But who really watches ""Meerkat Manor"" for the narration, anyway?  This story is all about Flower, the matriarch of the Whiskers meerkat clan.  If you were saddened by her death on the series, it's nice to watch this early video of her and her clan, as she journeys from very small and tragic beginnings to a still small (12"" tall) adult meerkat that is a force to be reckoned with.  It's hard not to put human traits on the meerkats -- loyalty, treachery, bravery, cowardice, love.  Perhaps humans don't have a monopoly on such things after all!  Rent or buy this for Flower.",1232409600,3,672,4.6525423728813555
3407990,2,B0017LGQHM,"Weak script, not enough real film footage and detail about Flower, skims and skips too much, not satisfying.  Not like the TV show of Meerkat Manor.  I bought the film to watch on my own time.  If I had known it wasn't worth it, I wouldn't have bothered to buy it.  Was a real fan of the TV show.",1215820800,3,296,3.9661016949152543
