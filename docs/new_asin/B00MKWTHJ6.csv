8672918,5,B00MKWTHJ6,This rating is for the original VHS release which I thought to be an excellent documentary on the history of The Beatles.  I still own the VHS copy but no longer use a VHS machine to watch it and would like to enjoy it again on DVD.  I'm hoping that someone can confirm if this DVD copy is of a high enough quality to justify the price?  Why so expensive?,1441843200,,355,4.042857142857143

8672921,4,B00MKWTHJ6,"This 1984 documentary account of The Fab Four featuring rare interviews and concert footage. Made a decade before the surviving Beatles Paul, George and Ringo produced The Beatles Anthology(1995). Narrated by Malcolm McDowell, who recalls the rise of The Beatles. Interesting interviews with Gerry Marsden and The Beatles first manager Allan Williams reminiscing on the early Liverpool Mersey scene and the legendary Cavern club which launched The Fab Four. Horst Faschner reveals the seedy world of Hamburg and the all nighters at The Star Club which would provide a valuable training ground for The Beatles. Rare footage of the Beatlemania hysteria first sweeping England, then onto awaiting screaming fans in America. George Martin provides the most insightful interviews of the process involved in the song writing techniques of Lennon/McCartney. Recounting his studio work and experimentation producing the groundbreaking masterpiece 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. After the death of manager Brian Epstein The Beatles were beginning to fall apart, embarking on their solo careers and a final 'swansong' rooftop concert before splitting. In George Martin's own words; ""I think the great thing about The Beatles, was they were of their time, their timing was right, and they left their mark in history because of that. They expressed the mood of the people and their own generation"". Also cast are: Tony Sheridan, Marianne Faithfulll and Billy Preston. The Compleat Beatles is a rare, revealing and riveting rockumentary of The Beatles.",1418601600,2,1549,5.485355648535565
