4172017,4,B003QTBSZS,"Unlike volumes 1 and 2, volume 3 in this series concentrates nearly exclusively on the monster movies of the thirties and forties, with just a little of the fifties and color thrown in. We get trailers featuring the usual suspects, aka Abbott and Costello, Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Mummy, as well as various brides, sons, houses of and so on. A few suprises include trailers for The Climax, The Canterville Ghost, Hangover Square, and Arsenic and Old Lace. Most clips look pretty good, some a little dark but some quite bright and clear. Extras do not include any old time radio shows like a previous volume, sadly, but do include Bela Lugosi's interview when he left the hospital after kicking his addiction in 1955, and, like the others in the series, an alternative all music track to listen to while watching the show. Oh, and if Vincent Price is in there, I missed him.",1323216000,6,893,4.730769230769231
4172018,3,B003QTBSZS,"This three dvd boxset contains heaps of old trailers from the 30's to the early 70's and the quality is not bad, however the only downside I found with it was most of these trailers have been overshown over the years and there are really no surprises here nor really outstanding ones.
These trailers look like they were just thrown in at random, still if this kind of stuff grabs you, grab it.
The extra features are a couple of old radio show highlights and an interview.",1293408000,5,472,4.436781609195402
4172019,5,B003QTBSZS,"While it is a shame that the product arrived damaged, it was quickly replaced and I am very pleased with it.

Content:

The collection is filled with fantastic trailers of both well known and lost cult gems of the golden age of horror movies. Though not digitally restored like they are on the Second Edition Universal Legacy Collection DVDs, their quality is just worn enough that they look great but are still watchable.

Packaging:

Honestly, it's flimsy. The box itself is wafer-thin and should be treated with care; its only purpose is to look cool as the box art is wonderful. The DVD cases are not much better. They too need to be opened and closed with care, and have fantastic box art. Their width is just under half of a regular DVD keep case so you can't transfer them to a blank one and slip the original DVD cover into the sleeve. But as long as you're careful nothing should happen.

Special Features:

Though Amazon claims there are no special features, there are. On volume no. 2, there is an alternative audio selection with a bonus music soundtrack, plus two old time radio horror pieces called ""The Creaking Door"" and ""The Strange Dr. Weird""; each roughly half and hour long. On volume no. 3, there is also an alternative audio selection with bonus music soundtrack, as well as an incredible interview with Belo Lugosi leaving rehab about battling with drug addiction in 1955. His words are very sobering and eye opening.

Overall Review:

This is a great collection that any fan of classic horror would love and want to add to their collection. If you have the time and the money, you can set it up to have all of these DVDs play on separate TVs to enhance the mood at your Halloween party. That's what I plan on using them for.

This is a unique collection that you won't find anywhere else and is worth the money. Highly recommend it.",1434326400,,1856,4.566265060240964
4172020,5,B003QTBSZS,"And that and the superb work of four star reviewer Michael H. , here-in listing all the trailers , sold me a copy of this wonderful set . As a streaming only household with Amazon Prime , Netflix and Warner Archive Instant among my arsenal of channels , I find this set thrilling and VERY helpful . It's one thing to pour over terrific film magazine quarterlies and monthlies , it's another (altogether) to look at these FUNtastic horror trailers . I can't get one , two or three trailers in without seeing if I can rent , stream , buy or otherwise come by one of these old titles . Even though I own ALL the Hammer titles , it's still a swell set for the old school horror/science fiction enthusiast reading this now .",1420761600,,719,4.294117647058823
4172021,4,B003QTBSZS,"The content of ""Festival of Fright 3"" is highly nostalgic of a time gone by...to hear the great Art Gilmore on many of these trailers, brings back a time when, going to the show, was an event.  Fun video...!!!",1401926400,,209,4.358974358974359
4172022,1,B003QTBSZS,"I was hoping more of the Something weird movie preview film, with a bit less camp. Abbot and Costello do not fit into a festival of fright to me.",1397088000,,145,4.0344827586206895
4172023,3,B003QTBSZS,"This is just what it claims to be, a stream of trailers fire classic horror films. I could see it playing in the background at a party or a club with a spooky theme, but probably not something most people would sit down and watch. I did enjoy seeing the different approaches marketers had to selling these films, especially being familiar with how many of the films actually played out. Many of the trailers were for the rerelease of some of the Universal classics. It's certainly worth a view to the die hard classic horror buff.",1397088000,,530,4.53125
4172024,3,B003QTBSZS,"First off the trailers that they picked for Festival of Fright 3 are pretty cool. It's nice to see the trailers for such classics as Dracula and Frankenstein. My only complaint is the picture quality of the trailers. Some aren't too bad, but some are too dark or just poor picture quality and obviously the trailers aren't in HD.",1382054400,,329,4.593220338983051
4172025,3,B003QTBSZS,"As a fan of old horror, Sci-Fi and B movies, it's a fun watch to see all these old trailers! Besides counting up how many you've seen, it's a peek into a by-gone era of advertising as they make claims that would never be allowed today. The most thrilling viewing experience ever to hit the screen ;)",1372636800,,299,4.2631578947368425
4172026,4,B003QTBSZS,I had no idea there were so many old time horror previews and this one is labeled as number 3. It was fun to watch and I would like to see numbers 1 & 2 as well.,1368662400,,161,3.3783783783783785

4172028,4,B003QTBSZS,"For some strange reason, the company found it necessary to put their logo at the bottom of the screen (just like on TV) throughout disc 2, which was a little distracting & annoying. Other than that, it's just like what the other reviewers have said.",1358553600,4,249,4.555555555555555
8402570,4,B003QTBSZS,Nice collection of B movies. I mainly bought the set because I was the co-writer of one of them.,1520380800,,96,4.105263157894737
8402571,4,B003QTBSZS,"This is a 3-DVD set consisting of dozens of trailers for old horror and sci-fi movies. There are trailers for classics but mostly it's a lot of obscure B-movies, which is fine. I bought this specifically to play on my TV for atmosphere at a Halloween party I hosted. I didn't even have the sound on (there was Halloween party music playing) but it was still perfect for enhancing the mood. For these events I used to put on a classic horror movie like ""Halloween"" or ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" but even with the sound off it kind of sucks people in. I wanted something that wouldn't necessarily draw peoples' attention away from the party, but would also show a constant stream of scary images (even if they are kinda cheesy). This is perfect for that! Also, some of the scenes from cheesier movies will get a good laugh from people who happen to be watching at that moment. While this set did exactly what I wanted it to, there is one reason I didn't give it 5 stars... I was hoping with 3 whole DVDs the trailers would start to show more films from the 70s and 80s. I guess those films would cause too many copyright issues. Anyway, this is perfect to put on in the background at a Halloween party or while you're decorating your house.",1505433600,,1240,4.395652173913043

8402576,4,B003QTBSZS,"All trailers and no fluff.

The quality is as good as you can expect from the original film sources.  These weren't high quality films when they were made, so don't expect Criterion editions of the trailers.  Just lean back and enjoy the cheese.",1469232000,,245,4.651162790697675
