while CHRISTMAS is a difficult film to categorize - this one is a formulaic romantic comedy/drama - but so full of surprises that is ranks at the top of the genre

this one's for people who like bickering love potentials - one is a soldier on leave from the army who is surprised to find his girlfriends apartment being occupied by someone else - while these two pine away for other people - they squabble as they collaborate over a screenplay about love

this is a south korean film - so you can't be sure everything will end happily

Lee Seong Jae - who plays the young man - was just starting out on a successful career - while the wonderful Shim Eun Ha would unexpectedly retire in a couple years despite being a top star not yet 30 years old

in supporting roles - korean film icon Ahn Sung Kee and pretty Song Seon Mi contribute as much as the stars do

not only does a DVD of this film reside alongside CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST in my personal library - but both crowd in with a handful of films at the very top of my favorites list",1279670400,2,1382,4.810126582278481
