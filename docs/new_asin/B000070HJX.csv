1800066,5,B000070HJX,"As a mother of four children and primary school teacher, I was very pleased to watch this video with my children.  The scenes are simple in design -- great for my kids who are easily over stimulated by too much noise and movement.  The music is soothing yet enticing and certainly enjoyed by both parents and children.  The peek-a-boo scenes bring squeals of delight and the scenes with balls, trains, teddy bears, and bubbles bring my toddler right up to the TV screen to join in the play.  This video is not high energy with lots of action that we typically see.  That makes it refreshing for the parents and siblings who will undoubtedly hear and see it over and over.",1034640000,5,671,4.512396694214876
7973935,5,B000070HJX,"As a former school teacher and social worker, I am always on the lookout for a video that not only entertains but also educates my young grandchildren (6 months to 3 years).  I am delighted that I discovered Start Smarter's Relax and Learn.  My grandchildren are entranced by the music that so perfectly accompanies the little cars, flying dolphins, bubbles and fish.  The children learn various shapes, colors, letters and beginning words.  They march around the room to the starting music but then their inner clocks wind down as they are lulled to a peaceful silence at naptime.  This is truly a five star video that you will be glad you purchased...I sure am!

7973936,3,B000070HJX,"Ho-hum.  Not really badly done, but neither our 1-year old nor we found this video particularly interesting, although he does zone in and out of parts of it.  Again, with the canned Mozart in the background! (Ah, yes, a snippet a day makes your child a genius, according to the latest research).  But the music is not really integrated in any way to the content, just slapped into the background.  Example of how the production values are poor, especially sound. And what's with the blocks spelling out the words?  In my view, a clever sop for anxious parents---in fact, no child young enough to sit through this mundane video is going to have a clue that b-u-b-b-l-e has anything to do with ""bubble."" Buy it if you have nothing better in mind.",1076457600,,744,4.606060606060606
7973937,5,B000070HJX,This is the second video that our son really enjoyed after Baby Mozart. He sat and watched the whole thing and seemed really into it.  I like that there are words here as well as music.  I also had a problem with the video itself and the company replaced it with no problem.  I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you,1054598400,4,319,4.19672131147541
7973938,3,B000070HJX,My boys - 10 months & 23 months - just didn't light up at this video the way they do when I play Baby Neptune or any of the Baby Bach series or anything with ELMO.,1053388800,,163,3.5555555555555554
7973939,5,B000070HJX,"I found this video in a gift shop outside of Atlanta and this is one of the only children's videos I have ever watched and listened to that I could actually tolerate.  Most of the baby and children's videos have annoying voices from the puppets or characters, like that purple Barney guy.  I can't even stay in the same room when he is on.  But this video uses classical music that more or less fades into the background and the sound effects are pretty cool and not overwhelming.  It has a nice woman's voice, and cute kid laughter.  Dads, if you are trying to find something that won't drive you crazy and right out of the room, try this one.
In addition, our 15-month-old boy is starting to say some of the words on the video.  When I say ""starting to say"" let me clarify and say he says the first syllable.  He loves this duck that quacks during the video and every time the music starts for the duck he runs up to the screen points at the duck, looks back at me, and starts to say ""duh, duh"".  I think that is pretty amazing as we have only had the video for three weeks.",1035331200,3,1076,4.189320388349515
7973940,5,B000070HJX,"As a mother and a professional, I am always looking for products that stimulate my children's minds. This video is not only cute and interesting to my children, but it is educational in the process. I am thrilled to have a video that can actually teach my children important words, add to their cognitive development skills, and at the same time, give me a guilt-free break to wash dishes, close my eyes, or to sit with them and enjoy the video myself. In addition, this video works better than any I have purchased to soothe my colicky child...and that's all a stressed mom can ask for!
The music is wonderful as well!
Highly recommended for infants, toddlers, and parents alike! Please keep me on your list for more videos to come!

7973941,5,B000070HJX,"My two children, ages 5 months and 2 1/2 years, love this video. My oldest one always requests to see it over and over again. The video is active enough to hold her attention with the various toys and peekaboo animals yet calming enough to watch at the end of the day as a wind down before bedtime. I really like the words taught throughout the video as well. My daughter also likes hearing the children's voices and giggles along the way. She laughs when they do. I am sure my five month old gives this video a thumbs up, too, if he could do that!",1035158400,,548,4.179245283018868
7973942,5,B000070HJX,"We are so excited to see a video that holds my toddler's full attention. Start Smarter is very educational as well as stimulating.  The video has wonderful music, upbeat yet also extremely relaxing.  We always let him watch it first thing in the morning as well as winding down at night. Some of our favorite segments are the peek-a-boo puppets with the sounds of actual children's laughter. My husband and I highly recommend Start Smarter.  Not only is it great for babies and children, but it is a great price as well.  It makes a great baby gift!  Absolutely five stars!",1034985600,2,573,4.633663366336633
7973943,5,B000070HJX,"Our children have had more hours of enjoyment watching the video.  It is both educational and entertaining.  Whoever developed this video did a great job and obviously knows what children enjoy.  This video appeals to both of our children who are three years apart.  Our three year old always chooses this movie and has watched it so many times!  Thank you for creating a video that makes us not feel ""guilty"" when our children are watching it!  Please make more!",1034899200,2,463,4.725
7973944,5,B000070HJX,"Our children, ages 5 months and 3 years, loved this video.  After seeing it for the first time, they picked it again and again.  They giggled at the puppets and learned things at the same time.  I highly recommend it.",1034726400,3,217,4.375
