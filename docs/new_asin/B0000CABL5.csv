1917002,5,B0000CABL5,"I hate reality TV.  I loathe it.  Reality TV consists of some of the worst shows in television history, like The Swan and The Littlest Groom.  However, these shows are so popular with viewers and with networks that scripted shows are cancelled in order to make room for more reality junk (The WB admitted that it cancelled its long-running show Angel because they needed more reality).  However, there is but one reality TV show that is not only good, it is one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen.
The premise of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment, or JKX, is that Jamie, the host of a million faces, goes into disguise to ""X"" unsuspecting people.  He has characters like Brad ""B-Rad"" Gluckman, the Jewish rapper from Malibu, a mobster who runs a pizza parlor, and Virginia Hamm, an African-American talk-show host.  Yes, Jamie not only dresses up as a black woman, he passes for one!  Kennedy is truly a master of disguise who can change his appearance and voice with ease.
The reason that this show works, despite its reality TV genre, is that Jamie isn't over the top, isn't shameless (most of the time), and he gives people what they want.  There are too many shows like Fear Factor where the whole idea is to gross out participants and viewers.  Sadly, I doubt that this show will ever be the first to come to mind when talking about reality TV in the future, but it sure deserves to be.
Some geat bits were the Spring Break jokes, the pizza delivery guy, the driving instructor, anything with Brad Gluckman, and the one where Jamie tried to X a fellow WB star.",1084665600,11,1569,4.535460992907802

1917004,5,B0000CABL5,"The ""Jaw Surgery"" bit alone made me laugh hard. This is a ""must buy""---I kid you not. ...--everytime you see it it will crack you up. And 3 DVDs worth---you have to watch them in moderation or you WILL DIE of laughter.",1081296000,,218,4.214285714285714

1917006,4,B0000CABL5,"It takes a great deal of nerve to take the old ""Candid Camera"" idea of filming unsuspecting people tricked by pranks, plaster your name on the name of the show, and then take that very old idea and call it an ""experiment.""  The only thing new here is how elaborate and well-planned the pranks now are. Some of these hoaxes must have taken months to plot and plan. The result is some pretty funny stuff. There is also a very lame trick of having Kennedy pretend to have jaw surgery and needing to have his mouth wired open. This pathetic stunt is repeated several times throughout the first season - which hints that they were running out of ideas even then. Still, some great, hilarious bits. But it isn't an experiment.  And it didn't start with Jamie Kennedy. Or Candid Camera (the idea was done on radio way back in the 1940's).",1072656000,3,831,4.4605263157894735
1917007,5,B0000CABL5,"If you like the Jamie Kennedy Experiment you must get this 3 DVD set...TODAY. It's a commercial-free compilation of the entire first season, and it's just hysterical. Hands-down - this is the funniest DVD I have ever seen!",1070409600,2,222,4.868421052631579
1917018,5,B0000CABL5,"WHEN I FIRST SAW HIS SHOW ON TV YEARS AGO I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SHOW. THE WRITERS, COSTUMES, SKITS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS SHOW YOU ARE HARD TO PLEASE. I BOUGHT ALL OF THE SEASONS YEARS AGO AS SOON AS THEY WERE AVAILABLE. SOME OF THE FUNNIEST IS WHEN HE PLAYS THE RAPPER, DRUNK WINE TASTER, SECURITY GUARD, THE MOB GUY JUST TO NAME A FEW. AFTER WORKING HARD ALL WEEK, I RELAX WITH SOME WINE A NICE STEAK, POP IN JAMIE KENNEDY AND LET THE LAUGHS BEGIN.",1283385600,,465,4.065217391304348
1917019,5,B0000CABL5,Awesome! I reallly enjoyed the first season of this show. Thank you Jamie where ever you are for the first season :-) Very solid acting on your behalf. I think the White rapper movie might have killed the show though :-(,1277683200,,220,4.390243902439025
1917020,5,B0000CABL5,"This hidden camera show is absolutely hilarious! Kennedy's unique comedy and varying characters are fantastic- my favorite is the driving instructor and all the dental surgery characters. You'll even see the original B-Rad, the rapper from the hard streets of Malibu who went on to make ""Malibu's Most Wanted.""",1183334400,,310,5.346938775510204
1917021,5,B0000CABL5,Jaime's Experimental show is howlingly funny.  The recurring rapper and judge skits are sheer genius.  I had sore abdominal muscles for a couple of days after watching the first season.,1180396800,,185,5.133333333333334
1917022,5,B0000CABL5,"season one is stellar. brad gluckman came from here (later to make the film malibu's most wanted) but the skits he appears in here are way funnier than the film. a trip to bob saggets on LA tours is sweet when jamie breaks into his house as ""part of the tour"". overall very awesome, only a couple skits i thought were just ok, over 90% of them are AMAZING! now i need to get season 2 and 3.",1156723200,,390,4.012820512820513
1917023,5,B0000CABL5,"The JKX has got to be one of the funniest hidden camera dvds available!!! Once you've watched it once, you'll be hooked...It's unlike MTV's PUNK'D only because Jamie Kennedy is genius enough to participate in all of his skits himself disguised as different personalities,anything from a yoga instructor, to a wise-crack judge, to a wine entrepeneur who's just had jaw surgery and still drinks wine with his mouth wired open!!! Guaranteed to have you laughing and coming back for more....A must-have for anyone with a sense of humor!!!!",1133308800,3,535,5.090909090909091
1917024,1,B0000CABL5,"This has got to be one of the worst shows of it's kind ever produced. How did this guy ever manage to get financing for this show? It looks like he had plenty of money to finance the show, but the thing was, in the end, the pay offs where pathetic.

That sketch he does where he's a fat women with a talk show.. whats funny about it? He pretends to be a women, fools the audience, says something stupid then takes the mask off... if the joke is finding out shes a he, then hardy har-har (sarcastic laugh) but it would be funny to actually do a prank, or some kind of a joke, not do something for real then all of a sudden reveal it's him. There is nothing funny about that at all.

This guy has no talent.",1118102400,2,705,3.99290780141844
1917025,5,B0000CABL5,"Wow!  I love this series!  I'll never forget the first time I saw this show!  Please join me on a journey, while I tell you about my favorite hidden camera show.

I happen to be flipping channels, and ended up on the WB, one Thursday night, about 9 p.m.  I saw Jamie Kennedy introducing a segment.  He was explaining about a new rapper sensation, named Brad Gluckman.  I was distracted, temporarily, by my young newborn son.  I began watching the segment, laughing my head off, and thinking Brad Gluckman was so funny.  Who was this guy?  It wasn't until the end of the segment, and Jamie made the reveal, that I realized Jamie Kennedy and Brad Gluckman were one and the same.  And I realized at that moment that I had found my new favorite Hidden Camera show!

After that I was hooked every Thursday.  I even converted some of my relatives and friends over to the Jamie Kennedy addiction.  I then began taping every show I could find.  Of course, I had a load of VHS tapes, after this.

When the DVD was announced, I knew that my prayers had been answered. I reserved this immediately, and bought it on launch day.  Now I can watch and rewatch my favorite episodes over and over again.

Some of my favorite episodes:

1) Jamie pretends to be a Yoga Instructor.  He gets into a pickle, when some outside workers don't take kindly to his cursing at them, and enter his Yoga studio seeking justice.  My favorite line:  when one of the actors is confronted by a rather large, burly construction worker he states:  ""I'm bigger than you, and stronger than you, and more powerful.  Hmmmmmm. (humming).  The large man then proceeds to toss his body into a metal door like a ragdoll.  (No, he was not hurt, he was a stuntman.)

2) Spring Break in Florida, and Jamie dresses up as a ""hot chick"" who very obviously wants to hook up with an unsuspecting male spring breaker.  Ohh, and its REALLY obvious Jamie is a ""dude.""  This, despite the mark's friend's (who's in on the joke) insistence that Jamie is not a dude, and to just stick it out.

3) Jamie plays a boss, interviewing a job candidate.  They are interrupted by Jamie's male boyfriend, actor A, who confronts him about his flirting with another male friend at a party.  Jamie is married, and of course his wife shows up to complicate matters.  The job candidate is then asked to pretend to be ""friends"" with Actor A.  Halarity ensues.

I could go on, but I don't want to spoil the fun.  I highly suggest you purchase this one.

Only complaint, would be, it would be nice to see more special materials, such as behind the scenes filming of the behind the scenes folks who make these gags works.  We rarely get a chance to see their side of the story. The commentaries are nice, but Jamie sounds half asleep (which he apologizes for on Season 2 DVD's commentary, see my review.)

All in all, very well done, and supper funny.  I like the outside jacket artwork and photos, and the disc covers as well.

Great job Jamie!",1100217600,8,2967,4.460820895522388
1917026,5,B0000CABL5,I've been hooked on Jamie since the first time I saw his show.  I watch it every week but I still got the set to keep for when friends who haven't seen them come over.  One important question........  Where's Season 2?????,1089504000,2,222,4.365853658536586
7998430,5,B0000CABL5,"I'm convinced Jamie Kennedy, a Gen Xer, requires his fans to also be Gen Xers or maybe it's just that his style of humor requires a certain taste.  My husband and I are Gen Xers and laughed hysterically, but my younger sister only found him to be only ""mildly amusing.""  I think this season was his best.",1500854400,,304,4.315789473684211
