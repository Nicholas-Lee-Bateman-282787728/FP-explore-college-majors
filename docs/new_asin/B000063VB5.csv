7959870,3,B000063VB5,There are no English under titles. This is playable on a Region 2 machine. Otherwise a well done visual recreation. There is a German version with Wunderlich and Fassbender from a 1962 performance in Munich that is more immediate. This version has more polish,1512345600,,259,4.909090909090909

7959876,5,B000063VB5,"I really enjoyed this version of Onegin.  It's more like a film than an opera.  Indexing between the booklet and the DVD is 1 off, and there is a glitch in sound between tracks 12 and 13, but it is still a grat production.  And I didn't have any problems navigating to Act II or Act III.  What surprised me, the native Russian speaker, is that non-Russian singers sing in almost perfect Russian language.",1056585600,16,404,4.418918918918919
7959877,4,B000063VB5,"I love this. It's true that the tracks don't go where they're supposed to but I watch opera all at once. This is a film, not a stage version, and the natural settings are wonderful. The acting is very good --- the actors are NOT the singers, which I found a bit strange initially --- and the singing is excellent. THe characterisations seem very good to me. There are some cuts, which I miss: in particular at the start when Tatyana's mother and nurse sing about their acceptance of their lot, and again when her nurse speaks of her young (arranged) marriage to Tatyana. I think these are odd omissions, since this is part of the important theme for Tatyana. I would recommend this dvd.",1034812800,17,686,4.496
