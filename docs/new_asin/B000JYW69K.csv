8153673,5,B000JYW69K,"This DVD is a tremenduous introduction to a vanishing form of entertainment, the traditional traveling circus -- the real deal, with animals, and not some grandiose theatrical technical production that typfies the nouveau cirque we see so much of these days.  As one who spent twenty years with small tented circuses here in the United States and Canada, it was wonderful to see someone still out there presenting the traditional circus.  I had the opportunity to meet Dave Duffy at an Irish dinner theater in Dublin a few years ago and he was as gracious and friendly then as he is depicted in this great DVD.  The filmmaker truly captured the essence of this unique form of entertainment.  If you cannot travel to Ireland to see the show, then get this DVD -- well worth the price.  A must have for the circus fan.

It took me to a place I hadn't been before- and frankly never thought I'd go.  Traveling with the circus in Ireland.  Fascinating take on circus life.  If you like documentary films, you should get this.  And if you're Irish- it's even better!!!",1164931200,4,347,4.428571428571429
