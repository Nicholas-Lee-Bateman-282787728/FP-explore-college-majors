included in this VHS tape, but I'm a big fan of the Clark's and they were my primary focus, so this wasn't too much of an upset. If you want to have a good praise break and worship service at home and you love these sisters, I would recommend this for you. Clark's covered only!",1330387200,,396,4.293333333333333
8165539,5,630495056X,THIS VEDIO IS AWESOME. THE CLARK SISTERS ARE OFF THE CHAIN. THIS IS HOW I EVEN GOT STARTED INTO THE CLARK SISTERS. THEY ARE SO ANOTINTING. AND THIS VEDIO IS JUST GREAT. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE THIS VEDIO. I PROMISE YOU THAT THIS WILL BLESS YOUR SOUL.,1131062400,,250,4.340425531914893
8165540,4,630495056X,"This truly is a wonderful performance. It's vintage Clark Sisters before they were ""glamorized"" by a recording industry looking to boost sales.

In spite of this, I must recommend that you NOT buy this video. A better purchase would be ""Gospel (1982)"", a Delta Library Co. release. Amazon lists this as a James Cleveland item, available on both DVD and VHS tape.

In addition to Rev. Cleveland, it features THE SAME Clark Sisters appearance......plus stellar performances by Walter Hawkins, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, and the legendary Shirley Caesar. The clincher is that it's roughly 1/3 the price of this video, and 93 minutes of great gospel as opposed to 25 min.

So.....why buy the diamond when the entire setting is cheaper?",1093132800,12,730,4.967213114754099
8165541,5,630495056X,"What More Can I Say Other Than ""The Clark Sisters"" Is Anointed By God,Just Like There Home Girl Vanessa Bell Armstrong,They Keep Putting Out Good Music Over & Over Again!!!
All The Hard Work ""Mama Mattie"" Instilled In Them Is Paying Off!!!",1050364800,7,239,4.714285714285714
8165542,5,630495056X,"Though this video is only 25 minutes, it seems like an hour!  It is emotionally charged, and the annointing will fall upon every born again believer in Jesus Christ during its presentation.  The Clark Sisters are truly gospel pioneers on this side of heaven.",1042848000,6,258,4.840909090909091
8165543,5,630495056X,"If you have never had the pleasure of listening to these annointed singers before, be prepared to be blessed!  From their classic ""Name it, Claim it"" to the old gospel standby, ""Hallelujah"" you will be hard pressed not to jump up and shout! Listen to their signature harmonies and delivery and you too will understand why they are the most dynamic singing group of any genre today! I highly recommend it for whenever you need a good spiritual uplifting.",996105600,6,453,4.734177215189874
8165544,5,630495056X,"There is no group that can compare to the unique, anointed style of the Clark Sisters.  These ladies are truly blessed and they have held on to God's unchanging hands.  They have not changed, they have always stood for  God's music and praises have always come from their mouthes.  This tape is  truly a church service.  If you want to be touched, buy this tape.",938736000,11,362,4.492307692307692
