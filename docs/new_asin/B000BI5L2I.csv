8135982,5,B000BI5L2I,"Carlos (Enrique Guzman) parents (Susana Cabrera and Eduardo Alcaraz) and Rosita's (Angelica Maria) parents (Bertha Moss and Andres Soler) are all friends and want to join the two families, so become obsessed in pairing their kids but the only problem is, since they grew up together, they hate each other, like any brother and sister do.
Carlos and Rosita know each other on the surface, so they think they don't like what they see. But from hate to love there's only one little step and they don't want to take it.
The more the kids resist, the more their parents try. Hypnotism, reverse psychology, recorders during sleep, nothing works! One day, they decide to try once and for all so they can call it quits and keep with their lives, but little by little they realize they have more things in common than they thought.
Watch for a musical number preformed by Robertha, peruvian singer daughter of Fetiche and the huge semi-circular staircase, which also appears in a previous Angelica Mara movie ROMEO CONTRA JULIETA-1968.",1316649600,,1026,4.868571428571428
