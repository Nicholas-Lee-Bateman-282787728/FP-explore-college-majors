1575239,2,B00005JPAS,"This film is gorgeous to look at; the costuming and locations are superb.  However, I did find the film does drag; I thought it ran over three hours and was shocked to find that it was around half that.

There are many repetitive scenes, (rather like watching MTV) that I believe were meant to show the excesses enjoyed by the French Royal Family; but there was no juxtaposition of images of the general conditions suffered by the French peasants which would have been useful in understanding the callousness of the French upper classes.  Although one could assume that the point of not doing this would be to show how out of touch and isolated Marie Antoinette was; it's my opinion that the viewer still does not gain very much insight into Marie Antoinette's behavior with the exception of learning perhaps her youth and that of her husband, Louis were to blame.

However, for sheer physical beauty, it is worth seeing on the big screen.  I did feel that it could have been a really great film with a better script.  Somehow, this movie is more a music video than a historical epic.",1159574400,7,1084,4.619791666666667
1575240,5,B00005JPAS,"I saw this movie in Paris this summer as it has already been released in France for several months.  As a lover of this time period, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the costumes, sets, and language were all historical--only the musical score is modern, as can be previewed on the teaser trailer.  And in fact it worked quite well.  The movie is based on an excellent book by Antonia Fraser that portrays the queen in a more human way and attempts to cast a more favorable and reasonable light upon the woman who was the butt of much ridicule and scandal from the day she stepped on French soil.  The film is beautifully executed--a real treat for the eyes.  Coppola transports the viewer to another world that most of us have never even dreamed of--and presents a film of pure pleasure to those of us who have.",1157328000,17,817,4.456375838926174

1575410,5,B00005JPAS,"RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Marie Antoinette "" chronicles France's iconic but doomed queen, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), from just prior to her betrothal & marriage to Louis XVI at 15 in 1770 to her reign as queen at 19, her eventual decline, and the close of her reign with the fall of the Palace of Versailles, located a few miles West of Paris.

This is an opulent and beautifully stylized interpretation of the historical events combining period tunes with anachronistic modern music (new wave, post-punk and electronica), which successfully humanizes the historical figures and their world for a contemporary audience. The first two acts effectively show what life in Versailles was like for royalty & nobles in the 18th century; but the last act subtly conveys the looming upheaval of the brutal French Revolution, which was the consequence of foolish spending and blithe, luxuriant living without concern for the common people.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in France with studio work done at Pinewood Studios, England. WRITER: Sofia based her script on Antonia Frasers book Marie Antoinette: The Journey. BOX OFFICE: With a budget of $40 million, the film took in a little over $60 million worldwide.

I can tell it's one I will watch again, for the fine details and for the exquisitely crafted world that makes it feel as though you are there. Now, if you think you know the story, go and read up on the much debated aspects of her life first. The director does an impeccable job of conveying what it may well have been like to be in the shoes of Marie Antoinette. Dunst makes you empathize with her through brilliant acting. Heck, the whole cast is masterful. I'm not a fan of period dramas *at all* and I was captivated and even though my husband had no interest in the topic per se, he was drawn in as well. Most of all, I love that she's neither hero nor villain-queen, but just humanized. That's refreshing.",1512950400,4,771,4.2517006802721085

1575580,5,B00005JPAS,"A beautiful film that looks into the sadness that Marie Antoinette must have felt in isolation surrounded by selfish people in decadence. Her own frivolous expenditures in full view in Sofia Coppola's gorgeous cinematography.

You get the feeling that Coppola wants the viewer to understand where Antoinette came from in her own perspective, so that you might better understand how someone could rot away in high fashion, delicacies, and opulence. It's a lovely piece of art film that captures the wealthiest times in France, the disassociated royalty, while also notably attempting to persuade you of Marie's humanity.

A character study within a historical picture, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is a blissful stroll through the garden, but be careful not to stay there too long, lest you give into the luxury. In all, Marie Antoinette is an exquisite narrative and emotional take on a much maligned historical figure treated with the utmost respect and care. Sofia Coppola has never filmed sorrow with such sublime reverence and reason. It's her Virgin Suicides on a much larger scale with a massive budget well spent. I highly recommend Marie Antoinette.",1503964800,9,1161,5.236559139784946

1575749,5,B00005JPAS,"As noted in previous reviews, while this movie may not be 100% historically accurate, it nevertheless paints a passionate portrait of the people, era and events in question.
Marie Antoinette is probably the most misunderstood woman in recent history. This film gives you an intimate view of this tragic heroine, and you can really feel the sadness and humiliation she endured, having had the welfare of a shaky new royal alliance put squarely on her young teenage shoulders. And she is portrayed in such a way as to make you want to root for her. But sadly, we all knew how it would end before we started to watch.
The cinematography is gorgeous, and while I thought going in that the modern soundtrack would be distracting, it strangely just works. And though the overall mood of the film is sombre, there are fun and lighthearted moments that make the ensuing tragedy a bit easier to bear. I highly recommend this film to everyone.",1494720000,4,933,4.730061349693251

The stunning, sometimes startling beauty of the film transports the viewer into the dreamlike world' of this young woman and her companions.

We all expect the music to come from some of the great composers of opera, with the Minuet being the dance of the times, and music to fit the time of high born upbringing, but like I said, I was quite surprised with the new age music that was used.  Also, the costumes were impeccably fabricated.  Ths brought a sense of being there.  God, they must have been so bored with very little to do other than eat and party and spend huge amounts of money while the common folk suffered from extremely high taxes to keep the King and Queen in the lifestyle they thought they deserved. I was a little put back when, at the end of the movie, they showed Marie, the queen, and her husband, the King of France riding off into the sunset, when in fact she and the King were seized and executed for the many serious crimes, (High Treason being the most serious).  Marie Antoinette was put to death via guillotine on October 16, 1793 in a public square where anyone could watch.

The merciless overburning results in jitter towards the end of the 2 hours plus film rendering this part practically unwatchable. I tested this on three different payers.

Aside from that major issue image quality is subpar throughout given the very low bitrate that has to suffice in order to stuff it on a single layer.

1576134,3,B00005JPAS,"While I love every aspect of this film,I did not care for Asia Argento as Madame Dubarry..I mean Madame Dubarry was French not a Mexican spitfire..Gladys George in the 1938 version was the best Madame Dubarry I have ever seen! Also while the film was stunning! I mean absolutely beautiful eye candy! And Kirsten Dunst played a great Marie Antoinette..Norma Shearer was the best Marie Antoinette...the 1938 version was more historically accurate I think that you have to include the whole life of Marie Antoinette including her husband's death,her children being taken away her death and yes it was done in black and white but between the 2 films it was done right...in the 2006 version it shows Marie Antoinette having an almost like happy ending...but in reality she had no happy ending..I would say while this is a visually stunning film...in a lot of aspects it is historically inaccurate...so between the 2 film's while they are both good in some good movies the 1938 version is the most accurate of the 2 and while the 2006 version is more eye candy where it missed the mark...I often wished that it would have been made into a mini series where the whole aspect of Marie Antoinette's life could have been shown that's why I'm giving this a 3 star rating instead of a 5 star one...p.s.plus they left out the affair of the necklace which the 1938 version did not",1476576000,,1366,4.695833333333334

1576265,2,B00005JPAS,"This is a great movie, great director (sophia Coppola) but the problem is the US movie industry is really fickled when it comes to releasing great film on current formats.  This bluray of Marie antionette plays fine in US bluray players, the sound is good too. The only annoying thing is you can't turn of the dang french subtitles, at all!  You can change the audio from french to english but you are stuck the the subtitles.  And the other part of mess, since the movie companies are being cheap, they are now releasing this movie on BD-R (recordable bluray disc) when you put in a request for this movie.  Thats fine but what kind of crap is that?",1475971200,4,650,4.436974789915967

1576270,5,B00005JPAS,"This is a fantastic movie which I greatly enjoy and especially considering the aesthetic of the film was very much looking forward to having in my BluRay collection. However, what is terribly annoying and actually quite ridiculous, imo, is the formatting of this disc. Being a French disc I was worried that it wouldn't play as I am in the US, but it plays fine. The problem is that when one changes the audio track to English (which ironically is the original language of the movie's release) the disc automatically displays French subtitles on screen and there is no way to turn the subtitles off as long as the English audio track is playing. Needless to say this entirely ruins the fantastic bluray experience of the movie and will cause me to return it. Apparently this movie is not important enough to be offered on BD in the US and regardless of the exorbitant price I was rather excited to have purchased it as such, but as often is the case, clearly, joke's on me.",1473379200,2,973,4.565714285714286

With superb baroque design and incredible movie making access to the Versailles, this film combines an authentic baroque ""feel"" and visuality with modern American lingo cum""camp"", the Queen says things like ""wow"" and ""That's cool.""  As one who has published professionally on the life of the queen and who also doesn't like rock music, I was sure I would hate this film. Instead, I was charmed and persuaded. It is an at angle translation of her life into modern idiom, a side glance that sees. Camera work, at times semi-documentary style, is consistently compelling. Good editing. Ebert said something like ""this film is about one's essential loneliness in a crowded world of people."" Oh, with the ever and still beautiful Judy Davis and Marianne Faithfull.

1576498,5,B00005JPAS,"Instead of telling the story of Marie Antoinette from a flirtatious, scandalous queen's point of view (like many of us would expect, due to what we know from history), this movie instead tells her story through an innocent and playful princess's perspective.  It is a very sweet story about a young girl who is surrounded by people who are completely different from her but is forced to try and become as they are.  The movie is also very stunning visually and the music makes it fun and lighthearted.  Great for teenaged girls (I would have to make the statement that this is definitely a chick movie).",1459296000,2,603,4.669811320754717

I did read the letters Marie Antoinette and I think she was someone of extreme privilege that did not understand life outside of her world.  The inept portrayal of her husband is probably fairly accurate as well.  I have not done a lot of research but I found no contradictions in the film.  I know it's not a serious historical piece.  It also at times feels like the funding ran short or Sofia Coppola did not know how to limit this project to a manageable size.  The end feels like an afterthought and lacks a feeling of completeness and the sets seem bare.  It feels like they through it together.  Otherwise it's entertaining and the focus is on Marie Antoinette's frustrations and her focus on having fun.  Honestly, I think a lot of people would fall into that trap.  Especially, those that never faced adversity.  I felt like a lot of the acting was quite good.  The costumes were amazing and the sets were very nice.

I thought it was really well done and Kirsten Dunst did a great job playing the role.  However, this is just one ""interpretation"" of Marie Antoinette, which is very kind and empathetic to her character.  I've never read a biography of her but just know of her as someone who was rather heartless and selfish.  In this movie she is very sweet and just simply fun loving and naive.",1445040000,,480,4.3

1576937,3,B00005JPAS,"I bought this movie specifically to see the costuming as a part of my research for upcoming 1780s gowns I am creating.  I was not disappointed.  The costuming, wigs and accessories were very elegant to be sure.  In this respect is was a very fine affair.  The staging was stellar and it appeared to have actually been filmed at Versailles, which was really nice.  Visually, the film seemed historically accurate and felt in the moment.  As for the story/script I was non-plussed which went double for the acting.  There was no chemistry whatsoever anywhere and certain casting choices were appallingly off the mark.  It was sort of dead in the water, that is to say it had no life force to speak of really.  The cinematography was lovely and all other production qualities were very high, just no soul.  To have that kind of budget with permission to film at Versailles and then to just throw it down the drain left me feeling a little sad.  Watch it for its visual qualities, but don't expect to ""feel"" anything from the actors, though we may have the director to thank for that.  Harumpf!!!",1442448000,2,1092,4.630208333333333
1576988,2,B00005JPAS,"feast, or famine? your choice. clearly coppola has made the choice in this tiresome version of Marie Anoinette's life to let us all feast on the stunning visual details and condemns the viewer to famine in terms of an actual story.  this is one of the french queen's dresses hanging from a nail...all style and luxe with no body to animate it.  it's a shame hollywood chose this particular director to waste what could have been a blockbuster movie, the story is dramatic, pathetic, heart rending as is the book that inspired it. instead, it's insipidly empty, just a shadow of what it could have been, which is entirely frustrating for this viewer.

dunst, never one of my favorite actresses, nonetheless does a marvelous turn as the doomed queen. i'm not sure what the logic was behind the choice of Jason Schwartzman for louis. he's passable, but then again, there are far more appropriate actors to choose from. was there a dry spell in the pickings somehow? he underplays his part, and some of his scenes with dunst are quite touching, but the truth is that he doesn't convey the vacillating weakness of the french king, which truly led them down the path to doom. however, dunst manages to capture Marie's fear and mental exhaustion in a powerfully mute performance.

the cinematography is quite simply dazzling. i could do with less of the the multicolored pastel pastries, which read like an ad for whatever patisserie they gave a fat contract to. otherwise, i'd suggest the norma shearer version which is mannered and sweetly naive, but with far more art than empty mediocrity.

and the music? thank god the trendiness of including contemporary music into costume pics has gone the way of the early 2000's. it was cute in a knight's tale, but here it lumbers into each festive moment, and some that are not so festive, interrupting the flow of the story like the guest that would not go home, and i found myself lowering the volume in disgust. you're dealing with the eighteenth century here, the time of mozart and beethoven and bach. surely they could've found something fun to spice up the score, instead of this intrusive adolescent soundtrack. frankly, it's demeaning, as if you couldn't watch the movie without some enticement. it's a bit embarrassing, in fact.as is the entire movie.",1441929600,6,2299,4.824873096446701

1576990,5,B00005JPAS,"Although this movie contains very little dialogue, I keep coming back to it again and again. For one, it is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen (extremely high level of detail in costume and set design!). It also does a fantastic job of making the period feel more relatable by adding in contemporary music, which sounds strange, but I found it to mesh surprisingly well with the 'historical' visuals and I think it's definitely one of the film's artistic strengths. Other reviewers have complained that it ends a little abruptly when her family flees Versailles, but I feel like if it had continued, it would have been so predictable and overdone that it would have been a waste of run time. Better that it ended when it did, I think (it's not like anyone was expecting a happy ending, right?). Overall, I think that it's an extremely interesting movie and definitely worth a watch if you enjoy historical dramas. It was a fantastic insight into the personal life of such an infamous woman.",1441238400,,1010,4.711864406779661

1576996,3,B00005JPAS,"The movie lacked an air of Frenchiness (perhaps a few French accents would have helped) but overall the scenery and costumes were pretty, the acting not bad, and the script was tolerable. Marie Antoinette was an Austrian princess sent to marry the French king, a royal dweeb, for alliance purposes, and to bear an heir. She was in a real bind because the king showed no interest in her, for which we sympathize. So she becomes a shopaholic. It's not clear which of the two pictures of Marie Antoinette are more accurate, but history has probably given her a bum rap. This is not a memorable film, but it is a passable 1 hr 40 min.",1440374400,,630,4.439655172413793

Not to mention the character who is involved with her affair is very....dark and handsome. :)

However, it is totally innocuous and there is not a single abrasive or anxious moment in the entire film; even when they are being led to the Bastille; now that takes some doing, kudos to the director.

The production values are as sweet as the confections and gowns; frivolity and silliness are the rule of the day; life is full of champagne bubbles, marzipan and meringue infused sweets, the thrill of the roulette table and affairs of the heart under the stars, all presented to the viewer on a canvas of exquisite pastel colors and perfume fragrances .

It's like Vogue, Vanity Fair and Town & Country all decided to have girls day (and night) out and left a trail of wilted Platinum Amex cards and deliriously happy couture, jewelry merchants, restauranteurs and club owners.

The film fell flat in portraying not only one very famous historical figure but also the period itself. Even the acting was dull and not believable. They did try, but in the end is just another movie about Marie Antoinette. Nothing special, nothing memorable. You're better off reading books on the subjects, vs watching this movie.

1577492,1,B00005JPAS,"Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette? Jason Schwartzman in a powdered wig roaming the 18th century? Having just reviewed the Reese Witherspoon version of Thackeray's great 19th century novel Vanity Fair and confronting the fact that Hollywood has lost the ability to tell a story, I couldn't resist looking at exhibit B of the argument. From its inane casting to dialogue that is nothing but empty prattling to its criminal waste of being allowed to film at Versailles (the name of Coppola still carries weight), there is a real problem in Hollywood with its inability to tell a story without turning it into a comic book. What's next: Marvel Comics Studios presents Tolstoy's War and Peace starring Vin Diesel?

Kirsten Dunst is a good actress. What I've seen of her work I really like. She is seriously miscast here. She lacks the regal quality coupled with emotional fragility and growing anxiety and despair that she should radiate as her life as Marie becomes unglued. There is little of that here. As for Jason Schwartzman: Bored to Death in Brooklyn makes sense, Louis-Auguste in 18th century France actually makes me shudder. If it was the intention to display some sort of emotional or sexual weakness by casting him, then if I were Jason I'd be really angry with my agent. The rest of the cast features some good actors and actresses who often strike me as looking somewhat quizzical; roaming these historic locations they appear to be wondering whether their time might be better spent in looking for their cameras. The scenery and sets are beautiful, the actors make a valiant effort but the director is out of her depth. If this film is her vision of the tragic events that led to the execution of a queen, she should look a little deeper. The French Revolution ultimately became a European calamity. This film might possibly be its last victim.",1416787200,,1855,4.833333333333333

The Catholic king Louis XVI did not commit a crime against his own people.

The movie reminds me of Our Lord warned in 1689.

The protestants, jews, possibly jesuits, and masons caused the French Revolution War on July 14, 1789.

We have less than 2 MORE YEARS LEFT since 1917.

Our Lord told Sister Lucy in Rianjo, Spain in 1931 that unless the Pope and the bishops do as Our Lady commanded and consecrate Russia to Her Immaculate Heart, they will be severely punished as was the King of France for failing to consecrate that nation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

In 1689, the King Louis XIV (14) of France was told by St. Margaret Mary that Our Lord  commanded him to consecrate France to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  The King refused.  In 1789, 100 years later, the French Revolution overthrew the King.

While in prison awaiting his execution, King Louis XVI (16) performed the consecration requested of his predecessor a century before, but it was too little, too late.  The consecration had to be public and solemn.  It was only private and simple.  The horrors had been let loose! What horrors have we suffered since 1917!  What horrors lie ahead?

Our Lady of Fatima prophesied that unless she were obeyed, ""Nations will be annihilated.""  How can a nation be annihilated?  We do know how!

Just about few months ago (September 2013) regarding the Crimean Crisis an official Russian TV station in a veiled threat to the USA it was announced that Russia ""could reduce the USA to nuclear waste"" in a very short period of time.  Unless we obey Fatima now, we may be the first nation ever to be ANNIHILATED!

So we are acting now, with TRIUMPH: 2017! Our Lady has been very patient with us, as is a loving mother with a wayward child, but sooner or later, a child must either obey or face punishment.  Our time of reckoning approaches.",1416614400,,1843,4.574923547400612

It took 7 years after their marriage till they had sex for first time and have their fisrt child, which she was very much ridiculed for, for the child count at that far into a marriage at that time should have been well over 5-7.

1577546,2,B00005JPAS,"I'd have to hand it to the designers as the costumes were great, but the rest of this film pales in comparison to the black and white cinematic treasure that starred Norma Shearer and Tyrone Powers. It just seemed too Hollywood-ized for me. There's a lot of over-emphasis on Marie Antoinette and Louis the 16th's perceived failure to consummate their marriage in the early years; which leads to the Queen's extravagant escape into clothing, shoes, and sweets. As someone who's read her biography and gleaned a lot of info about the ""other"" side of the Queen other than the callous and indifferent to the poor attitude that she was unfairly maligned with--she was dealing with all the court intrigue, the catty Madame duBarry, the early lack of intimacy in her marriage as well as being unprepared as a spirited teen for the demands of ruling the country.
The first movie is almost three hours long, it's in b & w, but outstanding as far as historical dramas go. All the different facets of Marie Antoinette's life are handled with great poise, Tyrone Power shines as her secret lover Axel from Sweden, and her ill-fated soujurn in prison and trip to the guillotine are treated with dignity and manage to evoke a little more sympathy from viewers.",1415923200,,1246,4.773148148148148

But what human being with any heart whatsoever would stand by when others are suffering so egregiously?  On the other hand maybe the director was making a subtle point about the parallel to our modern situation here in the US where the less than one percent are amassing more and more wealth while the populace is in a frenzy of cheap consumption.  No I don't feel sorry for the aristocrats of France but I do feel that the guillotine is going too far in taking care of the issue, except on a symbolic level (ie 'decapitating' the total embrace of greed).",1415059200,,813,4.541095890410959

This revolutionary biopic equated the 1780s with the 1980s, using music to make the connection; all those who couldn't make the connection had fits over it.  But read Roger Ebert's review of the film; he loved it.  And remember that Sophia Coppola got to set the whole thing in the REAL Versailles and surrounding Royal Palaces, including the Queen's beloved Petit Trianon.  There will most likely never be another film this good or this original about such a good and original character as Marie Antoinette.

She gives us a teenage princess and Queen we can relate to in 21st century terms and attitude. I read and highly recommend Antoine Fraser's book, Marie Antoinette-The Journey, which the film is based-on. Fraser's book is both refreshing and insightful.

1577670,1,B00005JPAS,"What a terrible waist of history, a most fascinating woman --- and I do not mean the actress, but rather Marie Antoinette --- location shots, costumes, etc. - etc. - etc. --- I could go on and on and on. What a terrible waist!!! I have read several historically correct books about the French Court, Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and her tragic life, etc. Believe me when I state that this was not about Marie Antoinette! I viewed this movie last night on television --- simply because of the title. I have seen the Norma Shearer version several times, and I must state that it is absolutely beautiful, and Miss Shearer's acting is superb. That version gives one a true feeling as to a sense of the woman, her world, her troubles, and the times.

The one that I viewed last night was a most terrible disappointment! Why would one wish to make an historical movie, and yet disregard the facts and the essence of the period entirely? The French Court was not about pastries, shoes and nonsense --- as depicted in this movie. It entailed much more. Marie Antoinette was an Austrian Princess who had been educated and prepared to fulfill her political role within the French Court. She was intelligent and vivacious. She was not a loose idiot. This movie looked as if it was running amuck to nowhere with its choice of modern day bad language, terrible music and horrible ear piercing singing. Point one --- why would one even consider modern music --- if indeed one would call it that --- as a score for an historical movie? Point two --- the cast went about in their costumes speaking literally incorrect absolute nonsense --- If I may be so bold as to ask --- who spoke in such a manner in the French Court or in any court for that matter? What was the point? Was it because the film makers felt that the audience was illiterate, deaf and dumb? --- That they would not understand? Prior to the French revolution, the French Court was filled with intrigue. Louis XIV was a most fascinating figure,and his mistress was a cunning woman. Enter Marie Antoinette. She was just one of the pieces in a complex political chess game. Nothing was portrayed correctly in this movie. Not a thing! --- Except perhaps the scenic shots of Versailles. No wonder the French were not happy at Cannes. If one wishes to know the truth --- please read the books, and view the other movie. Then perhaps you will understand why this merits only a one star. Marie Antoinette is watching from above --- and she is not happy!",1401753600,8,2495,4.556792873051225

It was horribly directed, horribly acted, slow to the point of putting you to sleep and ends just as the real good stuff is about to start happening - RETRIBUTION.  One thing that is terribly distracting and impossible to understand is the use of modern music, loud modern music, here and there in the movie.  In particular, the rendition of Fools Rush in by one of the worst singers I've ever heard just goes on and on.  In the first part of the movie they show you to the point of just putting a gun to your head the protocol of getting her out of bed and dressed and the putting to bed of both of them. Later they just drop this totally and she is hopping into bed with the soldier anytime she wants to.  If she was spending all her time at Petite Trianon with her friends and her lover how did she have time to sleep with her husband thus explaining the second child, the boy. If this movie was based on a book then it's either the worst book about her that was ever written or it is the worst adaptation.  I am leaning toward it being the worst adaptation.

1577783,5,B00005JPAS,"This is a hauntingly beautiful look, close-up, at the banality, decadence, and supreme narcissism of Marie Antoinette's life; in this film, her life stands as a microcosm for the entire regime she represents: it is meaninglessly composed of wretched excess in one form after another, and the camera plays lovingly on all of the beautiful, nauseatingly sweet and over-ripe excesses that were Versailles.

Sophia Coppola handles this girl queen's fate with consummate artistry, revealing her both as a young queen who rises to the occasion and as an innocent, obedient girl who is never spiteful or cruel like some of the women who surround her at court. She never really grows up, but the film seems to ask, What were her options? Her options boil down to the style of sleeve she will choose for her new frock or the tasty tidbit she will choose to put in her mouth from the endless array of picture-perfect pastries that are always at her elbow. The soundtrack is peppered with 80s' new wave tunes--which I thought brilliantly played up the youthful self-absorption of Marie and her courtiers as they gamble, eat, drink and watch the sun rise: they haven't a thought beyond their experience of the now as pure pleasure. It never occurs to them that life could consist of anything other than complete self-indulgence.

I did not feel sorry for the Marie Antoinette of this film, but I understood her far more deeply than I expected to. What really came as a surprise was the dignity with which she accepts her fate at the end of the film, and surrenders herself to the will of the people. She seemed to understand perfectly that it was her turn to be served up as a royal tidbit at the guillotine, and she surrenders to her fate without a moment's hesitation. We certainly aren't supposed to pity her, but there is a kind of relief in one of the closing shots which shows the destruction wrought upon the royal bedroom by the ""rabble"" who were starving to death as Marie continued trumping each previous pleasure with a new one.",1396224000,7,2027,4.707042253521127

I liked that you felt like you were connecting with Marie Antoinette as a person and you feel like she could have been your best friend.  I think in that respect, Kirsten Dunst did a marvelous job of breathing Marie Antoinette's personality into the audience.  Don't expect the movie to focus on the political problems (although they do touch on it lightly), or the life they had during the French Revolution.  This is not a doumentary, it is entertainment.  Even in this film that did not try to be historically accurate, I LOVE that they still managed to debunk that horrible rumor that she ever said, ""Let them eat cake.""  If there were someone that never studied the French Revolution and didn't know much about Marie Antoinette, they have at least been educated that she never said that, and that she was a wonderful, loving person.

1577788,2,B00005JPAS,"I'm disappointed at this rendition of the Marie Antoinette. Kirsten Dunst's performance left a lot to be desired. I felt she never broke out her shell during the 2 hrs of the movie. I don't feel that I know Marie Antoinette the character as ""she"" did not engage the audience and expose her ""true self"". It reminds me of another film, the Duchess starring Keira Knightley. In both movies, I feel the lead actresses did not get in the role - they appear to be more enamored themselves acting than channeling the persons and souls of their character.

Another reason I'm disappointed with the film is that I didn't have a theme - it left me ask at the end: ""What's the point?"". I get that Dunst's character was unhappy with her marriage, and she and her husband nevertheless had a cordial albeit passionless marriage.  But what's the message?

1577982,2,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola is an incredible, innovative director. Sadly Marie Antoinette falls short of her normal masterpieces.

While intensely beautiful, the movie takes too many chances in both casting and soundtrack. While I love the idea of combining the native accents of each actor, this is a period piece and it is distracting to jump between American, German, Australian, English and Scottish accents.
Far more disconcerting is the soundtrack. I am loathe to criticize it as it was both a courageous and groundbreaking selection, but it falls far short of its intended novelty. Rather than bringing the audience into sync with the young couple in the movie it is constantly discordant to the point of detracting from the fantastic beauty of the film.

She must maintain everything French from the language to literally the clothes on her back from that moment on.

1578068,5,B00005JPAS,"At first viewing I thought I would barf. The film seemed narcissistic, self indulgent, gratuitous. It seemed that the only good thing about the film might be the obviously beautiful cinematography. Then I decided to give it one more shot and watch it again. And there, in this most magical second viewing, I discovered the brilliance of Sophia Coppola. When you get past the simple, almost annoying teenaged dialogue, it hits you that these were actually teens, 14 to be exact in Marie Antoinette's (MA) part, and even had she been speaking in French, and a long time ago, her dialogue would have likely had the same rhythm: slightly shallow and sweet but very much a young girl. I could almost imagine a bedazzeled cell phone popping from under her skirt while sitting at church while she fills her cell phone's screen with a long string of acronyms. The dialogue of all things was actually the first thing that really helped me get into the mind of Ms. Coppola. Right from the start she wanted us to be in MA's world and what better way than to make us feel like a teenaged girls ourselves?

Another thing that she, and in turn the brilliant Kirsten Dunst portrayed, is getting me to see past the masses of sugar coated pastels that were all the rage at the time and allow me to see a deep and complex vulnerability. After watching the movie for a second time I started to do some reading on the the ill-fated queen - her story, despite it's excesses and privilege that surrounded it ended quite badly.  It made me wonder what her life might have been like had she been raised to think about anything other than herself and had she not been in the unfortunate position of being sold off to the neighboring country as a peace offer. I don't know but I think that things might have turned out well for her, say, as a farmer's wife. . .

I think I now understand the reaction of some critics who probably hated it as much as I did when the film premiered. Perhaps the biggest challenge for the viewer, and it was true for me, was to think that it was actually possible to have two silly kids running a country and having all of the other equally silly adults giving them such minimal direction that they basically watched a country fall apart. Honestly, the entire concept was almost too difficult to watch.

I now put on the film when I am looking for something familiar and comforting. There is something very real about her story although her life could not be further from my own. I think back and pity her, not for her excess and extravagance to the point of revulsion, but for the loneliness she must have felt being alone in a country and in a household that did not really want her. Perhaps it's her loneliness that you feel in the entire film that makes it so remarkable. Even in scenes of grandeur, you see it living right on the screen. Long moments of pure and unadulterated loneliness that leave me feeling strangely sad.

I would not MA's life even if it were handed to me on a gold platter. However, I can now say that every single time I watch the film I uncover some other little nugget that Sophia slyly hid on the screen for me to find.",1379635200,3,3154,4.431034482758621

1578070,2,B00005JPAS,"Was it stylish? Yes.  Was it probably a stylish way to deliver some sort of message -- like how Marie Antoinette's life was all about nothing but sitting around being stylish and disconnected? Probably.  Didn't change the fact that it was boring as hell to watch.

This was one of those movies where some people will get all frustrated and say that it was disconnected on purpose ... shows how Marie's life was all about court life, glamour, and gossip while oblivious to the issues outside that led to the revolution and her ultimate demise.  But again, it doesn't stop the movie from being two hours of nothingness, just montages of glamorous this and that and long stretches of dullness.  Moments of meaning -- childbearing woes, talk of American revolts etc -- are few and far between. Took me three tries to get through the dvd which I stuck to believing they'd finally have to get to some action with the revolution, and even then they barely did.",1376956800,,953,4.648809523809524
1578071,2,B00005JPAS,"I enjoyed Lost in Translation, but I was very disappointed in the total lack of emotional connection to Marie in this film. The original book was filled with politics, court intrigue, world events, and fascinating people. At age 14, Marie is thrust into this hopelessly insulated, self-indulgent world. She's a sweet-natured, vacuous thing who is required only to be pretty and be part of a captive breeding program. She's unable to complete the latter as her equally dimwitted husband doesn't have a clue. Unfairly blamed for Louis' problems, she fills her lonely life with endless parties, hangers-on, and shopping. Marie's brother eventually explains the facts of life to Louis and Marie finally manages to have a couple kids. She eventually has an affair with a pretty solider just before the French Revolution becomes a reality and it all goes pear-shaped.

The direction is simply terrible, with Coppola confusing long lingering camera shots as actual storytelling. Kristen Dunst is beautiful and brings a certain winsomeness to the young Marie, but she just can't sustain interest throughout Coppola's endless and repetive shots of Marie gazing out the window, Marie gazing out the coach, Marie gazing over the gardens, Marie gazing at the ceiling from her bed, etc.  Gaze, gaze, gaze, gaze a little more.  We can't even imagine that anything that's going on in Marie's head because we already know that the answer is: not much.

But Coppola's biggest failures as a writer and director are that she is simply unable to make Marie's world even a little compelling. So instead she substitutes lovely atmosphere, stunning costumes, and amazing vistas for plot, dialog, or heart. It works as a travelogue, but sucks as a story about humans.

It's not correct judge Marie by today's standards; She's a powerless woman.  Also, she's isn't even a little interested in gaining any power or control over her life.  When things begin to go south politically the best she can offer is to stop buying diamonds.  In short, she's just insipid.
Yes, we are entirely within Marie's world and while it's beautiful, it has an empty, uninteresting, even rather stupid soul--it's like the Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian of films.  Ultimately, it's just tedious.",1376870400,,2248,5.086956521739131
1578072,5,B00005JPAS,"I've read books on MA, and fell in love with her. So I was worried when this movie came out, honestly. I really love how this movie shows the softer side of her with her children at the farm. She just didn't like convention. French court at that time was a stickler for custom! She was just a child who couldn't conform. I also really loved the modern soundtrack :)",1376524800,,365,4.228571428571429
1578073,5,B00005JPAS,"This movie is not a complete portrayal of Marie Antoinette or the times she lived in. Antoinette who certainly grew from a child that could barely read and write to answering accusations at her trail with amazing intellectual ease. During her two day trial she seem to win over those who were in attendance. Drawing applause at some of her answers. The trial was a farce of course which took place during the ""reign of terror"" in which many innocents, including innocent Catholics were put to death during the French revolution. She was a scapegoat, blamed for every ill of the country. The revolutionaries put out all sort of pornographic porn about her. She was everything from a lesbian to and cheat. Mot of it was true but much of it still permeates what we know about her today. Which was nonsense of course as France had been in decline economically for 100 years prior. Due to many things, including one too many wars, Unfair taxes, and an archaic feudal system, which farmers had to give land owners great sums if money which put many out of business. The movie sparingly shows us none of this. Focusing briefly on her childhood in Hofburg Palace in Austria, and her subsequent marriage by proxy to Louis-Auguste of France.  She was a pawn in hopes of bringing everlasting peace between France and Austria.
The real focus of the movie is her life at Versailles. Showing Marie was never comfortable with court etiquette and voiced her displeasure with it. In actuality, this displeasure shocked the ladies of the court. Because of that, and the mere fact Marie was Austrian, she from the very beginning had few friend's in the court. The movie effectively shows us the isolation of her life at Versailles. Cut off from her family, disliked by the ladies of the court. A husband who seemed indifferent to her, at least in the beginning anyways. So she took up refuge with the kings younger brother and Madame Du Barry among others. Folks who were kinda outside the court. Her gambling and endless parties may have been in fact a release for her isolation and loneliness. Not to mention she was a teenage queen for the first few years she was at Versailles.
 Sofia Coppola shows what Antoinette's long days and nights might of been like at Versailles. It portrays a kind hearted, fun loving Marie we all hoped she was, who certainly did not deserve to die such a horrible and inexcusable death. Which the movie thankfully side steps as we all know what happens to her.
 The only part of the movie I did not like is her supposed and unsubstantiated love affair with Count Fersen. She was a devout Catholic so having an affair seems unlikely. Some object to the music overlays using songs such as ""I Like Candy"" and a couple of others. But I say why not? This isn't the Marie Antoinette of the late 18th century. This is the Marie Antoinette of 2006!!

1578104,4,B00005JPAS,"While the movie had its slow moments, it still had a lot of interpersonal action and nonverbal tension to enjoy. I thought Kirsten did a great job with emotion in this movie. You saw young Marie go from an excited new bride to a very depressed woman who felt unloved. When things finally turned around in her marriage, I actually started to like her husband. They had a sweet relationship and it's a bummer that someone slipped between them for a short while, but I was glad when he left because then the King and Queen could be a family again. There were a lot of emotional moments in this movie and I thought Kirsten expressed Marie's feelings well through her facial expressions and her eyes. Overall I enjoyed the movie because it showed the craziness of court life and how indulgent the courtesans became, which spurred the citizens to eventually revolt. The movie ended kind of abruptly, but at the same time, it didn't end on a super depressing note, so that was okay. The scenery and the costumes were gorgeous.

1578113,5,B00005JPAS,"This atmospheric film is done with such a sense of pageantry awash in the bright and pastel colors which would be favored by a young teenaged girl. That is because of the fifteen-year-old Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) who would be queen at age nineteen. Upon coming to Versailles to marry the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzman) who will be King Louis XVI, but now is a teenaged boy who also collects keys instead of bedfellows - like his wife. Her main purpose is to produce a son and heir to the crown to satisfy her father-in-law, King Louis the XV,  but the improbability is all placed on her while her husband ignores her understandably as we realize later. Marie bores of court life and begins to entertain herself in ways which are frowned on like gambling, feasting, collecting French dogs, shopping wildly for shoes and any type of clothing while sharing with her many girlfriends. The whole time the movie is going forward, the music is themed in a zippy sounding neo-punk flavor - like an ""Adam Ant"" figure who looks similar to the courtiers in costumes (and like the Swedish Count Hans Axel von Fersen with whom Marie was rumored to be entangled with at her Petit Trianon) with his dashing good looks. There is something about the soundtrack that rips into the film just as having the freedom of being a fifteen-year-old girl while being consumed in exactly what she loved to do; it's a parallel of a sort to her, at times, reckless behavior.

She attended opera and every social activity which crossed her bored path as the Dauphin still didn't care for her physically and her mother would send almost threatening letters to her saying that she must get him to be 'interested' in her or the whole works fall in the balance and on her teenaged shoulders... The alliance between Austria and France. Sofia Coppola spins a great tale of French royalty loosely based on the historical view of the young queen. Even though we understand from the beginning how this will end, Coppola, fortunately, spares us the details and we are left to view the growth of this queen. Although history is harsh in its recounting of Marie Antionette, here she is given a much fairer treatment to what she was, but this was not a complete historical account, but more a personally done account with feeling of a young teenaged woman charged by her family and the French society for holding down an alliance betwixt two dominant countries of the time... Resplendent with color and light, splendor and vivid imagery of costumes and sets, this look into Marie Antoinette is my absolute favorite to date.",1373068800,3,2584,4.74
1578183,5,B00005JPAS,I think this movie is really underrated. Sofia Coppola hit the nail on the proverbial head again with this one. So what if it isn't completely historically accurate.

1578344,1,B00005JPAS,"I was shocked to see how many people gave this film a favorable review. I thought it was a chaotic mess. The film consists of the same repeating scenes over and over. Marie Antoinette shopping, Louis riding his horse, the two of them in bed, and the two of them at the table eating. There is no plot, no real character development, and a VERY intrusive 80's soundtrack, that is totally inappropriate. In between those scenes are  mumbled jumbled dialogues of unknown people, talking vaguely about people the viewer doesn't know. I swear through half of this film, I felt like I was watching behind the scenes filming of the actors in between takes. It was a lousy telling of one of my favorite stories. It could have easily been one of my favorite films, I really like the actors, and I do admit the filming and costumes were breath taking. But the folly of that music, and the lack of any real story and the ridiculous ""modern"" dialogue (at one point, Marie tells another character ""Oh, you are the best!"") ruined IMO what could have been a great film. If you want to see a good Marie Antoinette story, watch ""The Affair Of The Necklace"". That is a good film.",1358035200,6,1160,4.497630331753554

The end. In addition, most of the characters talk like American college kids while some others have english accents or austrian accents (No french though. Not one. Also Rip Torn plays king Louis. Wha?)

On the good side, the palace is amazing, the costumes immaculate, and the details gorgeous. It starts off well too as the young Austrian gets used to the insane amount of pomp and circumstance that she comes into living in Versailles. The scenery is epic.

After all, if you want to watch an accurate history-based film, take it to the History Channel.

But this drivel can't even muster up intrigue and dialogue worth staying awake for.  It's like all they did was tape the promo photoshoot sessions and then string those awkward silences together for a movie.  Are the costumes beautiful?  Yes.  Is Versaille dripping with extravagance?  Yes.  Will it amuse you to see Moaning Myrtle talking trash while wearing a panier?  Yes, for about five minutes.  But there is nothing INTIMATE or ENTERTAINING about this film; the writers must've gone to the same script-writing school as the twits that gave us Twilight (or ""Expositional Dialogue: the Movie"").  It really wouldn't have been out-of-place for the actor playing Louis XVI to come out and say ""I am Louis XVI.  I am awkward and my willy doesn't work.  Ok, off to go ride horses awkwardly, kthxbai"".  There's no sense of a Marie Antoinette beyond the vapid, spoiled, out-of-touch cardboard figure we already have a generalized sense of whenver you mention poor people and eating cake.  After about an hour of watching Kirsten Dunst plod through a palace in costume, I came to a few conclusions: she can't act but she's good with children; none of those people should have been allowed to ride horses because they're AWFUL at it, and that it would have been a much better movie if Rip Torn had gotten to chew a few more scenes--I mean the man is properly gross and gruff as Louis XIV, let him run rampant instead of making me watch Kirsten dunst take 2 and a half minutes to eat a damn piece of chocolate.

Save your money and your time and go pop in a 'history of fashion' tape--those typically only run about an hour and you don't have to expect anything resembling acting.

As with the other reviewer I agree that The Cure's 'Plainsong' [albeit a 'nihilistic/narcassistic ode' to death] is cleverly incorporated into this film. This review is more about The Cure's Greatest work- 'DISINEGRATION'[1989]- [of which 'Plainsong' is the opening track]- that encapsulates PERFECTLY the 'suicidal/forelorn/abject despair' innate to ALL humans!

This film is cute, quirky, unique, beautiful, inspiring and tragic all at once.

I wondered how Schwartzman was paired as Louis for the cast and at the end of the movie, realized that Coppola created this artwork. Since the two are related, that was an easy conclusion to draw. No matter, however, since Schwartzman is EXACTLY how I picture King Louis looking when comparing his real-life paintings.

The music of the movie makes this film also very chic.

2. The death of Louis Joseph
3. The birth of Louis Charles

How many 14 year olds could be placed in such a postion and react with anything but immaturity at times?  The visual delights of this film, the shoes, the clothes, the decadent food and indulgences bring that particular court to life.  I particularly liked her use of the song ""I want candy!""

1578410,4,B00005JPAS,"Last night's movie was ""Marie Antoinette."" I found it on our DVD shelves  and it must have been purchased by my wife at least a few years ago. The movie was interesting, to be sure, but presented a very incongruent mixture. For one, you should expect to just be overcome by the visuals. Magnificent! Stupendous! Totally unreal! Visually, this is one of the best movies I can ever remember watching. It doesn't matter whether it's the French countryside, the French palace and palace grounds, or the elaborately costumed cast, everything about this film is visually overwhelming and the photography is absolutely first rate. This is a movie I could enjoy by turning the sound off and just watching the visuals. It's that good.

Then there's the music of the soundtrack. Well, in general it's rather good. There's some excellent classical music and there's a lot of what I might term ""French party music"" which is also quite good. Either fit the story of the movie quite well. Interspersed with this fine music are a handful of rock 'n' roll selections. Now, don't get me wrong here. Rock 'n' roll includes some of my favorite music and the selections which they chose were quite good. Evidently, someone had good taste. But, this is a 1770 French period piece and everything is done in that fashion, and done quite well. Why include 1980 American rock 'n' roll songs in the soundtrack, good though they might be? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't help the movie, it disrupts it. Totally incongruent!

Then there's the acting. It's stiff and formal. I just never could get into it. None of the people seemed at all real, except, perhaps, Kirsten Dunst in her role as Marie and that was marginal. Her husband was a stiff and wooden figure that I could never develop any empathy for, and that goes for the overwhelming rest of the cast. What goes here? How can they have such a wonderfully costumed cast and then acting that practically no one could relate to? Then there's another problem. Marie was evidently a widely-despised queen. Well, it didn't show at all. She was by far the most likable person in the cast. Then, and it was fortunately not shown in the movie, she was beheaded shortly after the time of the movie. It just doesn't fit her role in the movie. If she's so despicable, why set her up as the most likable person in the movie? It doesn't make sense.

In any case, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, both good and bad. It's just a splendid spectacle but could have used a lot of work in the writing and directing, in my opinion. I'd rate the visuals as five stars, no question. But the story, acting and sound track might rate no better than a three. Okay, I'll list it as four stars, but I'd consider it to be a badly flawed movie.

Most people are very critical toward this movie for not accurately portraying Marie Antoinette; unless you were alive during the reign of terror NOBODY knows what happened! However, many do not understand that this is not a biographical film nor a period piece, it's a movie born from Sofia Coppola's creative mind meant to depict the life of a famous queen who was actually a normal, yet overprivilaged, teenager. This movie is a lot like ""A Knight's Tale"" due to it's use of modern music and anachronisms and I would recommend that movie as well.

I couldn't even take this movie seriously. It was like Marie Antoinette for the MTV crowd. It was pathetic. The film accomplished nothing. All we see is Dunst in beautiful costumes, eating and whining about not getting it on with her husband.

I kept watching hoping it would get better and it never did. And what was with the modern soundtrack for a period film?

Awful, just awful. I thought The Other Boleyn Girl was bad but that's a masterpiece compared to this crap.

Drawn out scenes to show off the costumes and set designs which were average at best, were not only poorly shot but also made preposterous by the addition of a music score made up of an irrelevant mix of silly pop rock instrumentals with cheesy electronic drum beats and guitars.

Kirsten is meeting the French court and saying ""Hello, and thank you"" in a midwestern accent.

That doesn't make it inherently bad, just a bit of a strain for older couples who like to enjoy watching a film together with interests for both parties.  What is so amazing about this movie is how a fortune must have been spent on costumes, scenery, and rights to film at Versailles and yet so little was really produced.  Moreover, the background music (hard rock) was totally inappropriate to the tone and flow of the movie.

My wife and I kept waiting for some storylines to emerge that would justify the enormous expense and trouble the producers went to in making this film.  Compared to other historical dramas on Elizabeth I, the young queen Victoria, and the like, there was almost nothing of significance here.  All that results is a disbelief that the French royal couple would stay at their palace and wait to be captured and murdered by rebels.  If that's the way it was, fine.  But was it really that simple?  Were these people so removed from reality that they felt they didn't need protection from the starving mobs?  Wasn't there more intrigue with Robspierre, et al?  Where was Napolean Bonaparte and the French army when all this was going on?

1578471,2,B00005JPAS,"This has got to be one of the most asymmetrical period films I've ever seen ~ and I don't mean that in a good way.  Kirsten Dunst is a natural as the title role of Marie Antoinette, but beyond that the movie falters badly.  Even with all of the lavish sets & costumes, it simply doesn't resonate as a well done period film.  {If you're looking for a fabulous period film, albeit from a few hundred years earlier, then check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>}

The focus of the film is to depict a young Austrian girl who is shipped far away from home to a country full of rude people whom she's never met before.  She marries Louis XVI, but she hardly gets the  Harlequin Romance happy ending.  She becomes homesick & finds that her royal husband has little interest in her.  This leads to her becoming a spoiled, free-spending, fun-loving party girl who uses her status to get whatever she wants.

The anachronistic soundtrack does not fit at all & I found it very distracting.  Hearing Rock songs juxtaposed with late 1700s France is not an auspicious combination ~ at least not to me.  On top of that, there are problems with the sound mixing as there were times that I couldn't hear the dialogue clearly because the music was too loud.

The most egregious part of the movie is what it omits.  Yes, Bastille day goes on in the background of the movie and there are references to it (kind of like in a Shakespearian play) but it is not treated with a whole lot of depth.  The end of the movie shows the French king & queen riding in a chariot away from their palace and an angry mob.  Not to sound crude, but the arrest, imprisonment, (sham) trial and execution of Marie Antoinette are among the most interesting aspects of her life.  The ""feel good"" ending just doesn't fit.

All in all, this production struck me as a cross between a 1980s brat pack movie & a high school play.  Very amateurish and disappointing overall.  Fans of history (and the French Revolution in particular) will not come away from watching this film with a good taste in their mouths.

It is clear from the letters from her mother that she was being manipulated and considered nothing but a sow to give birth to the bloodline. I think she tried to escape in Fantasy as much as she could. I do have a problem with the affair part of the film as by all accounts of the people that knew her, and wrote it down, she was a devoted wife to The King.

1578518,2,B00005JPAS,"Presumably this movie is supposed to be taking place in 18th Century Pre/Revolutionary France centering around the life of one Maria Antonia better known as Marie Antoinette which is really the most known Key Figure in the French Revolution, not only because she was a shopaholic queen with no sense of governing the country but also because of the tragic ending she met (Having Her Head cut off by the evil Revolutionaries).

You Have NO idea when you watch this film. Actually if one is to judge it based on the plot, dialogue and the characterizations this movie could be taking place in 21st Century Upstate NY or Palm Beach. There is so much chick flick and so little insight into History.

Kristen Dunst looks the role and is a great actress but doesn't have the chance to shine. Sophia Coppola does very little to use the abilities of her actors in this film or explore the real *historical* figures this movie is based on. The script is very limited. Kristen Dunst walks in a fog infested state half of the movie. I would too if no one was interested in me. The rest of the characters are flat and one dimensional or two dimensional at best.

There is So much then just meet the eye to Marie Antoinette than this movie is portraying, Yes she was sent to France and pushed into a political marriage of convenience with the Dauphine (to be) Louis XVI, Yes he was obsessed with eating, making locks and didn't care about her, Yes the marriage wasn't consummated till after seven years and it affected Marie Antoinette's life bitterly because she was failing at her duty to produce an heir, Yes she felt a silent hostility towards Louis XV's Mistress Du Barry, Yes she started an affair with a Young Swedish aristocrat, Yes she was a big spender, Yes she had little political abilities, Yes the French Hated her and she was sent eventually to her ultimate and tragic death.

However, all that Spending, partying and extravagant attires didn't just come out of no where. There *were* reasons behind it and if one looks at them it actually makes rather perfect sense for her to be this woman she had become.

This movie is accurate enough but the Psychological element is unfortunately lacking severely. We never get to meet the real Marie Antoinette or any of the other characters in her life. We never get to see what she was like before she went to the French Court, the viewer never gets insight into her childhood and thus never truly understands the culture shock she went through in France or understands how she struggled to cope in a foreign country with blunt customs so different and alien from her prudish roots. In the end the viewer has no sympathy for Marie Antoinette, her family or her aristocratic friends.

Telling, Telling, Telling there is so much telling in this movie and almost no showing. We are told that a Revolution is stirring up and that the Royal Family is in danger but we are not shown how or why. The French Revolution is one of the most bloody, brutal and longest Revolutions ever to happen pass the Medieval ages. It is a Revolution that took place in the centre of Europe and lasted for an extraordinary ten years shaking the pyramid world around it.

I am not asking for this movie to be a documentary however to barely touch on one of the goriest revolutions to ever happen in History in a movie happening in the heart of it all is rather disappointing. Plus, since this movie is an obvious Hollywood production and was intended for an America audience in the first place wouldn't it make sense if it involved the Revolution more for people who are unaware of it ? Instead the revolution is a backdrop at best and serves more as a plot device that doesn't even move the story forward.

The ending is also a let down. It is anti-cliamitc since the viewer who knows his history is aware of the manner in which Marie Antoinette has died. Excluding the ultimate Execution scene IMO is the biggest fault this movie made and it only confirms my belief that it is a chick flick taking place in 1700s France.

I understand that Sophia Coppola wanted to make a movie focusing on Marie Antoinette's personal life rather than the French revolution and it is accurate in doing so. Since it touched all Marie's personal affairs but what I find interesting is why the death of her first born son at the age of 7 isn't mentioned in this movie ?

Well, on the other hand the customs are gorgeous, the sets are perfect. The actors all looks great and the scenery is fab. I usually bash on Historical movies for not being accurate not in this case. This time they got the history right, they just didn't get the characterization or the script right.

For a better adoption of Marie Antoinette's life I recommend the Norma Shearer 1938 version. Yes, it is black and white but the acting, customs and the script is awesome. The viewer gets more insight into Marie's personality and her affairs and into the revolution. It is obviously a romanticized version of the story but its fun to watch.

1578519,1,B00005JPAS,"Clearly, this film was an excuse for all involved to indulge in period costume. The costumes and the settings are sumptuous and show incredible attention to detail. Kirstin Dunst's performance is flat and lacks depth -- in fact, I'd be surprised if anyone thought she was ""acting"" like anything other than herself playing dress-up (and I usually like her quite well!). The music and American accents just don't work -- neither do the 20th century concepts of a teenager. In the 18th century, 14 was young but it wasn't a ""teenager.""

Turning 18 would not necessarily be cause for a particular celebration -- did Marie Antoinette really party like a rock star and drag her friends out onto the lawn of Versailles to watch a particularly fake looking sunset? Did she pass out on a sofa in the room where she and her friends partied -- and would the staff actually have started cleaning up there and risk awakening the slumbering queen? I highly doubt it.

Other teenager mannerisms -- like laughing at the dowager snoozing in church, expressing ""EWWW"" and ""those shoes are SO du Barry"" are just 20th century affectations.

In a way, this film reminds me of Deadwood -- highly stylized, and of course we couldn't know exactly how the queen acted and expressed herself, so it's possible to project a 1980s mall brat persona onto her as a ""what if."" Sadly, the character is not developed, we don't see any progression or development of depth leading to transformation from immature child to mother to whatever.

1578520,5,B00005JPAS,"There is such a misconception about the so called flop of Marie Antoinette. Although the movie divided critics ,the major critic reviews were favorable if not very good or even enthusiastic. I am among the enthusiastic ones. First because I know very well the story of M.A. and how it is difficult to interpret her story without being wrong. What Coppola did was to portray a sympathetic portrait of a woman forced to be queen without any help by her mother, husband or courtesans. Coppola brilliantly succeeds to evoke the real situation of that 14 years old girl,who was all alone. Poltics is left out but we are in the world of M.A. I appreciate very much that Coppola didn't want to film the revolution period because if you want to understand the point of view of M.A. you have to forget that she was executed. Coppola is more interested to examine the woman rather than the Queen and her personal feelings towards the entire situation. Besides, we have to remember that this is a movie,not an historical account. The movie is loosely inspired by the book of Antonia Fraser. I believe that Coppola is a very outstanding director. Kirsten Dunst was simply perfect and,in my opinion,deserved more recognition than what she had. She gave a very honest and moving performance. She was fantastic as the naive,spoiled,sensitive,frivolous and unaware Queen. However,in the last scenes she offered a glimpse of the sad queen which were great. But this is only one of the many sides of that woman. Coppola didn't show us the other aspects of the Queen because she has other purpose that is humanizing the despised and misunderstood Queen of France. There is not her political side , her faults and her disadvantages .It's the private side that only few people knew and not her public side. The supporting cast is appropriate as well. To me the movie was very snubbed by the Academy since I believe that it should have been nominated for best director and best actress. The movie was never meant to be an in depth biography. It could not be a substitute of a book .Coppola portrayed the elements of her story that fit to her trilogy of films(Lost in translation and The virgin suicides).

1578573,1,B00005JPAS,"Sorry for my bad english in advance

 I thought it was a period drama but it ended up being a chick flick. On top of that a bad one.

PRO:
The costumes were gorgeous. Some historical details were present and quite amusing if you know about this time  period. For example when she had to leave everything that is Austrian behind, her clothes and even her mothers ring. Then  her hate for Madame Dubarry or her husbands liking in building locks. The scenes were opulent and music for the eye.

CONTRA:
The phrase ""let them eat cake"" never left her mouth. This phrase is from Jean-Jacques Rousseaus ""Confessions"", written when she was still a child.
The movie had a good start but you just come to know about her opulent lifestyle, make-up,gambling, costumes and et cetera. I missed Comtesse de la motte, or Cardinal Rohan the leader of the ""Affair of the Diamond Necklace"". I missed the finesse in speech and gesture, the ambigous little intrigues Versailles was infamous for. The movie let's you see the rebels as mindless villians and without deeper view on their live, experience and hardship.

Ok, some people say that this is a movie concentrating on feelings rather than to be a history lesson. Then why were the deaths of her two children portrayed in a collage of Portraits? And what is about her two miscarriages?
The ""lost love"" scene as Hans Axel von Fersen leaves for America and you see her running through Versailles and then laying on her bed is far to stretched out. In comparison, the death of her children must have been not interesting enough for the director. Shouldn't that be better emotional material for a movie about feelings?!
How can a lost love be more important than the death of your own children?

This movie was much to shallow and I had the feeling that Farmfolk tried to imitate the dekadent french nobility in a cheap stage-play(meaning the actors).
Well, the supporting act's were quite good and I even think that Kirsten Dunst is a good actress. She proved that in ""Interview with a Vampire"", but her performance in this movie is weak. I don't blame her but the script.

Sophia Ford-Coppola is just plain dissapointing. She should have pointed her attention to the Rokkoko in France, the live in Versailles, the historical persons,the French people in general and the little details, not just the Fashion and style.
She wasn't really interested in the historical figure that Marie Antoinette is but rather in the myth.
She wanted to compare the Hollywood life with Versailles,and Marie Antoinette with a tragic new pop star.
It was worth a try but it failed big time. Those Societies (Hollywood and Versailles) are far to different to compare with each other and I think it is insolent to even try. Hollywood has nothing to do with Versailles.
Hollywood's existence is unimportant and has no real influence. The Royal Family and French Nobility had Power over life and death, they had responsibilities, the nation was dependent and had to follow their whims. To think that Hollywood's Society is similar because of the arrogance,fortune and extravagant lifestyle, is ridiculous.

The music choice is not to my taste either, but shows that it is supposed to be a style-movie.
But you can't pull this off with every theme you come across. The French Revolution was devastating for France and Europe. The French revolution is to much connected with Marie Antoinette's life to play a little side-part at the end of this movie or any movie about this.
 Well, this movie can be enjoyable for people who don't know about this period and didn't get in touch with it through other mediums. For somebody who knows about this part of history and engaged themself with it, will not like this movie.

We see what happens if a rich Hollywood-Kid makes a movie about her own life in Rokkoko-style.

And why is Madame du Barry brunette in this movie. she was blond.

I did hang in there and watch the whole thing, but as the film progressed I was struck by the thought that the film-makers couldn't quite decide what they wanted this film to be.  For a while it seemed like a solid period drama, a but slow, a bit flat, but a drama.  Then the diretor seemed to change direction, and the combination of filming and music (e.g., during some of the carriage scenes) reminded me of some rather bad 1960s films, back in the day when film-making was striving to be ""artsy"" at the expence of watchability (is this a word?  well, whatever), and then there were times when it looked like the director was shooting music video for MTV.  It was hard to keep up.  It all seemed somewhat disjointed.

All in all, I have to say that it was ""OK.""  I doubt that I will ever watch it again, but 3 stars is all I can give it in good conscience.

This movie offers no substance or new insight whatsoever to this amazing chapter in history.

Now, if you want a look into the limited universe of the scions of a more creative generation, watch this movie for it's all about the underdeveloped personality of the director herself, whose culture seems to span from Rodeo Dr. to 1980s pop.  There is so much self-indulgence here that I must seriously ask if we are not witnessing a transformation in the art of film akin to the one in theater, where the old stories are played in contemporary environments.  If so, Coppola is achieving only 1/2 of the goal, for she should have planted the whole story much closer to home than bother with Versailles, the much touted Blahnik shoes and so on.

As film making goes, Marie Antoinette is a plain canonical piece, nothing is either ruined or achieved here.  From the extras, we learn that Sofia was encouraged to be herself in this movie, and her output is perceived accordingly even by the crew.  Jason Schwartzman, playing Louis XVI, even says that he stopped relying on books for his part; his cousin's script did it for him.

How could such a creative film receive so little recognition? Aside from the costumes, the film failed to gain praise and I truly cannot understand why. It's beautiful, emotional, and exceptionally unique. Ms. Coppola took a notorious historic figure and humanized her to leave the viewer feeling somewhat close to Marie Antoinette. What I enjoyed most about the film was the soundtrack. Music has the power to transform a film and this soundtrack most certainly did.

There is no plot.  There is no acting.

Only scenery and costume, costume and scenery.

The film won an Oscar for best costume design because, from the looks of it, literally all of the budget went into costume design.  Too bad there wasn't a farthing left for a script.

Other quibbles, minor in comparison: Coppola attached a soundtrack which is half 19th Century French court music and half 1990's  electronic pop music.  The latter is WILDLY jarring.

Every frame of this picture is a work of art. Slow, and dreamy--and insulated much like Marie Antoinette's life must have been at that time. I kept waiting for ""the poor"" to show up--the suffering to be exposed and then I realized it wasn't because it simply wasn't a part of her world.

At least until they boo it at Cannes. It is after midnight and your coach has turned into a pumpkin. Good luck getting your next project green-lighted.

--------------
Marie-Antoinette: It's not too much, is it?
Lonard: Oh, no!
==========

For me a telling moment was in the bonus footage where they showed Sofia's daddy saying his daughter came to him for advice and he said something like ""Just think of it like you're throwing a Marie-Antoinette party."" The film was very much like a Marie-Antoinette party, but what a hangover the next morning, cleaning up the mess.

--------------
Marie-Antoinette: Letting everyone down would be my greatest unhappiness.
==========

I liked some things in Marie Antoinette a lot, so let me mention some of them: I liked the cast and the location. I liked the costumes and the art direction. Sofia Coppola had Spanish footwear designer Manolo Blahnik create hundreds of specially made shoes for the film; and Ladure was chosen to make all of the brightly colored pastries and cakes. It was a period drama with great attention to detail, yet with a contemporary twist--a pair of blue Converse tennis shoes was deliberately left in one scene to make the connection that Marie-Antoinette was like a typical teenager. The soundtrack featured post punk 80's music like Bow Wow Wow's cover of Bo Diddley's ""I Want Candy"" The Cure's ""Plainsong"" and Adam Ant, who by the way, modeled a lot of his stage costumes on the Louis the XIV look. Sofia returned the favor when she based the look of Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), one of Marie-Antoinette's lovers, on Adam Ant.

A Marie-Antoinette with punk rock black lipstick says the famous quote attributed to her ""Let them eat cake!"" but then, the ""real"" Marie-Antoinette, sans the black lipstick, denies that she would ever say something so callous. Indeed, the not-so-hidden agenda of Marie Antoinette, the film by Sofia Coppola, was to show the human side to the doomed monarch.

This is where I stopped liking the film. Not that I object to the idea of making Marie-Antoinette sympathetic per se, I just think that the film did not accomplish this feat. Perhaps she also wanted to show that in spite of all the lavish parties, life at Versailles could be pretty boring. At two hours plus (that seemed like much, much more), she accomplished that. I fell asleep trying to watch it three nights in a row. And after using up all that time, she didn't really manage to tell what was going on. There was one cryptic scene where a portrait of Marie-Antoinette and her family was moved into a sparsely furnished hallway. Then moved again. What was the point? Was someone painted over or added? What? The birth of her first child, a daughter, was shown, but later, as she is forced to leave Versailles by an angry mob, she has more children. With all the emphasis on her producing an heir it seems like Sofia could have mentioned something about their births. As a story teller she went off on so many tangents, burning up over two hours of time, but neglected the basic plot.

Marie-Antoinette: So, I hear you like to make keys as a hobby?
Louis XVI: Yes.
Marie-Antoinette: And do you enjoy making keys?
Louis XVI: Obviously.
==========

Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI did his job--being the most boring person to ever sit on the throne of France. Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, Danny Huston, and Steve Coogan are all very talented, but their talents were largely wasted here. Even Kirsten Dunst (who acts very well here BTW) was better utilized in Bring It On, where she managed to make the head of the cheerleading squad at a privileged school who had stolen all of their winning routines from a school in Compton sympathetic. Marie-Antoinette? Not so much. I tend to agree with the mobs, and Robespierre, and the Red Queen: ""Off with her head!""

1578722,3,B00005JPAS,"I watched this movie when it came out in 2006 and I was hopelessly lost and confused by everything. I was confused by the choppy scenes and half the time I didn't know what they were doing. But recently I just came back from a trip to Paris in which I visited Versailles and I learned all about Marie Antoinette and her spending. After I came back fully informed by the history of Versailles, the movie seemed much clearer to me and I was actually interested in the movie (unlike the first time I watched it where due to my confusion I was left bored). So if you're going to watch this movie, I STRONGLY recommend you do some basic research of Marie Antoinette.

But despite the fact that it is confusing, I have to give props to Sofie Copolla for the soundtrack. I don't know how she did it but she made Classical era music and retro 80's punk rock work together in harmony (no pun intended) to create and amazing soundtrack.

To be honest, I'm still not sure what happens, but as soon as you turn it on, you are lost in the XVII century France.

The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie.

If they actually watched the trailer beforehand, they'd realize that it's a stylish adaptation that contains modern music, so no excuse there.

I've heard many criticisms of this film, so I'll attempt to address them.

Criticism #1: Not every detail in her life is shown.

 ...such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace incident, her imprisonment, and subsequent execution, though once again, this is NOT a BBC miniseries or History Channel biography. Sofia Coppola herself has stated in numerous interviews that she was never trying to make a historical biopic.

As Roger Ebert brilliantly put it: ""No, the picture is not informative and detailed about the actual politics of the period. That is because we are entirely within Marie's world. And it is contained within Versailles, which shuts out all external reality. It is a self-governing architectural island, like Kane's Xanadu, that shuts out politics, reality, poverty, society.""

Criticism #2: None of their accents are the same/ Why aren't they speaking like Hugh Grant?/ Ew they are using American accents!

I don't really know what accent people assume they're supposed to adopt, a stereotypical posh English accent? That would have been just as inaccurate, for the majority would have spoken French at court. Might as well let the actors keep their natural accents, for then the audience won't get distracted by attempts that fall short. And really, one can argue that the differences in their English-speaking accents could translate well for differences in French accents, since English is standing in for French.

Criticism #3: Modern music is used.

The most popular criticism I've heard is over the use of modern music, though this is probably what really made me love the film. Sofia Coppola was trying to capture a teenager's world and feelings, and I think she hit the perfect note. Some feel that this made it too catered (or even dumbed down) for the younger audience, but really, what's wrong with making a connection to that particular age group? This is, after all, a film about a teenager. A teenager from the 18th century born into royalty who lived a life of wealth, privilege and influence, yes, but a teenager nonetheless.

Roger Ebert continued to say in his review: ""Coppola has been criticized in some circles for her use of a contemporary pop overlay -- hit songs, incongruous dialogue, jarring intrusions of the Now upon the Then. But no one ever lives as Then; it is always Now. Many characters in historical films seem somehow aware that they are living in the past. Marie seems to think she is a teenager living in the present, which of course she is -- and the contemporary pop references invite the audience to share her present with ours.""

Criticism #4: It's boring.

Well, go watch Transformers then. If you were bored through this, then period pieces in general must not be your thing. I don't think your dislike has anything to do with Coppola's direction then.

Seriously though, this whole movie was such lovely eye candy; so full of color and life. I could go on and on about the clothes and locations and flowers and pastries and champagne featured throughout. It's very aesthetically-pleasing. Coppola perfectly captured the youthfulness and decadence, as well as the gossiping, sycophantic society of that era, and managed to make it accessible and pleasurable to watch. I think Marie Antoinette would have approved.",1266105600,4,3643,5.03156146179402

1578782,2,B00005JPAS,"For quite some time, this movie has been on my to-view list.  So when I was perusing the library, I checked it out.  And then my sister and I watched it.  And then I found out why I hadn't viewed it earlier.
The plot (well, what there is of a plot) can be summed up in one sentence: See Marie Antoinette live extravagantly.  Marie Antoinette marries into the French Court, goes to Versailles, spends lots of money, and basically lounges around.
Before I swing the axe on this film, let me detail some of the highlights.  Beautiful scenery and costumes.  I found out it won an Academy Award for costume design, and I believe it was well-earned.  The costumes looked accurate (my sister is taking art history and, for the most part, found the film to be fairly accurate in this regard) and appropriate for the time period.  The surroundings were, I found out, actually filmed in Versailles.  Kudos to whomever was able to procure that, as it looks very gorgeous and realistic.
But other than eye candy, there really isn't anything to this movie.  Kirsten Dunst does a so-so performance as the doomed Austrian queen of France.  One thing is certain: while she may not look the part of a 18th century French royalty, she can play vacuous well.  But then all she had to really do to sell that part is throw dice, try on shoes, sip champagne, or eat pastries.  Jason Schwartzmann was very amusing as her husband, and I felt he did okay, but, when he isn't given much to act with (other than riding away or falling asleep), you can't quite get a feeling.  Most of the actors (Asia Argento, Rose Byrne, Rip Torn, the woman who played Marie's mother)  were okay...but there was so little script, it was hard to hail their performances as anything extraordinary.
A brief glance at Wikipedia showed that the historical accuracy was moderately high for a Hollywood film, but I bemoan the loss of the French Revolution.  Where are the political machinations?  Where are the destitute people in the streets?  Why wasn't more mention made of Marie's village or her increasing interest in politics or on how much money she spent?  These are very important parts to Marie's life; parts that are glaringly missing.
And the ending!  I might have given this 3 stars, but the conclusion, the blankess you are left with...horrible!  No idea is given what happens to Marie Antoinette after leaving Versailles...only an empty palace bedroom.  How can you call this a story of Marie Antoinette when you only see a few sparse years of her life, during which all she does is gamble and shop?  If you aren't going to end with her on the guillotine, at least give us some idea as to her fate!
Overall, I am not impressed.  I do credit the film with generating in me an interest in the real Marie Antoinette's life, but other than that and some pretty surroundings and costumes, there really isn't anything to this film.  View only if you're in the mood for some petit fours and be prepared for an upset stomach afterwards.

There was more time dedicated to food and romping in the garden surrounding Marie Antoinette's Petite Trion than to the entertaining history behind the story.  If you didn't know the history, at the end of the film, you might even think that the Royal Family were off for a weekend on the French Riviera.",1253750400,2,691,4.922413793103448
1578785,1,B00005JPAS,"""Marie Antoinette"" is the name of a film made in 1938 by the great W.S. Van Dyke (Director), the wonderful Norma Shearer (Marie Antoinette), the brilliant Robert Morley (Louis XVI), the talented Tyrone Power, the inimitable John Barrymore, the imposing Joseph Schildkraut, and others whose names will be forever enshrined in film history for this and other grand achievements.

""Marie Antoinette"" is also the name of a film made in 2006 by the uncoordinated Sofia Coppola (Director), the ditzy Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), the ineffectual Jason Schwarzman (Louis XVI), the unfortunate Rip Torn (who must nave been duped, bribed, or blackmailed), and others who will spend much of their later careers trying to live down the fiasco.

This review is of course about the latter.  I can understand why some reviewers actually like the thing.  It's a pretty puff piece, a big fluffball of empty calories - cinematic junk food.  In this case, it's not super-salty potato chips, but packing peanuts soaked the dregs of a deep-fat fryer.  It's hard to resist this sort of toothsome slop - else most of the fast-food traps would be out of business.

The story of Marie Antoinette is a sad one, and in the end she suffered the fate that most members of her class richly deserved.  This story needs to be told with empathy and dignity.  In this film there is some feeble attempt at the former, but absolutely none of the latter.

The banality of the script is almost iconic, leaping like a starved carnivore from clich to clich.  Amazingly, the script touches effectively on the point that ""Let them eat cake"" (literally, ""brioche"") may not have said by Marie Antoinette at all.  In fact the script does a fair job of avoiding historical howlers.

We can at least say that the script gets the acting it deserves - as Dorothy Parker once said of Katharine Hepburn, no less - running ""the gamut of emotions from A to B"".  The most important problem with the script is where it stops.

The connection of Marie Antoinette with the great French Revolution is fundamental.  In this film, the Revolution takes place with scarcely any intimation that it's brewing.  But the Revolution begins on schedule anyway, but is barely under way when the film ends.  Marie Antoinette's life in the first years of the Revolution, and her execution particularly, may as well not have happened so far as this film is concerned.  This is even more lame than (for instance) ending the story of Cinderella at the point when she arrives home after running away from the ball.  (Of course, I'll bet you that most of any modern audience will sit there gaping, saying to themselves, ""I wonder what happened to her after that"".  Such is the state of modern education.)

Indubitably, the lamest part of this ""Marie Antoinette"" is the musical (if you can call it that) score.  It's not merely lame, it's tawdry and terminally stupid.  When it's not insipid musak, it's rock.  Now, rock music is incapable of any real emotional content whatsoever.  It's OK for car chases, fist fights, shoot-outs, tractor pulls, monster trucks, unbridled raunchiness, and other events of more than usual empty mindlessness.  It's totally unsuitable for any film that aspires to some degree of quality.  The quantity of this stuff is a good indicator of the depths to which the film sinks.

There is a little decent music in the film, every note of it composed during the period of Marie Antoinette's life or before.  Even there, the film's penchant for cheap shots shines (if that's the word) through.  Recall the several little episodes when Marie Antoinette is awakened and dressed in the morning.  The music is Vivaldi's Concerto for Diverse Instruments.  Where have we heard that before?  Remember ""All That Jazz""?  This is the music that plays during Roy Scheider's wake-up ritual.  ""Marie Antoinette"" uses some good music to good purpose and even then it's just a cheap rip-off of another film.

I suppose it can be said that ""Marie Antoinette"" has its good points.  The sets and costumes are very bright, cheery, and not inaccurate.  On the other hand, the genuine tawdriness of late 18th-Century French fashion serves admirably to set off the equally genuine tawdriness of the film.  The same may be said for the complete absence of Voltaire as a character.  After all, why bring out philosophy when you can trot out titillating assertions that Marie Antoinette was a slut.",1250812800,11,4427,4.872824631860777
1578786,1,B00005JPAS,"Do not consider this movie without first seeing Norma Shearer's 1938 version, which was at least closer to the historical truth in interpretation. This version has better costumes and does relate some incidents that were true, but it is so bland and vapid and Kirsten Dunst is so one-dimensional as the queen that one can not understand why the Revolution even happened.
With plenty of actresses that would have done a superb job, such as Cate Blanchett, I don't comprehend this choice that resulted in one of the most limited, dull interpretations possible. The limitation of all the action to Versailles is also incomprehensible because Marie Antoinette spent a lot of time in Paris during her youth.
There is no insight into the queen's personality that would lead you to suspect that she would become the heroine and martyr of the Revolution,  an image that still haunts the French Republic today and is the sole driving force in her historical interest.
The whole movie is forgettable and does NOT resemble the Antonia fraser book, ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" which is an excellent, insightful biography on the Queen, and probably the best that is available in English.

My loss!

""Marie Antoinette"" is a wonderfully told tale about ""the Austrian's"" rise to the court of France and then the sad downfall brought about by the Revolution.  True, there are some deliberate anachronisms in the film but they don't take away from the story.  Visually, the movie is gorgeous but if that's all there was, it would be shallow.  I enjoyed the storyline and the acting from all the various people involved - Molly Shannon and Judy Davis in the same movie?  Really?  Yet, Sofia Coppola makes it work.

A real bonus is that the movie was filmed on location at the palace of Versailles and the Petit Trianon and not on a reconstructed back lot.

It's humor is subtle, and its storytelling devices are uncommon--not new, just uncommon.
This movie uses modern music as it's soundtrack, along with period appropriate pieces, but I didn't not find that the modern songs stood out me nearly as awkwardly as they did in, say, A Knight's Tale. They almost seemed to fit. And of course they did. The main objective of this movie is to portray Marie Antoinette's life of royalty as a modern day rock star.
Sofia Coppola uses imagery and fantastic colors and costumes and music and stunning videography to do much of the talking.  The irony is even though her lifestyle is outrageous, the way she is presented also makes her very real.
Like I said, it's subtle and artsy, and in a world of in-your-face plot, it's easy to understand why so many may not like it. But if you come to it with an open mind, you just might find it to be a really cool, refreshingly different sort of movie.",1245196800,2,1146,4.457142857142857

Why would anybody want to watch a movie about Marie Antoinette? Oh, maybe to know more about the details that lead up to the beheading that immortalized her name perhaps?

1578902,4,B00005JPAS,"Lavish, extravagant, ambitious.  These are probably some of the best adjectives to describe Sophia Coppola's MARIE ANTOINETTE.  Within seconds of the opening, the viewers know that this is not your usual period drama.  If the offbeat music is not hint enough, watch how Kirsten Dunst lays on a chaise having her nails done while casually licking the icing off a cake, before turning to the camera with a smug look.  One immediately thinks of the phrase Marie Antoinette was infamous for and you know that the film would be filled with many irony.

Kirsten Dunst plays the title role with great aplomb capturing the innocence and naivet of a young Marie Antoinette sent to France like a lamb to slaughter for political reason.  Completely unprepared for her new life, she finds herself lost in a labyrinth of bewildering and ludicrously high expectations where her every move is magnified by the French court, including the very much delayed consummation of her marriage to Louis XVI.  The supporting cast plays their role fabulously - a testament to Coppola's ability to draw out great performances from her actors.  Most notable of these are Rip Torn as Louis XV, who elicited some giggle when he asked about how his future daughter-in-law's breasts looked; and also Judy Davis as the Comtesse de Noailles who acted as Marie Antoinette's teacher in the proper decorum as considered by the French nobility.  I thought it was brilliantly absurd how, during the dauphine's morning ritual of getting dressed and primped, Marie Antoinette is left standing completely naked in the cold as the Comtesse explains to her that the highest ranked lady in the room gets the honor.  The dauphine is left waiting as one lady after another, each one ranking higher than the one before, enters the room and thus gets the said honor of dressing her.  This is just one of the many digs at the frivolous life that the ill-fated queen lived.  One cannot help but laugh at such moments due to their sheer absurdity.

Sure enough, the film does not sustain the historical accuracy of the life of the infamous title character, but one must view this film as a fun take on Marie Antoinette's life and simply enjoy the lavishness of the production and the beautiful images presented throughout the film.  Indeed, one should think of MARIE ANTOINETTE as an artful confection of stunning imagery and lavish costume.

I also found Kirsten Dunst quite refreshing as well, perfectly conveying the wide-eyed ingenue princess upon her arrival to Versailles and later, the queen resigned to her fate at the hands of people I believe she cared for second only to her beloved Austrians.  Go into this movie with an open mind and enjoy the colorful sights and sounds, but believe me when I say there is a message here under all the candy coating and that is bad PR can kill a person's reputation and in Marie's case, killed her physically as well.",1230595200,2,848,4.6092715231788075

In the film they have her reading propaganda where it stated she said that and she laughes saying she never did. It was wrongly attributed to her a long time ago and the attribution stuck but it was never her that said that.

There seems to me elements of truth to this but I took it all in very lightly while looking at beautiful and elaborate costumes, the Palace of Versailles, the wigs, the shoes, the food and pastries, all the while listening to that New Wave/""alternative"" soundtrack. I think we're exploring the personal and subjective here more than the political and historical... And we are enjoying playing dress-up.

1578962,3,B00005JPAS,"""Marie Antoinette"" is utterly ravishing to look at and, at last, peculiarly touching in a way its histrionics and the director's disastrous choices should have precluded.  A real woman emerges from the manifestly surreal structure of this film - but that isn't because of Coppola's use of vernacular English and modern pop music in stark contrast to the environment of 18th century Versailles - it's because of Kirsten Dunst's talents.

It is clear that, as others have pointed out, Coppola researched the living daylights out of the era.  Scrupulous attention is paid to food, dress, entertainment, hairdos, etc.  What that research must also have turned up, and that Coppola chose to ignore in service to her quaint vision, is that Versailles was one of the most formal places ever to exist on the planet.  Even in French its denizens would not have used the vernacular to each other, let alone her friends fall all over the French Queen with a familiarity that would never have existed! Louis XVI's court was ruled by a rigid formality that would make the constraints of Victoria's reign look easy-going by comparison. Were it not for the wistful charm brought to her portrayal of Marie Antoinette by the truly gifted young Dunst, this would have been a total, rather than an honorable failure.

In omitting the crushing formality of Louis XVI's court, which served to insulate him and his wife from events taking place just beyond their vast, manicured lawns, Coppola omits a crucial element of the monarchy's downfall.  It is rather like making ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" and leaving out the Romanov's history of absolute rule.  In her distrust of her audience's ability to empathize with someone who doesn't talk like them, Coppola ends by sacrificing necessary historical context to support why Marie and Louis are on their way to their deaths in the final frames, and makes insupportable assumptions about how they related to each other and their friends.  A few references to Marie's spendthrift ways just aren't enough to support the astonishing downfall of the last of the French kings.  Barely any mention is made of the revolution brewing outside the gates until someone runs in with the news that the Bastille has been stormed.  To fail to enlighten us about the events leading up to Marie's fate is in some sense to fail to enlighten us about the woman herself - they are inextricably intertwined.

One example of the historical disconnect is the the familiar way in which Marie and her ladies and courtiers lie around together gossiping and eating and shopping - it looks like nothing so much as an episode of ""Sex and the City"" in 18th century clothing.  The fun Marie seems to have with these friends as she wanders through gardens, throws parties, and tries  on new clothes, etc., doesn't support her passionate desire to escape to Trianon, her pastoral alternative from Versailles to a place more ""natural"".

The director's ""time warp"" gimmick only serves to draw attention to the gimmick itself, and distract from characterization and story.  Anything less likely to focus the audience on Marie's amorous state of mind after she meets the handsome Swedish guardsman than a recent (and substandard, in my opinion) cover of ""Fools Rush In"" can scarecely be imagined - all one thinks is, ""Oh, listen, it's ""Fools Rush In"" right in the middle of a film about Marie Antoinette in the 18th century!  How cute!""

Marie's difficulties at the French court have been well recorded by history: the hostility she met there, exacerbated by her failure to bear an heir for so long, her homesickness, her initial isolation, and her young husband's difficulties in the marriage bed.  The rest of the cast, especially Jason Schwartzman as the benighted Louis, do as well as they can in the jangled time warp gimmick that robs their story of one of its crucial underpinnings.  But essentially they are working against their own interests.

The backdrop of modern English and pop music against 18th century Versailles is interesting for about ten minutes.  One gets the point quickly and then it palls just as quickly.  This film is worth seeing for Dunst's sweet performance and for the amazing physical production, but, finally, this is yet another film that substitutes gimmick for content.  It is as if American filmmakers can't function intellectually on a par with history - they seem to feel compelled to reassure their audiences that this won't be too hard to understand or absorb.

The visuals were light and frothy but the soundtrack was aggressively modern, heavy and racing - too aggressive for this light fairytale painting.

In Lost in Translation, we had Charlotte, who'd rather karaoke-it-up with Bill Murray than listen to her husband drone about his photography shoot in neon-bright Tokyo.  Now, she brings us the last Queen of France, most often linked to the classically obnoxious phrase ""Let them eat cake"" and the decline of the aristocracy, though here is no brighter than a dazed-out mall girl, shopping sale to sale and partying til the sun comes up.

It's undeniable that the French New Wave technique Coppola uses over and over gives you a feeling of personal vulnerability that allows you to understand how Marie Antoinette must've felt and how it must've been to live in such an ancient and opulent time.  Like the alienation films of Antonioni or the youthful romps of early Godard, you get a sense of inclusion that scratches the blankness of many Hollywood films.  When Marie looks confused, you feel confused.  When she cries, you can feel the pain.  When she parties off to 80's New Wave and postpunk giddiness, you want to become a decadent royal and feast on pastries, downing them with Dom Perignon.  This is not the kind of historical drama that you would watch in school or even see from Spielberg.  This is the kinda thing that only a girl who dropped out of art school, knew the best bands, and favored mood over plot could make.  This is definitely the Phil Spector of Costume Dramas; this one's for the kiddies.

Like a soul-searching rich girl on an MTV reality series, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst, living up to her teen queen movie status) bumps through Versailles with curiosity and restraint, choosing her friends with ease and learning the protocol of which the inhabitants of her new world live by.  Married to the future king, the chubby and clumsy Louis XVI (adorably by Jason Schwartzmann), who doesn't seem to show much interest in what she likes or wants, Marie finds herself indulging in shopping and pastries, diamonds and play dates with the Comtesse and the Duchess, trying to rid herself from the ennui that pervades the palace walls.

It isn't until Louis's grandpa croaks and she's Queen, when she then begins to enjoy her life.  Her 18th birthday rivals any of that on Super Sweet 16 and her clique is filled with the most lush and the most extravagant of them all.  While the country begins to support America, Marie finally gives birth to a child (though-shock!-a GIRL), an act that gives her the keys to her own little retreat, Petit Trianon.  There she reads Rousseau in milk-maid couture to her equally-chic crowd while they pick berries, longing to be apart of nature.  It's the scenes in which she and her daughter are roaming the fields in misdirection that make you rethink the whole guillotine thing.  Even her whole affair with that Swedish Dior model/soldier after the Revolutionary War, deserves a nudge of sympathy.  I mean, have you SEEN Louis?

OK, you know the rest of the story, but Sofia conveys it with an indifference and innocence that surpasses the snooty elitists of Masterpiece Theater.  Replaced paintings represent the loss of a child.  A misclap at the opera forces the decline of an era.  The whole time we watch this sad girl who had no idea what she was doing, we can only witness the kind of scrutiny and expectations she is to live by, that ultimately get her in the most of trouble.  In this, we're reminded of the fallen paparazzi princesses who have only but inspired an entire generation of party goers.  We're also, in a way, reminded of ourselves at that young adolescent age when immortality was foremost.

A lot of people gives this movie a lot of flack for its prettiness and lack of whatever but after Lost in Translation, Sofia knew she could do whatever the hell she wanted and if she wanted to make a synthesized bio-pic fit for Molly Ringwald about 18th century French royalty, then why not?  I have watched this movie at least 50 times now and never get tired of a moment.  I am always reminded of some memory in my high school life when I felt as she did or partied as she did or laughed with my friends as she did.  This movie is the equivalent of a good mixtape with its disjointed scenes and bulbous beauty, declaring a sense of identity and never turning back.  Though earlier, I stated that this one is ""for the kiddies,"" this is not just a ""girl"" movie or a ""teen"" movie.  This is actually for anyone who has ever experienced happy moments and knows what it's like to realize that it's all gone and it's never coming back.  It's for anyone who has been under pressure, been confused, been alienated, and been neglected.

I have a feeling in 10 years, this will be considered a classic.  All-time or cult?  That's up to the rest of you.",1218326400,4,4955,4.648679678530425
1578966,5,B00005JPAS,"I see many people complaining that the movie doesn't give much attention to the whole Revolution fuss. Of course, in a story dealing with Marie Antoinette, one would have expected the revolution to be the central point of it all. But this is the very differential of this movie: it gives you an intimate picture of the queen, her life and her reality - even if that reality was not in accordance to the one of her people. Not that it was good or right, but that's how it was. Period.
And that's what i liked about it. The French Revolution - it's why's, how's, when's, you should have learnt in your history class. This is NOT a movie that will teach you history. This is a movie that will show you the infamous and despised Marie Antoinette from another point of view.

The movie is colorful, and has a wonderful light! It's pleasing to watch it, even in the balls, with all the music and movement, you don't get a headache, because it's really...smooth. The colors are alive, but no psychedelic. The soundtrack is fantastic - i loved how Sofia Coppola mixed old and modern music, and it doesn't feel awkward, The costumes are fantastic, and the fact that they filmed it all in the real Versailles, it's no wonder all seems so true. I usually don't care much about Kirsten Dunst, but she's nice here too...Coppola did managed to get a good work from an actress that is sorta uninspiring sometimes.

I agree, maybe Marie Antoinette is a bit fantasized. But as i said, this a movie you'll watch for fun, maybe for the opportunity of seeing hated Marie Antoinette in a different light. But it's not your history class. It's not her complete biography, several facts are missing, because you just cannot put one person's ENTIRE lifetime in a single movie. If you want it, read Antonia Fraser's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marie-Antoinette-The-Journey/dp/0385489498/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marie Antoinette: The Journey</a>"", or Evelyne Lever's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marie-Antoinette-The-Last-Queen-of-France/dp/0312283334/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marie Antoinette: The Last Queen of France</a>"". As for the movie, enjoy it, the light, the beauty, the songs, the love, everything!

1578967,3,B00005JPAS,"Nothing makes me happier than huge powdered wigs, beautiful gowns with wide farthingales, riding to hounds, fans, feathers, fruit, and fops. But there was way too much of that here. I almost overdosed on opulence. I got what director Sofia Coppola was trying to do, but I felt like I was watching today's Hollywood crew of ""ne'er do wells"": Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Nicole Richie, etc.

This movie was less about ""Marie Antoinette"" than it was about her husband's impotence (the result of a physical problem eventually corrected by surgery, something not revealed here). It was painful to watch and wait for 75 minutes until Louis XVI, an expert locksmith, was able to get his ""key"" in the door. Later, Marie's ""booty calls"" with the sexy Count Fersen (Jamie Doman) seemed like porn after scene after scene waiting for the Dauphin's ""cannon"" to blow. With no reference to time passing, it seemed that the non-consummation of the royal marriage went on for decades. It wasn't until Marie had some kids did we get some idea of the time, although the kids were growing up like children on soap operas - one minute they are in a cradle, the next they are going to law school. And it appeared as if the Swedish Count was the real ""baby daddy"" of Marie Antoinette's second child, the male heir to the throne.

Many of the scenes, while lush and beautifully filmed, went on way too long, adding nothing to the story (there were so many hunt scenes, I was about to shoot myself!). Kirsten Dunst, in the title role, was lovely, child-like, and ethereal. She had you believing that Marie Antoinette really said ""Let them eat cake"", with her birthday cake and kazillion pastries shown throughout looking as if they were baked by ""The Ace of Cakes"". While I loved the contemporary soundtrack (produced by Brian Reitzeil), the 1940s standard hit single ""Fools Rush In"", sung by a vocally-challenged chanteuse, was reminiscent of early Mary J. Blige, which made the fillings in my teeth hurt! The sets were gorgeous (it's hard to mess up Versailles and Le Petit Trianon), but the story was weak, inaccurate and, at times, just ridiculous. Take note of the scene with Marie buying shoes like she was at a Jimmy Choo sample sale - it shows a pair royal Chuck Taylors! I was expecting Snoop Dogg to be at the Bal Masque!

The only compliment I have is very minor. The production and costume designers kept the colors worn and around the aristocracy soft, with pinks, blues, mints, and yellows. With everything looking like a surgary icing-covered pastry, you could almost taste the decadence and waste of the time while the common people of France were starving. But we never actually saw any poor people....except for the ghetto-fabulous Madam Du Barry (Asia Argente), mistress of the licentious Louis XV (Rip Torn), Marie Antoinette's father-in-law. A former ""woman of the streets"", du Barry she actually burps loudly at a state dinner, among other coarse actions. While everyone else at Versailles seemed to have been given the Limited Edition Easter Set of Crayolas, du Barry only got the box of 8 colors - and she preferred using the red, black, and blue crayons, with great abandon. She stood out of the movie like a sore thumb which, of course, was the point. Now, that I got.

I know that young Marie Antoinette was merely a political pawn between France and her own Austria. She had been shipped off to have a baby for the future teen king of France, in order to cement relations between the two countries. At age 14, Marie did what teenagers do when they have nothing to do and the American Express Black - wear the numbers off the card! But after 2 hours of watching overspending and aborted sexual relations, I couldn't wait to see ""The National Razor"", le guillotine. I wanted to chop off Coppola's head for wasting all of that satin! But the movie never even went that far - it failed like Louis in bed.

Judy Davis, Marianne Faithful, Rip Torn, Jason Schwartzman, Jamie Doman, and the rest were well cast here. Molly Shannon was so believable that I still don't remember seeing her. All of the little dogs were good, too. But the end titles, which came out of the blue, were more interesting than this movie. I didn't bother to see if there were deleted scenes on this disc - I wished the whole movie had been deleted!",1217721600,,4320,4.693931398416886
1578968,4,B00005JPAS,"The movie was visually stunning. The scenery, the costumes, the colors, everything just ""popped""!
I didn't really care for the modern music as the soundtrack (hence, the 4 stars) but I see why it was chosen. It gives us the sense that Marie Antoinette was just like us, not some name in a textbook. She was young and wild and wanted the freedom to do so, regardless if she was the Queen of France or not.
I LOVED Kirsten Dunst in this role. You can really see how Marie Antoinette grows throughout the film. From a young girl, to a mother, to her husband's equal. The film is done from her perspective, so there's no fighting or blood and gore. And from what I have read, it was a pretty accurate portrayal of her too.
There are mixed reviews on this movie, and if you are even the slightest bit interested, it's worth at least renting.",1217635200,2,836,4.365384615384615

This film was done perfectly well in my opinion. It wasn't supposed to be a strict interpretation. This was not aired on BBC (as much as I love BBC). This was a creative approach to history.

I mean look at the good. 1) Excellent casting. 2)Gorgeous costumes. 3) Upbeat, classic yet modern music that kept the movies light tone and let's not forget... 4)It showed the luxury that the court all lived in wonderfully. You saw the food, the shopping, the lavish parties, the way they brushed off other cares. You watched her rise and fall. You could feel the court hate/love/hate her.

Overall, it was well done.",1216339200,,698,4.568
1579021,5,B00005JPAS,"What I do in life is read histories. It is an obsession with me to ""be in time"" - to see our life now as being history as we live it. Day to day life just doesn't translate into experience to reflect upon, not until well after the fact.
Point is, that the 18th century was pretty rockin and rollin. Look at it...there was never a time so radical and so philosophically In Your Face. Maybe Greece, maybe China, but we digress.
Now really, would we choose to be a culture that includes Reality TV, Fast Food, and paperback romances? Maybe - I love me some Top Chef, French Fries and...well, many people do like to read romances, and I say go for it if that's what makes you feel good. We don't choose our surroundings.
This retelling of Marie Antoinette's story fascinates me because we have this girl born into her own circumstances (and aren't we all), and she gets on with it. Can any of us see our outcome, can we even guess at the world when we're 14?
An 80's soundtrack? Sure. Listen to Mozart, Beethoven, endless unknown composers who are just as interesting - it's music that is happening to you NOW, which is exactly what history is.
This movie makes me love this girl - and this boy - because that's exactly what they were at the time. Do you think that if you were born a queen you'd see Your Place in the World, even if you were looking for it? Not if you were a teenager. Not if you were a young mother with your very own child. Not if you were partying down with your arranged husband, and find yourself having a good time anyway. Not if you've discovered lust. Not as if anybody around you ever put a book in your hand to take you away from yourself.
I seek out movies like this, because I adore the vision of time as a fiction. Whenever you're alive is when it's happening.

Not to mention Kirsten Dunst who is someone I'd like to have a conversation with -  girl seems to see sompin out there, I like her I think.",1216339200,8,1928,4.236413043478261
1579022,5,B00005JPAS,"This is one of my favorite movies.  People had some complaints about this film though, that it didn't portray all of her life, especially her horrible death.  But this was Sophia Coppolla's view of how she wanted Marie Antoinette to be portrayed and remembered.  She wanted to show the beautiful, happy, even fun life that Marie Antoinette lived, not her sad ending.  The cinematography is superb.  The colors are brilliant, bright and beautiful.  Kirsten Dunst portrays Marie Antoinette as an elegant, fun-loving, sweet girl, someone you'd love to have as a friend.  Sophia Coppolla adds modern music to the film, to make us imagine Marie Antoinette as a modern girl living today.  Marie Antoinette in the film is someone we'd like to be.  A beautiful princess, living a beautiful life in a beautiful palace, surrounded by beautiful things. Wearing the most beautiful clothes, and wearing very cool wigs and hairstyles, and enjoying the most luscious desserts, champagne,  wearing beautiful shoes, and playing with her cute little dogs.  This truly is a girl flick, and it just makes you feel good, and the acting isn't bad either.  As far as cinematography goes, it's beautiful visually, and to me, that makes it a cinematographic masterpiece.  This movie is a feast for the senses.",1215475200,3,1284,5.028436018957346
1579023,4,B00005JPAS,"The main characters are protrayed without the French or Austrian accents. (but this doesn't really matter, because this movie is not based upon an accurate detailed biography).  Kirsten Dunst shows purety of heart as a young, virgin Marie Antionette.  The movie is beautifully filmed with it's historically correct grand rooms, bedrooms and courtyards.  Carriages with white horses and gold, detailed embellishments on doors and beautiful rooms. Drawn by hand playing cards-Esquisite deserts-beautiful hair and hats, lots of details.  A young virgin girl's fairy-tale dream, to marry a prince and to live in nobility. A fashion statement in that period of time showing detail of shoes and dresses (one scene of her numerous shoes, shows a brief tennis converse type shoe- I'm sure in was put in the movie for fun to see if anyone notices it! There are a few subtle dashes of humor sprinkled in the movie) The majority of the historical and political accuracy of events are omitted.  Part of the music is modern music of today, but not all of it. (I believe it is added to reach the young viewers of today, to show to them that she was just a regular girl, wanting to be loved and wanting to have fun.)  This movie greatly focuses on the newlywed years of the young Marie A., she is frustrated and she does not know why she is rejected sexually by her husband in the early years of their marriage. She is ridiculed and pressured to produce an heir to the throne. In my opinion, she rebelles with lavish parties, gambling and dress. The two young rulers are misguided in everyway-personally and politically. (Not advisable for young children to see her brief nude back and rear end when she changes from her former Austrian clothes to her new French clothes and her brief love scene with the Swedish Officer.)  She eventually settles and matures into a woman, after the birth of her children and death of her baby.  There is absolutely no violence and does not show her or her husband's beheading or the horrible death of her son and their horrific torture in their last couple of years of their lives.  In that respect it is relatively pleasant to watch and is non-disturbing, which is refreshing today, since there is so much violence and sex in movies- but keep in mind that this movie is not an entirely accurate biography.

The movie itself will not make anyone's top 1000, as there isn't much to mention for plot. However, this is not to say that the movie is not true to historical Marie Antoinette and her circumstance, etc. (It is. Read a bio of Marie.)

1579025,3,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette is perhaps one of the most famous women who ever lived.  Exactly how did this woman of privilage go down in history as being one of the most reviled and hated?  This movie gives some insight on a few slightly off center methods.

Born into the royal family of Austria, Marie Antoinette was sent to marry the crown prince of France, the doomed Louis XVI, in a strictly political rather than a love situation.  The costuming and sets are beautiful if not completely decadent, but how could anything not be in the palace of Versailles?  Unsure of herself, plus not knowing what to do with a husband who is more interested in his hobby of key making rather than her, Marie creates a core group of friends and has fun.  She parties and has a great time.

The music was panned in this, as it truly did not fit at all.  Post punk rock music for 18th centure France?  Doesn't work.  That's what turned me off, the blatant marketing tactic, even casting Maryanne Faithfull as the Queen of Austria in a bit part.

Eventually, Marie finds herself under pressure to produce and heir when her in-laws start having babies and the court starts gossiping.  She does produce the much needed for heir, thinking that this will be the end of her official duties.  The rest of the movie only hints at what will be their fate.  Marie and the others at court, as it seemed, really had no idea of what was going on outside the palace doors nor across the ocean.  Instead, Louis XVI would make some bad decissions, but she would stand by him.  Perhaps not as a wife or supporting him in his political decissions, but because she was truly ignorant.

The movie ends at a very curious point.  Those who know their history know what their fate would be, but the movie chose to end at a point where if one didn't know anything about history you would be guesssing.  Marie and Louis flee the palace, going off as the mobs were closing in on them.  They were saying good-bye to their lives as royalty, and looking to an uncertain future.  THE END.  I would have liked to have seen just a little bit more.  This ending and the soundtrack left me lukewarm about it.",1213488000,,2149,4.439897698209719
1579026,3,B00005JPAS,"This period of French history is my favorite to study, yet somehow, this movie makes me cringe.

I think the movie is an excellent collection of beautiful scenes and fun episodes of frivolity.  However, Coppola's disregard for making her audience understand and feel for Marie made this movie boring and trite.  I never once felt like I could identify with any character.  All of them seemed emotionally removed from the film.  I could understand how this would play up to the characterization of the time, but it was poorly done nonetheless.

The movie is pretentious and overdone.  It was trying too hard to be aloof and cold, yet visually stunning.  The visuals remind me of a Pleasures perfume commercial--okay for a commercial, but not so good for a movie (to see this hazy, romantic cinematography done well, try the 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley).  Understanding Marie and Louis's demise was difficult.  Understanding Marie's true feelings was also difficult.

I did not mind the soundtrack, I actually enjoy it.  There is no better way to convey the decadence and mindlessness of the time than comparing it to the 1980s.

It is a fun movie that should be taken lightly as a period spectacle.",1212019200,2,1215,4.897058823529412

The main plot line that kept us hooked was how Marie Antoinette's husband just won't have sex with her!! My husband would normally dismiss these types of movies as chick flicks, but this plot line kept him intrigued!

I'm not a Kirsten Dunst fan, so she wasn't a big drawcard for me. The costumes and architecture were fabulous and I loved the way they created an air of indulgence and opulence in the palace ... this was somewhat spoiled by random modern background music at odd points in the story.

I loved ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and loved the score, even though it was wrong: it was Vivaldi.  The French favorite Gluck would have been awful in that film.  The little of Gluck was enough in Marie Antoinette.  There had to be a way just to have evocative music written by a modern movie composer and there are a lot of people who could have contributed to the film with good music.

Although the customs would indicate otherwise, this is not really a period piece.

The movie is based on the book by Antonia Fraser. I attempted to read the book, but gave up.

The movie opens in Austria, where Marie is heading off to be married, at the age of fourteen, to the Dauphin of France. Upon her arrival at Versailles, she is married, and the couple are put to bed, where, it is hoped, the marriage is consummated.

Nothing happens. And nothing will happen for some time. In the meantime, we get to see her grow from a young girl, to a woman, mother and queen. We see the extravanges that people so hated her for, and her circle of friends( some questionable, some not) as well as her alleged lover Axel von Fersen.

The costumes are wonderful, and the setting is excellent. You really believe you are watching her life at Versailles. I understand the filmeers were granted access to Versailles for shooting.

1579093,5,B00005JPAS,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.  It just blasts through the pre-conceived ideas we have about historical pieces.  So often, a historical movie provides a gingerly respectful glance at a period of time - complete with costumes, classical music and the proper accents for the time period.  Come on - the music of the period wasn't classical, baroque or whatever - it was the hot new music of the day. The dresses were the absolute cutting-edge of fashion, the time had all the best ""modern"" appliances and devises that were available.  People spoke the natural language of the day.

If you are coming to this movie to learn a completely accurate, fully researched drama about the forces leading up to the French Revolution, get a grip.  What you will learn - more eloquently stated than any history text - is the absolute isolation from everyday events that Marie (and most of the French court) experienced and how they could not even comprehend what everyday life was like for most of their countrymen and women.

So many of the scenes hammer home this idea - without that sense of ""The Filmmaker is Trying To Teach You Something Here - Watch Closely Now"".  Remember the scene where the servants are cleaning up after yet another nite of partying - all the wasted food, all the cakes.  We didn't need a fully dramatized scene of whether or not Marie said ""Let them eat cake"" - we already understand that for her the concept of NOT having bread readily available wasn't even within her realm of understanding.  Why, if there was no bread, just grab a dainty pink pastry from the nearest plate.

The movie begins with Marie being driven in her carriage to a whole new life, and appropriately it ends with the same.  We know about as much about the politics of the day as Marie did.  We don't need to see the final scenes of her life - the tragedy has been set into motion, and now we understand WHY and HOW it all occurred, much more fully than before.

If you are not a history buff and only know Marie Antoinette for the famous ""let them eat cake"" quote attributed (or misattributed) to her than this film paints an elegant and interesting picture of her.  Its fictional but so what, it was made for the masses not Masterpiece Theatre.  Coppola portrays her for what she was, young, insulated, naive, etc.  I like the fact that the film does not judge or vilify her.  It almost begs the question if I were this young queen, surrounded by such luxury would I do the same thing?

1579095,1,B00005JPAS,"Yes, that's right: trash. I watched Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" because I heard it was good and well, it looked interesting, but boy has it been so long since a movie ended and I turned off the screen with such motivation as to stop the pain.

The first half of the film, I found a bit surprising as it contained very little dialogue and moved a tad slowly. The second half of the film must have been put together last minute as it had very little resemblance to the sorted and vague theme that seemd to be constructed at the beginning.

Normally, I'm a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but I found her portrayal of Marie-Antoinette, less than evocative.

I had trouble understanding why this film existed. I read that Coppola wanted to portray Marie-Antoinette in a modern light to make her more real, which I found ironic considering there was very little historical reality in the film. Mostly the film dealt with shopping, glutany, decadence and the struggle to be a young queen. Okay.....this may have been more intriguing if it had some sort of consistent structure or even a little continuity other than the MANY scenes of her shopping. I felt like I was spoon-fed dirty bath water.

The film won an award for Best Costume, which it should have. The costuming was great, but it definately overshadowed any hint of meaning in the film. Between the costuming, modern American accents and make-up, and modern soundtrack, it might as well have been a victorian production of ""Clueless"" with less artistic merit.

I feel the majority of praise this movie received was because the director happens to be one of the few indie-style directors in Holywood.

Not only did the film lack any sort of flow, Marie-Antoinette's daughter was the only one who put forth a French accent, as everyone else had a poor British one.

Coppola said how she wanted to modernize the character to make her more like a teenage girl in a royal life, and that failed attempt proved too much for the rest of the stumbling film to save. Yes the film was blatently modern, and because of that, lost any real connection to the historical figure.

""Evita"" did a far superior job in portraying the rise and fall caused by decadence.

In short, poor acting, poor casting, poor script, weak structure, great costuming, and a total waist of time.",1207267200,6,2310,4.712158808933003
1579096,5,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette  DVD

This movie is about the life of the teenage Austrian girl who married King Louis XVI of France.  I had read about her saying ""Let them eat cake"" for years, when she asked why the peasants were rioting during the French Revolution and was told that they had no bread to eat.  What I didn't really realized until watching this movie was how sheltered and out of touch she was.  She was only 14 when she was packed off to marry Louis, who she had never seen before, was stripped and inspected for blemishes when she reached the hand off point( how embarrassing) and had something like forty people sitting around her bed watching on her wedding night.  ""Nothing happened, apparently.""  Well duh?

Kirsten Dunst gives an excellent performance as the teenage queen, in this movie which starts off set in Austria in 1768.  She spoke German, by the way, not French.

Highly recommended for students of History who want a better insight of this period of European history.  Other items about Marie Antoinette include:

1579097,4,B00005JPAS,"The people who made this film obviously have Schnbrunn Palace in Vienna confused with another palace in Vienna called the Belvedere. Schnbrunn is where the Empress Maria and her daughter, Marie Antoinette, would have lived at the time, not at the Belvedere, but that is the palace you see in the first exterior shot at the beginning of the film where it says ""Austria, 1768"". In the scene selection menu, scene 2 is also incorrectly labelled ""Schnbrunn Palace"" under a still of that shot of the Belvedere. Also, the film shows the coronation of Louis XVI taking place in the same church as his wedding, the court chapel at Versailles, but in reality it took place at the traditional church for the coronations of all French kings, the gothic cathedral of Reims, which has a very different look to it. I'm sure most people who aren't history or architecture buffs will notice these things but it would have made the film more realistic if they hadn't overlooked these details.

I'm also wondering if Judy Davis, as the Comtesse de Noailles (head of the Royal Household), was having some trouble deciding on what kind of accent to use for her character. In some scenes it sounds like she's using a very posh, upper-class British accent, in others it sounds like a French accent and in a few scenes it sounds like something in-between.

I don't think her hairdresser Leonard needed to be portayed as the most swishy, flamboyant queen imaginable, complete with lavender shoes and a pink waistcoat. I'm sure there's a good chance he actually was gay but this kind of characterization is just a ridiculous, cartoonish stereotype.",1206144000,,1623,4.83453237410072
1579098,4,B00005JPAS,"While this movie isn't overly dramatic, it captures an interesting feeling of awkward loneliness that seems very realistic for someone in Marie Antoinette's position. The focus is on Marie's character, and the interpretation of her as warm, young and optimistic, but made somewhat bored and isolated in the restrictive French court, is compelling. Nothing in the plot or dialogue is too obvious or overdone. The loneliness mentioned above is subtle. Marie's situation changes over time as she adjusts, and the movie resists the temptation to make her overly pathetic.

The modern music is a bit too much at times, though. It should have been toned down just a little. The softer rock tracks work well, but the more intense punk songs just seem like a forced attempt to appeal to a young audience, and distract from the movie's real atmosphere.

My only other complaint is the ending. It's rather anticlimactic, especially considering how much more dramatic the historical ending to this story is. It seems like they were purposely shying away from any portrayal of the real violence of the French Revolution, which is a shame since even the tiniest hint of what really happened would have made the ending feel alot more meaningful.

But in general, this was an interesting and sympathetic interpretation of a historical character who doesn't have the best reputation. Quite good!",1205712000,3,1379,5.092920353982301
1579099,5,B00005JPAS,"This movie should cement Sophia Coppola's reputation as one of the best directors working today.  Like her previous movie, ""Lost In Translation"", it has its detractors, but I really can't understand the criticisms.  Each of her movies are less about a typical and cliched ""a"" to ""b"" storyline, but are more character studies in which the subjects are allowed to exist in their own worlds without the audience being guided or manipulated into feeling either good or bad towards the subjects.

In ""Marie Antoinette"", Marie is shown experiencing all aspects of high society France of the 18th century.  She makes a number of choices which arise from situations she is put into and the movie is careful not to make its own commentary as to whether they are good or bad choices.  Because of this, and despite her unflattering historical reputation, I felt some sympathy for Marie Antoinette because the movie made me realize that she was just a person, like any other, and it is not for me to judge her.  Other viewers may have a different impression, and it is completely left up to them to decide on their own.

Of course, any movie that has Marie Antoinette as its subject matter must address the famous ""Let Them Eat Cake"" line and the way it's handled here is near perfect.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but after seeing the movie, try to remember how the director addressed this, and still kept the spirit of the issue alive.

This is another brilliant movie from Sophia Coppola and I, for one, cannot wait to see what she does next!",1205625600,3,1534,4.651851851851852
1579140,3,B00005JPAS,"Forget the historical inaccuracies, rock music, and anachronisms. This movie was a visual feast! It's filled to the hilt with gorgeous costumes, cinematography, and top class art direction. It plays more like a music video, with its minimal dialogue and plot development. This Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a naive, teen queen, isolated from the real world, and trapped in a court of excesses. Kirsten Dunst (along with supporting cast) truly delivers. It's too bad there wasn't more meat to this movie. The lack of a real story made the last half hour drag a bit as you can only stomach just so much eye-candy before getting sick of it.",1205366400,,640,4.827272727272727
1579141,4,B00005JPAS,"When a friend told me that this movie barely touched on the French Revolution and did not even show Marie Antoinette's imprisonment and execution at the guillotine, I was hesitant and almost reconsidered watching it at all. How could any biograhpy worth its salt omit the most critical period of her life, the period that marked her thereafter as a standout figure in history? I couldn't imagine it. Nevertheless, I decided to hold my breath and give it a chance.

I'm very glad I did! My doubts disappeared as I saw how beautifully-done and open-minded this movies is. It's true, it only depicts the decadent years of Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles, but that is just the point. It's not meant to be a lofty biopic, but rather a visual representation of one phase of her life. Sofia Coppola aimed to show, not tell. The costumes, which are lush and gorgeous, and the set, which is the breathtaking palace of Versailles itself, dominate, favored over heavy dialogue or great political discussions which you might find in other period dramas. Many people have dismissed the movie because of this, but on the other hand, if you want all the historical detail, then you could read the plethora of informative books out there about Marie Antoinette. But this is a film, a completely different form of expression. The main purpose of a visual representation should be to show the subject in an intriguing way, through camera angles and set designs and expressions from the actors that evoke emotion, rather than relying only on words. This movie does that. So, I think the rich style and visual emphasis of this film is very refreshing. If there had never been a movie or biography made of Marie Antoinette, then the lack of historical detail would have still been frustrating. But the thing is, there has. Coppola decided to take a different direction and put a new, creative spin on it. You have to give her credit for that.

Part of her style in this movie is based on modern influences. The choice of music is great. I love the concept of mixing modern music with period pieces, because it can enhance the vibrancy and energy, along with helping modern audiences feel a stronger connection to the era. It works quite well in this movie, just like it did in Knight's Tale. It doesn't reduce the credibility, and I think that is because music is transcendent, and different types of music can leap across the generations and still apply to old and new alike, in a quirky way. The accents of the actors, too, are modern and varied with no attempt of change. This aspect actually aggravated me at first, but I admit that it's pretty unrealistic to expect the largely non-francophone cast to don perfect french accents. And that wouldn't be right, either. And in any case, it still adds to the brazen portrayal of Marie Antoinette, hearing Kirsten Dunst with her American accent as is, although I can see how it might be offensive to many viewers, and strain their credulity. For me, it was alright.

Above all, though, what really rings true for this movie is the echo of the Rococo era, which had all of the Baroque ornamentation but was curiously unique with its glowing air of pastels, frivolity and lightness. The depiction of the court of Versailles, Marie Antoinette's world, is just that. By capturing a specific time frame in her life, and focusing on the one setting of Versailles, an intimate tone is established and this movie feels like one vast portrait. It creates a strong sentiment of naive carelessness as we are locked in her charmed perception. I strongly believe that if Sofia Coppola had continued to take us through the dark days of Marie Antoinette's life, it would have clashed badly with this innocent tone. To me, to actually see the execution after the light portrayal of Versailles would have felt tactless and too jarring. Simply showing her leaving Versailles in her carriage, gazing out the window, resonated much more deeply, and kindly. It's only fitting. She was flippant and careless at Versailles, but she was also trapped in many ways, and didn't deserve her fate. As we watch, we know where she is headed (no pun intended), and seeing her in that last calm before the storm arouses a kind of pity for her clueless behavior in the past, along with a bittersweet sadness for the realization that she is on the edge of disgrace and ruin, but allowed one last graceful moment.",1203984000,3,4411,4.748370273794003

1579143,4,B00005JPAS,"I got into this movie half way through on TV and literally hated it the first time I saw it. But it called me back and now I've watched it at least half a dozen times. This was really an ambitious movie with the sets and costumes and for that director Sophia Coppola did a fantastic job.

The sets, actor extras, costumes all done to perfection. If you're into horses you'll have a full plate with the big black magnificent Friesians pulling the royal carriages to the gorgeous white Lippizans and the big grey Lusitano stallion that Louis 16 rides on hunts. Coppola got her details down to what kind of horses that were used in those days.

The one weak point (VERY weak) is Kirsten Dunst. She pretty much sleep walked through this movie. Even the ""Let them eat cake"" line, pretty much on the top 10 most famous quotes in history was uttered with such nothingness I could't believe it.  It was as if she was just saying the line; no emotion tied to it whatsoever. You CAN be a shallow twit interested only in parties and spending the country broke, but still there's a personality in that person. And there was definitely more person inside Antoinette than Dunst could develop, flesh and blood. Dunst portrayed her about as thick and fleshy as onion skin paper.

Everyone around Dunst was acting their little brains out. Especially Judy Davis who pretty much devoured the scenery with her over-acting. One would expect that huge red slash of a mouth to be full of wallpaper and curtains! I don't know if Dunst was following directions to be completly passive and shallow, or the fact that she just plain can't ACT! And I agree Rip Torn is basically a cliche horny old goat anymore. I did love the casting of Madam DuBarry. I can see why the guys loved her. She had spunk and spirit. She stole the movie. I got so interested in her, I'm looking for biographies on her. Jason Schwartzman basically looked too darkly Jewish to play a part where all the participants looked very Nordic. He was very good at portraying Louis 16 as a mentally arrested adolescent/man.

Call me morbid but I wish they had had the budget to go all the way to the guillotine. Not sure Dunst could pull off acting like she was about to die. Hm...maybe that's why the movie quit where it did.",1203638400,,2265,4.5012165450121655
1579144,4,B00005JPAS,"Director Sofia Coppola's father, Francis Ford Coppola, after the harrowing experience of directing ""Apocalypse Now"", made some interesting films that were both diverse and interesting with varying degrees of success.  I mention this because Sofia's career path is following a similar trajectory as her father's.  With this film and ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation""(which I didn't get) Sofia is not yet on equal footing as her father but she has established herself as a talent to be reckoned with.  ""Marie Antoinette"" is not a great film but most certainly it's an interesting one.  The intent here is to portray the notorious Queen of France in a sympathetic light.  The film follows her from the time she was a callow teenager born of Austrian nobility forced into a loveless marriage of convenience to the Dauphin of France till her inevitable fate with the guillotine.  Kirsten Dunst, always a formidable actress, probably gives her best performance ever in portraying the evolution of her character.  Jason Schwartzmann, in what could have been a totally unsympathetic role, engenders some empathy for Louis.  The great Rip Torn gives a lusty turn as the King of France.  The decor is sumptuous and the Oscar winning costumes are breathtaking.  The film's lone glaring debit is the intermittent use of latter day pop music.  Really, Sofia, what place does Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" have in the Eighteenth Century?

1579147,5,B00005JPAS,"Writer/director Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is a true pleasure. Featuring Kirstin Dunst as the infamous Austrian suddenly made Dauphine of France in her early teens, it is a cheeky yet delightfully offbeat retelling of her tumultuous life and times.

Playing like a moving painting, the film contains spectacular costumery that rightfully earned Milena Canonero the Academy Award for Costume Design. Thankfully, it matches style with substance.

Historical dramas are chiefly characterized as dull, stuffy tribulations that provide no means for riveting entertainment, but Coppola wisely sets her standards high without compromising artistic integrity. She has her actors speak without any trace of French accent, and historians have griped about the looseness with which she treats key facts of the time. Had she adhered so tightly to those details, however, ""Marie Antoinette"" would not only be less relatable for the modern movie fan, it would be less of a pleasure - certainly inappropriate for a film depicting the life of one of history's most notorious hedonists.

Dunst clearly knows she is privileged to score the title role, and does not take one second of her screen time for granted. Youthful and unassuming early on the film, she is a thoroughly convincing teenager. With talented actors like Jason Schwartzman and Judy Davis to play off of, she makes the displacement and isolation Antoinette faced come alive on screen.

A pawn to soothe the rift between Austria and France, she is handed over to be the wife of Louis XVI , played by Schwartzman, so that an heir to the French throne may be produced. She is greeted with mixed emotions, and when her husband proves ill-equipped to due his part to produce the heir, she incurs all the blame for not being ""willing and sweet"" toward him - after all, for a woman, what is there but making babies? She also shocks all the elite by snubbing Madame du Barry, played perfectly by Asia Argento, mistress of King Louis XV, also played to great effect by none other than Rip Torn.

Few friends prove genuine to Antoinette, but those that do indulge in luxuries along with her - closetfuls of designer shoes and endless trays of champagne, strawberries and cream puffs, namely. She may be a big spender, but Coppola, who bases her film on ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey,"" a recent biography by Lady Antonia Fraser, underplays this in favor of humanizing the young sprite who, after all, found herself in a most unusual situation at an extremely young age. It should be noted that, while the film does chronicle Antoinette's downfall, it does not feature her execution, which is not necessary for Coppola's vision to be accomplished.

Rip Torn's small but affecting role as Louis XV is good enough to have won him the Oscar he has yet to achieve, and Molly Shannon is surprisingly well cast as busybody Aunt Victoire. Rose Byrne is also fantastic as Antoinette's fun-loving friend Duchess de Polignac, foreshadowing a great film career yet to be.

The film sports an awesome soundtrack of modern sounds by bands like Gang of Four and The Strokes that provide context for the many themes of Antoinette's life.",1200873600,4,3169,4.990530303030303

And that's where my original review ended--short & sweet--but the watchers at Amazon wouldn't accept it on the grounds that it lacked substance--just like this film. So I thought I'd comment on the real woman this movie is supposed to be about.

The interesting thing about Marie Antoinette is that she was a rather ordinary woman of her class who, through motherhood & unbelievably bad luck (like a revolution), nonetheless matured as an individual & discovered the courage to face the terrors life had in store for her. In many ways her story parallels that of Princess Diana. The royal marriage that was supposed to be something out of a fairy tale, turns out to be more a deadly nightmare instead. Both had husbands who were really not interested in them; Diana's because of adultery, and Marie's due to her husband's physical impediment. They both fiercely loved their children--and, of course, both died tragically.

Marie Antoinette also pre-shadowed Diana's hounding by the paparazzi. She was the first monarch to fall victim to the (printing) press. The hated Austrian Queen of France was subject to an unrelenting & savgage attack in slanderous articles, broadsides & vicious cartoons. All the problems in France at that time were said to be instigated by her. The early extravagance of her youth brought her the unfavorable epitah ""Madame Deficit."" When she became a mother she began to understand how foolish she had been & curbed & even stopped frivolous behavior--but too late, the title stuck. She was accused of every crime & sin in the book. We won't go into that, but the point is that there was such more to the real story of this ill-fated woman.

An early Hollywood B&W film ""Marie Antoinette"" even with all its historic inaccuracies & romanticisms hit truer to the mark than Coppola's nonsense. Actress Norma Shearer is very good in the role, ranging from fifteen to thirty-seven. Of course she never really appears to physically age in the film until the final scenes (that would have been a box office no-no), but she conveyed the age progression through her art. In one scene a timeless moment of acting brilliance is captured in the picture. It is the scene following the King's execution. Marie Antoinette, who by this time had developed a solid marriage & deep friendship with Louis, is alone in a dingy cell with her son & daughter. The revolutionists barge in with an order to permanently remove the boy from his mother's care. As they go to take him, Norma Shearer lunges at them screaming, almost snarling, ""You're not going to take my son!""

The authenticity of the performance, in that one moment, is a revelation of real acting talent.

She, as Austrian royalty, at 15 is expected to marry then-Prince Louis XIV, so that both the Austrians and French could be allies, thus preventing any kind of war between them during the French revolution.  While Dunst makes the most of her limited range of emotion, she fails to give the subject matter any real depth.  Jason Schwartzmann, as Louis, shows absolutely no real emotion whatsoever.  I understand that they were very young.  I also understand that they had a huge weight of responsibility placed on their shoulders very young.  I blame Coppola for not making the most of some talent.  There was no energy, no passion.  I didn't believe Dunst as doting mother, either.  She seemed more like a big sister to the children (who outpaced their elders in the acting arena).  While the movie did show the ""real"" Antoinette-Louis relationship, and her thoughts for the starving peasants, it failed miserably to keep me interested in what must be a very colorful historical character.

So, I released a burdensome sigh when I dropped this DVD in the player ... then, I stared at the ""two hours and two minutes"" stamp with an expression of pain. Within minutes, I was completely riveted ...

Coppola's work is masterful. The mise en scne is breathtaking. Coppola's design-training (always evident in her work) is in full bloom: each frame is its own work of art. (And, until now, I have never seen the garishness of Versailles as beautiful). I was charmed by the artist's attention to the most minute detail. As if taking a cue from her cinematographer for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Virgin-Suicides/dp/B00003CXH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Virgin Suicides</a>&nbsp;(Edward Lachman), Coppola uses pale pinks and blues to emphasize Marie Antoinette's innocence (although Dunst was in her twenties, remember that Marie Antoinette was a mere fourteen years-old when sent to France). After an affair with Count Fersen, the queen's  infidelity is emphasized by a scarlet belt (very clever). The lushness of the film cannot be conveyed with words ...

The acting is sublime. While I have never cared for the roles into which Dunst is usually thrust (save&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interview-with-the-Vampire/dp/B00004RFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interview with the Vampire</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Virgin-Suicides/dp/B00003CXH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Virgin Suicides</a>), this role is pure perfection. Dunst brings warmth and vulnerability to a much maligned historical figure. Moreover, Schwartzman is both compelling and amusing in his role as Louis XVI ... he, too, is wildly sympathetic as a ""child-king"" (only twenty years-old) ... ""God help us. We are too young to reign.""

Coppola never intended to create a work faithful to history. Why should she? Anyone can flip to The History Channel or PBS to see that. Instead,  Coppola grants us the portrait of a frightened child ... with the hopes of France and Austria pinned to her frilly dress ... trying to navigate a tangle of tradition ... very much alone.

Two hours and two minutes passed in a flash of decadence and heartbreak. After viewing Coppola's junior project, I can hardly await her next film. This is a phenomenal effort and a phenomenal success. Thank you Coppola for such a beautiful film!

1579270,5,B00005JPAS,"I was expecting the worst, especially after all the bad reviews. To my astonishment, I loved this film! Enough has already been said about the visual delights, but it is the delicate, softly woven tapestry of a story beneath that makes this movie a real gem. The music, however out of sync with the period, strangely worked, setting the appropriate mood. And make no mistake this film is all about mood. It is less a biography than a sensory exploration; a story told through the senses.
  One percieves the mood and atmosphere of Antoinette's world, and the slow pace of the film relfects this. It was a time and place where nothing is rushed, where it is all about grace, beauty, the pursuit of the senses. The message is there for anyone to see: Marie Antoinette was a victim of circumstance, but her life was not all about tragedy. She is not the monster of legend, nor is she particularly extraordinary. She is portrayed here as a refreshingly normal young woman, who reacts in much the same way anyone would in her situation.
  The principle criticism I've read about Sofia Copula's vision, is that she leaves out the hungry peasants, the crazed revolutionaries, and the Queen's date with the guillotine. Having watched this movie several times, it makes perfect sense.
  The majority of Antoinette's life was spent at Versailles, behind gilded gates, and far removed from the ugly side of France. The viewer is not exposed to these unpleasant aspects because the Queen herself was not exposed to them, remaining blissfully ingnorant in her sheltered dream-world (rather like suburbanites of present day, removed from the sight of inner-city squalor). Hence, much of the film takes on a dream-like quality, and ends appropriately when the real world comes crashing through those golden gates. The causes of the revolution are left unexplained because Antoinette herself did not understand them (how could she?). Her subsequent imprisionment and beheading are not covered for the same reason: to Antoinette the woman, her life was of far more significance than her death.
  If there is any flaw in this work of art, it is that Ms. Copula seriously over-estimated the attention span and intellect of her audience. But I am very grateful for it.
  A final note: I too saw the pink sneaker shot, and agree with other reviewers that it was unnecessary and gratuitous. The one black mark on an otherwise great film.",1196467200,5,2415,4.897058823529412

I finally did something right IMO; I disregarded all of the controversial press this film received,read Antonia Fraser's book from which director Sofia Coppola drew her inspiration,bought the DVD,watched it....and WAS ASTOUNDED!!!THIS IS NOT ANOTHER DOCUDRAMA, so be advised!

This film is so eye-catching and refreshingly unique in its approach to the much documented and oft misunderstood Marie Antoinette ( an endearing and perfectly innocent Kirsten Dunst),the Austrian Princess who,at the young age of 14 is married out to Prince Louis 16th to secure an alliance between Austria and France. Coppola,using Fraser's novel,recreates an image of carefree decadence and careless youth in bold colors and daring costumes (Oscar winner Milena Canonero-""Chariots of Fire"") as Antoinette flitters around the real Versailles Palace learning to adjust to French Court life,a ridiculously shy ""husband"" (Jason Schwartzman?-THIS CASTING  WORKS!!!!), and the ridicule and gossip that cuts like a knife from the courtiers. This film is bathed in candy colors and fresh pastels that Coppola uses to convey a sense of 21st century sensibility to an 18th story. Coppola uses gorgeous Baroque French music and opera to give us a feel for the times, but is unabashedly bold to use heavy metal rock tunes in order to bring her unique and fresh perspective on a Queen whose youth and inexperience at life and lack of knowledge concerning ""her adopted people"" causes her most ruinous downfall. Coppola's view towards Antoinette,like Fraser's book, is sympathetic towards their subject. This is good,because Marie Antoinette was much skewered by the Press and much false propaganda caused much distrust among the French. Fraser,s book and Coppola's film endeavour to possibly correct some,not all, of the misconceptions surrounding the Royal Couple.
Other films that add light on Marie Antoinette and Court Life would be THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE,PBS' MARIE ANTOINETTE,MARIE ANTOINETTE:QUEEN OF VERSAILLES,SADE,RIDICULE,LADY AND THE DUKE,THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL (any version) and somewhat AMADEUS.
I challenge viewers to see this film with an open eye and mind. It is revelatory while being incredibly innovative,eye-dazzling and downright entertaining.
One of the smartest films I ever waited to see. DVD extras contain a great look at Coppola and her vision for this work.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1192406400,3,2409,5.561307901907357
1579275,3,B00005JPAS,"I enjoyed ""Marie Antoinette"" a lot more than I thought I would. The film begins with Marie (Kirsten Dunst), the Austrian Archduchess, setting off to France to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). Unfortunately, Marie's new husband has little interest in her or in the act of consummating their marriage, so the future queen finds herself in limbo for quite some time, as it is uncertain whether she will produce an heir to the throne and thus survive at court. Eventually Louis-Auguste comes around, and Marie gives birth to a daughter, and later a son. In the meantime, Marie becomes known as the Queen of Excesses, spending copious amounts of money on clothing and jewels instead of bothering to become acquainted with the issues of relevance to the French people. Marie enjoys parties, sweets, and even an illicit affair, but the fun comes crashing down when the monarchy falls out of favor with the citizens of France, who angrily storm the castle in an attempt on Marie's life. Eventually the royal family is forced to flee their home and go into hiding.

Obviously, the best thing about this movie is the way it looks on screen. Watching ""Marie Antoinette"" is like stepping into a high-end bakery and admiring a bunch of scrumptious, frilly wedding cakes. Everything about the film is absolutely beautiful: the costumes, the shoes, the palaces, the desserts. However, the dialogue in the first half of the movie is very choppy and sparse, so the only thing for the audience to do is admire all the visual beauty. After a while the script does manage to turn itself around, and I think the second half of the movie is much better in terms of storyline and character development. ""Marie Antoinette"" has a fabulous soundtrack that consists of mostly punk music, which is a lot of fun. Also, the cast is excellent. I was impressed with all the performances, especially Dunst's. She portrays Marie as a naive, frivolous, but not entirely unsympathetic person. I thought she did a really good job.

I was surprised that the film ended so abruptly and did not take us to the end of Marie's life. I think the story could have wrapped up a lot better than it did. All in all, though, ""Marie Antoinette"" isn't great, but it's very good.",1191628800,43,2236,4.790155440414508

Sure, it was cool to see the lavish palace of Versailles, and the obnoxiously opulant clothing and food that the nobility of France enjoyed. However, I was let down by the fact that the movie had NO POINT to it! It was like going to a dumb party full of shallow Hollywooders, and then all of a sudden the party is over and the credits start rolling!

This absurd film did not even show the true side of 18th century France: destitute, starving, Ethiopian-looking peasants with little to hope for, since their greedy noble caretakers like Marie Antoinette were taxing them to death. While Antoinette and her ilk were living ritzy lifestyles, the REAL PEOPLE of France were opening the door to revolution, to freedom--well, freedom from the old monarchy, anyway.

Today, every 14th of July is celebrated as France's independence day, when the common people raided the Bastille. This sorry movie never even showed a crowd of peasants storming the famous fortress. NOTHING HAPPENED!

But why should I have gotten my hopes up? I should have realized why this film gave a sympathetic portrait of the tramp Antoinette, and not the 98% of the French people who were seeking freedom from tyranny she symbolized. It is becasue Marie Antoinette symbolizes today's shallow nobility: Hollywooders! Based on their movies like this one, their whole lives are absorbed by nothing but fashion, elegant food, clothes, and sex.

The only suspense in the movie is waiting to see if Marie will get pregnant or not. Plus modern pop music (Adam Ant?!) is interjected into the movie at odd times, as if the director is desperately trying to liven up the movie.

1579356,2,B00005JPAS,"In Anerica there has always been an almost unhealthy fascination with Marie Antionette.

I suspect this is mostly inherited from the British historians and their fascination with the royal family and the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Not to mention the British historical fiction writers and the hundreds of trashy historical romances written about Marie Antoinettte.

Every story deserves to be told, but often some stories are told at the expense of others. For example in America every Joe Shmoe knows who Marie Antoinette is, but only history geeks know who Robspierre, Marat, or Danton are. Is this a good sign for a democratic country. Not that Robspierre, Marat, or Danton were saints, but then that's really the whole point. Their lives could offer a valuable study of the possible problems inherit in democratic revolutions or republican societies. Wouldn't it be better to focus attention on these stories instead (as the French themselves do when they write novels about the revolution)?

But, I guess Hollywood decided just what the public needed was another sappy story about Marie Antionette, and so we have this movie.

On the historical side, I thought it was pretty accurate. I know this movie has been slammed for its lack of historical accuracy, but as far as I can tell that's mostly just because of the rock music and anachronistic props.

Granted I'm no expert, but for example I remember reading about how Marie Antionette used to loose her patience with the long dressing ceremonies in the morning when she would be shivering in the cold as her courtiers would debate proper protocal. And that is faithfully reproduced in this movie.

Being the historical geek I am, I always rush to the internet after watching a movie like this to check out how much of it is true. And as far as I could tell, it checked out pretty well. Some debatable court rumors and gossip were portrayed as fact, but that is always the prerogative of historical fiction.

So adding in the Internet time, I'd consider I got a pretty good history lesson out of this movie. I learned a bit about life at the French Royal court, and some of the rivarlies and gossip of the time.

However since this film intentionally stays clear of politics and focuses only on court life, the big question is: how much do I really care about the gossip of Versailles? I'd say the director's assumption that I would stay interested for 2 hours is pushing it a little. The film ends just as Louis and Marie are forcibly escorted to Paris, but in fact they lived for several years afterwords and from a historians perspective, the film ends just as Marie's life is beginning to get interesting.

Of course Marie Antionette's lavish spending was one of the causes of the Revolution, and this is hinted at in the movie, but only touched on briefly. I heard one historian say Marie Antionette was the Imelda Marcos of her time, and I think there's a lot of truth in it, but the distinction between Marie's spending and the people's misery could have come through a lot clearer.

What is left then? A portrait of a woman isolated and made miserable admist all her privalage. It is impossible not to feel a little sorry for Marie Antionette as an Austrian princess who was married off for political reasons and had to adjust to all the absurdity of Versailles. But on the scale of human suffering, it doesn't really stack up to a lot of the other stories.",1187395200,5,3430,4.7207357859531776

Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone.

1579359,5,B00005JPAS,"As she did with the two competing young American women in contemporary Tokyo (Anna Faris and Scarlet Johansson), omce again Sofia Coppola has written and directed a story, based on her own life, of an unsatisfied young bride hungry for attention who must contrast her own stifled dreams with the dramatically sensuous life of a rival.  In this case Coppola casts Asia Argento as the legendary Madama Du Barry, the favorite of the king.  Argento, the daughter of Italian horrormeister Dario Argento, is but one of several actors cast here because they, like Coppola herself, are ""Hollywood royalty"" and thus lend the picture an extra dimension by their mere presence in the cast list--Danny Huston, the son of the late John Huston, plays the Emperor of Austria here, in a few amusing scenes.

It is said that just as she pursued Bill Murray for years, hounding him into taking the lead role in LOST IN TRANSLATION, Coppola used all her wiles, but unsuccessfully, hoping to lure French film icon Alain Delon into playing Louis XV, the man who kept Madame Du Barry constantly on hand no matter how much scandal it created in court.  Alas, Rip Torn took the part and plays it exactly as if he thought he was still filming THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.  He's great and all, but a little out of place, whereas he should have been the still, ominous center of the film, the master of everything he controlled.

It was whispered that Du Barry had been arrested 14 times on charges ranging from prostitution to witchcraft by the time she was presented at court in 1769, about a year before the action of Coppola's film takes place.  What a spectacle Asia makes of herself--licking Torn's face, feeding him wine and bits of food, letting him slobber up and down her generous cleavage.  ""Don't hold back,"" Coppola must have told her.  ""Remember, you're a magnificent wench!""  To ensure she gave the performance Coppola wanted, the director arranged for Asia Argento to watch a special screening, at the Cinematheque Francaise, of King Vidor's DUEL IN THE SUN, in which Jennifer Jones rips up the screen with passion as the ""half-breed"" Pearl Chavez.  Elderly theatergoers with long memories might recall that Ethel Merman, of all people, also essayed the part of Madame Du Barry, but Merman was refined as Gwyneth Paltrow compared to the finger licking, throw your head back and laugh evilly je je sais quoi of Asia Argento.

When Marie mopes around the Petit Trianon thinking about her lover, it was similar to Charlotte moping around her Tokyo hotel room waiting for her boyfriend. Coppola is particularly good at chronicling a a kind of feminine loneliness and malaise. We sympathize with Charlotte and Marie even though it's easy to feel impatient with their lack of introspection and seemingly empty lives. By minimizing the political context Marie lived in (all we hear the Revolution is about is people wanting bread) and fore-grounding Marie's sort-of-Rousseauian innocence, she becomes, like Charlotte, an amiable but essentially lonely outsider.",1185494400,,965,5.655172413793103

1579405,2,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006) is an embarrassing disaster - glamorous, colorful, shot inside and outside of French Versailles in its most lavish but disaster nevertheless. I don't know for whom the movie was made - perhaps, for Ms. Coppolla herself to add another chapter to her dreamy quiet slow moving films about bored and confused young girls. Her previous work, ""Lost in Translation"" was quite good even if not a timeless masterpiece as some critics and viewers tend to believe. Her latest film about a girl who happened to be born in 1755, a daughter and sister to the Austrian Emperors, the future wife and mother to French Kings, simply does not work. The film starts when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI. She arrives to the most fashionable, glamorous, and corrupted European court where she would remain ""the foreigner"", ""The Austrian"". The film depicts Marie Antoinette's life up until 1789 when the Great French Revolution starts with the storming of Bastille, the infamous Paris prison on July 14, 1789, and the King and Queen leave Versailles forever to meet their destiny. The film completely omits the final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life and never mentions the circumstances of her last five years. These five years were filled with the purest tragedy: death of her husband who was tried for treason, found guilty and executed on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was brought to trial where she was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, ""the Widow Capet"" or simply ""Antoinette Capet"" replied with the genuine royal dignity, ""If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother...""

When I visited Paris several years ago, I went to see The Conciergerie Prison where Marie Antoinette was kept before her death and from where she was taken on the morning of October 16, 1793, ""forced into a tumbrel and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la Rvolution where the guillotine stood."" Spending short time in the Antoinette's prison cell let me learn about her tragic final days that Sofia Coppola chose not to include in her movie. I respect her decision to tell the story of the ill-fated last Queen of France as a bored and frustrated teenage girl with a sweet smile and charming dimples, whose equally young, shy and totally inexperienced husband was more interested in the history of locks and keys than in making love and children to her but by making Marie-Antoinette the central figure of the film and never taking her camera outside the palace, Coppolla limited her movie to the typical ""chick flick"" that happened to take place in Versailles.

Marie-Antoinette as played by Kurstin Dunst is not very interesting person; she leads a boring life within the strict etiquette's rules of the Royal Palace, and all she wants - to have some fun. It is OK to make a movie about boring life of boring and bored insignificant people but it is not OK to never mention what actually was going on outside the palace where the real life was happening and the revolution was brewing way before Coppola chose to mention the shortage of bread for the commoners and storming of Bastille. The second half of the 18th Century was enormously interesting and eventful time in the history of France, Europe, and the World. It was the time when Mozart wrote his music, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais had finished his three Figaro plays, and the most brilliant one, ""The Marriage of Figaro"" was banned by the King for its irreverent attitude towards the aristocracy from being performed. Outside the Palace's walls, very intelligent, free thinking angry young men from ""Third Estate"" (the ""Commons""), grew up, received good education, and became lawyers, physicians, journalists, and scientists. Influenced by philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of Libert, Egalit, Fraternit that they embraced in The Jacobin Club in Paris, they later would become leaders of the French Revolution that would destroy the old regime of the absolute monarchy but eventually turn into the Reign of Terror in which the passionate revolutionaries would perish along with the aristocrats. Among them, Mirabeau - a great orator and able statesman; Danton, a figure larger than life; Robespierre, known as ""incorruptible"", Jean Paul Marat, scientist and revolutionary. None of them have been ever mentioned in the movie. Even the notorious Affair of the diamond necklace that was historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's bitter disappointment with the monarchy and contributed to the growing hatred toward the Queen who had been nicknamed, ""Madam Deficit"", did not deserve a single remark in the movie about Marie Antoinette.

I've read some articles that defend the film by saying that it is not a historic movie but ""the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence"". These articles keep pointing to the visual beauty, production design, Oscar winning costumes, and nice cinematography. They are indeed lovely and the movie is an eye candy but Marie Antoinette as she was presented in the Sophia Coppola's movie can't herself hold this viewer's interest no matter how many pretty dresses with the elegant matching shoes she has changed and how many tiny delightful pastries she has eaten, and I am a huge fan of low cut dresses and those delicious pastries, believe me.

1579441,3,B00005JPAS,"As the movie opens, a marriage has been arranged for 14-year old Maria Antonia (Kirsten Dunst) of Austria and Louis, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  She is immediately packed off to the court of Versailles where she is the object of suspicion as a foreigner, and her husband is unable or unwilling to consummate their marriage.  Plucky Marie Antoinette manages to quickly adjust to her lavish and pampered lifestyle by indulging in power-shopping and taking a lover.  At the age of 19, she is Queen of France, a mother, and totally unaware of the desperate conditions of the poor in Paris.

From the first punk rock tune during the opening credits, I knew this was not going to be a typical historical drama.  Indeed, the soundtrack mixes rock songs with a few classical pieces, creating a quirky, surreal atmosphere.  If you liked the odd mix of a period story with modern music in the movie ""Moulin Rouge,"" you'll like this one.

On the plus side, it's easy to feel immersed in court life, where all the nobility had to do all day was dress in stunningly gorgeous outfits, gossip about everyone, and see and be seen.  The costumes are incredibly opulent and much of the filming was done in and around Versailles, so this is a visual feast, to say the least.  I did find it annoying that no mention is ever made of dates and the passage of time (19 years) is vague since the actors don't seem to age.  Dunst is horribly miscast as Marie Antoinette.  She looks and sounds like a mid-west Girl Scout, using words like, ""yeah"" and ""gonna,"" and generally looking silly amid the sophisticated surroundings.  I give it five stars for the photography and one star for Dunst and the soundtrack, for a score of 3 ***.",1183680000,,1721,4.625
1579442,4,B00005JPAS,"It's not perfect, but it's a much better piece of cinema than its critics would have you believe.  In fact, what is created here is a deliciously personal movie about a historical figure - made not as an epic, but as an intimate and `in-the-moment' portrayal of a teenager in over her head.
It's the first key to liking this movie - it is a teen-movie.  Not for them but about one.  such, all we are seeing is how Marie Antoinette must have seen her life.  A young teenager put into a political arranged marriage as the Dauphine of France, she has to leave all behind and finds herself in an intolerable situation (an unconsummated marriage - for 7 years!) with no frame of reference.  That's the second key to liking it - it is about her removal from a sense of reality - Versaille is geographically, politically, socially and economically isolated from the reality of France, until the tragic end.  (a tragic end which the movie stops just before, incidentally).
This lack of a reality touchstone sends the teenager into spirals of excess - and yet Kirsten Dunst finds new depths in portraying her as indulgent, and yet sincere.  Petulant yet patient and revelling in luxury, yet loyal regardless of cost.  The movie itself has been criticised for having discordant elements - modern (and 80's) music, hand held camera movements, brighter than bright colours - and yet this is highly effective at making this story real, and not a historical document - exactly what Sofia Coppola was trying to achieve.  One scene which exemplifies this, is the masked ball - an occasion which should in most period movies would be starchy and elegant - but here is almost like a night club or a rave with pounding soundtrack - and this is precisely the excitement and impression this occasion would have engendered in a spoilt and privileged teenager.
Finally, the other ingredients (an apt turn of phrase since everything looks like candy) that complete the feel of the movie - the set design and the music.  The film was given complete access to Versaille, which makes the location vivid and real - and yet in set design the filmmakers have made these places not a museum, but a real vibrant place home to many.  And of course all the wonderful bright and pastel shades made so that `everything looks like cake' are terrific to watch.  And then the music - apart from the occasional pop song as mentioned before, the music actually evokes various moods - from the lyrical simplicity of rural France, to melancholy similar in tone to the soundtrack of Lost in Translation, through to modern beats - it's a brilliant and imaginative score.
Top marks to Coppola - I preferred this even to Lost in Translation.  It certainly won't be to everyones taste and best rented than bought - but it is a uniquely personal movie deserving a viewing so you can make up your own mind.",1183334400,6,2856,4.676646706586826
1579443,3,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette,"" starring Kirsten Dunst, is a big old piece of cheesecake . . . it looks and tastes delicious, but eating of it too heartily will only make you sleepy and obese.  There is little or nothing of resonance in ""MA,"" beyond some spectacular costume and set design.

""MA"" begins with our ""heroine"" as an innocent Austrian teenager, whisked away by geopolitics into a marriage with the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  And so begins Ms. Coppola's ""poor little rich girl"" story, where she tries valiantly to redeem Ms. Antoinette and make her an object of sympathy and admiration.  Ultimately, that's a dog that just won't hunt.

We see early scenes where the spoiled rich nobility - empty suits and dresses all - smirk behind their gloves at the uncouth Austrian princess while also imposing the most ridiculous set of rules and protocols upon her.  Judy Davis exemplifies the silliness of the French court as she sternly instructs Marie to leave her beloved dog at the Austrian border - you can have as many French dogs as you like, my dear!  All these scenes pummel us into acknowledging Marie as a sympathetic figure, and yet so far she is nothing more than an undefined teenager.

But soon, Marie adopts the spoiled ways of her French counterparts - she shops endlessly, takes a lover (that seems to be little more than an infatuation than a soulmate), and ignores the plight of her subjects.  The fact that Marie lives in the uber-opulence of Versailles (gorgeously shot, as if it could be filmed any other way) undermines any attempt to shore up Marie's sympathetic side.  In one shocking scene, Marie is confronted with the troubles of her people - there is a horrible bread shortage.  Her response?  She makes the less-than-magnificent concession, ""Tell the jeweler to stop buying diamonds.""  Truly, a woman of the people.

Much has been made of the anachronistic '80s soundtrack, and I'll add my own quibble.  The movie seems to go about it half-way.  Much of the movie comes straight out of Merchant-Ivory, with baroque music and a period feel, but occasionally a Cure tune or other '80s punk band drops in.  Coppola could have gone all-out post-modern, like Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet,"" but this half-measure in unsatisfying.

There are positives in this movie, but it is hard to come down on that side of the scale where the overarching purpose of the film - to redeem one of Europe's most glamorous villains - rings so false.  It is also unsettling that Schwartzman is given so little to do - his recent turn in ""Shopgirl"" shows that ""Rushmore"" was no fluke.  Dunst is beautiful, but her performance does not even match the intensity Madonna brought to Eva Peron in ""Evita.""

And to top it off, after ""Lost in Translation,"" I had exceedingly high expectations for Coppola's follow-up effort.  Perhaps unfairly high, but regardless, they were not met.

Check out this movie if you are a huge fan of costume and set design, but other than that, it's worth a rental, nothing more.",1183334400,2,3030,4.818181818181818

As the days pass after seeing this movie, I find myself thinking of it and the infamous Marie. As I read the reviews, I find I like the movie even more. I like movies that get people riled up.

I saw this knowing very little about Marie Antoinette and I think that made the experience that much more enjoyable. Why do people watch a movie that's obviously not a typical ""historical film"" and then expect it to be utterly historically accurate? Come on, look at the cover- you should know what you're in for. If you get to watch the making of on this DVD, it helps you understand where Sofia was going and I think she did a marvelous job. She made it her own. The music (fantastic!), the costumes (gorgeous), and the sets are enough to keep your eyes fixed upon the screen.
My only complaint would be the choice of Molly Shannon. She looked entirely out of place. It was like, ""Oh, look it's Molly Shannon playing dress-up.""
 This is more of an interpretation of the life of Marie Antoinette. Coppola's vision was to get people to think about why Marie spiraled out of control and chose decadence. As to whether you think it's right or wrong, that's the fun of a film like this. It sparks discussion. The fact that it has made so many people upset should be an indication that Coppola has succeeded. I found it fascinating and now want to know more about this famous Queen.

1579448,5,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola's third film `Marie Antoinette' just may be her finest cinematic accomplishment.  It's enriched with life, character and charm and it still manages to layer itself with the subtle illusion of grief and misery that surrounded this tragic story.  Sophia, along with a brilliant cast, was able to take a story plucked fresh from the history books and make it relatable and entertaining, refreshing amidst the modern era of the biopic.  Coppola's film here mainly focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and through Kirsten Dunst's brilliant performance the audience is brought to the soul of this woman and the soul of her conflict.  She as young, she was nave but most of all she was lost in a world far above her head, one trust upon her, one that embraced her and then turned on her when they needed a scapegoat.

Dunst is riveting in the title role, and the film is really a showcase for her talent.  The film starts off with Marie just a young teenager who is promised in marriage to Louis-Auguste, played by Jason Schwartzman, in order to unite the countries of France and Austria, and it carries on till just shy of her execution.  Dunst is magically able to manipulate her character so effortlessly that the audience is baffled at Marie's subtle and gradual growth as a young Queen.  Schwartzman does a wonderful job playing the young husband, a man too young for the responsibility on his shoulders and too uninterested for the wife he's been given despite her beauty and magnetism.  One could say he's overwhelmed, maybe even a bit frightened.

Sophia Coppola brilliantly scripted this masterpiece; everything from the dialog to the musical soundtrack is inventive, effective and refreshing.  The script is especially noteworthy, giving the royal courts a modern twist that resembles the tabloid covers that litter the concession stands each week.  Having long sequences of murmured gossip, whispered rumors and lust centered jealousy help make for a memorable and relatable experience.  The costume designs and set pieces are magical and add so many lavish layers to the already layered biopic.  The scenes blossoming forth with colorful fabrics, high fashion inspired shoes and pastries add visual depth to the reality that this Queen was just like every other young girl and helps make her more real to us.

Marie Antoinette's devotion to her newfound country is stifled by her husband's refusal to consummate their marriage and her dire frustration in her inability to provide an heir that would unite her birthland with her homeland transcends right to the audience.  Marie Antoinette was a tragically misunderstood woman who did all that she could in a situation she had no control over.

The supporting cast does a fine job as well, Judy Davis and Rip Torn sinking their teeth into their small roles, and Asia Argento is fantastically catty as the Kings mistress, but it's Rose Byrne that really stands out to me.  Her brazen obnoxious almost impish sexuality writhes off the screen and into the seat next to you and makes a very long lasting impression.  Danny Huston and Marianne Faithfull are brilliant if not sorely underused, but like I've stated, this movie is all about Marie Antoinette and its focus from her never wavers.  She's in just about every frame and as we watch her move from nave young girl to loving mother and wife to confused, hated and betrayed Queen we are moved for her, to her and with her in this brilliantly paced and expertly crafted masterpiece.",1182384000,2,3511,4.918644067796611
1579449,4,B00005JPAS,"Director Sofia Coppola continues her focus on emotionally frustrated young women in her third feature film, ""Marie Antoinette"", adapted from Antonia Fraser's popular biography of the last Queen of France who met her end at the guillotine. This film will do nothing to resolve the debate over the director's talent or lack thereof, since Ms. Coppola has chosen to make a stylized, candied presentation of already controversial characters in a politically complex 18th century context that the French take pretty seriously. Its purpose is partly to rehabilitate Marie Antoinette's image in the eyes of Americans, who tend to regard her as a wastrel with contempt for the common people. Having studied this period of history while in France, I can say that the French view Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as the least  to blame for France's economic crisis and Revolution.

In 1768, to cement an alliance between Austria and France, the Empress Maria Theresa betroths her youngest daughter to the French Dauphin. The 14-year-old, trepidatious Archduchess (Kirsten Dunst) marries the shy prince (Jason Schwartzman), only slightly older than herself, and becomes Marie Antoinette, Dauphine of France. In addition to the loss of privacy and oppressive protocols of the French court, the young Dauphine is expected to produce an heir. Yet her husband, though kind and respectful, won't have sex with her. In 1774, King Louis XV dies and his son ascends the throne as Louis XVI, making Marie Antoinette Queen of France. Years of pressure to consummate her marriage finally end with the birth of a daughter. But France has huge debts, bread shortages, and revolutionaries do all they can to paint the King and Queen as villains.

""Marie Antoinette"" is self-consciously eye candy. It's a baroque visual feast of crisp, vivid pastels. There is little dialogue. Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles is expressed visually through a dynamic camera that seems to float, sumptuous production design, and countless scenes of the Queen and courtiers doing nothing of importance. It's not about matters of state. This is a kind of prolonged vignette illustrating the humiliation, confinement, and extraordinary luxuries that defined Marie Antoinette's lifestyle, and how this effusive, affectionate woman coped with it all, successfully or not. The sets, costumes, and hair styles are stylizations, not intended to be entirely accurate but to convey the kid-in-a-candy-store indulgence with which Marie Antoinette consoled herself in the years before she had children.

This all works well until Marie Antoinette becomes a mother at age 23. As she aged, the Queen mostly abandoned her spendthrift ways and tried to sacrifice for France to the extent that a person so isolated could. The film tries awkwardly to express this and ends up being rather muddled. Two of her children died. The tone of Marie Antoinette's life changed. The tone of the film doesn't. The inclusion of her alleged affair with Count Ferson seems incongruous. The result is that the film's second half is unclear and ineffectual. Where a broad emotional portrait of her life at Versailles allows unique insight into Marie Antoinette's youth, her later life cannot be understood without more structured and intricate storytelling.

Liberties taken with details and design aside, I expect French viewers will dislike ""Marie Antoinette"" on the basis of language alone. The French language reached its height in the late 18th century, and the ability to speak cleverly and beautifully was highly prized at Court. But words in this film are simple and sparse. It has been definitely established that dialogue is not Sofia Coppola's forte. But her intention here is to shift focus away from manners and onto emotions, which may be appropriate. I think ""Marie Antoinette"" succeeds as a fresh, innovative way to understand this ill-fated Queen's emotional life up to a point. But the MTV-inspired style is less suitable as Marie Antoinette ages and she exchanges old pressures for new. 3  stars.

The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 2 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2  min), a theatrical teaser (1  min), and 2 featurettes. ""The Making of Marie Antoinette"" (25 min) features on-set interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes footage, discussions of the film's themes with Sofia Coppola, and interviews with the film's creative team about production and costume design, colors, lighting, and more. In ""Cribs with Louis XVI"" (3  min) Jason Schwartzman takes us on a tour of his palace at Versailles in the style of MTV's ""Cribs"". Subtitles are available for the film in English and French.

1579530,4,B00005JPAS,"I read Antonia Fraser's biography because I wanted to read the book that had inspired the movie.  The beauty and opulence of Versailles are captured on film for all to see (with actor Jason Schwartzman giving us an MTVish tour of Louis XVI's ""crib"" in the special features).  The interior design and costume crew deserve Oscar considerations as does Kirsten Dunst's ""pitch perfect"" (Roger Ebert) performance.

I'm glad that at long last Marie Antoinette can be acquitted of two centuries of slander and libel.  She at long last receives her ""day in court"" through Sofia Coppola's movie and Antonia Fraser's book, though I feel the book does a better job of portraying Marie Antoinette sympathetically. The point of Fraser's book wasn't that Marie Antoinette ""defied both royalty and commoner by living like a rock star, which served only to seal her fate"" (the movie's description of the ""isolated"" queen).  At least, I don't think that that was the point of the biography.  Yes, Marie Antoinette partied hard and lived it up for awhile, but that died down when she became a mother.  The whole movie seems to focus on this stage of Marie Antoinette's life, as though she remained in this constant phase of party girl and extravagance until her arrest.  The book helps us to decipher fact from fiction about this enigmatic woman.  And this irresponsible party mode is more myth than reality in terms of describing the bulk of Marie Antoinette's adult life, especially after motherhood.

The anachronistic music didn't bother me--I understand Sofia Coppola's desire to make history seem modern and relevant.  The music really helps us see Marie Antoinette as a teenager, with an 18th-century teen angst twist that would make John Hughes proud.

You never really get a sense of the passage of time in this movie.  Perhaps this was Sofia Coppola's intent as she wanted this to be an ""impressionistic rendering"" of life according to Marie Antoinette. Kirsten Dunst looks as young as she did when she first entered the court of Versaille at fifteen as she does when she leaves it in her mid-thirties.

I think that if the Affair of the Necklace had been included in this movie, it would have added to the dialogue--which has been accused of being stagnant.  Plus, that incident is just so interesting, and this ""labyrinth"" (as Marie Antoinette called the affair) would have shown yet another misrepresented incident that had the effect of the queen losing even more ground with the public.

The guy who plays Marie Antoinette's extramarital love interest is quite the hottie, and his character (the Swedish Count Fersen) is the only person whom Antonia Fraser believes actually had an affair with the queen (or at least the only affair that is somewhat substantiated and not mere rumor).

All in all, this movie is visually breathtaking and does allow us to see what life must have been like for Marie Antoinette when she first arrives at Versailles.  It's hard to imagine forcing a young girl of fourteen or fifteen to leave everything she knows in order to travel to a foreign country and marry a teenage boy she has never met, all while living in a fishbowl.",1182038400,4,3155,4.876404494382022

I am really not a fan of hers, and thus why I stayed away from this movie for so long. But, finally....This is her best movie thus far, but only she could set rock tunes to an old story. I didn't mind that so much. It's interesting. However off kelter this depiction is, it's none the less fascinating, and original. The set,and costume design is fantastic. Kierstin Dunst does a fabulous job. The movie is odd, and the frustrating thing is that a lot of the script is mumbled, and makes it hard to understand. What you do understand is a very weak script, without much to it. The drama and climaxes are swept over, and there seem to lack any character development. Weirdly, the preview tells you more about the chronology than the movie itself.  The ending is not too abrupt, but leaves you wanting to know more.

It is the isolation of an arrogant, scared, defensive person. The characters in her movies are all dumb cartoons except the people that are standing in for her. Think about it. Its a heck of a way to see the world. Look at how she depicts Spike Jonze and Cameron Diaz in Lost and Translation. Or even most of the Japanese people. Or James Woods and Kathleen Turner in Virgins. Or the royal family. No one has a clue except her. No wonder she is so lonely. But it's adolescent. Its teenage stuff. The idea that you are the only one in the world that knows anything is something that everyone feels for a moment during teenage years, but then you grow up and get out of your room and realize that you aren't that special. and that you are. and that everyone is. sofia coppola is still stuck in her room and hell bent on proving that she is special. and that you are not. and the masses are not. so there.",1181865600,3,1209,4.401785714285714

This is one of those movies that is ultimately forgettable. It's the kind of movie that in a year or two you'll remember seeing it, but you won't really be able to remember what happened. I think somebody already beat me at saying it, but it seems like the movie was mostly about Kirsten Dunst eating cake and drinking wine for two hours, but that's only when she wasn't buying shoes, clothes, and hats. Other than that, she was married to a man that wouldn't have sex with her..SO WHAT! I felt so mislead after reading the coverbox to this film in the video store. I couldn't believe they referred to this character as a villianess who lived life on her own terms. A woman who didn't walk the line between royalty and being a commoner. I saw none of that at all, but I did see beautiful cinematography and costumes. Even the intentional use of music (very bad music) that wasn't even apart of that era didn't help this movie out. I turned this movie off and took a nap at least twice before I finished it which is never a good sign.

However the film was certainly not interesting and was a complete waste of my time and I actually wanted to walk out of the cinema hall half way through this non-event of a film.

(If I were Antonia Fraser I would sue the people who made this for libel.) Yes, as a lot of people have said, the costumes and sets were gorgeous, but over one half of the movie was essentially saying, ""Boy - those French aristocrats sure knew how to party!"" Also, there was virtually no inkling anywhere that there was a world outside Versailles until all of a sudden this mob shows up with torches and pitchforks. Considering how little a lot of people know about history, I'm sure that a lot of them were scratching their heads and saying to each other, ""Gee - why are those people so mad?"" (Oh, someone at some point does say that the people have no bread, at which point Marie Antoinette utters her most famous non-quote, ""Let them eat cake."")

If the makers of this movie had actually READ the book that they were supposed to be basing it on, this COULD have been a good movie. The actors seemed to be competent, and a far more interesting film could have been made if they had spent maybe the first 15 minutes on Marie's early days in France and used the rest to show how much she grew and matured over the years. (They still could have used the pretty sets and clothes.)

Then there was the ending. I sat there stunned, saying, ""That's it?"" Somebody said something along the lines of ""Well, we all know how it ends,"" but I wouldn't count on that, and showing the dignity that Marie displayed during her trial and the abuse that she received at the hands of the revolutionaries, even if they didn't show the actual execution, would have provided a moving contrast to the early scenes.

Movies that make me think and where I really have to pay attention to physical clues are great.  I wouldn't say this movie is so much slow as IT DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL!  The dialogue in this movie would probably fit on less that 10 pages of paper.  And most of it doesn't even pertain much to the story.  Let's see what happens in this movie... (I guess spoiler warning?) Marie goes to France and gets married to a guy who won't have sex with her.  Then the king dies leaving her queen and her husband king.  She buys some trees (small ones mind you, not fully grown).  Finally her brother convinces her husband to have sex with her.  They have 2 kids.  Then France rebels and they have to leave.  The end!  Yay, I just saved you having to watch the movie!  To make the lack of plot and dialogue even worse, the dialogue there is, is poorly mixed with the music.

When you watch the ""making of"" feature you see how this whole disgrace happened and it's too sad. I agree with other reviews that the book and this film bear no relation save in name only. The only star is given for the set, costumes, and props some of which were re-used for different shots and therefore NOT like the real french court at all.

1579604,4,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette is one of those historical figures who will always excite our curiousity--from our very modern perspective we wonder, perhaps, how could someone be so blind to the world around them, how bad could it really be to live in the center of a court dedicated to pleasure? Very bad indeed--and Coppola convinces us of it, which is an accomplishment. Marie is the youngest daughter of the powerful Austrian Empress, sent off at the age of 15 to France. She's a pretty unspoiled child, who is stripped of everything she knows--her maids, her dog, her clothes--and turned into a gorgeously dressed doll to be presented to the rapacious court as the next queen of France. Dunst does a lovely job, by turns frivolous, reckless, sympathetic and loving. She and Louis XVI are really just a pair of clueles teenagers, deliberately shut off from the world by a court filled with schemers. To Dunst's credit, she portrays Marie as a child who manages to mature into a loving mother and caring wife.

At first I too was puzzled by the music, the dialogue, the dreamy progress from scene to scene. But would English with a French accent be any more authentic than English with an American or British accent? I don't think so. Once you get past that, the film is a visual feast, and Coppola won an Oscar for costume design. Many complain that the movie ends when the royal couple leave Versailles, but we know what happens next, don't we?

1579605,1,B00005JPAS,"I was given this DVD for Mother's Day.  What a disappointment it was.  On discussion with others who have seen it, the consensus is similar: Kirsten Dunst did nothing for the role and the film was not only historically inaccurate, but even ignorant.  I admit that I knew in advance NOT to expect this to be any more than a lush expose of life at Versailles, shoes by Manolo, beautiful dresses etc, but REALLY!!  The characters are so one dimensional and the film ends before the family is whisked off to Paris to await their eventual executions.  I am almost through the book, written by Antonia Fraser, who is a prolific writer of European history.  The book has been reprinted in an edition to go with this DVD and believe me, it is NOTHING like the film.  I can only think that the Coppola family needed some kind of tax write off and this was it.

There are so many wonderful possibilities for a film based around the travails of the royal family at this time.  It was such a disappointment then to see this one.  Even if viewed from a contemporary angle, with the royal family 'living like rockstars' it is a disaster.  Kirsten Dunst basically plays an idle indulged American teenager.  No one attempts a French accent (which may be a good thing), but there are a smattering of other accents thrown in.  Marie Antoinette's mother, the formidable Marie Therese of Austria is played by Marianne Faithfull (for all of about 5 seconds) with an English accent.  The dissipated French King, Louis 15 is played by Rip Torn and he does this believably, but there is still little of and historical value or even recognition in this film.  Some of it is even downright wrong - according to the book it is ""loosely"" based on.

I really don't understand why they bothered at all.  I prefer to get my history via historical novels, not having the patience to wade through non-fiction. I'm making an exception with Antonia Fraser's book on this subject.  So I viewed this DVD happily aware that this film was choosing to take a 'lite' approach to history and events.  However I still felt completely ripped off and puzzled as to why anyone would waste time and money on such a project.  Lets hope someone at some stage makes some really good films on European history, given the access we have to materials and locations, special effects and scholarship.

1579606,4,B00005JPAS,"I had serious reservations about this film. I am a lifelong lover of Marie Antoinette and her story. 'The Journey' by Antonia Fraser is one of the best Marie Antoinette books I have ever read. When I heard who the director was for this film I was skeptical, but I finally had to buy the DVD. I like Kirsten Dunst.

The film has some very small details and events that are historically accurate. Marie Antoinette did indeed have to strip down nude in order to cross over into France, Louis XV was indeed interested in her bosom, and Marie Antoinette did stand shivering as her clothing was passed from one lady in waiting to another.

The French court and atmosphere was accurate on film, cold, haughty and uppity, and yes at times ridiculous. Du Barry was portrayed well as were Marie's close circle of friends. Louis XVI was played perfectly. In my personal opinion, I will believe to my dying day that Louis XVI was a homosexual. Seven years to consumate a marriage and the first king NEVER to have a mistress?? C'mon folks, it isn't hard to figure this out.

The costumes are magnificent. Kirstin Dunst is breathtakingly beautiful, and the luxrious life she lead in her early stages of her reign are pretty accuratly portrayed. Some find this film boring, I will admit that those who do not appreciate what this woman went through or what her life was all about, would find it boring. However the stage had to be set for what was about to come.

My biggest complaint is that there is no mention of the infamous Diamond Necklace episode. That event is as significant to the French Revolution as the fall of the Bastille. Yet the final scene we see the royal family leaving Versaille never to return. The movie ends just as the adventure, drama, and heartache of Marie Antoinette's life begins.

In my opinion this project cannot end here. It is a terrible waste to just leave it hanging here. What about the escape attempt in the Berlin? The September massacres? The Tower imprisonment? The war with Austria? The trial, and finally her long ride to the guillotine? If a part two were to be done correctly and with Kirsten returning to her role as the doomed Queen, Marie Antoinette part 2 could be as lavish, loved, and succesful as the movie Titanic.

For what the movie was, it was very good. I can honestly say I was not disappointed neither as a Marie Antoinette fan or a student. I think Kirsten was superb. I think for the period of her life that this film covered, it was very good and accurate. Lavish and boredom was the theme of her life until the Revolution began. But again, this movie is only half the story. I would recommend to anyone whio saw this movie to read 'The Journey' or any other Marie Antoinette biography.

1579620,5,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette, the third feature film of director Sofia Coppola, is one of the most visually impressive achievements of the decade.

Heir to a throne which was growing unpopular with its people, Antoinette grows from being vilified and lost in luxury to being a devoted mother ready to accept the fate dealt her with dignity.

Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) gives a beautifully convincing performance along side Jason Schwartzman as the Dauphin of France, Rip Torn (Louis XV), Judy Davis (la Comtesse de Noailles) and Asia Argento (Madame du Barry). Dunst says ""I was asked by Sofia to look at Marie Antoinette in a way that I had never considered a historical figure before."" Scenes involving more than one hundred actors were both planned intricately and completely improvised. Coppola comments that she used both techniques of acting to draw forth as much realism as she could.

The use of the anti-narrative technique that Coppola's fans are so familiar with, serves better to transport the audience. Coppola's omission of most of the political aspects of Antoinette's life was met with much criticism; however Coppola replies ""We weren't making a mini-series."" Deciding rather to focus on Marie Antoinette's personal life and growth within the one hundred and twenty-three minute film, we are given beautiful, Vermeer-esque shots: Marie reclining in the gilded bath, tasting pieces of cake on her fingers and giggling, the Dauphine with her friends rolling in the grass whilst watching the sun rise with champagne flutes in hand, hordes of villagers ceasing their yelling to watch the Queen bow before them on the balcony.

The opulence of Versailles in its hey-day is shown with great skill. The mise-en-scne throughout the film is flawless. The French Government granted Coppola unprecedented access to Versailles, which was where most of the filming took place. Coppola and costume designer Milena Canonero's use of dress, jewellery and shoes (now famously credited to Manalo Blahnik) was what attracted various nominations and awards, the most notable of was the Academy Award for Costume Design. The film was also nominated for many other awards for its Art Direction.

The retelling of the story ill-fated Queen is made complete with the addition of the carefully selected and now very popular soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marie-Antoinette/dp/B000ICLSQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marie Antoinette</a>) featuring alternative 80s and 90s music, such as Bow Wow Wow, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees and New Order.

I don't get it.  What is this movie about?  The main tension lies in the relationship between Louis XVI and his young wife, Marie Antoinette, the nice little country girl who comes to the big city (or so it would seem).  Seems our good king to be isn't too into the whole marriage thing, and would rather go out hunting or read history books in bed than have sex with his pretty wife.  Apparently, this is a problem for Marie, since an unconsummated marriage isn't fully legit. Whatever, she just goes back to playing cards, or giggling with the girls.  Sometimes she just walks down the hall, a very serious expression on her face, and then we get admire her new dress.  Kirsten Dunst gets to wear some really nice dresses.  Actually, the entire movie is visually very beautiful, but graphics technology being as it is, that seems more a prerequisite of a good film rather than a hallmark of one.

There isn't enough meat in the story to last the whole two hours and however many minutes.

1579629,4,B00005JPAS,"We watched this one because of our fall 2006 trip to Versailles and because of our daughter's study of French in school. Kirsten Dunst, who plays the title role, is also a very beautiful and somewhat accomplished (two Spidermans; Eternal Sunshine; no doubt some others I haven't seen) actress that's becoming one of my favorites of her generation (along with the wonderful Natalie Portman).  Jason Schartzman, who plays the Dauphin Louis-Auguste and then King Louis, was terrific in ""Rushmore"".

Directed by Sofia Coppola (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00011RPB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>), ""Marie Antoinette"" is much more of a visual experience than a plot-driven story.  Marie, a princess in her own right in Austria, arrives at the Court of France as a 15-year old promised to Dauphin Louis-Auguste, a sluggish boy of 16 with a passion for locksmithing.  She tries her best to ingratiate herself to Louis, to adjust to the attentions of the court, and eventually to enjoy all that is available.

The movie features the most fantastic depiction of desserts ever filmed (at least for a Hollywood production) and also some of the most outlandish hairdos (many of which resemble pastries).  However, once she becomes mother to a dauphine and the long-awaited new dauphin, Marie becomes more serious about her role, to the extent that this is possible in the hothouse of Versailles.  Dunst is brilliant as the young, confused and eventually giddy Marie; she struggles somewhat with the more serious depiction near the end---perhaps that's intentional to convey Marie's actual struggle in the situation.

Schwartzman was disappointingly flat as Louis--I think that the writers and Coppola could have made better use of this talented actor.  There's also some heavy innuendo (and a little more) about Marie's relationship with a Swedish soldier (and perhaps the fatherhood of the dauphin) which I've read is not well-supported by history, though it adds a note of tension to the story.

Most memorable are the scenes where we watch Marie attended to by 15 or 20 courtiers, led by Judi Davis (each with a particular role, determined by seniority) as she rises in the morning, and the even larger group in attendance as she delivers the couple's first child.  Talk about needing privacy.  We also enjoyed seeing the mini-palace and country ""cottage"" that Louis had built for Marie after the birth of each child.  We saw the palace and walk the cottage grounds (it was a working farm of sorts) when we visited last year.

A little offputting, probably for me moreso than younger viewers, is Coppola's use of modern pop music in the score.  My thought all along was that Mozart and others wrote some beautiful music that would have fit the scene better and sounded just as good.  Still, I guess she felt she needed more of a hook to younger audiences than the appearance of Dunst.  To Coppola's credit, she ends the film well short of depicting the historical end for the King and Queen of France; another plus for young viewers.  All in all, ""Marie Antoinette"" is an engaging and informative movie, certainly appropriate for adults and all teenagers.",1178236800,,3232,5.206563706563706

1579713,1,B00005JPAS,"I watched this movie mainly because this was Sofia Coppola's latest movie since ""Lost in Translation"", which I loved.

And so the first 15 minutes or so of this movie was enthralling, to see the same sensitivity to mood and style, and to hear this wonderful background music that was vaguely reminiscent of her last movie.

Coppola made a great effort to be accurate to the latest scholarly re-telling of the story of Marie Antoinette.

But the telling of this story rapidly got old.  Going through all the details in the life of a spoiled, un-intellectual, filthy rich Queen of France, surrounded by sycophants and schemers, turned out to be hugely boring.

We all know how the story of Marie Antoinette ended, but the movie stopped well short of that ending.  This was the single greatest flaw of this movie - it went into so much detail as to how the young woman lived, from the very beginning to the height of her powers, and yet did not deal with the part of the story that made this otherwise vapid personality so interesting.

The story of Marie Antoinette's imprisonment and execution, the story of the loss of her one remaining son (who subsequently died after terrible mistreatment at the hands of the revolutionaries), the story of what happened to the lovely child who was her firstborn, these stories are what make Marie Antoinette the tragic figure who continues to fascinate us.

And unfortunately, Sofia Coppola left out the best parts of this story.",1177891200,8,1466,4.766798418972332
1579714,4,B00005JPAS,"I can think out of the box but, in this case, the visually stunning and well-scripted ""Marie Antoinette"" is negatively impacted by a soundtrack that comes off as a stunt and adds nothing that I can observe. It's difficult for film makers to achieve that experience of giving the viewer a feeling of looking in a time portal to a historical period. The way we can only imagine people acted at that time is a significant achievement by any film maker and director Sofia Coppola does that. The characters in this film are 18th century portraits and illustrations come to life. We never really get to know these people but I don't think that is the intention. It's more like we're strangers visiting the court on a royal invite. It's unfotunate that the soundtrack unravels the proceedings at those relatively few times it makes itself heard.",1177718400,,838,4.7465753424657535
1579715,3,B00005JPAS,"I take umbrage at the notion that I ""just don't get it"" if I don't think this is a five-star film. That's utter nonsense. I watched it, and I got it - and while some parts of it worked, overall, I found it unsatisfying.

The film started with potential. It took great pains to demonstrate what Marie Antoinette was losing in order to forge an alliance with France. When she arrives at the French border, a tent straddles it. She enters the tent on the Austrian side, is forced to give up her dog and all of her clothes (everything Austrian), and she is garbed in French clothes and told that she can have as many French dogs as she likes. She exits on the French side, ready to meet the dauphin. A wonderful ""show don't tell"" example.

I felt that far too much time was spent examining superficial aspects of her life. She spent money, she gambled. She spent too much money. She gambled too much. OK. She's a party girl. I get it. Later in the film, we find that she had three children, and then we are shown that one died in a scene that lasted for twenty seconds: a picture was hung on the wall that showed the Marie with three children; then it was taken down and replaced with a picture of Marie and two children. To some this might seem clever. I thought it was self indulgent. Her affair was glanced over, and her hatred in the hearts of the French people shown in a voiceover that echoed her most infamous quote: Let them eat cake. To a bored observer (I was watching the movie with one such), this is easily missed.

The soundtrack, a mix of period music and New Order/Adam and the Ants/Bow Wow Wow seemed as confused as the movie. If something doesn't add anything - i.e., contemporary music to a period drama - then it doesn't belong. My feeling was that the music (all of which I'm a fan of, by the way) detracted from the story being told.

So did the unconventional casting decisions. Jason Schwarzman as Louis XVI? Molly Shannon? Rip Torn? I have enjoyed each in other works, but they were as out of place as a mobster at a tea party.

What did work were the costumes, the orgiastic parties of champagne and confections, and the portrayal of the queen as a tart. But this is, of course, a superficial examination. This was a skin deep movie that didn't attempt to dig. And Kirsten Dunst, another whose work I enjoy, didn't dig deep here. But that wasn't her fault. She wasn't given a shovel, and one can only do so much with their nails.

There is absolutely zero discernable arc for any of the characters, least of all Marie Antoinette herself. There are so many long, boring shots (yes, even the cinematography here is uninspired) of Kirsten Dunst either A) lying down B) walking in a straight line C) standing still. Wouldn't you know, the ending puts all three together in a glorious display of inertia. Even the attempt to throw modern music into the mix feels like it was a post-production afterthought, something Coppola thought would be, like, cool. Or something.

1579717,4,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette brings to the screen the story of the Austrian princess that blossomed into the Queen of France only to become one of the most well known victims of the French Revolution.

The movie follows a pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of the life of Marie Antoinette.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Marie Antoinette, and her life at Versailles, and on the other (and to a much lesser extent), several events leading to the French Revolution (1789).

The movie portrays superbly life at the Palace, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.

We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's involvement in the American Revolution (beginning in 1778).

Moreover, we get to see or hear about the lies and propaganda that helped shift public opinion against the Queen.

The film is also excellent in showing that King Louis XVI did not wish to rule and was forced into that position following the death of his grandfather Louis XV.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) The TERRIBLE music with the exception of those moments when the music of the time can be heard.

2) The movie is at times very slow, which breeds annoyance.

3) Marie Antoinette had four children yet we only see three.

4) Focusing too much on life in the Palace at the expense of historical events.

Kirsten Dunst does a GREAT job as Marie Antoinette, though Jason Schwartzman (of all people!) portraying Louis XVI was a poor choice to say the least.

Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!

Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will provide for an evening's entertainment.

The abrupt ending allows for a great cliffhanger so a sequel is in order.

Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu) for those with a soft spot for French History.",1177632000,,2188,5.002762430939226

1579719,4,B00005JPAS,"If anyone in history deserved an homage in the form of a biopic directed by Sofia Coppola, it was certainly Marie Antoinette.  The consort to King Louis XVII of France lived a life undoubtedly pretty on the outside, at least until the fall of Versailles, so that the film is one of the most aesthetically pleasing affairs in recent history is hardly surprising.

One may think it is a shame that Coppola chose to portray the window of time from Marie's entrance into France in May 1770 until the fall of Versailles in October 1789.  After all, most of the interesting events in her life took place after that, when she was stripped of her rights and eventually executed in 1793 (semi-spoiler: the film makes no mention of anything after 1789).  However, while Coppola's choice may make for a boring plot to those searching for a typical American drama, it also makes for an interesting and moving portrayal of a privileged but misunderstood young woman in another time and place.

The film, though deeply sympathetic, highlights the excesses of the queen's life.  The selection of 80s rock in the soundtrack draws parallels with a time of excess that the audience may more immediately understand.  Coppola's trademark ethereality transports viewers not to mid-18th century France, but to another world altogether.  Coppola could have tried to make a broad and contemporarily pertinent social statment about the extravagance of people in power, but instead she intentionally removes the audience as far from reality as possible, focusing on a character study of a noteworthy historical figure.

This, of course, requires a great actress to bring the package together.  While there are scads of actresses who probably could have played the role better (the acerbic but striking Emily Blunt comes to mind), Kirsten Dunst does something different in this film from what most viewers would probably expect.  While she is often prone to roles that make her chatter and talk about her feelings, Coppola has supplied Dunst with a role that finally allows her to act with her body, her face, and her intense eyes.  Viewers may cringe in the film's first hour at Dunst's all-too-familiar childlike waifness, but midway through the film she is forced to grow up and becomes an actress of a higher and more subtle order than we've seen  before.  One should note that Coppola particularly handles the famed ""let them eat cake"" dillemma with ease and unmistakable flair, and the nicely maturing Dunst pulls the package together remarkably.

Judy Davis, Rip Torn and Jason Schwartzman hand in performances as skilled as one should expect from them, but this is a film for Dunst, Coppola, and most of all, Marie Antoinette herself.  Recommended.",1177372800,2,2729,5.004424778761062

Although not, strictly speaking, an exact rendering of the character and time, it is a deeply satisfying bit of eye candy. The costumes and yes, the SHOES, are worth viewing the movie. It is well-acted, and the scenery and location are just gorgeous. This movie is more an artist's impression of Marie Antonette; I believe this movie is meant to be a sumptious watercolor of her life, rather than a documentary. It is a tribute to Marie Antonette's innocence and at the same time, an evaluation of her poor choices and the consequences.",1176940800,3,759,4.75
1579782,1,B00005JPAS,"If you've read the book this movie is EXTREMELY loosely based on, you will understand why the movie is so horrid. It's beautiful to look at, but that is all. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a Queen of France. This movie completely ignores the Revolution, Marie Antoinette's arrest, and murder. In short, the movie ignores anything that is not pretty, girlish, and light.

There is so much fluff and teen angst that it's hard to locate any fact in the film at all. Do we really need a 10 minute close-up of Kristen Dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man? Even one scene like this is bad enough, but it happens over and over. We see kids at play more than adults with real problems, and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling. There is shopping, food, dress up, and flirting, but minus a handful of very short scenes, no real account of the lives of the King and Queen of France.

 There was little in the way of dialog, and sadly much of what there was was murmured while Dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses. There is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it's almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog. For instance, the Dauphin and 2 brothers, which we are told in the book the film is ""based"" on. However, in the film, the brothers are combined into one, very inaccurate character. Marie Antoinette also had 2 sons, not one as the movie will tell you. I don't mind some changes for the sake of drama, but ignoring 90% of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous.

The main actors are also terrible. The supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, and Marriane Faithful, is wonderful. They only serve to make Kirsten Dunst look that much worse. No one bothers to act French, or like the poised rulers-in-training that their characters were. The movie is so obviously a vehicle for Dunst that it's sickening. There is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there. Remember the 10 minute scene I described where she does nothing but smile? It keeps happening. It gets very, very old. It feels more like a photo shoot for Dunst than a film. I usually like Kirsten Dunst, but not in this film.

Overall, the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one. There just isn't enough going on to warrant the film's length, and it's really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses, food, and shopping, but have no taste for fact. It's a chick flick at it's worst, and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person.

1579784,3,B00005JPAS,"This is a visually sumptuous film. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design, it rightly won that Oscar. That being said, it was the only Oscar for which it could possibly have been nominated, as the film itself was a disappointment. As a lover of period dramas, I eagerly rented this film. Not even its visual beauty, however, could keep me fully engaged in a film that simply does not tell a cohesive story. Unless one is fully familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette, the film will impart little to one's knowledge of the time, place, and people. As with a meringue, a frothy, delicious confection that promises much, one will find little of substance after one bite.

Kirsten Dunce gives a tender performance as Marie Antoinette, a young Austrian princess thrust into a role that she did not seek, who is forced to leave all that she knew and loved in order to forge an alliance between Austria and France. An ephemeral portrait of this much maligned historical figure emerges, one that is somewhat sympathetic. Moreover, the use of rock music in the film is an interesting choice, as it serves to remind the viewer that Marie Antoinette was a young girl, not much different than young girls of today, with hopes and desires of her own. Yet, hers had to be sublimated. Without something of a cogent and compelling narrative, however, the story of Marie Antoinette falls by the wayside.

While the social climate of France, which serves as a necessary counterpoint for the excesses of Marie Antoinette's court, is alluded to, it is little more of a blip in the film. This social event that caused two worlds to eventually collide, as the French Revolution became a reality rather than just a political theory, remains as elusive as the focal point of the film itself. The historical context of Marie Antoinette's reality, that is, the events that propelled her into the annals of history, is barely a footnote.

Although the story of Marie Antoinette is historically a poignant one, the director, Sofia Coppola, simply  fails to tell a cohesive story, as the film meanders along, a tribute to extravagance and beauty but little else. This film, therefore, remains an elevation of form over substance. While loosely based upon a biography of Marie Antoinette by Antonia Fraser, it is little wonder that the author went on the record to disavow herself of this film.  I can also fully understand why this film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival. It is simply little more that a yawn yarn, though a visually enticing one. Unfortunately, the film's stunning visuals are not enough to fill the empty shell of this film.

She has mixed a story based on the life of this fascinating historical figure with modern rock music and that seems to make parallels with Marie Antoiniette's life with that of modern-day celebrities.  After all, she was quite frivolous at some point -- spending astronomical amounts of money on jewelry and clothes, having lavish parties and being the focus of vicious gossip (like the whole, ""Let them eat cake!"" misquote).  When put into that context, I suppose Marie Antoinette's life was not all that different from a famous person from the 21st century.  This film does paint a more sympathetic look into the young queen's life with her struggles with giving King Louis XVI's an heir.  This film implies that he had been the one to blame, for he had no sexual appetite, but it was never proven whose fault it was, or if indeed there was someone to blame.  Historically, it does address some of the things the queen went through -- like having to relinquish her Austrian roots, getting dressed every morning by her ladies-in-waiting, the king's insatiable appetite for food, and many of the things that led to the French Revolution.  However, this film felt extremely rushed at the end and I didn't like the fact that there was nothing shown about her tragic demise when she was beheaded for supposedly committing treason. That is not to say that the film isn't great.  Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job with the title role.  She brought in Marie's innocent and frivolous side as well as the more human, vulnerable side.

I have never been a Dunst fan but she is surprisely good as the doomed Marie Antoinette. Dunst plays the Queen of France very reserved, motherly, and understanding towards her husband's ""bedroom issues.""

I will admit that, while I still like the fictitious novel a lot better, this movie is even more beautiful than Coppola's Virgin Suicides which a lot of people don't get either.  See, that's the great thing about art films; you can put your own interpretation on them, and that's a definite plus.

Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, vulnerable, and believable as one of the most hated queens in history, and Coppola's touch with the new romantic era music is right on the mark as so many of those early 80s groups mimicked the attire worn back then.  Beautiful costumes and sets are a feast for the eyes, and the music is a real blast for anybody who loves Coppola's fresh and invigorating ideas.  You don't have to agree with those of us who like the movie, but you sure have to admit it's gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack fits Coppola's style.  If you've seen the Virgin Suicides, you will understand this movie better.  I will maintain that I had to do some studying before I watched it for the second time, or my rating may have been lower too.

1579846,4,B00005JPAS,"If I could give this film 4.5 stars, I would. It wasn't quite 5 stars - to me, that's brilliance, perfection. But this film was really quite good. Granted it's definitely Sofia Coppola's vision of the young Marie Antoinette, but that's what makes her work HERS (just like any director puts their imprint on a film). And it was never invasive. It was artful. And what a feast for the eyes and ears! I loved the mix of period dress and the gorgeousness of Versailles combined with modern language and music. I didn't expect to like it. I'd heard so many people dismiss the film, and yet, after viewing it, I find it hard to believe that it was actually ""booed."" That is far too harsh a criticism for a film that truly moved this viewer.

I think the film captured what it could have been like to be the young Queen, torn from one's family to become the focus of intense judgement, expectation, and speculation. A great sense of longing and loneliness pervaded the film, and even though there was so much beauty to behold, the viewer never loses touch with Marie's desire for some sense of fulfillment. The use of punk music absolutely added to this by emphasizing that sense of raging against the machine that we've all felt as a teen or young adult under pressure.

Hats off to Ms. Dunst's skillful acting (her best work, in my opinion) and Ms. Coppola's visionary direction.

If you let it, this film can be a surprising inspiration. And isn't that what art is all about?",1175817600,5,1471,4.522556390977444

1579848,5,B00005JPAS,"Having heard that the film was accompanied by rock music I did not think I was going to enjoy or appreciate it.  I was wrong.  This film is a masterpiece and I think time will only underline the fact.

Much has been made of Marie-Antoinette being empty-headed, frivolous and capricious.  She was a victim of circumstance, but she was also a victim of France, a France that idolised and idealised her from the moment she stepped over the border.  Which adolescent today, married to the most eligible man in Europe, feted by one and all, and given carte blanche would have done as well as the Austrian Archduchess?  I venture to say none.  Kirsten Dunst, whilst not looking like Marie-Antoinette is, nevertheless, Marie-Antoinette.  She is entirely credible and captures our sympathies without the film being anything but true to history.

I loved Judy Davis - the Comtesse de Noailles - and the fabulous episode where Marie-Antoinette, naked and reduced to shivering irritation in her vast bedroom as one Princess of the Blood supplants another in the competition to pass her her chemise (the original historical episode, reported by Madame de Campan was even more protracted than in the film!) - eventually Marie-Antoinette mutters, 'Mais c'est ridicule!' to which Madame Etiquette, far more regal than her mistress retorts, 'Non, Madame, this is Versailles!'

There were three jarring notes in the film - Marie-Antoinette is addressed as 'Your Majesty' and she and Louis-Auguste likewise as 'Your Majesties' before Louis XV is dead.  Most certainly lse-majest!  The other error is when the Comtesse de Noailles makes a breathless and delightfully histrionic entry into the dining-room to invite Louis and Antoinette de come for the confinement of the Comtesse de Provence.  Madame de Provence, whose husband was the unlikeable younger brother of Louis XVI, and later Louis XVIII, is thought possibly to have been lesbian and she never once gave birth.  The Comtesse d'Artois, wife of Louis XVI's youngest brother, was the one who pipped Marie-Antoinette to the post and produced 'Enfants de France' before the births of Marie-Therese-Charlotte and the first Dauphin.  But these dfauts can only niggle those who, like myself, are nit-pickers for historical veracity.

The film itself was a triumph in the fresh details - the scenes of Marie-Antoinette and the charming little girl who played her daughter in the garden at Trianon, the strange but oddly convincing admixture of American-English and French not a barrier to belief.

Kirsten Dunst was breathtakingly beautiful, fresh, convincing and vulnerable.  Yolande de Polignac had a certain vulgar rapaciousness that must have been quite near the truth (was I alone in believing I saw her 'sniff something' at the Trianon party?).  And the faithful and good Princesse de Lamballe - exquisitely played.  Jason Schwartzman as Louis was certainly too good-looking (in the pre-release photographs I assumed he had to be Axel von Fersen) though Robert Morley's memorable depiction in the Norma Shearer film was perhaps unnecessarily boorish and something of a caricature.  Marianne Faithful was the Empress Maria-Theresia to a 'T' in her black widow's dress.  Breeding will out.

I think the film will stand the test of time and I believe that it is as near as we will come to a reincarnation of Marie-Antoinette herself.  I do hope that Coppola will consider making the second half of the Queen's life, harrowing as that will of necessity be.",1175558400,4,3491,5.138053097345133

Because the flim-viewing public was assuredly taken in by the critical response to ""Lost in Translation,"" Sofia Coppola was foisted upon us as the new infant terrible and translating into English this is certainly true. She single-handedly brought down ""The Godfather"" Trilogy and has now taken ""Marie Antoinette"" to the depths of boredom. I thought the Norma Shearer version was vaccuous, but this new version takes the cake (pardon my French or the pun. Oh, dear, Coppola rubbing off on me!).

With a remarkable design team who received their inspiration from God knows where, Ms. Coppola has produced a lackluster film that belongs with her father's ""One From the Heart."" You might call it ""One From the Armpit."" With a babel of accents from Kristen Dunst's flat American through the gravelly spendor of Marianne Faithful, Ms. Coppola doesn't know if her film is a mocumentary or an MTV video.

The overall effect of this mishmash is a cinematic attrocity. I haven't seen ""Virgin Suicides"" and I'm not planning on ever putting myself through the annui.

It would have helped to show more contrast between the lavish lifestyle of the aristocrats and poor subjects. For younger people and people not familiar with history, the point is that the subjects were starving while royalty continued to indulge themselves.

Kirstin Dunst was fine as Marie Antoinette, but I felt that Jason Schwartzman seemed out of place as Louis XVI. I wanted to rip his wig off his head and yell ""Cut!"" He seemed very uncomfortable and awkward doing a period piece.

I did enjoy Jamie Dornan, a nice piece of eye candy, as Count Fersen.

After a 2 hour party, the tension was finally building and I felt cheated when the film ended abruptly. (For everyone who didn't pay attention in history class, Marie antoinette was beheaded.)

With such a high production value, it was a shame that we didn't learn more about Marie Antoinette prior to arriving in France and after leaving Versailles. It's like after all the partying, I was left with a hangover.

""The dreams have no dream. Just as the technicolour heroes do not allow us to forget for a second that they are normal people, type-cast public faces and investments, so under the thin tinsel of schematically produced fantasy emerges in unmistakable outline the skeleton of cinema-ontology, the whole obligatory hierarchy of values, th canon of the undesirable or the exemplary. There is nothing more practical than escape, nothing more fervently espoused to big business: we are abducted into the distance only to have the laws of empiricist living hammered from afar, unhampered by empirical possibilities of evasion, into our own consciousness. The escape is full of message. And message, the opposite, looks what it is: the wish to flee from flight. It reifies the resistance to reification.""

- Theodore Adorno, MINIMA MORALIA

This movie is an American TURKEY and is less about France of the *ancien regime* and more a Girl Gone Wild in costume (except when naked at the Austro/French border.)

The only ""beauty"" is the existing artistry of the Louvre and Versailles, and a tourist could have recorded that. To this, the directors add a pointless ""rock"" score that doesn't work. A rock and roll sound track could have worked, but this one is basically the eternal (ewige) male voice of rock and roll, advising La Antoinette to put out.

The dialectic is conspicuous by its absence. I would have felt sorry for Marie A had I'd got to see her dragged through the streets in a tumbril to the place of execution as drawn on the spot by David, but the directors of this execrable film were the sort of Californians who are like, who's David, man, is he a friend of yourn?

The movie, pure Thesis, asserts that art 'n beauty 'n poetry, all that chick stuff, was created by the leading figures of the *ancien regime* and boo most assuredly hoo that the ignorant mob destroyed it.

News fa lash. What Elvis Costello would and has called All This Useless Beauty was created by the proletariat and the middle class of the 17th and the 18th century. We retain the natural right to destroy it when it turns against us. Aristos and CEOs make NOTHING.

The most musical of Marie Antoinette's contemporaries sponsored Bach (a middle class workadaddy) and Frederick the Great's sole composition seems to have been the Hohenfriedberger March.

Hey, that's great, Fred.

Marie Antoinette is presented as sponsoring the extension of Versailles. Movies often do this. Subconsciously limning capitalist relations as the only possible relations, they make it appear that ""visionaries"" create palaces by speaking to flunkies.

What's the reality? The reality is that when Versailles was under construction, Marie's husband's great-grandfather Louie (Louie) quatorze wanted the first great French artist, the sublime Poussin, to work for him.

Louie Louie wanted Nick not so much to paint the visions Nick began to see in his mind's eye, visions of a cold passion, but Louie's stupid demi-victories in Louie's stupid wars. Some of those ""victories"" were actually defeats when the British under John, Duke of Marlborough, got into the act!

Poussin fled to Rome in the 17th century to work exclusively for *haute* bourgeois and minor nobility, creating French art from nothing.

Marie probably knew nothing of Poussin.

To represent the French revolution as pure offstage destruction like the sea monster in Racine's Phedre is to entrap the audience in an American ideology of hegemony, which in Bush's foreign policy has stunningly lowered my country's moral authority by admitting no outside to the American ""dream"", a ""dream"" that most Americans themselves can no longer afford!

Don't waste your money! Watch La Nuit de Varennes, watch Wazjda's incomparable Danton, watch the classic silent film Napoleon by Abel Gance if that cute history teacher wants you to learn a thing or two about the French revolution before you get knocked up in back of the Steak and Shake, girlfriend.

La Nuit de Varennes stars the incomparable Hannah Schygulla as an Antoinette clone of the minor nobility who Sphinxlike knows the jig is up, and Harvey Keitel as Tom Paine.

In LNDV, Marie Antoinette is a shoe which stamps petulantly in the floor of an inn on The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. You must know, darling, American Woman, that this is the opinion of the sort of people who make this film of the sort of people like you and me babe who buy DVDs.

About the only good part in this movie is a true star turn by Louis XV's mistress, the scandalous and hot Madame du Barry. When sent to the knackers, she glares backward at the palace with a look that scorns not only the Rococo but also this postmodern American rococo piece of utter nonsense.

But all she is is someone's psycho Mom from the 1960s.

Just then Tom Paine, himself,
Came running from across the field,
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield.
And as she was letting go her grip,
Up Tom Paine did run,
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

1579983,1,B00005JPAS,"Sofia Coppola proves conclusively that the apple can fall miles from the tree in this hit-and-miss period drama. While the costumes are lavish and the locations beautiful, the movie is boring at best, irritating at worst. Attempting a cutting-edge approach with completely inappropriate punk rock music as the backdrop of the movie, it rambles on for 2 hours without ever coming close to engaging the viewer in the real drama and difficulty that Marie-Antoinette faced. The socio-political climate is not at all accented, leaving someone who has no prior historical knowledge of the era and the main character guessing as to what exactly the whole deal with Marie-Antoinette is. The worst offense of the movie is that it peters off with an unexciting ending and the complete absence of the decapitation of Marie-Antoinette, which is one of the main reasons she was and remained somewhat infamous throughout history.

This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating - it's not worth anything at all. I hope Sofia Coppola has other hidden talents - clearly film-making is NOT one of them.",1174089600,8,1086,5.033333333333333

The shots are beautiful, especially since it was filmed on location at the real Versailles Palace, which adds to the overall film experience. I was there last year and they did a wonderful job portraying what it was really like to be in the French court and live at Versailles.

Historically, the portrayal of Marie Antoinette is not completely inaccurate, however if you're looking for a historical film, this isn't it. History is biased anyway.

This film is meant to be light-hearted in the sense that it does not include any illustrations of Marie Antoinette imprisoned. It attempts to show the human side of her story, which often history disregards. It makes people see what she may have been feeling at the time, and Sophia Coppala is noted to have mentioned that in a few interviews regarding the film as well. There is also some humour in the film as well, but it's not in your face.

So much detail, thought, & imagination were put into this film--you can't help but appreciate its quality. I think Sophia Coppola hit the nail on the head with the writing, her direction, & so many other subtle nuances such as lighting-- those things that we don't automatically call to mind, but if it all falls into place, the seasoned movie buff can appreciate entirely.

To be honest, I'm not the biggest Sophia Coppola fan. I think Lost in Translation had its moments, but overall, I think Coppola is a bit overrated (& pretentious but that's just my take!) if not riding a little of her famous father's coattails. However, if you want to just be completely sucked into a completely different time (although, perhaps not all that different given today's hedonistic, instant gratification culture), you will likely enjoy Marie Antoinette. During this film, I kept thinking that EACH and EVERY frame was like a beautiful photograph. Again, the clothing was AMAZING and gorgeous (clearly deserving of its Academy Award). Perhaps this film version is not EXACTLY as it were with the real Marie Antoinette. I'm sure Antoinette historians will point out discrepancies, but I think most people would be hard-pressed not to appreciate the sheer beauty of this movie. I watched it three times in a row, I was so impressed & taken by this world of French, Victorian-era, indulgent, gratuitous (yet likely realistic)royalty.

If you want to completely want to escape your own reality for two hours, you will not be disappointed by this movie. I think this is Coppola's pinnacle and Dunst is impressive as well.

1579988,3,B00005JPAS,"I was very, very hesitant about seeing this film, especially after I had started hearing the buzz that it was a sort of punk rock look at history. Not exactly my sort of thing. To balance it, I also heard that it would be mostly based on Antonia Fraser's excellent biography, Marie Antoinette: The Journey, a book that I had enjoyed very much. So, I compromised and waited for the dvd release to watch it.

The film opens as a fourteen year old Archduchess Antoine (Kirsten Dunst) is informed by her formidable mother, the Empress of Austria (Marianne Faithful) that she will be making a marriage alliance to none other than the Dauphin of France, Louis. It will be to the glory of both nations, and young Antoine will be able to help Austria's position in the French court, especially after she becomes Queen of France when old King Louis XV (Rip Torn) dies. Full of excitment -- not the least of which is escaping her mother's scrutiny -- Antoine leaves Vienna and her past behind to endure the rituals that will make her the future Queen.

But Marie Antoinette, as she is newly christened by the French, finds out that wanting is not nearly the same as having. She must dress French, speak French, and even her dogs and ladies will be French. Her husband, Louis, is barely older than she, shy and awkward, and his only interest is in locksmithing and hunting. Soon enough, there are whispers and gossip that Antoinette is frigid, infertile, that the marriage is unconsummated, and that her own position in France is percarious at best. Louis (Jason Schwartzman) tries to be a good husband, and is clearly interested in his bride, but something is clearly wrong. The old king dies, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette become the monarchs, but there still is not an heir and it's not until Antoinette's brother the Emperor (Danny Huston) arrives for a friendly visit does anything get resolved in that direction.

In the meantime, Antoinette indulges in fashion, shopping, gambling and anything she can to soothe the disappointment of having an inept husband, and a court that still sees her as an outsider. Trapped in the rigid heirarchy and etiquette of Versailles, Antoinette struggles along, finding momentary respite from dulling routine by whooping it up with her friends Lamballe and Polignac, and when the dashing figure of Count Axel Fersen (Jamie Dornan) appears, she is more than prepared to fall in love.

By now, Louis and Antoinette have managed to get things to work in bed, and they have a pretty young daughter, with two more babies to follow. This gives Antoinette some security, and to be fear of the spectre of being returned to Austria.  But trouble is arising in France, first with crop failures, and the extravagance of the Court, and the French support of the American Revolution against the English. Soon, the Queen is being whispered of as Queen Deficet and blamed for the fact there is famine.

Once again we get the infamous ""Let them eat cake!"" line, along with gossip of Antoinette having lesbian lovers among her ladies. Yes, it's told for a laugh, but I would love to see a film that didn't use it.

Finally, the people have had enough, the Bastille is attacked by the mob, and the mob turns on the King and Queen at Versaille. The last we see of them is riding away from the gand chateau, bound for imprisonment and eventual dates with the guillotine in Paris.

And that's it. Nothing about the flight to Varennes with Fersen's help, nothing about the war that started to restore Louis and Antoinette to the throne, nothing about the Queen's bravery in captivity and her spirited defense when she was put on trial for her life. It all just simply -- ends.

To say that the ending feels awkward is an understatement. All that I can figure is that the director, Sophia Coppola, was running out of time, and decided that she was bored with the project after Versailles and decided to leave the audience dangling.

And now, for the music. The soundtrack is a rather interesting compliment for the film. The use of punk music, especially in the party scenes is a touch that actually worked, much to my surprise.

Other plus points for the film are the art direction and costume designs, which are spot on, showing the over the top extravagance and decadence of the period, and the fact that the film is actually shot in and around Versailles -- can't beat that for a location on French monarchy! Even the food and flowers are given an artistic touch -- I don't recommend this film if you have a sweet tooth, you will be ravenous by the end.

But there are problems, and a few serious ones at that. One sequence of shoe shopping -- they are Manolo Blahnik?s, by the way -- there is a glaring shot of a modern pair of sneakers. This anachronism blew the film for me, and I found it stupid and pretentious of the director. The other big problem was having the affair between Fersen and Antoinette being consummated physically -- while I'm certain that they were in love with each other, I doubt that she would have gone so far as to commit adultery, given how religious she was, and she was rather prudish.

Two casting moves didn't quite feel right. Rip Torn being cast as Louis XV, aging, raddled and saddled with his mistress, du Barry, just did not do it for me as a decadent, pleasure loving, indolent king. That American ripsaw accent appearing every time he opened his mouth was annoying as hell. Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI didn't feel too right either -- while he's able to play the part with a befuddled look, looking at any portrait of the actual king shows a portly, languid man who's more interested in the dinner table than anything else.

What threw me most of all were the very modern accents and use of modern slang such as ""wow"" and ""okay."" The accents are pure modern Californian American, and the squeaky drawls and screeching from the female actors again shattered any illusion that I had that I was in the eighteenth century.

Yes, I know this was Sophia Coppola's vision of Marie Antoinette. But it's a glaring, jarring and at times, annoying look that will be certainly dated in about a decade or so. The version of the Queen's life with Norma Shearer in the title role is still the best -- and still watchable decades later.

The DVD has England and French language tracks and subtitles, two deleted scenes, various trailers, previews for other films, a 'making of' featurette that helps to explain some of the odd turns that this film made, and a very silly short that has Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI acting like a modern MTV star showing the viewer around Versailles in a send up of 'Louis XVI's Crib.' Very funny to watch, but it also catches the atmosphere of the film. While it's not done deadly serious, the fluff factor overall is at times overwhelming and a bit off-putting.

Overall, this gets only a three star rating, and I wouldn't recommend it save as a curiosity. Go elsewhere for a more complete view of the Queen.

I cannot blame Kirsten Dunst for this -she certainly acted her part well.  The costumes, sets, and her acting are the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.

I should also mention that as a rule I LOATHE period films that utilize rock/pop/current music in the film.  What made it even worse in this case is that it bounced back and forth between Rock that felt very out of synch and Classical that actually added to the depth of the film.  The result was audio whiplash.

1579990,2,B00005JPAS,"Every scene, if not every frame of Marie Antoinette is beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. The sets, the costumes, the FOOD. Everything. It's a demonstration of what big movies should strive to provide. Everywhere you turn there's more amazing costumes, hair, and backdrops for the story to play out on.

The problem is that there's hardly any story to play out. Amidst all the decadent, eye-popping design the story falls entirely flat. Actually falling would imply that it was moving and then stumbled. This story decides never to stand up. Over half of the movie is dedicated to the ""oh-so-depressing"" storyline that poor Marie can't consumate her marriage with her husband. Over and over we see Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman in bed, unable to... to what? If we're supposed to be shown how bored Dunst's Antoinette is, believe me, we've got it.

The idea of the movie seems to involve exploring the self-indulgent lifestyle of the queen of France, while also painting her as a real human who's had such a ""tough"" life because her husband won't sleep with her and she had to leave her homeland of Vienna. In examining this queen, however, the entire film comes off as hopelessly self-indulgent.

Marie Antoinette feels like a posh joke played on an unsuspecting audience. Although, just from the cover, you've got to be suspecting something. The cast features a mixture of British and American actors. So, some of the ""french"" characters and some of the ""austrian"" characters have American accents and some have British accents. Molly Shannon is thrown in for good measure, along with Rip Torn as the King of France. If that doesn't tip audiences off that something is wrong, what will? Jason Schwartzman, who's usually a delight to watch, is entirely miscast, unless miscasting is the idea of ALL the casting, in which case Sofia Copolla cast her film perfectly... making sure that nothing would actually make sense, and no one would actually look like they belonged.

Overall, this film is a waste of $40 million, unless you want to hang your television on the wall, put this movie in, mute it, put on some good music, and host a party. Then I could see how the eye candy might be worthwhile. But as far as a story-line or anything that is comprehensible or enjoyable, look somewhere else.

The extras on the DVD are mostly typical: trailers, trailer for Marie Antoinette, and a pretentious ""making of"" featurette, where we get to hear about how amazing Sofia Copolla's adaptation is (including Francis Ford Copolla, PRODUCER, saying that the more personalized Sofia made it, the better it would be). The one cool bonus on the DVD is the short ""Cribs with Louis XVI"", where Jason Schwartzman is walking through the palace in semi-character describing his crib to MTV. Slight hilarity ensues.

So, if I haven't made it clear enough, this movie is like a runway model: Beautiful, Self-Centered, and Boring.",1173916800,4,2911,4.930612244897959
1579991,1,B00005JPAS,"I love reading positive reviews for totally dull films such as this. People write for hours about its ""look"" and how other people, people who dare to see it for what it is; dull and long, are ""not getting it"". Classic phrases that should tell you what this film is.

I watched it last week with my teenage daughters who wanted to see it because it had Dunst in and used modern music in a history setting. Ok I thought, not a bad start. So I sat down knowing only this about it.

First the positive. It looks great and the sets are fantastic. Big whoop. Ok this is fine and great, if they were part of a story that went somewhere. But it doesnt.

Over an hour in, we were still waiting for something to happen. The whole film seems to initially hinge on her producing an heir to the throne. Gradually over what seems three days of watching you suddenly understand that IS the film. I lost count of how many lifeless parties followed by failed consumations we saw cycled. Yes we got it first time, no need to show it repetitively for the 100th.

There is very little dialogue, certainly at the start. We found ourselves looking at each other asking whether anything was going to happen. My wife tried the volume control a couple of times.

The interesting bit, ie the revolution is dealt with in about the last 3 minutes. And you see nothing, presumably all the cash went on the sets and nothing was left over for a scriptwriter or extras.

Very very dull. You have been warned. Im sure people will say that I didn't get ""it"". And its a beautiful ode to history and the rebirth of a womans etc etc. Or somesuch bull****. Its dull, trust me.

I don't buy the line that some peddle here that it is a women's film. Women hate dull as much as men!

It all became clear when the credits, thank god, rolled. ""Directed by Sofia Coppolla"". Yes, the one who directed that other empty borefest Lost In Translation.

1580032,5,B00005JPAS,"In a dark age of grunge and hype and cynicism and lazy greed, only Sophia Coppola had the daring and faith and courage to actually attempt to create something of pure beauty and grace. Marie Antoinette is an epic achievement in cinematic aesthetics and artistry which also turns out to be a compelling, well-acted story of the tragic, beautiful Austrian girl who became a French immortal. I saw Marie Antoinette at The 2006 New York Film Festival world premiere which Sophia and Kirsten Dunst attended. As they entered Alice Tully Hall and a billion flashbulbs exploded, we began to applaud these glittering stars who strove for impossible perfection, and managed to pull it off. After the film, during the audience questions, I complimented Sophia on being practically the lone filmmaker today with the courage and belief to try to make things which are really beautiful. It's shocking how few filmmakers do that anymore. Do we really need another filmmaker to set a new record for over-the-top special effects, or amount paid to superstars, or the record for movie advertising budgets, or trying to be the biggest opening weekend grosser in history? How gross! Is that what filmmaking and Hollywood are supposed to be about?? NO! Film is the domain of divine Beauty and Perfection. It is now time for a new cinematic renaissance where filmmaking ARTISTS reclaim their mandate to create fantasies and dramas and stories and tales which strive for perfection, genius, devastating beauty and legendary immortality, where the writing and production efforts dwarf trivial things like fx and big names. Sophia Coppola, and the few filmmakers like her, none other of whom can even come to my mind easily, has taken the first step by daringly attempting the nearly impossible: Making a film which has the nerve to emulate classic masterpieces of sublimity like Chinatown, The Shining, The Magnificent Ambersons, Ed Wood, Valmont, films of such beauty that to hope to achieve something similar is only like praying for miracles. But you can't achieve anything if you don't believe in it and try, and Sophia had the guts to attempt High Art while her colleagues in Follywood only keep attempting to make gobs of money. As the eternal truth goes, quality is always better and than quantity, and things of enduring value and worth end up paying handsomely for themselves in the end. Under the tutelage of her brilliant father Francis, auteur and overseer of such masterworks as Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Godfather saga, and The Black Stallion, Sophia has now taken up her family's banner and is herself worthy of knighthood. She has made the leap of faith, she has forged the gold of her spirit in the fire, she has Lived the Fantasy. It takes courage to make something beautiful, and only the courageous become the immortal. People who scorn and ridicule the brave only reveal their own sad mediocrity. Sophia Coppola is now an immortal because she was brave enough to dare to create immortal beauty. This movie is a masterpiece!",1173744000,,3021,4.972332015810276

I favor the 1938 version of Marie Antoinette with Norma Shearer. Being B/W, you can only imagine how grand the sets and costumes must have actually appeared, in addition, the story and ""scandals"" that involved Marie Antoinette were precisely executed. The 1938 version really laid out the highlighted history of the ill-fated French Queen. In addition, the final scenes of the 1938 version were really heart-wrenching and could really tug at your heart strings. Between the two versions, the 1938 version with Norma Shearer wins hands-down.

I fast forwarded through much of it.  What were they thinking when they put that horrific music into it? It was jarring and so inappropriate.  There was no acting to speak of, no script I guess.  There were times when we waited for something to develop, but nothing ever did.  And I don't want to look at anything sweet for the predictable future.  At one point I really expected Marie--all of them, actually-- to fall down sick with sugar poisoning.

1580038,2,B00005JPAS,"I saw Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" last night, accompanied by a friend and some good wine and cheese. It was the only way to make it through a film which was nearly unwatchable for me. My friend, who lived in France for ten years, shared my opinion that it had no plot and no screenplay. I was ready to be annoyed by the historical inaccuracies (which were legion) but on the whole was expecting an edgy, irreverent, slightly burlesque version of Marie-Antoinette's life. However, the film only generated laughter at the depths of banality into which it hastily plunged.

Let me interrupt myself to say to those who did enjoy the movie that I understand why you liked it. In spite of the sometimes bizarre cinematography, Versailles, the gardens, the Petit Trianon were captured in all their splendor. The star of the film was really the Sun King, Louis XIV, the one responsible for such grandeur. The birds singing in the background were a lovely touch as well. Also, the growing tenderness between Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, although it could have been developed more, was sweetly endearing. The last scene, when they are being carted off to their doom and Louis (Jason Schwartzman) looks at Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and she bravely smiles at him in return, was worth the price of the DVD.

I think that what made the film compelling for many was the snippets taken from actual letters and conversations, for the real life of Marie-Antoinette is the stuff of legend; there is magic in her very name. The places where she lived are imbued with a mystery of sorrow and enchantment.

Anyone who does a historical piece, be it a novel or film, knows that what makes it authentic is the consistent attention to details. It is the little historical fine points that bring the past to life. Otherwise, why bother with history? Why go to so much work over period costumes and then have people do and say things that are totally out of character for the era? Sometimes people would bow and curtsy as the princess walked by, and other times they would not. The impression I got was of sloppy direction and sheer indifference to the atmosphere of eighteenth century France.

The scenes of the Fersen affair were a bizarre intrusion into what little story line existed. It did not make sense to show Antoinette having sex with Fersen when she was finally happy with her husband and baby. The affair had no passion, no sensuality, no romance.

Why was Antoinette always shown lolling around? The queen was a busy lady. Even in her leisure she would be occupied with needlework. She embroidered much of the upholstery in her rooms. It almost made me fall asleep to see her prone on the grass all the time.

It is a shame. There were many accomplished actors involved in the production, if only they had been given a screenplay. If only they had had some direction, and a diction coach to mainstream the accents. The varying accents, as well as the rock music, were among the most jarring and distracting elements of the film. The music alone was enough to make me want to turn it off, as well as the constant gorging on sweets. I have never seen such an obscene display of pastries.

1580039,3,B00005JPAS,"Cultural fashions come and go. Apparently, of late, there has been a resurgence of interest in the life of Marie Antoinette, late of Austria and Queen of France during the period of the great French Revolution that began in 1789. Although you would not know that revolution was in the air from this film since it is very tightly focused on the alleged trials and tribulations of being a teenager, fodder in the dynastic politics of the period and unsuccessfully maturing in the late 1700's. And it is also a quasi-feminist attempt to bring Marie into the `sisterhood' of modern feminism. Someone once said that revolutionary periods create conditions where the old society can no longer rule in the old way (although they sure as hell try) and produce leaders particularly ill-suited to the tasks of the times. That is certainly the case here. Ms. Coppola's attempt to create some retroactive sympathy for the character of not so sweet Marie simply does not work.

Curious looks, sneers, whispering...all the elements of classic teen judgment.  Madame du Barrie was the popular slutty girl the football captain (King Louis XV) was dating and the rest of the court was the popular crowd Marie Antoinette was forced into by circumstance.

1580097,2,B00005JPAS,"I held off on seeing this in theaters because the trailer failed to impress me and I'd heard negative things about it. After finally seeing it I won't say that there's no good in it.  It's a visually stunning film with gorgeous shots of Versailles and  costumes that totally deserved the Oscar that they won. I also like the concept: 18th century Versailles as a conemporary teen drama (complete with sex, drugs and rock n' roll) has some intersting parallels and if they were explored this would have been a much better film.  But why does Hollywood persist in thinking that movie goers not only are completely ignorant of history but also are completely incapable of common sense?

The film argues that Marie Antoinette was naive about the political situation of France but basically good hearted. This argument is made in several scenes where we see Marie taking joy in nature, being an attentive mother, and having her feelings hurt in order to evoke the viewers sympathy. Unfortunatley there's too much happening to undermine that depiction.  The film  portrays the 14 year old Marie being taken to France as a child, innocent and unused to the rivalries and dramas of court. It forgets that Marie was raised in the Austrian court and was bred on court politics and taught what was expected of her from childhood. There's no way she would have gone to France that clueless. Furthermore the film undermines the case that it was naivite that caused Marie to ignore the suffering of her subjects as opposed to insensativity or decadence by having several scenes where Marie is exposed, in some way or another to the realities of her world. At one point a letter regarding the situation on Poland is read to her as she picks out dresses. She ignores the letter and then asks the reader if her prefers her sleeves with or without ruffles. Later in the film we see her reading Rousseau and discussing The Marriage of Figaro, both of which were controversial on a literary basis because they undermined aristocratic authority. Marie has no conception of them beyond that they're pretty.  In other words we see her exposed to the politics and culture that led to the revoution but merely ignoring them in favor of champagne, shoes, and hairdos. We see in one scene she wants oak trees brought in to line a walk way. At the same time she's ordering them she's told that she's overspent seriously and that she has no money to give to her charities. Marie considers for a moment, tells her servant to ""order the small oaks"" and she'll ask her husband for the charity money. When a newspaper charges her with the ""let them eat cake"" line  she acts offended claiming ""I would never say that"". Interesting since she's been depicted as exactly the kind of person who would say that! The item thrown in with other newspaper gossip about Marie's sex life implying that she was sort of an 18th Century Paris Hilton.  Exactly. That's the problem. Either she is a rich party girl, ignorant by choice, or she's someone else that the movie doesn't portray. But if she is a rich twit why are we expected to like her?

 The pacing alternately brushes over important events and lingers lovingly on montages of Marie partying her life away and images of shoes and cakes. I'm very curious as to why actors like Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Marianne Faithfull, Rose Byrne, and Rip Torn were hired and then given nothing to do as this is essentially the Kirsten Dunst Show.  Another mental question mark arises when I consider that fact that Kirsten Dunst has been acting since she was a small child (according to IMDb she started acting at the age of 3) and seems never to improve or display any skill. She puts on happy faces and sad faces which look remarkably similar (in this film I found it diffucult to tell if she was laughing or crying in a particular scene) but her interpretation of roles is always a variation on the same thing. She seems to say ""Isn't it fun to be beautiful and popular? Oh...wait...I'm sad!"" in Marie Antoinette as well as  roles from Bring it On to The Virgin Suicides to the Spiderman films.

Maybe I'm being too harsh on this film. As I said earlier, as a film it has its strengths, which are primarily visual. But ultimately I'm left frustrated. There was a good movie in here somewhere but Sofia Coppola was either reluctant or incapable of letting it come through.",1173139200,4,4379,4.662775616083009
1580098,4,B00005JPAS,"When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it was a Baz Luhrman movie. But then I found it was a Sofia Coppola movie. Not a big fan of this chick. Let me be honest. The Virgin Suicides was interesting, but disturbing and not all there. Lost in Translation was just that: lost in translation. But Marie Antoinette manages to deliver. Kinda. The movie's not as fast paced, not as colorful, not as musical, as you may think. The use of modern music, a la A Knight's Tale, is cool, but way under-used. I say that if you're going to do something modern with a period piece, you might as well go all out. The movie teeters between being flashy and cool and boring and dramatic. It never quite decides what it wants to be. And that's really my only beef with this flick. Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman are awesome. The costumes are amazing. And the story is involved, detailed, informative, and interesting.

The movie centers around the marriage of Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Queen of Austria, to the French dauphin. Everyone's counting on her to produce an heir to the throne, but she and her husband aren't even sleeping together. They haven't even consummated the marriage. Every morning, there's a huge rigamoroll involving the entire court just to get Marie dressed. Then everyone watches as she eats. You can see on her face that she hates the hoity-toity customs, but she lives with it anyway. It really is a blow by blow of this chicks life, and one thing after another happens. Rent it. Enjoy it.

(Ecclesiastes 10:19; JPS Tanakh)  Having worked at two small private schools and been a part of other non-profit organizations, I've found that dealing with money on a regular basis can be a truly daunting task.  No matter how secure and established a group's vision, program, and/or five-year plan might be, if they money's not there, nothing will ever get done (outside of scratching and scrambling for just enough money to keep the lights on and the merest of bills paid).  Conversely, when a corporation of any orientation (religious, business, governmental, or otherwise) has in its hands a great deal of money, the results can bring great benefit, great damage, or, sometimes, great apathy.

Admittedly, meeting together with a group of people to decide what would be the best allocation of a group or institution's resources sounds boring to mostly people; however, through my eyes, budgets are truly the way & means by which one can figure out someone else's priorities.  Do you want to know just what's most important to people?  Just take a look into where and how they've spent their money, whether it's been a little or a lot of it.  Ah, budgets...  You're ignored by some and exploited by others; no wonder people never really understand you.

Thus, I would imagine that Sofia Coppola might have chosen Marie Antoinette as the subject for her newest film for that very reason - no one really has ever understood her, for many of the same reasons that budgets don't have many friends.  Let's engage in some comparisons: both budgets & Marie have been accused for the downfall of countries; both budgets & Marie been lambasted by the whims and opinions of the general populace; both budgets & Marie have been blamed for the downfall of national morality; and both budgets & Marie have been misinterpreted by historians for centuries.  It's quite uncanny actually - an actual historical figure and an economic abstraction that controls fiscal reality having so much in common, even down to how both the intellectual elites and commoners have developed such vast theories concerning their impact and importance.  But thankfully, Marie is much more interesting than any budget could ever dream of being.

Sadly though, as a movie, Marie Antoinette isn't nearly as fascinating and captivating as it could have been, much less as intriguing as the historical Marie Antoinette was.  There are many bright spots throughout the film, enough where you want to keep watching to see what happens next, but the time lag in between the viewable scenes came to be almost interminable.  The movie was too long (by about 20 minutes), the overt focus upon Marie's budgetary whims & license became tiring (how many pairs of shoes do we have to see her buying?), and, as palatable & friendly as Ms. Coppola might want Marie to be, I don't think that she had to turn her into a silly, young thing at every possible turn (why do I get the feeling that Marie wasn't the flighty teenager she's too often portrayed to be?).  At times, I felt like I was on sensory overload - I felt burdened down with the expectations of what was supposed to be present in this film and engulfed by a flood of thoughts like, ""There's just too much going on here!""

That's not to say that I didn't enjoy watching the movie, as there are many reasons I would give for people to go out and view the film in the theater.  The acting in the movie is quite proficient across the board, with Jason Schwartzman turning in a phenomenal performance as the socially- & sexually-awkward Louis XVI, and Kirsten Dunst portraying the multi-faceted main character (read: Ms. Coppola tried to have the viewer see Marie through way too many lenses) with remarkable grace and depth.  The budget for this film must have been rather hefty (especially for what's more aptly described as an ensemble cast), because the opulent & lavish combinations of scenery, shoes, dresses, hair, and accessories were astonishingly beautiful and were so throughout the film.  And the soundtrack was outstanding - Ms. Coppola has developed a knack for choosing songs that speak ably for the characters.

Moreover, Marie Antoinette effectively depicts the gamut of intense societal juxtapositions and contradictions that the main character ran through early & often in her life as the Dauphine and then Queen of France.  Look at it this way - she was a foreign-born girl who was married away at just 15, became Queen at 19, perpetually pressured to produce a male heir (the only kinds of children who count in monarchal societies), was the focus of nasty rumor mills, and was seen as the literal & figurative reason for France's woes.  In the end, the viewer finds out that they don't mind being just a bit sympathetic towards the Queen - even with all of the money she obviously spent on shoes, clothes, Versailles dcor, and similar things, it's quite difficult to place all of France's economic & sociopolitical woes onto one woman's shoulders.

Nevertheless, the movie feels weighed down by the magnitude & scope of its implied purpose - it's quite difficult to explain in a two-hour movie just why one can't place all of France's economic & sociopolitical woes onto Marie's shoulders.  It's an admirable attempt, but I came away from the theater feeling like I'd just watched an excellent & well-produced bit of historical hagiography.  Can a two-hour movie, based upon a recently-released & historically-based biographical novel, really dispel the public opinion (French or otherwise) that swells against Queen Marie?  Can putting a beautiful actress's face to the story of the French Revolution really be a credible piece of anti-history?  And, if we're supposed to feel sorry for Marie in the face of the coming Revolution, why do we only see her face the thronging masses for mere seconds?  Other issues I had with the film: the timeline is too heavily focused upon Marie's first few years in France; there is this strange maternal segue that has Marie, her children, and her mistresses living an idyllic & detached existence in the French countryside (do we really need to see these aristocrats reading Rousseau?); and the lead-up to the Revolution (which we never really see) is quite hurried & forced.  Thus, even without delving into the historical inaccuracies present in the film, Marie Antoinette just feels too clumsy & unwieldy in its sympathetic depiction of the woman's life.

So, here's the question - was Ms. Coppola so focused on finding room in the budget for specially-designed Manolo Blahnik shoes for Marie & her mistresses that she neglected to spend more time in the editing room?  Is this all simply a case that Ms. Coppola simply tried too hard with this picture and was overwhelmed by the potential of what might have been? Now, admittedly, one of the cardinal sins of reviewing is to use the word ""potential,"" because the word typically is surrounded by an extremely negative connotation and is used to ward people away from the stench of the product being reviewed.  Cries of ""Potential!"" can plague and doom a movie or album release because people enter the experience with such a heightened level of expectation, only to be let down rather harshly by what they see or hear.  I wish that more attention had been paid to the ebb & flow of the scene changes - sudden shifts & quirky transitions worked wonders in days-long timeline of Lost In Translation, but are cause for confusion in the decades-long timeline of Marie Antoinette.

Hence, I feel torn with this movie.  Did I like it?  Yes.  Would I see it again?  Yes.  Were there many things I thought were out-of-place and peculiar?  Yes.  Do I think that this film could have been better than it was?  Yes.  Do I think that some themes & concepts felt more-than-a-bit forced?  Yes.  But do I think you should go see it?  Absolutely - just be prepared to scratch your head in wonder on more than one occasion.",1173139200,,8338,4.838028169014085
1580100,4,B00005JPAS,"Sofia Coppola's version of Marie Antoinette focuses on the grandeur and opulence of Versailles, the strained relationship between Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the repurcussions that their youth and wild ways had on the future of their country. When Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI meet they are mere children who know nothing about one another. For more than a year of their marriage they are virtual strangers who sleep in the same bed, but have yet to consummate their marriage. Louis is portrayed as a distant husband who cares more about his hunting and lock-making than the future of his country. Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a confused, spendthrift who attempts to mend the rift in her marriage by indulging in court gossip, stuffing herself with sweets, and spending copious amounts of money.

As a whole, I enjoyed the film. I thought Kirsten Dunst was better than I've ever seen her (though I will allow that comparing this performance to Bring It On and Spiderman is a bit of a stretch) and the costumes, lighting, and direction were superb. I've never been a big fan of historical movies that are retold to suit the writers' purposes, but in this instance I was willing to look past it and just see that this was a well-made film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, however, that the soundtrack left something to be desired. Although I do like a lot of the songs that were used in this movie, most of the time they seemed discordant with what was happening on screen. Still, as a whole this movie was entertaining and I think that's what's most important.",1172966400,,1586,4.705035971223022

It was painfully dull, the only reason I didn't walk out on this movie is because I went to see it with a friend and she kept hoping it would get better...it didn't.  All three of us were extremly dissapointed in the movie.  Sophia never let her audience get to know or care about Marie and because of that lack of conection her death scene wasn't that moving.  The affair she had was hinted at by her looking out the window and staring romantically at a guy on a horse.  This movie had so much potential to be great but Sophia destroyed it by focusing on the clothes and not on the charecters.  There was no substance or depth to any of her charecters.  They were one demensional, uninteresting and flat.  Shame on you Sophia.",1172966400,6,893,4.331325301204819

The costumes and sets were sumptuous and beautiful to look at and Kirsten Dunst, with the meager 'nothing' script she was given to work with, did a brilliant job.... However, the distracting 'modern' music was just horrid and detracted from the movie in a BIG way.... Also, I don't know that I've ever watched a movie with such a 'non-existant' script? Kirsten Dunst did such a good job with the small amount she was given that it gave me a reinforced appriciation for her acting skills. As a whole though, very disappointing, 'cause they could've done so much with it, given the beautiful scenery and costumes and main actress...  So, there is my 2cents on the movie... OH....

There is no mockery of Marie Antoinette nor Louis, but rather, a considerate and detailed look at daily life in the court at Versailles. The etiquette, the society, the distractions or lack of. Kirsten Dunst communicates a broad range of emotions and should have been nominated for an Oscar for her performance of MA, taking her from an innocent girl to queen of France and mother, in turns proud and bereaved. She speaks so much with her eyes. The details are astounding, with such lavish sets (the flowers! The macarons!) and costumes, and the soundtrack is fun and puts an approachable spin on history. The friends dancing at the masked ball to Souxie & the Banshees, for example. It's fun! Or the sexy love scenes between Marie and her Swedish uniformed lover to the pounding drumbeats of Adam and the Ants (now that is funny!). I especially loved the parts filmed at Hameau, where MA and her beautiful daughter relish in nature and the simple pleasures of the village. All my life I'd heard the rumors of MA dressing as a milk maid and cavorting at Hameau as if she were a perverted spoiled neurotic. I appreciate seeing a completely different side of the story, told with respect and seriousness.

And OK, the sets were stunning, and the very likeable Kirsten Dunst did bring the character of Marie Antoinette to life.  But there's a little detail called dialogue, which in this case was either absent or incredibly dull, with most of the scenes relying on visuals and music to compensate for the lack of substance.  And, while the film is fairly strong on little personal details, such as Marie Antoinette being forced to leave her dog at the border (although it was not a pug) and enduring the humiliation of giving birth to her first daughter in public, the larger historical context is often ignored or oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy.  It is ironic that the film falls victim to the same hyper-materialism and superficiality of which Marie Antoinette herself was accused.  Ultimately it left me unsatisfied -- like eating three desserts when what you really wanted was an omelette.",1172793600,8,1052,5.022988505747127
1580186,2,B00005JPAS,"After Sofia Coppola's successful films THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION, many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath. Taking on the life of MARIE ANTOINETTE is no small feat, too. Here is someone who's short life and reign as Queen of France ended in head-tumbling fashion, but affected France's government for years to come.

It is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film, causing it to get booed at the Cannes Film Festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office. But many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure.

I'm not going to give you a history lesson, as I'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of Marie Antoinette. But I will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film.

First, expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes. Any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear (perhaps too many) and their excellent designs. Heading from the feet upward, the dresses, wigs, fans, and head-wear are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times. The film was shot on-location in Versailles, so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets.

But from here the production takes a serious nosedive. The screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes (from Louis and Marie eating many silent breakfasts, to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls). The end of Marie's life is run through in slipshod fashion, as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule.

Then, of course, there's the music. Incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before. The one that most comes to mind is A KNIGHT'S TALE. Although not the pinnacle of film success, A Knight's Tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story. But with Marie Antoinette, the connections are distant at best. Can you imagine songs from Bow Wow Wow and The Cure infusing a renaissance-style film? If you're like me, this is a bit hard to swallow.

What happens in the end is we get a movie that is all pomp and no circumstance; visually appealing on almost every level but sorely lacking a decent script that would allow the acting to shine through. I'll give Kirsten Dunst a few claps of applause for her portrayal, as she made the best out of a pretty awful screenplay, but that's about it.

A bit of a snoozer, I'm afraid.",1172793600,4,2481,4.663615560640732

A couple things threw me off with this film, though: the accents we're all over the place (I would expect to hear French-like or austrian-like accents throughout, but instead we get American, French, british, etc.), and the music was odd- I love some of the songs, but do 80s' Europop songs really fit in Roccoco Europe?",1172620800,,459,4.666666666666667
1580189,3,B00005JPAS,"I mean, it's different, it stands out and some of the choices are actually good choices. Movies like 'Romeo + Juliet' (1996), prove that it is possible to use modern aspects in older stories. The idea of Marie Antoinette is not bad, but everything is just halfly done, including Kirsten Dunst's acting. When finally there is a sincere scene for Kirsten, it should be the moment where everyone in the audience starts bawling, but nobody does, cause she won't go for it all the way. Also, there are scenes that take forever and don't seem to have any purpose and when you think it's finally getting interesting, suddenly the end credits show up, out of nowhere.

Now, it's not a horrible movie, I enjoyed the characters and the situations they got themselves in, I watched the whole movie and didn't think it was a waist of my night, that counts for something, right?",1172620800,2,865,4.65359477124183

1580261,4,B00005JPAS,"I watched this film twice over the weekend.  Maybe I had low expectations, but I felt the spirit and tone of this film was very true to life in portraying Marie Antoinette and her intimate circle.

The film is a confection of beautiful costumes and exquisite sets and the acting was refreshingly natural.  Kirsten Dunst gave me a glimpse of what I believe the young Queen was really like.  It's a fact that Marie Antoinette was immature (her own mother noted this in a letter to Louis XV), not particularly analytical or intellectual, fond of creature comforts, and, doubtless, terribly isolated and wary of her unstable position with her frigid husband.

I expected the modern touches (dyed wigs and modern music in the soundtrack) to be jarring.  Instead I found them subtle enough to be harmonious.  The sight of the opulent courtiers flouncing and frisking to hard rock in a masque ball was genuine, the music matches the character of the decadent age.

This film is a work of art and I cannot believe some people disliked it.",1172448000,5,1030,4.747191011235955
1580262,5,B00005JPAS,"I simply don't understand why people believe that this movie was shallow and boring to watch.  Was it the music?  The lush visuals?  I, personally, found it lovely and telling, poignant and memorable.  The movie successfully conveyed the emotional struggle of Marie Antoinette to survive in Versailles.  Of all things, I most acutely felt Marie's frustration towards her frustrations--the frustration of not being allowed to feel (or at least show) frustration.

All the beautiful colors, lush visuals, and pop music created the right scenery for showing the lavishness of the French court.  More importantly, it portrayed the way Marie Antoinette coped--she escaped through diversions.  It's simply a shame that the movie got more press for its musical choices than the movie itself.  (For the record, I think Coppola's choices for the music soundtrack were pitch-perfect for what she was trying to achieve, which was a sense of cutting-edge hipness and coolness.  The feeling simply wouldn't be the same if the music was 'style galant.')

Perhaps the movie was too young to appeal to people who couldn't get over some stylistic choices.  It may simply be that, unfortunately, some critics can't see that ""youthful"" is not the equivalence of ""immaturity.""  I noticed this when, in 2003, the popular artist Jewel released an album that was hip and glossy on the surface, but still poignant and thoughtful on a deeper level--audiences couldn't get over the fact that the form and presentation was not ""acoustic folk chick with a guitar,"" which they equated with seriousness.  Therefore, judgements were made on the form and not the deeper message.  I feel that this is what bit Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette.  The surface form was fresh, youthful, hip, and cool--and that was as far as some people could see.  I usually do not criticize other reviewers, but I must say that I agree with the previous review titled: ""Think it's shallow? Look closer. Your interpretation is what's shallow.""

Coppola's Marie Antoinette is poetry.  Her art is subtle, but still striking, nonetheless, and this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen recently.  I'm kicking myself for believing the critics' reviews of the movie (many of which accused it of being fluff--something I still can't grasp) and not seeing it on the big screen.

However, I really failed to understand the purpose of this movie outside of showing off the fantastical visual feast and beauty of Kristen Dunst. This really isn't a bio-pic on Marie Attoinette. It really doesn't captured the flavor of late 18th century France and the story line goes from one relatively meaningless party scene after another. Jason Schwartman who played hapless Louis XVI, proves equally hapless in a thankless role. Sofia Coppola made very interesting choices but they were choices that will be dated in a few years as today's music in the movie become yesterday's news. That where some of the mistakes of the movie come in was that many of contemporary 21st century concepts were inserted in this movie about a 18th century woman.

Perhaps, the saddest thing about this movie was that it ended just when Marie Antoinette's life was about to get very interesting. Kristen Dunst had a chance to show off her acting bit instead be being so one dimensional carefree, free spending character. Coppola had a chance to create a landmark movie but instead, she choose to make momentary statement movie that sounds dated even now.

The DVD of this movie proves to be well made. The sound are excellent and images proves to be astoundingly well presented.

She did a beautiful job of portraying the story from Marie Antoinette's perspective only, really giving the viewer the understanding of how much of a bubble the royals lived in at that time.

The 80's soundtrack captures quite well the spirit of teenage oblivion as so genuinely portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. That reviewers expect the character of Marie Antoinette to understand its place in history exposes a larger form of historical misunderstanding.

When Ms. Coppola's film doesn't satisfy a modern understanding, based on misperception, is it the fault of the filmmaker or the reviewer? It's as if characters are to act like adults when in fact they are not. It may also be likely that Coppola has given the viewer a more complex vision of a famous historical period.

This movie was totally disjointed, lacking in substance, and less than subtle (the entire movie pretty much completely brooded on whether or not they would ever be able to have sex).  Add that to a scattered and completely unexplainable punk rock soundtrack, and you don't have the winner.  I'm sorry, but this movie just wasn't good.

Filming was also done in the real Palace of Versailles, so it's nice to see they were able to be true to the setting.

1580343,5,B00005JPAS,"I have to admit I came to Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" with a touch of bias. I absolutely loved her previous film ""Lost in Translation"" (it has now become an absolute favorite) and my curiosity was peaked by the high energy trailers for the new film, that anachronistically mixed 18th century images with a '80s punk/pop soundtrack.

Well, I wasn't disapointed. Once again Coppola has produced a wonderful film, that just takes your breath away with both it's beautiful 'in your face' cinematic visual imagery and an emotional character study of a young French Queen, who is primarily remembered by history for her materialistic extravagance and unfortunate end.

Coppola's film (based on Antonia Frasier's biography ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"") takes an impressionistic viewpoint of the young Queen. Marie (Kristin Dunst) is a beautiful, fifteen year old Hungarian princess, brought to the Court of Versailles to marry the equally young, Louis XVI. Her family wants the marriage to secure a Franco-Austrian alliance, while the French want her for one reason only...to produce an heir for the throne. Until she does this, her title and place within the socially/politically vicious French court is on unsound footing.

The film follows Marie's emotional metamorphisis from a shy, lonely teenager to an extravagant young woman, who loves both high fashion and partying. She becomes the 'A' list celebrity of her day. Finally we see Marie become more reflective as a caring wife and mother. But by the time she finds maturity and some emotional closure in her life, the angry mobs of (unseen) peasants are at the palace gates.

Once again Sofia Coppola produces a stunning film. Not unlike ""Lost in Translation"", she transports us to what seems like the caccoon of another world, where we follow the life of a lonely young woman. Everything about this film is brilliant. Kristin Dunst gives a great performance and really is the movie's emotional core. The supporting cast, which includes Jason Shwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis and Molly Shannon are quite good as well. I'm also impressed by the beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes and locations.(Where are the multiple 'Academy Award' nominations?) All these aspects readily contribute to recreating the extravagance of the French Court. It's a visual feast for the eyes!

Finally, I want to mention the vivacious, high energy soundtrack made up of mostly punk/pop songs of the eighties. Some critics have been negative about using this type of music for the film. But I really think it contributes to the portrayle of the boisterous spirit and wild lifestyles of the characters. If Marie Antoinette were alive today, she just might be listening to ""Bow Wow Wow"", while she drank champagne at some debauched party! (Sofia you can make a 'mix tape' for me any day!)

 A great movie! Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next film!",1171929600,5,2904,5.139830508474576
1580344,3,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette is one of history's most (in)famous monarchs. It's not like she did anything special for her people, considering that after her reign, France was faced with many debts to settle. However, she certainly had that je-ne-sais-quoi about her, and so does Sofia Coppola's movie. It is not a perfect movie in any way (it's not even a well-done movie), but it will surely amuse for its two hour length.
Every single shot of ""Marie Antoinette"" is a pleasure to look at, beautiful and full of rich colors. However, this cannot be due to wonderful filmmaking - we're talking about Kirsten Dunst and Versailles. Dunst is gorgeous, and the role suits her perfectly. No matter how many myths have been told about the queen's vanity, and no matter how many shoes Copolla fits into a shot (there is even a pair of blue Converse All-Stars), she rises above these shallow approaches to acting, and makes Marie a vulnerable, observant woman. As for Versailles, the castle is a character of its own, and one of the most important aspects of this movie. As the curtain drops, on her way to the guillotine, Marie Antoinette looks sadly through the window of her carriage onto the wonderful Versailles scenery, the last words are ""I'm saying good-bye"", and so are we.
The problems with this movie are not its stars, the direction, and not even the script. The problem is that it's preposterously egoistical. The first and the last half-hour are interesting-enough, with character development and interesting portrayal of the era. However, there is an hour in between that drags along most boringly. It is such a shame that Copolla blew her chance to make a great movie, and it would've been great. Instead, ""Marie Antoinette"" feels like a Versailles slumber party, hosted by wonderful people, rich and shallow.",1171843200,7,1804,4.898692810457517
1580345,2,B00005JPAS,"Rich color, beautiful lighting and that's about it. Where was the story? Where was the dialog? Mostly modern music peppered throughout this movie to cover up the lack of a story. The cinematography was outstanding, scenic from start to finish, but there was just no story. What little dialog there was could barely be heard over the music much of the time, and often was just snippets of moments in time that really didn't seem to have anything to do with the anything else, I can't say story I failed to find one.

I'm not going to get into all the historical errors, as the movie isn't a historic biopic if it was, it failed splendidly. The story was choppy and the overall acting sub-par to the point it was difficult to follow at times. It's nothing but eye candy and nothing for the brain. If they spent a fraction of what they spent on set design, on a script they might have had something. I think it tried to be ""Knights Tale"" with the modern music and ""Amadeus"" with the rich texture, but lacked the story that those had in spades.

I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. If it wasn't for the color and richness of the cinematography of this movie, I would have likely turned it off. The director and writer of this film is clearly not the quality of their father.",1171843200,7,1291,4.397489539748954
1580346,4,B00005JPAS,"Now that I've seen Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"", I understand the mixed critical reviews. I doubt many people could deny that visually this film is stunning: the costume design, sets and art direction are spectacular. But the 80's soundtrack and languid, dreamy tone are sure to polarize the audience.

For the most part, I thought it all worked. This film portrays Marie Antoinette as a privileged, yet controlled and smothered, teenager. Arranged to marry the prince of France, her political survival depends on her giving birth to an heir. Unfortunately, her awkward husband, for reasons that are never really clear, can't consummate their marriage. So Marie Antoinette blows off steam by enjoying her stilted life the only ways she can: by spending loads of cash, partying nonstop and, eventually, finding some sense of purpose in motherhood.

Kirsten Dunst gives an understated, yet somehow charismatic, performance as the young queen. And although the film probably amounts to more style than substance, it's still well worth watching.",1171843200,2,1047,5.33939393939394

The screenplay for this new version is a disaster and I believe Ms. Coppola (sp?) was off her medication or on a bad acid trip when she directed this and wrote the screenplay.  Kirsten Dunst is miscast - a European actress would probably have been better.  The contemporary music dates this movie and ruins the spirit.  It's a shame that with access to Versailles and a great costume designer that the opportunity to film Marie Antoinette in color was wasted ...

1580349,3,B00005JPAS,"...Eye Candy that is, and like candy, its sweet, but lacking in any real nutritional value.

 At first when seeing previews for this movie, i was disgusted with the whole 80s NewWave take on this historical 18th century figure. 'All that good scenery gone to waste', i thought.

But, i was interested in it, so i looked up some videos to do with it on youtube, and saw some impressive interviews and featuretts. And i got to understand what the director was trying to do.

 So, with that, i decided not to judge it on its 80s music soundtrack and apparently comical movie trailor. I was now actually excited about this movie.

 Since i skipped it in theaters, i waited for it to come on dvd.

 Finally seeing it, i liked the first parts of the movie, some parts were even kinda charming and fun....not to mention all the fancy, colorfull clothing and luxurious living. Lots of champane, lots of juicy rich creme and fruit filled cakes eaten. Lots of delicate sweets and pastries...more champane. And of course parties, with all that i mentioned before.

 I liked how Marie Antoinette gradually learns the ropes of this ""formal"" and ""ceremonial"" and ""ritualistic"" living, early on in the movie.

Her introduction into the whole ""morning rutine"" becomes kinda funny as it gets more and more ""rediculous"", and with each passing day starting with this formality, she becomes more expectant and 'ready' for the day ahead. Stuff like that was fun.

 The gossip and whispering amongst the people of ""rank"" is kinda funny. For instance, when someone burps at the kings table.

 Also, the actress who is from Saturday Night Live...just seeing her again and again through spots in the movie started to make me laugh. Not becouse of what she says, but of the fact that its her and she makes these fake forced smiles. She plays sorta a side-lines gossip...you can liken her character to one of the ugly trash talking girls in highschool.

The movie has really nice sets and costumes. A really nice shot in the film is when marie is on a boat in the lake just slowly sailing by.

Visualy, its like a look into the lives of the rich and privlidged. Youll see what all the 18th century rich kids do day in and day out, since they don't work for a living, theyve gotta do something to keep from boredom...so they party, smoke herb and have premartial sex.

 I guess times haven't changed much...the only thing perhaps different from today as those smashing wigs everyone and their grandma are ""rock'n"", as it were.

 Well, i hope you had some fun reading this. Hope it atleast slightly entertained or helped you make a decision on whether or not you should see or buy this movie.

 The fun in the movie eventually stops though and marie is forced to confront the repacussions of her actions, and non-actions.

If you noticed, i haven't been trying to give any real details away besides visual descriptions, so incase you go and rent it or buy it, you can see scenes for yourself and maybe enjoy them.

The later part of the movie actually begins to show hints of depth and content....but sadly, i felt cut short and left empty at the movies conclusion. Theres so much more to be seen. But the movie fades out and i was left feeling quite dissapointed. ""thats it?""

 Like i said before, this movie will curb your craving for eye candy, but it won't curb your appetite with anything nuturishing. The problem with these visual movies is that we as viewers, believe it or not, aren't just souly visual creatures, we need depth and substance. Its kinda like when a guy gets with some hot chick and enjoys all the ""goodies"", but eventually, he just naturally, cant be with that girl, she doesnt have much of a mind he realises...and it ends up not working out.

Its like that....we get to taste the sweet fruity nectar, but we're still left hungry, cuz we naturally need more than sweets.

This movie isn't a history lesson, i recommend it for people who like 80s music and 18th century fashion.

1580371,3,B00005JPAS,"There is a great disparity of opinion on the '06 release of the film `Marie Antoinette' and it's really not that difficult to see why. Some viewers are more plot and substance driven, while others are more visually oriented. This movie obviously plays to the visuals. The film is cinematically stunning; the French landscape, the set design and the costumes are gorgeous beyond belief. If nothing else, this 2 hour and 3 minute romp through pre-revolutionary France will delight your senses to an array of color, texture and architectural wonder you'll long remember. For that it's worthy of at least 3 Stars.

But what about plot and substance, is there any? The movie plays like a period piece on the lives of the rich and famous, however there are some good moments sprinkled in here and there. There are several charming and whimsical scenes concerning Marie's need to permanently establish her aristocratic standing by becoming pregnant and Louie's hesitation, lack of interest, or inability to consummate the marriage. There is also the presence of the constant, idle chatter amongst the bored, nobly born patrons of the King's Court that helps maintain your interest for awhile as the ill-defined plot lumbers to its eventual conclusion.

Do I recommend this film? Well, if you're into period pieces and stories of Lords and Ladies, or if you're looking for magnificent scenery and sumptuous attire you'll probably enjoy it. If not you should pass on this one.

It's a very visual movie, and you can get most pleasure out of it by just admiring the atmosphere and taking in the soundtrack, which is fantastic. The movie has had bad reviews simply because people are looking to be taught something about Marie Antoinette, and I feel that this is quite ridiculous. If you watch another movie that is set in a different time period, normally you wouldn't expect to learn much about the past. You're just there for the story, which, in this case, is simply about Marie Antoinette the person. Not really the queen, or the legend. This movie is interesting in that it presents the main character as a modern girl trapped in the past. To enjoy it, you can't sit there expecting a history lesson, because you won't get it. You shouldn't even expect that much of a storyline. It's the complex character that makes the movie. It's a movie that requires you to observe. Unfortunately, too many people are used to cheap movies that cram useless storylines down the their impatient throats, so when they have to do it themselves, they get a little restless and confused.

1580376,4,B00005JPAS,"There will probably be no other film this year that will divide its viewers more than Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Coppola has made this years love it or hate it film. This film divided the critics at the Cannes Film Festival and few people even booed it during the screening. Some may find this film to be overly trite but in my opinion Coppola has made a wonderful film. She has captured her historical muse with artistic style and has made a provocative film about being blinded by superficiality.

Everyone who has stayed awake in world history class knows about Marie Antoinette, who has gotten the rap as one of histories biggest ditz. She was known to have said, ""Let them eat cake,"" when asked how to solve France's famine. Antoinette probably really never said it but the line has made her so iconic. Coppola's film looks at the world though the eyes of this girl and concentrates on her life from when she arrives to Versailles from Austria as a girl of 15.  She is greeted at France to a very snooty welcome and goes to become queen of France. In her title of power turns to everything her heart desired. Such as fancy shoes, ridiculous wigs, elaborate gowns and partying till the sun comes up. The script was loosely adapted from an acclaimed biography of Antoinette by Antonia Fraser.

Sofia Coppola truly knows how to capture youth, particularly girlhood. She has masterly captured the dreamy side of teenage girls in The Virgin Suicides. Lost in Translation captured youthful loneliness and resulted in a spiritually moving film. Marie Antoinette feels like Coppola combined her themes of Suicides and Translation and portrays them through Antoinette. She goes for more of a sympatric approach and gives some insight of what kind of woman she was. Ultimately Coppola's general thesis of the character of Marie Antoinette is that she was misunderstood and above all just a girl who wanted to have a little fun.

Kirsten Dunst stars as the title role. I personally have always found this actress to be very charming and she brings just that to the role of the pampered queen. Dunst brings warmth to Antoinette and you are able to find empathy with her.  The supporting cast includes Jason Swartzman as Louis XVI. He comically underplays Louis as being a young man way over his head. Two of the films sauciest performances come from actresses Asia Argento as Madame DuBarry and Rose Bryne as Duchesse de Polignac. These two actresses fit their roles perfectly and are a hoot to watch tear up the place.

 Coppola beautifully captures the theme of superficiality by using the main center piece of the film to her advantage, which is Versailles. The actual palace of Versailles was used in the film and it's superbly captured.  There are extravagant shots of the garden fountains and one particular scene in the Hall of Mirrors, which was opened exclusively for the film. Versailles is used by Coppola to be a fortress protecting its inhabitants from the outside world.

Coppola films her actors in Versailles as if they were a box of candies. Everything feels somewhat sweet and stylized. Antoinette and her pose of duchesses are dressed in their finest and parade around the palace like the 18th century pop stars that they were.

Coppola also does something very interesting in editing the film. She edits many sequences scored with contemporary rock music. During Antoinette's birthday party New Order's Ceremony scores the scene and the result is breathtaking from a cultural perspective by adding a little of the new to the old. The film opens with Gang of Four's song Natural's Not in It. It's in this scene introduced by the new wave rock song when the viewer gets a reminder that this isn't the average period piece.

The films greatest strength is that it captures ignorance beautifully.  Marie was blinded by her own silly life that she had no clue what was going on in the world around her and resulted with her literally getting her head handed to her. Coppola takes the approach to skip over the French Revolution and chooses to show the world through the ignorance of Antoinette. What resulted when I was watching the film was that I as well was seduced by its glamour as well. The outside world didn't exist to its characters and I could see how you could easy get raped up in it. The film ends at the beginning of the climax, when Antoinette's bubble protecting her is burst by an angry mob who has stormed Versailles. Coppola chooses not to show her execution and there is really no need to see it. The climax returns to a much needed reality to the film and leaves the viewer in the same bewilderment as its main characters.",1171670400,3,4658,4.744128553770087
1580377,1,B00005JPAS,"I was anxiously looking forward to this movie, and I was very disappointed. Without going into the strange, varried, and often absent accents or the inaccurate fashions, there were still many things that bothered me about this film. The fact that pop songs were playing during a movie set in the 1700s was something I had already prepared myself for. What I wasn't ready for was the fact that those songs were played loudly and with very awkward timing; they were a distraction rather than a complement. Worse, though, was the fact that there was little to be distracted from. If we weren't listening to her gossip or watching her shop, then we were almost certainly watching her eat. I was also very disappointed by the lack of historical events. The ""affair of the necklace"" was not mentioned at all, nor any other event that led to her downfall. Which brings me to my greatest disappointment - the end. The end of this movie was so abrupt that I almost didn't believe it was actually the end. I was expecting a tragic ending and instead I got... nothing. There was nothing tragic about the Marie Antoinette of this film, except for the time I wasted in anticipation.",1171670400,3,1169,4.6521739130434785
1580378,4,B00005JPAS,"I fell in love with ""Lost in Translation."" It was one of the best movies I'd seen in quite some time.

But a lot of the early stuff I was seeing and hearing about ""Marie Antoinette"" did not seem especially positive. From reviews, I was expecting a film that championed style over substance, and that was going to an apologia for privileged rich girls. I also wasn't terribly thrilled about the casting of Kirsten Dunst, who I generally find a bit too ditzy in her roles.

As a result, I didn't see this in the theatre. When it came to video, I decided to give it a try. And I'm quite glad I did.

All the reviews and advertisements to the contrary, I found this to be a surprisingly deep and cynical film. It wisely avoids trying to make any over-arching commentary on the Revolution as a whole, instead being a very personal look at Marie Antoinette's experiences. And it has a nicely ambiguous approach there - we see a child who has been raised somewhat spoiled, but who also becomes aware of much of the decadence around her, and is clearly very troubled by it. Mostly, it is the portrait of a single person in a role far beyond what could be filled by any one person - she has to be larger than life, and isn't.

Kirsten Dunst's performance was outstanding. Easily the best I've seen from her. This may be the film that turns me into a Kirsten Dunst fan. Jason Schwartzman, too, gives a great performance, giving as a Louis XVI who is both sympathetic and still greatly flawed.

The film fars fall short of the brilliance of Copolla's last film, but it's still very much a worthwhile viewing.

Also of interest - the DVD includes a special feature, done in the style of ""MTV Cribs,"" featuring Louis XVI. Schwartzman is hillarious in this, and it's easily worth the purchase price of the dvd just to see this little bit.",1171670400,3,1824,4.446107784431137
1580379,3,B00005JPAS,"Sofia Coppola has emerged as one of the most talented directors working today, and from a techincal standpoint 'Marie Antoinette' is a dazzling display of her boundless abilities.  Every sumptuous detail of the production is gorgeous: the lighting, the cinematography, the music (which controversially features modern songs to bridge the gap between the past and present), and especially the elaborate costumes and art direction.  I have had the pleasure of visiting Versailles, and Coppola captures every breathtakingly beautiful corner of its (in)famous being -- an especially glorious achievement in that she restores all of its glory to it so that it becomes a vibrant location instead of the ominous museum that it is today.  A lot of hostility has been directed at the soundtrack, but I don't see what the fuss is about.  The songs fit the story perfectly and not the exquisitely painful vice versa that has bogged down Cameron Crowe's recent films, for example.

Where 'Marie Antoinette' loses its focus is in Coppola's screenplay, adapted from Antonia Fraser's alternate take on Antoinette's role in history.  I love what it's going for in that it depicts Louis and, particularly, Marie as youths caught up in the frivolity of their adolescence and totally unprepared to rule a nation in turmoil, but Coppola's script only hints at those themes and doesn't really get them across.  A large part of the film (more than an hour of its two hour running time) is devoted to Marie's precarious situation in her new home when she is unable to consummate her marriage to the curiously disinterested Louis and produce an heir to the throne that would secure her position of prominence in the court.  There is dramatic heft here, no thanks to Kirsten Dunst -- who makes Marie an implacable party girl, with few to no hints at any inner angst in her coiffed head -- but it does little to get those aforementioned themes across.  Louis' disastrous reign over France is instead relegated to the film's final forty-five minutes, making it feel rushed and woefully unexplored.  There is no build-up to the revolution that would claim the lives of Marie and Louis, so that if you had no knowledge of French history from high school you would be hard pressed to understand what the fuss was about.  This is largely due to the determinedly insular world that the film depicts; we rarely get a glimpse of anything going on outside of Versailles, and when we do it is only for the principles to party hard in Paris and steal home in the middle of the night (an otherwise clever allusion on Coppola's part to the club-hopping of today's royalty).  It makes sense if you consider that Marie and Louis were actively trapped in their environment -- literally put on display like the prized animals in a zoo -- but it makes the incredibly dire situation that the majority of France faced at that time frustratingly vague.  Coppola is an amazingly talented director and screenwriter (as evidenced by her previous films, 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Lost in Translation'), but 'Marie Antoinette' only pays tribute to half of those gifts.  It's a marvel of direction and lush staging, but the screenplay is an oddly impenetrable facade that fails to get at the heart of one of history's most electrifying (and controversial) figures.

The DVD's special features are relatively skimpy, but there's a fun (albeit brief) Cribs-style look at Versaille hosted by the affable Jason Schwartzman -- who displays such a great deal of charisma that it makes you respect his restrained portrayal of the dull Louis all the more.",1171670400,8,3595,4.928807947019868

Having missed it in theaters I didn't know what to expect, other then what I heard which was less then flattering. True this film must make historical film purist cringe. Everything about this movie dances on the feet of whats expected. Visually MA almost defies description. To say that is astoundingly, jaw droppingly lovely is a vast understatment. But it's more then that. Most of us have this image of Marie Antoinette dripping in dimonds, cold and sneering as her subjects starve in the streets. Coppola's vision works to deconstruct that image. We see her as the child bride of a fragile alliance, Marie's new home is a viper pit of dager sharp gossip and quiet slander. for more then seven years her husband seems utterly disinterested in consumating their marriage, and for a long time she has no real friends. is it any wonder that she filled her life with excess, perhaps to cover her emptiness and isolation. It can be said that Marie Antoinette was an uneffective ruler but perhaps because she was taught that her purpose began and ended with being sweet, pleasing and compliant,but above all to conceive male heirs. if she was week in the area of political ablity and the skills needed to rule a kingdom maybe the falt was not entirely hers. Dunst Plays MA in three distinct stages of life, young, spirited, if naive child. Loving mother, and determined women. and Finaly doomed Queen. As to the films criticism MA has much in common with Baz Luhrmann's 1996 retelling of Romeo and Juliet in terms of being excentric and over the top. And similar to R&J you'll most likely either love Marie Antoinette or hate it. As for me, I'm not in love with the film but I was very impressed with it as a whole.

1580461,3,B00005JPAS,"Sofia Coppola offers another look at history's infamous Marie Antoinette, the premise being that she was in life just a simple young Austrian girl delivered to France as a political queen candidate, who liked pretty things, loved children, flowers, clothes, shopping, and sweets, and lived a life oblivious to the political turmoil outside the confines of Versailles until it was too late.  Coppola delivers her side of history with a maximum budget, endless sumptuous costumes, shoes, wigs, oft-changed costumed huge cast, top of the line creative cuisine and pastries, a nice little performance by Kirsten Dunst, an extended tour inside Versailles and two hours of minimal dialogue about rather inconsequential matters.

Coppola does mix contemporary music with period music, an anachronism that is not additive but does allow us to see snippets of Rameau's 'Platee' (and a cut version of Susan Graham as Gluck's 'Orfeo' singing 'Che faro Euridice' in French translation on a beautiful stage with a sensuous nude model lying at her feet).  And if Coppola's purpose is to demonstrate how the 'media', whether that be printed or verbal history, has painted an incorrect picture of a charming young child/lady who happened to be blissfully unaware of the changes of the day, she has succeeded.  It just doesn't seem to be enough story for a two hour slick magazine spread on indulgences in France of the late 18th century.

The cast is well chosen: Judy Davis exudes court etiquette as Comtesse de Noailles,  Rip Torn is a fine Louis XV more interested in his consort du Barry as well imitated by Asia Argento, Steve Coogan is Steve Coogan as Ambassador Mercy, Rose Byrne keeps the story afloat as Duchesse de Polignac, and Jason Schwartzman makes us understand why the distracted Louis XVI capitalized the troubles of a clueless court during the time of Revolution.

The endless costume changes are entertaining to the eye but about as repetitive as the too frequent boudoir lack of activity between Marie and Louis.  This is one of those films where the Featurette on the DVD makes the evening worth tolerating; it is fresh, funny, informative, allows bonuses, and ultimately explains why the movie was made in the first place. As for the film itself, it is a long static song. Grady Harp, February 07",1171584000,3,2302,5.007853403141361
1580462,4,B00005JPAS,"This is an amazing film. It's beautiful, well written, well acted, smart, and stylish. I was enthralled watching it almost the whole way through. Still the film fails to deliver 100% due to the fact that it ends rather abruptly. I know what happened to Marie Antoinette in real life. I am sure Sofia Coppola assumed that everyone knew her fate too and decided to end the film when her troubles began. I would have rather seen another full hour of film tacked onto this film that showed the downward spiral of Marie Antoinette. According to history she became haggard, and lost the will to live. She had to endure the loss of her close friends and her husband by beheadings. In the end she met the same fate. I would have explored this. To me the film is missing it's last 1/3. When it ended I felt unfulfilled.

This is still one of the most gorgeous period films ever made and the use of modern music, economic dialogue, and MTV style montages are very unique. Do not let my criticisms deter you from this film. I own it and plan on keeping it. it's just my opinion that it ended too abruptly. Even a short blurb of text about Marie Antoinette and her ultimate demise would have wrapped it up better than the way it ended. Sofia Coppola is one of my favorites, but no one can satisfy everyone all the time.",1171584000,4,1307,4.378600823045267
1580463,1,B00005JPAS,"This movie has plenty of cinematic art in it for anyone who watches movies and looks for that kind of thing. However, I believe the average person would like to be, above all else, entertained while they're watching a movie. Entertaining though, is something that this movie is NOT. From start to finish, the pace is so slow, and the almost non existent dialogue so boring, that by the end, your eyes will be bleeding. The actors try their best to move the story a long and make it somewhat interesting and historically it is, but this sympathetic view towards Marie and Louis just doesn't do it for me. Everyone knows that they die and this movie didn't do anything to make me feel sorry for them.  Frankly, i just don't care ""exactly"" what they did in their spare time around the palace, we all know that they spent tons of money and had fun all the time. Do we really need to see it in a 2-hour movie? I hardly think so. When I had had enough of the film about half way through and couldn't stand watching another awkwardly quiet or obnoxious scene, it occured to me that just maybe at the end of this pathetic and ugly looking rainbow there would be at least one ounce of gold - I was wrong. We know Marie was beheaded but all you need to know is that there is a brief mob scene outside the house and then the movie ends with a solemn carriage ride. YOU DONT EVER GET TO SEE THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF DEATH. I strongly urge that if you are considering checking this movie out, CHANGE YOUR MIND! You will end up wasting 2 hours of your life that you will never get back. Writing this review was time better spent because I feel it is my responsibility as a member to make sure others don't make the same mistake I did.

1580465,4,B00005JPAS,"Say what you may about Marie Antoinette, but it rises far above many other period docudramas simple because it delivers what it promises.  The film depicts Versailles for what it was, style over substance. It reflects the indulgences of privileged youth then and now.  Come on, just substitute any teen royal of today, Paris or Lindsay.  The difference between Marie and the youth of now is that she set trends, she made history, she did her duty as a future queen and bring honor to her newly adopted country.  I always hope these Marie Wannabes of today would just stop embrassing their parents and themselves.  Many critics cried the movie was historically inaccurate, most biopic are. The post punk songs of the soundtrack grew on me and connected the past with the present.  The point was not to distance yourself from someone so young and vulverable.  Sofia did an excellent job with this film. I expected a docudrama, just like ""Ray"" and the ""Aviator"".  If I wanted accuracy, I'll watch PBS(which aired an excellent documentary on Marie Antoinette before this film came out and is on DVD now, check it out!).

1580466,4,B00005JPAS,"You can't really expect traditional style filmmaking when you deal with Sofia Coppola. A lot of what she does is more based on atmosphere and a serene landscape rather than being super realistic and narrative driven. It's probably because of this that the film wasn't that well received at Cannes or with most of the critics. While it's true that the film is potentially polarizing, you got to admit it's nice now and then to watch a film that actually cares about how it looks and what kind of emotions it brings out. It's like a film by Terrence Malick if he ever learned to quit pointing the camera at stuff every 20 seconds.

Marie Antoinette was an Austrian member of royalty who was shipped off to France to marry Louis the XVI and provide an heir. Inexplicably Louis doesn't seem that interested in bedding the beautiful girl which is only one of many problems since she lives in a world where etiquette and protocol are the most important things. At first it's a little minor: she can't dress herself but has to wait for people to do it for her and manners in addressing the King's mistress. But pretty soon things get to her head and she gets into rockstar mode and spends a lot and parties which doesn't sit well at all with the people of France.

If you're looking for a history lesson, read a book. You'll basically get the personal life and intimate details of who she was rather than getting caught up in dates and facts. There's points where you can't tell how much time has passed and have to gauge the film's timeline based on things around her such as the age of her first daughter or dialogue mentioned. But she was likely one of France's most hated queens and rampant rumors spread in France concerning her personal life, such as alleged lesbianism and sodomy. This is a look at a life who never seemed to make a right decision in people's eyes and it's a fascinating look at someone thought to be unbelievably reviled.

One of the more controversial things about the film is the use of a more comtemporary soundtrack, with songs from artists like the Strokes, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Sometimes, such as the case of the Cure's majestic chording in ""Plainsong"" announcing Louis XVI becoming the next King of France and at times there's almost a rock backing with drums and guitar and it works great but then you have the opening credits set to a punk song and the Strokes on here, it just sounds a bit misguided. Certain ideas like the Cure work but other ones didn't work at all and it's a bit of a fumble.

While music-wise it's a little iffy, this is certainly a dreamy kind of film. From the immaculate set design and costuming to the cinematography whenever they actually go outside which is very little is quite stunning. That's one of the things I always liked about this Coppola's movies is that she does know how to frame and point a camera but one brief scene in a garden Marie Antoinette had made had too much of a Virgin Suicides look to it. But regardless this is certainly Sofia's most ambitious looking film and thankfully it delivers. The pacing might throw people, the modern soundtrack might be too distracting but you gotta admit it's a lush looking film.

On one hand, I'm disappointing by the lack of features but since Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation weren't that packed, I guess it's a director thing. But if you're a fan of this film, and be warned that not everyone will; it's serviceable for a film that'll confuse for some and seduce others.",1171324800,3,3510,4.5474683544303796

1580468,5,B00005JPAS,"Marie Antoinette is a name etched in infamy, and the woman who owned the name was deserving of that legendary iconic status...if not necessarily for the right reasons.

This film follows Marie Antoinette through her life's journey, starting with her betrothal and marriage to the Dauphin of France, and ending with the fall of Versaille. As the preview to the film suggests, she was married at 15, a Queen by 19, and a legend by 20.

Sofia Coppola takes the life story of Marie Antoinette and absolutely infuses it with a breathtaking style that will resonate with todays youthful generation, despite the fact that they might not usually enjoy a period piece. The film is almost good enough to eat! The color palette is exquisite, and the extravagant surroundings were the tone for this film, which is not so much of an exact account of history as it is a decadent retelling through the vision of writer/director Sofia Coppola.

The movie was filmed almost entirely at Versaille and the surrounding areas of France, which is incredible since films such as this are very rarely shot in the location they are meant to depict. I believe that during a 'making of' featurette, it was said that this was the first time Versaille opened it's door to allow a movie to be filmed within it's own walls!

Coppola utilizes a unique choice in music to accompany the action of the film. Though the movie starts out sombre, with the expected orchestra music traditional with period films, it then transitions slowly into modern day music as the character of Antoinette grows in life and experiences.

The movie has a few noteworthy special features. The ""making of"" featurette is very interesting, and it does a great job at giving the audience an idea of what it was like to shoot this film. There are also two deleted scenes that are pre-empted by a written detailed paragraph (from Sofia Coppola) that explains the reasons why each scene was removed from the overall film. One of the most interesting special feature is one in which Jason Schwartzman (King Louis XVI)walks around the palace of Versaille, in full character and wardrobe, and gives a tour as if he were doing an episode of MTV's 'Cribs'!

A bit of a sticking point for most people might be that in this instance, Sofia Coppola chose to end the film before Marie Antoinette is beheaded, which makes the ending a little anti-climactic. I understand that she was trying to make the audience think about the *woman*, what she went through, and how she might have felt -- instead of just sitting there waiting for her to get her head chopped off. The way it ends, it almost has sort of a happy ending in the sense that they were beaten and down, but they still had hope.

And for the record...Marie Antoinette never uttered the words ""Let them eat cake"" in response to the growing starvation and unrest among the French people.

Bottom Line, I could write all night about the incredible things in this film, but you'll just have to see it for yourself. I will say that afterwards I had a sudden craving for pink pastries...",1170979200,7,3071,4.695167286245353
1580469,5,B00005JPAS,"Everyone and their mother at Cannes hated this film. They said it lacked substance. How ridiculous! Why would you make a movie about a woman who was essentially beheaded for being frivolous a substantial film? You'd have to be an idiot; and Sofia Coppela is no idiot. It is, however, sympathetic and humanizing without trying to make France's last queen a heroic figure. It's shot a bit like an '80's teen movie in everything from camera angles, sound track, and one frame where Dunst very post-modernly turns directly to the camera. It is maybe the most beautiful film I've ever seen, and I know it accomplishes everything that the director set out to do. Just one warning, it will make you desperately crave champagne and cupcakes.",1170720000,8,733,4.825396825396825
1580470,4,B00005JPAS,"The colors of the costumes are extraordinary and the sets are breathtaking.  The music added whimsy to the film, which I understand from historical record to have been one of the issues that led to Marie and Louis' demise.  The performances were incredible - Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job portraying the misunderstood Queen who wasn't well prepared to rule France in the wake of her Father-In-Law's death.

The scenes of the courtiers assisting the Queen to dress was a real eye-opener.  As were the scenes where the court awaited the birth of Marie's children.  For every little girl who wanted to be a Queen - it's not all it's cracked up to be.  It's a job.  But Marie-Antoinette made it an adventure!",1170720000,5,707,4.699186991869919
1580529,2,B00005JPAS,"Probably I would be one of the minority reports here, but I should be honest. I didn't mind if Marie Antoinette is played by Kirsten Dunst speaking American English because I knew Sofia Coppola's revisionist biography is not a schoolteacher's lesson about history in France. And I liked the mixture of colorful costumes and modern pop music which is unique and imaginative (thanks to the photography of Lance Accord and costume designer Milena Canonero). But to me, Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" turned out unexpectedly boring especially during its second half of it even though it tells a story of a person who lived a very eventful life. Retelling a familiar story is a good thing, but when the new story bores you, that would be a big trouble.

I won't repeat the life story of Marie Antoinette. The new film presents her as a more vivacious, playful, or often brave and vulnerable person than is generally supposed. Casting Kirsten Dunst is a success to achieve this goal, and her portrait of the Queen of France shows undercurrent loneliness and emptiness of her life in Versailles. Colorful costumes and pop numbers like Bow Wow Wow's `I Want Candy' perfectly match her image as a young woman living the life of unreality.

Sadly, as in her previous `Lost in Translation,' Sofia Coppola fails to create and develop anything original out of the great materials she is given, except good acting from some of the cast and the gorgeous mood of the place. While the film traces the life story of Marie Antoinette and her relationships with Louis XVI, Louis XV and his mistress and her affair with Count Fersen, it never sheds light on the inner side of her enigmatic character which still intrigues us. Here Louis XVI is reduced to a shy and weak youth; Madame Du Barry a disreputable woman, and Count Fersen a hunky aristocrat. All these hackneyed characterizations only help make the persona of Marie Antoinette less credible and more melodramatic.

Of course Sofia Coppola has a right to show her own vision, or what she wants us to see, and sorry, but having interested in Marie Antoinette, I expected more. This film is a real eye candy which is good, but if this is only about the gorgeous costume and hairstyle, what's the point of re-telling the story of this famous historical figure now?",1169510400,24,2303,4.795969773299748

As the movie moves forward you see her grow as a person and as a Queen. How sadly she was one of the most misunderstood and hated Queens/people in history. The story is a sad one that hits you right at home without being fake...its completely human. Sofia Copolla did a completely perfect job on this movie.

She becomes caught up in the food and glamour as a way to ease the troubles of her new life, complete with being yet unable to bear an heir (through no fault of her own).

Kirsten Dunst is perfect as the Queen and she did not strike me as the dominant and selfish being historians have spoken of the real Marie Antoinette. The story is accurate enough in the eighteenth century historical sense with the young lady characters possessing the youthful feminine gaity of today's young woman. So many hip hop songs and punk songs very well conjoined the joy of the female and male frivolites of the Enlightenment era to now. The added classical and baroque pieces were very essential. The silks and satins of the gowns just flowed as if they too had a life of their own. Rip Torn is wonderful as the late King of France and a perfect choice of an eighteenth century monarch. The characters could so well make the viewers wish to join in the parties at court and at the ball. All the rituals of being attended every morning out of bed and dressing would indeed become very tiresome to Marie; I wonder how her spouce was attended to each sunrise. But she lived life well and how her husband and her loveable children crowned her happiness. I could not stand Madame Du Barry; I'd love elbowing that cruel woman myself! Her snubbing Marie like that is so intolerable! The innocence Kirsten portrays condradicts the historical stature of the real Marie's socially given icon, which maks her character more special and more intriging.

The dialogue is beautifully written and often times quite funny, and the actors' delivery is charming and lifelike. In fact, I haven't seen a more charismatic cast of characters assembled outside of a Fellini or Woody Allen film.
Granted, it is very little of what one would expect a movie about a famous historical figure to be. This is no grand epic, but Sofia Coppola's aesthetic approach makes the experience both intimate and captivating in a way that an epic could not have managed.",1167609600,14,750,4.8671875

The film is about Marie Antoinette as a person; how extravagant she was, how oblivious to anything outside of Versailles.

1580538,4,B00005JPAS,"'Marie Antoinette' tries to do with it's subject matter what 'Amadeus' did for Mozart.  This playful rendition is done reflectively by the artful hand of director Sofia Coppola who through Kirsten Dunst gives us a sympathetic portrayal.  Being the olive branch from and for Austria, Marie's acquisition as the queen of France takes on a whole new meaning.  Since her young husband King Louis XVI is more interested in hunting than consummating their marriage, she fails to live up to her role of providing a successor--for a consequentially long time.  She drowns her sorrows through the morning ritual, complete with courtiers who dote on every morning whim, including champagne, sumptuous food, and a large appetite for extravagant confections.  All the details are done in stunning detail, even if Ms. Coppola stops to reflect too long and too often.  Their dereliction is not entirely apparent to them, but is solidified when Louis, ironically, decides to fund the American Revolution at his expense--in more ways than one.  Once her appetite for gambling and jewels is solidified, it is hard to retract its effects on long bread lines and excruciating poverty.  The repercussions creep up on them, making the audience feel its blind-siding impact from the couples' point-of-view.  In order for the film to work, we have to sympathize with the protagonists, and at first we do.  For throwing away decorum, she charitably introduces applause at the opera, and quickly and easily freezes all need for new jewelry.  The classical and rock music accentuate the scenes, and, while it may seem misplaced for the latter, we realize how much of a tragic misfit she may have been in the royal scheme of things.  The rest, as they say, is history.

'Marie Antoinette' is a stylish, if not overlong, new look at a colorful, misunderstood famous figure.  Usually personified as arrogance itself, she shrugged off being misunderstood and let's us know that she did not indeed say, ""Let them eat cake"" afterall.  Whether revisionism or not, this film is interesting in its own right.",1167264000,,2073,5.055882352941176
1580589,4,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors for her style is one all her own, and one that is so unique and revolutionary that it cowers over most directors today. With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between. I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.

As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul. When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France. Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know. The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all. Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her. Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.

Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution. As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen. She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.

`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her. In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her. This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution. The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.

One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used. Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained. That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do. It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation. Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance. Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy. The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.

As a whole I was very impressed with this film. Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully. Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination. Love it or hate it, `Marie Antoinette' is a one of a kind film that supports a revolutionary vision and serves us entertainment as sweet as pie...err cake.",1167091200,,4521,4.583436341161928

the actor who played the heroine was a bad cast who never made herself seriously perform this queen of france. she was just having some fun changing clothes, wearing lot of shoes, hugging different poodles, enjoying the free chow. all the other supporting actors who played any necessary and unnecessry roles in this film also turned out to be one dimensional cardboard like figures. nobody and nothing ever developed well.
an absolute hollow screenplay with bad directing is one thing. inappropriate composed sound track that further ridiculed the movie of that specific era is another unforgivable mistake.
this movie could only compare to that ridiculous, hollow, shallow, empty, big-yawn chinese movie played by zhang ziyi?, ""the banquet"", and possibly the even worse coming-to-theatre new movie, 'curse of the golden flower', directed by the totally mind-losing zhang yimou who's now obsessed in blow-out-of-water budget for materialism for his pathetic movie making.

huge budgets, lousy and hollow screenplays, bad directings, meaningless, purposeless overdone and over-kill luxrious visual stunning settings, costumes, special effects, ridiculous manpower wastes.

In fact, I haven't seen a more charismatic cast of characters assembled outside of a Fellini or Woody Allen film.
It is very little of what one would expect a movie about a famous historical figure to be. It's not a grand epic, but Sofia Coppola has such a strong aesthetic approach that she manages to creates an experience that is intimate and captivating in a way that an epic could not have managed.",1165449600,5,572,4.617647058823529
1580593,4,B00005JPAS,"I saw this film with my grown-up daughter and I loved it. I think what the Director was trying to do was to show how the amoral excessive behavior of the French nobility (especially young nobility) during the late 18th Century parallels our own time. That's why it doesn't show the horrors of the poverty in Paris because it is portraying the microcosm that was Versailles in all its ignorance of the rest of the world. I got the impression that an awful lot of effort went into the art design of this movie and the costumes and food and furniture design are really superb. In my opinion, Marie had a good idea of what was ahead of her at the end of the story in the film, despite her sheltered life (after all we know she corresponded with her brother). In my opinion, the best scene is the one of the candlelit dinner in the tent when someone walks on the table. I found the Duchesse de Polignac to be extremely amusing. The soundtrack didn't bother me and I did not grow up with it - I really liked the punk music in the scene of the masked ball.

1580594,4,B00005JPAS,"I was living in France when I saw this film. And, while definitely not what one would typically expect from a film about the French monarchy, it was exactly what I expected from Sofia Coppola and (oddly enough) Kirsten Dunst - youthful, emotional, beautifully photographed. While it may have received poor reviews at Cannes, this was one of the only movies that I saw during my year living in Paris that the French did not laugh at. (Among the other movies I went to see: the DaVinci Code, The New World..) I thought that it was whimsical and offered a fresh perspective on a tried and true character. It is not about the Revolution. It is more concerned with Marie-Anoinette as an individual. I really enjoyed the integration of New Order, et c., into the film. Also, the purple chuck taylors in one of the scenes emphasizing her decadence. They just barely slipped them in. It makes youth and naivete seem more universal. It makes Marie-Anoinette relatable, hip. I think that the more movies can emphasize the universality of certain experiences, the better. But maybe that's just me.

Anyway, I love it. Completely love it. I didn't get to go see it in the U.S., so I don't know if they changed anything... They definitely changed parts of the newest Pride and Prejudice. (But don't get me started.)",1165190400,3,1302,4.7105263157894735

1580596,2,B00005JPAS,"This film tells the story of Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Empress of Austria. The Empress has arranged her marriage to the Dauphin of France, Louis XVI. Apparently his father is dead, because his grandfather is the king, and he has some brothers, but it's not really clear who is who.

Marie has some friends at first, ladies of the court, but she dumps them for her sisters-in-law's company. Then her former friends talk about her behind her back. Part of what makes this movie so tedious is the inane dialogue. There's lots of whispered gossip, and just ordinary, boring everyday talk.

Being inexperienced, even though there is lots of filthy talk at court, Louis XVI does not perform his marital duty for some years. When a sister-in-law has a baby, Marie congratulates her, then runs away to hide and bawl her eyes out. She doesn't cry because she wants a baby, she cries because if she doesn't have one, they'll kick her out - as her mother the Empress frequently reminds her. Her job is to be charming and patient with the Dauphin, no matter how fat and uncharming he may be.

The king finally contracts smallpox, and they are called to his deathbed. He has no poxes visible though, and he seems hale and hearty as ever as he gives his farewell speech. His poor mistress, Madame DuBarry, has to vacate the premises. Then Louis and Marie become King and Queen. Louis has meetings with his advisors, he agrees with whatever they say, and then the poor folk get tired of supporting the rich folk.

All I could think about, when I was awake, was how much the set designs must have cost. It was gorgeous, but there were no characters to put in them.",1163894400,7,1656,4.565656565656566

Mostly teenagers that just wanted to have fun.  Of course the time and circumstance dictated the kind of social etiquette and ritual that is completely foreign to most of us.

The absolute focus on Marie made the other characters, including Louis the 16th, peripheral to the story.

1580598,5,B00005JPAS,"I Really Love Marie Antoinette (the movie)

Somehow I suspected that I'd like Marie Antoinette, written and directed by Sofia Coppola. I'd been confused by Virgin Suicides, and hated Lost in Translation. I  wasn't sure what other people were seeing in her films.

I heard enough about the film, especially about the soundtrack, that I thought Ms. Coppola might have come upon a character and story she could relate to and tell well. I saw the film the first time in a theater  full and every person, but myself, was of the female gender. I though it was beautiful and touching.

I was drawn back a couple of days later and I was mesmerized by Kirsten Dunst's acting. I was/am sure she deserves awards for her performance. The next time I saw it, I was astonished at how funny Marie Antoinette is. This could and will continue. I am so looking forward to owning Marie Antoinette so I can watch it at home as much as I like or need to watch it.

Sofia, has made, at a very young age, a ""Costume Drama,"" to rival, not supercede, Barry Lyndon, by the master Stanley Kubrick. I will enjoy seeing this film as much as possible. Watching it is like viewing an original masterpiece by a very accomplished artist.

Thanks Sofia.",1163635200,5,1219,4.513636363636364
1580659,2,B00005JPAS,"""We are too young to reign"" says Louis  XVI as he and Marie are crowned. This movie demonstrates the truth of this. Oblivious to the world around, these cool young aristocrats enjoy all that life has to offer.  The movie succedes in portrying the hedonistic extravagance of the late 18th century French court, but for the viewer, it doesn't end too soon.

Clothing, servants, food, endless parties.  Revolution may be the only answer for those outside these walls who pay the bills that Louis approves.

It's a relief not to hear British accents which are common in most US made historical dramas, regardless of the country portrayed. The sets and costumes are a feast for the eyes. Marianne Faithful's voice reading the Empress of Austria's letters to her daughter is worth the price of admission. But the movie doesn't work.

One problem is that there isn't enough action or dialog to fill the time.  Shots of fountains, people climbing Versailles' broad staricases, shoes being removed from boxes and drinks being poured recur and recur. These last far too long.

Another problem is that Dunst is not a frivolous 15 year old, and looks exactly like an adult playing a teen through a lot of movie, which makes her adult years similarly unconvincing. The experiment with contemporary music works in the masked ball in Paris scene, but is generally a distraction. It may be the fault of the script, but the acting in many scenes such as, the royals being told of the crowd outside Versailles, those with Louis XV's tart and that of Marie's girlfriends' visit to her country estate is pretty sophmoric.

I wonder who this movie was made for.  When the concept was marketed to the money people, how was it framed?  It's not a chick flick. It will not appeal to the history buff.  The only satisfied viewers might be those interested in historical costume and design.",1163548800,9,1864,4.790625
1580660,2,B00005JPAS,"I recently had the displeasure of seeing Marie Antoinette over the weekend. I knew before seeing the film that it was going to be a fluff piece judging by all the negative reviews I had read. So it didn't come as a shock to me to see how bad this film is. It is a shame that this film is a major disappointment. I love Sophia Coppola's other films. Marie Antoinette is a turkey compared to Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation.

""Marie Antoinette"" is based on the Antonia Fraser biography ""Marie Antoinette: the Journey"". Unfortunately this film only focuses on Marie Antoinette's life as a queen. The film makes no mention of her childhood or what follows after the queen and king are evacuated from their home during the French Revolution. Do not expect a character study in this fluff piece of a biopic. The film does not present Marie Antoinette as a complicated individual as Antonia Fraser's novel does. Sophia Coppola presents her as Paris Hilton of her era.

My biggest issues with this turkey is: a) the lack of foreign accents, and b) the inclusion of modern music. Since when did Marie Antoinette speak with an American accent? Was Sophia Coppola too darn lazy to make her cast to learn to speak a different accent other than their own?!Kirsten Dunst's lack of an Austrian accent did not make for a convincing performance. I also did not like Kirsten as Marie Antoinette altogether. Reese Witherspoon or Scarlett Johanssen would have a been a better choice. Secondly, I love the '80s. I love The Cure. I love Siouxsie & The Banshees. This type of music did not belong in a period film. This collection of '80s music made the film feel like one extended music video. The writing was weak. The film was truly lacking in a direction. I don't even think there was much of a plot to the story. The only thing I liked about this otherwise dreadful film was the costumes otherwise this was a major dissapointment from a talented filmmaker.",1163376000,8,1946,4.63768115942029

The attempt to interplay least-common-denominator rock music with 18th century French opulence I found quite annoying (and the music was of poor melodic quality).

1580663,5,B00005JPAS,"Sofia Coppola is the real star of this movie.  Like her short film, ""Lick the Star"" she uses her direction to create an atmosphere of female naughtiness in the most couture sense.  Her female characters are so ""haute"", they are above our understanding, so ""cool"", they can only look down on us from their pedestals of ""I-want-you-to-want-me land""  Like Chloe, or Lux, Marie Antoinette is one of these vixens let loose and set free to rock music and left to her teenage tantalizing.
Marie Antoinette is like Chanel No 5 perfume-timeless, misunderstood-but beautiful and not meant for the timid.
""Marie Antoinette"" is based on the Antonia Fraser biography...an excellent choice-more daring and novel-like.
Filmed from the point-of-view of a fifteen year old girl, who at first, is taunted like the new girl at school trying to pick out her seat in a gossipy filled high-school cafeteria.  Marie's entire existence is within the walls of Versailles that confine her.  At first, she resists the barriers of her new station-even having to give up her beloved pets and friends, then like any adventurous teenager, she rebels -she parties, drinks, gambles.  What else is a girl of 15 to do when she is given the keys to a kingdom of luxuries and decadence?
It's akin to watching Gustav, the fat kid in Willy Wonka, enter the candy-filled room the first time.  I would be eating cake night and day too, and indeed Marie Antoinette does just that-she gorges herself in her own wealth until it begins to eat away at her sheltered existence.  After becoming a young Queen, a young mother, she eventually becomes a young target at the center of a world-wide revolution. The ""Queen of debt"" , as she was known, realizes life at Versailles is not life at all-only a edifice, filled with every luxury to entertain her and keep her blind from the realities of French life, poverty, truth and eventually war.
Bravo to Sofia Coppola for creating yet another world of female excitement and tension, and sexuality.  I adore the mix of marzipan colors and MTV video-esque imagery, you really feel submerged in a teenager's world of gluttony and flirtation.
This film simultaneously captures the history of the infamous Marie as Queen of France and her fragile downfall as a young teen, testing the borders of her power, control, and blooming sexuality.",1163030400,5,2331,4.895939086294416
1580664,4,B00005JPAS,"Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor.  Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, ""Let them eat cake,"" when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time).  Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, ""Marie Antoinette,"" based on the book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.

In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her.  The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries.  She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.

In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time.  We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen.  Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out.  Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace.  Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his ""problem.""

There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence.  She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it.  Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation.  But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed.  At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace.  Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty.  Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.

The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la ""A Knight's Tale"").  For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness.  History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.

""Marie Antoinette"" is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered.  Seen in that light, this is a very sad, very poignant - though often quite funny - movie indeed.",1162857600,74,4456,5.001353179972936

Lets face it, acting, camera angles and costumes don't always portray everything I want to know about what the characters are feeling (With the exception of Glenn Close at the end of Dangerous Liasons--chilling!)

I should say that it is reported in history books that Louis had a painful skin ""attachment"" shall we say and that made erections painful, he literally was afraid to get aroused... the doctors snipped it and WALLA...the game was on!

1580666,3,B00005JPAS,"Other than a sincere performance from Kirsten Dunst, and a charming, but anachronistic one from Jason Schwarzman, there is no reason to see this film.

It follows the story of the young Austrian princess Marie who is sent to marry the crown prince of France, as a way of sealing the alliance between the two nations.  She is initially shunned as backward and ignorant...and her clueless husband can't figure out how to consumate their marriage.  Eventually, she learns the political ropes a little, becomes the toast of Versailles, and turns into a party-girl.  Finally, the people of France rebel against all the taxes they are paying to cover the ridiculous expenses of the royals, and Marie and her now dear husband are dragged off in disgrace and ignobility.  There, I saved you the trouble.

The movie features seemingly endless long shots of Marie wandering around the grouns of Versailles in lovely costumes.  She looks mostly bored when doing this, and it began to feel like director Sophia Coppola was just so proud of being able to film at the actual Versailles that she had to keep showing it over and over and over and over and...etc.  That, or the French tourism industry paid her to do it.  I got so sick of these pace-killing scenes.  Almost as sick as I became of the party montage scenes. Watch Marie get lots of lovely desserts and look decadent with her friends eating them.  Watch her drink lots of expensive wine with her drunken friends.  Watch her drink lots of expensive wine with her drunken friends.  WAIT...DID I REPEAT MYSELF?  Just like the damn film did...useless repitition.  We get the point already!!  Marie liked to party.

(I've read some speculation that this film is meant to be a commentary on modern young Americans growing up famous...or perhaps it's meant to be autobiographical on some level.  Whatever...who cares.)

The movie would get one star from me for lovely sets and costumes, and for giving part (however small) to the always fantastic Judy Davis.  But it earns another half star for the quirky performance of Jason Schwarzman.  He is frustrating and oddly endearing as the truly clueless royal prince.  When he finally thaws towards Marie and grows fond of her...the movie has some life in it.  Someone for Marie to have a real, believable relationship with.

And the other 1.5 stars come for Kirsten Dunst's great performance.  It feels lively, and thoughtful, and lived in.  Too bad it's wasted in the hands of a self-indulgent director.  Sophia Coppola made one interesting tone piece with LOST IN TRANSLATION...which benefited mostly from her own literate script and a knockout performance by Bill Murray.  Her other film was the messy, emotionally incoherent VIRGIN SUICIDES...in which she got another nice but wasted performance from Dunst.

In MARIE ANTOINETTE, I must conclude that Coppola should stick to writing and let someone else less in love with herself do the directing.  Dunst is steller, Schwarzman charming...but the movie is mostly dull.

Sorry to say, in this costume spectacular and critics' darling...the empress has no clothes.  (Sorry about the bad pun.)",1162598400,2,3131,4.973025048169557

It is about Versailles - the Hall of Mirrors - look in the mirror!  How shallow are all your minds that you cannot think, cannot see the obvious?  The Emperor had no clothes, so MA has to have lots of clothes!

Sofia Coppola is a genius to force us to feel all ranges of emotions throughout the film.  She forces us to absorb all the visuals in a very short time (about 6 minutes average per year if we count approximately age 14 to age 34 - 20 years of MA's life.)  She translates a typical linear plot into today's fragmentary television/advertising techniques and voila - subtle and subliminal!

1580668,3,B00005JPAS,"Director Sofia Coppola certainly takes an audacious look at the life of the legendary 18th century Queen of France who supposedly ""let them eat cake"" in this elaborately costumed 2006 film. At the same time, Coppola keeps the dramatic focus relatively small versus the expansive political backdrop of the story. The approach works to a point since the filmmaker has an obviously reflective handle on how a young girl can feel when thrown unexpectedly into the spotlight and then made mincemeat by her critics (think of her aborted acting career when 1990's ""The Godfather III"" was released).

The downside is that the dramatic arc of the French monarch's life feels somewhat misshapen by this unique perspective since the film's first three-quarters meticulously follows Marie's youthful ascent to the throne and her wearying efforts to consummate her arranged marriage to Louis XVI. There are throwaway scenes of shopping sprees with her ladies-in-waiting and an underdeveloped illicit romance with Count Fersen, all of which would not look out of place in an episode of ""Sex and the City"". Once she conceives and delivers her first child, the movie starts to feel cursory about subsequent events with little of the historic context needed to make the climax resonate.

For all the film's dramatic flaws, I have to say Kirsten Dunst is ideally cast in the title role. Starting her role as a 14-year old Austrian princess taken from her family, she captures not only the giggly vacuity but the sense of self-possession and decorum that makes her viable as a queen. A curiously cast Jason Schwartzman gained weight for the role of her bulbous, emotionally indifferent husband, Louis. He says relatively little but his natural awkwardness in period costume succeeds in making the king an ultimately sympathetic figure. Others come in and out of the story though with little resonance, even with proven scenery chewers like Judy Davis as the instructional Contesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan as the advice-giving Ambassador Mercy, Rip Torn as the libidinous Louis XV, and Asia Argento as his blatantly whorish mistress, Madame du Barry.

What does work well are most of the visual elements - the use of real Versailles locales augmented by K.K. Barrett's luxuriant production design, Lance Acord's candy-colored cinematography, and Milena Canonero's resplendent costumes. The anachronistic use of 1980's-era new wave music, blended with the Baroque music true to the period and Jean-Benot Dunckel and Nicolas Godin's original score, turns out to be a daring choice that works well toward Coppola's revisionist view of the queen. Yet for all the creativity on display, one is left to linger on the movie's unfulfilled possibilities of how the economic downturn and class disparities in 18th century France could be seen as a mirror for today. But that aspect obviously doesn't interest Coppola, who shows as she did in ""Lost in Translation"", a deep affinity for women caught out of place and the ways they handle their loneliness.",1162080000,3,3025,5.169387755102041

1580701,2,B00005JPAS,"I couldn't get through ten minutes of ""Marie Antoinette"" without questioning what the point was. It certainly wasn't to tell a historically accurate story; despite the bold set and costume designs, the sparse moments of dialogue were completely modern, and the film's soundtrack made use of recent pop songs. That didn't really bother me, considering that many well-made period films have been very inaccurate. Maybe then the point was to portray the title character in a different light, one that would reveal how misunderstood she was in real life. If that was the intention, then something went wrong; I left the theater feeling no more enlightened than I did upon entering. Rather than delve into the complexities of Marie's mind, the film focuses on the rituals and traditions that were common in eighteenth century Europe. It was interesting, yes, but it didn't feel personal enough, and it did little if anything to help me understand the real Marie Antoinette.

No wonder this movie is a mess; it was written and directed by Sofia Coppola, who completely missed the mark in 2003 with the grossly overrated ""Lost in Translation."" Both films prove that her writing style simply doesn't work (and I think it's about time someone told her so). In the case of ""Marie Antoinette,"" we're presented with a story that goes absolutely nowhere, with each cut marking the end of yet another flat, bloodless scene. It doesn't help that half of the actors are miscast, including Rip Torn as Louis XV and Molly Shannon as a snobbish gossip-freak. Because of that, the style and emphasis they give their characters are way off track. Adding insult to injury are the film's unbearable pacing and length. I can't recall the last time I've been this bored watching a movie; I needed a jolt of caffeine by the middle just to keep from nodding off.

And then there's Marie Antoinette herself, played with girlish innocence by Kirsten Dunst. I didn't feel as if I had the chance to explore her character fully; she felt shallow and unrefined, as if Dunst wasn't interested in the role. There's a wealth of things to see on the surface, such as laughter, tears, and the rebellious need to party and gamble in the midst of sophisticated royalty. Historically, it's easy to understand her behavior; in 1770, at the tender age of fourteen, she's arranged to marry Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman). This required her to leave her native Austria, not just physically, but emotionally, as well, casting aside all traces of her previous life (including her clothes, her friends, and her dog). Such a transition is understandably difficult for a teenager, considering she now has to take on responsibilities that a lot of adults aren't ready for.

This alone was good material for to Coppola to work with, and it's a shame she used it without giving much thought to Marie. The best we're initially given is the occasional critique of how ridiculous some of the royal rituals are, such as having lower-ranking royalty dress her in the morning. We also have some tense moments between her and Louis, with the pressure to produce an heir weighing heavily upon them. But Louis is incredibly shy, pretty much to the point of ignoring her. Here's a character that didn't require a lot of effort; he's a quiet, detached young man who spends most of his time looking down. With such a passive attitude, you'd think Schwartzman could have perfected the role. He didn't. Truth be told, he completely ruined it. I've rarely seen an actor give less for a performance; he was an emotionless drone who didn't act so much as he read his lines.

How could such a flat performance help an already weak film? The reality is that it can't. This is bad because the more serious portions of the story begin to pile up. For one thing, Marie isn't getting along with Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), Louis XV's mistress and a former prostitute. But more importantly, Marie and her husband have not been successful in the bedroom, with her attempts at initiating sexual contact flatly rejected (it's historically known that their marriage wasn't consummated for about seven years, and the audience is shown this during some incredibly repetitive scenes). Marie's mother, Maria Teresa (Marianne Faithful), is convinced that her daughter isn't ""inspiring"" him enough, and she continuously writes her letters of concern. Apparently, the future Queen of France can't be taken seriously unless she's pregnant.

All of these ideas would have worked had Dunst not been directed to be so unflatteringly dull; even some elaborately shot party sequences didn't do much to enhance her screen presence. The material excess is shown to the fullest during these scenes, not the least of which come in the form of little pastries that Marie can't get enough of. She drinks champagne by the bottle. She wears dresses made of the finest materials. She even plays casino-type games with her friends, laughing the entire time. These moments are rich in visuals, yet they're completely hollow in spirit. There's no substance to what we're watching; there's only the illusion that an important story is being told.

It isn't until the last half hour of the film that Marie becomes interesting, and by then it's too late. Such a pity: that's when she speaks a majority of her dialogue (before then, she couldn't have gotten more than ten lines in). Many years have passed and now she has children, all of whom she loves dearly (the film establishes early on how comfortable she is around children). Slowly her life comes to revolve around the need to be herself. She has her husband build her a sanctuary where she can be a mother as well as a free spirit, complete with a guesthouse, a vegetable garden, and some animals to take care of (lambs, chickens, ducks, etc.). She's the happiest during these scenes, and from the audience's point of view, she feels more like a complete character and less like a sketch. That level of complexity should have been there from the very beginning; at least then it wouldn't have been so excruciating to sit through to the end.

And what of the end? The ultimate fate of the real Marie Antoinette is well known, but even then, I found that the final scenes of this film adaptation lacked something. Historically, we know that the people of France came to hate her for her constant spending (not helped by her husband's financial support of the American Revolution). But the film pays such little attention to this that it virtually voids the entire idea; just because Marie was sheltered from the realities of daily life didn't mean that the audience had to be. I wanted so much more from ""Marie Antoinette."" I wanted complexity. I wanted intensity. I wanted some kernel of knowledge about the main character to be planted in my brain. It didn't deliver; Sofia Coppola directed an empty, uninteresting film, one that is neither entertaining nor insightful. Much like the operators of the guillotine, I say off with its head.",1161907200,9,7012,4.867671691792295
1580702,5,B00005JPAS,"One week after seeing it, I can't stop thinking about how amazing this film is. If you like Sofia Coppola, champagne, desserts, dresses, shoes, post-punk, new wave, Versailles, parties, sleep, subtle humor and quiet introspection, you will probably enjoy this film. If you prefer heavy dialogue delivered in a British accent, political intrigue, French history and Vivaldi, you might just avoid this film and save yourself the trouble of writing a terrible review.

Sofia Coppola perfectly captures what it feels like to be young and what it might have felt like to be Marie Antoinette. The glamour, joy and excesses of the teen queen are explored alongside her mistakes, disappointments and, ultimately, her strength and resolve. Five stars.",1161907200,2,742,5.288135593220339
1580703,3,B00005JPAS,"I have talked about this before, but Sofia Coppola's new film ""Marie Antoinette"" prompts me to revisit the subject. When a filmmaker creates a successful film, they earn a certain amount of cache. Imagine they receive a credit card. If the film is both financially and critically successful, they earn a higher credit balance. They can then use this credit card for their next film. The amount of credit they spend on their next project would depend on the esoteric quality of the film. Then, based on the success of that film, their credit card either has a revolving balance or a fixed spending limit.

Sofia Coppola had a big success on her hands with ""Lost in Translation"", her first film. It almost earned Bill Murray an Oscar, made a star of Scarlett Johannson and earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Coppola. Then, she decided to make ""Maria Antoinette"". I suspect her credit balance is very low.

On paper, ""Marie Antoinette"" sounds like an intriguing project. An American director shooting a film about an Icon of French History, in Versailles, with a rising American actress and a largely American and British cast. Throw in some modern music and great costumes and you have the concept behind Coppola's newest film.

On the screen, ""Marie"" lacks substance. There is a ton of great production design, but that is like frosting on a cake. It looks good, and tastes good, but it doesn't provide a lot of substance.

At 14, Marie (Kirsten Dunst), an Austrian princess, is sent to France to marry the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzman). Initially, she is very confused and feels isolated, but her mother pleads with her to make the best of the situation, for her home country. The King (Rip Torn) takes a liking to the young lady, but there is trouble in the marriage bed. The Dauphin is very scared of his new wife and it takes seven years for them to consummate the marriage. During this time, the gossip in the court of Versailles is rampant. Why can't she produce an heir to the throne? Is she barren? Would she prefer some strudel? Finally, a daughter is born and then, soon, a son and an heir to the throne. Then, the King dies and the Dauphin becomes King Louis XVI. And Marie, the new Queen of France, goes on a spending spree, cavorting with her friends, buying new clothes and shoes with every turn. As the French people fight for every scrap of food, the Queen's excess comes to notice and they start to protest.  There are moments in ""Marie Antoinette"" that reminded me of some of the films of the 70s. There are long sequences meant to establish a mood, rather than to depict a specific part of history. During these sequences, we see Marie running through fields with her daughter, brushing her cheek, reveling in motherhood at long last. Or she lays in a rowboat with other friends, on a lazy, sunny afternoon. Or she runs excitedly through the hallways of Versailles.

This style of filmmaking is interesting and uncommon in this day and age, but it takes some getting used to. You either have to be able to figure out what the director is trying to accomplish or let your imagination run wild.

The other problem is that these same sequences often resemble Nivea, perfume or female medication ads. The sun sparkling in Dunst's hair as she runs through fields of wildflowers. Marie Antoinette just has to take one pill for a problem free month.

And because there are multiple scenes like this, it makes the film seem long and without substance.

There are better scenes depicting the excess of life in the Court of Versailles, the gossiping among the ruling class and more, but these don't fill the story.

The performances are interesting. Dunst does a good job of conveying Marie Antoinette's confusion, then boredom, then sexual attraction. But we don't really get a look inside her head. Maybe that's the point. Because she lived in such excess, and the court lived in such seclusion, maybe that is all we are supposed to see. We see her eat a lot of expensive food, try on a lot of shoes, the like. She mentions a couple of times that she would like to go to Paris, to the Opera, but the family lives at Versailles and rarely ventures outside.

This is also a key point in the history of France. Because the ruling family is so isolated, it is difficult for them to understand the difficulties of their people. We get it.

And from the way the film portrays her, Marie Antoinette didn't seem to care very much. But we never see what the people are doing, what their struggle is like. A couple of advisors make some vague statements, but this is the extent of the influence from the outside world.

The other interesting addition is the use of modern day music. This has been done before, in ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", to name two memorable examples. In ""A Knight's Tale"", the music was more pervasive but never really worked, except for the use of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"". In ""Moulin Rouge"", director Baz Luhrmann fully integrated modern day music into his tale of a doomed relationship set in Paris during the early 1900s. Coppola doesn't use enough music to make it part of the fabric of the film. Because she uses so little music, it stands out all the more, making it seem odd and out of place. For this reason, her effort is more similar to the dreadful ""A Knight's Tale"" than the sublime ""Moulin Rouge"".

It seems like if we are going to watch a film depicting Marie Antoinette's life, we need to learn something about her, see her in a different light, or learn about the other influences on her life. Because she and the rest of her family live in such isolation, it is difficult for us to see beyond that as well.

And because we are looking for something more, and the film doesn't deliver this, our sugar high is quite brief indeed.

I just wish I had been allowed to eat more cake.",1161820800,3,5836,4.591738712776177
1580704,1,B00005JPAS,"I love history, I love France, I love French history, but I did not love this movie. There are so many bad things in this film that they just overrule the good things. It had a lot of potential, but it fell short of a great film that it could have been.
I was originally interested to see how this movie would turn out but I was sadly disappointed. I understand that they said it was a ""history of emotions rather than a history of facts."" But if that was the case, why put any real history in it at all? They might as well have set it in modern LA and have a wannabe teenybopper get trampled by paparazzi.

Here are some pros and cons of why I did and did not like this movie:

Pros:
1. The visual effects were nice.

2. I loved the costumes, they were really beautiful to look at.

3. Very beautiful backgrounds. It is actually filmed IN FRANCE! Not some lame set, but on location, with permission by the French government, how cool is that!

4. Some good acting.

5. At least they tried.

6. Good looking food.

Cons:
1. So historically inaccurate that it was annoying. People who don't know much about this subject will be very confused.

2. Not entertaining in the least bit.

3. It wasn't even about a `history of emotions.' If it really was, it would have shown how depressed she got later in life, especially after her husbands death. If they wanted to show a `history of emotions,' they would have shown her wearing all black, crying, without makeup, and being on trial. THAT'S emotion.

4. They didn't even mention the Diamond Necklace Affair, which was a HUGE plot point. You can't tell the story of Marie Antoinette without the story of the Diamond Necklace Affair. Look it up if you don't know what it is. But if it was in the movie there would be no point to look it up, right? You know I am.

5. You don't see much about what caused the French Revolution. It's portrayed as though the citizens of France one day woke up and said ""Hum, let's start a war for no reason."" It took years to get the war started, and it's all because of Marie Antoinette and her cold and unfeeling behavior toward the people. But you don't see any of that until the very end.

6. All the marchers upon Versailles were women or men posing as women. They did that because it was considered wrong to kill women, no matter what they were doing.

7. No mention of Robespierre, Saint Just, Lafayette, or any other revolutionary/loyalist leader.

8. Some historians say that Louis had phimosis, which is why he and Marie didn't have sex for the first few years of marriage. (By the way, when they got married, she was fourteen, he was fifteen). I have also heard other accounts saying that Louis was a homosexual, while others say Marie was a lesbian. By the way, I don't believe any of this is true.  They were children when they got married after all.

9. The dialog and music did not match the time period. No one in their right mind puts 21st century American Pop rock music into an 18th century French period movie In a movie such as this you need Mozart, Bach, Handel, Beethoven, and Haydn's work, and not some modern teenybopper. Secondly, Marie Antoinette is portrayed like a Brittney Speers, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Lindsay Lohan mixed together. I realize that she was a considered little out of control-FOR HER TIME; were talking about late 1700' to early 1800's, an absolutely totally different time period. Even Marie Antoinette would be shocked by how those *hem* act. It goes back to saying that it should have taken place in modern LA.

10. The sex scene was awful.

11. What's with all the horrible ways of portraying Louis XVI?  He was not the bumbling, idiotic fool that you see in the movie.  He was smart, kind, loving man of God.  He certainly was not a fool.

And finally, I ask all of you who wanted to see her beheaded a question: Why? There is so much more to the story than the guillotine. If you are obsessed about the guillotine, you need to get a life. I'm not a tree hugger or anything, but seriously, come on.

So just like Ebert on Roper Ebert said, its little more than dessert porn. All in all, beautiful costumes, horrible show.

P.S.: When are they going to make GOOD film about Louis XVI?  I know I'm not the only one who thinks that would be interesting to see a decent film about him.",1161734400,2,4332,4.397243107769423
1580705,4,B00005JPAS,"Sophia Coppola is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors for her style is one all her own, and one that is so unique and revolutionary that it cowers over most directors today.  With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette.  Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between.  I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.

As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul.  When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France.  Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know.  The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all.  Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her.  Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.

Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution.  As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen.  She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.

`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her.  In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her.  This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution.  The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.

One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used.  Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained.  That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do.  It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation.  Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance.  Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy.  The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.

As a whole I was very impressed with this film.  Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully.  Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination.  Love it or hate it, `Marie Antoinette' is a one of a kind film that supports a revolutionary vision and serves us entertainment as sweet as pie...err cake.",1161561600,8,4543,4.583436341161928
1580706,4,B00005JPAS,"Ok, first of all... if you're a movie snob and don't know how to enjoy yourelf at the movies.. or enjoy yourself period, maybe this ain't the movie for you. This movie is a really fun, moving, refreshing, and original take on historical film/period pieces. I would say its more of a period piece. Sofia Coppola is a woman director and since we are used to seeing movies by men, this film may come as a surprise to most. She is amazing at conveying subtle emotions in a charmingly clever way. Marie Antoinette is practically a silent film, reducing the dialogue to an almost painful bare minimum, and it is what makes the movie stunning. Women see the world in a very different way than men, and this movie was clearly made to display an historical woman from a female emotional perspective. It reminds me of the Enlightenment classic ""Candide"" in the way it shows wonderful and atrocious things happening too nobles and commoners alike, and how the roles can be reversed at any time. The awful irony of life. In this way it does really portray ideas of the enlightenment. This film is a sensual ride upon Marie Antoinette's emotional wave, giving us a sensory glimpse into an 18th Century royal decadence that you can almost taste. It feels like a sin just to be watching such extravagent fun, not disimilar to the feeling I get while watching the bottle blonde babes of the Playboy Mansion delightfully frolic about on T.V.'s Girls Next Door. Someone else mentioned Laguna Beach, but the Laguna Beach income bracket isn't quite substantial enough to compare to living at the most spectacular Palace of all time, Versaille.  Hugh's empire is much closer, a seperate little world, where the best parties on the planet are thrown. It actually very much has that reality tv feel, but oh so much better, often you will find yourself watching Marie Antoinette do mundane activities but for some reason its entertaining because its Marie Antoinette. Can anyone say Paris Hilton? Squandering world-saving quantities of dough, trashed by the masses, but doesn't seem to even notice. I find it to be a Clueless meets Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet. It has the girls just wanna have fun appeal of Clueless, something you can only truly enjoy if you have a deep love of fashion, while delivering it via the scene and soundtrack of the ""tinge of melancholy"" joy ride of the youth extasy club culture.

1580707,5,B00005JPAS,"Booed at its Cannes premiere this year (as Anthony Lane in the ""New Yorker"" states: ""Who was in the audience, Robespierre?""), ""Marie Antoinette"" is that rare bird: a film that is beautiful on the outside (everything about the physical movie is eye-poppingly gorgeous: Costumes, Food, Pastries, Shoes {yes shoes...in fact I can't remember a film in recent memory of which almost every reviewer credits the shoes to the designer: in this case, Manolo Blahnik}) as it is on the inside: studiously, exhaustively researched, thoughtfully written and impeccably directed by Sofia Coppola who gives us a revisionist portrait of M. Antoinette that is humane, heartfelt and above all measured and compassionate. There is no doubt who is in charge of this huge production and Coppola's obvious tender touch is evident everywhere throughout this film.
This ""Marie Antoinette"" is told from a Marie as a girl perspective: she is very young, she is giddy, very much impatient of the French Court and it's customs, very much into clothes and shoes yet she matures, has children, takes a lover grows wise, becomes the subject of gossip, learns to love Louis and becomes a loving and doting mother. This is a fully fleshed out role of a victim, really: a victim of politics, of circumstances beyond her control.
At the center of this film is the tragic, sad and revelatory Marie of Kirsten Dunst. Dunst's Marie is the outsider, reviled by the French court (called ""L'Autrichienne"" by most...the Austrian *itch), lost and 14 when she first arrives in France, literally stripped of everything Austrian, Dunst navigates this difficult role with ease. But this is not a surface performance...not at all. Dunst digs deep and reveals all the nuances, all the insecurities, all the strengths of one of the most hated women in all of history. Dunst plays Marie from her gut and she leaves her blood as well as her tears on the celluloid. Do not be swayed or fooled by the naysayers: this is a towering performance of the first order.
Coppola is getting a lot of bad press or her use of 80's music on the soundtrack (Bow Wow Wow, Gang of 4, The Cure) but she has so far in her two previous films (""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"") proven to be nothing if not a populist, a product of her environment, a lover of popular culture. In ""M.A."" the music serves the story effectively by blasting away and preventing any cobwebs from growing on what could have been a stodgy Historical drama.
Though Coppola will not be beheaded for making this wonderful film, it is apparent that most people just don't get ""it.""  With all that said the fact remains: ""Marie Antoinette"" contains one of the most beautiful images ever committed to film: Marie in a carriage, having been forced out of Versailles, deep sadness in her face, clutching her children and holding Louis's hand, the camera pointed out at the grounds of Versailles, she poignantly says ""Goodbye"" to the only place she can claim as home...as the carriage takes her family to Oblivion.",1161475200,255,3023,4.858527131782946

1580750,5,B00005JPAS,"I saw Kirsten Dunst on one of the late night talk shows and she compared this film to a silent movie. The story is told mainly through visual cues and a great soundtrack as there is minimal dialogue.

I was wrapped up in the beautiful cinematography and outstanding performance by Kirsten Dunst. Jason Schwartzman was also very effective and amusing as the endearingly awkward Louis. The colors, costumes, sets and shots of Versailles are absolutely stunning. I especially enjoyed the scenes depicting Marie being subjected to the ridiculous and complex protocol of the French royal court; including one in which she is instructed that the person of highest rank present must dress her as she stands naked in front of a crowd in her bedroom.

This movie is a peek into what Marie Antoinette's life may have been like. It is a meandering, sympathetic look at the life of a young girl lost in a life frivolity and excess. Towards the end of the film we see Marie maturing somewhat as she becomes a devoted mother. However her utter ignorance of politics and of how she is percieved by the public doom her. The terrifying and sad scene of Marie & Louis under seige in their own palace as they sit in front of the usual opulent banquet strikingly depicts the end of an era.

Having read about and seen documentaries on Marie allowed me to better enjoy and understand this film as there is little historical backdrop provided. Also the end will really leave you hanging unless you are already well informed about Marie's tragic fate. If you aren't familiar with the history of the French Revolution and Marie Antoinette I suggest reading at least a little bit about the subject online before seeing the film.

This young producer uses sight and sound to appeal to our senses not our developed (or undeveloped) intellects.  This new trend in moviemaking has magnificent potential as 75 percent of our learning and understanding comes from seeing.  Only 25 percent from hearing.

Sparse dialog forces us to pay more attention to visual clues - a rotation of family portraits informs us that a child has died; a subtle glance at his wife apprises us the king is beginning to overcome his apprehension - and adds emphasis - advisors induce a naive king to send troops to America requiring an increase in taxes.

1580752,1,B00005JPAS,"After seeing the previews and hype surrounded by Sofia Coppola's new film, I could not wait for it to come out. However, after I left the movie theatre, I was honestly wishing that I had not wasted my time or money.

There are so many things wrong with the film Marie Antoinette that I hardly know where to begin. First, why in the world was Kirsten Dunst cast as the ill-fated queen? I don't believe that she is a bad actress, but she could do this role no justice; she is too modern and never seems to age throughout the entire movie. They should have gotten an actress who was a little older and more polished, such as Joely Richardson's portrayal in The Affair of the Necklace.

Second, no matter what excuses people may come up with, you cannot base an entire film around a historical event, particularly one such as the French Revolution, without providing some sort of historical context and background. This is possible without being a documentary--just look at the wonderful movies produced by the BBC and films such as Shekar Kapur's Elizabeth (though it was not entirely historically accurate). Marie Antoinette, on the other hand, gives us all fluff with no substance. Viewers get no idea of the political turmoil that is going on in France around this time, and just why exactly the French hate her. The abrupt end is even more ridiculous as the movie does not even show Marie and Louis XVI's tragic fates (they were beheaded and the monarchy abolished). For those who are not up on their history, they might wonder what exactly happened to them as they rode off in their carriage in the wind.

I understand that Coppola probably wanted to mainly show the decadence and selfishness of the Versailles court, but we do not have to keep being reminded of it through unnecessary scenes which serve no purpose but to highlight the excesses of the court. Because of this, the film is extremely slow-moving, and there were many times when I was outright bored (highly unusual since I have an alarmingly high attention-span).

I would strongly urge moviegoers not to waste their money on this dud; skip it and get the new PBS documentary and the 1938 film version with Norma Shearer. The only thing good I can say about this movie is that the costumes and sets are glorious; the food in it also looks delectable.

This movie claims it was based on the Antonia Fraser biography, but the only thing that could have been taken from it was its name.",1161388800,23,2450,4.635944700460829
1580753,5,B00005JPAS,"I'll start by saying that I am French, and that I have studied Marie Antoinette as part of the history curriculum.

To say this is a historical movie would be a mistake.  Then again...Yes, to the french, Marie Antoinette was seen as this heartless foreigner who, because of her extravagant spendings and way of life, doomed France and burned it to the ground, and that belief still stands today, that's still what's in the history books.  She is summed up with one sentence: ""Let them eat cake"", a phrase which she apparently muttered when she was told the population was starving and didn't have enough bread.

So it's no surprise this movie didn't go over too well with the french critics at Cannes, since here she is depicted as a lost teenage girl thrown into a world she wasn't prepared to enter and given responsibilites no 14 year old could ever deal with, notably saving the country from famine and war.

Personally, I loved this movie. But to appreciate it, you have to let go of that historical aspect, which Sofia Coppola helps with by putting history in the backseat for most of the movie.  There's some in the beginning, but the moment you fully realize that she is a historical figure in the movie is at the end.

It's really more a story about growing up, trying to find your place, feeling trapped and how to deal with that, and Kirsten Dunst portrays perfectly all those feelings, and she's very reacheable, and I identified so much with her, because you don't see her as royalty, just as a lost teenager.

Some might not like the movie because of its pace.  Yes, just as a warning, most of the movie is people sitting around, reading, listening to soft music, peacefully ""frolicking"" and rolling in high grass, waiting, and then comes sudden bursts of retro bubbly music that fits perfectly with the tone of the movie along with the parties and getting dressed up.

Personally, I wasn't bored once, I never looked at my watch, it's a movie that if you like this sort of movie (You could possibly find similarities with ""Pride and Prejudice"" from last year), then you'll be completely captivated.

The whole film is cast perfectly, and the soundtrack is just amazing, and if you got into the spirit of the movie, then the end, when you realize that she was actually a real person, and that she might not have been that heartless, just lost and too young, along with the hauntingly beautiful music (""Opus 36"" on the soundtrack), will pull at your heart strings.

It's definitely a movie that made me think about Marie Antoinette, and shows a different side of the story.  But you can't regard it as a historical piece, because that's not the focus of the movie.  I also thought that it completely surpassed ""Lost In Translation"".

It has become one of my favorite films, and I'll regard it as a masterpiece.  I fell in love with it as well as with its music.

It's a movie I whole-heartedly recommend.",1161388800,10,2917,4.611218568665377
1580754,5,B00005JPAS,"I adored this movie... i saw it at the beginning of the summer when it came out in Paris, then i saw it three more times. A lot of people have criticized this movie for being to fluffy, having no character development etc... I am a long time fan of Marie Antoinette and I loved that this movie portrayed her as a spoiled rotten queen, obsessed with clothes and bored to tears with her charmed life in her gilded cage because that is exactly what she was. Marie Antoinette was a child of privilege when she was sent to France to become Dauphine and eventually Queen. Upon arriving in France she was treated as an outcast, a delicate girl that no one expected to survive at Versailles. She was bored, unloved and given all the material wealth a person could want and never knew the value of money. She didn't understand that what she spent on a pair of shoes could feed a peasant family for months. While she eventually became a responsible, loving mother, the only things people remember about her are her extravagant fashions, lavish parties and expensive renovation projects. Kirsten Dunst does not age in this film which i think was a good move... as Marie Antoinette remained a young girl until her arrest at the age of 37. Her reality was a fantasy world and that was all she knew. This is also the point of view from which this film was written and i find absolutely brilliant.",1161388800,6,1382,4.488095238095238
1580755,2,B00005JPAS,"Imagine a movie about JFK that ignores the Cuban Missile Crisis, his assassination, every important speech he ever made and every decisive action he ever took, and instead focuses on backyard football games, quickie affairs and all the pills he chewed for his ailing back.

That's writer-director Sofia Coppola's take on the famously executed French queen  in ""Marie Antoinette."" Daring and defiant, it's gorgeous and entirely superficial. It'll bore and offend casual filmgoers as a monotonous, two-hour rock video void of spiritual and historical integrity.

But it's deliberately repetitive. It's deliberately vapid. Does that make it more essential art?

Some critics have argued just that, as Coppola's aim is to dissect the modern consumptive culture through the eyes of a queen who ruled France before she was 18, spent lavishly at her Versailles palace, and became the best-known victim of the French Revolution. She's a girl who wanted to have fun. Off with her head for it!

This Marie, played friskily by Kirsten Dunst, is more or less a clothes and jewelry hound who knows nothing of that impending doom. She's a party kid with a teenage husband who won`t touch her in bed. She's trapped in a royal court until she breaks away and strips off the corset for a certain Swedish count at her hideaway bungalow in the country.

Is that the real Marie? I don't think so, and neither did many of the French who lustily booed the movie at Cannes upon its premiere. Coppola is aiming for a ""Portrait of a Pop Culture Artist as a Young Queen."" What she produces is a lot closer to ""My Super Sweet Sixteen at Versailles.""

Coppola shoots montages of shoes, and cakes and fantastic wigs to the song ""I Want Candy."" She crafts a purposely unsophisticated screenplay that renders Marie California articulate. Her husband, king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) barely speaks at all. The drama is never underlined, peripheral characters emerge and disappear, and key events are MIA.

Is it crucial to depict the fallen queen's beheading? No. But The Affair of the Necklace, as it was called, represented a crucial shift in Marie's popularity with her people. It goes unmentioned. And the tragic part of Marie's story - her imprisonment after the fall of Versailles - is entirely absent.

In its place? Parties, drinking, sex, shopping, wide shots of the Versailles grounds, a segment in the country where Marie writhes around in the grass, more parties, drinking and gambling.

Director of photography Lance Acord, does a terrific job creating lush, moody visuals. And Dunst does her best to act the icon her director wishes her to be.

It's Coppola, coming off the terrific ""Lost In Translation,"" who's not up to it. Where is her ambition? ""Marie Antoinette"" unfolds as if she's afraid to take the woman head on in the epic her life deserves.  Instead of grandeur and scope, Coppola bangs around the halls of Versailles, puts on a shiny dress and calls it cute.

It smacks of fear. A modern art critic might argue ""Marie Antoinette"" is subverting the rules or channeling a fresh perspective. But historical rules and perspective are occasionally useful because they generally point toward the truth. This movie points to ""Laguna Beach.""",1161388800,5,3230,4.970315398886828
1580756,4,B00005JPAS,"There are actually several Marie Antoinette biographies out there that paint Marie Antoinette in a sympathetic light. This film is based on one of those biographies written by Antonia Fraser. But the film is by no means a faithful transcription of Fraser's biography to screen; in fact Antonia Fraser has gone on record as saying that the Marie Antoinette of Sofia Coppola's film is not the Marie Antoinette of her biography. What you get in Sofia Coppola's film is a character that is largely the product of Sofia Coppola's imagination which means among other things that this film is a very personal take on this historical figure.

At times it seems Sofia Coppola seems to want us to see her Marie Antoinette as a product of her cultural context but at other times it  seems that Coppola wants to radically decontextualize this figure and allow us to see that the distance between 18th century France and our cultural context is not that great. On the one hand we are invited to observe Marie Antoinette as she was put on display before the courts of her time and on the other hand we are invited to see Marie Antoinette with her gaurd down behind the scenes in the personal space of her bedroom. While most people will not be able to relate with Marie Antoinette's royal upbringing and lifestyle most people will be able to relate with the fact that there is a great distance between Marie Antoinette's public and private lives because all of us have at one time or another felt the great disparity that exists between social formalities and decorums and our natural selves. Most of us treasure our privacy and value time spent alone as the most important time of the day but Marie Antoinette is caught in a world where she has virtually no privacy. In fact her most private moments are what interest the court and the public the most. Hence her private life is not really private at all. Being deprived of personal space at a time in her life when she needs it the most (early teen years) is something that Marie Antoinette never gets used to and even if we can't relate to every aspect of her life we can certainly relate to this. There are really several moments in Marie Antoinette's life that are presented in ways that allow us to identify with her: her search for a confidante, her wish to express her own identity, her first feelings of love. By focusing less on Marie Antoinette the royal and more on Marie Antoinette the teen Sofia Coppola offers her audience a figure that they can relate with and even like. As personable as this character is, however, we are only allowed a very limited access to her. Though we see her in her private rooms all that we know of Marie Antoinette in this film is based on surfaces and appearances and appearances are always vague, always enigmatic.

Certainly few films have been so thoroughly dedicated to the purely visual as Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Filmgoers looking for a compelling plot or character might be nonplussed by this extravagantly realized piece of visual art that shuns the usual narrative strategies of the film biography. Though we catch fleeting glimpses of Marie Antoinette both in public and in private we are kept at a distance from the real dramas that are affecting her life. On one occasion we do see her break down after visiting her brother-in-laws newborn and are thus given a glimpse of the pain she feels at not yet having conceived a child of her own but these candid moments are rare. The film does not have a lot of dialogue and we are never really allowed into Marie Antoinette's thought process. Also the film does not proceed along any particular narrative line; instead it moves in a rather impressionistic way from one thing to the next and one time span to the next, sometimes without any sort of transition, and thus theres not a lot of connective tissue linking the various scenes together. One of the advantages of this compelling near-silent anti-narrative approach is that Sofia Coppola is free to craft a portrait based not on the usual accumulation of scenes that dramatize what we already know from the historical record and existing biographical data but on an accumulation of isolated vignettes. Each vignette presents us with another angle from which to view the enigma that is Marie Antoinette even though none of these visual cues supply us with any concrete or definitive answers as to who she is. The resulting film is thus less a literal rendering of a life than an open-ended evocation. As a result it is a much freer kind of biography; one might even call it an anti-biography because the person being studied remains a mystery for the most part. This film is not for the literal minded but for those who enjoy the enigma of surfaces. This film, like the paintings of Velazquez, or Goya, or Manet offer rich but elusive surfaces to the eye; Marie Antoinette, like the faces in these paintings, looks straight at us but tells us virtually nothing or at least tells us nothing in a literal way. With Marie Antoinette Sofia Coppola is experimenting with film as a purely visual medium instead of as a medium that relies on familiar narrative forms and she effectively uses this experimental anti-narrative technique to offer a Marie Antoinette that does not fit into any of the narratives that have been told about her.

  This film experiments with style and invites us to examine style as an alternative language--a language of appearances--that disrupts the usual narrative forms that cinema is so fond of. If you leave behind your usual need to follow a traditional narrative and find literal meanings and allow yourself to simply gaze upon this films many polyvalent surfaces then you will be in a position to appreciate this films original approach which does not attempt to capture Marie Antionette by defining her but shows her time and again attempting to elude her captors.",1161388800,83,5896,4.741715399610136
1580757,1,B00005JPAS,"Leave this silly music video alone, and RUN purchase the extraordinary, and just released, 1938 film with Norma Shearer as the French queen. If you want to know where Meryl Streep got her acting technique from, watch Shearer. Yes, there are moments, mostly when she's required to 'enter' a scene, when she's over-directed - but one must remember this was almost seventy years ago, and talkies were only a decade old. The majority of her screen time is a master class for film actors: her choices are stunningly complex yet exquistely simple and truthful. They will leave you, literally, momentarily breathless. It is difficult to grasp, by the end of the movie, that the actor playing the young Hapsburg princess is the same actor awaiting execution. One knows it's Norma Shearer, but she somehow has actually aged before our eyes, without the help of heavy makeup or props. The journey from Vienna to Versailles, to the Conciergerie to the Place de la Concorde is made by an actor whose ability to show her character's soul transforming, moment to terrible moment, defies comparison or explanation.  The sole performance which comes close to this is perhaps Vivien Leigh's in STREETCAR, but that would come nearly twenty years later and even it, like much of Streep's work, seems 'mannered' when referencing Shearer's Marie.

The film is a wonder of imagery and restrained scoring - and the DVD transfer immaculate. The supporting cast, with the exception of a beautiful but rather wooden young Tyrone Power, is a dream. The discreet scale of the sets and the luminous costumes make the point that we are in another world, without overpowering us - the way the modern film does. This is also thanks to the extraordinary power of silver nitrate film stock, which has never been equaled since - in color or black and white. The script is poignant, smart and brutally honest.

Every actor, desiring to work in film, should buy this to study Shearer's seemless work. Every lover of history should purchase this for the remarkable job it does shedding intimate light on such a chaotic time. Every movie collector must own this DVD, for it contains - at its incandescent center - one of the greatest renderings of a human being's frailty, strength and suffering.",1161216000,14,2257,4.903141361256544

The majority of the film is just the royalty laying around, eating, gambling, etc. The acting was on par with a high school play. The script was awful. I cannot understand why so much time with repetitious scenes and yet not cover her pregnancies or the death of two young children, not just one. Another thing that drove me nuts is the modern music. Nothing ruins a historical movie more than modern music.
