8259495,4,B0015R31YY,"Rather than the typical ""2 people died in Iraq today"", this video gives you part of the who, what, where, when, why, how that our media seems to be uninterested in.  I especially enjoyed the interviews and learning who these amazing men are who are serving us so well.  We hear in their own words why they have volunteered and what they feel they are accomplishing.  Seeing the Iraqi people through the eyes of our soldiers is refreshing, as well.

I really enjoyed the video and am glad to be able to support those who are trying to present the news our media doesn't care to show us.",1211846400,,585,4.388888888888889
8259496,3,B0015R31YY,"Much as I'd love to heap praise on this product I'd say you're better off reading the blogs by Michael Totten & Michael Yon about Iraq.  These documentaries do, however, make for an interesting supplement.  My gratitude to JD Johannes for creating them.",1210464000,,253,4.8604651162790695
8259497,5,B0015R31YY,"For those who seek information about what we face in Iraq, and are not willing to take what the mainstream press says at face value, I recommend this DVD set. Recorded live, including combat action, this documentary gives you first hand knowledge of the challenging issues we face such as frustrating blood feuds that stymie progress; the calm professionalism displayed by military management while under duress and the psychology of working with a culture so different from our own. I plan on watching this documentary again to learn even more. Michael Moore could take a lesson here.",1208822400,2,585,5.041237113402062
8259498,5,B0015R31YY,"Without question, this is one of the best documentaries about the Iraq war that I have seen yet.  This is a ""must see"". In three parts, Johannes lays out the ""three block war"" and brings the real war out of the darkness of two minute clips from the nightly news or two paragraphs in the news paper to eye catching film.

From actual battle footage, to interviews of soldiers and Iraqi citizens, this brings the battle for Iraq right into the viewer's home.  It shows just how difficult a job it is to fight bad men, reconcile a population and reconstruct a nation.  It also shows the kind of people that are doing it and their dedication to making their mission successful.

All three sections of the documentary are excellent.  I would say that, while section one had some heart stopping battle scenes, it was section two and three that got my attention the most.  Section 2 ""Anbar"" shows the Iraqis explaining what happened when al Qaida had come to their village and why they decided to fight them.  This is no propaganda, but the reality of villages everywhere in Iraq and across the globe that are exposed to extremist Islam.  Even the most conservative of villages can never meet Al Qaida's exacting standards, giving them ample reasons within Al Qaida's ""rule of law"" to inflict tyranny, torture and death on anyone that crosses their path.

Part three ""the surge"" really showed what actual counter-insurgency warfare is; it's barely ""war"" as we think it.  It could be called ""extreme negotiations"" or ""Iraq Apprentice"" where instead of being ""fired"" for making a mistake negotiating the stormy waters of political, sectarian and commercial interests, someone could and sometimes does die for it.  The extreme difficulty of this job is the responsibility of soldiers of every rank and they act as the unofficial ""armed state department"".  It was truly amazing what they did in a single day.  They accomplish more in a day than most people do in a week or a month.

Get this DVD!  You will not regret it.  I also recommend this DVD to anyone who is in the military or will be deploying.  All three sections have crucial information that will prepare deploying individuals and units for the experience of going to battle in Iraq.",1208822400,5,2234,4.743523316062176
