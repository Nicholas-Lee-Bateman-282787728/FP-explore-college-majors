6590434,5,B00MNS2OJ2,I got this for a gift and I like this movie. It is a great movie and with it having both of the two movies on it is great.,1426032000,,122,3.2413793103448274
6590435,5,B00MNS2OJ2,Love these movies. Michael Pare (aka Eddie Wilson) did an amazing job.,1423958400,2,70,4.916666666666667
6590436,5,B00MNS2OJ2,Great movie and the music is AWESOME! Got this for my dad for Christmas since he has a VHS-recorded copy of these movies and it was about time to have a clearer and better copy.,1420934400,,177,4.085714285714285
6590437,5,B00MNS2OJ2,"It's Eddie and The Cruisers....... Nothing else to say. Both are great movies,  good music.",1420416000,,91,5.066666666666666
6590438,4,B00MNS2OJ2,"I only give this 4 stars because some production values might have been better.  That said, these two Eddie and the Cruisers films are great undiscovered gems.  Michael Pare, Tom Berenger, Ellen Barkin and Joe Pantoliano at the start of their acting careers?  Gems.  But the best part is the music.  John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band wrote and performed almost every song in both films, and this kickin' bar band is still on the road today.  In fact, we just saw them last weekend at Magic City Casino and they rocked the house... and the house next door!  Sax player Michael ""Tunes"" Antunes does double duty, playing the onscreen role of Wendell Newton, and playing to perfection onstage.  If you love rock, original composers, gracious, warm people, and pure heart, then Eddie and the Cruisers AND John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band should be at the top of your list.",1417305600,9,880,4.705882352941177
