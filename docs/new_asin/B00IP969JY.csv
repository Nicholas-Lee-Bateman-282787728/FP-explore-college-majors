6284700,5,B00IP969JY,Ignore the other reviews. The set is not colorized. The final season of Rawhide was s*** in color. The other six seasons are in glorious black and white from pristine MGM prints. The series looks better than it ever did on my dad's old Zenith.,1425859200,22,243,4.4222222222222225

6284703,5,B00IP969JY,"This series is a true classic. This show features Cowboys in their truest form, no dilution or distortion here. Beyond the machismo of the average western, Rawhide is really a well written show with great characters, and a true human message in every episode. Having the most iconic opening song, which has been covered by musicians from The Dead Kennedy's to the Blues Brothers, really completes the series. The show has all the original music intact. Clint Eastwood is very young, and while a main character, is not THE main character, despite his picture being biggest on the box. The quality of these DVDs is very good, but I AM excited about the new 59 disc box set coming out this year (2015) either way, this is the BEST western ever made, and a great place to start a western collection.",1425254400,6,795,4.6453900709219855

6284716,5,B00IP969JY,"Of course who doesn't love Clint Eastwood. But I gottta love Eric Flemming as Gil Favor, the trail boss. If you love horse and cattle, seasons 1-3 are the best. Season 4 gets off track away from hense the title Rawhide. Season 5 -6 gets back into it. Season 7 repeat that aired. season 8 Clint is the trail boss , the only people left in series is Wishbone and Quince. The other hired hands are all new. The show was at its end where Eastwood wanted out, Flemming was gone, and an augument broke out with company causing Mushy and Scarlet to quit. Shep Wooley left in 4th season. All in all its still a great western collection to have. And for Eastwood fans you see him in his prime. And physically watch before your eyes turn into the man with no name.

The Complete Series Pack is a nice set to own. Each Season in its own original packaging. The price was right. (89.99) Paramount did a great job restoring these.

EDIT: Part of Season 4 doesn't seem to be restored? It is watchable, picture quality seems to improve somewhat throughout the episodes. Also that is the start of  SUBTITLES being implemented instead of Closed Caption.",1482537600,,555,6.788732394366197
6284752,5,B00IP969JY,"Just as good as I remember from it when I watched it as a kid/teenager.  It's really bad though that they package it as Clint Eastwood's show - he played a key part, but the star - the late great Eric Fleming - should be on the cover, along with Paul Brinegar too. Good visual and sound quality and a joy to watch.",1482019200,3,314,3.984126984126984
6284753,5,B00IP969JY,"Eric Fleming was the star and he did a great job as Gil Favor. His face should be prominent there.  When he left, it was unbearable to watch.

6284772,5,B00IP969JY,"I was watching a Sergio Leone ""spaghetti western"" recently with my adult son and we got into discussing the television series ""Rawhide"".  I told my son that a lot of my pre-teen/teenaged friends (the show was on seven seasons!) had crushes on Rowdy Yates [Clint Eastwood].  For me, I had a mad crush on the trail boss, Gil Favor [Eric Fleming].  The whole family watched ""Rawhide"" and I can still hear my Mom kidding about how a cattle drive crossing our vast plains could keep running into people wandering the priarie or get ensnared in town-folk's issues.  I personally loved how Gil Favor always just wanted to keep the herd moving, but STILL got took the time to solve whatever problem.  An episode almost never included Favor not pounding a crudely made cross over a grave - the episode's ""red shirt"" on the show would invariably be a newly hired drover, or a female who looked to be a serious love-interest of Favor or Yates.  Recall loving episodes that included scout Nolan [Shep Wooley] singing.  Well, my son purchased the Complete Series for me in mid-March and I am in Season #3 now and profoundly enjoying watching the show again.  Wonderful to see the likes of Tom Conroy, Cloris Leachman, Jack Jensen, John Marley, Peter Lorre, Barry Fitzgerald, Anne Francis, Victor McLaughlin, Elisha Cook, Jr., Caesar Romaro, Leonard Nimoy ......and a myriad of other stars of the big and small screens.

What fun that was and the westerns back then made us wish we were grown up and riding along the trail with all the dogies. I am now 66 and just started watching Season 1 and so far I am very impressed with the clarity of each of the episodes. Guess the old TV sets made the show look a bit grainy. I have no complaints so far and am enjoying watching and reliving old memories of bygone days; and yes, I am still singing along to ""Rawhide"" with each episode.

6284798,3,B00IP969JY,"An excellent series in 3 plastic clam shell mega-Amaray packs, which are together in a cardboard housing that contains all 217 episodes from 8 seasons (January 9, 1959-December 7, 1965). Each case holds 2 or 3 seasons, with a disc on either side of a plastic page. These pages protect each disc, while making them accessible, by flipping, like pages in a book. Episode titles are listed on the discs, and can also be cross referenced with titles and air dates listed by season on the inside covers of each Amaray pack. Lots of content packed into a small space. One problem is that these pages are not anchored to the inside of the cases. If you opened the clam shell without knowing this, the pages holding 20 DVD's, which are hinged together at the base, could slide out and fall to the floor. I've deducted one star off for this, and one for the poor quality of season 4, which was unremastered, both for it's original release and for this set. In another situation, CBS remastered season 10 of Hawaii 5-0 after complaints from buyers. This packaging should have also pictured Eric Fleming (Gil Favor), the series star for 7 seasons",1434844800,59,1135,4.623762376237623

6284804,5,B00IP969JY,"Lots of DVDs for the price. Great photography for series in Black and White. Many familiar faces, actors who played character bits on various TV shows, and then may have come into their own. Buddy Ebsen, Claude Atkins come to mind. The cattle scenes at the beginning of each episode
are varied and interesting. Writing runs from great to typical TV of the 1960's topics. Fun to see Eastwood at the beginning of his careers, sad to see Eric Flemings' potential knowing that he died far too young.",1433635200,16,495,4.636363636363637
