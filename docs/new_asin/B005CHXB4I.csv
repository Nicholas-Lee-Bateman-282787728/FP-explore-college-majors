4653389,5,B005CHXB4I,"I've seen a number of negative comments and can only wonder if the reviewers expected a film maker to follow the reviewers' exact image of what the movie should be.  When you consider the size of the studio and that this was their first endeavor, I think it's quite good.  The Ultramarines aren't my favorite chapter, and I too would love to see a large scale battle with hundreds of enemy and a larger unit of Space Marines, but for what it was, I think it was an excellent start and I dearly hope they will continue to produce more episodes from the 40k universe in the future.  I also like that there is a market for smaller studios.  I don't want everything I see and buy to benefit some conglomerate such as SXny that will only mass market things for the popular mass market while avoiding genre niches which is surely what Warhammer 40k is.  To see the miniatures brought to life on the TV screen was very rewarding for me, and I can easily recommend this product to any Warhammer 40k enthusiast, which is the audience the producers targeted as if by auspex.",1320969600,4,1064,4.435897435897436
4653390,1,B005CHXB4I,"This review is bound to inflame other Warhammer 40,000 fans but I feel like I would betraying the franchise not to express my opinion. The Ultramarines movie was a big step for the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and it generated a lot of excitement. When I found out about the movie I was ecstatic. At one point in time I even had the special edition box set pre-ordered from the official website. Fortunately for me funds ran low and I wasn't able to make the purchase. A month later I watched the movie with a friend who had gotten the movie and I couldn't have been more disappointed.

A lot of the excitement around the Ultramarines Movie project came from the announcement that mega author Dan Abnett would be writing the screenplay. First let me say that I have nothing but respect for Dan Abnett. I cannot name a single Warhammer 40,000 book he has written that I have not enjoyed completely. And I've read them all. Dan Abnett is by far the best author in the ranks of the Black Library publishing company and if there was ever anyone who could write the script for a 40K movie it would be him. That said, I'd like to believe that Abnett never even touched the script. There is no depth to the plot. None whatsoever. My guess is that Abnett jokingly handed the Ultramarines Movie staff a couple sentences scribbled on a restaurant napkin and told them to run with it. And they did.

The plot of the Ultramarines movie is thin, watery, and linear. A squad of Ultramarines (don't expect them to remember their names or faces) travel to a desolate world to relieve a beleaguered force of Imperial Fists. Once upon the planet the squad walks for a bit, bickers back and forth like school kids, walks for a bit more, bickers, walks, bickers, walks...you get my drift. The dialogue is laughable though the voice acting is very well done. The Ultramarines do not act anything like the Ultramarines depicted in 40K fiction. Their enemies, the Black Legion behave more like Khorne beserkers than the cunning remnant of Horus Lupercal's sons. The characters are so flat and interchangeable that you won't really be sure who died when. The twists aren't at all twisty. The character models are ugly and muddled as are the backgrounds and set pieces. The architecture doesn't come close to resembling the gothic style of the fiction. The action is bland and boring. I really can't find enough bad things to say about the movie.

This is one of those movies that people say, ""For fans only."" But in all honesty, fans of 40K need to stay way clear of the Ultramarines Movie. I hope I didn't offend anyone, this is after all just my opinion. But the truth is that this is a very bleak omen that lessens the possibilities of a REAL 40K movie down the road.",1319846400,187,2744,4.561866125760649
4653391,5,B005CHXB4I,This movie was perfect as far and getting the feel for the warhammer game. I really enjoyed it and  hope there will be more in the furture. Iwould recomind this to any one that likes sci-fi or the warhammer game,1319587200,2,211,4.275
4653392,1,B005CHXB4I,"Well as a Warhammer 40k from day one fan and someone how hates anything except rogue Trader rule book found this movie painful to watch. A little group of guys slaughter hordes of chaos marines? The guy doesn't  know that most of the older chaos marines are thousands of years old and from the first founding , unlike most of the younger Ultra Marines in the film these guys have centuries of combat experiance and shouldn't be slaughtered off like some Star Trek red coats. The animamation is pretty bad as well. I better stop this review before i go into a 100 page rant on why this movie blows.",1319155200,7,597,4.427272727272728
4653393,1,B005CHXB4I,"I have been playing / collecting WH40k for 23 years and I have read all the books....I really find it hard to believe Dan Abenet wrote the script I think he just wrote the name of the movie on a piece of paper and some one else wrote it. Dan is a GREAT Author and his name on it is what sold the movie. The animation was really bad and jerky the Dawn of War trailers were 1000% better than this movie. I went to the New York City showing of this movie on the big screen and it was even more horrible to watch. During the Q&A after the movie the producer admitted to not knowing anything about 40K saying ""well I may have painted 1 or 2 figurines for my brother when I was younger but I never played the game and I have not read any of the novels."" OOOOO KAY buddy no wonder this movie is horrible because the guy had no love nor passion for the game and its history he was just out to make a quick buck.",1319068800,53,903,3.9130434782608696

I have always wanted to see a full length movie with some of the 40k characters, but this movie was horrible. Animation, horrible. Plot, horrible. Feasibility, horrible. Characters, horribly two dimensional. Ability to follow ANYTHING put forth in the warhammer40k ""world"" (besides a few names)--- ZERO. Half the movie is a bunch of Ultramarine waling around, and they get winded everytime they go up stairs. I don't even do that. A little piece of me died after watching this.

4653396,4,B005CHXB4I,"Pretty entertaining Warhammer 40k movie, even if the Ultramarines are way too impressed with themselves. :D",1458432000,,107,5.75
4653397,2,B005CHXB4I,"The only reason I give it a second star is because Dan Abnett knows how to write a good story. You should not, however, take that to mean that the makers of this movie do a good job of telling the story Abnett wrote.

The fan film Damnatus is much better.

Really, this movie is awful. The animation is poorly done. The marines walk like they are feather-light, not like huge dudes in power armor. The staging of the scenes is terrible. There is a ""last-stand"" style fight where a group of guys stand practically shoulder-to shoulder and the enemy converging on them from all sides seem unable to hit them. When they do hit someone, the same guy gets hit numerous times, while the guys standing near him are untouched. Also, this group of marines are shamefully stupid about combat, not one of them has heard of taking cover from enemy fire.
The characters are mostly very difficult to tell apart from one another, which makes an otherwise reasonably decent underlying story an incoherent mess. There are some distinguishing features from one character to the next, but they are mostly not prominent, and often out of shot.
The voice acting is passable, but, again, the voices are mostly too similar to make characters distinct from one another.
Several times I found myself pausing the movie so the timer would come up and I could tell how much more I would have to sit through.

The opening cinematic from the Warhammer 40K Dawn of War video game is prettier, more entertaining, and more inspiring than this entire movie.

As I write this, Amazon is offering me ""up to"" 66 cents for my used copy, but I just can't see it being ethical of me to rip them off like that.",1455235200,6,1669,4.553333333333334
4653398,5,B005CHXB4I,"I own the blu-ray and I probably re-watch at least once every three or four months. That is how much I love this movie.

The actual animation is nothing to write home about but it's solid enough to set the approprpiate tone for the exceedingly dark story. Where Ultramarines really shines though is in the voice acting. The performances are top notch and are as good as anything you will find out there. If you are a casual 40k fan I recommend at least a rent and if you are a die hard 40k fan I would highly recommend buying it,  IF you can find it.",1454803200,2,550,4.179245283018868
4653399,4,B005CHXB4I,"I just finished watching this, and while it didn't blow me away it was a good enough Space Marines movie, having never been done before.

Story: the story is original, not adapted from existing material, and written by Dan Abnett.  Abnett is a flagship author for 40K fiction; while Space Marines aren't his specialty, he's written a decent grim-dark mission with a few shocks and scares.  It's a bit slow-paced at times when the tension is building, but didn't feel overly drawn-out to me.  Though they give a brief intro, I think you're going to be rather lost if you're not familiar with 40K.  My husband was drawn in but kept asking questions.

Action: good battles & combats, each one different, but perhaps could have had more.  Especially, I expected more gore.  No need to stick to an R-rating when this wasn't intended for the mass market or wide theater distribution.

Animation: Ok, with a lot of detail in the Marines' gear and ship.  The facial motion capture succeeded on some levels, but this is nowhere near Lord of the Rings or Starcraft 2 cutscene quality.  The planet is mostly barren desert with dust storms, which were well done but not very interesting to look at after a while.  There are some great ""bullet time"" moments, close-ups, Marine's-eye-views, and creative shot angles.  I watched it on a monitor screen, which I know didn't do the visuals justice.

Characters: Dan Abnett's characters are usually more colorful, but again he's not best-known for his Space Marines, and we don't get the benefit of the depth one would get from reading vs watching.  The newly promoted Marines are not fully matured, eager to prove themselves, and there is much jockeying and boundary-testing.  This is well-written and voice-acted, but somewhat undermined by my difficulty telling them apart visually on a small screen.  Really should watch again someday on a large TV.  Captain Severus appears not to be Severus Agemman from Ultramarines fiction.

Throwing on an extra star for the extra content and special edition packaging.",1453161600,,2043,4.93841642228739

4653406,3,B005CHXB4I,"Weeeeeell...I'm a bit conflicted on this movie.  It's cool to see a Warhammer 40K movie, and it's good enough to rent, but it doesn't really adhere to an accurate portrayal of the 40K universe.  The movie is basically like any standard ""Army Action"" movie - a squad of good guys who end up getting into fights with the bad guys and - major spolier alert - the good guys win.  Outside of that, the writers of the movie said ""OK...let's make this action movie with WARHAMMER 40K STUFF!!!  That'll make it super good, right??!?!""  If you don't follow Warhammer 40K at all, it would mean that you'd be watching a somewhat poorly animated CG action movie.  If you do follow Warhammer 40K, you end up feeling like this movie has almost nothing to do with the feel of WH40K.  It follows a squad of Space Marines - Ultramarines, nonetheless - in Terminator suits on a mission.  The 'good guys' even include a Chaplain, but they all have personalities like regular scrubs in any other action movie.  Ultramarines in terminator armor are some of the most hardcore fighters in WH40K - they fight mercilessly to the death - but that's not at all what these guys act like.

If you're a fanboy (like me...), you know you're gonna watch this movie sooner or later.  Unfortunately, when you do, you're gonna end up with a ""Meh"" taste in your mouth, so save this for a rainy day when you don't have anything better to do.",1447200000,2,1404,4.509881422924901
4653407,4,B005CHXB4I,It's a good movie for Warhammer fans.  We don't have many choices so we have to appreciate what we get.,1445472000,,103,4.15
4653408,1,B005CHXB4I,"I have played Warhammer 40K for almost 20 years now. I have read the fiction, kept up with the changes in play style, collected thousands of dollars worth of mini's, and I was so excited to see that a full length movie was being released featuring my favorite chapter of Space Marines; The Ultramarines.
Let me start off by saying, this movie is as low budget as it gets. It pains me to think that this may be the reason that Games Workshop never makes another film, because its just that horrible. The plot line is nonexistent, the characters are wooden and immature, and the only worthwhile piece of dialogue is the Chaplain of the Imperial Fists screaming, 'Burn, Heretic!'
I love most of the voice actors, but the constant childish bickering between the Space Marines is obnoxious. The Ultramarines are the paradigm of humanity, and they walk around jockeying for position like high school football hooligans.
This movie had great potential with the cast they selected, and I feel that it was wasted by hollow dialogue and little to know visual stimuli.
I hope and pray that Games Workshop does produce a worthwhile film, because in all honesty, there is nothing I want more out of life. That's sad I know.
Please don't take offense to this review, it is honestly being typed out of anger after seeing this movie for the first time.",1445385600,5,1336,4.68936170212766

I am reading the first Ultramarine novel ""Nightbringer"" right now, and I have read 3 novellas as well.  I will watch this movie a couple more times.  Not the best, but it was fun.",1439164800,,287,4.163636363636364

4653412,3,B005CHXB4I,"So, I'm not a big WarHammer fan but I am a pretty devout fan of sci-fi. So, that being said I didn't hate it because it wasn't up to WarHammer standards, or love it ""'cuz WARHAMMER!"".  This movie entertained me, it wasn't the best animation I've seen, or the best story, the action scenes seemed appropriately action'y, the characters seemed a little hollow, and the bits in between the action'y bits seemed a little slow going (possibly intentionally for effect?). All in all this staved off boredom for the past hour or so and was fun but I think the $3.99 was a bit much to pay for the rental and would definitely preferred to have paid $1.99 or so for it (especially since Amazon didn't seem to consider my Windows 7 connection through HDMI cable to an LED flatscreen to be a secure enough connection to allow me to get the HD content I paid for...Buut, that's not the movies fault so the title lost no stars due to it). So yeah, if you're running out of new stuff to stream, this might get you there, and if you can't not love things ""'cuz WARHAMMER"" what the hell are you waiting for? But if you're not a dedicated fan and have another option you'd like to check out, or ARE a dedicated fan and something like this will just make you want to punch yourself in the face then I'd hold off...cheers!",1437868800,2,1302,4.3580246913580245

4653414,5,B005CHXB4I,Overall any Warhammer 40k fan will find this movie highly enjoyable. The film will help bring the black library novels and miniature game to a visual realism.

4653417,1,B005CHXB4I,"A complete waste of time and money.
You're better off playing the excellent Space Marine game or just rewatching the intro to Dawn of War. This movie looks like it was produced around 20 years ago, maybe while Transformers: Beast Wars was in full production. Ridiculously low budget, horribly paced and so far from the original source material it shames me to say I purchased the collector's set on a whim at ""yellow and blue"" store for $10. At least I now have a nice tin and box for my Space Marine game.

Really, can anyone believe these are the Champions of Earth when they have less skills than Cameron's motley Colonial Marines from Aliens? These Ultramarines are supposed to be equipped with the best tech, yet can't even handle a friggin' flashlight. So incredibly weak and infuriating, I can't believe Games Workshop could put it's stamp of approval on the packaging.

4653420,3,B005CHXB4I,"""Ultramarines"" is a decent enough movie, if you view it fairly.

It's true that the quality of the visuals are not on par with other CGI animated features, but that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. This isn't a major studio project with a $75 million production budget.

The voice cast is excellent, and features a few well known screen actors. The story is simple but works fine, and at just under 80 minutes in length, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. Whatever shortcomings the film has, I found it successfully achieved the tone of Warhammer 40k. It's likely only a matter of time before 40k gets the big-budget screen treatment.

Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie

***

Behold the Reelworm! Where the Culture dives into the world of the Big Screen and reviews the various stories told among the cinema.

Let us begin the journey with Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40000 Movie.

The Story: Captain Severus of the Ultramarines Chapter receives a distress signal from the Imperial Fists on the planet Mithron. Severus, responds taking a only ten-man squad of newly promoted Astartes, leaving the bulk of his company on Algol, to continue the bitter campaign against the scourge of Tyranids. On the merciless surface of the red planet, Ultima Squad discovers the aftermath of wretched battle. Mithron's Imperial shrine has been desecrated, and abominable atrocities unleashed.

The Good: What is good about this movie is the fact is that it allows fans of Warhammer 40000 to see, for lack of a better term, real-live Space Marines, when most of the time we are forced to only visualize epic battles of the Adeptus Astartes. The same goes for the world as well. Its very nice to see a visualization of the Warhammer 40k universe such as strike cruisers, Thunderhawks, and servitors, all being rendered in detail.

For a universe known for its guts and glory themes, a lot the story is very ambient. There is a great deal of atmosphere on the planet and it does a good job of building up the suspense and dread as the Ultramarines squad marches through the desolate landscape. It does make the viewer eager for what happens next.

The voice acting is hit and miss but on the perks of this movie John Hurts character of Karnak the Chaplain of the Imperial Fists. Reelworm has little experience with John Hurt, but in what has been seen, he has been superb. He is one of those people who just has an awesome voice. There is just this presence about him, like a old oak tree or a cliff, a sure and steady figure with great strength lurking beneath the surface. He fits the profile a grizzled Astartes Chaplain perfectly. Reelworm hopes that the lackluster response to the film has dampened his spirits to Warhammer 40k in the future.

The Flaws: The biggest flaw of this film is in its presentation. The computer generated imagery, while impressive on a few occasions, is very limited in many others. This film was made in 2010, the same years that the computer animated show, Transformers Prime, debut but it looks more like the Reboot cartoon of the late nineties. It is reasonable to assume that Games Workshop did not have the highest budget when creating this film, but it if that indeed was the case then they should have gone a different direction and made the whole film look more cartoony than the uncanny valley realism of its current form. Ironically, the Space Marines look more life-like with their faceless helmets on rather than off. In the endthe studio tried too hard to make it real.

While not known for their deep and complex personalities, the Space Marines are very much blank slates in regards to their characters which is to the storys detriment. Most of the squad are pure redshirt material. Only there to be killed off. One or two characters are interesting but even then we are not treating to great deal of time exploring their characters. It creates a very simplistic story that is more boring than entertaining. Most viewers would fast forward through any dialogue scenes to get straight to the action.

It should no surprise that Karnak is the only character that Reelworm can recall with any clarity and it is probably more due to John Hurt than anything else.

As mentioned above, a strength of this film is the atmosphere but it backfires in several places as it takes a long time to build up the plot but the execution is poorlywellexecuted. Too much is crammed into the last act and it is not even all that good. For any fan of Warhammer, its primary audience, the whole climax is pretty predictable.

Final Verdict: If you are a fan of Warhammer 40k, check it out because a few parts are kind of cool, but if you want a better version of real life Space Marines with a better story and visuals, check out a play through of the Space Marine Video Game.

Two out of Five Stars.

4653446,3,B005CHXB4I,"If, and I me IF, you just want to see the Ultramarines somewhere other than the games or books, then you'll be happy with this film.  First the good, I really enjoyed the voice work of the actors.  Although their lines weren't always the greatest they were delivered in a very enjoyable and believable way.  Each voice seemed to fit the character well and none seemed out of place or poorly cast.  Now the bad: If you're even a minimal fan of animated movies (especially of the Pixar and Dreamworks quality) then you'll be very, very disappointed in the film.  It was patently obvious when and where time was taken for attention to detail (closeups of the armor are outstanding) and where it was not (surrounding scenery).  Too much is shrouded in dust and darkness and all I could think during the film was ""I can see where they cut corners here...and here...and here.""  The story itself is ok, but it's not all that memorable.  And the twists, as other reviewers have said, are so obvious that they're not really twists at all.

Still, I would recommend watching, though not necessarily purchasing, the film.  I didn't feel as though the 75 minutes I spent viewing it were wasted, but it is one of those films that I just felt could, and should, have been better.",1404864000,,1265,4.582222222222223

The CGI was average, and the story had a good plot, but I thought the end could have been a little more exciting.  I think lots of fans that gave poor ratings were expecting a James Cameron production, but it is what it is. It's definitely worth the $3.99 rental, check it out. Sarge",1392249600,2,445,4.55
4653455,4,B005CHXB4I,"I liked this movie.  I think the Warhammer 40k purists are NUTS.  They remind me of the often bizarre Lord of the Rings purists who complained endlessly that the movies weren't 100% accurate with the books.  -- eyes rolling --  For the record, I have read 8 different 40k novels, own several audio books, and even played the game a years back.  I know a lot about Warhammer 40K.  If you are one of the rigid purists who demand absolute book accuracy, then you are going to be disappointed a bit.  Yes, it does have some plot holes, but I didn't care.  I thought it was very entertaining.  I thought the movie captured perfectly the look and feel of 40K along with the personality of the Space Marines.  The animation was crisp.  The sound effects were terrific and the story was decent.  I think it is a great first step and hopefully the beginning of many future 40K movies.  Let the 40k nuts fold their arms and pout, while the rest of us enjoy some entertaining Space Marine movies.",1391731200,2,985,4.435754189944134
4653456,3,B005CHXB4I,"I watched this film as I have been a 40k player for many years (though I play neither the Ultramarines nor Chaos of any brand). The mood of the movie was well done, the story was straight out of the fluff pages in one of the many army books (though quite predictable), and the pace and directing were properly suspenseful and explosive. My biggest complaint would be with the graphics, which weren't terrible but at some points were somewhat distracting, especially when it came to facial musculature. The biggest surprise for me was the quality of the cast, which included some premiere film and stage actors who lent a great dramatic quality to the otherwise flat characters. Overall, I enjoyed the film but I couldn't help being distracted by the shortcuts taken to save time and money. Just a few small improvements would have made mile of difference.",1390089600,,855,4.783783783783784
4653457,4,B005CHXB4I,"Knowing nothing about the Warhammer franchise, I went into this movie thinking it was live action. Nevertheless, it wasn't a disappointment to discover it was animated.  I soon found I also didn't need to know much about the background story as it seemed pretty straightforward. The Ultramarines protect everything else and the quasi-religious fervor combined with near-fanatical military zeal explains it all.  Interesting alien landscapes and the graphics are well-done though it does resemble a few of the early computer games in some aspects, especially when shown from one of the marines' POV. I had a bit of confusion when the ""enemy"" was finally met face-to-face because of the variation in uniforms and it was difficult to keep track of who was who and who'd gotten dispatched because there were so many of them.  Nevertheless, it's an entertaining movie and probably better for those in the know.  Some well-known voices are features and are easily recognizable. My only real complaint was that with their helmets removed, the soldiers all looked so old. Since most of them were supposed to be recruits on their first mission, I'd expected a little more youthful features.",1389830400,,1181,5.135416666666667

Compared to the novels it's a bit awkward, but when you're trying to put at least a solid short story that's all about character development into a movie, that's inevitable. The animation is good, and the dialogue is what you'd expect if you're a fan of the novels.

That being said...this movie was the absolute WORST thing to have the name of Warhammer tied to it.  It lacked any of the action and gritty combat that you find in anything else related to Space Marines.  They tried to make the characters have too much personality and even the Chaos marines were a joke.  I could sit here and break it down scene by scene, but my blood pressure can't take it.

I have heard a lot of negative things about this film, but it is nothing more than the typical whining of spoon-fed brats brought up on your typical Hollywood drivel.  This movie has less polish, more heart and soul.  That get's an  'A' in my book.  For the rest, go watch 'Transformers', parrot all the 'rad' one-liners to your bros, and pass this movie along to someone better equipped with an imagination and a brain to appreciate.

It has a bit much in the way of walking and talking, though the voice acting is spot on, and could do with more in the way of actual action I admit. But for a first big movie for the warhammer 40k universe, I am overall pleased. It follows a group of ultra marines on their first outing to find out why another unit of space marines have a distress beacon on. Great looking enemies and a solid graphics really make this movie quite enjoyable even with its few flaws.

I for one cannot wait for the next installment which ""Emperor"" willing , will be soon. Great voice acting by a all start cast. It's a story not centered around shooting them up with catch phrases so you will miss out If that is what your expecting , It's more of a movie of origins of the many forces fighting in the Warhammer universe.",1373500800,,685,4.111940298507463

It's based on the Warhammer 40k universe.
The plot is fairly decent. Typical Chaos-based storyline full of deceit, corruption, and betrayal.

Cons:
It doesn't stay true to the lore. As other reviewers have said, half of the movie is full of the Space Marine squad bickering with each other, which simply wouldn't happen. The animation is sub par, but not horrible for a small studio.

In all, it was a good first step. Hopefully there will be a better film in the near future.",1372723200,,482,4.658823529411765

The characters all look the same, the settings are practically nonexistent, the action is dull, the dialogue is terrible, and the plot is boring.  This film is like watching an extended and unfinished cut scene from an old videogame.  The visuals are so poor in comparison to similar films!  Compare 9 or Toy Story or even Spongebob Squarepants!!!  There is a lot more detail in both the foreground and background.

If you are truly interested in the Warhammer universe, buy the books.  There are short stories in the series that easily eclipse this movie.

Budget wise, I would say the animation was right around the middle. Many scenes are quite dark, and so it is hard to tell what exactly is going on in a shot. The story is somewhat predictable.

There was no real information as far as who the marines are and their backstory. I am sure Ultramarine fans will already know all that, but I was curious for more info. For the sake of the story, to many marines (characters) fight without their helmets on. Oops, that's a mistake. You will soon loose your head or a demon will take a bite out of it. It also seems weird that it's 40,000 years in the future, but the buildings and even the spaceship are constructed of stone and wood (??).

The direction seem like they were to walk around forever and don't find anything for half the movie, then, then most of them get killed. Later on, they move on and more get killed. Then, finally some live at the end and that's the whole direction of the movie.

What I found ignoring in this movie was hard to keep track of who is who. This is because many of the characters look almost alike. Many times, I found myself looking to see what kind of weapons the characters were holding to know who is who in the movie.

The story was confusing towards the middle as I was pretty board to follow the beginning and when something finally happened in the middle, I didn't know what they wanted to do or what's going on. But, then I didn't really want to care as I just wanted the movie to end. But, I did finish it. But...the ending wasn't good as I thought it would be. In fact, it was just bad!!!

You'll see people walk in alien world dust mist... looks like a poorly rendered sepia filter with an aliasing effect. I would it compare it to fart fog, but that would be downplaying the majesty of flatulence. You'll see people walk up stairs, into religiously significant halls, through spaceship hallways, through castle walls that are about to fall, and rickety wood bridges that have seen better days.

And seriously... If this is representative of Ultramarine 40k battle doctrine... eff them. They all deserve to die. There is more douchemanbro oozing from the morons that planned this squad-based invasion, than there is on the Jersey Shore.

I recommend the drinking rule be every time somebody says ""emperor protects""... but don't include ""every time the movie feels slow"" or you will die from alcohol poisoning.

However, if the purpose of this film was to bring to life a pretty decent short story that involves the Ultramarines, then it was successful.  I actually enjoyed the movie.  I think it conveyed the spirit of the sci-fi meets magic world of 40K well, even for those that aren't familiar with Warhammer.  However, if you are familiar with the game, codicies, and the novelizations, then you can really appreciate many of the themes that are introduced.

4653510,2,B005CHXB4I,"Unless you are a 40K fan, don't bother with this video.  If you are a fan, try and find a friend's copy to watch.  You won't have any interest in seeing it again.

Let's start with the one good thing - the voice acting.  They plumped for some actual talent.  Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I could find to say.

Dan Abnett's script is weak.  The plot twists are obvious (about two minutes in you will know EXACTLY how it ends), the dialog could have been cut-and-pasted from any 40K fluff, and the pace is slower than a Terminator marching uphill in the mud.

The pace is probably more the director's fault, though, as is much of this mess.  For some reason he has chosen movies like Once Upon a Time in the West as a touchstone, which is completely inappropriate for a movie abou Space Marines.  He chooses camera shots that emphasize the vast architecture, and zooms down to the marines, making them seem tiny and insignificant.  I want a little more heroic presentation of my 8 foot tall genetically engineered superhumans, thank you.  I actually laughed when the giant Battle Barge hanger doors opened, and a tiny little Thunderhawk flew out.

The animation feels like cut-scenes from a 2003 video game.  The character designs lack any kind of distinction.  The backgrounds and scenery are huge, empty areas, completely lacking in the Baroque ornamentation we expect from 40K.  Lots and lots of smoke, fog, and fire are used in lieu of actual scenery to fill space on the screen.

In the bonus material the director tries to take credit from ""not screwing up 40K"".  Sorry, but I think you did.  There is so much material to work with, so many existing stories and characters, so much concept art, that there really is just no excuse for producing a video this disappointing.",1364601600,,1789,4.65814696485623
4653511,4,B005CHXB4I,"I enjoyed the movie.  I think people who know a little about Warhammer 40k will be able to more understand what is going on than someone who doesn't.  I can see people watching it and going ""Wth did I just watch?"".  It doesn't give enough background and story to fill in a newbie.  But it can be enjoyable if maybe not a bit slow with some of the conversations that take place that some may not have a clue about.

I can agree with the world and environment not being gritty or gothic like some people feel it should, but you know you can't walked outside and automatically the world be gothic.  Some worlds are moreso than others and this one wasn't.

SOME of the characters were flat, why because there were around 14 space marine (the Ultramarines plus the Iron Fists) so not all of them needed to be developed.  Did some die and you not even know who they were?  Yes, but I didn't know most of the guys that died in Braveheart, Hero, etc..

The Black Legion were indeed more like khorne berserkers.  In fact I mistook them for khorne berserkers before I remembered them being identified earlier.  But ehhh, apples and oranges.

The visuals were great but maybe a bit too sharp and clean to fully give one the true mood and setting of Warhammer 40k.  The sounds were good but the voices could have been modulated a bit deeper and such when they wore their helmets, like in the games.  The story , development , and such could have been better, but for a 72 minutes movie with a limited budget, it was fine.

A good pilot/trial, maybe this can be the stepping stone for bigger and better to come.  Lets hope Games Workshop gets more involved next time.",1364342400,2,1654,4.3881578947368425
4653512,4,B005CHXB4I,"And I'm not even a Warhammer fan.

I expected a low budget production, with poor values.  I was (pleasantly) surprised.  I liked the animation technique.  The movements and texture of the movie worked for me.  The visual style was distinctive, and as a later found out, consistent with the Warhammer 40K body of work.

The story was a fairly straight forward sci-fi staple; rescue mission to an isolated outpost.  While a stock story, the characters were passably well developed (for an animated flick from a game), there were a few cliff-hangers, and one good twist.  The main characters are Ultramarines.  Genetically enhanced, power-armored super soldiers of the Empire of Man.  Their nemesis is Chaos and its minions.  Chaos, in this instance is somewhere between a dimension and a divine sort of thing, but is the opponent and threat to mankind.

A neat aspect of the collector's edition: the movies are voiced in several different languages.  It's interesting to compare a single scene in several different languages.  You don't have to understand the languages for the scenes to acquire a different character.  Try the German version...

Bring popcorn, you'll have fun.

4653520,4,B005CHXB4I,"Ultramarines deals with - yes - a squad of Ultramarines who are sent to investigate a distress beacon on the planet of Mithron, home to an important imperial shrine.  Without giving too much away, this hardy bunch of the Emperor's finest soon discover that the sinister forces of Chaos are at work.  From there, the movie proceeds according to standard Space Marine codex operating procedures, i.e., burn the heretic!  Ha!  This straightforward plot is largely executed by the numbers, something that, unfortunately, leaves little room for surprises or plot twists.  As a result, the plot is ultimately little more than a pretext for the Space Marines to do their stuff.

However, having said that, Ultramarines deserves high praise for faithfully - an important term when it comes to 40K - delivering a movie that truly does capture the essence of 40K.  This is no small feat seeing how so many other studios could have - nay, would have - over-simplified and butchered the complex lore of this setting (and believe me, 40K, being a 20+ year old franchise, has lore deeper and more complex than Tolkien's Middle Earth!).  It is all in here: the Cult of the Emperor, the daemonic forces of Chaos, bolters, chainswords, seals of purity...all that good stuff that makes 40K...well, 40K.

The CGI is quite impressive at times and is loaded with all sorts of wonderful detail, even down to the texture of the Space Marine armor.  In addition to the often lavish detail, the art direction of the CGI, one that combines a detailed realism with a bit of a graphic novel shaded cell technique, gave this movie a very distinctive look, one that is well suited to the nature of 40K's oft epic artwork.  Even the combat scenes were deftly handled, and not without a bit of gore (parents might want to keep this in mind).  Not everything is perfect, though, as I found the facial animations to be emotionally flat and devoid of life, with the Space Marines having a walking/gliding gait that seems thoroughly rigid and unrealistic at times.

The voice acting was quite good, too.  I guess this is no surprise considering the talented cast of voice actors, including Terence Stamp, John Hurt, and Sean Pertwee.  Likewise, the music was first rate and filled with medieval sounding chants that are so suited to the warrior monks who are Space Marines.

All things considered, I consider Ultramarines to be a success.  Sure, 40K purists might find a few things to grumble about (such as the chapter strike cruiser being seemingly staffed by about a crew of twelve - in the novels, these things have thousands of souls upon them), but despite a handful of flaws, the movie delivers the goods and is most definitely a 40K film that remains faithful to the setting we all love.

I think the best thing about this movie, though, is how it serves as an excellent warp gate...er, entry point to introduce new people to this franchise.  Ultramarines seems to me to have been primarily conceived as a first big toe into a larger audience.  While there is a lot of 40K lore in this film, it also strikes me as being carefully tailored so as to not overwhelm those who might be unfamiliar with this European import franchise.  Again, in this way it is a success.  I hope to see Ultramarines being gifted to kids who have been lulled to sleep by years of Jim Kirk and Anakin Skywalker (40K parents: get your kids to watch this NOW!!!!), as well as it making an appearance on Adult Swim for adult fans of anime (time to take a break from the equally tired influx of Asian ""samurais in space""  anime).  This idea is further reinforced by some of the excellent bonus content on this DVD, including an animated graphic novel that serves as a prequel to the events in this movie (quite good - tyrannids! - and explains why only a squad of Space Marines were sent to investigate the beacon), and a short featurette detailing the backstory for Space Marines in general.  I found both to provide a good foundation for those new to this setting.

In short: if you are a fan of Warhammer 40K, do yourself a favor and rent/buy this movie.  It is not perfect, but it is a good first step. And remember: ""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.""",1362873600,17,4207,4.65

In my opinion, regardless of faction, good or evil, a viewer should take some interest in at least one character, but this movie didn't do so well in that arena. On top of that, they have an abundant amount of source material from all the WH40k books, and yet these Space Marines just did not feel like they are the fearsome Adaptus Astartes we read about.

Why did they have to change ..."" Even though the movie has new characters, the subject matter experts have strong opinions about how those characters should truly be.

I wish they would have gone more into roles of the Imperial heirarchy withing the Space Marines.

I also would have liked to see the corruption of the Black Legion and Imperial Fists taking place - like exactly how a Space Marine can be corrupted and by which avenue.

4653529,2,B005CHXB4I,"There is no excuse for how bad this movie is. The CGI is equivalent to a low budget film or a really bad video game, the story is extremely simple and reflects nothing of the 40k universe, and the hype that was created around this had severely overblown the value of this product. Even the comic that is included in this set does not represent 40k or the Ultramarines. The DVD features? Even worse. Production value is low quality and this DVD will NOT play in all DVD players.

Game Workshop has been notoriously weak on the handling of Warhammer 40k outside of the minis, novels, and rulebooks for close to 20 years now. They have shown time and time again that they simply do not know how to raise this fantastic brand into something more than a tabletop game. So much potential but very poor execution. This movie (and collector's edition box) are a great example of their incompetence.
Remember the video demo of the anime styled UltraMarines story versus Chaos demons back in 98 or so? GW cancelled it because they did not want to pay half of what they paid for this CGI movie and it was a shame too because it was actually very good.

 This space marine story is not an Ultramarines story pure and simple. It could be a generic space marine story but it is not for the most recognized Chapter in this sci-fi universe. I find it incredibly hard to believe that Mr Abnett, one of the best writers for Warhammer 40k, was at all involved with this product. It is unlike any of his previous or current work. Unfortunately it looks as if Games Workshop just grabbed the best name they could to attach to a product that was having repeated production problems all the way to the end.

Two nice things from this movie is the music, which I found to be a decent match for the 40k universe, and the voice acting (which should be expected considering the talent they hired).

This is definitely a rental movie for .99. It is not worth owning. Until Games Workshop can prove they can handle managing their own property in another medium I would be wary on anything similar to this that comes out from them in the future.

One thing I can recommend to any 40k fan is the fan made film called Inquisition that was done back around 1997. It is dated and a mixture of stories from CGI to live action and a little cheesy in parts but it is made by fans and faithful to 40k. It is hard to find but worth a watch.",1361404800,,2401,4.360178970917226
4653530,3,B005CHXB4I,"FIrst off, I absolutely love the 40K setting this movie is set in.  The Emperor, the space marines, the chaos forces, the orks, the eldar, the Inquisition.  Just adore it.  One of, if not the, best sci-fi/space opera settings out there.

That being said, I can't recommend this movie as much as I might want to.  As KJ Kendall's review said, the story is good.  Dan Abnett is one of the best writers working in the 40K universe (especially his Gaunt's Ghosts series of books).  That being said, the story in the movie is hardly Abnett's best work.  It's okay, but I get the feeling he was forced to make certain edits or rewrites for movie production purposes.  It's not bad, just not nearly Abnett's best writing.

Also, I agree with KJ Kendall that the voice acting was well done.  Terrance Stamp and the rest of the cast did a fine job.  I don't have any complaints there.

So, those two things being said, the animation was horrible.  Absolutely terrible.  I've certainly seen worse, but not in a good while.  It reminded me of cut scenes from video games from a PS2 or original XBOX.  You ever play any of the Mass Effect games?  The cut scenes in those blow the animation in this movie away (in my opinion).

Now, the weird thing is, the animation starts off pretty decent actually, but seems to get worse and even more choppy as the movie goes on.  It was almost like they started off with a bang, but then maybe started running low on money and had to cut corners in places.  As the movie progresses, there were way too many scenes of the space marines just standing stationary and firing off into the distance and too many sort of robotic, unnatural movements (yes, even granted that they were bulky guys in combat armor).  So I won't just blatantly slam the animators themselves, as maybe they did the best with the budget they had, but it was not a particularly good end result.

If this movie wasn't set in the 40K universe I'd easily have given it only 1 or 2 stars.

Also, please note that I'm a big enough 40K fanboy that I bought the movie direct when they first offered it.  The ""first edition"" as it were.  This was not a blu-ray version.  So, it's entirely possible the animation was smoothed out and cleaned up for the blu-ray version.  Just be aware you may not be getting the level of animation you might be expecting.",1361059200,2,2340,4.442352941176471
4653531,3,B005CHXB4I,"The story by Dan Abnett is classic Space Marines. The voice talent is top notch (Nobody can shout ""Die Heretic!"" as convincingly as John Hurt) The one problem with this movie is the animation is about as the same quality you see in cut-scenes from PC games and pretty disappointing.

For the Space Marine fan ,this is an awesome purchase, but if you are unfamiliar with the WH40K universe this may be somewhat boring.",1360713600,4,417,4.635135135135135

The soundtrack is what I really like. lots of instrumental work and some gregorian chant style selections. It really captures the feel of the Warhammer 40,0000 universe.
In order to fully appreciate the thematic elements, the viewer should be familiar with Games Workshops tabletop miniatures game, or have read some of the novels from the black library. The casual viewer would understand the storyline, but would get more out of it by having a game geek explain some scenes and dialogue. : )
Enjoy!",1359504000,,700,4.841666666666667
4653534,3,B005CHXB4I,"I was really excited for this movie to come out. I preordered it and watched it immediately after receiving it.

THE PRESENTATION: The packaging for the film is really well done. The cover art and box are good quality and look sharp. The included graphic novel is pretty neat, and a nice touch. The only complaint about it is that the attitudes of the marines in the novel really don't come out in the film. There really isn't much continuity and you don't really get much out of it.

THE FEATURE ITSELF:

THINGS I LIKED: The movie does a good job capturing the feel of the 40K universe. The architecture of the strike cruiser and the fortress fits well with the dark gothic style I imagine. The universe seems old, dirty, and filled with shadow and cold. That's pretty good, I think. The space marine weapons and armor and well done and detailed. The voice acting is, for the most part, excellent. They got some really good names involved (e.g. John Hurt) and these voice actors did a great job. The demon itself was dark and fit well with my idea of what they should look/sound like from the books. It was really need to see a film addition to this franchise and I hope they do more.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: While in general I enjoyed the visual presentation of the film, it had some serious shortcomings. The armor looked great, but faces were poorly animated. The ship and fortress looked great, but the landscape in general was bleak and featureless (unless you count dust). The dialogue was decent, but not amazing. The space marines really didn't strike me as acting very authentic. They bickered constantly. They also seemed really unsure of themselves and of what to do next. Even if we accept that these were recently elevated novices, they should still be battle hardened beyond any mortal guardsman, but I found myself wishing for a seasoned Cadian colonel to pistol whip someone and tell the space marine to get it together. (Ok, I'm done making nerdy references.) But really, it wasn't very believable to me. The plot was also kind of bland. I liked the overall premise and I liked the twist at the end. The problem is that the twist at the end is really the only significant plot development in the entire story. The rest of the film features a very straightforward trek toward a singular objective and a lot of bickering dialogue and space marines acting insecure and easily duped.

OVERALL: I would recommend it to fans of 40K because it's an interesting experience. As someone that likes the franchise immensely, I enjoy even bad 40K because it comes with insight and discussion points. This is the only (official) 40K movie, after all. Also, the movie isn't ""horrible,"" it just has some qualities that needed improving. I would recommend it for 40K fans, not so much for someone looking for a good animated sci fi flick.",1358899200,,2838,4.656686626746507
4653535,1,B005CHXB4I,"As a huge 40K fan (I commit 2 hours (in average) daily to the IP in different ways), I was ecstatic when this got announced. After watching the movie with a friend I was horrified. Did Dan Abnett write this script or did they buy the right to use his name? I don't know...Crazy mindless Black Legion Berserkers? Ultramarine Scout squad in full power armor? A Fist Chaplain with some kind of unnamed repulsion-field technology. An empty Astartes vessel? Horrible story, infinitely boring dialogues. The characters? Flat and boring.

The overall quality of the animation screams low-budget though that's not a real problem in my opinion, still it it really really bad, also the faces are horribly done, utterly super-bad! Wow!

I don't want to offend anyone but it sickens me that some have given this movie positive reviews. Stand against this blasphemy of the Warhammer 40K Lore, don't buy it. We deserve far better than this.",1358899200,8,926,4.89171974522293

4653537,2,B005CHXB4I,"Having a degree in 3D Animation, I understand why the movie looked as it did. From the idea that Dan wrote it ( or supposely ) I am confused. Even if it was only meant to be a 10min short, there's no way the script could have been that bad. I think the best course of action should have been to save up, and let a company like Blur ( the ones who did the Dawn Of War CGI ) compose, and do everything, seeing as how they're work is nothing less than GREAT. Aside from that....Employees of Blur Studio ARE ACTUALLY WARHAMMER FANS!!!!! Honestly they missed something in the process of this project. If your a Fan you may want it, just to ....enjoy some warhammer universe without having to read, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend this product.",1357689600,2,741,4.338129496402877
4653538,5,B005CHXB4I,"First off, let me say that this review is a review of the product not just a review of the movie. For a more detailed review of the movie, I've posted one up on IMDB.com. To the review.

The collector's edition of Ultramarine comes with 3 things; the movie, the special features, and a graphic novel. The movie and Special features are in a metal case and the graphic novel is a hard-back book, both of which are major pluses. The movie is CGI and has a very nice run time. Not too short and not too long. I've read some of the other reviews on both here and IMDB about this movie. This was a big move for Games Workshop to make this movie and for it being the first movie is a feat of its own. Not everything is in the movie that is in the 40k universe, but if they did that there would be nothing to make more movies from. That being said, not everything in the movie is going to be perfectly clear. The movie was made with the expectation of the viewers to have some knowledge of the 40k universe. Not knowing this, does not mean it makes the movie bad. There are just some scenes that might make the viewer a bit lost. All in all, I'd say the movie is great. Defiantly worth watching multiple times or watch it with a group of friends.

The Special features are fantastic. Interviews with cast and crew. Documentation of Characters, weapons, and crafts. There is even an explanation of how they animated the movie. *** Spoiler Alert *** Yes, the animation for this movie is not up to par with the animation of other CGI movies. But, for this movie, a different animation technique was used. The technique used required the actors to act out the movie in front of a camera so their facial expressions could be recorded. These facial expressions where then over laid onto the character's face. This is why the characters in the movie that do not wear helmets, look similar to the actors playing the voices. Games-Workshop, also, made sure that the staff and crew working on this film had access to any and all information they need to make this movie.

The Graphic novel is, also a good read and even plays into the movie. You do not have to read the book before you watch the movie. It's just a interesting extra piece that comes with this edition of Ultramarines. As stated before, the book is a hard-back book, full color, and nice paper stock with gloss finish was used to produce the book.

All-in-all, I gave this product a 5 out 5. Very nice packaging. Good movie. Good book. Yes, the movie is does not have the best quality of picture, but for a first large scale attempt to make a movie about Warhammer 40k, it is a success.

4653539,4,B005CHXB4I,"As stated, I enjoyed ""Ultramarines"" from start to finish. I first blundered into the Warhammer world when ""Space Hulk""
hit the market, if I recall, on 3.5 inch floppy discs. I found it to be addicting and literally burned out two mice' left ""Fire"" buttons playing it on my Packard Bell 486 SX25, sporting a 100 MB hard drive...

That said, once it could only be played using a ""DOS' emulator on later OS', I stopped playing it. I didn't give the Warhammer world much thought until I recently stumbled upon the latest PC version of ""Space Marine"" and have reveled in it since.

I purchased the ""Ultramarines"" film more out of curiosity than anything else and I DID enjoy it.

For you die-hard followers of the Warhammer world, you can probably tell I am not deeply immersed into that world, and therefore cannot speak from a position of inaccuracies to the histories or story line of the Space Marines. I am a veritable novice in that world. Therefore, I am speaking as an objective critic, who enjoyed two of the games from the Warhammer world, and am not given to watching animated films to a great degree.

My critique is based solely upon the entertainment value of a movie, animated or otherwise, and if it was successful in ""entertaining"" me. In that context, it was successful, as I found it enjoyable. With the knowledge that it is based upon a fictional world of board and video games, no one can go into it with the expectation of it being ""Oscar"" material, but then again, the majority of films any of us enjoy are not Oscar winners either.

I liked the atmosphere, the live action, the conveyance of duty & honor amongst brothers of war, extended even to those of other ""lesser"" chapters, as it were.

I would buy a sequel ;-)

4653546,3,B005CHXB4I,"Ah yes, the joys of the Ultramarines.  We run into various problems with using Space Marines and the Ultramarines in particular because of the vast history of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.  The bonus material disc includes interviews with the Codex Pictures people, the voice actors and of course long standing GW legends like John Blanche and Dan Abnett.  It is made quite clear that when tackling this project the overwhelming goal is to stay true to the Warhammer 40,000 Universe and not do anything cheesey and to that end they played it safe.  Me, being an old fart and a student of all things GW for about twenty years now, playing it safe is a good choice because folks like me are going to pick apart any flaws in the characters, story, depiction of the ""spirit"" of the game and so on.  This is recognized by the film's creators.  As a whole, it is a strong piece of work and yet somehow I find myself thinking that it falls short.  At 76 minutes, Ultramarines is a short film, which is only proper because the story (even if one includes the comic from the collector's edition) is a short story.  Dan Abnett is among the most accomplished authors ever to contribute to Games Workshop and was responsible for both the screenplay and the comic.  The movie just seems so terribly predictable in its progression, but indecisive when attempting to determine if the Ultramarines are the epitome of bad-assery incarnate or just some guys who die when they get shot.  The Black Legion, for their part, appear frail by comparison which simply does not fit.  They too are Space Marines, albeit corrupted.  Their bodies though, their stature, endurance and armour are no less than the Ultramarines.  I suppose my overall complaint is the failure of the antagonists to be up to par, which is shameful since the Black Legion are (in my mind) the opposing side of the coin upon which the Ultramarines are stamped.  The animation was tremendous and the voice cast is nothing short of amazing.  Many of the voice actors are much older gentlemen with rough voices, as one would hope for when casting warriors who have lived and fought for many lifetimes of men.  On a ten-point scale though, I fear that the best I can give Ultramarines is maybe a seven.  It reaches the basic introductory level of the Warhammer 40,000 universe but as a film clearly intended for GW fans I just don't think it holds up.

4653549,1,B005CHXB4I,"First and foremost I have to say that I am a fan of warhammer 40k. There has been fantastic work done creating a rich fictional universe and the countless beings in it.

This movie shares the name of that rich universe but that is where any similarities end. This movie seems to have been made by people that have no idea of the warhammer 40k universe. In fact if you changed the armor and a few names it would have been completely generic.

If you play 40k or read the novels, you know what the games workshop business model has become over recent years. The game and fluff has always been obscenely overpriced but lately they have been milking the brand. The books are dragging on pointlessly and this movie shows how little they care about the brand anymore.

This is a movie with sub par cgi, sad plot, pathetic script, but decent voice acting. It has nothing to do with warhammer 40k and the realm that you as a fan want to see more of.

Come on gw, if you want to make people spend thousands of dollars to play a tabletop war game at least pretend that you care about your product. We spend $35.00 on a DVD the least you could do is make it something worth watching.",1345248000,8,1172,4.289592760180995
4653550,4,B005CHXB4I,"To be fair, I saw the film after reading the reviews.

It was panned by the Black Library (BL) faithful.  So, I ordered the special package with some reservations.

My review of the movie differs from many of the others, and that might be, because I had a different idea of the film before going into it.

Truth in lending ... I gave it four stars, not five ... yes, it is entirely done as a CGI movie.  Yes, it would have been great if they had done a live action version ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  I was not that upset by the CGI, because I knew it was a CGI movie going into it.

Yes, the plot was relatively linear, and if you are a hard core BL fan then you could predict what was going to happen from the opening scenes.  That said, the plot made sense.  It did not violate any Warhammer canon.

Yes, it would have been cooler if there had been some new piece of BL lore revealed, and, with Dan Abnett in the writer's chair, you might have expected something impressive like that.  No, per my earlier comment, the plot was relatively predictable and no new lore was revealed, but it was a fun plot.

Onto the positives, the voice acting was really good.  No, it was really good.

As a guy who has led men into ticklish situations, the combat chatter was reasonable.  (Often in movies, the chatter in war films is abhor-ably bad.)

The integration of little details about the WH 40K universe into the film was really brilliantly done.  Just a few examples ... the Mechanicum servitor is chanting as he rubs the ""sacred"" oils onto the equipment and praying for the peace of the spirits within.  The squad kneels before the sacred power hammer before heading out.  Yes, that was a smoking gun, but, when it appears again in a critical role at the end of the film, you appreciate that Dan Abnett followed reasonable conventions in telling the story.

Also, as a composer, I especially appreciated the score.  It absolutely fit the scenes and greatly enhanced the film (more on this in the plot description below).

Before getting to a plot description and spoilers, just a few words about the DVD special edition extras.

The interviews with the voice actors, the background information, etc. is well done and interesting.  One thing that came across is that the actors took some time to really understand their characters and revealed details in the interviews that were not obvious from the film.

My one, albeit minor, complaint is the use of Easter Eggs.  I don't want to wait for five minutes for a feature to flash across the screen to see a tidbit, but that might just be me.

Onto the plot, be warned here be spoilers.

A squad of the Ultramarines is dispatched to relieve a beleaguered force of Fists on a shrine world.  Supposedly a relic was given to the Fists by the Emperor himself. As one of the Ultramarines points out, they are twelve, and the shrine was protected by one hundred Fists.

That was the first thing that I liked about the film.  While many of the books talk about humanity being on the edge of extinction, this film made that visceral.  The Ultramarine squad was the only force within weeks of that outpost.  You realized just how grim things were.

The squad lands and takes reasonable precautions, and it does tactically sound things.

As the squad prepares for combat and enters into the atmosphere, we are treated to major chords and swelling chants in the sound track.  As the Ultramarines see the unnatural storm surrounding the shrine, the score shifts into a subtle minor key and creates a sense of foreboding.

Soon enough the squad is attacked, and we find out that there are ... Chaos Marines involved.

Eventually the group makes its way to the shrine and finds out that a daemon is involved too!  In fact, the daemon makes off with the Ultramarine Captain who accompanied the squad.

The squad continues and finds two Fists left, still guarding the relic.  You know that something is wrong with this picture.  The first clue is that the relic looks like a bed time chapter book for little Cthulhu.  The second is that the music becomes even darker.  One of the Fists is a bit addled in the head and trigger happy.  The other is a chaplain.

The squad and its two new wards makes its way back to the pick-up point and is attacked by the Chaos Marines enmasse. They are about to be wiped out ... when ... wots this?!?! ... the Captain storms in with some major wounds, but enough life in him to start clearing a path to the transport.

Up into the atmosphere and to outer space they head.  With five minutes to spare before engaging the Geller fields and traversing the Warp,  we find that the Captain is not the Captain at all.  He is the daemon!  (Who woulda' thunk it?!?!?  OK, everyone, but it is a cool idea.)

A battle ensues, and the least likely hero grabs the sacred hammer from the shrine and destroys the daemon ... roll the credits ... well, almost roll the credits ... there is a scene at the end where a new group of Ultramarine recruits is pledging before the restored shrine and sacred hammer.

The rest of the plot is that the daemon was taking the relic (actually a Warp gate) back to the home of the Ultramarines to open a portal and let the streaming Chaos horde loose on the home world to begin a conquest of a ""million worlds.""

It was fun, and I am happy that I bought it.  I am getting ready to start a Dark Heresy campaign, and this will serve nobly as an introduction to topic for the non-BL members of the party.

4653553,1,B005CHXB4I,"I never heard anything about Warhammer 40.000, before I stumbled upon this movie. And after seeing this movie, I do not wanna hear anything about it again. I understand, that this movie does not represent the whole franchise, and that the franchise might be much better than this. But frankly, if this is really the truth, the makers of this movie should show enough character and withdraw it with an apoligy, in order not to damage the franchise anymore.

All I can say about this movie is: Tripe, utter and complete tripe. I cannot remember having experienced such a sustained headshake thoughout a movie as I had here. You know... in the intro, these Ultramarines a praised as the elite of the elite, the most powerful, fearless fighing unit in the empire. Wow, one might think, let's look forward to some nice battles with the elites of the elites. But what do we get served for this? A bunch of zombies. Really, they look like zombies, talk like zombies, walk like zombies, act like zombies. And that's what we get. A squad of elite fighters walk into battle in perfect parade formation, and got shot down like clay pidgeons one after the other. So if this is the elite... oh boy, I hope they have infinite supply of grunts then, for they can only be used for suicide human wave attacks.

The best laugh to my eyes are - besides their moronic battle behaviour - their REALLY impressive looking armors. They must love them, you can see them staggering around in their armors whatever will be. I bet the do not even take it off when taking a shower, a nap or a leak. But then... the protection value of these stupid things is virtually zero. They do not even withstand a thrown axe. Hello, what is this? These guys look like walking bunkers and fall at the slightest breeze? Same goes for their offensive power. All the impressive gunnery and chainsaw-sword-thingus is not able to stop ONE (!) of their well-known enemies. How pathethic is this? This is even more confusing, for the answer would have been so easy. Just take that stupid hammer of theirs, and whack-whack-whack... the demon is gone.

To summarize the Ultramarines battle tactics: Walk in like clay pidgeons, with thick but useless armors and big but impotent weaponry, got shot down one after the other, and when all seems lost, the last man standing (more or less) takes the ultimate weapon and strucks down the up-to-this-point invincible enemy. And this is about it, that is the movie.

Again, I understand that the franchise might give much more quality than this, and maybe somebody familiar with the backgrounds would better understand the movie. But as billboard for the Warhammer franchise, this movie is just repelling.",1336780800,5,2697,4.731914893617021

And even though some of the later cutscenes are extremely short and don't have much lipsyncing they are still better than this movie.

4653557,5,B005CHXB4I,"I am a little surprised at the negative reviews because from them you get the impression that Ultramarines is a real stinker, it is not a stinker.  From the beginning I felt that 40K would be suited to an animated production but my main concern was how it would look and if they could just duplicate the graphics from the opening cut scene from the first Dawn Of War video game that it would look great and on this count Ultramarines succeeds, graphically it is everything I hoped for.  They did a great job of conveying the dark 40K setting.

Where the movie falls is the writing and the sound.  The story itself is pretty decent but writing it into a movie script left a little to be desired.  The sound is probably the worst part about the movie.  I'm surprised they did not try to fix it a little.

My real hope is that this is the first of many 40K animated features.  With the rich 40K setting there are limitless stories so I am not concerned about a lack of material.  The sound production is something that can be easily fixed.

Recommended for 40K fans but not for others, previous 40K knowledge is a big plus.  I want more!!!",1332979200,2,1136,4.3364928909952605
4653558,4,B005CHXB4I,"I have to preface my review with this: I'm not a long-time Warhammer 40k fan, and have in-fact only played the Dawn of War series of PC games (all very good) which got me interested in 40k in general.  I don't play the table top games and haven't yet read the books.  I have, however, become interested in the storyline and ideas of the 40k universe over the last few years, and was very pleasantly surprised by the Ultramarines movie.

The dialogue is great and seems very natural coming out of Spacemarines, the graphics and animation are much better than I expected, the atmosphere has that dark and gritty feel I've come to expect over the last few years (based-off my impressions from Dawn of War), and I can't say I was disappointed at all in this movie.  Again, this is coming from a fairly recent discoverer of 40k, so I obviously don't have 20+ years of expectations this movie needed to live up to.  If 40k fans thought this was going to be the all-encompassing movie that represented the whole 40k universe, then not only were they destined to be disappointed, they were also incredibly foolish.  This is essentially an indie production, albeit a very good one in my opinion, and of course doesn't come with a $100 million budget.  It is, however, probably one of the best straight-to-video movies I've seen in the last decade and the production value is surprisingly high for a small studio.

I enjoyed the story as it followed 12 Spacemarines on a single mission to a planet where they were receiving a distress call.  The story builds very well, and is coupled with that badass, tough-guy dialogue I've come to expect, while still maintaining believability and avoiding all-out cheese.  The action scenes are well done, and cinematography was well thought-out.  The only issues I'd say I have with the movie are that I wish it was just a little longer (doesn't really feel short, but 1 more action scene in there couldn't have hurt), and also that the lighting feels a little strange at times -- not bad, but just sort of weird (they are on an alien planet, however, so I suppose it can be attributed to that).

Anyways, I would strongly recommend anyone interested in watching this just to skip over the 1 and 2 star reviews, because the movie clearly deserves a better rating than that.  Not only that, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you're on the fence about watching it.  Is it worth $20 on blu-ray?  That's up to you -- I typically refuse to buy blu-rays higher than about $15, save for very rare situations.  I will say that (unfortunately) I've spent far more on much crappier movies and this certainly deserves it more than most of those.  The movie could use a drop in price to stir up more sales and I'll probably purchase it on blu-ray eventually anyways.  I really would like to see more 40k videos in the works, be it sequels or just different stories in the 40k universe, because the producers have proven they can make a good flick with a short budget.",1332892800,2,2994,4.585365853658536

4653568,3,B005CHXB4I,"Let me start out by saying that much of the criticism levied by the one and two star reviewers is valid. I too, was a little disappointed by the characters unwillingness to learn, as well as the forced dialogue.  My problems stem not from the animation, which I thought was cool (loved the comic book type appearance of it, but that's just me...) but from the inconsistencies with cannon.  It's like the developers of this did absolutely NO research on Space Marines.

Here's some examples of what I mean. First, when the squad arrives on planet, Captain Severus tells the pilot, ""extraction here in two hours."" I'm sorry but, there is absolutely NO WAY WHATEVER that even a Space Marine could cover that distance to the monastery, fight their way to and from the objective, and return to the drop zone in two hours. Even at a dead run and with no enemy contact, it wouldn't work. Had they said, ""pilot, extraction here in two days,"" that would have been better. (one day to get to the objective, the second to fight your way back)

Second, when the squad is operating in low-light conditions, like in the canyon or tallest levels of the monastery, Juno, the flame thrower operator, keeps releasing controlled bursts of flame to ""help light the way"" I guess. Here is why I say the producer/director failed to do any research. Space Marines can see clearly in next to no light conditions, including heavy fog. If nothing else, their helmets include NVG and IR packages. But let's assume they can't, the ""fireball torch"" was still stupid because what soldier will trigger a weapon like that to help guide ANYONE!?! I know, I know, it's a movie, but honestly, the possibility of 1. giving your position away to the enemy, and 2, accidentally hitting one of your own men would warrant a sever penalty from your commander.  My only other guess as to why they included it is so that they could show off their CGI effects of fire/fire weapons, but there's plenty of fighting in this movie, so they needn't have bothered.

Third, the quick clips in the film that are supposed to be first person view are ugly and stupid. Honestly, no Space Marine would have ""Courage and Honor"" taking up space on his heads up display. He's a Space Marine, he has been brought up with these concepts and had them instilled in him since his teenage years. All those words do is waste space on his view display. That would be like a U.S. Marine writing ""Semper Fidelis"" on the inside of his combat goggles so he can see them when he looks out.

Okay, now that I've listed what I don't like, let me talk about what I do:

Epic scenery: the aftermath of the battles, the ruined monastery, the interior of the star-ship, all ROCKED!

Epic fighting: I like the suspense and action parts, very dramatic.

epic plot twist: I didn't see it coming, although I just sort of zoned out and watched it on autopilot since I was so tired. I don't think a 40K fan who had read more fiction would have been surprised though, judging by some of the other reviews.

Pleasant movie: all things considered, I enjoy this movie. It's a fun way to just kill some time watching something not very in depth. I do hope though that the next 40k movie they make, if they do make one, is done by THQ or using the same graphics generators they produce.",1327622400,2,3295,4.53030303030303
4653569,2,B005CHXB4I,"Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie is certainly a landmark in the quest to make 40k a mainstream IP.  However, it was doomed to receive an insurmountable level of expectation from a fan base of people that have had over 20 years to mentally construct their ideas of perfect 40k battle scenes that they would have in a movie.  I did not expect Ultramarines to live up to the hype; there was just no way a small studio like Codex could do it.

However, there was even less substance to the movie than I had expected.  The animation's low quality did not bother me, as Codex is certainly no Pixar.  What did bother me was the utter lack of a reason to care about what was happening.  The space marines had almost no personality or interesting traits about them - a major disappointment, when novels in the Black Library consistently generate stories about superhuman Space Marines who have very human minds, opinions and conflicts.

On the topic of the Black Library, it's no secret that Dan Abnett - author of many of the best Warhammer novels in existence - could have done so much more in creating an interesting story.  Something tells me he didn't have as much control as he wanted, and he was likely confined to elaborating on a specific, pre-determined concept in order to stay within Codex's abilities.  Then again, maybe he just had a bad writing day.  Who knows.

A reviewer has already mentioned that, while Codex declared this movie to be for the fans, it most certainly is not for the diehard ones.  Those who know 40k lore like a preacher knows the bible will find inaccuracies and nonsensical story-making decisions all over the place.  Chaos marines charge the Ultramarines as if they are mindless unarmed cultists.  Ultramarines arguably make tactically unsound choices in combat that even a guardsman would facepalm at (""We're under fire!  Jump out and crawl under the landspeeder!""; That's not very space marine-like!).  The list goes on.  I'm no lore buff, but even I was surprised by the lack of the courage and heroism that the 40k universe insists is the essence of the space marines.

There are some genuinely good aspects.  The voice acting was mostly flawless, and the cinematography was great, even if the animations weren't.  Some of the action was quite good, mostly when the marines weren't standing in one spot and spraying their bolters (which was too often).

You may find some enjoyment in Ultramarines, provided you aren't expecting anything near blockbuster entertainment.  I sincerely appreciate that Codex pictures tried to give the fans something to quench the hunger for a 40k movie, and I hold no resentment towards them.  However, it just isn't much more than a mediocre independent action flick.",1327363200,3,2739,4.855603448275862

4653572,1,B005CHXB4I,"Had made the mistake of pre-ordering the DVD Special Collector's Edition when it was first made available.  It was a painful lesson and the purpose of this review is to warn others, especially Warhammer 40K fans.  There are multiple shortfalls to this movie: poor quality animation, poorly scripted action scenes, bumbling one dimensional characters, and questionable storyline.

The first and top downfall of this movie is the poor quality animation.  If one views a clip from the movie and compares it to the late 1990's release of the video game Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels, the background set designs are of equal quality.  If one compares the movie to Relic's Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War video game opening cinematic, hands down Relic is clearly the better of the two.  If one compares the movie animation to the downloadable PS3 W40K Space Marine: Kill Team video game, again, the Relic animation and in-game graphics are better than the movie.  Relic's Space Marine video game on PS3 and X-Box 360 has better in game graphics and set designs than the movie.

To be honest, Games Workshop should have contracted with either Relic Entertainment or Blizzard for the animated movie.  It would have been of better quality and style, even if using their in-game graphics engines.  The quality of Blizzard's game cinematic videos has always been top notch and Relic a close runner up.  This leaves us wondering as to why Games Workshop failed to sign a company to produce a movie of equal animation quality to the video game company that makes their games, such as Relic Entertainment.

Next shortfall is the action scenes.  Every W40K fan of the games or science fiction novels understands that Space Marine armor is designed to withstand a few, if not multiple impacts.  Well, there are no armor saves in this movie, no rounds deflecting off the Space Marines or the Chaos Marines, just the slow-motion, John-Woo or 300 wannabe cinematic of the round hitting the target in the eye.

*** Spoiler alert ***
So when fighting a big bad Chaos daemon, does one use holy blessed weapons, psychic weapons (such as a Librarian or even a Navigator), high explosives, or use a standard bolter?  Well our ""heroes"", even though in an armory full of weapons, choose the bolter.  Seriously, no grenades, heavy flamer, or specially blessed chain sword, just a bolter?  Any video game player, science fiction reader, or miniature gamer would choose a combination, to include grabbing the Navigator to use their ""gift"", to fight a daemon.
*** End spoiler ***

The third shortfall is the one dimensional bumbling characters.  Their testosterone filled, genetically enhanced macho attitude has dulled their ability to learn and analyze.  As the lore goes on Space Marine selection, prior to the gene seed implantation, candidates must not only be tough and lucky, but have the intellect to learn and adapt to overcome the myriad of challenges.

Unfortunately for us, the Space Marines we are forced to watch are definitely noobs who seem to know that everything can be solved through the use of the bolter.  A basic military fundamental is to research, analyze, and develop a plan rather than simply jumping into the void.

If one reads Andy McNabb's true account, book titled Bravo Two Zero, of a disastrous recon mission in Iraq from 1991, one understands the real life importance of planning.  If the movie presented a pre-mission planning session, similar to the video game scenario intros in Dawn of War, Starcraft 1 and 2, Space Marine, Kill Team, Command and Conquer, etc, it would have made sense and added some interest to the characters in showing some sign of intellect.  Think about it, the movie could have displayed a galaxy screen showing how far they were, a planet screen showing the location they were responding to, and a 3-D terrain map showing where they would land and travel to the site, just like the video games do.

This leads into the final fatal flaw of the movie, the questionable storyline.  Fans of the W40K genre know that Space Marines have hundreds, if not thousands, of humans, serving on their space vessels.  Some of these humans are not normal, but have been bonded to the Holy Emperor as navigators and astropaths, all who also serve on a Space Marine vessel, the normal humans are simply serfs serving the Marine Chapter.

Chaos Marines also have cultists and slaves serving them.  When the action kicks up, it is simply Marine versus Marine or Marine versus daemon.

Thus, the poor animation fails to create the vast dimensions of humanity serving on the Space Marine vessel, at a Chapter base on a planet, or the Chaos lackeys.  The rich expanse and epic scale of the W40K universe would have been matched had the movie included serfs and lackeys fighting each other, alongside their Space and Chaos Marine superiors.  The viewer would have gained a better understanding of the power of a Space Marine in comparison to a standard human, or of a daemon, had they battled dozens of humans at the same time.  The video game Dawn of War, in game cinematic had background Imperial Guard and Cultists getting chopped up or shot to pieces, why couldn't the movie included similar?

This is why the storyline is questionable, the lack of bolter fodder in the background.  The absence of serfs and lackeys doesn't show the dramatic impact of how insignificant regular humans are to the gene seed Marines or warp spawn daemon.

*** Spoiler alert ***
What is really questionable in storyline is how the Space Marine vessel is able to so quickly return to their home planet.  If it was so close, then why didn't they send more to assist in the rescue mission?  Another questionable item is the flashback scene of the attack on the Space Marine outpost, it just shows swirling ""objects"".  Why weren't more of these objects later encountered?  Plus, the outpost has been over-run, with a mere two Marines remain alive, with no defenses protecting their sanctum.  Why would the Chaos Marines not choose to at attack the Space Marines holding out?  The script and storyline should have included at least a few failed assaults on the remaining Marines sanctum.
*** End spoiler ***

To summarize, the spoiler complaints are detractors from the movie, but the fatal flaw is the really poor animation and lack of grand cinematography one expects from the Warhammer 40K universe.  One has better animation and plot scenario script writing in the video games than in this dreadful movie.  This is why is movie barely rates 1-star and should not be purchased.  Buying a W40K video game is a better investment of time and money.",1326153600,16,6641,4.866548042704626
4653573,3,B005CHXB4I,"I think if they had used one of the companies making the cut scenes for the games it could have been much better.  The story is a little far fetched, but might have lost some translation from the script to the film. It is nowhere near as polished as the majority of the cgi movies out there. It has some cool things, but overall its fairly mediocre minus a couple fight scenes. Im glad i got this version instead of the collectors from the Games Workshop site as at this price point its not as painful to watch. I had really high hopes for it, but i give it a 5 out of 10. its not horrible, but its not that good either. Like i said if you love 40k and all the fluff you can get your hands on, you will like some of it. They had a teaser of a ultramarine terminator before this came out, sadly they are not in the movie. Its a story about one ship and one squad and a bunch of evil. Ill say no more spoilers than that.",1325289600,,918,3.935483870967742
4653574,3,B005CHXB4I,"I disagree with both the people who exult over this movie and those who hate it.  40K is an inherently bland world and space marines are the most bland of all.  90% of the marines in any squad are just unnamed cannon fodder and this movie is true to that.  Out of 14 characters you have a Named Chaplain/Librarian, Captain, Apothecary, Relic Carrier and Main Character.  5 Named Characters and 9 cannon fodder is actually pretty good for 40K.  The story shows the 40K Space Marines pretty much as the game and novels do.  If anything the Ultramarines should be even more into cliches and praises to the Emperor.  They are after all the ultimate emperor botherers of the marines.  The Black Legion act like assault squads and charge instead of shooting, but that is part of the plot line.  They are following orders to let themselves lose the battle.  The only thing I really saw wrong was the flamer.  I realize that the flamer is the squad special assault weapon default for unknown situations.  But come on, flamers are not going to hurt a marine in power armor.  And if you are constantly using one as a torch the fuel won't last very long.  The castle really should not have been in that kind of disrepair, especially the rickety wooden bridge.  The only truly bad special effect was the battle barge animation.

This was not an inspired plot, but not horrible either.  It just was what it was.  A Space Marine squad acting like a Space Marine squad.  If you want character development choose something like the Tanith or Ciaphas Cain.  Calpurnia would be an excellent choice for a movie set into the 40k world with the at least possibility of picking up some of the police procedural audience too.",1324166400,,1702,4.591362126245847

4653576,2,B005CHXB4I,"I watched the movie on Youtube.

I was elated when I heard the news about a Warhammmer 40K movie coming out... CGI too, so I had high expectations of eye-candy seen in other CGI movies.  I was happy about the movie coming out as it was a sign of the Warhammer 40K gaming universe going mainstream.  The possibility of more and better artistic content coming out in the future was becoming more likely.  Alas...

The animation was on par with the animated Starship Trooper series.  The plots in those half hour episodes were just as good as the plot in this movie, only stretched out much longer in this movie.  Yes, the movie was boring at times, as the previous reviewers have stated... ""bicker, walk, bicker, walk some more"".

I liked the voice acting, yet the differentiation on-screen between characters was slight and hard to discern who's left in the movie as it grinds on.

Maybe the next time another Warhammer movie comes out it will feature an aspect of Warhammer 40K which makes it easier to recognize the characters in the movie like the Imperial Guard or the Inquisition; although, that will drive up the production costs in animating distinct characters rather than using a cookie-cutter model for all characters in this movie.

If the challenge of finding a good plot/script for the next movie proves to be insurmountable, then I suggest turning the Daemonifuge comic series into a movie.  I expected a great step forward, instead I was disappointed to realize this movie was simply ""cashing out"" on this intellectual property.",1322179200,,1542,4.82509505703422

Anyone can be suped up on juice and be super strong but to be able to do that in power armor is just awesome.
