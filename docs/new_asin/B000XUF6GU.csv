8229746,5,B000XUF6GU,"I saw this documentary a couple of years ago on CBC television. As it aired there, it was an hour long program and was quite entertaining on its own...but here is the full program with lots more footage and comments from Randy Bachman, Burton Cummings and many others who were around at that time...you get to see bands like The Haunted in addition to the early footage of Gordon Lightfoot and so many others. The TV version was good, but if you're a fan of Canadian pop music at all, you owe it to yourself to see the full program!",1333497600,2,532,4.33
