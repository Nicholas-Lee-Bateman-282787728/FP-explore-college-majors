Now, I wish I'd have waited till you could rent it, as it's one thats not worth watching over & over again as Steel Magnolias (for example) was.

1622156,1,B00005LKIA,"Review of ""These Old Broads""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Is there anyone out there who wants to see Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor sit down, hold hands, and argue about sex and a man Taylors character stole from Reynoldss character decades ago? How about hearing Shirley MacLaine say, My inner child is having such a tantrum while wearing a turban and waving incense in front of her face?

These Old Broads was co-written and co-produced by Carrie Fisher, as yet another hate letter to her mother. Apparently, she didn't get it all out of her system in Postcards From the Edge. In this one, her mother plays one of the title characters. Fisher had problems, problems she desperately wanted the world to know about via projecting her hatred for her mother up on the big screen. Why else would she create a movie about four old hags, all playing caricatures of their real-life personas, who hate each other and quip extremely stupid one-liners about their age, appearance, and sex lives?

The only reason anyone would sit through this terrible, terrible movie would be if they were 100% on Debbie Reynoldss side during the Eddie Fisher scandal and still want revenge on Elizabeth Taylor, and if they get a thrill from making fun of older actresses. Basically, Carrie Fisher. Anyone one else will most likely, and wisely, turn it off.",1498435200,,1340,4.792207792207792

They took 4 very talented actresses and gave them a lame script; definitely not what they were capable of. I rented it mainly out of curiosity and to see Debbie and Liz play off each other, but Ms. Taylor appeared to be drunk or stoned through all of her lines and the accent they had her use was horrible.

Shirley played a character based on Debbie in the film written by Carrie Fisher, 'Post Cards From The Edge'.

Elizabeth stole Debbie's husband Eddie Fisher.

As Carrie Fisher said they are all related by scandal.

1622258,5,B00005LKIA,"To start off my review, I would like to make it known that do not own this film on DVDI recently recorded off of Get-TV. These Old Broads is a made-for-television movie from 2001, starring (in credits order) Shirley MacLaine (66), Debbie Reynolds (68), Joan Collins (67), and Elizabeth Taylor (68). This perhaps intentionally campy little movie is a whole lot fun! It's not the cream of the crop by no means, and no one in the movie attempts to make it more than it is, and that's definitely a plus. Its cast seems to almost destine this flick to either an audience filled with lovers of old Hollywood, or those looking for entertainment that is somehow simplistic, noticeably uneven, but undeniably appealing. However, a viewer will either love or hate this film.

The remainder of this review may contain some spoilers! The basic plot is rather simple: the 1960s musical-buddy feature, Boy Crazy, is re-released in the 1990s to great success, making its three female stars the center of attention all over again. They are Kate Westbourne (MacLaine), Piper Grayson (Reynolds), and Addie Holden (Collins). Kate's son, documentary filmmaker Wesley (Jonathan Silverman), is hired to reunite the three ladies in TV special by television producer Gavin (Nestor Carbonell). There's only one problem thoughthese women cannot stand each other! With the help of their agent, Beryl Mason (Taylor), Wesley manages to get all three women to do the special, although none them are particularly excited about it. Later, Addie's boyfriend, Tony (Pat Harrington, Jr.), escapes from prison and dies while Addie's hiding him, sparking a scandal and generating further interest in the special. After multiple yelling matches and much cattiness, the plug is pulled on the special. However, Wesley and Beryl manage to get it going again, and in the final scenes, it proves to be a big success.

That is basically the story of These Old Broads, very briefly and very generally. As I said above, this film is camp, and while these ladies may have been quite aware of that fact, they do not try to make their performances intentionally over-the-top or campy; they are quite simply playing what was written for them, which is basically a parody of their real-life personas. MacLaine is the most serious and actress-like of the trio; Reynolds is the cutesy and lovable one; and Collins is the publicity-hogging sex symbol. I have been a rather big fan of Joan Collins and Elizabeth Taylor for some time, and a casual fan and appreciator of Debbie Reynolds. Of the four, I am the least fond of Shirley MacLaine, although I have gradually learned to give her the respect she has earned.

I think these four ''old broads'' do justice to their parts. Although Collins' Addie is, in the movie, supposedly younger than MacLaine's Kate and Reynolds' Piper, in real-life she was a year older than MacLaine and a year younger than Reynolds. All three look great for women approaching 70, with Collins looking particularly youthful in the face (this credit, I'm sure, goes to the plastic surgeries she refuses to admit she has had), while Reynolds, too, looks quite beautifully adorable in her own right. MacLaine, the youngest of the trio, looks the oldest here; she seems a bit overweight perhaps... maybe that's it? As for Miss Taylor, who was the most-popular during their heyday, her screen time is minimal (she's on-screen roughly 10 or 12 minutes the entire movie!). Her health issues, I'm sure, reduced her ability to do as much as we would have liked her to do in this movie, but she is a welcomed and very much appreciated addition here. However, I must say she does seem somewhat miscast as a tough-talking show business agent. MacLaine, Reynolds, and Collins rehearse in very tight and very revealing costumes. Although Collins may have had the perfected face, her figure is rather flat; she has absolutely no hips or butt. Reynolds, on the other hand, feels out her tights rather nicely.  That's all I'll say about these aspects of the movie...

Now, back to the movie itself... These Old Broads does have its problems (but then, what movie doesn't?). The general idea of having three actresses that hate each others guts reuniting under somewhat forced pretenses is good, but their relationships are uneven. They are said to hate each other. However, Reynolds and MacLaine's characters seem to have some respect and kindness between them, while Collins is left out, with the others making fun of her ''phony'' English accent and multiple romances. And, when Collins wants to hide her convict boyfriend, MacLaine and Reynolds agree to help her! Would you do this for someone you do not like? I don't think so. However, I suppose I am over-analyzing a movie that clearly is not taking itself seriously. Don't expect Masterpiece Theatre from These Old Broads and you want be disappointed. I love it despite its faults! I did not fail to make me crack a smile! Recommended.",1461801600,2,4948,4.928057553956834

1622270,2,B00005LKIA,"Vulgar. Crude. Crass. Rude. Those are some adjectives that come to mind for this ""tv show"". I cannot even imagine this being on TV.

This was a stereotype of older women who were young in the 1950s. It played to the idea that women and men were just as trashy then as they are today . . . just as common . . . only they had to ""hide it"" which of course isn't true. The actresses were shown falling down like a bunch of circus clowns. Making lewd comments about men and sex. It was just disgusting. It reminds me of the ""Golden Girls"" where Hollywood tried to rebrand the elderly as sex crazed trashy people to make them ""hip"". There was absolutely no plot to this that you have no seen before. Three has beens are reunited but hate each other. Anyway what I find sad is that these are great actresses and performers. You can see that in the final song/dance routine. But up to that point you would think that they had not done anything of repute. I mean come on. Shirley Mcllaine did a show in Las Vegas for years. Why waste such talent with this garbage? Why did they do it is what I kept asking myself. I mean Debbie Reynolds is so addicted to working that she sold out for shows like ""Will and Grace"". We expect it kinda. And it goes without saying for Collins. But Elizabeth Taylor for whatever reason had a classy reputation. Why tarnish it with this? I will say for her that she did a pretty good Brooklyn/NYC Jewish accent in this film. One of the first times I have ever seen her half way act. But still . . . .

Debbie Reynold's went through a miserable time when her husband, Eddie Fisher (1955-59), fell in love with her actress friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Debbie and Eddie divorced in 1959. Debbie married Harry Karl in 1960 and then Richard Hamlett in 1984.
  For the sake of this tv-movie, These Old Broads (2001), Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor mended their ways against each other.

 None of the actresses had worked together before in a motion picture, but had appeared on certain tv specials and have been in the same room with each other during the Academy Awards.

 Debbie Reynolds and Gene Barry had worked together before in the ""Aloha Paradise"" brief tv series in 1981.

 Shirley MacLaine appeared in a tv special ""Happy Birthday Elizabeth: A celebration of Life"" in 1997.

 Johnathan Silverman and Debbie Reynolds appeared in the tv-movie, Pryor Offenses (2004).

Written by the brilliant Carrie Fisher and with acting legends Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Shirley MacLaine, and the talent of Debbie Reynolds and Joan Collins, one could expect more, but given the limitations of a network television movie, and that ""the old broads"" seem to be doing this just for fun, that is how it should be viewed. It's funny, campy, lightweight entertainment.  Some of Fisher's lines are gems, especially the exchanges between MacLaine, Collins, and Reynolds.  Dame Elizabeth's accent can be annoying, but that is what the character is supposed to be.  While not a career highlight for any of the luminaries involved, it does deserve to be seen and enjoyed as a bit of campy fun.  Dame Elizabeth's last film role.",1348704000,7,790,4.946969696969697

1622342,4,B00005LKIA,"I was really looking forward to finally seeing this movie, as it stars four of my favourite ladies from Hollywood's golden years (Joan Collins, Debbie Reynolds, Shirley MacLaine and Elizabeth Taylor) and features a script especially tailored for the gals by Carrie Fisher (""Postcards from the Edge"").  Just like that autobiographical comedy based on her relationship with mother Debbie Reynolds--ironically played by Shirley MacLaine--this story is set in the world of backstage Hollywood, and has quite a lot of bite in it's satirical view of celebrity ego.

THESE OLD BROADS is the story of three has-been actresses who are asked to reunite when their 1960's ""Where the Boys Are""-knockoff movie musical suddenly becomes popular again on the revival circuit.  TV execs approach Wesley Westbourne (Jonathan Silverman), a serious producer of documentaries, to convince his born-again, New Age mother Kate (Shirley MacLaine) to commit to the project.  He'll have an ever harder time swaying her former co-stars Piper Grayson (Debbie Reynolds), who has retired to operate a Vegas casino stocked with old movie costumes; and Addie Holden (Joan Collins), a virtual recluse still in close contact with a jailed Mobster boyfriend.

Once the ladies are set, the fun begins!  Addie's boyfriend escapes prison and suffers a fatal heart-attack in the throes of passion (an hilarious throwback to one of Ms Collins' classic ""Dynasty"" scenes); Piper's husband (Peter Graves) looks certain to be yet another notch on Addie's bed post, and Kate must reveal a bombshell concerning Wesley's true parentage...

Elizabeth Taylor has a small but fun role as the ladies' agent Beryl Mason, a tough-talking, pot-smoking harpy.  Carrie Fisher also appears in a brief cameo.  One of the best scenes sees Piper and Beryl discussing their past romance with a certain man who is none-too-subtly based on Eddie Fisher.  Taylor made headlines all over the world when Eddie Fisher left his wife, Debbie Reynolds and their children--one of course being Carrie Fisher--in order to marry Liz, still mourning the death of husband Mike Todd who was a close family friend.  Although the two buried the hatchet long ago, congrats to Fisher for bringing together momma Debbie and ""scarlet stepmother"" Liz for this lovely on-screen reconciliation.

This will be an essential purchase if you're a fan of the gals.",1265068800,5,2373,5.26525198938992

These women are  the last of a generation of real MOVIE STARS. What young actresses today could make this kind of movie and make it work.

1622355,5,B00005LKIA,"It's a flimsy story, a rather weak and shockingly uninspired Carrie Fisher screenplay. On that alone it should be dismal. But something wonderful happens as ""These Old Broads"" begins to unreel, four fabulous stars from Hollywood's silver age take the tried old script and turn it into movie magic.
  Elizabeth Taylor has the smallest role but turns in a fun and funny characterization complete with a Brooklyn accent. Then there is Joan Collins (Twentieth Century Fox's 1950's answer to MGM's Taylor) who gives us her funniest role since Alexis on ""Dynasty"" or ""Rally Round The Flag Boys"". She is over the top as only she can be and it is pure Collins comic gold.
  Shirley MacLaine nearly steals she show as a tongue in cheek version of herself. She delivers the comedy and pain required of her role with that gypsy charm and twinkle that are her trademark. But it is Debbie Reynolds who really owns this film. Playing a version of herself she shows that ""Tammy"" is still unsinkable. She just sparkles and sparks. And in the now famous scene between her and Taylor as they come to grips over ""Freddy Hunter"" (Eddie Fisher) she is a joy to watch. Touching, tender and wise. That scene is the best Carrie wrote for the film. (Perhaps a catharsis for all three women) For anyone who remembers the Taylor-Fisher-Reynolds scandal it is a treat.
  So in the end the film is a tribute to the talent of these women. Taylor is now  sadly retired but the other three are still working and showing us that these studio trained actresses are not just fine entertainers. They are still some of the brightest Stars in the Hollywood heavens.",1252972800,7,1627,4.687719298245614

To their credit, Joan Collins, Shirley MacLaine, Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor appear to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, and certainly give their all to this trifle, about three quarreling film stars reunited for a TV special when a film they made together proves an unexpected hit on its re-release. The script, co-authored by Reynolds' daughter Carrie Fisher, artfully blends fiction and fact--MacLaine's character is obsessed with New Age metaphysics, for example, and Reynolds is running, not too successfully, a Las Vegas casino. When Reynolds and Taylor, as a crochety agent, have a frank discussion about the husband the latter stole from the former, one wonders just who is talking--the characters, or the actresses themselves? Such juicy speculations keep the action bubbling past the creakier junctions of the plot, particularly the tiresome scenes with Jonathan Silverman as the beleaguered director (and MacLaine's adopted son--shades of Joan Crawford) and Nestor Carbonell as the requisite hugely egotistical producer. The shock value of hearing such frank talk about sex issuing from such classy womens' mouths wears off after a while, too.
