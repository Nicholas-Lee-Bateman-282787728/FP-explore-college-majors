8741236,5,B0182YFYAG,"Disclosure: I receive this product for the purpose of a review.

My son loves robots especially transformers, so it wasn't a surprise to me that he really enjoyed this movie. He is 9, so at first I was little worried that this may be a little ""childish"" for him, but he still enjoyed it. I personally like that it secretly taught him a lesson...work together and you can overcome certain battles! It last almost two hours, so it was perfect for keeping him entertained while I tried cleaning up the house real quick :) Yes, I think I like a mom.",1468368000,,545,4.396039603960396
