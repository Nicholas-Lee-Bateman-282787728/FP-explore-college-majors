8640106,1,B00I9H3VOS,"The cover is misleading.  The ""formula"" is never shown to work.  The description is also misleading.  I usually find some value in movies I rent.  I often see them once and then really want to see them again sometime.  The basic goal of the people in the movie was to develop a formula to make people do what they want them to.  According to the ""story:"" it seemed to work on a lot of women but not the ones that counted.  It was never plausibly explained how it worked.  I have seen movies where the plot requires something that can never happen in reality and it does in the movie and as I watch, I believe the unbelievable.  In this movie, even things that can happen for real were not believable.  The dialog was disjointed.  The plot was nebulous.  The acting was erratic.  The line delivery was OK.  No drugs or nudity.  Maybe one or two instances of mild bad language.  Only implicit sex with 40's or 50's style implications.  I really can't recommend this movie.  I see no reason to watch it again and almost didn't finish it the first time.",1431043200,,1049,4.375

8640108,2,B00I9H3VOS,"Quinn (Brandon Baker), Graham (Mike Schminke), and Lee (Tyler Thirnbeck) share an apartment and have girl issues. As engineering students, Quinn and Graham have come up with a formula to ""predict and control people's thoughts"" something us old school guys call manipulation, a word that is never used. Things go well with the formula other than the fact they can't win the girl they really want.

There are no babes in bikinis. This is not a teen sex comedy as one might expect. All the sex is behind closed doors. The worse language was using ""taco"" in a slang adult fashion.  This is a romance comedy drama without much of either. The film was rather boring, even the bloopers at the end lacked humor. Now there were a few scenes that I liked, such as Quinn bumping into TJ (Katie Goebel) at a bar. Nice little initial romance scene. Professor Millan (Reginald VelJohnson) had a few good lines, but in general the film was cliche and boring.  1 1/2 stars

Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Implied sex. Semi-adult talk.",1420243200,4,1017,4.664804469273743
8640109,4,B00I9H3VOS,Got this movie because my cousin is in it.  A good flick that is entertaining.  A coming of maturity film with the lead characters learning life lessons.,1407024000,,153,4.62962962962963
8640110,1,B00I9H3VOS,"The cover is misleading, the women in the film do not look that beautiful and there is NO nudity.",1406851200,29,97,4.157894736842105
8640111,1,B00I9H3VOS,"If you are looking for a National Lampoon style movie, this isn't it.  I know the cover is set up like theirs, but that is the only similarity.  For me, the movie feels as though it is written by a 20-something man-child who has had his heart broken once & decided to write a movie about it with his parents producing it for him.  Instead of writing something poignant, they write some drivel about being a dick to get laid.  Very sad attempt of a Rom-Com.
So 2 college boys come up with The Formula to get any girl they want.  Turns out, they also discover that they have to change everything about themselves too.
No nudity nor any of those women on the cover.",1406419200,21,662,4.264
8640112,2,B00I9H3VOS,"I give it one star for filming in Iowa City, Coralville and West Liberty. I give it another star for hiring Reginald VelJohnson (Carl Winslow) and James Morris (former Iowa football player). Other than that the best part of the movie were the bloopers during the credits.",1405900800,4,271,4.787234042553192
8640113,4,B00I9H3VOS,I thought this movie was fantastic!  Coming up with a formula to get girls.... what a concept.  Great for any college guy out there.  It's all within reach.,1399507200,2,156,4.5
8640114,4,B00I9H3VOS,#TheFormula is an enjoyable & fun romantic comedy with a few recognizable faces. (Isn't that the cop from DIE HARD?) Worth a look!,1395619200,2,130,4.695652173913044
