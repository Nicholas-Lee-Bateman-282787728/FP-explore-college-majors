8148210,5,B000IZJROC,Very interesting older style Bollywood movie with a young and very energetic SRK . It's very unsophisticated but it grows on you the second time through--SRK really delivers in the end and it's nice to see his acting ability even so early in his career.,1405555200,2,253,4.644444444444445
8148211,5,B000IZJROC,SRK an orphan who didn't find support from society and grow up in crime world and he become Don and he fall in love with girl  who try to change him to good,1402185600,,156,3.727272727272727
8148212,5,B000IZJROC,"Very touching story. Sometimes we judge people by their action without knowing what is really going on in their mind. Shahrukh bhai,
you're the very best of Bollywood! Love ya!",1389744000,,176,4.9
8148213,4,B000IZJROC,What can I say....Shahrukh Khan is in this one.  I love Shahrukh Khan in spite of the plot of the movie.  I was entertained.,1384300800,,124,4.125
8148214,1,B000IZJROC,Many parts of this film were missing/edited out and the quality of the print was not good. We were disappointed.,1359072000,2,112,4.65
8148215,3,B000IZJROC,"Although I am a huge fan of SRK movies.  And I hope to see all that he has done-this one was just o.k.-He plays a negative character and I prefer to see him in the good-guy-Hero type roles.  The quality of the movie was not very good. Showed some lines - like it came from a tape.  Glad I got to see it, but really glad I didn't purchase it. I have been buying the ones I really like.",1357776000,3,384,3.8354430379746836
8148216,5,B000IZJROC,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. He plays a negative character in this film, but makes the audience sympathetic to him. He and his childhood friend chose different ways of fighting against things that are wrong in the world. He is a hero to me in this film. I really loved this film.",1334880000,,307,4.133333333333334
