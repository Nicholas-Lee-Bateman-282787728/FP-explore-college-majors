8447652,3,B004XZ9A0E,"This collection is only for the casual fan (who probably already picked up set 1). Any hopes of getting some of the missing episodes are dashed by MPI's press release:

This 200-minute disc, aimed at the more casual and budget-conscious fans, includes this list of episodes:
""Be It Ever So Humble"",
""The Sun & Raccoon Capital"",
""Two Faces Of Ralph Kramden""
""Double Trouble"".

These stories, part of The Jackie Gleason Show (the top-rated TV series from 1966-1970), marked the first time ""The Honeymooners"" ever aired in color, and star Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden, Art Carney as Ed Norton, Sheila MacRae as Alice Kramden and Jane Kean as Trixie Norton.

And what about the 4th reunion special, where has that gone?",1306886400,,718,4.917355371900826
