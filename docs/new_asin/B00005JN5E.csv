1521249,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a fast paced action picture with enough substance to keep non-action fans interested.

Nicolas Cage is great.  He's not the worlds first choice in action heroes, but he brings intelligence to the role, which NT needs in the star.  It was great to see Sean Bean in another major role (he was great as Boromir).  He brings supreme credibility to a critical role.

No idea who the female lead is.  She was fine, save for one scene where her accent went from its normal hard-to-spot to suddenly very thick.  Still, her role was potentially unbelievable, and she was up to the task.  A lesser actress could have spoiled the film.  Join Voigt was fine, as was the rest of the cast.

NT does a fine job of making a potentially hokey plot work.  The science/history is always enough to keep our disbelief firmly suspended, but never enough to make us think we're in a lecture hall.  Finally, NT is frequently hilarious.  There are more laughs here than in many comedies released this year.

National Treasure is entertaining from beginning to end.",1100995200,,1060,4.690217391304348
1521250,3,B00005JN5E,"(3 & 1/2 stars) The audience at the showing I attended of National Treasure seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I know I did.  The movie is a fun and satisfying adventure story.  Still, it's sort of like a lesser roller coaster at an amusement park.  Where Indiana Jones is the big draw, the one that has the longest lines of people waiting for the experience, National Treasure is the slightly less exciting ride, the one with shorter lines.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the new movie was fine, it just lacked the edge-of-your-seat thrills of the best genre pix like Indy Jones.  Still, there are a lot of things to recommend about National Treasure.  The cast were all very likeable, especially Justin Bartha as Riley Poole (the comic relief).  The story has a nice tie to American colonial history, and it's kind of cool to imagine that our founding fathers might have been involved in a conspiracy to hide a huge cache of ancient treasure.  Overall, though, this film rises only to the level of ""good,"" not ""great.""",1100995200,,1020,4.653631284916201
1521251,5,B00005JN5E,National Treasure was one of the best movies I've seen.  Keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the entire flick.  Very well done. Great suspense.  As soon as it comes out on DVD it's mine. Makes you want to take US History again.  Great movie!,1100995200,,248,4.568181818181818
1521252,5,B00005JN5E,"I'm surprised that this movie has attracted so much scorn. Is it silly and far-fetched? Well, duh, anyone could figure that out who's seen only half a trailer! So, if we accept that going in, the only remaining question is does it deliver sufficient entertainment value?

I vote yes.

The far-fetched plot owes a large debt to ""The DaVinci Code"", which itself owes a large debt to a time-honored history of conspiracy theories. Long before ""The DaVinci Code"" was published, I'd heard all sorts of whispered tales about the Knights Templar and the Freemasons - usually involving the Holy Grail, though.

But none of that matters. This is a yarn, pure and simple. As such, it's well told with a good mix of likable and villainous characters, plus at least one you're not too sure about. Should you expect a tall tale to stand up under intense scrutiny? Not bloody likely! To keep you from thinking about the incongruities, it has lots of well-paced action.

This is also a family film. I saw it with 8 other family members ranging from preteen school kids to their grandpa (me). Everyone had a good time and everyone figured we got our money's worth.",1100995200,496,1148,4.696517412935323

1521254,4,B00005JN5E,"Jerry Bruckheimer stands alone as the reigning king of Hollywood producers - not only does he have a combined domestic gross of nearly three billion dollars at the box office but he has stacked up the highest rated shows in television all on one network - Without a Trace, Cold Case, and the three Crime Scene Investigation shows. Unfortunately, his once golden touch is beginning to fade, at least in respects to his feature film division. Bad Boys II, despite being number one at the box office when it opened, failed to make as much as was expected, Veronica Guerin was barely noticed at the Academy Awards, let alone the box office, and King Arthur was another expensive miss for the Walt Disney Company, which had already been wracked with an awful summer prior to its release. The fact that this film has been boiling in the pre-production pot for the past three or four years doesn't bode well for its release, another poor domestic gross would be disastrous for Disney, but if Bruckheimer could make Pirates work despite its extensive problems, there's room for hope.

The story centers on a man who must unlock a series of codes and riddles to unravel the greatest secret in America's history. Imagine for a moment the greatest treasure the world has ever known. Started long ago, this vast amount of gold coins, beautifully crafted sculptures, and historical ancient texts was passed on from one tyrannical dictatorship to the next, from the Egyptians to the Romans and so on, through the ages and, as it did so, the treasure grew with each passing century, until it suddenly vanished. Accidentally discovered by the knights of one of the crusades during the Middle Ages, these men, who would go on to be known as the Knights Template, took an oath to protect the secret of the fantastic treasure at any cost. As European progress began to expand westward, the treasure, along with the keepers of the mystery, were brought to the new world and hidden in America by the Founding Fathers themselves - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin - in order to be kept out of the hands of the British or any oppressive force that would desire it. Jumping forward to the modern day, Benjamin Franklin Gates is a third-generation ""treasure protector"" who has spent all of his life devoted to discovering the mysteries behind the age-old secrets of the national treasure, one his own father believes doesn't exist. Unfortunately, Gates is not the only one who seeks the national treasure and when word gets out about the invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, he must steal the sacred document before it falls into the wrong hands. What he thought was the last clue was only the beginning - one riddle leads to another clue and with each new discovery he draws ever closer to unlocking one of the greatest mysteries in this nation's, as well as the world's, history. The story for National Treasure is not a thing to be concreted on too longingly, though to be true, this one is a bit more of a thinker then the average film of the action-adventure genre, at least in recent months. It is, to be honest, a non-stop action-packed crime capper from beginning to end, though not in the sense of Ocean's Eleven and it's even paced style of play. We're talking mindless destruction, blazing bullets in every direction, and good old-fashioned chase sequences - the basic Bruckheimer package, complete with Nicholas Cage. If you're going for originality and, dare we say it, a bit of class, hold off on this thought until Ocean's Twelve opens in December.

Nicholas Cage, an actor who owes practically his entire career to Jerry Bruckheimer for giving him his first break-out performance in The Rock back in 1996, and then another touted role in Con-Air, fits perfectly into the role even though it does take the character awhile to be comfortable with audiences. Unlike past hero roles in Bruckheimer flicks, the cards are already out on the table for this character - can't blame him too much though, he even says in the film he has a bad bluffing face. There's no emotional build-up for the character in the beginning and doesn't present himself as a natural bad-ass as Indiana Jones did, in certain respects, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Supposedly at one point in the course of writing then re-writing the script for this film, Krueger's character apparently was a central figure in the story's plot - what happened along the way to have this as a result? Abigail Chase adds nothing to the overall effective or efficiency of the storyline besides the whole slightly-subtle romantic subplot between Gates and Chase. Even the whole romantic angle between Nicholas Cage and Diane Krueger feels overly-forced, especially that out of the blue kiss near the end of the film. There's undoubtedly chemistry between the two from what little is seen on screen but there isn't enough time spent on that aspect to go beyond the sped-up version of the usual romantic formula in action flicks - annoying each other to the point of falling in love. Another character that fails to provide much, if any, material to the film was Jon Voight's Patrick Gates, the predictable and doubting father of our leading hero. The character itself is pathetically clichd at worst, an absolute travesty at worst. The father believes the treasure to be a myth and says the son is wasting his entire life, a series of events twist fate, and suddenly he reveals to his son that he has always believed in him - anyone has a Kleenex? This isn't too much of squabble, barely noticeable except for the ending, which seems to be the main source of problems for this film. Here's a question though, with as many revisions as there were for this script, how is it that the ending was still never resolved properly? And finally, where would this film be without Justin Bartha's Riley Poole? An absolute drag, flat from start to finish, but thankfully that doesn't happen. His character is undoubtedly one of the most memorable highlights of the film and works well off-balancing the film's serious moments with sarcastic quips and humorous one-liners.

Overall, National Treasure, when all is said and done, is the equivalent of splicing together the History Channel and FX - yes, it's funny to look at, visually engaging, and, perhaps, insightful into a particular area of study or interest which may be gained along the way but, as is the case with any relationship that that indulges in the concepts of fluff rather then concrete facts, there is bound to be a serious lack of substance. That theory holds true for each and every one of Jerry Bruckheimer's productions, given the exception of his television series on C-BS, but even that may be up for debate. It's not that National Treasure is a horrendous film, it's certainly no Raiders of the Lost Ark or even Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but still it is quite intriguing to say the least, but it undoubtedly lacks some originality and deliverance of results, most notably at the end. The reason the ending fails in its message is that the Founding Fathers didn't have a hippie-dippy view of society - they didn't believe that every human being was inherently born good; in fact they saw the world in quite the opposite way. This alone makes the finale illogical but, as has been said, people aren't expected to look too much into this. Will anyone truly learn anything extraordinary about the Founding Fathers, those who risked life and limb to ensure freedom from oppression and tyranny and to lay the foundation for the fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or, more importantly, anything about America herself? God, no! Please people, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film after all. I will give him credit though, he sure knows one Hell of a way to make an engaging action-caper without having to result to mindless blood-spilling and skin flashing - though he has covered that area as well with the Bad Boys series but that's another story - but do you really expect to have audiences come to his films to be educated? Quite frankly, you'd be lucky to find one gawk-eyed teenager exiting the theater that would be able to recall the name of one of the film's main characters, let alone of the one of the Founding Fathers of the Untied States of America. Then what is redeemable about this film? The musical score is fantastic and blends excessively well with the actions on screen - this has always, and will forever be, a key staple of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, no matter how bad the story is. The action sequences, though formulaic at times, do keep audience members engaged and as long as the interest is there, nothing matters as much in the end. And finally, though it may be historically inaccurate, the National Treasure thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously and can be enjoyed by even those who are easily put to sleep by the History Channel.  In fact, for those with embedded knowledge of the country's founding or any other ancient references throughout the film may even get a kick out of watching this film, whether be lapping up the incorporation of history and mythology or pointing out every single historical mistake present in the feature - whatever floats your boat. Oscar-caliber isn't even in the cards for this film but does anyone going to this film truly expect that type of quality? As always, spend wisely this holiday season.",1100908800,,9446,4.786151960784314
1521255,4,B00005JN5E,"This movie was awesome. The acting was top notch, the script was really great.... y'know when you're watching a pg-rated caper movie, how it just seems like it's missing an element of intesity.... doesn't happen with this movie. Everything sounds and feels like its in just the right place. Definitely recommended if you like movies like The Score, Italian Job, etc. And take your family if the kids are a little older, the content is just fine (pretty cool intensity in some scenes though). Disney definitely turned out a keeper this time around.",1100908800,,547,4.89247311827957
1521256,3,B00005JN5E,"I love watching Gage onscreen, he's an incredible actor, that said, this movie kind of fell into the same catagory as Gone in Sixty Seconds, an under use of talent.  Not nearly the exciting non-stop action that Pirates was, this ""treasure/heist/guy-gets-sexygirl"" flick was entertaining and enjoyable none the less.

Without any hard violence/gore/etc, this movie is indeed a great family type, however, it's story line is way above the heads of little ones, my three year old fell asleep (just for the record she loves P of the C) so I think kids under 6 or 7 will probably be bored.

Unfortunately, due to the attempt to make the movie more appealing to an adult audience (imo) this movie falls short of being capable of becoming a cult classic like the Goonies, but teens with an interest in American history and secret societies and treasure maps will probably enjoy owning it.

It's worth seeing at the theater, and I'm half heartlying (is that even a word?) recommending it as one to own for the family set.",1100822400,12,1013,4.738636363636363
1521257,2,B00005JN5E,"I watched this movie today, and it was not as bad as I was expecting it to be. A treasure map being on the back of the declaration of independence just seems like a silly idea. It was done surprisingly well, though. The ideas seemed almost credible except for the obviously over-done special effects. The clues found on the back of the declaration seemed like something that a druggie during a period of withdrawal would see. I won't say anymore. Worth watching once, but no more.",1100736000,,480,4.593023255813954
1521258,5,B00005JN5E,"The idea for this film is certainly far-fetched, but quite enjoyable and well done for a movie of this genre (i.e., the ""action, adventure, suspense, and humor over substance"" genre).  Nicholas Cage plays his character well as usual, and his comical sidekick is a great humor device.  This movie is pretty much non-stop action from the very start, and the race between ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" combined with running from the FBI kept the suspense going.  The romance bit was on the cheesy side toward the end, and the conflict was too easily resolved once the adventure was over, but these flaws were entirely forgivable given the kind of movie this is.

It may not be a classic, but _National Treasure_ is definitely lots of fun!  I was literally on the edge of my seat.  This is one of those exciting movies that should be seen in the theater - it just wouldn't be the same if you waited for the video to come out.  Not quite as high on my list as Pirates of the Caribbean, but higher than Hidalgo (and I rather liked that movie).  Still good enough for five stars if you like action-adventure and humor and can suspend your disbelief for a while.  Highly recommended.",1100563200,8,1180,4.528301886792453

1521471,3,B00005JN5E,"I'm going to guess that the popularity of ""The Da Vinci Code"" is what spawned this movie.  After a novel and accompanying film about a vast religious conspiracy hidden within the works of Leonardo Da Vinci made it big, it only made sense that there would be some imitators.  ""National Treasure"" seems to be one such imitator, a film about a secret hidden within one of the most prized documents in United States history, albeit one with more positive repercussions than the secret hidden in ""Da Vinci Code.""  The question, of course, isn't whether said secret is true, but whether a movie about this secret would attract audiences.

""National Treasure"" is a fairly standard adventure-thriller, and by no means historically accurate.  But despite its flaws, it still remains enormously entertaining to watch, helped along by Nicholas Cage and his snarky sidekicks.

Nick Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, the latest in a family line that has long been hunting for the Treasure of the Templars, a fantastic collection of valuables and artifacts said to long be safeguarded by the Freemasons and hidden somewhere on the American continent.  After years of fruitless searching, Ben and his assistant, a wisecracking computer nerd named Riley, finally find the first in a series of clues that can hopefully lead them to the treasure.  But when said clue points to one of the United States' most important historical documents -- the Declaration of Independence -- as the map that will finally lead them to the treasure, Ben and Riley's financier turns against them, wanting the treasure at any cost even if it means death or destruction.  With the FBI hot on Ben and Riley's heels and a headstrong (and attractive) archivist tagging along, it falls on Ben to do the unthinkable -- steal the Declaration of Independence, and use the priceless document to navigate among some of America's most historic landmarks to find the treasure before Ian does.

This isn't a film meant to be taken seriously in the least.  It plays fast and loose with historical fact (there are a number of goofs, including just how many people signed the Declaration of Independence in the first place), and relies quite a bit on luck and sheer impossible tricks and technological quirks to support its premise.  That, and while the idea of a secret handed down from the time of the Crusades to the Founding Fathers to the modern-day Freemasons may be a captivating one, in the end it's pretty ridiculous.  HOWEVER, one isn't going to watch a film like this for reasonable explanations and realistic crime capers.  It's meant to be fun, and if the story and action are a little ridiculous, that adds to the fun for a lot of people.  This is a film that knows full well what it is -- an adventure caper with little basis in reality -- and it rarely pretends to be otherwise.

Nicholas Cage is one of those actors who really doesn't act, just plays himself by another name in every movie he's in.  And in this film he's pretty much the same way -- he doesn't become Benjamin Gates so much as Benjamin Gates is just another name Cage goes by in a film.  While that can work against him in a lot of films, here it doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  We're just watching Nick Cage swipe the Declaration of Independence, and the film doesn't require Cage to work too hard to be something he's not in the process.  Justin Bartha (Riley) and Diane Kruger (Abigail, the archivist) pretty much serve as snarky but capable sidekicks in this film, although they do get some of the best lines, and Sean Bean is a somewhat bland but still menacing villain.  Jon Voight is also a bright spot in this film as Ben's father, a skeptic who isn't shy about delivering his opinions of this whole treasure hunt but seems resigned to being dragged into it at some point.

""National Treasure"" is not a great film, but I count it as a guilty pleasure -- it's fairly ridiculous, but it's fun to watch and a delightful bit of escapism.  Nicholas Cage isn't a terrific actor, but he carries this film quite well regardless.  And while the errors and creative license in regards to US history are bound to drive historians and nitpickers nuts, the film as a whole is less concerned with accuracy and more focused on just providing a rollicking adventure.  And in that aspect, it's succeeded.  Watch this film expecting nothing more than some escapist enjoyment, and you won't be disappointed.",1506124800,,4434,4.7558746736292425
1521472,5,B00005JN5E,"A treasure has been passed from had to hand and growing for centuries. The freemasons, last to hold the treasure hid a treasure presumably in the U.S. They did not want the British to get their hands on it during the revolution. The last person with the information on the hiding place is dying and tells the only person near. Now his great grandson Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is determined to find it.

In the effort to find the treasure Ben must team with an unscrupulous person Ian (Sean Bean). Now they are at odds as to how to go about flinging a string of clues. We get to guess along with them and if we are knowledgeable we can stay ahead of them.

Formula story with standard action mixing such things as ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Indiana Jones"". If I were to make one change it would be to exchange Cage's and Bean's characters. Sean Bean looks more the from no one to hero type.

1521595,5,B00005JN5E,"I thought this was a very smart, funny, entertaining movie. In a way I thought of it as an Indiana Jones style of movie, due to the subject and the searching for obscure clues.

The DVD itself was a good presentation ... crisp image ... good sound ... nice anamorphic presentation.

1521677,5,B00005JN5E,"In ""National Treasure,"" Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, a history buff who's convinced there's an invisible treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. To find his way to the greatest riches known to mankind, all he needs are some Q-tips, a blow-dryer and a little lemon juice (paying close attention to those Encyclopedia Brown books sure paid off).
But first, Ben needs to steal the actual document -- not only that, but he needs to steal it in order to save it, because another treasure hunter (an evil one, played by Sean Bean) is chasing it too. And being an Englishman, this evil treasure hunter is likely to take the thing and crumple it into a careless little ball when he's done.
Again the justice side triumphs over evil side!",1483747200,,751,4.654135338345864

1521821,5,B00005JN5E,"I always liked this film. I'll give this the light review, as that's the way I've always 'seen' this film. A fun, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' type of movie - with just the right touch of 'History's Mysteries,' puzzle solving, well-placed action and suspense, and the right moments of light humor and gentle touches.
Cage is a good choice in this lead, as the offbeat, quirky characters are right in the middle of his wheelhouse. The rest of the cast is solid - Sean Bean, Keitel, a nice turn by Jon Voight, the pretty Diane Kruger, and a nice opening moment with legendary Christopher Plummer.
One of my favorite, lazy Saturday afternoon movies - when you're flipping around the dial and looking for something to watch --- this movie always fits in that slot.
Good movie, well made, the story adds up, the music is nice - and the visuals are believable and breathtaking at times. It's a ride - enjoy it.",1478908800,,901,4.533742331288344

It's not the most historically accurate, true, and it's pretty improbable. There's only one female character (bummer).

There are interesting plot twists as the mystery unfolds.  It's worth watching once, and then again in about 3-4 years, and perhaps once again.

1522300,2,B00005JN5E,"Entry-level suspense/action that's careful to paint exclusively by the numbers. Which is to say it's thoroughly safe and predictable from the very beginning, fair play for a Disney-branded family flick. It does let itself get washed away in a late flood of post-9/11 patriotism, but the constant flag-waving and revolution-era set pieces - absurd though they may be - at least give the picture something of a unique identity. It's not the next Tomb Raider though, try as it might, and the actual riddle-cracking/crypt plundering often comes so easily that it all feels redundant and boring. Nic Cage's lead performance varies from intensely awkward to, actually, pretty cool, but he can't completely fight away the urge to overact his heart out in a few late scenes. A strange hybrid of genres and essences, with an even stranger knack for casting decisions, I found it light entertainment at best.",1445904000,,898,5.074324324324325

The team of Cage, Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub can't be beaten for creating movies with great stories, lots of action, and some magical elements.  Nicholas Cage plays the role of the great-grandson in a family that has been obsessed with finding the lost Templar Treasure.  The action takes place in many recognizable public places such as the Library of Congress, several Washington memorials, and some historic sites in Boston.  I especially like the wonderful humor mixed in with the action.  The final scenes are fantastic and fun.",1432252800,6,607,4.97029702970297

It does not even show the beginning of the movie. The quality is beyond substandard. The subtitles cannot be removed at all. We are well aware how to remove subtitles, but it simply will not work with this DVD.  This DVD also does NOT allow you to stop the movie. You have to turn the power off and then hope you hit eject quickly enough before the DVD loads. We own multiple DVD players, as well as computers that play DVDs, and we had the same experiences on each device. This is a junk DVD.

They just seem to spell things out a little bit more then necessary but I guess it is to ensure that everyone is on the same page and can follow the characters train of thought and how they came to these certain conclusions. This is not a Rambo type action but more of an Indiana Jones (intellectual) type action. I like its humor and after seeing the second National Treasure Movie I appreciate the character Riley more in this one. He seems bitter, cynical and greedy to the point of annoyance in the 2nd. I liked his nave charm and silly smugness in the 1st.",1422921600,,694,4.140740740740741

1523165,5,B00005JN5E,"Nicholas Cage is amazing as Ben Gates, a historian who believes that the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map on the back. And while the plot is far fetched it's entertaining! Justin Bartha plays side kick Riley Poole, probably the funniest character in the whole movie! Diane Kruger plays a historian trying to protect the Declaration, and a love interest for Cage. The movie is fast paced, action packed, and entertaining. The history facts aren't always accurate, but that's okay because the movie is so entertaining, and makes history interesting. The two disc collectors edition is nice because it has a couple historical documents, as well as a fun treasure hunt game.

The movie is surprisingly clean, no language, one dead body, and no sexual innuendo. Definitely a fun movie for the whole family. And while I wouldn't recommend watching it with toddlers, only because they probably wouldn't find it entertaining, I would recommend watching it with kids of all ages!",1414540800,,984,5.074074074074074

It has a great story line and is very exciting.  Even though it is over 2 hours, you never notice it.",1393804800,,169,4.25
1523630,4,B00005JN5E,"I've seen this movie a bunch of times but when I was searching for a movie to watch with my 8 year old daughter this one fit the bill perfectly.

She's getting a little too old for all animated movies but with so many R rated movies out there it can be difficult to find a non animated movie that is appropriate for your child to watch that you don't feel you're suffering through.  I also had my daughter in Washington DC for a vacation so the tie in certainly didn't hurt.  There's no sex, little swearing, no f bombs that I remember and no real violence.

It's just a well told action story and who doesn't like those?  Great for all ages.  Wish they made more movies like this!!!

1523735,5,B00005JN5E,"...and it succeeded.  In fact, it became more than an action adventure film with a few intriguing facts about American history peppered into it.  It is a film worth watching over and over again.  Nicholas Cage, Justin Bartha, and Diane Kruger make a great trio of leads and Ms. Kruger especially does a great job playing the straight woman alongside the two treasure hunters.  Jon Voight was great as the father who had given up his son's dream a long time ago and Harvey Keitel makes a great federal agent.  Sean Bean and his motly crew did well at portraying their motives to be purelly greed, making this often overused plot device fit snugly into the plot.  And the action was great and, most importantly, not overdone.  I say ""come for the plot, stay for the great piece of film-making"".  Enjoy.",1389916800,5,800,4.624113475177305

Overall this is a movie along the same genre of DaVinci Code. That is there is some piece of history that most experts have wrong and the answer to all teh unasked questions results in a great upheaval of life as we know it.

I thought this was a fun movie. I enjoyed watching it. It is a great escapist type of movie from the humdrum of every day oife.

1524138,4,B00005JN5E,"At this late date, with the film almost a decade in release and close to 700 reviews, all I can do is come down on the side of the yea-sayers. I found this a delightful movie despite also being a  family movie. I didn't once say to myself, why don't they dirty up the language and undress the heroine, so that we can have some reality and fun. Oh, yes, I don't mind in the least having the F word and its various elaborations in a movie; but, I don't miss them when they are not there. As to naked women (and men), people have enjoyed looking at their images for thousands of years in the world culture America has inherited and I don't know how long in others. I'm all for it when the occasion allows.  Still a pleasant look , speech pattern, and costume does add something to any movie; this one does have these characteristics.
Yes, too, there are illogicalities, borrowings, impossibilities, and a list of other faults, if you are looking to find fault: it you simply want to watch and be entertained, this movie will do it for the average member of the audience. If you need a much stronger dose of  reality, you will  have to go elsewhere.",1369526400,,1145,4.336448598130841

The color is real nice too. As far as the audio goes I can only say that the sound through my external speakers hooked up to my old fashioned stereo system does sound pretty good. This movie has it all - drama, suspense & action. It has quite a few good extra features too, I can't say how the dvd is because I have no reason to watch it. Once you see the Blu-ray version you won't watch the regular version any more. I say go ahead & get this if you like the movie or haven't seen it yet.

1524585,3,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a typical Jerry Bruckheimer film:
Not much substance, but great to watch.

1. CAST.
Whatever your thoughts are on Nicolas Cage, you can't beat a cast that includes:
Jon Voight, Sean Bean, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Plummer.
(Oh, all right, Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, and Justin Bartha are in it too...)
National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets has Helen Mirren and Ed Harris as well.

Among all the cast, Sean Bean and his villainous sidekicks deserve special notice for stealing the scenes.
Every scene.

2. SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.
Unfortunately, while National Treasure is a fun and enjoyable ride, it doesn't just NUKE the fridge so much as dump it in the middle of a nuclear holocaust, then bomb it, blast it, napalm it, and open fire on it.
In other words, National Treasure is fun, only if you don't use your brain.

A good scene to illustrate my point would be the scene where both Cage and Bean try to steal the Declaration of Independence.

Bean's crew:
Drill, Drill, Hammer. Door 1 open.
Hammer, Hammer, Power-tool. Door 2 open.
Chain in the fan, Electric Saw, Drill. Crawl through the fan.
Explosion, Drill, Hammer. Wall knocked down.

Cage's crew:
Tappity Tap Tap. Security Systems Down.
Tappity Tappity: Camera's off.
Tap Tap Tap: Password decoded.
Tappity Tappity Tap: Door open.

Please tell me it's not that easy to steal America's most precious document...
...

It also doesn't just require you to SUSPEND your disbelief... It requires you to HANG it. Forever. Then cut it down and bury it in a box. Then burn the box. Then burn the ashes.

3. CONCLUSION.
While National Treasure is silly, inaccurate, and cliched, it's also really fun, light-hearted, action-packed, (mostly) well-acted, enjoyable, and GREAT TO WATCH - just like a typical Jerry Bruckheimer film.
I give it 3.9 Stars!!!

1524587,5,B00005JN5E,"I'm not a Nic Cage fan, but I can't say he never does good films. In fact, some of his films are amazing. Take National Treasure. This could have been a light-weight Disney version of the hard action pulp of Indiana Jones stories. But it is anything but. This BD is a hole heck of a lot of fun. Digital transfer and audio, yada, yada, yada. Technically, there is little innovation in the film. But when you watch this film, you're watching our American history. And Nicolas Cage is at his most entertaining - anytime he plays a off-beat genius, he's able to channel something I have to give the man credit for.

So, on to the BD itself. We've got commentary, deleted scenes, an alternate ending and a series of featurettes focusing on codes, treasure hunting, and a tonne more. And all the extra goodies are quite a fun watch; nothing's forced or boring at all.

I'm glad I picked it up. If you're one who's fence sitting on upgrading to BD, do it. If the plot isn't quite up to speck, the set design alone is worth the price of admission. Now, if you excuse me, I have a sequel to go and watch.",1338768000,,1095,4.310679611650485

1524593,4,B00005JN5E,"Granted, NATIONAL TREASURE is silliness supreme.  To find the long-lost, priceless treasure of the Free Masons, one must steal the Declaration of Independence (there are clues on the back, don't you know).  There's also an antique pipe that opens secret passages, valuable clues in the letters of a young Benjamin Franklin, and the clue to discover when to go up into the Tower at Independence Hall is on none other than the hundred dollar bill.  I confess, I couldn't think this kind of zaniness up if I went on a month-long bender, but I'm sure glad the creative minds behind NATIONAL TREASURE did.  This is one fun ride, from one thrilling moment to the next, and the beauty of it all is the movie never takes itself seriously--so why should the viewer?

Nicolas Cage can often corner the market on annoyance, but here he's wonderfully cast as notorious historian Benjamin Gates.  Ben has basically sacrificed his life to find the Free Masons treasure--plus restore his family's good name--and he's not about to let such trivial obstacles as stealing the Declaration stand in his way.  Cage dead pans his lines and deals matter-of-factly with any road blocks that constantly pop up, plus he plays smartly off comedic sidekick Justin Bartha.  Once Diane Kruger joins the treasure team playing a dedicated official of the Library of Congress, NATIONAL TREASURE gets up and moves, as our protagonists avoid the FBI (led by a smug Harvey Keitel) while simultaneously racing a determined villain (Sean Bean is stellar) to find the treasure first.  And any movie that features legendary thespian Jon Voight (as Cage's doubting father) sports an instant advantage in my book, and here Voight is as solid as ever.  Again, it's silly and nonsensical and hopelessly lame, but who cares?  NATIONAL TREASURE is one heart thumping grand ride.

Although the Knights Templar Treasure is a huge debate, no one knows where it is. Or if it even exists, but this movies is fun, alittle over the top. But all in all, Disney found a way to a treasure movie and teach history at the same time. A good movie to sit down to and watch, there is chemistry between all the characters. And the fact that they take you to all the historical places, liberty hall, library of congress, just awsome.

1524692,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure(released Nov/04)is an exceptionally engaging film which combines many elements of cyrptology,archeology,symbology,legends and half truths regarding the Masons and Knights Templar and all shaken and stirred into an Indiana Jones ""glass"".It contains a good solid cast of actors and coupled with Jon Turteltaub's taught directing skills this film is a clear winner.
The story involves one Ben Gates(Nick Cage)whose family has been guarding a passed down secret of a huge long lost treasure for generations. Finally getting a financial backer one Ian Howe(Sean Bean),they travel to the Arctic to uncover a long lost ship which contains a clue. The clue tells Ben the next important piece of the puzzle lies on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Howe tells him that he can obtain the document and this is the moment Ben realizes he has hooked up with the wrong people. A skirmish ensues and the ship blows up leaving Ben and a friend stranded,having to walk to the nearest settlement to be rescued.
Back in New York Ben visits several law enforcement agencies in an effort to alert them of what is coming. No one believes him and he decides in order to protect the valuable document he will steal it himself. Amazingly this is what he does with both the law and Howe on his tail. Mixed up in this is the curator of the the National Archives in Washington Dr. Chase(Diane Kruger).She inadvertently has to go on the run with Ben and they end up at the home of his father Patrick(Jon Voight),who has been a skeptic of the entire legend all his life. Ben finds his code and it makes a now skeptical believer out of Dr Chase also. When his father discovers what his son really has he is beside himself. In order to keep his father out of the situation however they tie him up and leave him just as the FBI shortly thereafter arrives at the house.
Howe is always dogging Ben and company's footsteps as they travel to Independence Hall in Philly. There they find a strange pair of bi-focals with which to view the back of the Declaration. The treasure they seek is under the old Trinity Church back in NYC.The FBI at one point lays a trap for Ben and for his pursuers Mr. Howe,but Ben manages to escape with the help of Howe who now has his friend,Dr Chase and his father captive. They all travel to the Church and discover a huge grotto which they descend. At the bottom is a room with nothing in it. Ben's father tells Howe the next clue lies in the North Tower in Boston,which is where Howe heads leaving the group stranded. However it is a false clue and Ben discovers an ante room which contains the real treasure. It is filled with thousands of years worth of artifacts and history. When the group re-enters the Church above the FBI swoops in. They are looking for fall guys and Ben gives them Howe and his men at the Church in Boston. As Ben wanted,the treasure/discovery is released to a museum in Cairo for the benefit of all mankind.
Once the movie establishes its premise the action seems to flow non stop throughout and the 130 minutes flies by very fast. Not only is the direction here very good,the editing of the film is fantastic and gives a greater impact to those moments which otherwise would have lagged. Cage,Voight,Bean,Kruger,Keitel(as an FBI man),et al turn in very good performances in their respective parts.
The movie is presented in its' widescreen 2:33:1 aspect ratio and the transfer is crisp and clean. Extras include a behind the scene featurette,deleted scenes,an alternate ending,director movie commentary, Knights Templar and ""Treasure Hunters revealed"" featurettes,an animatic of the opening scene(an animated storyboard)and some puzzle challenges(each special feature has a letter code to it).
All in all a highly recommended action packed film which is suitable for everyone's enjoyment.

Not bad, not great, NT is a good flick for kids not old enough to see Raiders of the Lost Ark (however old that is). It's Disney/Bruckheimer, which portends the level of gloss; strange to see Disney working with JB, well-known in Hollywood for savagely beating his many high-priced call girls. But you don't have to have morals to sell morality, fortunately for most of that town, and this flick subtly pushes all sorts of mythology while simultaneously mocking what it purports to celebrate.

Trevor Rabin's score has some fine moments, and nothing is exceptionally poor here, but then nothing is exceptionally fine either, except perhaps the set design, which has some highlights. Cage is typically good but not great, though Voight and Plummer do add some gravitas to the proceedings. There are many egregious continuity issues with the script's factual details, but hey, don't look too closely at the man behind the curtain...

NT is predictably manipulative, with the music telling us what to feel if the script doesn't do it well enough, and if you're looking for vaguely exciting Saturday night mindnumbing, this could pass. All in all, good fun for those who like to believe that the Masonic and Templar theories etc have no truth to them and that all in American history is as we read in the history books.

Let's be sincere. The film begins with a breathtaking and unstoppable display of energy. There are many historical aspects in game and the search of this treasure was a guarantee to make us experience a major doses of histamine and creativeness.

But the plot pitifully shifted to commonplaces. Good guys and bad guys. A beautiful girl involved and a web of tied events. But since the document is stolen, it would seem the plot deflated.

Car chases, expected situations to conclude into a scene that doesn't generate major enthusiasm.

I must admit the cast is impressive. Nicolas Cage, Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel save the movie from sinking.

1524984,3,B00005JN5E,"Capitalizing on its Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Disney tried for gold again with 2004's National Treasure. The intelligent and ambitious vehicle has not gone on to as much success as Pirates. Nevertheless, National Treasure is ideal for tweens interested in a thinking person's movie.

Acclaimed film veteran Christopher Plummer opens the tale, telling his young grandson Ben Gates how their family holds a vital clue in finding a vast treasure brought to the New World by the Knights Templar and protected by Free Masons from the British. Hidden and since lost from memory, Ben (Nicholas Cage) spends his adult life searching for the treasure, despite his father's (Jon Voight) bitter realization that the treasure is no more than a myth. After the discovery of a ship buried in the Artic Circle, Ben realizes the next clue found there suggests the treasure map is on the back of the Declaration of Independence.

To stop his former business partner Ian Howe (Sean Bean) from stealing and destroying the Declaration, Ben and his understudy Riley steal the Declaration first. After interfering with their plans, historian Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) insists on coming along to ensure the protection of the invaluable document. With Ian and FBI investigator (Harvey Kietel) on their trail, the trio travels from Washington to Philadelphia and New York, gathering clues and searching for the treasure.

The premise of National Treasure is more intelligent that most, but it is ambitious and not fully executed. Trying to ride the Da Vinci Code tail, National Treasure resorts to basic exposition on American history with some fantastical turns tossed in along the way. The script is too broad and witty in the wrong places. Intellectual teens or history fans will no doubt dig Treasure, but for smarter adults, the movie doesn't hold many repeat viewings. The first time around, the Declaration heist, Philadelphia chase, and New York underground escape only go so far, and eventually, plot holes take center stage.

Often shown on broadcast and basic cable channels, National Treasure is only worth a second or third view for the cast. Justin Bartha as Riley has most of the amusing moments as the sarcastic sidekick. His deadpan style is offbeat and more refreshing than if the role was set up with a blatant laugh track. Likewise, Nicholas Cage is clearly having fun with the role. The Oscar winner and action star surely has his pick of material, so after dark pictures like his award winning turn in Leaving Las Vegas, and more recently Snake Eyes and 8mm, Cage delivers his historical wit with a lighthearted manner his fans will no doubt enjoy. Relative newcomer Diane Krueger (Troy) fits the bill as Doctor Chase.

All the secondary characters are under written and not properly showcased- the talented actors behind them do as much as they can within the script. Krueger is the pretty but brainy and clearly attracted to Ben, and Harvey Keital (Pulp Fiction) is the scary FBI agent who really isn't all that scary and in fact helpful stereotype. Villain veteran Sean Bean (Patriot Games, Goldeneye, Don't Say A Word) suffers greatly as the clich&eacute;d European unobstructed bad guy bent on acquiring the treasure simply because he can. Bean's sublte threats on Riley's sidekick are some of the better played scenes in the film.

Whether he was made up to look older or was unwell during filming, Jon Voight does not look well as Patrick Gates. Although the relationship between the father and son is a big part of National Treasure, the script does little to add to the oft-told scenario. Voight seems tired as the Old Dad-perhaps that is his award winning acting range, but for someone who was also once a respected Historian, Dad's left with clich&eacute;d phrases and glib remarks. The only thing I found rewarding in the Voight and Cage duo is that Cage was in Gone in Sixty Seconds with Voight's real life daughter Angelina Jolie and they, of course, aren't speaking to each other.

The scope of National Treasure is also a bit presumptuous for someone who has grown up in the areas in which the film takes place. Although the Declaration heist is very vague and undefined in most places, it also gives away real facts and science. Would the powers that be really let a movie show how to steal the Declaration of Independence? Likewise, the Philadelphia locales are taken somewhat out of context. The elaborate double chase through Philadelphia takes the audience on a course that isn't actually possible through the city. One notices these things after multiple viewings, but younger audiences will take the substitution of story for van chases and death defying avalanches, which in the end, was probably Disney's intention.

Yes, I've been harsh on National Treasure, and I don't expect you to see it ten times like I have, but I expected more from a big vehicle backed with a lot of money and starring Nicholas Cage and Sean Bean. Female fans will most definitely watch for them, but National Treasure is more for young conspiracy fans interested on loose coincidences and facts about Benjamin Franklin. History teachers might benefit from a viewing followed by a fact or fiction discussion and trip to Philadelphia, but I don't think that's what Disney had in mind when they launched their massive contests and treasure chances with the film's box office release.

National Treasure is available on DVD with some fun extras for the kids, and the film has been popular enough to warrant a sequel. National Treasure: Book of Secrets is currently filming. Focusing on the mysterious surrounding The Lincoln assassination, I don't see how it could top the original if it tries to stretch its tiny premise against the original's well, national attempts.

More intelligent than The Mummy, and most definitely better than The Scorpion King, National Treasure is the young man's Indiana Jones.",1229299200,,5914,5.001016260162602
1524985,2,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure (Jon Turteltaub, 2004)

I had always remembered National Treasure as being something of a flop, so I was very confused last year when its sequel actually got a theatrical release. It was, of course, laughed out of theaters after only a few weeks, as I suspected given my memories of the reviews of the original, but it did convince me to sit down and actually watch the original to see if I'd missed anything. I didn't.

The ludicrous plot concerns Ben Gates (Nic Cage in yet another role he really had no business playing), a treasure hunter who decides that, like his grandfather (Christopher Plummer), he's going after the biggest treasure of them all: the wealth accumulated by those Founding Fathers who were members of the Illuminati. (Well, okay, they're not called the Illuminati in the movie, but everyone knows the tall tales about the pyramid on the dollar bill, etc., right?) Set up against Gates is an old partner of his, Ian Howe (Sean Bean), and the curator of the National Archive, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She's not fond of him because, supposedly, one of the clues is on the back of the Declaration of Independence. (This isn't a spoiler because it was, after all, the subject of most of the movie's trailers.) Also against him is his own father (Jon Voight), who gave up all that treasure-hunting nonsense, and expected his kid to do the same. Ah, fathers, why do they never learn that the family business skips a generation? In any case, all this leads to a great number of car chases and near-falls into bottomless pits and the like as Gates and Howe race to get to the treasure first.

I get the feeling that Turteltaub (whose last really good movie--and this is arguable--was 1993's Cool Runnings) had a vision in his head of this being a kind of American-centered history lesson in the tradition of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. After all, Gates and Howe hit all the big historical sites, and there's all sorts of great footage of the Liberty Bell, the National Archives, that sort of thing. But Bill and Ted's effectiveness, and its continuing charm, come from the history lessons being delivered with more than a smidgen of humor. And yes, the script here--adapted by Jim Kouf (Rush Hour) from his own story idea--does make some lame attempts at humor, but in general, especially during the action scenes, it takes itself way, way too seriously.

Having said all that, it's not an entirely awful movie. The action sequences are a lot of fun when they're not wallowing in action-sequence clich&eacute; (do we really need one more scene of someone hanging off the open back door of a van during a high-speed chase?), and the script does manage a few clever moments, but overall it's something to catch on late-night TV when you're suffering from insomnia. Nic Cage as an action hero is enough to put anyone to sleep. **",1228521600,,2872,4.749498997995992

Well, as much as I would love to have my quote on a movie trailer, I don't think I'll make the cut with ""Dang--this movie is solid!""

But that's exactly what National Treasure is. It's a well-crafted mystery, a gripping action yarn, and the most entertaining (if not entirely accurate) American history lesson I've ever had. Part conspiracy theory, part Indiana Jones-style treasure hunt, there's plenty here for most everyone--especially if you happen to enjoy the history of the Declaration of Independence.

Because Jerry Bruckheimer produced it, it feels like a Bruckheimer movie, with sweeping aerial shots and bombastic music by regular collaborator Trevor Rabin, but director Jon Turteltaub, thankfully, doesn't share Michael Bay's love affair with excess. Chase scenes are never overlong or needlessly complicated, and while there are several opportunities for Nicolas Cage to pose for Bay's signature circular dolly shot (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Boys/dp/B00004STUL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Boys</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock/dp/6304711891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock</a>, for example), Turteltaub prefers to keep the story moving rather than take precious time to worship his lead actor.

1524988,3,B00005JN5E,"I remember playing this game during orientation in college. The seniors would hide clues all over the campus. Each clue leads to another and finally, the treasure.

National Treasure is a game of sorts - the kind played during freshmen orientation, except that it's on a much grander scale, involving the theft of the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage stars as a descendent of the Gates family whose ancestor holds the key to a national treasure. None of his forefathers succeeded in finding the treasure but Cage's character (named Benjamin Gates) was determined to uncover the mystery.

He first locate the Charlotte, a boat that contained a clue to the treasure. The next clue was to be found on the back of the Declarartion of independence and Ben suggested to one of his treasure hunting partners that the only way to see what's on it is to steal it. Ben was against stealing, but the resourceful villian didn't care. So he reasoned that in order to protect the document from the villian, why not let me the good guy steal it first and while the document is in my hands, I might as well take a peek on what's on the back. He tried warning the FBI but nobody believed him. As a final resort, we went to the beautiful Abigail Chase at the National Archives who also didn't believe him. No choice, Ben had to steal it.

Sounds silly? Well, it is. But the action is so well choreographed that if you can suspend your disbelief for a moment, you may actually enjoy watching it. Ben steals the document so the bad guys couldn't get it. Somehow, Abigail Chase got dragged into the whole saga. After seeing the hidden message behind the Declarartion of Independence, she was convinced that Ben Gates was on to something and she joined his team. The FBI and villians went after them. Everybody went around in circles with lots of shooting and suspense.

Well, one clue leads to another. They ended up on Wall Street, inside a church, under a niche which led the way to what seemed like a very deep mine shaft. There was no treasure at the bottom. Another clue. Or so it seemed. Somehow, the stupid bad guys were tricked into leaving for the treasure at Boston while the good guys finally found it.

A happy ending. Ben didn't have to go to jail. Not a bad movie to watch but don't bother to buy the DVD or take it too seriously. I watched it on TV. Wouldn't have been worth the cinema ticket.",1225584000,,2397,4.513824884792626
1524989,4,B00005JN5E,"Who would not wonder at the idea of stealing a national treasure?  Ever since ""The Da Vinci Code"" was published, much has been said about the Knights Templar and the existence of a magnanimous treasure, sometimes with religious implications, sometimes, as is the case in ""National Treasure"", just related to pure mutiny.  I was never a fan of American history, yet this movie has managed to lit up my interest in it.

The story centers around Benjamin Franklin Gates, a role impersonated by Nicolas Cage.  A descendant of THE Benjamin Franklin, historian, engineer and Navy ROTC Ben Gates is on a quest after a family's life pursuit about the ancient treasure of the Knights Templar, that somehow seems to have found its way to America during the Revolutionary War, and was hidden in this land by the Freemasons who, among others, counted the names of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin himself as members.  But the Gates family has been the laughing stock of the historical community in Washington D.C. for generations due to the elusiveness of said treasure.  Just when Ben Gates appears to have found someone rich enough and willing to fund a costly search that includes an expedition to the Arctic, Ben realizes that not everyone has the same solemn intentions as he does when it comes to finding the greatest treasure ever coveted by mankind.  For starters, the clues leading to its discovery are to be found in the Declaration of Independence... but how does one get to it and, more importantly, how can the clues be interpreted?  Ben has his friend and co-conspirator Riley Poole, played by hilarious Justin Bartha, and National Archives expert Dr. Abigail Chase (played by Diane Kruger) as his right and left hands to help him.

This is the premise of ""National Treasure"", a movie which unpacks fun and loads of action while taking the viewer on location to the National Archives and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, and the catacombs under Trinity Church in New York City.

I have enjoyed it immensely, especially the historical aspect.  Although the acting is not stellar by any means, one must admit that Sean Bean still offers a fantastic view of the human male species even when he is getting on years, and the feminine element offered by Diane Kruger as Dr.  Chase is... cute, though sometimes borderline callous.

True to a Jerry Bruckheimer production, the film offers great photography, and the 2-disc Collector's Edition is jam-packed with extras presented in the form of a treasure hunt, my favorites being ""Riley's Decode This!"", with three levels of discovery; and the featurette on ""Ciphers, Codes & Codebreakers"", a great documentary on code making and breaking that goes back to the first World War.  The deleted scenes offer much needed background to the film, although it is understandable how they did not make it into it - at 2:35 hours, nothing else could go in.",1224720000,,2959,4.927565392354125

1525033,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is literally an unbelievable adventure.  There are so many gaping holes in the plausibility of the plot that you must simply suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie.  If you can do that, you will be greatly entertained.  What more can you ask of a movie?

First, let's deal with some criticisms.  Is it a rip-off of Dan Brown's ""The DaVinci Code""?  Sure!  The timing of the movie, the hidden clues beneath seemingly straight-forward public documents/paintings, and the secret society protecting its great treasure... we'll drop the word 'rip-off' and use 'influenced by' instead.

Does the movie require either the bad guys or the authorities to act naively in order to progress the story?  Yep.  However we have seen news stories frequently where crooks and lawmen have acted much more foolishly than the characters in this story.

Can anything in this movie be accepted as believable?  Well, that's up to you.  The pyramid with the glowing eye thing on a $1 bill seems pretty goofy to me, and the guys who dreamed that one up (our Founding Fathers) might be capable of just about anything.  We know that the period around the American Revolution was full of secret societies and codes, handshakes, and ways to signify a rebellious spirit.  Streets were named backwards, place settings at meals were opposite from the British standard, and documents were hidden in trees, in back of mirrors, and other interesting places.  Check your attic!

Would the greatest treasures in the world be directed to an uncivilized colony in turmoil?  Probably not.  However, where would you bury treasure?  In the middle of a busy city?  The more you think about it the more plausible the partially civilized American colonies become for a hiding place.

But none of that matters in the least.  The movie exists to entertain you.  It does that well.  Jon Voight is probably the most believable character when you learn that he spent 20 unproductive years chasing clues.  His bitterness is well presented, as is his intelligence once he buys back into the dream.  He's pretty annoying at times though.

Diane Kruger does as well as she can with the limited role she's given.  'Get in the way, screw things up, fall in love'.  It is an old movie cliche.  The role calls for her to be complicating eye candy, and she fills the role well.

Sean Bean has the obsessed villain role, and he excels.  He makes a couple of implausible decisions, but if you understand that he is driven by money and not simply bad, it makes more sense.  He wants the treasure.  If he has to kill to get it, okay.  If he can get it without killing, that won't bother him.  He believes he is immune from getting caught, and that allows Nicholas Cage to live.

Mr. Cage.  His sincerity, his obsession to solve the family mystery, his respect for American history, and his high regard for the lives of his friends are completely believable.  He makes a few story-advancing bozoisms, such as having a nice chat with Abigail Chase outside the red van knowing that a group of killers are going to show up at any minute looking to make swiss cheese of him.  Note to self: if a guy with a gun is chasing you, never climb scaffolding.  For an intelligent guy, that move alone should have off'd him years ago.  And where is he getting all of the money he needs to pay for all of the adventures and trinkets?  The George Washington election badge alone would require that he hold down at least a manager position at the neighborhood McDonald's.  Or better.

Okay, nobody donates stuff to museums without at least getting a copy of it.  And the museum wouldn't display all of the letters, but would more likely display one or two and store the rest.  Trifles, trifles.

Does the movie entertain?  Yes.  Is it worth buying?  Yes.  Should you buy ""The DaVinci Code"" instead?  No.  The book was exciting and thought-provoking.  The movie ""The DaVinci Code"" was very disappointing.  The movie checked off the clues as it went along, and remained as faithful to the book as it could, but it lacked the spirit of the quest that ""National Treasure"" captured.  I viewed both movies expecting to love ""The DaVinci Code"" and dismiss ""National Treasure"" as a wanna-be.  Instead, I loved ""National Treasure"", and found that the movie ""The DaVinci Code"" was the wanna-be for the book.  Do I believe either one?  Hey, I buy a lotto ticket each week.  I'll believe anything!",1218585600,,4435,4.7176470588235295

The action here is almost non-stop, the jokes and asides are often clever, and the cast has enough chemistry that the non-action sequences don't drag. Jon Turteltaub directs with a steady hand, as the whole movie, at two hours, rushes by at lightening speed. It's a snappy enough pace that you don't question little things, like 200 year old ropes that still hold or being able to steal the Declaration of Independence.

Nicholas Cage leads the likable band of thieves, but special note is given to Justin Bartha, who plays sidekick Riley, and to the early cameo by Christopher Plummer, who plays Cage's Grandfather at the beginning of the film. The both take otherwise easily forgettable roles and make them perfect. Cage plays BF Gates like a slightly less charming Indiana Jones (or a skinnier Tom Hanks in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code)</a>, both films providing the sanitized source material for ""National Treasure.""

So relax, grab the popcorn and let the kiddies join you. ""National Treasure"" is a friendly film where the villains are evil but not deadly, the heroes are lovable yet chaste, and everybody has a happy ending...even if Riley has to settle for 1%.",1217635200,,1825,5.2646048109965635

1525037,4,B00005JN5E,"My first exposure to National Treasure was actually the sequel, National Treasure 2. So I had to go back and see how it all started.

This movie is an extremely well done, albeit short, flick that has some good humor and history behind it that makes it one of my favorites. It's not conspiratorial, although the idea behind the movies that certain centuries old mysteries can be solved is really intriguing. This movie follows the traditional story that the treasure the Templar Knights found was passed from them to the Freemasons who hid it to keep it from the British during the American Revolution. I'm not certain all of the history they included is correct, but unless you go looking for errors it doesn't make that much difference and the speculation about the treasure is believable in my opinion. If it is correct, there are some really interesting tidbits in here about the founding of New York and the history of the founding fathers. Nicholas Cage gives an extremely believable performance and has a few funny lines to boot. It's one of the best roles he's done in my opinion.

And I must admit, I had never been interested in the National Treasure series. I had the impression they were big, dumb movies. But after searching long and hard for a movie my 9-year-old would enjoy I realized these films are PG, don't rely on potty jokes for their humor, don't have gobs of sexual content and don't show kids being bratty and acting superior to every adult in the film. These movies are great for children not old enough to watch PG-13, but who are too old for films like The Tigger Movie. The plots are about educated people trying to do the right thing and are a perfect mix of action, humor and suspense. It was a joy to watch my son watching these movies.

The plot is great and the actors are awesome! I really enjoyed watching this movie. I even watched the second one and still liked the first one a little better! That's how good it is.

1525082,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is about this treasure that has been passed down from generation to generation by famous people in history, like our Presidents. The movie starts out when Benjamin Franklin Gates was a kid. He is in Washington D.C. in his grandfathers basement. He stumbles into a book about the treasure. Then his grandfather finds him in the basement and he asks him what he is looking at. Ben tells him its about some treasure. By the way, the name of the treasure is  The Kinghts of the Templar's treasure. He tells Ben that last signer of the constitution that was alive was about to die, he wanted to tell the President, Andrew Jackson about the treasure but, when he got to the White House President Jackson wasn't there so he told his coach boy Thomas Gates that there is a treasure that is in a secret place and with his dying breath he told that the secret lies with Charlotte. Then Ben's grandfather tells him that treasure existed during egyptian times, During the  christian crusades some of the crusaders took the treasure with them. Then it was brought over to America by the Knights of the Templar and During the Revolutionary war the British went looking for the treasure by looking for the clues. The Knights of the Templar in America began to be called Free Masons. People that were Free Masons were Geogre Washington,Thomas Jefferson,Benjamin Franklin,Paul Revere,John Adams, and John Hanncock. Then at the end of the story Ben's grandfather gives him a piece of paper with the clue the secret lies with Charolate on it. Then he tells him to use clue to look for the treasure. Then Ben asks him if he can be a knight like the Templar Knights. His grandfather then knights him. Then his father comes in and tells him to stop listening to his grandfather about the treasure nonsense. His father's name is Patrick and he has been looking for the treasure for years but he has never found it. Then the movie shifts to the Artic to the present where Ben, now and adult, is looking for Charlotte. This movie is great. The bonus featrues are puzzle games,a making of the movie documentary, and bloopers. This is a movie you don't want to miss. I am a History lover so I was interested in this movie and National Treasure (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) made me like History even more.",1213747200,,2344,4.605263157894737
1525083,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a fast paced action picture with enough substance to keep non-action fans interested.

Nicolas Cage is great. He wasn't the worlds first choice in action heroes, but he brings intelligence to the role, which NT needs in the star.  It's nice to see actors as action heroes, like Cage here or Robert Downey Jr. in Ironman, rather than just movie stars. It was great to see Sean Bean in another major role (he was great as Boromir). He brings credibility to the villain role.

Diane Kruger was fine, save for one scene where her accent went from its normal hard-to-spot to suddenly very thick. Still, her role was potentially unbelievable, and she was up to the task. A lesser actress could have spoiled the film. Join Voigt was fine, as were ""the rest"".

But the best guy in the film was Justin Bartha, Mr. normal person making the brains look good.  He had many of the best lines in the film and should be working more.

NT does a fine job of making a potentially hokey plot work. The science/history is always enough to keep our disbelief firmly suspended, but never enough to make us think we're in a lecture hall. Finally, NT is frequently hilarious. There are more laughs here than in many comedies released this year.

That's like asking Hannibal Lecter to play Big Bird... it doesn't match and it comes across as goofy as slap stick comedy.

The cast is great, the landscape is brilliant and the mysteries of the early American empire are all on display. My one regret is that the collection of the treasure is not explained. How did all of those wonderful objects become part of American holdings?

To the truth of the matter, most of the founding fathers and noblemen even before, were traveled men of great wealth. Still, with so much being described and the great lack of knowledge of our own people about their past, I would have loved more details shared with the masses on ""the scrolls from the library at Alexandria""....

It is a heavy burden describing the past to movie goers, and I do hope that the series that National Treasure is bound to become takes that role seriously by providing truthfulness and accuracy while at the same time, taking us on a wild ride.

1525345,3,B00005JN5E,"Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is searching for a treasure that has been hidden in America for hundreds of years, but was actually protected for millennia prior to that.  It turns out that some of the founding fathers were in on the conspiracy and scattered clues that would lead to the treasure if interpreted correctly.  Also on the trail is Ian Howe (Sean Bean), a criminal who will stop at nothing to get the treasure for himself.  The search begins in the arctic ice, but quickly moves on to a plan to steal the Declaration of Independence... but that's only the beginning of the hunt.

It's hard to overstate how silly a movie National Treasure is.  The absurdities and inaccuracies are so numerous that a viewer must decide to ignore them completely and just go along for the ride or just stop watching the whole mess to avoid rampant frustration.  There is a crazy level of energy and the ride is fun in its own kooky way.  Most of the performances, especially Bean and Cage, are good and there's plenty of humor mixed in with the action.  I wouldn't strongly recommend the film to anyone, but those looking for a mindless romp could do worse.",1198627200,,1159,4.619512195121951
1525346,3,B00005JN5E,"I admit I enjoyed watching this movie in the theater, but still left with a feeling that it missed something. Rewatching the movie on this 2 disc special edition reminds me of the same feeling. The story is of Nicolas Cage's character having to ""steal"" the Declaration of Independence to save it from a selfish treasure hunter who only wants to use it to find a legendary treasure hidden by the forefathers of our country. What are the pluses? The fantastic location shoots; Washington DC, Boston, and Philadelphia. How exciting it is to be ""inside"" the tower of Independence Hall where the Liberty Bell once rang? Or inside the historic monuments and buildings of our nation's capitol? Diane Kruger is well cast as Abigail Chase; you believe her dilemma in choosing between protecting the Declaration and wanting to see whether the mythical treasure actually exists or not. Justin Bartha creates a memorable character of Riley, Nicolas Cage's brainy yet funny assistant. There are a number of exciting chase sequences as well, but leading us to the flaw side...I just found the movie to be somewhat lacking. In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" one can feel the excitement of the opening of the Ark or any of the other things that Indiana Jones finds along the way. The buildup here is poor. Nicolas Cage's character goes quickly from A to Z in his think-out-loud explanations of the clues, and the string of logic is very hard to believe. I like a good suspend-your-belief type movie as well as the next guy, but this flick really pushes the envelope...too much. This movie borrows from a lot of other action/chase and treasure hunt movies, mixes the elements together, but ends up with something that is less than satisfying. And the worst part is Cage himself. It was very difficult for me to believe his character through the movie; Cage doesn't so much act; he poses, gestures, and attempts to sound very intellectual. It fails for me, as I can't get past his perfectly coiffed hairplugs and fake dental work. His look does not ring true to the character he should be playing and it stands out like a sore thumb. It's also hard to believe any kind of romantic feelings on his part towards the Abigail character, as Cage almost comes off as a robot. It's a fair movie with great production values and visuals, but storywise it is just passable.

The special features include a number of short featurettes; few are very indepth, and leave you with a sense of ""That's all?!?"" Each barely touches on the subject it covers. The ""NT on Location"" featurette was interesting in that you learn that the majority of what you see in the film was actually filmed on location (Independence Hall) with the exception of most of the National Archives sequences. There are a few deleted scenes to watch, and most were removed with good reason. The opening scene Animatic gives you a rough look of the opening sequence and you can  learn the intentions of Jon Turteltaub, the director. The alternate ending is also shown here; again, a wise choice was made, although it is difficult to believe Turteltaub when he states that they had no thoughts of doing a sequel when they were making this. The ""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" is (again) a short look at treasure hunting at sea and on land, focusing on the Mel Fisher collection in Key West, ending up with little kids combing beaches with metal detectors. How do you make a movie about stealing the Declaration of Independence, and then compare it to hunting coins on a beach? A true documentary on treasure hunts and greatest finds would have been a natural. This featurette is weak at best. Same case with ""The Knights of Templar"" featurette, which uses mainly clips from the film and very uninformative narration that leaves you with more questions than it answers. You can also watch the filming and thought behind the explosion of The Charlotte, the ship that was supposed to be frozen in the Arctic, but was actually shot on a soundstage and in Park City, Utah. You can also see how the creators of the film came about their method for stealing the Declaration of Independence. Originally, the documents antiquated 1957 security system allowed for a very easy explanation; 9/11 changed all that and the method had to be replanned by the film crew. Actually, in the film, this is probably the most plausible and well thought out premise of the film; the following of clues to find the treasure is where they should have spent more time!

There is also a featurette on Ciphers and Codes, which allow you to play some decoding games, too. And yes, you'll have to play these as well as watch all the featurettes to be able to totally access alll the ""hidden"" featurettes. I'm not a big fan of this stuff...give me the featurettes to watch when I want to watch them. If I had time to play video games, it would be one with better thought behind it than the ones here on the disc.

1525351,2,B00005JN5E,"How did Nick Cage become an actor? I really can't stand this guy. In every movie he's ever been in, every line he says sounds like he just woke up from a deep sleep. He is a terrible, terrible actor. Watching him is painful.

With that said, National Treasure is a movie about the greatest treasure on earth, hidden by America's Founding Fathers who were also members of the Lucifer worshipping cult known as 'The Free Masons'.

Anyone with a brain or an inkling of history knows that Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Paul Revere, John Adams, John Hanncock, and the rest of the Founding Fathers were freely shackled to the chains of Satan by surrendering their eternal souls to Free Masonary. Washington DC is one of the most evil cities in all the world. It is shaped in a pentagram and is has demonic symbols and statues littered throughout the city. America was founded on the sick minds of the Free Masons who drank blood, raped animals, and worshipped their evil masters who reign in hell. I would not be surprised to discover that George Washington himself had sodomized Benjamin Franklin with a flaming torch as he spoke The Lord's Prayer backwards.

As far as the movie goes, it is totally believeable, because America is a greedy country that hoardes stolen treasure and it's most sacred documents like the Declaration of Independence are thinnly disguised papers of witchcraft and evil.

Nicholas Cage again must bore us with his monotone acting, his expressionless deadpan face, those eyebrows that someone needs to burn off, and deadpan excuse for acting. C'mon folks face it, this guy couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.

Being a Disney movie, this is a G rated version of what would really happen in this situation. No one gets shot, there is no blood, and there is of course no nudity.

This movie is pretty lame and as usual Nicholas Cage sucks.",1193356800,,1893,4.738601823708207

1525383,4,B00005JN5E,"Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage) has spent his whole life searching for the famous Knights Templar Treasure, which is supposed to be a priceless collection of artifacts and gold. As Ben and his friends get closer to finding the treasure, they face multiple challenges, including a nasty enemy (Sean Bean) intent on finding the treasure and keeping it all for himself, and a team of FBI agents (led by Harvey Keitel) who are after Ben for committing the minor infraction of stealing the Declaration of Independence. The film is full of suspenseful chases and an exciting treasure hunt that keeps the audience guessing until the very end.

It's true that this movie is completely unrealistic and also rather silly at times, but it's also a lot of fun and provides quality entertainment: I don't think there's anyone out there that wouldn't relish in the idea of such a large-scale treasure hunt. The one thing about the film that bugged me was the character of Abigail (Diane Kruger), who works at the National Archives and ends up assisting Ben and his partner Riley (Justin Bartha) in their quest. I could buy the fact that Abigail would refuse to let Ben take off with the Declaration of Independence in hand, but the fact that she was so quick to join up with them in the end was just a little out there for me, and not at all true to the character that was sketched out for her in the beginning. Still, that's a relatively minor gripe. ""National Treasure"" is a fun adventure for the whole family, and I'm looking forward to the highly-anticipated sequel that will be released later this year.",1186876800,5,1602,4.7214285714285715
1525384,4,B00005JN5E,"Walt Disney Pictures has sure hit a streak of massive live-action box office triumphs of late. Usually Disney does well with their animated films, but for the most part their live-action movies just don't quite add up to the same box office success. However, in recent years Disney's managed to change their luck, sure there've been a couple of flops here and there (""The Shaggy Dog"" remake), but those have been massively overshadowed by their successful releases, such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and the sequels that followed, ""Remember the Titans"", and ""Hidalgo"". One movie of Disney's that actually surprised both audiences by how good it was, and critics with how well it did at the box office, would have to be the Nicolas Cage, 'Indiana Jones' inspired, action/adventure film ""National Treasure"".

""National Treasure"" is about a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) who along with his partner Riley (Justin Bartha) are seeking this lost treasure of the Knights Templar that Ben's grandfather had told him about. It turns out the Gates family has been trying to find this secret treasure for years and have never succeeded, but Ben is getting closer. With clues hidden in numerous places, Ben and Riley are inching closer and closer to finding the treasure. However, Ben isn't like most treasure hunters, his only goal is to find the treasure and divide it amongst various museums so that all the world can see. But they aren't the only ones who know of the treasure, a rogue treasure hunter (Sean Bean), who used to work with Ben until he betrayed him, is searching for the treasure as well, and his motives are not nearly as pure. As both close in on the final clues, each man comes to the realization that the biggest clue lies in Washington D.C. on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Now, Ben will attempt to steal the Declaration of Independence for two reasons, one is that he hopes he can find the answers to solve the clues that has consumed his family for generations, and secondly, to protect the document from reaching his competitor's hands, who will use the treasure for his own selfish gains.

""National Treasure"" is actually one of those movies that looks good from the trailers, but also leaves you wondering if it's just a knock-off of some previous hit movie ('Indiana Jones' trilogy, in this case). But surprisingly, even though there are elements that are similar to Steven Spielberg's classic trilogy, this film does deliver to audiences a truly engaging and entertaining escape that feels both fresh and new. Director Jon Turtletaub (""Phenomenon"") and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer ('Pirates of the Caribbean' movies) have taken what was most likely a run-of-the-mill action/adventure and spiced it up to become better than it actually was destined to be. Truth be told, the basic story is fairly formulaic and easy to predict, but the solid performances, fun action sequences, and even some really funny bits of comedy give the movie a much more polished feel. The story actually did have some interesting bits of trivia about our nation's history sprinkled throughout as part of the clues, which I felt was a neat touch, and just the way each of the clues linked up was very well thought out, which also assisted in elevating the basic plot from your average action movie.

The actors all do very well with their roles Nicolas Cage gives a more low-key performance that doesn't appear to include his usual quirkiness that he's so well known for. Sean Bean is right on in the role of the rogue treasure hunter, villains are roles that Bean plays very well, and he always manages to entertain. Justin Bartha provides the bits of comedy that were used to break up the adventurous overtones, without them feeling out of place or forced. Cameo appearances by Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, and Harvey Keitel are all entertaining and fun to see, although I guess Voight's role is a little more than a cameo but he's only in the latter half of the film.

""National Treasure"" is a solid, action/adventure film that has a little something for everyone, and can be enjoyed by the whole family, and as a little bonus you may even learn some bits of trivia that you never even knew about our country.

""National Treasure"" is rated PG for violence.",1185494400,4,4336,4.861975642760487

1525387,1,B00005JN5E,"""National Treasure"" is a horrible movie.  I knew within the first 60 seconds of watching that it was hokey and cliche, but I was willing to sit through it if it was at least entertaining.  It wasn't.  The one redeeming quality the movie could have had was the clues to the treasure.  Give the audience something to guess at.  But the clues turned out to be so obscure and hidden in meaning that they might as well been written in a foreign language.

There are alot of good reviews for this movie for some reason.  But when you watch ""National Treasure"", as I know you will, remember my words.  You will at first feel disgusted by the awful acting, then betrayed by the cliche action scenes that you have seen a hundred times before.  A strange sensation will creep through your body, like you are slowly dying.  But don't worry, this is only extreme boredom.  You'll hope that the movie will redeem itself and begin to be entertaining, but it won't.

1525388,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is one of the premier movies ever.  Beautifully produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer Films, Junction Entertainment, and Saturn Films this movie, which was released on November 19, 2004, brought in 338 million dollars in the worldwide box office.  The movie was rated PG because of action violence and some scary images.  Filming for the movie was spectacularly completed on location at many of the historical sites where the story took place, the acting was superb, and the running time of 131 minutes provides plenty of entertainment.  Why not watch it today?

  When Benjamin Franklin Gates was young his grandfather told him a story that would change his life.  Intently Ben listened as his Grandfather told him of a massive, ancient mysterious treasure, which had been fought over for centuries.  The treasure had vanished.  Feeling that because the treasure was too valuable, it was too great for one man to have, a group called the Freemasons hid the treasure leaving behind a series of clues to its location.  In 1832 the last remaining signer of the Declaration of Independence was about to die, and with him the last clue would die, but just before he died he told the clue to his stable boy Tom Gates.  The clue that said, ""The secret lies with Charlotte,"" was passed down from generation to generation in the Gates family and each had spent years of their lives searching for the treasure without success until, finally Ben began searching.  The treasure was like a needle in a haystack but Ben devoted his life to finding it.

 Quickly Ben found a ship, which was named Charlotte, trapped north of the Arctic Circle.  Although the treasure was not aboard the ship Ben easily discovered the next clue.  After he understood the clue Ben realized that his treasure hunting was over because the map he would need was hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence in invisible ink.  Knowing that it was not possible to get his hands on the Declaration, Ben was ready to give up.  His colleague did not agree.  Ian Howe who had come along to help Ben decided that he would steal the Declaration, but when Ben would not go through with it he trapped Ben and his friend Riley Poole in the ship which was full of burning gunpowder.  After Ben and Riley survived the exploding ship they went to the government to warn them that the Declaration was going to be stolen, but they were assured that the priceless document was safe.

 When Ben was unable to convince the government that the Declaration was in danger he realized that the only way to keep the document safe was to steal it himself.  He knew it was wrong.  He knew it was impossible.  He knew it was insane.  Stealing the Declaration was not going to be easy so Ben and Riley carefully planned out each step as they prepared for their impossible mission.  Unlike Ben, who was planning a stealth mission to steal the document, Ian and his disreputable friends were planning to use force to reach the Declaration.  Quickly Ben made his way to the Declaration of Independence but because of Ian's seemingly endless resources he was right behind him.  Who would claim the treasure and who would be left behind?  One thing is sure, reaching the Declaration was only the beginning of Ben's dangerous journey to the treasure.

  Acting in National Treasure is brilliantly done by many great actors including Nicholas Cage who played the part of Ben.  The director of the extraordinary film was Jon Turtletaub.  National Treasure is a must see movie that will be enjoyed again and again.",1179619200,4,3582,4.758116883116883

It really disturbed me how in order for the characters to get closer to the treasure's location, priceless pieces of history (like 200 yr old gravestones & a boat) were permanently damaged or destroyed. Aren't the boat & gravestones of priceless value too? And come on- you're gonna roll the Declaration of Independence up like a poster and not have it start to fall apart? This is so fake, unbelievable.

If these characters are supposed to be all about discovering & preserving US history for everyone, then why show them as having such utter disrespect for these relics staying intact? Why weren't the characters written to have read up on antiques preservation, like a museum curator or art preservationist? That would have made more sense to me. All the characters seemed like irresponsible boneheads (like Jerry Springer guests), including Nicolas Cage's character. The character Reilly was EXTREMELY whiney, annoying & unnecessary to the story- I don't understand why they even used him at all or what his purpose to the story was.

I would have preferred intellectually intelligent characters in a race to stop the ""bad guy"" from destroying these relics- keeping the story about their intellectual challenge to solve the mystery instead of this Indiana Jones type plot (which takes away from the context of their plight, in my opinion).",1171238400,,1549,5.04296875

The plot made you think about our Country's history and since my husband is a Mason he had an instant connection with this movie.  We spent hours watching this movie (needless to say we've seen it SEVERAL times)then researched the information we gleened. Then we took the information and looked on the internet for more History Facts.  MUCH of it was accurate even though the story itself was fiction.  The details were fantastic right down to the time on the back of the one-hundred dollar bill.  The music was AWESOME and as we are both addicted to good music, this one is right up on the top of our list of movies with great music.

Take time to watch this movie and then start learning HISTORY again.  Look up Silence Dogood, Benjamin Franklin, Ottendorf Cyphers, Pass and Stow.  The list is endless for the knowledge you can learn.  I'm 57 years old and this was like a big TREASURE HUNT for me too.  ENJOY !",1167782400,2,1006,4.418478260869565

This is definitely geared to younger audiences.  The almost laughable plot holes are patched over with scene changes and 5 second dialogue patches.  I really only watched this because the filming in Philadelphia was directly across from where I worked.  (I didn't make it into any background scenes... oh well).  It's not that bad... but with a grown-up cast, I had the expectation for grown-up dialogue. (would have been nice.)  It's fast paced (to the point of sacrificing plausability)  Bad guys are bad for no real reason, and of course can't hit the broadside of a barn when firing their guns.

1525551,4,B00005JN5E,"If you can imagine a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type story taking place in modern America, you'd have a fairly good idea of what ""National Treasure"" is like. Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type treasure hunter, Benjamin Franklin Gates, accompanied by his partner (Justin Bartha) and romantic interest (Diane Kruger), the latter a historical document scholar who gets dragged into the wild proceedings.

THE PLOT: Gates feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis (Sean Bean). The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Gates successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously ""get the babe"" as well?

""National Treasure"" put a big grin on my face throughout its entire 2-hour run time. Like 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Nevertheless, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad by-product, no?

A handful of miscellaneous items:

Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in 2004's ""Troy,"" is super sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.

The score is modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.

The protagonists are all likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.

The chases are thrilling.

The film was shot on location in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.

Jon Voight plays Gate's father.

Like ""Raiders"" this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.

CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- ""National Treasure"" was a huge hit with audiences in 2004. This proves that critics like Roeper see WAY too many movies. They can't even lighten-up enough to enjoy a fun, thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick. Implausible? Yes (at times, anyway). Bad? No.

Make no mistake, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining quasi-believable adventure film. It's got the mojo.

The movie runs 131 minutes.

Nicholas Cage is from a long line of Treasure Hunters, and not just ANY treasure-But our Nation's Treasure which has built and built for centuries (aka. the Knights Templar Treasure) It is the biggest treasure known to man.

The movie explains a lot of history, that many of our Presidents were free masons, (OR guardians of this treasure) and that it is too big and powerful for one man to own, therefore, it has been added to, moved, fought over, and guarded for centuries.

When the movie opens we see Nicholas Cage taking the oath from his Grandfather as a guardian (knight)of this treasure as a child, then we see him (as an adult) and his men aboard a ship retreiving a clue.

One of the men betray him and make off with an important clue (That there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independance) and leaving Cage and his friend there for dead, they take off to steal the Declaration of Independance.

Cage, realizing he will destroy the Declaration once he gains the information from it, must race against time to steal it himself. We uncover clue after clue with the bad guys always just steps behind them, and it really is edge of your seat entertainment!",1163548800,3,1269,4.456896551724138

The swearing is at a low (less than ten times in the whole movie, I think is what I counted) and there is absolutely NO inappropriate jokes, clothing, or ANYTHING.  This is definitely a breath of fresh air!  Almost every movie is being polluted lately, and for my Christian family this movie is so welcomed.

The story line is ingenious.  Far fetched, sure, but so is Pirates and everyone loves that.  (I am in no way comparing the two movies, Pirates is completely different, but they do both have storylines based on something real that has been exaggerated)  It is pretty historically correct; Benjamin Franklin really DID write Silence Dogood letters, and the clock tower on the 100 dollar bill really DOES say 2:22!

Nicholas Cage does a fantastic job portraying Ben, and Riley is just hilarious.  No matter how many times I've seen this movie, he always cracks me up.

Jon Voight was rather good as Ben Gates's father.

I just wanted to say, in response to reviews that seem to me either unconscionably stuffy about the movie's historical innacuracy on the one hand, or a little too enthusiastic about it as a teaching tool on the other, I have a tip for you.  This is a movie.  Do not expect historical accuracy from a movie.

I'm in agreement with a lot of people, however, that although it's preposterous, the movie is irresistable.  It is fast and fun, well cast (except for Kruger, a dreadful actress), skillfully shot, soaked in atmosphere, scripted to articulate ideas we can all agree with, and wears so well, I watch it every time it comes on cable, though at first when my husband caught me at it I pretended I hadn't seen it before, until I found out he was doing the same thing.

1525638,4,B00005JN5E,"200 years ago, the Gates family came into a secret about a vast treasure -- knowledge of a legend that has been boon and bane. The secret concerns incalculable riches that have been passed down from ancient times and were hidden by the nation's founders, whose Masonic identities linked them to the hoard. Nicolas Cage, as Ben Franklin Gates, is the latest heir of the secret. He must outwit and outlast greedy rivals, a dubious federal government and a father hoping to bury the family's embarrassment.

""National Treasure"" is fast-paced and exciting, with Nicolas Cage constantly outwitting his enemies and unraveling clues. Cage's sidekicks are terrific too. Abigail Chase is smart, funny and vulnerable as Diana Kruger -- archivist at the National Archives -- and Cage's love interest. Justin Bartha -- as computer whiz Justin Poole -- is nebbishy and funny, and makes even Cage's history-geeky character look manly by comparison. John Voigt capably plays Cage's embittered father while Sean Bean plays yet another capable villain intent on grabbing the treasure for himself.

The movie includes more comedy than I expected, but is never too taxing on the brain. It moves too fast to let the viewer think about the plausibility that the nation's founders incorporated a treasure map into the country most sacred documents. The idea that two separate groups plan break-ins on the same night into the National Archives ought to leave one's head spinning. But in the end, you are caught in the movie's web, wondering how these delightful characters will manage to pull off their feats of derring-do and decipherment, all on the way to locating a treasure whose extent and identity no one is quite sure of.

The DVD extras are OK. There's an alternate ending that I thought was better but my son didn't. There's a short ""making of"" segment that gives away just enough of the film's secrets to be interesting and a cartoonish working video to help the movie makers set the stage for filming.",1151884800,5,1990,4.96996996996997

The result is that Gates has to run from the FBI as well as the bad guys in a race to solve the clues and find the treasure.

It surprised me how much I liked this movie. It is very fast-paced and suspense-filled, which typical of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.

1525643,3,B00005JN5E,"""National Treasure"" is a suspenseful and entertaining movie journey.  We follow the treasure hunt crusade of an adventurer, Gates (Nicolas Cage) who goes from the arctic to the nation's capital and its surrounding places.  He receives clues until he and his acquired sidekick (Diane Krieger) capture the ""Declaration of Independence"" from its vault and head place to place, obtaining further clues (like a child's treasure hunt) and seek buried treasure.

The plot is preposterous, and the journey is worth more than the destination, but ""National Treasure"" has been unfairly maligned.  The characters are likable, the adventure often is tense, and the humor is substantial enough to enjoy.  Yes, the movie's low-point is when they are squeezing lemon juice on one of our nation's most revered documents, but it provides a mixed blessing:  We should all be rolling our eyes, but we find ourselves biting our nails at the same time.  The picture would be a disaster if they didn't provide suspense and the ability to suspend the viewer's disbelief to a reasonable degree.

The movie is a well-paced old-school adventure, and out of all the Da Vinci Code rip-off desserts that audiences are being served, this one sits most comfortably on the stomach.

Now remember, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, so there's bound to be explosions... even in the middle of a frozen arctic sea. It wasn't obnoxious like many of his other pictures, though. Nicholas Cage was solid, and the Evil Treasure Hunters that he must spar with are a forgettable motley crew, which is my chief complaint: characterization.

This tale revolves around hidden Templar, Freemason, Founding Father loot hidden away somewhere in the good ol' US of A.  The characters are on a quest to decipher clues in our money, on old ships, in the National Archives to determine just where all this loot, if it does exist, was hidden.  The supporting cast doe an excellent job, Justin Bartha, as Gates sidekick Riley Poole is, unlike most adventure sidekicks, actually quite clever.  Diane Kruger as the government bureaucrat caught up in this mystery, Abigail Chase, is captivating.  The film also features Sean Bean as the bad guy, a role he seems to be placed in far too often in my opinion, Jon Voight as Gate's father, Christopher Plummer as the grandfather, and Harvey Keitel as the FBI agent.  This film has lots of action, good on location back drops and great visuals.  I must say, I like it better than all the Indiana Jones tales put together.  A great family film, all can enjoy.

1525764,5,B00005JN5E,"Who says history is always boring?  Granted, the story of this National Treasure is pure fiction, but its roots are grounded in the history of American Independence, especially the Declaration of Independence and that wily old codger Ben Franklin.  As the story goes, a group of Crusaders found this vast treasure in the Holy Land and formed the Knights Templar in order to keep it secret and protected; that mission was taken up in turn by the Freemasons.  By the start of the Revolutionary War, Freemasons such as George Washington, Ben Franklin, and other Founding Fathers hid the treasure so that it could not possibly be discovered by the British.  They left behind a number of clues as to its existence and location, but these were all but lost - the last surviving Founding Father, unable to meet with and reveal the secret to President Andrew Jackson, passed the first clue along to a servant just before his death.  That servant's descendants have spent major portions of their lives looking for a treasure that no one else believes exists - and with no luck whatsoever.  Not, that is, until Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) came along and actually solved the first clue.  I guess it' all downhill from here, right?  Well, not exactly.

The Declaration of Independence is probably the most heavily-protected document in the entire world - this thing, if I remember correctly, will actually survive a nuclear bomb if it is lowered down into its vault in time.  You can't just walk in and ask the nice National Archives folks to please open the case up and let you apply a reagent to it in order to reveal some sort of treasure map on its back.  (Gates tries it - it doesn't work.  No one will even believe his warning about his newly-acquired archenemy's plans for stealing it.)  In order to keep the document out of the wrong hands, he decides he has little choice but to steal it himself.  That's when things really start moving along - and they don't stop there, as each discovery leads to new clues about the treasure.  Continuing the quest is hard work, especially when every cop in the country is after you and your enemies want to know what you know and then kill you.

Personally, I would have liked more clues scattered along the way.  Gates figures out about the map on the back of the Declaration pretty darned quickly, and the remaining clues (which really are quite ingenious) sometimes get lost in the shuffle of Gates and his partners trying to avoid capture by the feds or their treasure-hunting competitors.  I was a little concerned about the way this movie might end - would they find the treasure or not?  It was potentially a lose-lose situation either way, but I have to say National Treasure delivers an ending I can easily live with.

I don't, as a general rule, like Nicolas Cage very much, but I have to say he seemed to fit himself to the character perfectly and injected plenty of energy into the entire movie.  The whole cast was very good.  Sean Bean was easy to dislike as Gates' ruthless rival in the search, Harvey Keitel was - well, he was Harvey Keitel, Justin Bartha was pretty funny as Gates' comic sidekick, and Diane Kruger was certainly an attractive addition as the curator turned ally (even though her loyalties seem to shift rather quickly).

I thought this was an immensely enjoyable film - a little less than perfect in a couple of places, but well-thought-out and actually pretty believable.  It's a wonder no one thought of this sort of story already.  After all, there is plenty of Mason-related speculation about the very design of Washington, D.C.  When you get right down to it, there's just nothing like a good conspiracy story.

The problem is that everyone is a critic and it seems that some people are rarely ever happy.  It's not LOTR, but it's still a good movie.  Cage is good, Kruger is as cute as ever, Sean Bean is... well, Sean Bean.  Love his on screen presence.  Jon Voight's character cracked me up, and who cannot enjoy Harvey Keitel in anything?

The whole conspiracy and idea of the treasure is entertaining and it's a real Indiana Jones type of a flick.  It's what Sahara should have been.  I'm a churchgoing Catholic, and as anti Catholic as the Masons are supposed to be, I don't consider this an anti Christian film.  That's silly.  The Masons are a great plot device.  It seems that many people have it in for the Masons. (including Rome)  Oh well.  Better a Mason than a Jihadist I always say!  ;-)

1525802,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a movie based upon the Freemason teachings and a mythological treasure hidden somewhere within the United States. It follows the story of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), who is a sixth generation treasure hunter, and remarkably, the only one who has ever come close to figuring out the only clue given to his great-great-great-great grandfather by the last surviving member of the original group that hid the treasure.

The story is full of action from the practically beginning, where Gates solves the clue that had been plaguing his family since the 1840s. The clue, the secret lies with Charlotte, was finally solved by Gates and started a series of events that solves the mystery.

The only thing is that all of the Gates family prior to Ben had to be complete idiots, as the clues the founding fathers had left, were remarkably simple, and could have been solved by anyone with a general understanding of American History. If you can look past the simplicity of the clues, you can see that the movie has a lot of high points and there's a lot of things that could be overlooked if you didn't watch it more than once.

In this movie, starring Nicolas Cage, The Declarating of Independence apprently has and invisible map that the founding fathers put that apparently leads to a major treasure. Then two different teams try to steal the historic document. That's just the beggining to the hogwash that this movie spews.  Every single scene is obsurd. There are many ways to look at this film, but a reasonable, smart adult simply could not come to another conclusion on the central point of its obsurdity.

Is the film fun? Occasionally. There are a couple decnet, not great, chase sequences, and the film's ending has its admirable qualities. Still when Harvey Keitel is wasted as a detective figure, and when coincidences so rediculous are necessary, and when predictabilities and cliches of adventure movies are apparent, than you just don't have a good film.

There are movies that are both rapidly silly and good; take the likes of Monty Python and some of the quirkier projects the Coen Brothers have done for example. Nation Treasure does not belong in that catagory because beyond the silliness there's very little substance. It only exsists to be rediculous, and perhapse make the viewer smile a few times here and there.",1138406400,2,1290,4.9906976744186045

My only gripe is that it seemed to all be tied up a little too tidily for my tastes at the end. I also could care less for the love story they stapled into it. Puke!

I enjoyed virtually everything about it - the history, the American pride, the on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement, the humor...in fact, I feel that the reason why the critics despised it so much was for all the reasons why I liked it, especially the pride in our county's history. I can watch this movie over and over and still catch things I missed the previous times. No, there is nothing in this movie that is controversial (another reason why the critics didn't like it...it didn't upset the mainstream). It's a movie for the entire family. In fact, my 14 year old son began his own dissention into American History right after watching National Treasure, taking it upon himself to study the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution (he found out that our country is veering way off course from our forefathers original intentions, thanks mainly to the traditional American value haters, the ACLU).
If I had one complaint of this movie is the last 15 minutes could have been a bit longer, playing out the capture rather than a quick telling.

One of the previous reviews mentions that George Washington and Ben Franklin were Masons.  However, so were Sam Adams and Paul Revere.  In fact, it is said that the Boston Tea Party was preceded by a meeting of members of the Boston Lodge and many of the ""indians"" who threw the tea over the side were members of that lodge.  The Masons definitely had a major part in bringing the American Revolution to fruition and victory.

As a third generation member of a Masonic family and a former U. S. History teacher, I love this film and have watched it as many times as I can, constantly finding new things about it.  The historic facts are on target as are the Masonic allusions.  (Don't get excited those of you looking for Masonic secrets; anything shown can be found in your local library)  These are interwoven with a bit of imagination into the plot to protect the Templar treasure, supposedly gathered over the centuries from lost civilizations.  How breathtaking to be able to read, once again, the scrolls from the library at Alexandra or to see centuries old pieces of art, which supposedly had been destroyed.  The treasure is sent to the New World to protect it from those in the Old World who would steal it from the peoples of the World.  And, where better to hide it but in one of the oldest, most revered churches in the United States, a place where George Washington actually worshipped - my, my.  Add to that the eye candy for male or female viewers of Diane Kruger, Sean Bean and Nicholas Cage along Jon Voight, who has become an elder statesmen of the acting profession, and Harvey Keitel giving his usual wry performance as the FBI agent in pursuit, not of the treasure, but of those who would dare steal the Declaration of Independence.

An exciting story wrapped around real history with marvelous performances.  I'm not sure what the ""official"" critics wanted.  Perhaps they should come down from their ivory towers and watch this movie with ordinary people who are only looking for great entertainment.

All of the elements are there: The slightly obsessive lover of history, the beautiful girl who takes herself more seriously than he takes himself and the disapproving father who has an adventurous past of his own. The villains never rise above the level of greedy fortune-hunters (as opposed to the ""it belongs in a museum!"" motivation that is as close to altruistic as this breed of hero gets), which is one of the flaws in the film, but everyone executes their roles well, including a very grounded Harvey Keitel as a down-to-earth FBI agent pursuing Nicholas Cage and company as they scamper up and down the east coast.

Nicolas Cage discovers that there is a treasure map hidden on the Declaration of Independence...so he steals it. He is chased by his former employer who would have stole the Declaration if Nicolas didn't first, and the FBI is after everyone for their troubles.

One clue leads to another revealing more about the Free Masons, the various historic members, and their contributions to the concealment of this hidden treasure.

  This is not a documentry, it is not a Drama, it isn't TRYING to take itself too seriously and it isn't based on any true story, although there is a fabled ""lost treasure"" of the Knight's Templar.

  What this movie is trying to provide is a fun, interesting story with fun, likeable people in it. Even the ""bad guy"" is likeable to a certain extent.

  Entertainment is all this story is trying to offer, so I find it saddening that so many people feel so compelled to trash the details so much. When you saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" did you think you were seeing real history?

His grandfather has taught him that they are keepers of a great secret - the first clue to the location of a great treasure, collected by Templars, Masons, and Illuminati over the centuries.  Originally hidden in Europe, it was transferred to our continent even as we started the wobbly road to becoming a nation and hidden carefully behind a maze of clues.  Gates is a man possessed.  With his assistant Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and the help of master thief Ian Howe (Sean Bean), he solves the first clue.  The map to the treasure is hidden on the back of a well-known document - The Declaration of Independence.

Abandoned by Howe, Gates and Riley make their way back to civilization.  After several efforts to alert authorities, the pair realized that the only was to save the Declaration of Independence from being stolen was to steal it themselves.  So the first part of the film is an outrageous theft counter theft story in which not one, but two groups of thieves attempt the impossible.  Gates succeeds by the skin of his teeth and, in the process, drafts Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), the Declaration's keeper as a not quite willing accomplice.

What follows is a combination a high-speed chase and a history lesson as Howe pursues Gates and the FBI pursues everyone.  The film overplays its hand a bit, but manages to stay on the light story of this story of thieves and ladders.  While the story is predictable, it has all the mysteries and cliffhangers you might want.  And you have the bonus of visits to the other side of several famous monuments to the founding of the United States.  The history lessons alone are worth the price of admission.

The humorous dialog, lack of violence and bloodshed, and exciting action make this the perfect vehicle for displaying some interesting facts about our forefathers.  Perfect for anyone who isn't terrified of the influence of the Illuminati.",1130544000,6,2476,4.819905213270142

Not because of the plot but because I only recognized one actor (Nicholas Cage) and he has a distrusting track record with me.  So I finally found a few minutes to rent the movie/ or rather I thought I'd be able to multitask while it was on.  Nope.  I was hooked from the minute I pressed play.  National Treasure is an action pack thrill ride with a splash of comedy thrown into the mix.  The only negative I had was the canned ending.  I sort of wanted them to stick to the Raiders of the Lost Ark's blueprint.

Still--I highly recommed the movie.",1130198400,4,610,4.198275862068965
1525931,5,B00005JN5E,"NATIONAL TREASURE is very much in the same vein as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, ROMANCING THE STONE, THE DAVINCI CODE etc.  The Knights Templars treasure has been hidden and guarded by the Freemasons, by a twist of fate one of their members was not able to pass along his piece of the puzzle as planned before his death and the clue fell to an outsider.  The outsiders family has passed the story down until the present day heir, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage) takes up the quest.  In pursuit of the treasure Gates collects some allies as he races a villan along the East coast following clues left by the Founding Fathers.

This is a great movie to watch on a lazy weekend afternoon.  It is a PG (for action violence and scary images) so can be shared with all but the youngest children and yet is sophisticated enough to entertain adults.  While it is definitely a 'fun movie' rather than a 'serious film' (which could explain why the critics hated it) it could possibly spark a discussion or two.

Overall this is a DVD that is worth renting or better yet buying.  The film is engaging enough to be watched more than once and the extras, while aimed at the middle school crowd, are well done and an enjoyable way to spend an evening.

On a more serious note, I was pleased by the the performance of Diane Kruger (who disappointed me as Helen in ""Troy"") and even more so by the quirky and eternally memorable performance of Justin Bartha as Riley Poole.

1525983,3,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a decent, escapist film, but anyone could have played the part of treasure hunter Ben Gates.  Nicholas Cage's true talents are wasted here.  Don't get me wrong; he does play ""kooky researcher"" well: it's just that it was a no-brainer for him, and something an unknown actor could have done to get some exposure.

There is more famous male talent, with John Voigt playing Ben's father, and Sean Bean as Ben's treasure hunter rival Ian Howe.  (No, that is not Rutger Hauer, that is Sean Bean).

Blond bimbo Diane Kruger plays nerdy archivist Abigail Chase, who happens to look like she walked out of a modeling agency.  As much time as she spends in museum basments, obsessing over dusty archives, that must also make you spend hours getting ready in the morning.  Of course Ben and she fall in . . . oh, barf, it's so predictable.

The movie is a fun sort of American History scavenger hunt through Philadelphia, where our heroes look for clues left by Ben Franklin to find the supposed treasure collected by the Knights Templar and managed by the Stonemasons.  Watching the movie, you feel as if you are being tricked into watching an educational film, as Ben spouts historical trivia while running from Howe.

Justin Bartha is a good actor, but his role as basically eunuch sidekick to Cage is embarrassing to watch.  Bartha basically is the third wheel, ignored as Ben and Abigail make eyes at each other.

I just don't think I would watch it over and over as much as the Indie movies.  There wasn't as much going on besides the main plot of Nicholas' character.

Jon Voight is grumpy and fun as the father. Kruger is very good as the love interest. The plot has a lot of twists and turns that keeps the movie exciting. They run around historical sites in New England, which keeps the movie interesting as well. The love story between Cage and Kruger works because they have a common reverence for history and they work well together. The clues are obtuse, but they make sense in an esoteric sort of way. Justin Bartha, Cage's sidekick, keeps making fun the clue-solving process, which keeps the audience involved. The bad guys are bad, but they are intelligent. The enemies respect each other so that adds to the charm of the movie as well.

The movie was recommended to me by a high school history teacher, and he did not lead me wrong. This movie respects our founding fathers and the truths they sacrificed for. I enjoyed the movie immensely.",1128297600,3,1019,4.478494623655914

First of all, this is one of those ""safe"" action-packed flicks, meaning my husband can have his fast-action/fighting needs met, and I don't get grossed out by blood, guts, and violence.  The movie is fast paced, exciting, and (despite criticisms) mildly intellectually challenging.

Also, the characters are very likable.  Yes, the roles are predictable from a mile off.  But there were distict ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", with a little bit of romance to keep me hoping but prevents my husband from calling it a chick-flick.

I did enjoy it but I won't be buying it; it's nothing to watch more than once or twice if you're over the age of 14.

I do HIGHLY recommend it for kids, since it's a good exciting romp through American history places and characters of note. For the kids and the history I'll give it that extra star, but for an adults movie it's definitely too simplistic.",1127520000,4,691,4.18796992481203
1526011,3,B00005JN5E,"Okay, maybe it's not that simplistic, but pretty close.

Take an idea from The Da Vinci Code (clues hidden on famous artifacts). Add a theory that those clues lead to a treasure hidden for centuries and protected by a secret order (a la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). Add a sunken ship in the Antarctic (a la Titanic), with a smoking pipe still on board whose stem has raised figures which, when inked up, can print 6 lines of verse that point to the Declaration of Independence as a possible source of clues. Add a scheme to steal that document (a la Mission Impossible). Add people thinking you're crazy because you're the only one who believes in your theory (a la Conspiracy Theory). Add a code written on the back of the Declaration of Independence that corresponds to the individual letters in letters written by Benjamin Franklin (a la A Beautiful Mind). Add magic glasses found in Independence Hall that allow the wearer to see images on the back of the Declaration...and on it goes. Improbability stacked upon improbability, and all borrowed from other films.

Now add a middle age Nicolas Cage who's being asked to play an action hero. It boggles the mind.

I really wanted to like this film. I was expecting high adventure along the lines of Indiana Jones meets Sherlock Holmes, as I think a lot of people were. But the producers seem more interested in being the first to bring a Da Vinci Code type film to the screen than in producing a top-notch piece of entertainment. This is filmmaking reduced down to comic book standards. It is filmmaking by the numbers.

These filmmakers, and Hollywood in general, are not interested in giving us something that resembles reality, or is even believable. They think we are totally gullible, don't care, or will not even notice when things don't make sense. They think all we want is bigger, louder, flashier, sexier, more violent, more everything. But what we really want is a good story well told. This is not a good story; but it is entertainment! Is that bad? When they could have given us both, yes.

1526012,4,B00005JN5E,"'National Treasure' became an instant favorite movie for me. I agree with others in saying that this film is so awesome! The thrills, mysteries and suspense are really significant and of course, you could add the joy ride of chasing and action packed scenes which adds luster to the movie. I was so amazed by the fact of its touch of history blending with the fictional presentation or style of story telling. It was actually blended with vital history highlights.

Nicolas Cage character as Benjamin Franklin Gates is cool and smart and he done a great job for portraying as what he call themselves (with Bartha) as 'treasure-protectors'. Justin Bartha as Riley Poole adds comic relief (sometimes foolish lines delivery) while Dianne Kruger as Dr. Chase gave a near-believable character as an Archive Director. What can I say about the production? Jerry Bruckheimer is the master of all good-production maker for films. I have never imagined an ancient-like or crypt underneath the city as the movie presented. A plus for its production value.

Sure, I was amazed by Nicholas Cage's amazing ability to decipher clues that have remained a mystery for hundreds of yers.  Could anyone have realistically done so?  No way.

If you were at all interested by the previews, or simply enjoy a treasure-hunting tale, or simply are a fan of American history (regardless, of whether the ""Da Vinci Code/Masons"" story is plausible), you will enjoy this movie.

1526071,2,B00005JN5E,"While I share the view that this movie is an unabashed attempt to trade in on the popularity of the Da Vinci Code and conspiracy theories about the Masons and the Knights Templar, that is not why I am giving it two stars.  In fact, I don't see why the fact that a movie simply rides on the wave of a popular trend is a reason not to like that movie.  Instead, it is the poor acting that bothered me the most.  Nicholas Cage is his typical self (which is to say, one of America's least talented actors), and Sean Bean mails it in even more so than he did in ""Troy.""

The other aspect of this movie that bother me is the fact that you can tell the writers were scribbling together an ending well after the movie started filming.  I think the haste to throw this movie together was not so much out of the need to ride the Da Vinci Code popularity wave, but rather to beat Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown to the punch.  Published reports indicate that his next story is about...you guessed it...the Masons, and it takes place in the United States.  It is not surprising that in the rush to get the movie out the door, the makers of National Treasure gave us a rather disjointed movie with some rather absurd plot twists and a phenomenally stupid ending (which I won't ruin here).

Still, the movie has its moments.  To avoid spoiling anything, all I will say is that the most clever twist in the movie is a tribute to the inventing talents of Benjamin Franklin.  The theft of the Declaration of Independence, while perhaps not as dramatic as the famous theft scene in Mission: Impossible, is exciting.

All told, this movie is worth the time if you're stuck on a flight, home sick on a rainy day, or are the utmost fans of far-fetched conspiracy theory stories.  Otherwise, wait for Dan Brown's take on the Masons (unless you hate Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code, in which case this whole genre is probably not for you).",1126224000,3,1915,4.348314606741573

  Let me start by saying ""National Treasure"" utterly did not live up to the hype that was lavished upon it in the pre-release media blitz. Simply put, it was a blatant all-out campaign to sell the public on the legitimacy of Freemasonry that has always had a shadowy past.

  Where did I watch this you ask? I happened to be 38,000feet in the air heading to Las Vegas looking forward to a great vacation. I did not expect to watch a poor theatrical performance where even the actors put aside their natural talents to peddle incessantly the dribble of masonry. So much for getting good entertainment value for the money!?

  What was there to like? Well, the Indiana Jones' action sequences were good plus the near misses to life and limb were interesting. I do like Nicholas Cage as an bonafide actor but even his talent couldn't save a film that left you feeling empty at the end with more questions than answers.

  Historically, there appears to be evidence of revisionist creative liberties and licenses taken on a monumental scale. The All-Seeing Eye on the $1 dollar bill didn't appear there until Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it there during his term of office as the president of the United States of America. It looks like these people came out of the closet and have come into the light of day only recently having prepared the American public for such a day. Unfortunately, I like my entertainment straight forward without alot of contrived nonsense and intentional programming meant to sway my objective sense of things.

  Would I recommend this movie to anybody. Well, it depends what you want out of it. Do you want to be lectured to propaganda style, or do you want to see a half-decent action flick that is readily available through any one of Arnold Schwarzeneggars' collection.

1526076,4,B00005JN5E,"NATIONAL TREASURE was not highly regarded by most movie critics. Understandably so, I suppose, if you consider that it has no particular artistic merit to recommend it. On the other hand, if you're like me, veracity, artistry and believability in movies play second fiddle to entertainment value. For real life drama, I'm more inclined to read a newspaper or check the news. I usually watch movies for fun and to be entertained. In that sense, NATIONAL TREASURE fills the bill.

Does that mean I think NATIONAL TREASURE is a great movie? No. Read the professional critic at the top of the column. He hits the nail right on the head. It's hokey and contrived; a ""comedy/caper"" of absurd proportions. Nor is there a classic acting performance comparable to the one given by Johnny Dep in PIRATES to recommend it (personally, I thought Geoffrey Rush was also terrific). The acting here is solid, but unspectacular.

Still, this movie is fast-paced fun with lots of engaging puzzles, some interesting high tech gadgetry, tunnels, skeletons and, of course, a treasure of ridiculous proportions. It's sort of an adult version of THE GOONIES. And, for those of you who appreciate beautiful women, Diane Kruger is lovely as Dr. Chase.

If you're looking for a serious drama, or something artistically redeeming, steer clear of NATIONAL TREASURE.

PLOT: Nicholas Cage plays the role of Benjamin Franklin Gates, who inherited the Gates family quest of searching for the legendary treasure of the Knights Templar. The Knights blended in with the Free Masons and brought the treasure to America before the Revolutionary War. Assisting him in the search is Riley, who, let's face it, was brought along as the ""Comical Wisecracking Brainiac Assistant."" However, he also carries his role well, adding well-placed comic relief. Along for the ride is Ian (Lord of the Rings' Sean Bean), treasure-hungry yet wealthy investor who shares Ben's mission to find the treasure - but not his appreciation for its historical significance. After refusing Ian's offer to help steal the Declaration of Independence, Ben and Riley escape Ian's death trap and must match their wits against Ian's skill and bluster. Ben realizes that the only way he can stop Ian from stealing the Declaration IS to steal it. He enlists the unknowing help of National Archives employee Abigail Chase, and through an ingenious sequence of events, pulls off a hi-tech theft of the nation's founding document...barely in advance of Ian's attempt. While avoiding the understandably-upset authorities, Ben, Riley and Abigail track down further clues in hopes of locating the treasure...before Ian does.

GOOD: Ben's a positive character, clearly standing for justice, truth, and the American way. (Music please) He doesn't want to steal the Declaration of Independence, but Ian's pending theft forces him to. He has an innate appreciation and awe for the document's significance, and for the history behind it. The movie does not have intentionally-inserted good-vs.-evil themes, but you know who the good guys are...and they ARE the good guys. The film is also very educational and historical. And naturally, the soundtrack is the icing on the cake...very reverent, rustic and antique.

BAD: Very little to watch out for on the part of young children. There's maybe one or two swear words, if that. They kept surprising me, every time I thought they would swear, they didn't. There are dark and scary moments to look out for; Riley comes face-to-face with a frozen and half-decayed corpse rather suddenly, making him panic. Later, an ancient casket is moved, but the bottom falls through, shattering the aged bones on the ground. Ian and his thugs use a taser on a guard, shoot at Ben, and threaten him, Riley, Abigail. He also threatens Ben's father, played by Jon Voight, who does not share Ben's enthusiasm for the hunt, feeling that it has wasted the lives of the Gates family. No sexual content, except where two characters of the opposite sex change clothes in separate rooms while talking to each other. (We see them putting underwear on, but we don't see anything explicit) When Ben shows up at his father's house with Abigail in tow, his father immediately assumes she is pregnant.

THOUGHTS: This is just a really good movie. What else can I say? It has all the essential ingredients needed: action, suspense, intrigue, puzzles, treasure hunts, and a little romance thrown in. It's richly woven with story, history, and intricately-woven detail. Treasure hunts aren't anything new, but the ingenuity, the skill with which the plot is crafted is amazing to watch unfold. The fact that it's ""local"" - taking place (and filmed on location) in Washington DC, about a treasure hidden by America's founding fathers - makes it all the more endearing. Nine and a half out of ten stars. (I'd give it ten, but SOMETHING has to separate it from Lord of the Rings!)

BONUS MATERIALS: Sorely lacking, and it's rather irritating that you have to go through a big treasure hunt charade on the DVD before unlocking more materials...only to find that they really weren't worth the time. I have no doubt that you could find the code on a website somewhere and save yourself some time, but I really haven't checked.",1124668800,8,4095,5.042836041358936

1526125,4,B00005JN5E,"Inspired by stories about the Knights Templar and the Masons, a fanciful tale about a long-lost treasure spanning centuries of history was created for the 2004 film ""National Treasure"".  Directed by Jon Turteltaub (who directed ""Phenomenon"" in 1996), the film suggests that the original Declaration of Independence contains a hidden map to the mythical treasure that was allegedly hidden by various Founding Fathers (including Benjamin Franklin) to prevent it from falling into British hands during the Revolutionary War.  Knowledge of the mythical treasure had been passed down through several generations of the Gates family until it reached the ears of Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) when he was a boy.  Ben spends most of his adult life searching for the only key to the treasure that he knows about: something called Charlotte.  With help from the unscrupulous Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Ben finds the Charlotte and discovers another key to the treasure that leads him (and Ian) to the Declaration of Independence, which is under the watchful care of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger).  Hoping to beat Ian to the Declaration, Ben is assisted by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) to try and steal it from the National Archives in Washington, D.C., in order to save it from Ian, who would not be inclined to not harm the precious 200-year-old document.  With a lot of suspense and chasing, Ben and Riley succeed with the unintended help from Abigail.  The Declaration does indeed hold some hidden information, but instead of being a map, it holds another set of clues in finding the treasure that include a set of old letters that Ben's father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), has in his possession.  Naturally, upon stealing the Declaration, the FBI gets involved and Ian is still determined to get the treasure before Ben can.  Will Ben be able to solve the mystery or will Ian or the FBI stand in his way?  You'll just have to watch this entertaining film to find out.

The legends about the Knights Templar once having a huge treasure, as well as mysteries surrounding the Free Masons, were a good premise for creating the plot for ""National Treasure"".  With a mix of suspense, good special effects and interesting characters, the film works sufficiently well to keep most of the audience engaged throughout its 131 minutes.  Hence, overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  The DVD also includes deleted scenes, cryptography games and background documentary information.  Other interesting characters include FBI agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and Ben's grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer).",1123891200,,2593,5.068235294117647

This fascinating adventure, starring Nicholas Cage, tells the story of a man, Benjamin Franklin Gates, out to fullfill his family's legacy.  As a boy, he discovers an ancient family secret.  Years before his time, or his father's time, or even his grandfather's time, his great, great grandfather, Thomas Gates was told of a treasure -- a treasure so great, so amazing, that had come from all over the world, growing larger and larger every time it was moved from country to country.  Suddenly the treasure disappeared for centuries, until it was found by knights on the crusade.  The knights took it with them and soon it was taken to America by the Free masons.  Many of the Founding Fathers were free masons, and together they hid the treasure, leaving clues from a Mereshon pipe to an invisible code on the back of the Declaration of Independence.

Along with his friend Riley and a recruited Dr. Abigail Chase, Benjamin must find the treasure before the dreaded Ian Howe steals it for his own benefit.

This fasinating story will keep you on the edge of your seat and deep in thought.  Although quite fictious, it is quite entertaining and puzzling to the mind of even a master US historian.

I highly recomend this to both anyone under the age of 18 and anyone over.",1123027200,3,1419,4.595238095238095
1526162,5,B00005JN5E,"This movie was an extremely fun jaunt through early American History.  Once you suspend disbelief that there is actually something on the back of the Declaration of Independence, you can really enjoy yourself.  Forget that everything is a chain of coincidences--that is what makes it so much fun, unraveling the clues.  However this isn't just some obscure mystery, this involves the very founding of our nation.

The scenes were well done, many filmed on location (though the interior of Independence Hall was filmed inside the full-scale replica in Southern California at Knott's Berry Farm), greatly enhanced the picture.  Furthermore I enjoyed the cast of characters, especially seeing Sean Bean as a villian.

There wasn't really anything in this movie that I would warn others about, I would definately show it to young kids (after explaining that they shouldn't steal the Declaration if they get a crazy idea ;-)).  Furthermore, they might actually absorb some real history (Benjamin Franklin was a brilliant inventor for example).

Of course the movie is out of theatres so the only access is VHS or DVD--and the DVD has great hidden features.  Though I'll admit that I cheated and looked up the codes on-line, :-).  You can find out a bit more about the Masons and about real-life treasure hunters.  It isn't all glamour and action.  Do make sure though that you watch the alternate ending.  The dialogue is nice and witty, it fits perfectly in with everything else.

Have you ever watched a movie so bad that it was funny?  This was anything but--however, it was so funny and enjoyable that it was easy to suspend disbelief and ignore any apparent small errors.",1122940800,6,1671,4.960431654676259

1526165,2,B00005JN5E,"This is a non-spoilers review of 'National Treasure.'

'National Treasure' has no profanity, little violence, totally avoids anything even remotely controversial, and is a safe movie choice for anyone with children aged 8-10. Unfortunately, family friendly does not automatically translate into a fun viewing experience. Simply put, 'National Treasure' isn't a very good film, and it's beyond me how people over-rate this big-budget B-movie.

No one can fault the actors for trying their best with this material, and no one can ever accuse Nicolas Cage or Jon Voight of turning in a bad performance. The problem lies in the increasingly far-fetched and condescending screenplay. We're given a senseless quest headed up by an blandly idealistic hero, who's aided by a chaste girlfriend, an unfunny 'comic relief' best friend, and a slightly world-weary father. Stock situations, stock characters, and a total lack of screenwriting inspiration.

I'm a big fan of escapist movies from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'The Phantom,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. All of those films could also be considered children's movies, but all of them respect their young audiences' attention and intelligence. 'National Treasure' doesn't. In fact, while watching 'National Treasure' I developed a new appreciation for the 'Harry Potter' movies, which give their audience enough credit to solve puzzles themselves rather than having the answers thrust upon them the moment the puzzle is presented. The extras are a lot more fun than the film itself.

I can understand why this film did such stellar business at the box office in the fall of 2004. I can equally understand why there are a plethora of unwanted 'previously' viewed copies for sale at your local video rental.",1122595200,2,1788,5.285211267605634

1526232,3,B00005JN5E,"The trailer for this film was intriguing, as who wouldn't want to see a film that teases us with a secret message written on the back of the Declaration of Independence and the hero's vow to steal our most famous document from the National Archives? With a premise like that, this film was a definite must see for anyone who loves a good adventure story or appreciates America's founding history, with it's rich symbolism and mysterious secrets connected to Freemasonry and the Knights Templar.

Of course, I saw this film months after I had read ""The Da Vinci Code"", so my appreciation for this film was lessened as I felt it was a blatant rip-off of that phenomenal novel. I suspect sinister Hollywood theft at hand in making this film, as it follows the same type of twists and turns as that novel, and it's no secret that writer Dan Brown is currently researching/writing his follow-up, which will do for our Founding Fathers and the U.S. Capitol what he did for Da Vinci and the Pyramid du Louvre. Consider this film a pre-emptive move by Hollywood, so they don't have to shell out the big bucks for film rights on Dan Brown's new novel whenever it finally gets published.

Make no mistake though, this film is highly entertaining as we follow the leads on a chase following strange clues that lead to the next clue. It has more twists than a ""Moonlighting"" episode. By the end, it doesn't amount to much and instantly forgettable by the time one made it home from the theater. The biggest unsatisfying factor of the film was its conformity to the cliched formula...as the lead actor gets the girl (who was little more than eye candy) and the sidekick is left alone. They even joke about that fact at the end of the film. Anyhow, yes, this movie made lots of money, defying film critics of their near universal animosity for this film. Whether you will like it or not depends on how much you enjoy being entertained versus how much you want to also learn a few things. This is popcorn escapism at its best. For those of us wanting more, it fails to deliver. Perhaps a more serious look at our nation's founding and the role of Freemasons will be made into a film one day, but this is not that film.",1122422400,2,2203,4.518796992481203

1526235,4,B00005JN5E,"Wow i never would think i would see an action movie with a history lesson and a free tour of america's historical places.

The Plot-Ben Gates(Nicholas Cage) has been told since his childhood by his grandfather that there is a treasure that is within our country that has the most valuable treasures across the world and that the only way to find it is to solve hidden riddles that are within national documents, places, and currency. Entailing one big wild giant riddle that leads Ben and his friends across the country. BUT Ben and Co. are not the only ones that are after this treasure, His ex-friends are willing to kill to get their greedy hands on this treasure.

This movie is one big treasure hunt that leads the viewer to national monuments, landmarks, and many cities. If you do not go out much don't worry because this movie is like a tour guide around the U.S.

The Action-This movie is not really a shoot-em-up, explosion type of action movie. Since this is a Disney movie(hard to believe)it has some gunshots fired but this movie is mostly a race to the treasure, so expect to see alot of running and watch Ben and Co and his foes play hot potato with the Declaration of Independence(since their is a treasure map on the back that leads to the treasure)

The negatives-Sometimes the movie can seem a little unreal since i think it is impossible to steal the Declaration O.I. and some of the action scenes like when Ben is hanging and swinging on a van's back door while the van is in motion while avoiding oncoming traffic. And the whole treasure hunt around the country does seem unreal, but hey thats why it's a movie right?

Conclusion-I urge you to atleast rent this movie because it's a tourguide on film, your kids will like the whole treasure hunt aspect, mostly good action scenes, and great acting(for the most part)and if you like it, then purchase or whatever you please.

When I watched this movie, it seemed like the actors were the Goonies all grown up: a treasure map, a quest, being followed by bad guys, having the treasure close at hand, realizing it's gone and finally finding it again in the end.

You've got the good guys: Nicholas Cage who plays the trusting and dedicated scientist Ben Gates; the soon-to-melt ice queen, Abigail Chase played by Diane Kruger; and their trusty side-kick, the Robin to Cage's Batman , Riley Poole, a computer hacker and goof ball extraordinaire, fabulously played by Justin Bartha.  And the bad guys: tough-talking Ian Howe, played by Sean Bean, who doesn't quite have the smarts of the good guy, and of course, Ian's blundering yet endearing henchmen.

There are parts that smack of Indiana Jones, as you get to meet Ben's father who gets taken along for the ride. But it doesn't quite have the glitter of the illustrious Harrison Ford series. But what it does have is a refreshing break from bloody violence and coarse language. No nudity either, as we have to watch Cage and Kruger undress through the dressing-room doors. I don't think we've missed anything there! And it does have some magnificent scenery and some very video game-like computer graphics (I foresee a very easy transition there!).

Had the makers adhered to more historical truth and only fleshed it out with fiction, this could have been an intellectually enjoyable film for adults. But as it stands it's still a great film for kids. It's the kind of film to get the imagination going, especially when you're 8-10 years old.

This is a great action film. Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and Ian Howe (Sean Bean) start out working together, searching for the clues to the treasure. Howe's greed comes to the front, and from that point, the chase is on. It moves well, and the lead changes hands in a number of well-scripted surprises.

It's a bit implausible in places. There were two different ""Mission Impossible"" attacks on security around the Declaration, for example, where even one would be improbable. The vast network of diggings under New York City, too, seemed improbable. Between building foundations, basements and sub-basements, subways, utilities, and everything else, the entire underground volume of NYC is better mapped than the surface of some places. The movie's caverns aren't the kind of thing that would have gone un-noticed for so long.

But hey, it's fiction. I'll allow this kind of movie three impossible things, and it came in on budget - or near. Exciting chases, low violence, and people keep their clothes on. It's not the most memorable film, but good entertainment.

When he finally solves this clue, it leads to another clue, and another and another, and so on.  The first clue points to the Declaraion of Independence.

Knowing that Ian, his ex-partner, plans to steal the Declaration --- and knowing that Ian has no real respect for that piece of history and only wants the treasure for himself --- Gates decides that he has to steal the Declaration of Independence himself in order to protect it.

With the help of his remaining partner, Riley, and the lovely Dr. Chase --- an expert on the Declaration and on the handling of antique documents --- Gates follows a twisting path laid down by the free masons, trying to put together the pieces of this massive puzzle.

Filled with adventure and lots of good clean humor, this movie is fun for all ages.  The plot is complex and intricate, the characters are likable, and the action increases in speed and intensity as Gates, Riley, and Chase try to find the end of this maze before Ian does.  Watch this one, it's quite exciting!",1121126400,2,1616,4.6223776223776225
1526319,2,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is one the cheesiest movies I've ever seen. Clues on the back of the Declaration of Independece? After seeing the trailer, I went to see thinking it couldn't be a bad movie. I was wrong. From the opening scene, when his friend turns on him, the movie starts to bore you. This movie is compilation of other good movies and books done twice as bad. The stealing of the Declaration of Independence reminded me of the stealing of the NOC list from Mission:Impossible, but twice as bad if not worse. (Take into consideration that M:I was made in '96. The security for this heavily guarded item is laughable and stupid. Some of the clues are difficult believe and people in DC with guns is very difficult to believe, especially with our countries security now. Most of the story is an awful rip off from Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code (which I loved). The parts starting with the lines ""Who wants to go down the dark tunnel first?"" or something of the sort kick and a rip off from Indiana Jones and once again are much worse. (That series was made way back when) You have been warned, National Treasure is an insult to Americas' intellingence. (Aww heck, Rush Hour was a more intellingent movie than this) Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to leave your brain somewhere else when you see this. (Perhaps you could hire a sitter for it.) I would have preffered that the movie ended when they didn't find the treasure.

1526320,4,B00005JN5E,"Well, this was a good family film and I think the PG rating showed that. On that note, this movie should not be taken for anything with a real film-style intrinsic value.

The story is about a man whose family has been chasing the legend of a treasure for centuries, played by Nicolas Cage.  Unlike the rest of his family, Cage's character discovers the first clue but in doing so also creates a rival for the treasure. Of course the goal is to get the treasure.

Overall I liked the movie.  The movie had humor, action, and just enough who-dunit to make the movie watcher not already know most of the plot.  So, if you're looking for decent entertainment for the whole family or just you, then this is it, but don't expect to be awed and inspired.",1120867200,,748,4.391304347826087
1526321,5,B00005JN5E,"_National Treasure_ is a thrilling adventure movie in the spirit of _Indiana Jones_ which casts light on the hidden history of early America.  The movie features a secret treasure, preserved down the centuries by masonic inheritors of the tradition of the Knights Templar, eventually winding up in America.  The main character is a treasure hunter who has devoted his life to finding this treasure and is regarded by those in the historical community as a crank.  He originally became enthralled in his quest as a young boy when he found a secret in his grandfather's attic.  After nearly being blown to bits by dynamite in a sunken ship in the Arctic, the hero must travel to Washington, D. C. to prevent his nemesis from stealing the Constitution of the United States.  Apparently, according to the movie, the founding fathers were composed of masons who sought to protect the treasure by hiding it.  However, they managed to provide a treasure map on the back of the Constitution written in invisible ink.  The story unfolds as the hero attempts to prevent his nemesis from getting to the treasure first, and in the process a great deal of the hidden history of the United States of America is revealed.  This movie provides a great source of entertainment, and offers an allegorical initiatic Grail quest for the unsuspecting movie goer.",1120780800,2,1341,4.902654867256637
1526322,5,B00005JN5E,"Dan Brown has said the his next Langdon novel will take place in Washington DC and concern the Knights Templar and the Freemasons.  Well, that could be an accurate description of this film.  Oddly enough it has certain traits in common with THE DAVINCI CODE.  Namely, like the CODE, the plotting is fast and furious, but the history and other details is lacking.  While Brown did such things as having a jet turn around in a hanger with its jets on (yeah, right), this movie does such things as having people run around DC waving guns and not getting noticed.

Benjamin Gates (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Nick in the film) belongs to a family that guards the last clue to a treasure greater than any man should have (and his name is Gates?).  Many members of his family have tried to unravel the clue that they guard and as a result have wasted money and ruined reputations.  But Ben manages to figure out the clue and that leads to a new clue that has something to due with the Declaration of Independence.  It also causes a schism in the treasure hunting party and now two groups are after the treasure.  One clue leads to another and we are treated to a tour of our nation's historical places.  Unfortunately many of the facts revealed are false.

But despite the false information, the movie is quite fun and very enjoyable.  Cage, who has been an action hero, does a great job as the action anti-hero.  An excellent cast supports his efforts.  The writing is fast and entertaining.  Cage at one point has to give a false name and uses Brown (wonder where that came from).  This is fun and adventure that the whole family can enjoy.

For those who want to know a little more about the mistakes, read on.  Lemon juice, as many kids know, is an invisible ink that is revealed when heated.  Used as it is in the movie, it would have obscured the clues, not revealed them.  Daylight savings was not in use during the Revolution as mentioned but they forgot that time zones did not exits and that towns and cities based their Noon time on when the sun was directly overhead.  The Declaration was signed on August 2 (John Adams misremembered the date as July 4 and it stuck.  It was not signed all at once, it took months.  The original signed Declaration is not the one on display at the National Archives, that is one of the copies that was made for each state legislature to approve (there are currently more than a dozen of these still surviving).  I will leave it to you to figure out which version has ""unalienable rights"" and which has ""inalienable rights"".  The secret catacombs are located in an area that has been excavated more than just about anywhere in the country (if such a place existed there, there would be a water pumping station, subway or other tunnel running right through it.

To me, I thought it was a little disrespectful to a piece of U.S. history that so many people adore. There was one actor (Stewart Finlay-McLennan) that I just LOVE who played one of the ""bad guys"". So that part was a little enjoyable for me by making this film easier to swallow. It all depends on taste. Pretty much everyone in my family loved it, I just don't seem to understand where they're getting at with the movie. What was so good about it?

1526345,5,B00005JN5E,"I've seen a lot of comparison between this movie and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's true that they do both involve searches for a hidden treasure of historical significance, but in my opinion that's about where the similarity ends. (What's harder for me to understand is why it seems to gall some people so much that this movie was a big success.)

Anyway, I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers or by the title of my own. I'll just say that I was skeptical about this movie but wound up really enjoying it; I rented it first, but now I'm planning to buy it.

P.S. For those of you who criticized this movie for being a rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it might interest you to know that Spielberg himself admits that ""Raiders"" was a rip-off of old movie serials he used to watch and enjoy as a kid.

1526346,2,B00005JN5E,"I've studied the American Revolution and seeing the historical places and documents is interesting. And this movie was filmed at these actual places like the Lincoln Memorial, the place where they signed the Declaration of Independence, the Old North Church in Boston, etc.

But, sadly, that's about the only thing good about this movie. The plot stretches reality to the breaking point. Cage has to steal the Declaration to save it? Give me a break. If a thief could steal the Declaration, it would have already been stolen. The Declaration, itself, can't be worth that much less than the treasure. And the developing love between Cage and that German immigrant is just as surreal as the idea of there being a secret map on the back of the Declaration.

And if you're going to excuse reality, can't you come up with a more interesting ending of where the treasure is? After, spending the bulk of the movie in historically important places like Washington DC and Philadelphia, where the treasure ultimately ended up was lame (I won't tell you in case you haven't seen it). I would have at least been amused if the treasure ended up being buried at Washington's home at Mount Vernon or Jefferson's Monticello. That would have been cool if they had to exhume Washington's grave and found a clue by studying Washington's false teeth or something like that.

A two hour movie based on these ludicrous ideas is, as Thomas Paine would say, the ""times that try men's souls.""

There are tons of great acting names in the film as well and they happen to be some of my faves: Nick Cage is a superb hero, Sean Bean is terrific as the villian, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight and a short cameo by Christopher Plummer.

1526352,3,B00005JN5E,"I generally enjoy watching Nicholas Cage movies, and this one was no exception.  The premise was a bit far-fetched, but the story was nevertheless reasonably well told and produced.  It offered a great action-adventure story without the usual elements of wanton violence, heavy language, the obligatory sex scene, etc.  I felt perfectly comfortable letting my kids, ages 13 and 9, watch this one with us.

My only real complaints are that the characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the plot line had a few significant holes in it.  I thought Cage's character, Benjamin Franklin Gates, was just a little too slick in figuring out the riddles and clues, almost entirely without error, while his evil counterpart, Ian, was only slightly less so.  I also thought Gates came across as excessively altruistic, but I guess that's okay since this is a Disney flick -- family values and all that.

In my estimation the biggest plot gaps occurred right at the beginning of the movie.  First, one wonders how, within a few short decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all clues to the treasure's location had been lost, except one, which was passed on to the original Gates ancestor and just happened to be the one clue that led to all the others.  Much bigger, though, [SPOILER ALERT!  SPOILER ALERT!] was how Ben Gates figured out that ""Charlotte"" was a ship and where to find it.  I also thought it was a bit incongruous how the FBI was initially portrayed in a very negative light, only to enjoy the balance of the movie as a bunch of high tech superstuds.

Notwithstanding these minor lapses, I quickly got over them and settled into the movie.  It was a rolicking good yarn if you have enough sense not to take it too seriously.  It also has a lot of intellectual appeal as you try to unravel the clues along with Ben Gates -- although he was much more astute about it than I, of course.  Good movie.

I've often wondered about Free Masonry, their old history and secret rituals that some Christian groups claim are Satanic.  All the better to build a screenplay full of historical side notes about the Founding Fathers; eight including Ben Franklin and George Washington were Masons.

For those who simply can't wait until ""The DaVinci Code"" makes its way to the big screen, there's ""National Treasure"" to serve as a sort of second hand substitute in the meantime.  Like the Dan Brown bestseller, this is a wildly improbable caper tale set in the context of historical fiction.

Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a man who has spent his whole adult life in pursuit of a treasure that he believes the Founding Fathers hid in the late 18th Century, a search that has obsessed and ruined the lives of his own forebears for generations.  He is teamed with Ian (Sean Bean), a less savory fortune hunter who has no qualms about breaking the law or eliminating anyone who stands in the way of getting what he wants.  When these two men become convinced that there is an invisible map leading to the treasure hidden on the back of the original Declaration of Independence, the highly-principled Ben opts to forego the treasure, while Ian decides to steal the priceless document.  It is only when Ben realizes that he must steal the document in order to save it from Ian`s diabolical clutches that he springs into action.  From then on, it becomes a race against time, as Ben and his cohorts try to unearth the clues and crack the codes that lead to the treasure before Ian and his henchmen can do the same - all while being chased by FBI agents who are hot on his tail.  Frankly, one would have thought that the Founding Fathers - what with a war to fight and a nation to found - would have had more important things to do with their time than devise all the elaborate plotting necessary to set up this search.  But, apparently, one would have been wrong.

The movie may be fine fun for 12-year-old boys of all ages, but the rest of us will find much of it cheesy and unconvincing.  There's always a certain satisfaction that comes with watching stories like these - that of following the clues and then piecing together all the fragments to achieve the full picture - but ""National Treasure"" is really only mildly diverting even in its best moments.  Those generally come when we find ourselves at great historic sites such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Old North Church etc.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is generally inane, and the acting - well, let's just say that's it's performances like this one that make it increasingly difficult to remember that Cage once walked off the stage clutching an Academy statuette for best actor in his hands.  Too often the film feels juvenile and slapdash, especially in the romantic pairing of Cage and Diane Kruger, as a curator of the National Archives who reluctantly comes along for the ride.

The Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves.",1119744000,5,2735,4.656964656964657
1526443,4,B00005JN5E,"""National Treasure"" is a fun movie and one you can feel comfortable watching with you kids.  This kind of a mystery story has a long tradition.  It mixes real historical names, a few facts, stirs in some myths and fantasies about mason and knights templar, add some bits about treasure and a nasty villain, and then sprinkles all that on a whole loaf of nonsense and ends up with a light and fluffy bit of fun.

I am not sure why this film causes such passion among those that do not like it.  It really is not that important of a film.  It is a simple family entertainment and succeeds at that quite well.  My kids love it, and I was able to watch it more as a Hardy Boys kind of story to keep from exploding, but then most fictions with any pretensions of reality set me off.

There is a lot of running, gunshots that seldom hit anyone, a big explosion, some fire, a quirky sidekick for Cage's character and a beautiful girl for the hero to win and protect.  I enjoyed the fact that there was romance instead of sex and there was dialogue without swearing.  I felt entertained instead of oppressed.

While the premise is a bit strained (Freemasons and the Knights Templar his an astounding treasure ages ago, leaving subtle clues hidden in historical documents to lead modern-day treasure hunters to the cache), how many other movies offer thin premises for movies? Answer: LOTS of them.

Nicholas Cage plays a historian obsessed with American history. (When he was a young child, his grandfather told him a family legend about a clue that led to a marvelous hidden treasure. The family's search for the treasure has made them academic laughing-stocks and has put remendous pressure on family relationships.) As an adult, he continues his search for the treasure, facing considerable personal danger (as well as a heaping dose of excitement) along the way.

I thought National Treasure was a great family movie. It did smack of The DaVinci Code, but so what? Many popular movies are derivations of other stories. Lots of action, not too much violence, clean language, and even a history angle! I love adventures! (I got goosebumps a few times.)

They are as indelible as original sin, as sure as death and taxes, as certain as the sun will rise in the east and W will continue to fester in the Oval Office. One of those axiomatic principles is that any movie, a priori in the strictest Kantian sense, with Nicholas Cage blows. And this one may blow a louder fart than any film I have ever seen. I must confess here that I am being rudely ungrateful to Amazon who from the goodness of their hearts sent me a copy for being such a good customer, and I honestly am flattered by the thought. But this is pure sh*te. Cage, were he not related to another overrated Hollywood type (what's the last good movie he made? Apocalypse, right?), would be a bartender or a disc josckey or being a sax player in a wedding band. This guy can't act. Nothing that he has ever been in has been anything other than awful.

And it's all wrong here. The script is the worst written and worst delivered load of preposterous junk I have ever heard. When you see a scene at the North Pole and no one is shivering, there's a credibility gap that just broadens as the celluloid spills out. The movie is noisy, laden with explosions and cheesey special effects that make the B movies of the 50's seem like Fellini.

I can't imagine what Sean Bean is doing in this film. He must not have been paid very much for LOTR. He delivers his lines and the look on his pathetic face tells you this was a money grab. It is melodramatic, infantile, arrested devlopment fueled bad adventure movie making. It is hyped as a new spin on Indiana Jones. Cage is so hamfisted and just plain bad that he makes the wooden Harrison Ford seem like Laurence Olivier.

Now the comparison:

Goonies is funny, NT is not.

Goonies is entertaining, NT is not.

In Goonies the kids are trying to save thier parents homes from foreclosure, in NT a crackpot is trying to seek fame and redemption for a misspent life.

and the most important... in Goonies they had to follow the clues to get to the treaaure, in NT they took you on a 2 hour scavenger hunt to find something that the janitor almost tripped over.

Which leads us to this movies biggest failure.... WHY SPEND AN ENTIRE FILM GOING FROM CLUE TO CLUE TO CLUE WHEN THE TREASURE ROOM HAS A BACK DOOR THATS RIGHT NEXT TO THE JANITORS CLOSET!

I mean come on!  We watch Nick Cage drive all over antarctic looking for a sunken ship that contains a pipe which leads to the declaration of indepenndance which he needs to steal to find a map which he has to decode many times over which takes him to some stupid glasses which takes him somewhere else and then somewhere else again all the while being chased by a group of villians who are nothing short of laughable and cliche.  FINALLY after 2 hours we arive at a cript, we pop it open and go down some dangerous stairs, solve another mystery which leads us into another room, then we use a magic key to open up the treasure room.  HERES THE PROBLEM, they are trapped in the treasure room because of the old stairs collapsing right?  WRONG, there is a back door to the treasure room that leads right to the tomb next to the secret one.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Basically my point is that when Cage finally pops out the back door of the treasure room he is standing right next to the janitor who could have easily tripped over the treasure Cage had to steal the DOI to find?  WHAT A DUMB A$$ MOVIE!

The 'parent' was saying pretty much the only reason you wouldn't like it was if you wanted to hear cursing and see sex.  Okay, sorry but the reason you wouldn't like this is because it's kinda stupid.  That's not to say it's not fun, it's just cheesy.  I had no desire to see this movie, none whatsoever, because (i'm sorry 'parent' for this but) IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY STUPID!!!  I'm not a real Cage fan, other than movies like 'Matchstick Men' which I thought was great.  My wife wanted to see this because her mother said it was great and my mother said it was great and her best friend said it was great but we never went to the theater because I didn't want to waste money on this movie (we saw 'Finding Neverland' instead) and so just this Friday we rented it much to my disspleasure.  I do have to say that as corny and plain dumb the plot is, the movie was very fun.  I actually enjoyed it.  I'm sure you all know the plot, Ben Franklen Gates (Cage) is a treasure hunter (or protecter, whatever) and he's been serching for the same treasure ever since he was a little boy.  I guess somewhere along the way the Gates family name was tarnished and they were all thought to be insane or just stupid (kinda like the premise of the movie)...Cage finally figures out the clue he has to find this treaure only to find out that there is just another clue, and this clue leads him to the Decloration of Independence...His partner in crime here decides they are going to steal the DoI, but when Gates objects they become enemies and now Gates is racing against the clock to stop this man from stealing the document.  Now Gates realizes he needs to steal it himself.  So he does.  And now he has the chance to uncover the rest of the clues to find the treasure.  It's fast paced, and just plain fun, no matter how stupid it is.  So this is for the 'parent' who thinks if we didn't like this movie it's because we want sex and language, your wrong.  Heck, I don't mind the occational nude scene or bloody mess of a shootout or something, but what matters most to me is plot.  I was impresed with this movie namely becasue it was fun, but it was pointless.  Yes it's a great family movie because there is no cussing and no sex and my kids can watch it and not repeat things they shouldn't, but even you have to admit the premise is just plain STUPID...the critics were right and I wholeheartedly agree...it's not a good movie as far as GOOD movies go, but it is a fun movie and one your kids can watch so as a movie goer you have to make the choice yourself, do you want a  good plot and your occational 'F' word or do you want mindless entertainment that your kids can watch with you?  Or do you rent the good movie and watch it when your kids go to sleep, maybe put this on for them while your at work?  It's up to you.",1119225600,,2921,4.227027027027027
1526511,2,B00005JN5E,While I am a Nicholas Cage fan this is definitely not one of his finer works.  The plot is not only not believable but also not enough to keep you interested in the movie.  This was definitely a Indiana Jones wanna be that did not have it.,1119139200,,239,4.0638297872340425
1526512,4,B00005JN5E,"Typically I try to avoid anything that has to do with Jerry Bruckheimer (how does his last name pass spell check?) at all cost considering I'm not a big fan of watching things blow up surrounded by a lousy plot. Black Hawk Down is one of the few movies I've seen that he was attached to that didn't suck massively. Seriously, how can you possibly mess up a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well by poorly ripping off Titanic I guess. So I broke down this weekend and picked up National Treasure and hoped Bruckheimer actually devised a plot for the movie.

National Treasure follows a family in search of a long lost treasure that was supposedly hidden by our founding founders. Nick Cage plays the son who is still searching for it while Jon Voight is the skeptical dad whose life was ruined by unsuccessfully looking. With the son being the treasure hunter (or as Cage's Ben Gates says, ""Treasure protectors"") and dad being skeptical, parallels are easily drawn with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They even throw in a hot German chick just for fun. But the German chick in this movie has been nationalized and has access to the Declaration of Independence. That, of course, comes in handy when Gates needs to steal it.

Gates need to steal the Declaration of Independence because his former partner, evil English dude, plans to steal it to use it to find the treasure for his own personal collection. Rounding out the cast is Gates' sidekick, Riley (think Short Round from Temple of Doom but older and less Asian), and Harvey Keitel in a rare good guy turn as the FBI agent who is looking for Gates.

The plot is surprisingly decent. They is a good balance between historically accuracy and aspects that were made up to go with the storyline. You can really tell that some did their homework to make sure what could be accurate is and what is made up could be plausible. As for the action, Bruckheimer kept the big explosions to only one, which has to be a record low for him. The biggest disappointment I had with the action was, if you remember back to the trailer (which is missing from the DVD release, I hate when that happens), Gates is holding on to the hot German chick and asks her; ""Do you trust me?"" And she say, ""yes"" than Gates drops her. Everybody and their mothers were like ""Whoa"" when they first saw it but when you see it in the context of the film, it is obvious that she really isn't in any danger.

As for the extras on the DVD, I mentioned earlier that it lack the theatrical trailer yet it had the Verison commercial that when along with the film for some reason. It also had a nice documentary about present day treasure hunters and another one about the making of the movie. It also had the prerequisite deleted scenes, neither of which were that interesting. It also had an alternate ending, and to honest they went with the better ending in the movie. The cool thing about the extras is they give you clues that will help you unlock some more extra materials.",1119052800,,2987,4.495395948434623
1526513,4,B00005JN5E,"This movie has done something that very few others movies have achieved.  It has contained all the things that people look for in a movie (comedy, drama, romance, action) and kept it well within the PG range.

That's right!!!  No nudity, no sexuality, no swearing, no gore, and no toilet humor.  It even had some educational value.  I've seen PG cartoons that didn't behave this well.  My hats off for making a movie like this.  It is soooo nice to have a movie that I'm not afraid to have my 8-year-old watch.

This movie is very entertaining and well paced.  There is some action but even when it slows down so we can catch our breath it remains entertaining.  It isn't the smartest movie out there, but it is smarter than most of the crap that Hollywood wants to spoon-feed us.  And nobody ever gets lost watching this film.

Also, I like the character of this film.  Especially the character of Benjamin Franklin Gates, the movie's protagonist.  This is someone who really wants to do well for others.  Even when what he does seems wrong on the surface, he is doing it for the right reasons (ie, he lies about his name and steals, of all things, the Declaration of Independence).  Again, this is better than the brand of heroes that Hollywood pushes down our throats.

I wish Hollywood would take notes on this film.  There is a lot here that is good (no, no... excellent) that critics were more than happy to ignore.  And America, no, the world loves it.  It has grossed over a third of a billion dollars worldwide in ticket sales... that doesn't include DVD sales.  If more movies like this would be made then the box office slump Hollywood is concerned about would go away.  Give us more, we are demanding it!!",1118880000,3,1717,4.52442996742671

We have a search for treasure that begins with a secret message on the Declaration of Independence (What?) and ends in a spooky grotto. Still, everything comes out fine at the end. The story almost lost me at the start. First, they have a stunning blonde in charge of things at the National Archives. Is this the same National Archives that I have visited? Second, the blonde plays fast and loose with the Declaration of Independence. That's even more difficult to imagine. But then the story settles down to one chase after another among our nation's historic sites, so you can just hang on and let it race off in all directions. It should entertain children as well as adults, and I don't recall any cussing, nudity, gore, or sex. That makes it a family picture, so sit back and enjoy it.",1118880000,,957,4.505747126436781

I like the way the movie changed from having a couple of nuts going after a legend to a cat and mouse game of adversaries.  I don't know how much is true about this film but the National Archives had more security than I had thought.  The film also gives you a feeling of National Pride when the good guy steal something so that the bad guys can't get it because he want to protect it.

The romantic situations are pretty pridictable but that doesn't really matter. I enjoyed the film and it is a very good action adventure.

The best part about this being on DVD is finding out all the coding techiques in the extras and the additional features you get if you solve the puzzles.

1526518,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is similar to Frankenstein's monster.  Both are dumb, cobbled together from the bits and pieces of other, better things and require a major suspension of disbelief.  Yet somehow, also like the Monster, National Treasure is, in the end, rather likeable.

The premise of the story is that a number of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were aware of a massive treasure and decided to hide it behind a series of cryptic clues.  (Why the Founding Fathers would allow their young nation to struggle financially while they had such massive amounts of gold and relics is never explained.)  The only person who can possibly find said treasure is Nicholas Cage, who plays the descendant of the last man entrusted with the secret riddle.  Sean Bean plays his adversary who is motivated by simple greed.

The first clue points to the Declaration of Independence, which apparently has a map on the back written in invisible ink.  Since Bean intends to steal the document, Cage knows he needs to steal it first.  They both decide to rob the National Archives at the same time, fortunately while a big fundraiser is going on.  Cage's initial success begins a series of cat-and-mouse chases between him and Bean with the FBI not far behind.

I can almost picture the pitch meeting at the studio for this one.  ""The Da Vinci Code is hot.  Let's make our own version and throw in a bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  There is very little original here and the script sounds like it was written by committee, with one one-liner after another.  Nonetheless, it is entertaining, even if it is a bit of fluff, and the DVD has some nice extra features, including a mini-treasure hunt that unlocks other menus.  Overall, it gets a weak four stars; National Treasure may be shallow, but it is fun, and isn't that what we typically go to the movies for anyway?",1118534400,3,1864,4.70679012345679

The movie was better than I have expected. It was gripping and exciting and I was on the edge of my chair most of the time. It talks about the conspiracy theories of American's forefathers who kept the secrets of the treasure because it is of too great a value and men would be corrupted to it. In the end, naturally, Nicholas Cage found the clues to it but not after a grueling, exciting chase and hide-and-seek with the police and bad guys.

I have seen this movie in the theater in November 2004, and I thought it was great, just like the ""Spider-Man"" movie series!

Now, after months of waiting so hard, you can get this on DVD!

Funny, no VHS copies were at my Blockbuster store when this came out; could this be the death of VHS? But I LOOOOOOOVE DVD, anyway. The widescreen picture and rumbling sound are EXCELLENT, plus the disc art is AWESOME - a golden eye pyramid from the back of the $1 bill over a greyish-black background!

I even checked out the games on this disc. The ""Decode This!"" game was fun and educational, plus you can enter codes to access other menus. (The problem is, to figure out one of the codes, you have to fast-forward through the first four bonus features [all documentaries] on page one before continuing onto page two.) The second menu had that game. I also like the Verizon commercial as well. (Are they available in Canada?) And get this - after minutes of gruel, hard work on this disc, trying to figure out the master code, I was expecting a more challenging game like on the ""Beauty and the Beast"" second disc, but what's it really? A truncated version of the ""Bonus Treasure Hunt"" menu! LOL

Another downside is that there's no Spanish sound on this. Sure, there's Spanish subtitles, but it's not like watching the Spanish networks! (I actually like to watch DVDs in Spanish in addition to English BTW)

Other than that, pure genius! ""National Treasure"" is an awesome action movie the whole family can watch! Again, it's right there with ""Spider-Man 1 and 2""! Get it now!",1118361600,,1734,4.706270627062707

The actors did a good job, and I was also happy that there were no extended make-out scenes, although there was a love interest.

As an added bonus, the bullets all miss, the language is clean, and the gore is at a minimum.  There is even a little sultry spark without nudity.  This movie proves that Hollywood can still create a fun film without rampant vulgarity.

I had never heard of her before this movie came out.  Justin Bartha was the comic relief and seemed to be very funny.  I thought this movie was just going to be one of those stupid treasure movies that has gotten worn out.  I was wrong.  I bought this on dvd and loved the sourround sound and picture.  This is a very creative way on how to steal the Decleration of Independence and the way that they got to steal the decleration was very realistic.  The only thing that was not realistic was when the three went around town and no one reported them to the police.  They would have been all over the news and it would be the biggest story in news.  That took a star away from this product.  jon turtelab did some unique piece of directingand thankyou Walt Disney for a great film for all ages.,1117843200,,948,4.269662921348314
1526707,5,B00005JN5E,"As I've said before, a movie doesn't have to be historically correct or realistic to be great.  A great story, great cast, and a great score pretty much make a great movie.

  The story starts when a young Benjamin Gates (later played by Nicholas Cage) is told a story, from his grandfather, about treasure hidden by the Freemasons somewhere in the U.S.  They left clues around us, on the dollar bill, the back of the Declaration of Independance, and in other historical places.  Young Benjamin becomes extremely interested in this tale.  His father, who spent a good deal of his life searching for this treasure, tells him it is only a false story, that there is no treasure.

  The story picks up years later as Ben is in Antarctica searching for a mysterious ship.  (I will stop here as I do not want to spoil the story for anyone.)

  Ben, (Nicholis Cage), Dr. Chase (Diane Kruger), Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and Ian Howe (Sean Bean), all perform their parts nicely.  Ben as a solemn treasure-seaker, Dr. Chase as a specialist in U.S. history,  Riley as a funny, intelligent computer whiz, and Ian as a greedy, rich man intent on getting the treasure for himself.  They all did a great job.

  The score is quite capable of sending a shiver down your spine and uses an electric guitar very nicely.  I recommend the soundtrack along with the DVD.

  If you like good, clean action/adventure movies National Treasure is a must-have.",1117843200,,1437,4.678714859437751
1526708,5,B00005JN5E,"I didn't read ""The Da Vinci Code"" because I'm not going to read something simply because everyone else is. That's just me. Whether this rips it off or not is irrelevant to me. It makes American history seem exciting and your kids will love it. It may even get them to become a little more interested in the subject in school, you never know. Whether the plot is ""ludacris"" or not doesn't really matter, either. It's a movie! I thought it was well done and suspenseful, and never thought once about historical innacuracies or improbabilities. I accepted that this was a work of fiction. Nic Cage was great, and also, the comic relief side-kick character, Riley, whereas most characters such as this are irritating and predictable, this guy was actually pretty funny at times. In conclusion, if you have kids, and you actually like spending time with them, rather than sending them to their rooms with their own computers and televisions and neglecting them for your own selfish needs like a lot of parents do -- if you actually enjoy the company of your children, buy this movie and enjoy it together.",1117670400,4,1100,4.734375

If you are a fan of Washington, DC the movie has a lot of good scenes filmed there.  The sound and video are both outstanding, and the extras are enjoyable.  I found a little feature on real treasure hunters to be informative.  So grab the popcorn, grandma, the kid and some neighbors and put on a good old fashioned adventure story.

1526710,4,B00005JN5E,"I just saw this movie and couldn't understand all the horrible reviews I'd read.  It's a great flick--intelligent without being too complex (so you get into the story without wondering too much about the technicalities of whether all the ""facts"" are accurate or not), action-packed without being anything like some bloodbaths, and powered by noble intentions.

The fact that the bad guy who doesn't care anything about the Declaration of Independence and what it stands for appears to be English bothered me a little.  Okay, it could happen; there could be a bad English guy who didn't care about the Declaration.  Still, I would rather have seen someone with an American accent in this role--Amazon is loaded with reviews complaining about the unfair portrayal of Americans in Love Actually, but I don't see a lot of English people complaining about unfair portrayal of Brits in this movie.

But I hate to dwell on stereotypes, and I really doubt that Disney intended to perpetuate one with the bad guy's character.

I've seen people comparing this movie to the Indiana Jones movies, and I like this one better!  The gory images of Indiana Jones haunted me in childhood, but National Treasure sticks to suspense for most of its thrills.

As someone who minored in anthropology in college, I can't really condone the treatment of important archaeological sites in the movie.  Since it is just a movie (and the plot explains why time is of the essence), the archaeological aspect wouldn't bother me if it weren't for one of the DVD bonus features.  The feature talks about treasure hunters and how to get started as a treasure hunter, but it doesn't point out that people need to respect burials and remains or that they should report important finds and try to leave sites as intact as possible.  We didn't watch all the bonus features, so there may be some mention of this kind of thing elsewhere on the DVD.

The DVD extras are fun, though.  It's clever to have different levels of features open as clues are figured out.  I'm not sure I'd want to go through the process repeatedly, but it's entertaining once or twice.

Now, mind you, Nicolas Cage is almost laughably bad, and the dialogue rather stinks.  The plot is inane.  The characters? Well, they're like that 2-dimensional creature from the old Outer Limits episode ... the one that disappears completely when it turns to the left or right.

1526781,4,B00005JN5E,"I liked this movie. Lots of adventure, history and it reminds me of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Some of it is a little formulaic and you might roll your eyes when 200+ year old torches light up like they were made yesterday, but the story is intriguing and gets your attention. If you don't know the story line by now it involves Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates whose Family has been convinced about a massive treasure older than colonized America, hidden away during the revolutionary years. Through each succeding clue he finally learns that there is a map on the back of the Declarition of Independance, the only drawback is his partner has turned on him and is going to steal it for himself. No on in the government will listen to him, so Gates decides he'll steal it first to protect the document and the treasure. Lots of High-Tech action, spooky Mason intrigue and history, although some of it is a little questionable. All in all, definetely recommended.",1117152000,2,961,4.6923076923076925
1526782,4,B00005JN5E,"One of the first things taught at journalism schools is that most ""news stories"" are to be written at a 6th grade level of education - the editorial page is the place for more erudite discussion.  National Treasure is written at a level that would make the ""average"" person think ""hey, that's pretty clever!"", keeping in mind that the ""average"" person might not know that Benjamin Franklin wrote anonymous letters to newspapers while a teenager under the name ""Silence Dogood"". (He wrote hundreds of OTHER letters under other fictitious names as well and, given the piddling state of education in the U.S. I'd guess that the ""average"" person doesn't know that Old Ben was also ""Poor Richard"" or even know what his almanac was all about.) But I digress. Some people love to trash things that they think aren't up to their level, and so ""National Treasure"" didn't receive stellar reviews from the professional critics. I think it's safe to say the movie wasn't made for professional critics.

It's an entertaining little adventure and anyone who claims that it has no clever parts must be very clever indeed.  Much of the movie is a historical scavenger hunt that the founding fathers have laid out for the person who can decipher the clues - with the treasure of the Templar Knights at the end of the rainbow.  One of the first clues is carved into the stem of a meerschaum pipe. The stem of the pipe detaches from the carved bowl, and  has raised etchings.  Our hero figures out that these etchings are intended to be used like an ink stamp, so he pricks his finger to use his blood as ink and rolls the pipe stem out to reveal the next clue.  I thought that was pretty clever.

The hero, Benjamin Franklin Gates, is the Grandson of John Adams Gates, and the Gates have been thought of as the mad scientists of American History because every generation has handed down the story of the hidden treasure and spends decades of their life trying to find the treasure, or at least get other historians to take them seriously.  The plot takes them to Washington (to steal the Declaration of Independence in a concise little caper that's at least as clever as the one in ""After the Sunset"", and THAT was SUPPOSED to be a ""caper"" movie.) Ben has an assistant named Riley who serves two purposes: to add clever little comments like ""so who wants to go down the creepy tunnel first?"" and to provide someone that Ben can give exposition to: such as who Silence Dogood was.  Diane Kruger is the love interest - a Washington Ph. D. who works at the National Archives.  She's the pretty face used to represent all the keepers of the Declaration of Independence.  Sean Bean is a rival treasure hunter and the movie goes to great lengths to show that Heroic Ben is only after the treasure for it's historical significance while Bean's Ian is only out for the money.  Harvey Keitel plays the FBI agent who becomes interested after the Declaration is stolen, but he's little more than a plot marker himself.  A couple of times he gets to say ""SOMEBODY's going to prison.""

Hmmmm... Will good Ben or Evil Ian be the one going to prison?  Will Ben and company find the magnificent treasure? For the answers to those questions check out National Treasure.... but is it too much of a clue if I tell you it's a Disney movie?",1117152000,13,3301,4.58843537414966

If you like ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Pirates of the Carribean"", this film is a must see. Be sure to bring your kids, though, because they're sure to love it too!",1117065600,2,497,4.354838709677419

1526785,2,B00005JN5E,"Is anybody surprised at all that this film held the number one spot at the box office for three weeks? I mean it seems to be the magic formula that no movie fan can resist: Explosions, buried treasure, and . . .oh yea, not a thought in its head. While this film is very clearly borrowing from ""The Da Vinci Code"" there was clearly no thought put into the ""puzzles"" in this film. Say what you will about that book (I liked it) Dan Brown at least had to think about his puzzles, he had to know about history and art history and he had to see things in paintings that other people thought nothing of. The makers of this film threw together some puzzles that are just obscure and beyond impossible. Lucky for us the characters in this film are geniuses and can solve riddles in mere seconds that in reality nobody could ever solve. This film also plays to the American mindset which thinks that any means can be justified if you wrap it in something honorable. When Ben Gates declared that he had to steal the Declaration of Independence because otherwise somebody else would steal it, I couldn't help but think about Bush's justification for hijacking the Iraqi oilfields.  This movie has other problems as well. For example, they forgot to give their wisecracker wisecracks. It was especially unfortunate for them that I have been watching season 3 of the ""Gilmore Girls"" lately, a show that excels in witty banter. It was also pretty annoying to me that peril never played a major role in this film. Never once did we really think that the heroes were in any danger. If you get left in the bottom of a cave just walk to the back wall and push the button. . .uh-huh. Why couldn't a password problem stall their mission? Why didn't they have to do research once? The answer of course being that there is no time for research when you are blowing stuff up! This film did have its moments, but most of the action sequences were ruined by some overzealous writer who had way too many ""great"" ideas (""Why don't we have Nicolas Cage block bullets with the Declaration of Independence?""). Whereas lots of films flaunt the fact that you don't need a brain cell in your head to enjoy them (""Van Wilder"" anybody?), this one was cute and tried to feed you historical myths (that I'm pretty sure they made up) in place of educational content. I found that a little insulting. **1/2",1116979200,2,2367,4.504651162790697
1526856,4,B00005JN5E,"I think when watching a movie you have to tailor your expectations to what the makers were trying to do with their film. With that in mind National Treasure delivers: a broad, completely ridiculous plot, a hero you can root for, a villain wtih unlimited resources who will stop at nothing to achieve his ends, wild over-the-top action scenes and a little romance and comic relief thrown in with the kitchen sink. There is enough history that we all know to keep you interested in the story until they throw history at you that you didn't know which provides the ultimate twist and turns. I've read complaints about the acting but I didn't see a problem with it. This was never meant to be Shakespeare so just pop the DVD back in and have some fun.",1116979200,2,747,4.5
1526857,3,B00005JN5E,"All I could think about while watching this film was its marketing genius. I mean, it had action, a big name actor, a big name director, and a plot that people love (i.e., the quest for lost treasure mixed with history). What's not to like?

From an entertainment standpoint, I found the film interesting but not compelling or gripping. It was some mindless fun with action sequences, neat little gadgets, a great villain, a geek/comedian, and a little romance stirred in.

The acting pretty much sucked, though. Which really bothered me. I love Nicholas Cage (for the most part). But here he seemed to just be going through the motions, page by screenplay page.

And then there's the ending. Disneyland officials must be drooling over this. Close to the end, there's a set of scenes on a makeshift stairway beneath a church in New York. The stairway lurches this way and that as the actors jumped, stumbled, and fell across the wooden planks. My immediate thought after seeing this (especially since this title is owned by Disney) was: ""A new ride at Disneyland!""

Be wary the marketing genius.",1116979200,,1095,4.808510638297872
1526858,1,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure was a failure as a film.  While the monetary figures will not support this comment, I will say that upon viewing this film, it is nothing but accurate.  From the clichd story, to the cheap acting, to even the simplistic ""clues"" National Treasure proved that if you have a big named actor in the lead, some pre-high school history, and a powerhouse producer (and the big Pirates of the Caribbean passion) that you could literally sell a screen door on a submarine.  What was the excitement behind this film?  Why is there still a waiting list at my video store for this title?  There was nothing of value from the beginning to end of this film that would ever cause the hysteria that I have seen so far.  Nicolas Cage proves to the world that he is the male version of Marisa Tomei (questioning his choices after his deserved Oscar win), and that he has the ability to run, jump, and reason with the greatest of speed.  Acting wasn't necessarily needed, just the ability to look smarter than one truly is.

With my questions posed as to how the success of this film became a part of American cinema, I thought back to this film.  The acting was atrocious.  Nic Cage looked and acted just like a mannequin throughout this entire film.  There was no range of emotion or excitement in anyway.  His romantic involvement with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) was like watching two complete strangers try to build a passionate relationship in ten minutes.  It was awkward, cheesy, and embarrassing for all those involved.  Even the acting from the ""comic relief"" of the film, Cage's sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) seemed forced.  His jokes didn't make me laugh once, but instead made me feel uneasy and cheated out of some hard earned cash plopped down for this film.  To have a successful ""action-adventure"" film, you must have it firmly stapled with some decent acting.  If big stars are only going to water down your film (as in the case of National Treasure), then you must find smaller stars and build upon the story.  These are simple rules, which nobody in this production followed.

With no acting in place, I was forced to watch the story unfold before my eyes.  Actually, the story felt like a crumpled piece of paper thrown at me.  There was no direction, no points for me to follow, but instead haphazard movement by our actors and director to keep the flow of the film in motion instead of becoming stale.  Sadly, they were unable to do this.  From the opening ""clue"" to the final one, there was little to no explanation as to why nobody else had found this treasure, or how local historians had never found the hidden artifacts scattered around hugely populated areas.  I would understand if we were searching cornfields, but we were in metropolises and nobody discovered these clues until today.  It was just rather unbelievable to me.  I felt like this story was yelling at me.  Violently forcing me to follow each clue without explanation, but out of sheer hope that something bigger would happen.  I work better when there is some moment of ""why"" thrown into the mix.  A moment that allows the viewers to think for themselves instead of being treated like children.  After viewing this film, that was how I felt.  I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions, but instead the power of Bruckheimer was forcing me to think in one way, and one way only.  It hurt this film and upset me until the final credits arrived.

Finally, I would like to say (because I am sure that most are upset with my dislike of this film) that another point that hurt this film was the lack of action.  This movie is labeled as the next Indiana Jones, but if you grew up with the stories of Lucas and Spielberg, you will remember that they were action based.  There were moments of realization, but there was much more action involved.  I think more action incorporated into the National Treasure story would have helped it survive a bit longer than what it did.  I wanted to see some traps set forth by our founding fathers, some ancient guards, or anything that would have lifted the lifeless plot that surrounded this film.  My mother said that it just needed better bad guys, and I couldn't agree more.  There wasn't that fire in Bean's eyes that you were accustomed to seeing in the Indy films.  Nobody was tied up, nobody had a whip, and nobody was trying.  Bruckheimer, you literally need to stop.

Overall, I wasn't impressed with this Hollywood ""hit"".  While most will argue that they thought it was the most impressive film they have seen in a long time (words that I have heard time and time again), I just thought that it never went to the next level.  The clich acting hurt this film dearly, while the story just never reached up and grabbed me.  I never felt like Turtletaub (ummmmmm....Turtletaub) quite knew what he was getting himself into.  He needed a stronger balance between action and adventure, and needed to allow us to make our own decisions instead of forcing his thoughts into our face.  This film was a complete disrespect to our history, and I denounce it forever!

1526860,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is about a man played by Nicolas Cage whose ancestors have been searching for generations for a missing treasure that goes all the way back to George Washington & Tomas Jefferson, and the Decloration Of Independence.

After a lifetime searching for the treasure from the only remianing clue thats known, he finally finds what he was looking for, but discovers it's only the begining of the hunt. Especialy when members of his exploration team turn on him and go in search for the trasure themselves. Laws are broken, friendships ended and mayhem abrupts, but it's all just a fun ride to watch.

Forget what the critics say, they are just concerned with what movies they can tip for emmy nominations and don't care that nobody gives a $#!% about those blockbuster, over produced, over paid actor movies made espeicly for awards that people get shoved down there throat, never actualy like it, but there over promoted enough for every one to have heard of by the end of the 1st week.

National Treasure is no award winning movie, but thats a good thing, at least you can sit back and relax, kick the feet up and enjoy a film without boring dialog of some acadamey award winnnig speach. It's an action adventure film, and as you'd guess, there in search of lost treasure. It's suprising to know it's a Disney movie, but don't let that turn you away, it's ok for older kids, but it's not a little kids movie. It has interesting twists and turns, the plot is well concieved and it's enjoyable by anyone not more interested in whose wearing what to the A.A this year.

The DVD is packed with extras.

1526863,4,B00005JN5E,"The interesting thing about ""National Treasure"" is that it almost COULD be true.  There's as much evidence to say the Knights Templar took the Temple of Jerusalem treasures as not;  as much evidence that they took it to Europe as not;  even that it could have found its way to England.  How would it get to America?  I'm at a loss there...

I've seen a few reviewers complain that Cage's performance doesn't come close to Harrison Ford in ""Indiana Jones""... which I think is a bit unfair.  The Indiana Jones character was a seasoned man of action.  Cage's character is just a regular guy trying to untangle a family mystery.  Of course he's not going to be like Indiana Jones.

I thought the movie was interesting, although I find the whole Knights Templar/Freemasons thing to be interesting, so I'm biased.  There are certain points of the movie where the director was definitely reaching (the love scenes, if you can call them that, are always uncomfortable and seem pushed into the film) and some points reminded me of ""The Goonies"".

Overall though, I would recommend it as a fun movie to watch.  Don't expect a masterpiece and don't be too critical on the storyline (although I find those who think the whole Templar connection to bunk quite entertaining).",1116633600,4,1261,4.755760368663594

After stealing it (and finding the map) he goes on a treasure hunt to find this legendary treasure, while a group of evil thieves are on his trail (as is the FBI).

The action is mediocre and the story itself is cliched.  The fact that the movie is also PG hurts it because then it really is toned down.  Maybe if they went for a higher rating (PG-13 perhaps) than maybe it would be better.  This is a case where if it was taken more seriously, than maybe it would of been better.

1526937,4,B00005JN5E,"This is a very entertaining movie, and the extras bring this DVD up to 4 stars.  It is not a 5 star classic, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.  The story is not that great, the characters are fairly flat and there are too many lapses in logic.

This movie has a ridiculous premise, about the founding fathers, the secret treasure, and the clues to it hidden in National landmarks and documents.  But, so what.  This is an action/adventure movie meant for purely for entertainment and escapism.

The problem isn't the premise, the problem is in lapses in logic.  There are many things that just don't make sense.  Some of these include:

One of the clues in the treasure hunt is pointed at by a shadow from a spire at Independence Hall.  To see where that shadow is pointing, they must be there at exactly 2:20pm.  But, everyone knows that shadows move throughout the year.  There would only be one day out of the year where a shadow at 2:20pm would point to exactly the right place.

When the characters come to a cave, they pick up torches that have been lying around for 200 years, and they still work!

There is no depth to any of the characters in this movie.  They are all cardboard cutouts doing what is needed to keep the story moving.  Again, compate that to Raiders of the Lost Ark, where the characters have vibrant personalities and are multi-faceted.

Despite those issues, this is a well told story, with a good flow as the characters move from clue to clue.  It never drags or never gets boring.  There are few holes in the plot.  It is what summer blockbusters are all about.

1526939,4,B00005JN5E,"It seems like the main complaint that people have against National Treasure is that it's derivative of the best-selling Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.  Ok, I'll give you that.  But does that in and of itself make it a bad film?  How many films ARE totally original.  Taken on it's own merits National Treasure is a fun little treasure hunt film that really doesn't pretend to have aspirations of greatness.  Nick Cage, who I really like is Ben Gates, a historian/treasure hunter whose family has been maligned for decades for their search of the hidden treasure of the Templar Knights/Freemasons.  Now the legend of the Templar treasure is one rooted in real life which many treasure hunters have been looking for for centuries.  A bit more background on the Templars would have been nice but as history tells us, they were the world's first bankers and grew to incredible power...too powerful in fact for the church as Pope Clement accused them of heresy and they were hunted down, killed or imprisoned, and their treasures taken.  But it's been legend that many escaped and the Templars eventually formed the Freemasons and made their way to America, with much treasure still in hand.

Anyway Gates and his sidekick Riley are betrayed by a fellow treasure hunter Ian (played by Lord of the Rings Sean Bean) and then its a race to see who can steal the Declaration of Independence first to use the hidden map on the back of that rare document.  Abigail Chase, a professor at the National Archives is caught up in the chase with Gates when he pulls off the elaborate and highly unprobable theft of the document with Ian and his cronies not far behind.  What follows is a DaVinci Code-esque whirlwind of clues and revelations as the trio go from spot to spot finding the next clues.  They eventually find their way to the home of Ben's father Patrick Gates played by Jon Voight who has always thought the search for the treasure was folly.

Treasure builds and builds the curiousity and suspense in the race for the treasure and the one real weakness of the over two hour film is that it all wraps up nice and tidy within about ten minutes making the viewer feeling a bit unfulfilled.  yes it's pretty all improbable, especially the theft of the Declaration of Independence but if you suspend disbelief you can take it in as a fun little diversion.  Harvey Keitel is also on hand as an FBI agent who just happens to be a Freemason.

The DVd extras are pretty light.  There's a very short alternate ending, some deleted scenes and a making of featurette.  Nothing to write home about.  Don't compare it to the Da Vinci Code.  Just have fun.",1116288000,3,2635,4.625806451612903

Benjamin Gates(middle name's Franklin, what writing ingenuity!) is part of a long line of family treasure hunters. Well they prefer treasure preservers or protectors. They're after the find and the historical aspect rather than the fame/money part. There's a legend of the treasure of the Knights Templar, said to be massive and containing many treasures that could be worth millions.

His quest leads him to snow buried ship the Charlotte which was a clue by one of the people who knew about it: ""the answer lies with Charlotte"".  In it he finds a pipe which has an inscription and with some quick thinking(bit too quick personally) he uncovers another clue: the treasures location rests with the Declaration of Independence, or rather the back of it in invisible ink. Only 2 of his hunting partners turn on him and are after the money only and would even burn or just chuck the document rather than preserve it.

Which is of course heavily protected in a government building with anti-personnel security systems reminiscent of Mission: Impossible. After some sleuthing and high tech gadgetry, they manage to steal the document. And from then on, there's clues piled on clues including glasses that has a neat effect attached to them.

Joining him is Abigail Chase played by hottie-but-somewhat-bland Diane Kruger from Troy and some guy who's name escapes me right now(sorry, guy) but he plays the obligatory comic relief. And Harvey Kietel is hunting after all 3 of them and wanting to put them in jail. And as usual, Sean Bean provides another great villain.

The film's interest mainly comes from all the neat stuff the freemasons did to hide their treasure but provide enough clues like a shadow falling across a certain place of Independence Hall. Or the aforementioned glasses which can read a paper in different ways.

I won't repeat what others have said, or blab away the plot; I will reiterate that Nicholas Cage takes command and is a very endearing character. Jon Voight is particularly good in a very subdued performance and it's always good to see Harvey Keitel. My absolute favorite element of this film is the side-kick character of Riley, a terrific performance by Justin Bartha. I want to see more of him. I enjoyed the intriguing sets, and I didn't think the script or direction were sub-par at all. I was entertained, and that, to me, is what movies are all about. Too bad that so many people analyzed everything with such closed minds. missing out on all the fun that was going on. The DVD has lots of fun extras. I'm happy to own it.

1527097,5,B00005JN5E,"I'll vote with Grandpa Stout that this action film is one for the entire family.

The story begins with a grandfather telling his grandson of a family mystery. Nicholas Cage delivers as the grown boy playing out his grandfather's dream, in a role that one might expect of Harrison Ford. And while the general outlines of the plot are predictable, the fun is in the details and special effects.

How many people would expect to find a national treasure consisting of bounty galore from ancient civilizations by the dozen? No one with half a brain would accept the fictional notion here as real, much less the place these characters actually hit the jackpot. Still, the acting and characters are believable, as is the idea of following one's dreams. It's another Indiana Jones, without the violence.

If you want an action-packed movie that is great for kids from five to 95, this feature length film provides the ticket.

On the other hand, it isn't a good movie, either.  It's the sort of mind-numbing, high-concept Hollywood adventure flick Bruckheimer is known for, and if you're into his other movies, you'll probably like this one, too.

I didn't so much mind the implausibility of the basic scenario; I went into the movie expecting it.  What was far more bothersome was that characters act in a manner that, well, believeable characters never would--and even flash-and-bang Hollywood adventure blockbusters need believeable characters.  Would the FBI REALLY let run loose the guy who stole the Declaration of Independence, even if it was to catch other bad guys?  Would they REALLY not surround them the FIRST chance they got?  Hardly.  Would the bad guys REALLY hand over vital ""stuff"" to the hero?  Uh--no.  And this isn't even to mention the silly ease with which they managed to steal the Declaration in the first place.

It's hard not to like something about a treasure-hunt movie that involves Knights Templar, Freemasons, and old blueblood families long fallen into dishonor.

Everyone told me that I'd like this as long as I ignored the plot holes.  But they were two big to ignore.  I thought maybe the treasure was down in one of them.

I dig two inches into ice and find a boat (lucky me).  But the inside of the boat has not been filled with water and then frozen.  Hm....

Okay, that's a minor detail, as is this.  Nicholas Cage carrying the Declaration of Independence around in a bullet-proof glass case.  I could be wrong, but wouldn't it be a little bit heavy?

Okay, okay, so he's told this woman that someone is going to steal the Declaration.  Then he sees her at the party.  He offers a very cryptic toast.  I think she'd probably put 2 and 2 together and say, ""Security, arrest this man.""

The bad guys always know where to go and what they need despite not having ANY of the clues they'd need.  Why could they do this?  They had ""unlimited resources.""  In other words, the writer needed them to be able to do whatever they want, but couldn't be bothered with trying to figure out how that would be possible.

Okay, my favorite one...they have to be in the bell tower at just the right time to see the shadow pointing to the right spot on the wall.  But the shadow would only be pointing there twice a year!  What if they went on the wrong day!  If they went in the winter, the shadow would be to the left of the right place, and if they went in the summer, it would be pointing too far to the right!  (Raiders of the Lost Ark has a similar problem, but it is fairly easily and mostly satisfyingly solved by having the sun shine through a little hole.)

1527213,3,B00005JN5E,"""National Treasure"" is a big, dumb, amiable dog of a movie. If you like big, dumb, amiable dogs, you'll love it. If you don't, forget it. The plot is outrageously implausible and the acting is cartoonish, but, like that dumb dog, it only aims to please. It's no ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but, as mindless entertainment goes, it has its moments.

Ben Gates [Nicholas Cage] is a descendant of a family which learned a secret 200 years ago. According to the story, our founding fathers, which included several Free Masons, stashed away a treasure worth billions and billions of today's dollars. Ben follows an elaborate set of clues left by said founding fathers. When he discovers a truly important one, his benefactor turns on him because he wants the treasure for himself. Realizing his old partner will use any means necessary, Ben decides to fight fire with fire. This includes stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives in Washington, DC because there may be a map for  locating the treasure hidden on the back of the sacred document.

Car chases and shoot outs follow as Ben and his nemesis look for the treasure.

If you forget logic and reason, ""National Treasure"" can be quite entertaining. Frankly, if anything bothered me about the movie, it was watching once vaunted actors Cage and Jon Voight, who plays his Dad, reduced once again to collecting a fat paycheck.",1115596800,2,1428,4.864197530864198
1527214,4,B00005JN5E,"I spend a lot of time arguing online and thinking about how literature presents truth and why we only believe historically and scientifically accurate accounts to be true, anything else is labelled and discarded intellectually as fiction. So please forgive me if i see this theme dominating the movie as well, you know the saying: to a man whose only tool is a hammer, all problems are nails.

The movie is good, compelling, engrossing, absorbing, a good way to spend 2 hours out of the afternoon heat.

It is this link between the artist and his audience, what is believable and persuadable to us that i find useful in the move after leaving the theatre. Is there this enormous wealth hidden under the graveyard just off Wall Street? of course not, but how the author persuades us to believe that it just might be true is marvelous. He does so by realistically giving us enough facts that we find truthful that we jump over the connections to the next set and joyfully embrace the artist's vision, despite it's blatant foolishness. There is enough truth that we suspend disbelief for the important steps, for the awkward things that we would never embrace if presented by themselves. We find the package believable because we recognize the wrapping, in our eagerness to unwrap an adventure and a stimulating chase, we jump to normally unwarranted conclusions.

For example, i watched ""Sky Captain"" this week. It's mixture of historical and mythical put the whole movie into the comic book genre, fun but unpersuasive. Now are the Masons the descendents of the Knights Templar? Possibly, there has been a rash of books proposing just that for 20 years, but they all are panned and dismissed by the critics. Perhaps the same critics that find this a believable and fun movie, despite the fact that it makes much more unbelievable claims then does _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_. But it does so by leading into the weaknesses of our cultural epistemology not by confronting it directly. This is the secret of such movie successes and the reason for the failure of the literature genre that HB,HG represents. People want to believe the bizzare, the Xfiles garbage, they only want it packaged in historical and scientific wrapping. For it is the wrapping, not the contents that interest most people. They really aren't interested in the science or underlying reasons, they only want the illusion to cover up their itching ears and wandering eyes. We desire to be deceived and seduced, we just don't want to let other people know it and cover it with the legitimatizer of the day-science.

We love racing and outthinking the competition- see the ""Amazing Race"". We love gadgets and trinkets, toys and things that glitter. But we want to justify these desires by claiming that they are both useful (pragmatic and utilitarian) and good (moral and uplifting). By tying these things together the authors etc of NT both involve us and excuse our weaknesses, justifying our entracement while excusing the fact that we justify the unbelievable by making it look like history. This is the magic of the historical novel, unlike the comic book or the fantasy like Shriek, we can be persuaded that it just might have happened. That it is believable because the package conforms to our societal notions of truthfulness as outlined by science and historical research.

It is the Xfiles phenomena, we unrighteously suspend disbelief because the authors have given us a package wrapped in our favorite and most persuasive stories.

It is Kipling's just so stories updated to the greed of the 21st century with the amazing race thrown in since we love a winner.

On top of all that it also presents history in an entertaining light.  Rather than just names and dates, it shows that history is filled with STORIES - exciting stories, intriguing stories, and very entertaining stories.  It's the perfect movie to show your kids before they go into High School.  It's also a flat-out entertaining ride of a movie that will appeal to adults as well.

For the generations that grew up on James Bond and Indiana Jones National Treasure is a welcomed movie.  It is not a kids movie - it's just a movie that kids over 7 or 8 can watch.  While you may have to suspend disbelief at some of the details in the movie, that isn't very hard to do (no more so than in any of the aforementioned James Bond or Indiana Jones movies).  The story is told at such a pace, and with such flair that most moviegoers (or DVD watchers) won't have either the time or the inclination to try to tear the movie apart detail by detail - that job is left to the critics whose snobbery often gets in the way of just enjoying a fun ride of a movie.  For the rest of us National Treasure is pure entertainment.

Nicolas Cage is great as Ben Gates, and the supporting cast is very good as well (Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Sean Bean - he's always good, and even Christopher Plummer in a bit part as Ben's grandfather).

This is a movie that proves that it is still possible to make a movie that appeals to adults while still being acceptable to parents as a movie for their kids to watch.

A HINT ABOUT THE MENU: Finding all of the extras on the disc is a treasure hunt unto itself.  In the MAIN menu, highlight the book on the top right. A hidden page will appear with numbers on the left & options on the right.  On the left select these numbers in this order: 4, 0, 5.  Then on the right select ""Submit Master Code"" and hit the enter button.  You will now get a complete listing of all of the extras.
Another way to get to the hidden extras not on the regular extras menu is to follow the above directions, but select the numbers in this order: 3, 9, 7.  Then on the right select ""Submit Secret Code"".  This time only the hidden extras will show up.

There are some flaws with the story.
1) During the treasure hunt, one of the clues is to be found in a shadow created at a certain time of day.  But the message does not say what time of year this would happen.  Since the sun is in a different position through out the year, the shadow would be created in different areas.  With all of the attention to details, I am surprised this was overlooked.

2) The moral: Stealing is O.K. if you feel it is for a good purpose. And you can get away with it if there is someone else trying to steal your stolen goods.

It is also a little unbelievable that the first clue is deciphered to say the map is on the back of the Declaration Of Independence.  The way they got to this conclusion is far fetched and members of the gang should have doubted this.  I guess that would have only slowed down the story and the director wanted to get it going.

But you put the two of them together in a big action/adventure and you definitley know what you'll be seeing. Having previously paired up for the high octane action flicks like ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"", Cage and Bruckheimer deliver films that are nothing but big buckets of greasy popcorn with a heap of fun on top. That's what this movie delivers. Good, old fashioned fun in the ""Indiana Jones"" variety. Directed by Jon Turteltaub, the movie is a rollicking fun ride through our nation's history, and traveling in, around, and sometimes beneath, historic places of the land. Nic Cage stars as Ben Gates, Benjaim Franklin Gates, a treasure hunter. Thru flashbacks in the beginning with his grandfather(Christopher Plummer)when he was younger, Ben has been on the search of elusive treasure. The Treasure of the Knights of Templar, kept hidden from freemasons then and now. He comes to believe can be found with the help of an invisible map that he believes is on the back of the declaration of independence. The famed document of which he has to steal(before others do). With the help of his sidekick Riley(Justin Bertha), and Abigail Chase(Diane Kruger), Ben and Co. are off on an incredible journey to find the treasure. But all is not well when he and his cohorts have another gang hot on their heels to find the treasure themselves. While the movie may not aiming for incredible, long lasting credibility, it does achieve a very important things for movies of this nature that make it a success. It's fun. It's entertaining. It's funny. It has a fun cast. It looks good and just delivers all the popcorn thrills one would come to expect. Naysayers might complain of how ""out there"" the plot is, but does it matter?. It's a movie. Not real life. It set out to be what it is, and it succeeded. How could anyone not like a fun adventure filled with snow covered ships, daring robberies, hidden tunnels, crypts, skeletons, and tresure?. Cage has always been one of the most dynamic and watchable performers, and he comes to the role of Ben Gates with the right kind of appeal and makes it better than it is. Jon Voight also co-stars as his father, Patrick Gates, an ex-treasure hunter who believes he wasted his life looking for nothing. Sean Bean has made a career out of playing criminals of some kind, and here's another one to add to the list. But he does do it well. Kruger is an appealing and beautiful heroine along for the ride, but it feels like her character is just for another damsel in distress. Bartha is the main comic relief. He has the best lines and the parts that will have the audience laughing the most. And then there is Harvey Keitel, as an FBI agent on the trail of Gates and crew. There seems to be a lot of love for this movie by other reviews here, and it's nice to see that. Nice to see that movies that are incredibly fun, entertaining, and just down right enjoyable, like this one, are seen for what they are. A good time. Not like some critics who cut it down for it's ""ridiculous plot"" and all the mumbo jumbo that comes with it. Again, a lot of them don't see what it's really here for. Filled with a decent enough script that holds the film and clues together good enough, eye catching direction from Turteltaub, and cool fun, National Treasure is a clean and fun thrill ride for everyone.",1115424000,2,3492,4.579872204472843

1527297,4,B00005JN5E,"Like a trip to Disneyland, this family geared caper is cute and filled with gratuitous fluff like the opening Artic scenes where the story really takes off, but given the premise that this is pretty sterilized stuff the end result is a surprisingly entertaining little movie.  Like getting an E ride for the price of an A ticket.

The simple plot of a centuries old secret about a treasure map whose clues are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence has been in the family of Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) from the beginning, according to the pre-title sequence where young Ben's father (Christopher Plummer) initiates Ben's life long passion to discover what his ancestors couldn't.  Ben's partner Riley (Justin Bartha - remember him in 'Gigli'?) and eventually the beautiful Abigal Chase (Diane Kruger) slowly decode the secret with Ben, all the while being chased by former partners Ian (Sean Bean) et al and the FBI (Harvey Keitel). The caper is well written and entertainingly fast paced and if the ending is far too predictable, just take a deep breath and remember this is a Disney epic.

Cage, Bartha, and Kruger make a terrific team and watching them make the best of this silly caper is proof of their talents.  If you are searching for an edge-of-the-seat heist/terror film, look elsewhere, but if a solid evening's entertainment is your goal, settle back and enjoy.

1527299,2,B00005JN5E,"Treasure hunting is an intriguing notion often connected with suspense and adventure when viewed on film.  National Treasure is such a film, which intends to trigger suspense while providing a fantastic adventure through the mysterious freemasons, history, and the founding fathers.  The audience which sits down to enjoy this venture undertaken by Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his partner Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) will unfortunately have placed it's foot in the wrong adventure, as this concoction will neither be suspenseful nor adventurous.  Instead, the viewer will go through a repetitive journey of clue solving where the story's hero seems to be a know-it-all, whereas previous generations seem to have been struggling through their lifetime with what he finds to be simple.

When Ben was a young teen, he heard from his grandfather (Christopher Plummer) about a fantastic adventure regarding a hidden treasure uncovered by some knights during the crusades.  This treasure was deemed too vast and rich for any king, or person, which caused people to hide it in the first place.  When the Templar Knights found it under the Temple of Solomon, they swore to hide and protect the treasure.  The knights brought the treasure to Europe, and later to the New World.  This brief introduction to the treasure serves the purpose of explaining Ben's obsession with the treasure, but it is also the best part of the film that regrettably dwindles hereafter.

For the rest of the film the audience gets to follow the camera while it moves with Ben who travels between different historical sites on the quest for another clue of the treasures whereabouts.  This turns into a rather tiresome event, as the story seems to cover it up with grand larceny and mean thugs that are not so mean.  Additional awkwardness generates from the lack of suspense, as everything, even the difficult parts of the film, seem to move smoothly.  The film also provides a sense of comfort and ease, which does not belong in the atmosphere with lethal crooks and the FBI breathing down their necks.

The director Jon Turteltaub's creation is a cheesy adventure film that fails to compare to many other treasure hunt films such as It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), Goonies (1985), and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003).  Some level of cheesiness is to be expected, but National Treasure does not try to venture in that direction intentionally and instead leaves the viewers feeling somewhat cheated in the end.  This is mostly  because the protagonist in the film knows it all, and delivers methodically an answer to all questions.  The roller coaster that the film offers is without the steep hills that parents safely can send their children through while most children will enjoy this film before they learn that film can be so much more.",1115251200,3,2847,4.972573839662447
1527300,5,B00005JN5E,"Benjamin Franklin Gates is the latest in a long line of treasure hunters.  The Gates family has been searching for a treasure hidden by the founders of the United States since the last founder told one of them the first clue many years ago.  There's just one difference.  Ben has solved the first riddle and that leads him to believe the next clue is on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  When his financiers decided to steal the document, Ben realizes he's on his own to find the treasure and keep America's historical document safe.  But in a race again time, will Ben and his friends win?

Ok, so maybe this movie isn't great cinema or the best movie ever made.  It really doesn't matter, and you know why?  Because the movie is fun.  I had a smile on my face from start to finish and was often on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next.  Yes, I'm annoyed that we never found out how Ben tracked down the first clue.  And there's at least one plot hole that will jump off the screen at you.  But in the end, I didn't care.  The story engaged me, and the characters were fun.  I found their banter very entertaining.  Plus setting the story around so much American history certainly didn't hurt this US history buff.

The DVD could have been better done.  The widescreen and surround sound are wonderful.  It's the extras where I have my problem.  There is a treasure hunt motif to them, with at least two different levels.  The booklet does provide clues to get to the second layer, but I keep hearing rumors of a final level, and that's very annoying.  What is easily found is nice.  There are two deleted scenes and an alternate ending, each with an optional commentary.  We get a brief behind the filming documentary and an animated early version of the opening story to give the director an idea how it was supposed to look.  Layer two brings an encryption game and two brief documentaries on real life treasure hunters (interesting) and the Knights Templar (mostly useless.)  Noticeably missing, at least in the obvious parts of the disc, are such standard features as an audio commentary and the original trailers.

This movie is exactly what it sets out to be, a fun escape.  If looked at that way, you'll be entertained.",1115251200,16,2257,4.522277227722772

Many of the best supplimental features on the disk are hidden and the viewer has to solve puzzels, try for easter eggs and other nonsense to get to them. This feature makes a viewer want to throw the disk against the wall or break it in pieces. When I want to see the special features that I have paid for when I buy the disk, I don't want to spend time playing games. This is OK for kids on the childrens releases, but not for an adult film. If you love puzzles, crosswords, translating hyrogliphics and such things, this disk might appeal to you, but it is simply frustrating for many people.

1527362,5,B00005JN5E,"As noted in many reviews, NATIONAL TREASURE is one of those old-fashioned, non-violent, profanity-free adventure movies they don't make anymore.  And for that, NATIONAL TREASURE is a treasure find for families to enjoy together without worrying about excess violence, profanity or nudity.  As a movie, it's a ridiculously implausible plot, but it's also very engaging, well-written and involving.  The clues are presented in logical fashion and we find ourselves wondering exactly where the clues will lead us.  Nicolas Cage offers a sincere and heroic leading man persona and Diane Kruger is lovely and smart as the cryptographer who finds herself inadvertently along for the ride.  Justin Bartha as Riley, the sidekick is lots of fun to watch; he brings a joyous innocence and naivete to his role and obviously a lot of respect for his mentor.  Sean Bean is callously villainous as the rival for the Declaration, and Jon Voight is appropriately crusty as Cage's disbelieving father.  Add Christopher Plummer in a small cameo as Cage's grandfather and you have a cast up to the challenge.

NATIONAL TREASURE is as fun, Indiana Jones like movie, and I wouldn't mind if they made a sequel.  It's nice to watch an entertaining movie that doesn't rely on the usual ingredients of most of today's action films.  Enjoy!",1115251200,3,1314,5.069767441860465
1527363,4,B00005JN5E,"Nicolas Cage has run the gamut of the action film genre. He's played the reluctant action hero in The Rock, a cartoonish icon in Con Air and the amoral bad guy in Face/Off. With National Treasure he essays a new variation-the non-violent action hero. Usually, you don't see anything of the non-violent kind in a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie and that's one of several pleasant surprises in this movie.

At times, National Treasure wants to be a contemporary update of Indiana Jones. Like that character, Benjamin Gates isn't in it for the money but for a genuine love of history and the thrill of the solving the centuries old mystery.  This is a surprisingly entertaining mix of action and humour. It doesn't rely on too many cliches of the genre and tries not to insult one's intelligence.

In keeping with the cracking codes and knowing something about history from the movie, each extra contains a clue at the end of it that when put together will unlock another level of supplemental materials and then another.

""National Treasure on Location"" briefly touches upon the film's origins. It started with a premise: what if you stole the Declaration of Independence? It is quite an achievement that the filmmakers got to shoot on location at these famous historical landmarks. Only a Bruckheimer production would have the clout (and money) to achieve this.

There are two deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Jon Turteltaub that provide a little more back-story to Gates' ancestor. The filmmaker mentions that the original cut was four hours long and yet we are only given two scenes, one of which is just an extension of an existing one.

Also included is an ""Opening Scene Animatic"" with optional commentary by Turteltaub that shows a rough, computer animated storyboard of the opening historical prologue.

There is also an ""Alternate Ending"" with optional commentary by Turteltaub that originally tried to set-up a sequel but this wasn't their intention and so, thankfully, it was scrapped.

""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" takes a look at the real people who look for treasure. The ones who are interviewed for this extra claim that they are in it for a love of history, but many of them look pretty well off so it becomes obvious that we are only touching the surface here.

""Riley Poole's Decode This!"" is a game that teaches a little about hieroglyphics and cryptography and then has you decode a bunch of names that get progressively harder (although, not that much).

""The Templar Knights"" featurette briefly examines these historical figures and their link to the Free Masons.

Finally, there is a bonus ""Trivia Track"" which allows you to watch the movie with a subtitle track that dispenses mostly useless info that you could easily get from surfing the Internet Movie Database.",1115251200,,2804,4.97008547008547

Although the plot line is absurd, it had a lot of historical Americana through it. The facts that are known of the Masons and founding fathers of this country were mixed together with little fantasy made this file believable along with the acting. 4 *** s",1115251200,2,538,4.444444444444445

It makes a great adventure story if you can ignore some of the plot holes and outrageous antics of the characters.  I found the treasure hunt to be very entertaining.  Watching Gates (played by Cage) try to stay one step ahead of both the bad guys and the FBI added some suspense to the movie.

As for the DVD, they gave it quite a few extra features, considering that they packed it all one one disk.  Like the movie, the disk is a treasure hunt.  As you watch the special features, you are given clues which allow you to unlock even more features.  It of course is not the first DVD to do this, but I thought it did mesh quite well with the theme of the movie.  One thing I that was lacking was a complete commentary track.  They had a directors commentary for the deleted scenes and alternate ending (which I that was by far inferior to the real ending) but they don't have a commentary track for the entire movie.  Perhaps that would have forced them to bump the other special features to a second disk.  Perhaps if the movie does as well on DVD as it did in the theaters, there will be a ""special edition"" released at some point with a complete commentary, and a few more features on a second disk.",1115164800,2,1284,4.242798353909465

The best part for me was the musical score--it begins with a grand sweep, and as the movie goes along, becomes more intense and thoughtful. Kind of the opposite of what I'm used to. A different approach and one that really sold the movie for me.",1115164800,2,461,4.310344827586207
1527367,4,B00005JN5E,"I go to the movies rarely any longer, and this is not the type of film that would have been a ""must see"" for me. The DVD was received as a gift, and I watched it to simply be polite...and am glad I did!

As many others have pointed out, the entire film is improbable...a search for a treasure that has been hidden since colonial times, with impossibly vague clues scattered about.

But, enter Nicholas Cage...whose character in this film is engaging, witty, and the smartest individual to grace a media screen since Adam West and Burt Ward solved all of The Riddler's impossibly vague clues with relative ease. Sure, he gets stumped from time to time in the quest for such an elusive treasure...but never for long...and you absolutely ***know*** that he will somehow triumph before the movie reaches its conclusion.

Clocking in at a little over two hours, ""National Treasure"" seemed much shorter...because the pace of the film rarely lets up. From the opening scenes, anyone willing to suspend belief and simply enjoy the ride is treated to one action-filled, highly improbable moment after the next. Split-second decisions and impeccable timing rescue Cage's character from certain death/failure on so many occasions that they would be impossible to list here...but it's done so well, and with so much style and humor, that I found it difficult to not be entertained.

Better still, it's a movie that parents can enjoy with their kids. Language throughout is commendably clean, and unlike many so-called ""family"" films, there isn't a single gag involving bodily functions...Dear God, does this mean the world is coming to an end? : )

Check reality at the doorstep, pop in the DVD, and settle back for a good time. If this movie inspires a sequel, I'll be at the theater to see it.",1115164800,8,1783,4.832786885245902
1527368,2,B00005JN5E,"Some like to say that if the critics hate it, then it must be good. Well, I often say that if the masses love it, then it must be bad. The truth is probably somewhere in between.

National Treasure starts off with great potential: Masonic underpinnings to the country, secret codes that reveal mysteries, and a treasure to be found, oh boy! The problems kick in with the hokey dialogue (Harvey Keitel proves that award winners can really be lame in a film and often take anything for money). He actually says something like, ""This is not a good day for ummmm.""

Nick Cage can be really funny in action films like Con Air where his over-the-top performance is welcome. But in a film like this, where the viewer wants to take the story seriously, Cage comes across as a joke. Often he seems on the verge of laughter, or joy, perhaps at the obscene amount of money he makes just for showing up and being appealing. The geeky sidekick is reminiscent of the geek in Twister and the geeks ad infinitum that are an integral and oft annoying piece of the big budget action formulae. The public just giggles and giggles at all the high tech speak and dorky behavior. Look at Alias! The action scenes are quite silly (take the one with the blonde swinging from the door of the van). When the same blonde so easily caves into the plot of heisting the DOI after appearing to be the ethical one, I was amazed at how unbelievable this film was.

At times the story is intriguing and the characters are amusing but these times are overshadowed by the overall sensationalistic Die-Hard meets Independence Day qualities (is anyone else sick of Jerry Bruckheimer's perpetually dumbed down style?)

The dialogue mostly caters to the lowest common denominator (the masses), when it's not speaking over their heads, and is worthy of the critics' wrath. The Masonic/Knights Templar stuff is exciting and worthy of a film leagues beyond this one. I recommend that you put down the Dan Brown books, quit renting or buying sensational films like this and go find any book by Robert Anton Wilson to really stretch your mind on secret societies.

The premise of this film would have been much better served by a Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, or Ken Russell. David Mamet could have done a more stimulating version while sleep-walking.

You've been ""kissed by the vampire"" on this one.",1115164800,11,2358,4.683574879227053
1527369,4,B00005JN5E,"Here is your first clue:  ""National Treasure"" is to ""(fill in the blank)"" as ""Jezebel"" is to ""Gone With the Wind.""
While the millions of book readers wondering who was going to play Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) in Ron Howard's next movie did not approach the passionate debate over who should play Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, there is no doubt that ""National Treasure"" is an attempt to capitalize on the great interest in a best-selling novel about unraveling arcane clues left by famous people in the same way that ""Jezebel"" got to the silver screen with a movie about the ante-bellum South before ""GWTW.""  The question is whether ""National Treasure"" is just an appetizer to whet our appetite for next year's version of Dan Brown's novel or if this will turn our stomach to the whole idea of films where only the hero can decipher the clues and solve the mystery.
The key is not to take this film seriously because it does not.  After all, there is not a secret society that is dodging the steps of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage), but a villain, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who wants the treasure because it is worth billions of dollars.  Yes, there is a pretty blonde with a foreign accent (Diane Kruger) to provide informative, help and a love interest for the hero, but there is also a nerd (Justin Bartha) for comic relief and hard science.  Ultimately, ""National Treasure"" is more like an adventure computer game, where you around a collect strange objects and visit interesting places while solving puzzles that eventually get you to whatever you are looking for, which suggests that a younger audience that does not often get away from their computer screens long enough to read an actual novel will enjoy this film more.
Gates is the latest in a line of family members named for the Founding Fathers and committed to the search for a fabled ancient treasure originally discovered under King Solomon's Temple moved from Jerusalem by the Knights Templar and brought by Free Masons to the New World where it was secreted away by those same Founding Fathers.  Having discovered the meaning of the first clue given to him by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer), Ben Gates figures that the next is found on the back of the Declaration of Independence, written in invisible ink.  Gates knows this, Howe knows this, and the race is on to beg, borrow or steal the most important piece of parchment in the United States and figure out the next clue in the puzzle.
On the plus side the film can be seen, as one kid observes in the alternative ending, as an attempt to make the viewers learn something about American history, which is a laudable if secondary goal in and of itself.  But basically this is a caper film, which means you do not have to try and figure out the clues because the screenplay gives Gates just enough time to figure it out while the rest of us try to follow along.  Otherwise, what this 2004 film from director Jon Turteltaub (""Phenomenon,"" ""Instinct"") says to us is that the Founding Fathers must not have cared as much about establishing a new nation if they sat on all that money instead of using it to buy weapons to gain independence or pay the soldiers in the Continental Army who were freezing to death at Valley Forge.  Of course, then there would be no treasure to hunt in this movie.
They always said that if Ben Franklin had written the Declaration of Independence rather than Thomas Jefferson he would have put a joke in it, so perhaps it is not surprising that he is the merry prankster behind a lot of the code breaking and puzzle solving in this film.  Fortunately the codes and puzzles on the DVD special features that get you to bonus sections and the trivia track for the film are a lot easier to solve.  Why the treasure is lost makes no sense since the colonists did win the American Revolution and the signers of the Declaration were not slaughtered like the Knights Templar.  So the desperate situation told reached in the story Gates is told by his grandfather would not have been reached.  Of course, that would take the wind out of this movie and we just cannot have that.  Instead we move along so that we get to the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" big finale.  ""National Treasure"" is not anywhere near that good of a ride, but it is solid escapist fare with touches of American history.
At least this film will not inspire anyone to wonder if the story is true and we will be spared dozens of books arguing out the fact and fiction of the tale.  Then again, the Declaration of Independence DOES have a back...",1115164800,,4593,4.602203182374541

I submit a third certainty to this list: if the critics hate it, without a doubt I am going to LOVE IT.  Why?  I'm not quite certain, but it just seems to be the case virtually ALL the time (at least with me anyway).

First off, National Treasure probably would not have been made if not for the phenomenal success of The Da Vinci Code.  The similarities are too close to be a coincidence.  The success of BOTH however is NO accident.  It is rare that I go to the movies looking for an opportunity to increase my intellect.  I generally go to have FUN and escape from the real world for a while, same reason why I take my family to Disneyland, I just hope to escape and enjoy myself.  I have no doubt in my mind if The Da Vinci Code had not have been printed, this movie would simply not exist...I suppose I could be wrong, but I'm willing to wager I'm not.  Either way, WHO CARES?  For all the same reasons why Dan Brown's novel is so entertaining, National Treasure places that energy and love of history onto the big screen and for the most part, the payoff is well worth it.

FORGET how plausible the film is.  When was the last time you saw a Hollywood blockbuster movie and came away believing ANY of it?  This film was meant for entertainment, pure and simple.  For those who cannot enjoy anything without dissecting every scene and annoyingly break it apart frame by frame, well this movie was definitely NOT made for them.  There is a great portion of this movie which is simply impossible to believe, yet the vast majority of those who saw this movie enjoyed it anyway because the Producers seemed to catch the vision of what the movie was all about and set out to simply have some genuine fun along the way, and the results?  Well the results tend to be a tremendously popular film which earns a boatload of money and screams for a sequel.  Part of me would LOVE one, but I also have to remind myself just how often Hollywood literally ruins sequels.  Maybe I'd rather just enjoy the one unless they can at the very least do another one AS good as the original...but I'm not going to hold my breath.

Let me also say that despite the fact that I have enjoyed many films with Nicolas Cage, I have never really enjoyed him in particular and kind of always felt he was viewed as being a lot better than he really was -- at least to me...but I must admit this movie really changed my mind, much like how Ghost made me appreciate Whoopie Goldberg after disliking literally everything she had made up to that point.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie was perfectly cast, but they certainly did a good job.  The storyline and the pacing were done virtually to perfection and the added DVD bonuses actually ARE quite interesting and unlike so many so-called *extras* you see on these discs, this one actually has a couple of VERY cool items which are quite informative and entertaining at the same time.  It is tough these days to single a movie out amidst all of the riff-raff hitting the video-store shelves these days, but National Treasure will work its way to the front simply because when you get right down to it, most of us really enjoy a fun and entertaining thrill ride which makes us feel good along the way.

The last few years with ""Pirates of the Carribean"", ""Holes"", and ""Princess of Thieves"" I am developing a real respect for Disney again. Perhaps they realized somebody needed to make family movies like they did so many years ago. This movie was just plain light fun for the whole family. My wife and I loved it and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD. I ran out today and got it. Nicholas Cage and Diane Kruger are great along with the wonderful support cast. Any fans of the Indiana Jones movies should enjoy it. It is like a modern version of one of the Harrison Ford movies.

Plenty of action and excellent camera work make it a must for fans of the genre. The musical score is compelling and adds to the suspense. One of the things I truly enjoy about the movie is that it revolves around true historical events and it takes you to historical places. Does it have some implausibility, sure, but that won't stop you being glued to your seat for the whole movie. As we follow Cage from childhood in searh of a hidden Masonic treasure of great wealth we are tantalized with clues that take us to the next step. Jon Voight is great as the skeptical father, and Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the grandfather that believes in the stories of the Masonic treasure. Did you know Christopher Plummer acted in another interesting Masonic story, ""The Man Who Would Be King""?

The DVD has lots of extras like a documentary, commentary, deleted scenes, and alternate ending. It even has Cryptography puzzles and letter and number clues that will allow you to open the Trivia version of the movie. The picture and sound are excellent.

1527416,4,B00005JN5E,"What's with all the critical carping about Da Vinci Code meets Indiana Jones? After all, who did Dan Brown crib from, to say nothing of the Lucas-Spielberg boys. Basic plots and conundrums go back as far as unrecorded history / storytelling. The real points are elsewhere, not in the vehicle (which is only a conveyance, after all).

Here's a nice adventure yarn which wears its cinematic/literary influences one way or the other depending on your personal taste and preference. I took it as a well done, tongue-in-cheek if not particularly deep bit of popcorn entertainment.

Yes, the music is overcooked John Williams. Yes, the historical elements are skewed, to say the least, when they aren't outright inaccurate. Read Walter Isaacson's wonderful biography of Benjamin Franklin, and also his companion volume of Franklin's writings - including the infamous Silence Dogood letters, and you'll see just how easy it is to take a few facts, turn them inside out, and then come up with a thoroughly preposterous tale. Franklin, by the way, was sixteen years old when he wrote these pieces as part of his early adventures in the printing business to which he was then apprenticed.

But, then again, how many people who don't live in Philadelphia understand anything about either the city's revolutionary period history, or of its most famous citizen?

Just enjoy the film for the fluff it is - then go and do your homework. You're bound to wind up learning more about American history than you know at present - and that's worth it by itself.",1115078400,2,1540,4.934362934362935

Everything else causes my head to ache in embarrassment. Thank god he didn't land the role of Superman. He CAN pull off dark, tough characters.

Well, don't let this fool you. This movie is excellent. It proves that you don't need gratuitous violence, language and sex to make a movie exciting with adventure and action. Kudos to Walt Disney for bringing us an excellent movie that you can take your kids to see.

The action moves at a brisk pace, never letting you catch your breath. The action is excellent and well executed and the acting and story are fabulous. The basic premise is that a group of men called the Masons were tasked with keeping vast amounts of treasure (now over 2,000 years old) out of the hands of people who would abuse it. The location of the treasure is unknown, but the Mason's have apparently left clues (such as the all-seeing eye on the 1 dollar bill) which eventually points to the Declaration of Independance as the location of a map. What transpires is an excellent movie that keeps your attention until the final scene.

Nicholas Cage still has the ability to pull off a film like this with humor and wit and make it enjoyable and believable.

There is shooting and one death in the movie which is probably the main reason this move is PG. The death is not graphic and it happens quickly.

For children under 7, this film might be a little long in the tooth (131 minutes) for them and the story might move too fast for them to keep their attention. However, children over 7 (especially boys) will love this film. When my wife and I saw it, we weren't expecting much, especially when we saw all the children coming in. But, once the lights dimmed and the movie started, it was hard for my wife and I believe that this movie was that great.

See it. It is worth it.",1114992000,27,1740,4.388198757763975
1527502,4,B00005JN5E,"First, let me say that it's hard to go wrong with a film that pairs Nic Cage as the star and Jerry Bruckheimer as the producer.  ""The Rock"", ""Con Air"", and now ""National Treasure"".  None of them will go down in the annals of history as ""great"" films, but they're great ""popcorn"" films.

What does this have in common with ""The DaVinci Code"", aside from the fact that they both prominently feature the Knights Templar and their treasures?  They're both puzzle races.  They begin with cryptic clues and take you on a fast-paced adventure where solving each clue leads to another tense race/chase to find the next.  The heroes are scholars, there's a brainy and beautiful female somehow drawn into their quest, and they have to get to the finish line before the bad guys either kill them or get there first.

Yes, it's a formula, but so is the syrup that gets mixed with carbonated water to make the soda you'll drink while watching this.  The intellectuals, effites, and professional critics have tried to make the word ""formula"" have four letters when it applies to the plots of books or movies.  The formula for a house is four walls and a roof.  It works.  It's how you execute/implement the formula that makes it good or bad.  Some ""four walls and a roof"" formulas are called shacks while others are called palaces.

The formula in this movie is a fun one when it's well executed, and ""National Treasure"" pulls it off as well as or better than ""The DaVinci Code"" in my opinion.

Also, if you have the patience, the movie's extras are set up as a treasure hunt with secret code pieces embedded within the available extras.  Once you've watched them all, you can enter the code to get to the next menu of extras.  Fun, but the constant encouragement from Justin Bartha in the Hieroglyphic game started getting on my nerves.",1114905600,2,1823,4.597523219814241
1527503,4,B00005JN5E,"It seems that just about every movie out there in modern times involves skimpy outfits, swearing, or other adult themes. National Treasure is one of those rare films that is fun for the kids, while offering at least a reasonable amount of intrigue for adults as well.

First, yes, let's get out of the way that the plot and characters are rather one-dimensional and only lightly sketched. Ben wants the treasure - but we never really get a sense of why he's seeking it. Perhaps he wants to find it (as he claims when seeking to avoid prison) to 'give it back to the people'. He's joined by a cute female researcher and a cyber-guy. The trio is up against Sean Bean, who wants the treasure for (gasp) monetary gain.

The main appeal of the movie is that the sanitized adventure takes place in locations that you could visit with your family - Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York. The characters move from location to location, deciphering clues and getting hints of masonic involvement. There are creaky underground caverns, guttering torches, and of course, vast treasures. It helps kids to get interested in history, which is a lovely thing.

There is ""sweet"" love between the main characters - one mild kiss is the extent of their affection. There is the child-reedeeming-his-father's-love going on. Without giving much away, good triumphs and evil is vanquished.

I really wish they could have done a bit better job on the coherency of the movie, though. Sure, having it so sweet-and-simple was lovely for the kids. However, they could have had a bit more logic in some scenes. They know that one clue is ""beneath"" a two-word name ... but when they find a plaque with those two words on it, they immediately smash it. When they find that person's body, they immediately cause destruction to the scene, so they can't search it. There's a sundial-type puzzle in one sequence, and they obviously need to know the time of day for the sundial. The puzzle is in three dimensions - they need to know exactly where the sundial points. However, they don't even think at all about what day of the year it should refer to - they simply assume one day is the same as any other.

They use ropes that are over 200 years old, which somehow haven't been gnawed by rats or crisped over time. And, in a scene of ultimate horror for me, they find a room full of ancient documents - and they LIGHT A MASSIVE FIRE. Not only would this have crisped the important papers, but this was in an underground chamber - the smoke and lack of oxygen would have slain them all.

I'm not trying to nit-pick here - there were trillions of little errors if we wanted to get into those. These were the huge, glaring ""No Way!"" moments that caused huge problems with simply following and enjoying the movie. It would have been so easy for the writers to handle these points properly - to keep it 'sweet' for the kids and 'fun' for the adults. So I find it a shame that they couldn't do that properly.

For the DVD, there were a number of special features provided. They definitely aimed this squarely at kids. There are a tiny amount of deleted scenes and alternate ending options. The main group of special features are 'learn about codes' types of exercises. They take quite a while to work your way through - not because they are hard, but because they are really tedious. You have to solve a number of symbol-matching puzzles. You have to go letter, by letter, using your remote control to find the matches. In one puzzle, even though there are multiple copies of a given symbol on the screen, you have to go back and re-select it each time. That's just silly.

But still, it is meant for kids, and the kids might enjoy doing it step ... by step ... by step ... to get all the secret codes to unlock the super-secret features. There is a tiny amount of information about the Masons, and how the purge of the Templars over 700 years ago still affects us in our fear of Friday the 13th. I would have enjoyed even more ""real"" information about the Great Seal on dollar bills and so on. There are many topics touched on by the movie which are just let go. Maybe the hope is that people will use the internet to keep figuring out secrets, long after they finish with the movie.

So in summary, if you have kids in the house, then National Treasure is a great, safe movie to watch together that is a fun story that has a nice moral ending. If you're an adult, I might rent it - but there are many other books out there that cover this topic area (masonic secrets, history of 1776 situation, Templars, etc.) with much more interesting detail. The reality of what went on is even more fascinating than anything Hollywood could invent!",1114905600,27,4697,4.516470588235294

1527508,5,B00005JN5E,"Even though the days of the Adventure genre has been slow somewhat lately, taken over by the more serious side of action and military films, some great adventure films come out that make us feel energized at the end.  From the director of Pirates of the Caribbean comes another adventure of epic proportions.

Meet Ben Franklin Gates, an ecentric ""treasure protector"" on the quest to find the treasure of the Free Masons, supposedly the treasure of all treasures.  Taking on the tradition of six generations, Gates squares off against burning boats in the artic, a restless FBI task force, a ruthless thief, a yelling archivist and plenty of skepticism in the academic community.  Teamed up with the nerdy, feeling left out sidekick Riley, they go quickly from clue to clue trying to find the treasure, but even they get skeptical as to whether the treasure is real or just a legend to fool the British during the American Revolution.

Despite many historical inaccuracies to make the history tie into the movie, it is still a history lesson about the founding fathers and does bring out the American spirit while watching.  I remember emerging from the theatre, wanting to go on my own adventure again just like when I was in elementary school.  The action is pretty good, but not too violent, in fact it's hardly violent at all.  It also has no profanity so all ages can watch it.

The DVD features arn't bad at all.  Buena Vista tried a concept I've never seen before; it's called multilevel treasure hunt, where the more you watch in the special features, the more clues you get to access more special features.  It was cool at first and took me one try to figure out the puzzle.

I watched the alternate ending and I'm glad they kept the ending that's actually in the movie, the trimming was well done after seeing the deleted scenes.  The animatic opening had some interesting parts about the Templars that were actually more intriguing and historically accurate than the movie itself, so they could've done some work there.

Overall, with the historical inaccuracies, I'd give National Treasure a 4.5.  Defintely worth getting when it comes out on May 3rd with the cool special features.",1114819200,,2194,4.797872340425532
1527589,4,B00005JN5E,"...and I want to start this review by saying; This didn't remind me much of Indiana Jones at all. First of all because the lead characters share a very few similarities. And the same goes for the story. It's another treasure-hunt, that's all, and there are plenty of other movies about treasure-hunts. Some good, some not as good, and some better than ""National Treaure"". That being said; The father/son-thing is the only similarity between ""Indiana Jones"" (the third movie that is) and this movie. But then again not quite. The treaure-hunters' father does not play a big part of ""National Treasure"", and I find the part so small it surprises me they even got the fantastic Jon Voight to act in it (well, good money not charity of course...).

What I didn't expect was for the entire (almost anyway) treasure-hunt to take place in a town (in the US). A race among two rivaling themes (one good, one bad - of course) among thousands of people with their map leading them to clue after clue. And then finally to the treasure of course, it is Walt Disney. I expected deserts and ancient, buried pyramids. So it turned out to be far more ""James Bond""/""Mission Impossible"" than ""Indiana Jones"". And it worked.

Action/Adventure would be a proper description of ""National Treasure"". I'm not the biggest fan of Nicholas Cage actually(after a lot of later uninteresting movies), but the man can act - and he really was a pleasure to watch in this movie. He and his collegues. It really shows they were having a good time doing this!

1527590,4,B00005JN5E,"There's a difference between a cheesy popcorn movie and a breezy one. ""National Treasure"" falls into the latter category. ""National Treasure"" is a fun, quick paced film with a nice performance from Nicholas Cage that tips its hat to ""Raiders of the Los Ark"" and other adventure movies without borrowing from them. Turtletaub has made a movie that's fun for the whole family and doesn't resort to the cheap tricks that a lot of other adventure movies use to make its point.

There's gold in them there hills and the founding fathers know where the treasure is buried. Cage plays Ben Gates who is in pursuit of a mythical treasure. Gates and his family have been looking for this treasure for years and he now believes that the final clue--a map--may be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Unfortunately, Gates must compete against his former backer the ruthless Ian Howe (Sean Bean ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Troy"", ""Goldeneye"")to obtain the information he needs.

Filled with marvelous supporting turns from Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, Harvey Keitel ""National Teasure"" despite its PG rating (more for violence and scary images)is great fun for kids and parents alike. While there's enough plot holes to drive a truck through and a number of implausible moments, director Jon Turteltaub recognizes (as Hitchcock did) that if the plot is involving, credible on the surface and breezy fun audience will overlook any minor flaws in a film. He does a great job directing the movie keeping the quick pace and witty dialogue flying.

Extras include an alternate ending which didn't quite work for the movie. There's both a commentary from the director and a introduction by Turtletaub as well. We also see an animatic (a computer generated animation that suggests what the final scene will look like)for the opening sequence again with a brief intro by Turtletaub. The 12 minute featurette gives plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of one of the best action sequences. Most of the rest of featurette focuses on talking heads with the director, producer and actors discussing the production of the movie what they hoped to achieve. It's essentially a promo reel for the movie. There's also about 8 minutes of deleted scenes included as well. At the end of each extra there are clues given that will lead you to a ""treasure"" on the DVD. Once you have the master code you can click on the book in the corner to submit the secret key and get access to your ""treasure"". There's also a couple of additional worthwhile featurettes including one on ""The Knights of Templar"" and one entitled ""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" which I haven't had time to watch as of yet.

""National Treasure"" provides a fun diversion for fans of fast paced action films and, unlike most films from that genre, it's not cheesy action junk. The extras although not extensive are nice additions. Pay attention to the clues at the end of each action sequence and you'll get a chance at your own little ""treasure"".",1114819200,6,2986,4.895256916996048
1527591,4,B00005JN5E,"Another in a long list of Jerry Bruckheimer produced films, this film centers around the possibility of hidden treasure at the hands of our Founding Fathers and the Order of Masons.

The film stars, Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Gates; one of a long list of Gates who have spent most of their lives searching for this mysterious and elusive bounty.  Benjamin, however, possesses the ability to unravel the encrypted clues set before him.

Ben's father, Patrick Gates (played by veteran actor Jon Voight) believes that the treasure is actually an elaborate hoax set in place to baffle the British during the time of the American Revolution at the exact timing as the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  This, as it so happens, plays a pivotal role and significant key piece to the long list of clues needed to decipher the puzzle of the treasure.

Done in typical Bruckheimer fashion, the film is grand in nature even if highly unbelievable; although it's quite the rollercoaster ride you've come to expect in a film of this magnitude.  Running the gamut from Arctic Circle to burial tombs of Trinity Church, this film provides all the entertainment value required for an enjoyable night out.

This is a case of the directors explanation being a interesting as the acutal ending(the movie ending is better).

  National treasure is an above average popcorn flick, that has a fun tone more in the realm of Men in Black or Indepedence day with a twist from the Divinci Code.  It gets all the right mix of comedy, action, sex appeal, a little light history, and a moment or two of fun over the top patriotism.  What makes me really enjoy this kind of movie is that they were able to act out some pretty ridiculous sequences seroiusly enough to aviod it being camp, but with enough humor to aviod being too pretentious.

Gates turns in some heart-pounding chases [loved her hanging from the truck] close calls with our beloved villian [Sean Bean] and, dad-gum it, the FBI is close on his tail.

The theft of the Declaration of Independence [outstandingly mind boggling & brilliantly executed] was a high-stakes crime that fired up the FBI pursuit.

This movie got bad reviews.  Not even bad - abysmal reviews.  And do you wanna know why?  After everything is said and done, it's because there's no sex, no foul language, and it's entertaining instead of disturbing.  Well we can leave them to the business of deciding what our likes and values ""should"" be, and we they can pontificate why movies they view with disdain end up as year-end blockbusters.  With that being said, I feel I should come from a different angle.  This movie is also NOT an anti-Christianity film (and I find it interesting that people would equate it as such, seeing as there are so many other mediums that are).  The plain and simple facts: pretty much everyone involved in shaping this country: from establishing it, to breaking from England, from the signing of the Declaration of Independence, to the men we've elected as Presidents have been Christians.  ALSO, more than half the men that signed the Declaration were Masons.  Simple facts.  George Washington was a Mason.  Ben Franklin was a master mason.  Lodges were established pretty much everywhere across the East Coast.  There's no way to dispute these things because they happened.  Coming to the conclusion that masonry is anti-Christian just shows a lack of knowledge on the subject (especially since most masons are Christian to begin with).  This is a completely different topic (something that I wouldn't mind discussing with anyone via e-mail), so onto the movie.

It's well written, interesting, with a cliff-hanger look into history that more than acknowledges Dan Brown.  (By the way, Dan Brown's new book is on the same subject as this movie.  I'm not sure which is interdependent.)  It's well produced, well casted, with very few lagging moments.  The story is great and the American historical sights are filmed very well, showing masonic influence in virtually everything our Founding Fathers did.  I really don't see how this can be construed as negative.  Perhaps critics don't like Disney.

Seeing an early edition DVD of this movie, I can say that the special features are certainly lacking.  Putting any type of ""history channel"" type documentary of the evolution of templars-to-masons would have been nice.  Even masonry in American history would have been good.  Basically, there's a 5 minute mini-history that covers the same ground as the movie or is common knowledge.  Perhaps the ""special edition"" will have more.  The lacking special features pales to the greatness of the movie.  One of the best!

The dialogue is so predictable and trite you almost groan with foreknowledge.  Cranky old dad?  Check.  Dastardly villian who's lines were written by a six year old?  Check.  Beautiful but brainy girl AND quirky sidekick with throwaway one liners?  Check.  All leading up to a perfectly Disney ending?  Double check.  So if you're looking for a nice little cotton candy film (you know the kind have big fluff and when you take a bite it all disappears), or have some Cage obession, this will be for you.  Otherwise just go grab the Indiana Jones trilogy and enjoy.",1114560000,5,987,4.6686046511627906
1527598,4,B00005JN5E,"THIS IS A MOVIE-IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING AND PROVIDE A LITTLE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF AS IT WERE. ENJOY THE FILM MAN !!!! What the frick is wrong with all this critical analysis by people ? First of all, Dan Brown ripped off most books especially Holy Blood, Holy Grail and he only gisted theories present for years- so quit talking about Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code when speaking of the Templars or any media that discusses the Templars or uses it as a basis for books and movies. Brown's NOVEL presents nothing new although I did love the Da Vinci Code - that said.......First the facts: (1) The Templars were the direct inheritors of the treasures under Herod's Temple in Jerusalem and became very wealthy, eventually melding into multiple esoteric orders from the Rosicrucians to the alleged Priori de Sion to modern Magick circles of Crowley / La Vey. (2)The Templars, post Crusades and after their destruction by the Pope in 1307, took their occult knowledge into Scotland and England where it took full bloom as what we know now as Speculative Freemasonry. (3) This country (USA) was built by forefathers all of whom were Freemasons seeking to break with the English Monarchy to form A NEW SECULAR ORDER based on democracy and the power of individuals and the brotherhood of man, therefore certain Masonic symbols are inside the US CAPITOL structure and layout, many ideas religious and otherwise were Masonic in origin. The possibility that American artifacts could contain symbols, codes and secret knowledge is not only possible but easily researched by COMPETENT researchers. (4) The Templar Treasure exists and some of that Treasure is symbolic or alchemical in nature and not necessarily gold and silver. (5) It is the Templar activities and that of their patrons, the alleged Priori de Sion, that have spread the Mary Magdalene / Jesus theories of Holy Blood Holy Grail, the Last Temptation of Christ, the Da Vinci Code and spread into movies such as The Last Crusade / Indiana Jones.

So, the premise is a model for good screenplays and adventure movies and is fair game. It shocks me that so many find the issue shocking or silly----why ? because they do not do their homework or they swallow all the US / European history MYTHS shoved in our face since grade school ! Anyway, if we have to take everything literally, then how did Star Wars, Alien, Planet of the Apes, 2001 etc etc become a significant part of our culture--there is no freakin Aliens folks but the possibility scares the ......out of us deosn't it ? You bet !

Enjoy a movie for its entertainment value and concede the possibility of the subject matter even if you perceive it as hokey..but let me assure you it is not hokey....it is based on established facts, conjecture and theories espoused by nutballs and scholars alike. You do not have to accept or believe in something to enjoy a movie. This movie delivers ! and it IS good clean fun long missing from the movies and books nowadays.

Like Dan Brown--this is a fictional work or in Browns Case a non-fictional-based-near-factual-fictional-derivative --everybody freaks out every time somebody even challenges tradtional Christianity or world knowledge of secret ativities of powerful secret socieies. These are fictional and the minute we close our eyes to POSSIBILITIES in the world we slap even God in the face. And by the way, God can stick up for himself. I am a Christian myself and absolutely want National Treasure and the soon to be released Da Vinci Code movie in my library and DVD shelf. Awesome stuff !!! And neither of these shook up my faith either. JUST ENJOY THE FREAKIN MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE RANT PART: Hey you know what- if Jesus had kids...so what  ( he still never sinned especially if he was virginal when married and he still could have sacrificed his life as a sin redemption - I am not sticking this in anyones face and saying to believe I am saying the Catholic Church and Fundamentalist Chrisitians of which I am one, have OVERREACTED to this stuff), if Royal Blood ideas trace themselves back to Jesus' and MM's children....so what ---does it change his divinity --not in my book.. also the Life Of Ben Franklin, Leonardo Da Vinci, Nicholas Flamel and Claude Debussy are a good start to your investigation. If you want to learn facts on George Washington, this country and the Templars you must close traditional history books and read qualified authors Ie. Piers Paul Reid, Malachi Martin, Umberto Eco and Zecheriah Sitchin, their work is astounding and will make you open your eyes to worlds more entertaining than National Treasure or Da Vinci Code  - truth is stranger NO ---TRUTH IS BETTER THAN FICTION !!!!

Sit back and enjoy the mythical elements of an accumulated treasure right here in our own country. With knights, freemasons, and historical characters all protecting it with their very lives.

Join Ben Gates as he uncovers clue after clue in an amazing combination of secrecy and evil as he's pursued by those who want to exploit the treasure as their own. Cheer for Ben as he figures out the clues only to find his way blocked by the FBI and his enemies.

With friends at his side, Ben Gates discovers what no one else in over 200 years had been able to figure out. Watch his triumph. Celebrate with him. Be happy for him.

Especially when they pan a great movie like National Treasure and rave about a piece of trash like Monster's Ball. I you are looking for good, clean, adventure with plenty of non-stop action then order National Treasure today. The critics have lost all touch with the American public and have no idea what we want to see. If the action seems familiar and reminds you of Indiana Jones- so what. Those were highly entertaining movies as well. Just sit back and hang on for the rollercoaster joyride of your life... and let the kiddies join in.

1527642,4,B00005JN5E,"This movie is great and is worth seeing. The acting and story are phenomonal, as are the special effects.

That being said, I do have a few problems. First, this movie copies so much from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" that it isn't even funny. For instance, the girls in both movies are blonds with German accents. Also, both movies involve the main characters' fathers. Finally, in both, the main character is betrayed by someone who he trusted.

Another problem I have is that the stealing of the Decleration of Independence was a)Too easy, and b) reminiscent of the ""Mission Impossible"" movies.

Even with the flaws and outright copying of plot elements in this movie, it is still very enjoyable. A definite 1.5 thumbs up.",1114473600,,732,4.7936507936507935
1527643,4,B00005JN5E,"Yes, yes, you critics- the plot is silly and familiar.  The Nicholas Cage-Jon Voight son-father oedipal dynamic smacks of Freud and reeks of 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.'  So what?  This film is fast-paced fun.  What's more- you can actually let the whole family see it!  Perhaps the best part for American viewers is that most of them will have tread the ground at some of the sites featured--Trinity Church, Independence Hall, the National Archives.

Come on, suspend belief and have a kooky good time!  The acting isn't bad and the cinematography and editing are acceptable.  Buy this as an adventure yarn with American touchstones and have a good popcorn-crunching Saturday night on the sofa with family or friends.

The plot revolves around a vast secret treasure, dating to ancient times and hidden by the Freemasons.  It's nice to see that ancient and accepted order shown in a good light, instead of being the conspirator buddies of Jack the Ripper (""Murder by Decree,"" ""From Hell"").

So, watch this film expecting action and adventure but no depth or logic.  That's OK; we all need some eye candy now and then!  Enjoy!",1114473600,5,1135,4.87958115183246
1527644,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure (2004) was one of those films I meant to see in the theaters, but it seems nowadays if you don't see a film within a week or two after it's released, you're stuck waiting for the video as it gets yanked, soon to be replaced by the next blockbuster waiting in line...which is a shame as it's actually a pretty decent, family friendly film despite its various flaws.  Produced by the busiest man in show business Jerry Bruckheimer (Black Hawk Down, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Veronica Guerin), and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, Phenomenon), the film stars Nicolas Cage, who is not only slated to appear in the remake of the 1973 classic The Wicker Man, but is also cast as the title character in the upcoming Ghost Rider film, based off the popular Marvel Comic book (whether these are good or bad things, only the future can tell).  Also appearing is Diane Kruger (Troy, Wicker Park), Justin Bartha (Gigli), Sean `Boromir' Bean (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), Jon `Joe Buck' Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Deliverance), Christopher Plummer (Twelve Monkeys, Dracula 2000), and my girlfriend's favorite actor Harvey `Sport' Keitel (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver).

The film begins by relating a tale of a legendary treasure (originally belonging to King Solomon) that grew to incredible proportions over the years, one that eventually came into the possession of the Templar Knights during The Crusades, who later became the Freemasons, or some such thing (history was never my bag, man).  Anyway, due to the enormity of the treasure, it was decided it was too much for one man or group to possess, so it was hidden away, its existence only hinted at by a series of seemingly unfathomable clues, some of which we see on a daily basis (check out the pictures on your paper money...there's some weird stuff going on there...like that pyramid with the eyeball).  Anyway, Cage plays Ben Gates, a man who's spent the better part of his life following the clues, as his family has intimate knowledge to support the notion that the treasure is real.  Near the beginning of the film we see Ben involved with Ian Howe (Bean), a wealthy financier with a questionable background, but the two part ways as the clues lead them to the Declaration of Independence, specifically a hidden map on the back.  Howe intends to steal the sacred document, but Ben is opposed to this as he's not really a treasure hunter, but a more of a historian interested in preserving the past not for personal gain, but for the benefit of all.  Now Ben must steal the document if only to keep it out of Ian's grubby hands, stay ahead of the FBI...and perhaps find the treasure himself, part of his motivation is that the general public believes his family a bunch of crackpots for believing in such a conspiracy, one thought to be created by the colonial fathers to keep the British busy looking for something that never existed...

Overall I did enjoy this film, as it has wonderful production values and was inherent with a sense of fun.  There are some nick picky things that came up for me like if the Knights really wanted to keep the location of the treasure secret, why have all these clues laying about?  Why not hide it and let the secret of the location die with those in the know?  Because you wouldn't have a movie...also, the whole thing about Ben stealing the Declaration of Independence to keep it away from Ian...why not team up with Ian after it was stolen and work together after all (Ben tried to warn the authorities someone was going to steal it before he did, but they didn't take him seriously)?  Because we needed a bad guy element to keep the pressure on Ben to find the treasure before Ian's group...and the whole theft of the actual document seemed to come off a bit too easy, but whatever...the characters were pretty standard all around, but I did find Riley Poole (Bartha) as Ben's comic sidekick a little annoying with all his smart alecky comments.  He was supposed to be a computer whiz, but his usefulness as the story progressed seemed negligible as his skills really aren't needed much after the theft of the sacred document.  I was slightly saddened to see Voight (Ben's father), Plummer (Ben's grandfather), and Keitel (FBI agent) having such meager parts, as these guys are heavy hitters and could have brought a lot more had they'd been given the chance.  And the character played by Ms. Kruger, who was the director of the National Archive, roped into the proceedings...that whole love interest thing seemed tacked on...but fear not, there are a number of things to like about the film.  The story itself was very interesting, the finding and deciphering of the various clues, seeing how they fit into the grand scheme of things, and seeing where they led was a whole lot of fun.  There's plenty of action throughout, but surprisingly little violence and virtually no profanities, especially considering some of Bruckheimer and Cage's previous films like The Rock (1996), Con Air (1997), and Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000).  I think this stems from Disney's more direct involvement and their wanting to create a more family orientated action film, with an educational spin (which I liked).  Another thing I really liked was the location shots, many around sites of national interest.  All in all, I'd give this film 3  stars as it's a fun ride, despite a few bumps.

The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) comes through beautifully, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio clear as a bell (the Liberty Bell?).  There's a good amount of extras including an `on location' featurette (11:17), deleted scenes (7:47), opening scene animatic (2:21), alternate ending w/intro (1:50), Treasure Hunters Revealed featurette (8:30), The Templar Knights featurette (4:59), Verizon tie-in promotions, and a game called Riley's Poole's Decode This, which enables one to collect codes to enable access to many of these features, including one which I haven't mention (and won't...hee hee, it's not even listed on the Amazon page, but it's not difficult to find as the puzzles are easy).  There are also some previews for other Disney films like Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), and some video releases including Tarzan II (2005) and The Pacifier (2005).

1527645,4,B00005JN5E,"Hahaha... Do you know why I'm laughing? I'm laughing at the morons who gave this fun action/adventure film a low mark based on its predecessors. When people are so full of negativity that they have to slam anything over anything it makes me laugh, because no one is listening and they're only hurting themselves. That's funny to me.

People online LOVE to think they are so smart, love to think that they've caught a new film ""stealing"" from another: You say ""Galdiator"", and they say its a theft of ""Sparticus"", you say ""The Matrix"" and they say ""Tron""--- this can go on and on---and they just *have to* come to Amazon and rage... cause what else have they got to do, right? You've all cheated yourselves out of a good time with your opinionated, self importance--- including professional reviewers who make a living on their asses watching film after film until they are so jaded that it isn't in them to dismiss certain flaws in favor of the experience. This is a movie that one should sit back and enjoy, and not split hairs over. Does anybody go to movies to enjoy them anymore?

I laugh that because a film is made in the tradition of the Action Adventure genre, it is therefore a theft to the kiddies on Amazon, who are only outcasts that are slammed by life everyday. The cool kids dismiss them, the jocks beat them up, the girls won't look at them to spit, they can't get a date to go anywhere with them, and the furthest they travel is to the movie theaters, or the comic book stores where they gather in a bitter-geek gaggle, and decide which films are rip offs of other films.

They've seem em all--- repeatedly--- and they know! Hollywood can't fool them! So they go to movies looking for things to complain about, and Amazon has given them a way to share their bitterness with a community that couldn't care less if you paid them to. It's so sad; so very, very sad. I suppose I should give them credit for not picking up a gun and laying waste to their classmates and teachers while blasting Thrill Kill Kult into their headphones.

Did ""Raiders"" inspire this tale? I'm sure it did. Is National Treasure derivative of the Indiana Jones films? Sure. Did they rip off the Davinci Code?"" No. It's inspired by these things to be sure. And only a fool would deny the money angle, but does that make National Treasure a theft? I think not. There is nothing brand new under the sun, but I saw enough originality to believe National Treasure to be inspired, and somewhat derivative of those films, and though I think ""The dollar bill is trying to tell me something"", is a pretty hackneyed line; I saw no attempt at theft.

So many people here have said National Treasure is trying to ""cash in on Raiders"". I was eight years old when Raiders of the Lost Ark first came to theaters! Today I am thirty-one! What took them so long to decide to cash in? Why did they wait twenty-four years to start ripping off Raiders?

I must have been at the wrong theater. I didn't see any lines, plot points or characters that resembled those classics in any way. I guess I was too busy having fun to see it. Or maybe like many of us I don't sit around watching the ""Indy Trilogy"" over, and over till I know each line. I have places to be and I pay for movies to be entertained, not so I can outwit Hollywood.

From where I'm sitting, this is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no foul language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it.

The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow.

Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure.

I'd be giving National Treasure 3  stars, but Amazon doesn't allow it, so I'm giving it 4, just to anger the haters and amuse myself. To put it simply, National Treasure *will* remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy, Mission Impossible, Sneakers, and ""Ocean's 11"". Note I did not accuse it of stealing from any of these. You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it.

No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark of the Covenant either. It's a fun, fantasy, ""what-if"" kind of movie. Enjoy it, and many thanks for taking the time to read my own worthless opinion.",1114473600,,4793,4.47766323024055

National Treasure is a exciting ride of conspiracy theories. This movie will leave you guessing trying to figure out the clue solving riddles with the characters.
Benjamin franklin Gates( Nicholas cage) has always believed ...Ever since his grandfather told him when he was a kid the story of the legendary knights templar treasure known to be the greatest treasure known to man. He has been obsessed about finding it. But now he is getting closer they find the CLUE a riddle that leads him to map on the back of the Declaration of independence but he is double crossed by one of his team Ian ( sean Bean) who wants the treasure for themselves. So now it's a race against the clock with his partner Riley to steal the document before Ian or risk loosing the Clue and his dream of finding the national treasure be gone forever. will he get the declaration before ian? will the map lead to more clues? will they find the treasure? or is it just a wild goose chase? Watch the movie to find out.
This movie is a must for any action adventure fan. if you love Indiana Jones, The Da vinci Code ....you'll love this movie. This movie gives you a great mix of intrigue,adventure, Romance, Riddle solving with allot fast paced action that leads you on one hell of ride.

Even though I usually love Jerry Bruckheimer films (Pirates of the Caribbean is one of my all-time favorites), the plot sounded too out there and far-fetched to seem enjoyable at all.  However, when some friends from college suggested a movie night at the dollar theater, and this was their chosen flick, I figured, ""What the heck?  It's only a dollar.""  It was honestly the best dollar I spent at the movies in 2004.

Putting aside the fact that the plot does sound a bit weird, there isn't much to complain about (which just proves what I have always believed - professional critics know nothing about what makes a good movie).  Nicholas Cage's portrayal of Benjamin Franklin Gates, history nut and treasure hunter, was outstanding (albeit his knowledge of history did border on an obsession).  As his sidekick Riley, Justin Bartha had me in stitches.

The ONLY complaint I have is that it seemed fairly easy for Gates to actually get his hands on the Declaration of Independence.  That point aside, it's an easy five-star movie.",1112745600,16,1072,4.782608695652174

I loved National Treasure so much, I literally rolled and totalled my Ford Explorer on my way to the set at our state's finest ice fishing resevoir, Strawberry . Thank God for 3 ft. of snow. My daughter and I walked away with only a scratch. Even this did not deter me from going back the following Thurs. That was and will always be the most special day for me. My husband and I, in the company of a wonderful security guard were priveledged to be on the set when the "" Charlotte "" was blown up. What a great movie. You have to understand the passion that we felt that day. I am a HUGE Sean Bean fan, and in my mind he is as sexy as ever. Some other reviewer said he was getting old and flabby. Have you ever considered that is the look the director was going for? It was! Take a look at all his other movies and you will see what I mean. He is a man of many faces and he portrays them all very well!  After a real nice luncheon in the catering tent, we took the sno-cat back to the set and watched Nic Cage and Justin Bartha escape from the smuggler's hold and do their scene about going to the Inuit village nine miles away before going after Ian aka Sean. Someone else said that Nic Cage hasn't done anything good since "" Raising Arizona "" As I am a Huge Coen Brothers fan, I loved that show to death, but again maybe you should look at some of his other movies. Nic Cage is also a very talented actor of many faces. Justin added the comic touch and did an excellant job. Then there are  Harvey Keitel, Christopher Plummer and Jon Voight, three very classy actors who have been around a while and know the score. They played their parts to perfection.

This movie kept us literally on the edge of our seats, with hearts pounding. Talk about non-stop action! It was a very heartwarming, emotional movie with a fantastic story line. When ever my Husband teases me about rolling my car and costing us $10,000.00 to buy me a replacement vehicle, I tell him it was worth every penny!!!! Go buy the movie. You will love it!! I already own two copies of it myself from Ebay and am impatiently awaiting the National Realease of the DVD. Thanks for listening Ciao  Cassie",1112659200,2,2219,4.211764705882353
1527772,5,B00005JN5E,"This was the first movie that I saw with Nicolas Cage in it, and I doubt that Disney could have picked a better actor for the part. National Treasure is a highly adventurous film, and is very good in that it includes clever technology, suspenseful action scenes, and a delightful series of hints and clues that can't fail to keep you interested. The film is made to appear historically accurate, which is vital since most of the goings on concern American history. Really, the only negative factor in this movie is that the humorous moments of National Treasure can sometimes be too random, or be a little distracting from the plot. Still, I would give National Treasure five stars for its expertly planned layout and intriguing display of modern technology, and I would recommend it to moviegoers of all ages.",1112140800,6,810,4.792857142857143

I guess I got interested in what they are about through my Dad - who is a freemason himself.  I should have been a huge critic of this film and picked it apart but I didn't.  In fact I loved it because even though it's ""hollywood"" for most part - there are some truths about the story.  Places that are visited in the film are of historical signicance to both these groups and the symbols are accurate.  It's one of those movies that surrounds the Knights Templar/Freemasonary with even more mystery.  It makes your mind wonder - could something of this (the treasure that was built up over time) really exist?  Many of our laws, practices, beliefs, governments, even our buildings and monuments are based/created from Masonic ideals.  It's a great film for ALL ages that is action packed, funny, exciting, and intriguing.  And its one DVD that you will watch many times over.",1112140800,5,997,4.683908045977011
1527774,4,B00005JN5E,"While this movie certainly had some over-the-top improbable moments, it was also a fun and exciting film in the tradition of Indian Jones.  I say improbable because of the the reasoning of the characters comes out of nowhere as if they were the only people who could figure it, and if our country's Declaration of Independence can be that easily stolen, then we should be worried.  But then, it is just a movie not meant to be fact.  What was really enjoyable about the film was the history and intrigue involving our Founding Fathers and their ties to the super-secretive Masons.  Yes, it does smack of Angels and Demons as well as The DaVinci Code, but it was still a lot of fun.  The writers of this film also deserve special mention because they've obviously done their homework on American history.  They were able to pull facts from real history and use it to create an interesting plot -- that takes work!  History buffs should like the film.  Overall, this is a great adventure film with a little history lession thrown in for good measure; moreover, it's a film the whole family can watch together.

1527835,4,B00005JN5E,"Close on the heels of 'Pirates of the Carribbean,' Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer presents another tresure hunting romp starring Nicholas Cage.  The story, actions and characters are all formularic, and there is always a kind of feeling like, 'I have seen it before,' but I still find 'Natinonal Tresure' very entertaining if not very original.

The film's plot might remind you of bestselling book 'The Da Vinci Code.'  Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates (what?) whose family have been trying to find the hidden treasure, and the clues of its whereabout are, Gates believes, encrypted in America's national monuments and archives such as The Declaration of Independence.  And one dollar note is, according to Gates, another crutial key.

No one takes the screenplay seriously, and no one should.  This is a film made for fun, and in has fairly considerable entertainment value and its own charms.  See, Diane Kruger (much better than in 'Troy') is a curator of the National Archives, but she is there for providing love interest.  Justin Bartha (very good) is Benjamin's computer-wiz sidekick, but he is there for comic relief.  Harvey Keitel is an FBI agent and John Voight is Benjamin's father.  They both sneer at the ideas of our hero, but we know better, for we know who will win in the end.  We know that Sean Bean is doing the same kind of role again, with milder tone of menace.  But knowing that, I enjoyed the film pretty much.

Seriously, the story often gets boring because of the contrived situations, and director Jon Turteltaub ('While You Were Sleeping') may not be the right choice for action adventure film.  However, though the actions themselves are not particularly innovative, they are still competently done, always providing something that might interest us -- like explosion, caper, car chase, and secret tunnels.  The difference is that they are milder than other actioners (it's Disney, you know).

No matter what people say, co-producer Bruckheimer knows what he is doing, and the film is 100 % pure entertainment.  And that's what you get in quite amusing adventure tale 'National Treasure.'",1111622400,5,2128,5.034285714285715
1527836,5,B00005JN5E,"I don't always like Nicolas Cage movies, but this one combines the edge-of-the-seat and cerebral adventures. The scenery was fantastic! Combined Indiana Jones with Tomb Raider, and kept the story believable and the continuity good. I won't give away any of the plot at all. See it with no pre-conception of what the story is. I can't wait to buy it as soon as it's out. My 14 year old daughter went with my husband and me to see it and she wants the movie so bad! What better testimonial than that!",1111536000,4,498,4.423913043478261
1527837,3,B00005JN5E,"Well, the movie was put out by Disney.  Its pretty well known that Walt Disney was a Mason, so I'm sure this release was fairly calculated to present the more and more popular topic of the Masons and Templars.  Ever since ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" (1984? way before Da Vinci Code fame of Dan Brown) by Michael Blaigent and co, there have been more and more popular works available for the public to consume on the topic of the Masons and Templars.  So perhaps this was an official discourse meant to influence public opinion on the ""secret societies"" coming from an actual Mason outlet (Disney).

National Treasure paints the secret guardians of wealth and power as great patriots, preserving a wealthy treasure from the hands of evil.  Nick Cage's character, in traditional Disney film fashion, saves this treasure from the bad guy in the course of traveling up and down the East Coast to historical sites for clues.  The overall story is creative, consisting of clues to the treasure left in hidden on very prominent items like the Liberty Bell, Goodfellow Letters, etc.

Its a nice family movie.  A perfect vehicle to inform the public consciousness with an appealing view of Templars and Masons, who just happen to run every bank in the world.

I must say that it would be a cooler story, though not as generally apreciated, if they traced the actual history of the Templars through their inception as guardians of the pilgramage highways to the Holy Land, to turning on the Church after some important discovery, to creating virtually every modern marketting system (credit cards, cheques), to the Berenger Sauniere story, and all the name changes the organization has gone through.  There are lots of reasons to do a real story on the group, whether it be based on all the occult stuff or not.  Novos Ordo Seclorum and all that.

I'm interested to see what special features this DVD will provide, otherwise I wouldn't suggest paying more than $15 for this movie.",1111276800,,1967,4.804154302670623
1527838,3,B00005JN5E,"Amazing how much a movie will reveal itself through its background score. If you overheard National Treasure playing in another room, it'd probably sound like your dentist's.

But I digress. It's a trippy little fusion of American history and a contemporized Indiana Jones, not to be taken seriously by anyone who's merrily avoided books like ""Cracking the Da Vinci Code"" and ergo still has his ballbearings in place.

After a fussy setup of a whole lineage of bewildered sleuths (Nicholas Cage's family has forever been looking for that One Big Clue, and let's mention here that his name in the film is, nudge nudge, Benjamin Franklin Gates) the movie slithers into a domino of clue-hunting and deciphering a cryptic missive at the back of, gulp, the Declaration of Independence.

Wonder why we didn't go shoveling under the Statue of Liberty or shearing Rumsfeld's scalp to check if his cranium offered some clues.

National Treasure may be a vacuous thriller, but to its credit it's oddly educational. For instance, did you know that Benjamin Franklin is credited not only with the invention of bifocals but also 3-D glasses? Hmm? Hmm?

If that's not your thing, watch it for the no-brainer gunfights and explosions. But for sanity's sake don't expect the copious adventurism of Indiana Jones or the spunk of Team America from last year. For that, The Incredibles is still the film to beat at the theatres.",1110758400,,1409,4.953389830508475

Good guys, bad buys, lots of humor and sitting on the edge of your seat.  It was just a thorougly entertaining family movie.  Friends that weren't interested in seeing it - I talked into going and went with them.  Saw the movie 4 times and have ordered the DVD.

It's just a wonderful adventure and we all left the theatre feeling extremely GOOD - a real upper.  Nicholas Cage was great as was his funny sidekick and of course the girl - what a great idea to have her end up going along for the ride and becoming part of the hunt.

The movie was one of the better adventure flicks I've seen in a long time. It had the right mix of suspense, comedy and actual fact that some movies don't. The absence of heaving cleavage and gratuitous lust dialogue was great. I saw this movie 4 times in the theater--once with family and the other times with my girlfriends on a night out and with kids I was babysitting. I never had to cringe when I had the kids out. They didn't complain of nightmares, either.

All in all, I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD. Oh, and for all the Indiana Jones fans(of which I am one also)they need to hurry and finish the fourth one before Harrison Ford collects Social Security. Sorry Harry!",1110153600,2,866,4.37888198757764

There is no killing in this film and yet the plot moves along despite that, plus there is a lot of intriguing historic fact in it. My husband is a history buff who is tuned in to the History Channel every chance he gets, and he says he saw very few factual errors in this film, and they were not glaring ones either. The story stays glued to the main plot, finding the treasure, rather than dissolving into a smarmy chick-flick or an unbelievable romance.

The story is about Benjamin Gates (Nick Cage) and his quest to find the greatest treasure ever buried, along with the help of his comical sidekick (hey, this is a swashbuckling action movie, right), and his girfriend from the Government. It's Mission: Impossible, every Indiana Jones movie, Ocean's 11, and the Da Vinci Code all rolled into one. The greatest action hit of the year!",1108944000,2,788,4.676258992805756

Just as things start to go his way, the bad guys realize he's their ticket to wealth and chase him for the rest of the movie.  In the end everyone gets what they deserve.

If you're looking to be entertained by a fun romp with lots of action and interesting clues, National Treasure is worth your time.  If you expect some deeper meaning to be revealed or for a film to have an impact on your life, keep looking.",1108512000,3,759,4.71969696969697
1527906,4,B00005JN5E,"I'm not conspiracy theorist, but some of the stuff that was portrayed in National Treasure, is based on commonly known (to conspiracy theorists at least) facts.  The Masons did exist, and they were a rather secretive society; it's not odd to find that many of our most famous presidents were part of the Masons.

Anyhow, onto the film itself.  I personally don't really like or dislike Cage.  I find hims suitable for films where his directness is useful.  National Treasure is such a movie.

Without giving too much of the plot away, the film starts by him finding the ""Charlotte."" A pivotal clue that has been passed down through is family line, who have been searching for it generation, after generation- so much so, that the Gates (the main character's last name) name has a sullied reputation for being ""conspiracy theorists.""

Of course, it leads to the plot where the Declaration of Independence is going to be stolen by the scruffy Boromir (from Lord of the Rings fame); to his credit, he makes the character credible, even if I kept thinking, damn Boromir, didn't you learn that trying to steal the ring is wrong?

Anyhow, Cage decides that the best way to save the Declaration of Independence is to steal it himself.  I mean, his logic is that a thief will just destroy it once he is done with it, while he will only use it to find the treasure and then return it. A rather weak logic, but hey, what is a guy supposed to do when not even the FBI will hear him out?

Needless to say, I think it was rather smart the way the movie approached the clues.  From our awfully curious one dollar bill symbol (I mean, come on, I've always thought that symbol was rather out of place--and smells too much of the Illuminati), to the map being on the you know what.

It's plausible that there could be a treasure hidden. Although, the location itself kind of dissappointed.  It seemed too easy to get to, but you know the old saying, the best place to hide things is usually in plain view.

The movie delivers in an engaging story, that keeps you occupied as it moves from clue to clue, and chase to chase.  The action is not over the top so that it takes over the movie, but it's there in just enough to keep the adrenaline pumping.  There is even a somewhat small love story, if you can call it that; it's funny though, the movie knows the love story is a bit forced and makes fun of itself when one of the bad guys says ""Now why doesn't that ever happen to me?""  It's towards the end of the movie, and you'll immediately recognize it.

Even the end is not a complete cop-out; it's more a compromise.  They do play with your for just a little while, making you think Gates did the predictable ""noble"" thing.  He still acted noble, but with just a little hint of the treasure hunter.

Good movie that won't dissappoint, as long as you are not going in there expecting a conspiracy ladden story like the DaVinci Code.",1108512000,2,2916,4.433395872420262

Cage is first seen as a young boy who is filled with the fancy of the family legend.  You then flash forward as he finally finds a major clue.  The story, from this point on simply takes off and you are on a thrilling adventure ride through history and the present.

What is fun about the movie is not just the action.  You see the Declaration of Independence and find out about other writings of people like Benjamin Franklin.  You also get some behind the scenes views of some of the United States actual national treasures, including the liberty bell.

This movie will take you to New York, Washington DC, Boston and Philadelphia.  Most fascinating is the little history lessons that are placed in, of course, a mythical context of the treasure.  For those who have never seen places like Trinity Church in NY, you will get to see some of it close up.

In eighteen thirty something, the last signer of the declaration of independence, Charles Carrol, disclosed a clue to the secret location of a huge treasure to the grand-grand-grand-grand?-father of Indiana Jones, hmmm, I mean Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage).  The 1830s scene, though brief, is a highlight of the movie, which follows Gates' attempts to track down the lost treasure, hidden by the founding fathers, who in midst of the American Revolution apparently thought more about the needs of 21st century movie goers than about the war that needed desperate funding.  Very far sighted of them.

In the film's recess, (yes, we have recesses in Israeli movie theaters), the friend I saw the film with commented that he didn't know how much of the film was fact and how much was fiction.  ""Well"" I said ""There WAS an American Revolution"".  That is essentially it, though.  I imagine a historian could only sit through this film with fits of clutches of anger - the most obvious offender is the role of the so-called Liberty Bell - which is a latter invention which had nothing to do with the American Revolution.

But this is not the kind of film you go for the history, or the logic, or the emotional depth of characters.  You go to have a good time, and a good time is had by all, except Nicholas Cage, who really seems to wander why he has to waste his acting talents on such low par acting assignment.

National Treasure is carried out with enough workmanship that it is never dull (although the last act and set piece much less so), but it is never engaging, either.  A few good jokes, and decent action sequences make for decent entertainment, but for little else.  Benjamin Gates goes to a great length to find a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence - director Jon Turteltaub seems not to have searched very hard for a decent script.",1105660800,,2088,4.706043956043956

with The Indredibles). You'd think it's just for kiddies, but any adult
capable of just going to the cinema to enjoy themselves should be able
to sit back, gobble the popcorn, suck the straw, nibble on the ice-
cream and just have a couple of hours of unproblematic mania-with good
and bad guys, daring thefts, lost treasures, romance, chases, near
escapes, disasters and rescues and everything you'd expect in this kind
of Bruckheimer production.

The whole thing is paced just right, the villains are just bad enough,
and the goodies are nobles with a roguish streak. The cheesy bits are
mellowed with a dash of wry humor, and those that aren't: well, just
take them, don't cringe and, again, have fun!

I came out of this movie smiling, as did my wife and elder daughter

what we all wanted that day, we got exactly what we asked for.

1527986,3,B00005JN5E,"This film wants to deal with a hot subject indeed, since it is the continuation of the book The Da Vinci Code. It is also a treasure chase and it reminds us of the film The Purple Rivers 2. But it does not have the subtlety of the boo, nor the packed and physical action of the film, nor the historical depth of both. Yet it is entertaining. It of course has to deal with the best protected piece of archive in the US, i.e. the Declaration  of Independence. It deals with the freemasons of the time, with no distanciation with the secret sect they have become, particularly in Europe, to the point that Italy and Great Britain have passed laws to force freemasons who get into public offices, elected or not, to have to declare their affiliation, after some scandals in these countries a few years ago. And don't think France or Germany or any other country are immune, far from it. Of course, like all treasure chase films situated in our countries they become very touristic, and we run from Washington DC to Philadelphia to the northern pole or nearly, though we don't see the Innuits, etc. It picks the old hypothesis that the treasure of the Templars was sent to America in 1315 when the French king decide to crack down upon the order and  nationalize  their property and treasures, a  treasure that apparently either never existed or was stashed away, but no one knows where. The end is a little bit too civic to be really realistic. Such a treasure, in its very concept, is supposed to change the world because it contains many things that are at least disruptive and probably very disquieting for some institutions, the church first of all. Here the treasure is transformed into nothing but archeological riches and gold. It loses its magic and its power. The actors are quite good though the bad guys are slightly too stereotyped. Bad guys today are very trendy and perfectly integrated in the best society. A modern gangster is not very dissimilar from a banker today.

1527987,4,B00005JN5E,"I went to see this movie with the idea that was not good since I read some critics reviews, ok is not Indiana Jones but you have some fun during it, the performances are fine (specially Riley and Ian, each very good in their roles), so I was entertained in those 2 hours and that is why you go to the movies.

The plot is a little complicated, the Nicolas Cage caracther is a man looking for a treasure that has been hunting his family for generations, he has to follow a lot of clues to get it.. and if you want to know the rest go and see it, you will have fun!!",1105228800,,564,3.9473684210526314
1528038,5,B00005JN5E,"With all of the negative reviews of this movie, I almost decided to skip watching National Treasure.  I'm glad I decided to go see it.  This movie is way better than the critics would have us believe.  There are very few slow parts in this film, and I can't think of a single thing that disappointed me.  It is just a great all-a-round piece of work.

The boy (Hunter Gomez) who played a young Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage's character) starts off the movie with a scene that introduces his extreme interest in treasure hunting.  The opening scenes do a great job of explaining and developing the entire plot of the film.  We learn how the Gates' family has passed their treasure hunting legacy from generation to generation.  The script allows this to happen without boring the audience with a long drawn out introducion; and the film quickly blossoms into an action adventure the whole family can enjoy.  By the way, Hunter Gomez looks like a young Kurt Russell.  I would suggest that is Kurt Russell every gets another movie role, and they need someone to play him as a boy, Hunter Gomez would be perfect.

Actor Justin Bartha plays Riley Poole, Ben Gates' sidekick and computer wizard.  Why I have seen some criticism of his performance by others, I think he did an awesome job.  His one-liners and facial messages were delivered with perfection.  He may have a few people who think he missed the mark in this film, but I believe far more people think he pulled his weight and then some.

Diane Kruger plays Abigail Chase, the woman who stands in between Ben Gates and The Decleration of Independence.  Okay, there are a lot of other items in the way: bullet proof glass, heat sensing alarms, video cameras, and sixth-graders on field trips.

Oleg Taktarov plays Shippen, one of the bad guys.  I'm not sure he even has any dialogue but if you are a fan of Ultimate Fighting, you might remember this man from his amazing performance in the octagon.  He was in a brutal fight (I believe it was UFC VI) and he refused to give up, even when any normal man would have thrown in the towell - to fight another day.  This is a man who is going after his dream - to be a Hollywood actor.  Even though he hasn't landed a huge role yet, he has been in some major films.

Sean Bean plays Ian Howe, the double-crossing bad guy.  I really think he underplayed this role.  He needed to seem a little more ruthless, sadistic, and antagonistic.  Just my opinion.

National Treasure was a lot of fun to watch.  I smiled, I laughed, I sat on the edge of my seat at times.  And I wondered if Ben Gates would find his treasure.  National Treasure is great entertainment.  And that's what movies were meant to be.

See ya next review.",1105142400,,2710,4.480572597137014
1528039,5,B00005JN5E,I don't think I have ever disliked anything that Jerry Bruckheimer  has produced.  This movie included.  Nicolas Cage was great in it and all the other people who starred with him shined.  I think the woman in the film actually stole the movie she was whitty and smart at the same time.  But no character stood out more than any others.  I honestly was shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie.  It was well produced and acted.  A must see for any Jerry Bruckheimer or for any fan who loves treasure hunts.,1104969600,2,506,4.365591397849462
1528040,2,B00005JN5E,"Nicolas Cage scored his first genuine hit in a while, though MATCHSTICK MEN deserved to be a hit, with NATIONAL TREASURE, an Indiana Jones-gone-preposterous adventure about the Founding Fathers, the Knights Templar and the Declaration of Independence.

There were so many implausible twists in this and so much hokum that I felt like I should charge Disney for my trip to the optometrist. NATIONAL TREASURE had me rolling my eyes so often that I feared the condition would become permanent.

Nicolas Cage plays the subtly-named Benjamin Franklin Gates, a professional treasure-hunter. (You've met one of those before, right? Anyone? Anyone???) He's convinced there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, one that his family has sought for hundreds of years. Evil treasure hunters are after the map, too, so Gates decides he needs to steal the Declaration first and go after the secret map with a hair dryer and lemon juice (because the Founding Fathers apparently decided to design the map during a sleepover before braiding each other's hair).

Of course, the only person who believes him about the map is the head of the National Archives, a doctorate-holding historian played by a 28-year-old German model with an accent named Diane Kruger. (Plausibility is not the film's strong point, which you realize long before young Kruger starts to fall for the hair-plugged, crow's feet-laden Cage.)

Sean Bean plays the villain, who is really smart until the screenplay requires him to be really stupid. Jon Voight plays Cage's father, which is weird because Voight's actual daughter played Cage's love interest in another Bruckheimer movie. Justin Bartha, the retarded kid from GIGLI, plays the nerdy sidekick.

The mystery's ridiculous. You're better off watching a real INDIANA JONES movie.",1104883200,2,1815,5.244827586206896
1528041,3,B00005JN5E,"It looked like everyone had fun making this movie. It has plenty of action and keeps the momentum going throughout, as the story blithely skirts through history in making a grand treasure hunt out of looking for the lost gold of the Knights Templar and early Masons of America.  What I found so amusing is how Turteltaub made a baton out of the Declaration of Independence as it changed hands back and forth between the good guys and the bad guys.  Hard to imagine such a venerable document surviving the tortures it was put through.  Nicholas Cage and Jon Voight essentially reprise the roles of Indiana Jones and his father in this movie.  Christopher Plummer and Harvey Kietel add further star power to the movie, but it is the fetching Diane Kruger who gives this movie sparkle with her winsome good nature. Don't expect much of a history lesson here.  The film plays into all the intrigues surrounding the Founding Fathers and the writing of the Declaration of Independence, but it does provide some interesting tidbits on Benjamin Franklin, turning his famous colored spectacles into a device for reading the legend on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  It will also have your children looking for tell-tale clues on the back of currency notes.  A good family romp!",1104883200,2,1282,4.82648401826484
1528042,4,B00005JN5E,"This is an exciting, clean and fun movie to watch with the whole family. Although there is a lot of action in the movie, it does not have blood, sex, drugs or inappropriate language.

The history lesson is fun. The acting decent. The props and background explanations are very interesting.

I am sure the writers played with the history part, but overall, I like it because it gave life to our nation's history.

Well worth adding to your collection.",1104710400,,450,4.670886075949367
1528043,4,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure is a unique movie.  It has action movie star power with Nicholas Cage, a savvy bad guy in Sean Benn, and the beautiful Dianne Kreuger as a National Archives director.  Cage, plays Benjamen Gates, a member of a family that for years guarded a vast treasure.  Now, for unknown reasons, Gates is pursuing that treasure with the help of Bean.  Bean turns on Gates and then the rest of the movie turns into a race to see who could find the treasure first.  Cage, Kreuger and the humorous sidekick are in constant danger as Bean and his gang of thugs will resort to anything to get the treasure.

This is an action movie without much action.  Cage never fires a gun, although he avoids many gunshots.  He does steal the Declaration of Independence and is constantly deciphering clues that will need to the next clue to find the treasure.  Despite the lack of action, the movie holds your interest because of the intriguing look at history, the set designs of the final scenes where the treasure hunt concludes and the good acting of the above cast and John Voight as Gates' father.

This movie also stands out as a good family movie.  This movie was made with the obvious intention of not including one single swear word in the entire movie (unless I missed one).  This movie shows you can make a solid movie without throwing in a lot of bad language.  Looking at the success National Treasure had at the box office, it looks like this move paid off.",1104710400,,1462,4.534351145038168
1528044,3,B00005JN5E,"Justin Bartha was so awful as the sidekick, Riley, I couldn't figure out why he was in the movie at all.  Did they ever explain it?  Maybe i was yawning.  I kept waiting for the movie to justify his presence, it never did.  I kept waiting for him to say one funny thing or to change his expression in the slightest.  Neither occurred.  I usually like this type of Walter Brennan part, but this guy turns me off.  He is like a Tom Green without the charisma.

Outside of that, the movie was good.  Many will enjoy it, although on the showing I went to, there were no children.  Do children really enjoy a movie that has no children in it?  If it was me making the film, I would have had Nicolas Cage had a little boy or girl who could have hung around instead of that awful Justin Bartha.  Does Bartha have compromising photographs of Jerry Bruckheimer or what?  Anyhow Nic is looking pretty grim nowadays, you can't believe it when Diane Kruger startss looking at him romantically.  He's a good actor though, and Jon Voight is awfully good playing his dad.  Christopher Plummer looks as though he were cryogenically preserved.  He is so old I thought he was Max Von Sydow and that they would find his body guarding the treasure trove like a mummy.  Kruger is fantastically beautiful and she will remind viewers with long memories of the German actress Marthe Keller who starred with Al Pacino in the great race car picture BOBBY DEERFIELD.  She made the movie fun, she got into the spirit and delivered a farcical performance very different from the labored one she gave up as Helen in the recent TROY movie.

Many have asked, does this movie make sense?  Why do they show Harvey Keitel with that ring on?  Was that supposed to trigger one of those ""a-ha"" moments that explain everything?  If so, it didn't.  But everything about NATIONAL TREASURE is kind of half-baked.  It passes the time, but you've seen better.",1104624000,,1915,4.5321637426900585
1528045,4,B00005JN5E,"When thinking of this movie, the first thing that comes to mind is family. This is a wonderful movie for the family with children of all ages. My brother and I saw this movie with our parents and we are both teenages. Not the kind you would expect to be going to a movie with our parents. Not because we don't like to be seen with our parents, but because we like different movies. We all went to see it together and we ALL loved it.

While it's a wonderful movie for families, it does have some flaws. It is made for families and therefore includes no adult themes or such which is a wonderful thing for a family but not entirely realistic. The story is also a little too far-fetched but is still great and fully-developed in its own. Overall a great movie.. it's worth it to pay for a ticket and see.",1104451200,2,802,4.207792207792208
1528046,5,B00005JN5E,"This was an all-around enjoyable film that made you think.  We tend to take our own rather dull history for granted and National Treasure makes its audience think a bit about what role alternative groups, such as the Freemasons, may have played in its formation (since our country was founded by Freemasons, the topic is worth exploring) as opposed to the ""official"" version.  Nicholas Cage led a fine cast with some marvelous performances by Jon Voigt and Christopher Plummer to round out the presentation.  It succeeded where I expect an action flick to succeed: I wasn't bored.",1104364800,4,580,4.958762886597938
1528117,4,B00005JN5E,"I saw this movie on Christmas Eve and I really liked it.  One word of caution though, don't watch it when your tired or distracted because some of whast goes on is headdy stuff that you won't realize is happening unless your able to completely focus on the movie.  The best part is the ending becuase you expect it to be just the exact polar opposite.",1103932800,,351,4.303030303030303
1528118,4,B00005JN5E,"This is such a fun movie to watch. The experience reminded me of when I went to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-- my expectations were low because it was a live action Disney film, and let's face, those usually turn out to be dismal. ""National Treasure"" has an adventurous story, fun characters, and dives into our nation's history... and may leave you walking out of the theater wondering if it's at all possible.

Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, obsessed with the legend that his grandfather told him of the Founding Fathers leaving behind clues to a great treasure. Clues that are on the Liberty Bell, clues inside a ship buried in snow, and yes, clues on the back of the Declaration of Indenpendence. He has spent his entire life searching, only to be double crossed when he finally finds a good clue aboard a ship that's been buried under snow for years.

The movie is filled with moments that'll make you grit your teeth and clutch your chair. Will he make it? Can he escape? Can he do it? With the help of a goofy sidekick and (of course) a beautiful girl, a historian no less, Gates may just find that long lost treasure. All in all-- very fun movie. All ages will like this. It has the aura of ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-- actually I liked ""National Treasure"" better because it's not so drawn out (which is great for kids because it will probably keep their attention better. ) This is definitely a movie to RECOMMMEND!!!",1103846400,,1436,4.562015503875969
1528119,4,B00005JN5E,"I hardly ever even heard of a movie called ""National Tresure"" until shortly before it came out but upon seeing the trailer, I figured that this is surely a movie worth checking out. It turns out that my expectations were way underestimated. While not necessarily a major smash hit in my book, Nicholas Cage's ""National Treasure"" is a really great movie full of adventure and action.

 The story begins during a stormy night in 1974 where a ten year old boy named Benjamin Gates stumbles upon an old book containing what are believed to be ancient stories of enormous treasures buried in unknown locations. His grandfather John Gates however tells him about how the secrets of large stashes of treasures are stored away in unknown places and that the secrets of them have been passed down several generations through his family but the clue lies on the back of the Declaration of Independence signed by George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and many others in 1776. 30 years later now as an adult, Benjamin Gates is traveling in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica with a fellow archaeologist named Ian Howe to find where they believe a clue to the treasures are located. However things go really wrong when Benjamin is betrayed by Ian.  Now Benjamin is trying to get to D.C. in order to `steal' the Declaration of Independence before Ian can obtain it in order to find clues to where the treasures are hidden. The ultimate answer to that may be surprising to whoever gets there first.

 I was actually pleasantly quite surprised at the good-natured family friendly feel of this movie. While not expecting something that was dark or grim (thankfully), I thought that it would be a very suspenseful and even downright creepy film since it dealt with possible ancient treasures hidden from knowledge. The movie is highly adventurous. This is far better than both ""Tomb Raider"" movies, not that they were bad necessarily. They were okay but ""National Treasure"" is much superior to those. In fact NT brings back memories of when I saw ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"" at the movie theatres when I was very little. It has the very kind of adventure patterns, character personality and dialogue of IJ. In a way, it's what makes ""National Treasure"" a really fun film to watch.

 Mind you the thing that says that something was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is more or less true. It's true that there was writing but based on research on the thing of something written on the back of the document it is actually written as ""The Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"" on the bottom right and upside down. It is unknown who wrote it.

 The acting is also really good as well even if not to the extent of making history in my book. Nicholas Cage is stellar as the eccentric adventurous Benjamin Gates as he defies the authorities in order to find out if the stories of the treasures are true or not and preventing the Declaration from being stolen by his archrival Ian Howe. To my surprise, the actor who played Boromir in ""Lord of The Rings"" Sean Bean also is a major actor in the movie as well and he's great as the antagonist rival adventurer Ian Howe to turns to the side of bad in his own attempt to find the treasure before Benjamin does. The funniest role however was the role of John Voight as Benjamin's highly disagreeing father as he and his son argue over whether or not the stories of the treasures are true or not. It's especially great to watch when he is unwillingly pulled into the adventure with Benjamin as they race against time and Ian's goons. The rest were hit and miss overall but overall the rest of the cast were decent as well.

 ""National Treasure"" is a definite popcorn adventure flick. It does not try to pretend that it's accurate. It's almost completely fictional but blends real life things into fiction but overall, if you don't take it seriously, then you will really enjoy this movie a lot. I did. ""National Treasure"" is yet another great movie worth seeing and one of the better movies of 2004.",1103587200,3,4066,4.672727272727273
1528120,5,B00005JN5E,"Definitely Disney's best in a long time! This movie is packed with a ton of action and suspense. This story is about this man named Benjamin Franklin Gates, played by the talented Nicolas Cage, who is searching for this treasure that no one else believed in. Gates is now on his mission to find the treasure that many of our founding fathers were part of. He found out that there are many clues leading to the treasure. Will he ever find the treasure or is it all just a fake? You will have to go to the theatre to find out. I was wowed by this movie. The effects are awesome and the story line is excellent. It is like a wild goose chase to find this treasure. This reminds me of the popular book The Da Vinci Code in many ways. This is a movie that a whole family will enjoy and remember it for a long time. I would strongly recommend you go see this film!",1103414400,,858,4.113095238095238
1528121,1,B00005JN5E,"In a word,........dreadful!  Nicolas Cage should be embarrassed.  Obviously neither he nor his agent read the script prior to signing on.

This farce revolved around the theory believed by Cage, apparently a treasure seeker, and his family, that a treasure map existed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  This map would lead to the location of the National Treasure, an extensive hoard accumulated by the Knights Templar and Freemasons, and hidden from the British back in colonial times.

Cage in an expedition in the Arctic uncovers a ship buried beneath the ice which holds a key to the mystery.  The probe is financed by Sean Bean, who turns bad guy and tries to kill Cage and his exceedingly annoying sidekick, Justin Bartha.  And so a race commences between Cage and Bean to steal the Declaration of Independence and ultimately uncover the treasure.

Along the way, Cage recruits soon to be love interest, Diane Kruger, a head honcho working in the Archives.

This flick seemed to attempt to copy a format popularized by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; swashbuckling hero, bimbo sidekick and blonde hanger on and love interest.  Unfortunately it was geared for a four year old.  The film was so corny that I rolled my eyes about ten time and glanced at the illuminated face of my watch a half a dozen times.",1103414400,8,1332,4.798245614035087

1528123,4,B00005JN5E,"Jerry Bruckheimer sure knows how to produce a movie. The critics were panning NATIONAL TREASURE before it even opened, doing their darnest to make the thing flop. But it didn't. NATIONAL TREASURE opened huge and left the majority of our nation's critical movie reviewers dumbfounded. Critics often forget that sometimes a movie is worth watching just because it's a movie-- a piece of mind candy to be enjoyed not analyzed. Every movie that's made doesn't have to have a strong message or industry-changing special effects or even a holeless plot. Solely on its on, NATIONAL TREASURE is an average picture. However, because of the enthusiasm of Cage (my favorite movie I've seen him in since THE FAMILY MAN) and Jon Turteltaub's wonderful direction, the film is able to raise above it's average status and become something a little more.

NATIONAL TREASURE stars Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates. Gates is the last in a long line of a family of infamous U.S. historians who are considered crackpots.  At the birth of the United States, Gates' ancestor was intrusted with a clue that would lead to a National Treasure. The National Treasure was a treasure that had been collected and gathered through the ages, preserving not only material wealth, but wealth of knowledge.  The treasure had been protected first by the Knights Templar and then their future heirs, the Free Masons. Anyway, Ben succeeds in located a huge artifact and another clue--something none of his ancestors had been able to do.  However, he is betrayed by his benefactor and is left to die in an explosion.  Ben and his partner find a secret passage for safety and survive. And then the game is on.  It's a race to steal the Declaration of Independence and find the map that's on the back.  Add in some clues left in our money and Harvey Keitel as one tough cop and Jon Voight as Ben's father and you've got one great piece of mind candy to watch, especially during the holiday season.",1102896000,,1949,4.782738095238095

POTC made 300 million, Incredibles made 200 million and NT is getting close to 120 million. But overall a fun movie and its nothing that special, its like a family version of the DaVinci Code.

1528187,4,B00005JN5E,"Many critics hated this movie and because of that, I wanted to see it.  Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, a character who grew up obsessed with the idea that America's founding fathers had buried a treasure of unspeakable value and left cryptic clues as to it's location.  Due to a greedy member of his team, Gates has to play the role of reluctant hero and steal the Declaration of Independence before the bad guy does in order to protect it and the treasure he is seeking.

Raiders of the Lost Ark this is not.  There's not a lot of depth to the characters, some scenes feel rushed, and obviously the plot is, well, a little unrealistic.  Despite the flaws, though, this movie still takes you on a great adventure with early American history as the backdrop.  It's just a lot of fun.  Good chase scenes, lots of clues and intrigue and a few little twists to keep things moving - all without a single instance of profanity or nudity . . . hmm, I didn't know Hollywood could even do that anymore.

1528188,5,B00005JN5E,"I absolutely loved this movie! The whole thing was entertaining. I think the only part that annoyed me was that our hero only had to dig a little to find THE CHARLET. And, if the ship had sunk why wasn't there any water left in the ship? Everything was ship-shape. But other then that it was great! Only Nicholas Cage could pull this off. You don't think he is related to Harrison Ford? Although, this will never take the place of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it stands as a masterpiece. To me, that is. Not bad for PG. Disney seems to be moving up in the world. I've seen the reviews for this movie and IT IS NOT A FLICK! Just though I'd make that clear for any of you who have not seen this yet. This was a pretty clean movie. There were some threats made but no one died. It would have been nice if it had a little more action, though. Jon Tureltaub does it all with touches of humor. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure has its share of Romance. But, they don't throw it on thick. That is usually the downfall of and excellent movie. There are enough clues to keep you guessing. Once again here is another one with a stunning cast. But, cage is the one who made it. Without him I don't think the movie would have surfaced. It still would have been good but not superb. From the start the director feeds you with little bits of the story, and then he gives it to you. I won't tell you the ending, but it's really good. You will be satisfied, I promise! So, if you have nothing to do this holiday season, I would go see this. I think you'll find it's a lot better then you think.",1102291200,,1589,4.129032258064516
1528189,4,B00005JN5E,"Nicolas Cage and Jerry Bruckheimer have done some pretty decent movies together.  ""The Rock"" was pretty good along with ""Con Air"" and ""Gone is 60 Seconds.""  I figured with their past that I would take a chance and check this movie out.  And I wasn't disappointed with the results.

The movie is about a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage).  His family members have been searching for the ""greatest treasure in the world"" for many generations and have not been able to put the clues together.  On a search for the treasure, Ben finds a clue that indicates that the treasure map is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, written in invisible ink.  One of his expedition team members Ian (Sean Bean) wants to steal the Declaration of Independence to get the treasure map.  Ben does not want to.  Convinced that Ian is going to steal the map, Ben does it himself to ""protect"" the document.  He finds clues on the back of the document and engages on a treasure hunt through history.

The movie itself is really good.  It has a very good and intelligent storyline.  It all works out very well.  I like the locations that were used in the movie, such as Washington D.C. and some historical buildings in Philadelphia.  The movie  is rated PG so the action is kind of limited.  Nicolas Cage does good as Ben.  I think that he plays the same character in every movie, with the exception of ""Adaptation.""  The supporting cast is fine, with Diane Kruger being good eye-candy.  The only real question that I asked was why it was okay in Ben's mind that he could steal the Declaration of Independence and find the treasure with it, but it was bad for Ian to steal the document and do the same thing.  I guess the movie needed a bad guy.

Overall I would recommend seeing this movie.  If you like history or suspense movies where you have to think a lot, then this movie is for you.  If you don't like either of those, still check out this movie because your opinion may change.",1102204800,3,1989,4.507002801120448
1528190,5,B00005JN5E,"A lot of the reviews on this movie have downplayed it as low-brow escapist fair, but this movie is really all about entertaining the viewer.  Fast paced and interesting, this is a typical, above average Bruckheimer blockbuster.  There really is nothing to dislike.  The characters are fun and likeable.  The plot races along and the clues--steeped in historical fact--make you wonder if that part of it is true.

Most of the sets are located at historical locations like Washington DC, New York, and Philidelphia.  There is a lot of historical trivia here that has ended up increasing visitation to historic sites.  That has to be a good thing.  Of course there is not treasure at the end of the clues, but that does not take away from the appeal of this movie.

Additionally, the movie is inoffensive, non-violent and family friendly.  How can it go wrong?  A good movie to spend an afternoon at.",1102204800,,897,4.759740259740259
1528191,5,B00005JN5E,"National Treasure has a lot to offer for a PG rated movie.  This was the first adventure/treasure hunting movie that I have seen that was based in the United States, which was quite refresshing.

The plot of the movie is that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there is a map to an a treasure trove.  Nicolas Cage's character and his group of friends are trying to seal the Declaration of Independence to prevent the ""bad guys"" from getting it and the treasure.  Along the way, the group encounters numerous other clues that further lead them to the treasure.

This movie is a typical, fun adventure story; an action film without all the blood and violence that has become too common these days.  I would say that this movie takes its cues from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (one of my favorite movies of all time).  There is the father/son relationship between Cage and Voit, the intelligent, hot blonde woman with a foreign accent, and and a catacombs.  There is even a scene where Cage has to decide whether to save the woman or save the Declaration of Independence (you will be surprized).  Despite these similarites, National Treasure holds its own and does not seem hackneyed.

Nationan Treasure is an appropriate family movie, but is worth watching no matter how old you are.  It is pretty good for a Disney movie, much better than ""Pirates of the Carribean.""",1102204800,,1383,4.6970954356846475

Jon Voigt, Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger give very realistic and emotionally compelling characters to this highly suspenseful modern day treasure hunt.  I didn't really care to look at the exact rating on this film and who starred in it so I didn't know what the limitations were going to be like. My dad told me that this was a good film, so I just took his word for it.  At first, I didn't really know what to expect.  In fact, when I saw the bad guys for the first time doing what bad guys do best, I thought that there was going to be a lot of mayhem and blood in this film--but suprisingly there wasn't.

For some reason as many critics hated National Treasure as much as they loved The Polar Express. Express is a mutt disguised as a pedigree puppy, while National Treasure knows it's a mutt and goes along with it, turning tricks to become a worthwhile action film.

The premise is simple: there's clues to over ten museum's worth of treasures on the back of the original handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Gage (decently underacting for once) plays the black sheep of a family of treasure hunters, and decides to steal the document before former colleague Sean Bean pilfers it and finds the treasure.

National Treasure is about fifteen minutes too long, wastes lousy dialogue on two great actors, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel, but as it goes forward it becomes an enjoyable cat-and-mouse game between Gage and Bean. National Treasure is formulaic, yes, but a nicely done formulaic, action-thriller.",1101772800,,942,5.143790849673203

Nicolas Cage's funny ""sidekick"" was a good addition that added a lot of laughs and one-liners.  For me, one of the bests part of the movie was the on-location filming in the rotunda and other parts of the National Archive, which I happened to have visited this summer (by the way, if you get to Washington D.C., make this your first priority to go see.  It inspires lasting awe, and would you believe it's free).  Like the DaVinci Code, which had a lot of readers dashing to their computers to look at ""The Last Supper"", I bet a lot of people who see this movie run straight home and Google Ben Franklin's Silence Dogood letters.

If you can overlook the obvious flaws (such as walking 7 miles in the Arctic circle with no problem and guards at National monuments that never seem to be around) then you will love this film.

Anyone who has read The Da Vinci Code will recognize from the outset of this movie what a blatant and shameless rip-off it is of the best-selling book.

For starters, the Knights Templar, The Free Masons, the secret societies, the mysterious and elusive hidden treasure, etc., etc.  To make matters worse, I didn't exactly find it absolutey necessary for Nicolas Cage to launch into unprovoked historical pontifications ad nauseam while he deciphered the painfully predictable clues out loud to the audience - all of which made the whole movie nothing more than mindless fodder for the masses.

The only thing stopping it from being one star is the stellar acting of Diane Krueger.  How she put up with this drivel is beyond me.",1101427200,2,860,5.049645390070922
1528374,5,B00005JN5E,"Just got in from seeing National Treasure (""NT"" - Hey that points to the New Testament and there really is Treasure in there: Jesus Christ our Lord & Saviour) and I must state the film left me hanging on each turn.

The film National Treasure caught my interest as many friends consider me 'conspiracy minded' .... I just think that I just happen to be able to think...but with all the showing of Masonry, US History and the secret ""buried treasure"" who could resist?

The beginning starts off like Spielberg's Goonies....plundering in the attic (one of my favorite past-times, its just that I have no Old chest of Confederate Bills or Bonds, or old treasure maps, etc.) and he is told the legend of his family's quest to find the national treasure.

This of course pulled me in immediately as the tale was relayed (I thought there'd be mention of CSA Gold or Albert Pike with the 33rd Degree Masons, etc. but no) and it was all very interesting - the Revolutionary shots were great too!

Then we come to the present day search for who or what is the secret message and this is discovered and that leads to the beginning of another clue..which leads to another clue (that's REALLY hard to get) not to mention your former pal, Ian Howe (Sean Bean: who starred as Boromir in LOTR!!) is ticked off at you and you've got to beat him to the clue (which allows for some ACTION!) then this and that happens and then another breathtaking turn and then....BINGO! another clue and now Dad (John Voigt: who was FDR (the famous Socialist Minded President of the USA) in Pearl Harbor, & Noah in the TV series in 1999 (although some of the chronology is out of place in that series..) and I can't forget his role as Peter Miller in the Odessa File which was out in 1974) gets dragged in...

Now should we call for Blue? From Blue's Clues On Nick? Hey it sought to be that easy for all of yall out there, right? Surely you know your history? No wait most of yall know propaganda... who ME Conspiracy Minded???? Naaahhh. Anyway,

One clue leads to another and now leave it to the Feds to get involved, and they ALWAYS do.... so now we have Ben Gates (Mr. Cage remember Sgt. Joe Enders from Windtalkers?), his friend and the Comic Relief of the film Riley Poole (Mr. Bartha) and the lovely Historian Abagail Chase (Mrs. Kruger) and FDR...I mean Patrick Gates (Mr. Voight) attempting to find the clues and elude Boromir...oops I mean Ian and the Feds lead by Sadusky (played by Harvey Keitel) so finally in the end.....

One clue leads to another and then another and then the stirring end.... will they find the national treasure?? I aint gonna ""spoil"" it for you....go find where the ""national treasure"" is near you!

In the end I believe there is an important moral to this: ""Not All Conspiracy Folks Are Nuts They Just Have Guts! (not to mention Faith - they ""we"" believe the Truth is out there...) Check it out folks, you'll enjoy it whether you're Conspiracy/History-Minded or no! To me it's a film to 'treasure.' :)",1101427200,,3004,4.529520295202952
1528375,4,B00005JN5E,"If you're looking for a fun, light-hearted, fast-paced adventure without a morsel of plausibility, ""National Treasure"" is for you.  It doesn't pretend to be a historical fact-based film, it doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is; heaps of fun!

Director John Turtletaub has crafted a 21st century Indiana Jones with Nicholas Cage taking on the Indiana Jones role.  Not only is Cage charming in his signature ""lovable dork"" portrayal of treasure hunter Ben Gates, but he's also funny and able to be somewhat convincing as the love interest of someone as beautiful as Diane Krueger's Abigail Chase.

The story is typical Indiana Jones, involving a map invisibly written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, treasure (obviously), bad guys, heists, humor, and a wee bit of romance.  The plot is in no way believable, but please explain to me why that is a bad thing!  Was the Indiana Jones franchise ever criticized as harshly as this film is for outlandish plots?  I don't think so.  Why should this film be judged any differently?

The bottom line is that ""National Treasure"" is a supremely entertaining, thrilling, and fun action flick that is sure to have you leaving the theater with a goofy smile on your face... and a craving to be a treasure hunter yourself!",1101427200,3,1280,4.861751152073733
1528376,4,B00005JN5E,This is the kind of movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. Even though this has a Indiana Jones type feel to it. Nevertheless Nicholas Cage was excellent as person trying to find the lost treasure behind the declaration of independence.

1528377,5,B00005JN5E,"Sometimes I think critics are a little too serious about things.  I admit I was scared to go to see this film because it only had a 38 on the Tomatometer (rottentomatoes.com) and the local papers had really killed it.  It was dumb, nonsensical, illogical, the characters had no chemistry, blah blah blah.  Cage was too over the top and how could anyone believe something like a map on the back of an historic document...and so on

Well, maybe all that's true, but I still had a blast with this movie and I will get the DVD when it comes out.  I thought Cage was perfect here as was the rest of the cast.  Justin Bartha was hilarious as Riley, Cage's friend and partner who had the best lines in the film.  Jon Voight was stoic but effective as Cage's cynical father who understands his son's desire to hunt for a legendary treasure but is chagrined because he feels he has thrown his life away in vain on the same pursuit.  Diane Kruger is super as a civil servant who joins the fun when she is finally convinced Cage is not the enemy.

When this film finally comes out on DVD, I'll be first in line.  You know this will be loaded with stuff on the history behind the founding fathers and how some of the ""clues"" really came to pass in history.  Besides that, this movie has lots of repeat watchability.  It is fast paced, tightly woven, full of action, has interesting characters who are fun to watch, and has a lot of fun with some of the history of the country.  I'd go back to the theater today if I could and see it again.  Grab a big bucket of popcorn and settle in for a good time.",1101168000,4,1588,4.25
1528378,2,B00005JN5E,"OK, I figure that everybody knows how ridiculous the plot of this movie is before they go in to see it.  There is a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  They say the words ""The Declaration of Independence"" so many times in this film it makes you want to scream.

There is nothing original about this film.  (I have not read the book, The Da Vinci Code, but apparently this is a rip-off.)  When the movie opens, I wanted to shout out to Nicholas Cage, ""Don't trust Boromir!  Didn't you see Goldeneye?  He always turns traitor!""  Yes, the standard allotment of heroes and villains are here.  Also, in the grand tradition of Bruckheimer, everything old in the world was designed by Disneyworld: it's never JUST a basement - it's a rollercoaster leading to a basement.  The have lights and machinery that still work after two hundred years of neglect.  The plot hinges on a series of riddles that are so dumb, NOBODY should ever be able to figure them out, but Nicholas Cage does.

What is the point of the movie?  To act as a travelogue for America's Historic Cities.  ""You too can see the LIBERTY BELL in historic PHILADELPHIA!""  We visit all the main American cities on the eastern seaboard - Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.  The problem is, they want us to believe there are ancient tombs beneath the city of New York that were built in a time when such architectural feats were impossible.  Even if they were, nobody would have done it.  And if such a treasure existed, how did George Washington get it, and why would he ever keep it a secret?

To ask such questions is wrong of such a movie.  It assumes there is any correlation to real life.  I went into this film expecting a long, dumb movie filled with pretty pictures and a LOT of explosions.  I wasn't disappointed.",1101168000,2,1821,4.555555555555555
1528379,4,B00005JN5E,"Call me crazy, but there are a lot of similarities between this story, and the succesful Dan Brown novel, so much so that Ron Howard who is currently making THAT movie, may want to watch this for some tips. This is GREAT fun, and a good family action/adventure romp. Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, one of a long family line of treasure hunters, eschewed by his peers, and the scientific community in general, for having chased a ""mythical"" treasure most of his life. After finding a very big clue to his quest in the Arctic, he is double crossed by his financial partner (Sean Bean) and left in the snow while the former returns to Washington, to plan some nefarious activites. In case you haven't seen any of the trailers, the premise is that there is a hidden map on the rear of the declaration of independence which Cage must protect by stealing it himself. The implausibly young and attractive archive director Dr Chase (Diane Kruger)gets caught up in the action, as does Cages father played by Jon Voight, and his quirky computer whizz sidekick essential to attract the 14-21 demographic. The key word here is Improbable (or any other synonym you may choose) as Cage is able to decipher each more increasingly obscure and difficult clue, by simple brainstorming, and plenty of AHA! moments after pause for thought lead us on to the next level. If you can forgive this aspect of the story you will love this movie, there is a lot of action, escapes, a little romance, and Cage et al are believable for the most part. Will they find the treasure? - well you'll have to see for yourself, but if you want a family adventure sure to appeal to all ages this holiday season, this is the pick of the bunch so far.

1528380,4,B00005JN5E,"""National Treasure"" is a blatant rip-off of books by Dan Brown like ""Angels and Demons"" and the more recognizable ""The Da Vinci Code"".  The only real change instead of the controversial religious themes of the books, ""National Treasure"" centers around a treasure hunt.  Considering that this movie comes from the unholy duo of Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures, it is no surprise.  Bruckheimer has been turning out crap for years, and Disney's glory days are well behind it.

That being said, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining (but unbelievealbe) movie.  Ben Gates (Cage) believes that the founding fathers have buries a treasure somewhere and have laid out clues to finding it.  In fact, his family for generations have believed it.  When Gates finally figures out a key clue, he is off to the Arctic in search of the treasure.  A double cross by one of his team (Bean) leaves him for dead and the bad guy after the treasure.  From then on, it is a race from clue to clue to find the hidden treasure.  Along the way, they even steal the Declaration of Independence.

The action is fast paced and engaging, and the clues are woven into real world items.  Nicholas Cage does nothing special with Ben Gates, lapsing into standard Nicholas Cage mode.  Fortunately for him, that works (as it does in most of his movies).  The supporting cast also does a good job, but nothing spectacular.

The problem I had with this film is that it ddrraaaagggss along at a snails pace.  Nic Cage is his usual hero self and actually he's quite funny.  The screenplay is laced with humor, but suffers from long winded scenes where Nic tries to overexplain things.  The dialog gets lost and is somewhat confusing.  The direction is too loose for an exciting ride, but it is alright for a popcorn movie.  Thats really what it is.  Jerry Bruckheimer is capable of making more exciting popcorn thrillers.

Nicholas cage did a great job, as well as his comic sidekick and the chick that hooks up with them. Basically, there's a huge treasure hidden somewhere. It's location is a secret, and he has spent his life looking for it. Before him his dad looked for it until he got frustrated and bitterly gave up. His grandfather also searched for it. There's clues to be found, and each clue leads to another clue, and eventually they find out that there's a clue hidden on the back of the declaration of independence. Earlier on, for financial support he hooked up with a rich dude with questionable ethics, but then the rich guy decides he no longer needs cage, so he tries to kill him. Cage ends up just beating the guy to stealing the declaration and so it's basically a race to find the treasure at that point. Meanwhile the FBI is trying to catch Cage also, as they don't know about the rich guy even. It was a pretty fun movie, in the respect of indiana jones movies. I heard some not so great reviews on it from critics early on, but for all the reasons they probably didn't like it, I thought it was good. It was funny, and light-hearted, and didn't take itself too seriously. The theater was packed, and the audience seemed to be laughing together at the right times. All in all, a pretty good movie.

Or rather Brown's sources, since the two projects were near-contemporary. Other obvious sources of inspiration include the Indiana Jones flicks and Romancing the Stone.

Nicolas Cage stars a conspiracy theorist actually named Benjamin Franklin who steals the Declaration of Independence (!) to find secret codes revealing the location of the famed treasure of the Knights Templar. Then, the hunt is on, with our hero being chased by evil treasure-hunters, FBI agents and (perhaps) Templars. Meanwhile, various more or less farfetched clues to the whereabouts of the treasure are analyzed by Franklin's team, including computer geek Riley, who is nerdy without being cringy.
