Using tracking dogs, footprint paths, kill sites, and trail cameras, Casey Anderson and Tyler Johnerson have an exhilarating experience in searching for and filming mountain lions.  They also describe their life-threatening encounters with mountain lions.  Mountain lions are shown in trees in daylight, and a female mountain lion and her kittens are filmed at kill sites at night.  The documentary also features a large male mountain lion with only one eye, whom I viewed as an excellent candidate for an organ regeneration experiment.  An accurate mountain lion population estimate for North America is uncertain with a range of 10,000-50,000.  A mountain lion can jump horizontally up to 40 feet, and I remember reading that a mountain lion has a vertical jump of 18 feet.  There are many scenes of snow-covered mountains, and sensitive piano music is featured throughout&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalking-the-Mountain-Lion/dp/B00BF371U8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalking the Mountain Lion</a>.
