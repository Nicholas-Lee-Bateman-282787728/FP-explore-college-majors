8102610,3,B000DN5VK8,"This is a better than average entry in the PRC ""Lone Rider"" series starring George Houston and Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John. George and his sidekick Fuzzy arrive in town dressed as guitar strumming dudes which throws off the townfolk. The tough hombres in town order George and Fuzzy to get out of town, but they refuse to leave.

The sheriff is in on the duo's secret and soon George (the Lone Rider) and Fuzzy are out bringing the outlaws to justice. There's more singing and comedy than assorted violence in this little horse opera, which sets it apart from the average Poverty Row Western.  Also, Alpha's film transfer is not great, but it is watchable.",1314662400,,648,4.626086956521739
