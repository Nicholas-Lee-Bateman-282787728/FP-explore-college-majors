6578720,4,B00MI56U6S,"100 feet can be a long distance.

Especially between cultures, generations, menus, even time to cook and serve gourmet meals. Or, in the case of Lasse Hallstroms delicious dramedy The Hundred Foot Journey, the street separating two restaurants in Lamaire, France holding two respective sets of aspirations.

One, Le Saule Pleuer, is a treasured French restaurant owned by longtime restaurateur Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). It holds to 200-year family traditions and consistently earns Michelins coveted one star review while aspiring for two (three reserved only for the gods.)  The other, Maison Mumbai, is owned by an upstart, proud Mumbai chef family, the Kadams, led by their Papa (Om Kuri, warm and jovial). The Kadams moved to Europe amid political strife and personal tragedy only to see the brakes put on their aspirations when failed car brakes land them in Lumaire, then with them revamping and opening a restaurant across from Mallorys.

This new French and Indian war becomes an elegant food fight, but quickly takes grows roots and takes casualties. Buying up the days fresh food becomes battles with local code enforcement becomes an act of racist terrorism, drawing both restaurant owners to make peace for the sake of their futures  especially their respective children Hassan (the suave Manish Dayal), a cook whose tenure with Mallory leads him to become the toast of Paris dining, and Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bonm), whose cooking collaborations with Hassan evolve from friendly rivalry to passion.

Hundred Foot Journeys visuals dazzle and intoxicate, in and out of the kitchen. As its story switches briskly from French to Indian cuisine, from country town to Paris lights, and across years and seasons, each player in the drama shows their humanity and desires for spiritual comfort food. Proud father wants his son with him but also wants him to taste international success. Perfectionist businesswoman holds traditions to honor her late husband as well as provide her daughter a legacy. Ms. Mirren seems incapable of a poor performance; her clipped French accent is forced but she says more with a stiffening of back or eyes over her glasses anyway than most actresses do in lines of dialogue. Dayal and Le Bonm also swerve between salty and sweet, both waiting in the protective wings of their parents/mentors while awaiting their chance to star.

The Journey ends a bit too predictably as earlier rivalry between dedicated, fiery chefs families ventilates into a smoky, sentimental ending. Still, Hundred Foot Journey again demonstrates food is love, not only for couples but for families and expanding communities. This kind of film is rare in a summers thrill-ride box office, but The Hundred-Foot Journey is well-done and savory. And recommended.",1409702400,,2776,5.224719101123595
6578721,5,B00MI56U6S,This film moved to the top of my favorite movies list. Subtile and full of sensitivity and an outstanding performance of the actors.,1409616000,3,132,4.782608695652174
6578722,5,B00MI56U6S,"Directed by Lasse Hallestrom (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Chocolat) from a screenplay by Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Dirty Pretty Things) based on the book by Richard C. Morais, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a marvelous film, intimate in its setting but universal in its themes, and surprisingly romantic on more than one level.

The story is centered around Hasan Kadam (Manish Dayal), a young man from India who from early childhood has shown a natural instinct for food, a talent lovingly nurtured by his cook mother (Juhi Chawla) as he grows up working in the family restaurant in India.  Tragedy comes early though as the family is attacked in a riot that follows an election, resulting in the restaurant being burned and his mother dying in the fire, which leads the family to leave the country. Papa Kadam (magnificently played by veteran Indian actor Om Puri) first takes the family to England, but after finding the weather too cold and the local food uninspiring, decides that they should try their luck in Europe instead. They journey around with the family and all of their possessions tucked into an old beat-up van, stopping here and there to sample the local produce, looking for the right place to start over again.

Fate steps in when they reach the French village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val where the van's brakes suddenly fail, resulting in an accident that leaves the family temporarily stranded. Fortunately a kind young Frenchwoman named Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) notices their distress and takes them to her house where she gives them their first taste of local food.  And then temporarily suddenly changes as Papa begins to look around, checking out the local produce market and coming across an abandoned restaurant that is for sale. Which leads him to announce to the startled family that they're staying, that this is the place they've been looking for.  When Hassan asks his father, who apparently regularly consults his dead wife, what his mother thinks, Papa says in complete seriousness that she told him ""Sometimes brakes break for a reason.""  And so they end up staying.

At first Papa's judgment seems highly questionable, first and foremost because the restaurant he's decided to buy is just across the road - a hundred feet to be exact - from a well-established and highly regarded one-star French haute cuisine restaurant run by the imperious Madame Mallory (equally magnificently played by veteran British actress Helen Mirren), who does not take the arrival of these upstart foreigners kindly. And in no time at all it's war between Papa and Madame Mallory, both resorting to all kinds of tricks and appeals to the much-beleaguered local mayor (Michel Blanc) to make life difficult for the other.

Complicating the situation further is the fact that Marguerite, whom Hassan is finding himself liking a great deal, works for Madame Mallory. And the fact that Hassan wants to learn to cook in the French style, setting up a kind of Romeo & Juliet situation. Except that in this case Hassan and Marguerite are also rivals, each wanting to move up as chefs but realizing that the other is their main competition.

Saying anything else would amount to being a spoiler. Suffice it to say that things develop in unexpected ways, not only between Hassan and Marguerite but also between Hassan and Madame Mallory. And between Madame Mallory and Papa. The film truly engages you as you watch things unfold, helped along by a marvelous cast in the hands of a gifted director telling a very intimate and yet universal themed story. Helping things along are the lush cinematography by Linus Sandgren (American Hustle, Promised Land) and a lovely mood-setting score by A. R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire, Million-Dollar Arm, 127 Hours) that flows easily back and forth between the traditional and modern as well as the European and Indian elements of the story.

Special acknowledgement should be given to Mirren and Puri's performances.  Even though all of the actors involved give fine performances, Mirren and Puri absolutely dominate every scene they're in, and the scenes with the two of them together are priceless, particularly a scene where the two adversaries end up bargaining with each other across a table over Hassan's future. And I loved the scene where on the new Indian restaurant's opening night, Papa Kadam shows his family that just because they're in a different country with a different culture, it doesn't mean that his traditional old-fashioned ways of enticing customers into a restaurant won't work just as well in France as they did in India. And the scene where Mirren's Madame Mallory reacts to Hassan's attempt at preparing one of her restaurant's signature dishes stands out as well, showing in her facial expressions and body language the powerful emotional turmoil that the experience causes her.

Highly, highly recommended.",1409356800,267,4889,5.067164179104478
6578723,5,B00MI56U6S,"What a fantastic way to wrap up the summer! I am not the biggest fan of
romance films, which is what I expected from this film initially.
However, The 100 Foot Journey is a funny, inspirational and delicious
adventure that everyone will love.

This isn't just a romance film. This has a lot of cooking with a bit of
love spiced in with the cooking, there are some fantastic one-liners
that make the audience roar with laughter and this is all included in a
fantastic adventure.

The story starts when an Indian family that cooks at a school, has to
leave the school for very sad reasons. They end up in France where they
start a restaurant. However, across a 100 foot wide road, there is
another, very different restaurant. A huge adventure starts with the
chefs, the owners, and some other people too. If you want to find out
what happens you got to watch the film!

This film is produced by a great partnership of Steven Spielberg and
Oprah Winfrey based on a famous novel, so it was bound to be a
masterpiece, and it is! The actors are funny. They are very much in
touch with their characters and they all fit their parts perfectly! The
directing is very precise and it makes me want to read the book that
the movie is based on!

My favorite scene is when they are a bit competing and there is a
montage of different cooks/chefs from the two restaurants cooking
pretty and yummy looking food. It shows you that, even though both
restaurants are very different, both can make excellent food! It made
me hungry and I swear I could smell it at times.

This movie has some adult oriented references and also some scenes
little children won't understand so a good age rating is 8 to 18. I
also give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic directing, cast,
editing, ideas, and of course producing!

6578724,4,B00MI56U6S,"-- even if it starts that way.

Indian immigrants open their own restaurant across the street from a Michelin-rated French restaurant - and in France, no less. Not just business competitors, this turns into a real clash of cultures. The writers even touch on the ugly side of xenophobia: the vile grafitti and fire-bombings. Buying up crucial ingredients at the market, blocking the competitor from getting them, is one thing. But, when it turns violent, even the French purist in charge of one establishment says that's too much.

Add in sort of a Romeo and Juliet love interest - that makes the eventual happy ending that much happier. This isn't the raw overload of food scenes that some foodie flicks offer, but a charming parable about living together and living (and eating) better because of it. Very enjoyable.

6578725,5,B00MI56U6S,"This is a charming and delightful movie, sensitively and observantly directed by Lasse (Chocolat) Hallstrom.

It was filmed in the south west of France, with gorgeous locations including a charming village: Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val.

The artistic design of the film is superb, with excellent attention to detail, capturing the essence of la belle France. Ms Mirren's and Ms Le Bon's costumes are particularly stylish and chic.

What is the story about?

In a village in France, there's a famous - and quintessentially French- Michelin star rated restaurant, owned by a perfectionist restauranteur. A refugee Indian family arrives in the village, and they open the ""Maison Mumbai"" restaurant across the road.

From there, it's a tale mixing ingredients of romance, ambition, rivalry, bigotry, triumph over adversity, tolerance and acceptance.

The themes are presented with sensitivity, light humor, and a delightful charm. The humor, drama, gentle romance and serious messages are expertly blended.

Interspersed with this is gorgeous food- from the beautiful fresh produce at the local market to the magnificent culinary presentations befitting a Michelin rated restaurant.

The cast is uniformly excellent.

This is a delightful movie, with a subtle charm which draws you into the story- you care about the characters and what happens to them.

Observant viewers may note some blurring of the time period in which the story is set- I suggest you just go along with the director on the journey and enjoy the experience!

6578726,3,B00MI56U6S,"Differing cultures can cause any manner of conflict, but one thing we can all agree on is good food. Right? Well, of course not. We live in a country where Philadelphians fight over which cheesesteak is best, so imagine that warring taken to an international level. The Hundred-Foot Journey follows just such a war in the clashing of French and Indian cuisines, which couldn't possibly be more different. French food is decadent yet subtle, while Indian cooking emphasizes an abundance of spicy flavors. Despite the gorgeous pictorial setting and luxuriating food porn that will have your mouth watering, the film is in desperate need of additional seasoning.

Based on the best-selling novel by Richard C. Morais, the high-profile ingredients making up this meal are producers Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, whose mandate to Chocolat director Lasse Hallstrom must have been to stick with the easy-going, approachable style he's accustomed to. Resembling a Hallmark Greeting Card or something that should be on Oprah's OWN Network, the film is pleasurable enough not to offend, but lacks the spice so many of the story's characters preach about in their cooking.

The story follows a Mumbai family who uphold a vast family tradition as restaurant owners until their place is burned down during a political uprising. They are led by their stubborn Papa (Om Puri), who moves from place-to-place with little success until a fateful auto malfunction strands them in a beautiful French village. Papa, who lost his wife in the fire, believes it's a sign and decides to rebuild their restaurant. There's just one big problem: the building is directly across the street (about a hundred feet!) from Madame Mallory's (Helen Mirren) Michelin-starred establishment that serves classic French cuisine. She doesn't take kindly to the competition; Papa isn't about to back down from her; and soon a war of foodstuffs erupts.

Both sides are downright nasty, so much so that we know there can only be an eventual warming of the heart. Mallory is a lonely woman whose life is her restaurant, and she desperately wants to earn a second Michelin star. Papa believes in the ability of his talented son, Hassan (Manish Dayal), a cooking prodigy who has gained a fondness for French cuisine and Mallory's lovely sous chef, Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). Papa's restaurant, Maison Mumbai, lights up like a festival at night and plays its music too loud; Mallory is friends with the town mayor and uses the power to her advantage. The fighting is comical but lightweight until some of the townspeople, including a few of Mallory's chefs, start getting dangerously racist. When they set fire to Maison Mumbai, Hassan is injured but uses it as motivation to take his career to the next level under Mallory's guidance. She, in turn, has a change of heart about her new neighbors, although she remains a bit reluctant about their food.

Mirren makes the most of a character that is spiteful one moment then cheery the next, with little in the way of nuance in-between. She and Puri have a fun banter that goes a long way, although when romance begins to develop between them it never quite feels right. The opposite is the case between Le Bon and Dayal, who have terrific chemistry throughout. Le Bon in particular brings a perky energy as Marguerite guide's Hassan's first steps into French cuisine, and there's an interesting twist that develops as his talent overtakes hers.

There simply aren't a lot of surprises to be found on this menu. Every emotional beat is one we've seen coming a mile away, but that doesn't mean the story isn't enjoyable. Steven Knight, who has penned some wonderfully complex films (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, Locke) in the past serves up one easy culinary anecdote after another, such as ""food is memories"" which sounds profound but really isn't. What doesn't really work at all is a harsh critique on contemporary, gimmick-laden cooking as Hassan becomes a superstar chef in the big city where visual creativity always trumps passion.

Predictability aside, these are characters we come to care about and their cooking something we wish we could taste for ourselves. If only The Hundred-Foot Journey had a bit more flavor it could have been quite the savory dish.",1407369600,4,4286,5.0210970464135025

It's mostly a romance flick, served as a foodie entree, with a side dish of humor.  The plot is sometimes corny and the characters are a little too good to be true, but it's just a fun relaxing film of exactly the type I enjoy",1519776000,,356,4.220588235294118

6578794,5,B00MI56U6S,"Wow.  Hard to put into words the depth of emotion that is evoked by this film.  It is rare nowadays to see a film that does not resort to profanity, nudity or violence to get your attention.  This one uses very basic human emotions of the need for employment, a need for belonging, a need for acceptance in a strange land.  The issues of religious and racial prejudice are met face on, and we see the people that pay the price for such prejudice.  We also see courage and steadfastness, people who refuse to give up, who keep on working to fulfill their dreams, and then we see their dreams come to bear fruit.  Maybe it doesn't always end happily, but it is so much fun to see it when it does.  A real joyful experience.  Highly recommended for the whole family.",1519171200,,763,4.323943661971831

The characters were believable but fairly predictable. If you're a foodie you would probably like it better than my wife and I did. Some of the dialog was just plain difficult to understand and most of the scenes were quite dark, one so dark that for maybe 15 - 20 seconds there appeared to be only audio. It did make strong statements about tolerance and acceptance of those from other cultures.",1517184000,,544,4.3431372549019605

My three girls, (10, 8, and 4) were not excited about it at first, but once we started watching they were totally into the story,  and now they all want to learn to cook even more so than before; and are more willing to help me in the kitchen. This is a great movie for families, and the characters have personalities that are fun to watch.

6578806,5,B00MI56U6S,"Our household just finished watching this. It is certainly a heartwarming film. The passion these people have for cooking and pleasing the palates of its guests is impressive. The Owner (female) of a French, Michelin - starred restaurant is at first fearful of the new Indian restaurant which opens up close to hers. The two Owners bicker and argue over many things. The French Owner turns the Indian Restaurant Owner into the town Mayor over ridiculous infractions, some of which are not completely accurate. Over time, she becomes close to the Owner of the Indian restaurant. She also gains great respect for the Son of the Owner, who is an outstanding Chef himself, although young. She hires him for her own restaurant, teaching him more about cooking and the business. The young Chef triumphs over prejudice, being at an economic disadvantage, and other problems to become an outstanding, award-winning Chef.

Dynasty vs. dynasty, chef vs. chef, family heritage, diaspora, flavorful exhilaration of life, and taste buds. Typical from director Lassee Hallstrom in that he enjoys playing with a large cast with various side-plots, which works so well with an Indian family being dragged from their homeland to France. The influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg is very present, not simply in the style but in the parental overtones from Helen Mirren and Om Puri on their pseudo-children scattered throughout the story.",1514419200,,627,5.408163265306122

Interesting story about this movie.

I went on a first date with a guy a couple years ago before I was married and we agreed to meet at a movie theater to watch this movie. Anyways as soon as I get there, he texts me to let me know he is running a bit late. I walk into the theater room and realize that i'm the only one there!!I He was so late that I had watched the first 15 to 20 minutes in and by the time he arrived I was so hooked to this movie that we hardly talked throughout and he was obviously bothered by it. I had to politely shush him a couple times because he just did not understand why I liked this movie so much. Thing is, this movie is so good! The food, the passion, the culture and the picture! I felt like I was in the movie!

Anyways, it's definitely a must watch.",1501286400,,833,3.9464285714285716

I can understand why the critics and so many other really liked it.  The story of a young man who just wants to cook has to overcome the prejudice of a woman who owns a competing restaurant across the street from his family's restaurant.  I really don't want to tell too much and spoil it for those that have to seen it yet, but it is really a wonderful story about how opening up your mind just a little bit may not get rid of all prejudice, but may just surprise you at what you can learn about other and how one seed of kindness can grow into something magnificent.",1489017600,,678,4.082706766917293

I read the reviews on IMDB and decided to risk it for the cost on Amazon (background-we do not have cable, satellite, or watch network television but buy DVDs-we have about 1500 DVDs, and view one every night).  I hoped it would be a ""hit"" with my wife (I've had a few ""misses"" lately) but I was blown away at the story, cinematography, and emotion.  We both laughed out loud and both had tears in our eyes at different times.  While it may sound cheesy to compare to the other ""Indian-culture-meets-Western-culture"" movies (""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" franchise) this story is MORE moving and we liked it better than both of those.",1484006400,,787,4.514084507042254

6579011,5,B00MI56U6S,"Saying this movie is about cooking is like saying Lawrence of Arabia was about sand.

Yes, the theme is about chefs, and creating great dishes, and competing restaurants, and if you are a chef, or simply enjoy the delights of preparing varied and exotic dishes, you will enjoy this movie simply for its scenes in the kitchens, the spices, the dishes, and the chefs as they prepare their masterpieces.

But this movie is so much more.  It's about loss and rebuilding of lives.  It's about living in a foreign culture.  It's about competition, and in the end, cooperation and love.  It's about cultures coming together, people coming together, to celebrate food and the breaking of bread with one another.",1483920000,9,703,4.8655462184873945

 Lasse Hallstrom, Director of <CHOCOLATE><THE CIDER HOUSE RULLS><DEAR JOHN><SAFE HAVEN><HACHI> brings you the most heart worming story of a young cook from India and his family and his competitor Helen Mirren who owns a French restaurant right next to the restaurant of his fathers which ends up with all be friends. They fought to hell but after all, they became all friends. It always does. STEVEN SPIELBERG and OPRA WINFREY produced as well because they saw the beauty of this film from the beginning. Based on the amazing novel by Richard C. Morais comes this beautiful movie. I am attaching the full length film as well but the video is very bad and dark. I urge you to rent or buy again to watch the much brighter version of the movie.
 See all the clips before watching the actual feature at least to see the difference. The actual movie is 100% purely bright crispy well done cinematographed Oscar winner best cinematography qualified.
 Four main cast are so lovely.
 Helen Mirren owner of the French restaurant who discovers Manish Dayal son of Om Puri owner of the Indian restaurant and ends up with hire him, sends him to Paris to broaden him to make him more famous,..
 Manish Dayal, a genious cook descent from his mother and his father who is open minded enough to accept western ways blend it with Indian way of cooking, Falling in love with an enemy cook working for Helen Mirren, a beautiful girl Charlotte Le Bon. Eveything is so charming here.

Om Puri, who just lost his wife from India and comes to France with his whole family to open a restaurant right next to a French restaurant. A super obstinate guy, an old fashioned but somewhat romantic patriarch who ends up with falls in love with Helen Mirren.
 Charlotte Le Bon big eyed pretty girl, jealous of Manish Dayal because he is such a genius cook. She herself is a cook too so. Ends up with falls in love with him. Cure than pretty.
 You will love her too right after you see her.
 Cinematography is just stunning to look at. Its just masterpiece.
 LA LA LANDs cinematographer Linus Sandgren brings you an unforgettable beauty of cinema.
 As I said, I am attaching the full length film but I urge you to watch you the perfect version since the version that I attached is dark and very bad quality.
 And the music is Idian Bollywood based song that is more than great.

And yet it's a hard movie not to like (if you're not French). It's set in a beautiful French village, it makes the preparing and enjoying food as ravishing as Big Night or Babette's Feast, it's got a strong cast even if many of their characters are cliches, and it's so relentlessly feelgood you'd have to be an extreme curmudgeon to feel bad about watching it.

6579267,5,B00MI56U6S,"One of my current favorite movies! I just love how this movie was written, directed, and executed.
Helen Mirren is wonderful as the stuffy Madame Mallory. Om Puri, the Indian ""Papa"" and owner of the restaurant disdained by Madame Mallory, is excellent. Having never seen him in a movie before, he is totally believable and adds needed levity to many scenes.
Charlotte le Bon looks like a French china doll and is the perfect counterpoint to Manish Dayal's character.
I could go on and on...the food, the clash of culture and ideals about what makes acceptable cuisine, it all just works. Add to that the beautiful scenes of France, the exploration of grief and loss of various kinds, and the inner workings of a small town in France....and you have a movie I could watch again and again.
The ending is satisfying as endings should be. There are not too many surprises, but I don't miss them. I have no idea if the movie does the book
justice, but it stands well enough on its own!",1463875200,,980,4.573863636363637

Yes, sight unseen, as I did after reading the Amazon reviews.  The bottom line is that this is a story about love: the love of family, of place, of good food, of community, of sharing, of friends, of self, and the overcoming of the barriers borne of suspicion, prejudice and jealousy to arrive at a profound acceptance of, and love for, another.  It also is a story about courage -- the courage to take the first steps in that one hundred foot journey.  The scenery is gorgeous, the story-line is both powerful and delightful, the photography is top-notch, the music is varied and utterly pleasing and the acting so outstanding that each character is fully credible.  Helen Mirren shines, but so do each of the other actors.  Why on earth was this movie somewhat of a sleeper?!  It's simply outstanding!

Mostly, I fell for its wiles, its calculated winsomeness. It's because, ultimately, and for the most part, the movie executes well and the acting is flawless. I'm far from a foodie but I am a sucker for these sorts of movies. The juicy, adversarial interplay between two cinematic legends, Helen Mirren and Om Puri, propels this plot.

It's about an Indian family who bumbles thru Europe but at last opens an eatery in an unreceptive French village, ""unreceptive"" because perhaps the residents are of the close-minded persuasion or perhaps because Maison Mumbai situates itself right across from the village's pride and joy: the elegant, exorbitant, and conservative dining establishment, Le Saule Pleureur (The Weeping Willow). And the distance that spans the two inevitably feuding restaurants? One hundred feet.

Patrons near and far regularly flock to Le Saule Pleureur, what's widely regarded as the finest restaurant within fifty miles. Even France's own President has dined at the place. Mme. Mallory (Mirren) is the sole proprietor, all chilly personality and ambition and entitlement. Le Saule Pleureur is the recipient of the prestigious, much coveted Michelin star, except that one star isn't enough for Madame. She craves more stars.

Imagine her vexation when the rambunctious Kadam family, headed by a clamourous patriarch (Puri), buys the tumbledown building across and proceeds to found Maison Mumbai, replete with boisterous activity and festive Hindi music and, ugh, spices. Then imagine her chagrin when she samples a dish of Maison Mumbai's inexperienced young chef. Because Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) is one of them rare birds: a chef with no formal culinary training but, nevertheless, endowed with sublime, unerring instincts.

For all its unsubtle manipulation, The Hundred-Foot Journey doesn't quite achieve the heights of those other mentioned culinary movies. What makes me take points away is the unnecessary detour that comprises the film's third act. One still could've had the same exact ending without that thing that happens. And it's a bit funny that after a hundred years, the French still can't grasp the notion of spices. Too, there's the requisite (and tired) near-mystic food babble - ""You cook to make ghosts."" - that seems coded to the DNA of movies like these.

Those nitpicks aside, I liked this movie a lot. The food presentation is immaculate. The meals - from both French and Indian cuisine - look sumptuous, oh, man, so mouth-watering. The characters are immensely likable and sympathetic - and, yes, after a long minute, that also applies to Mme. Mallory. The more intense conflagration is fueled by the enmity between Mirren and Puri's bullheaded characters. But there's also heat between the unassuming Indian chef and the kind (and very lovely) French sous-chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). Of course, she would have to be employed by Mme. Mallory. I appreciate very much that the script doesn't go the usual route in that it doesn't present a white man who assimilates into a foreign culture and ends up saving the little heathens. Subversively, refreshingly, in this movie, it's the brown dude, more than anyone else, who shakes things up and saves the day, who solves the problems, who triumphs over bigotry and class prejudice.

It's a celebration of perseverance and abiding faith in family and of connections made, of relationships unexpectedly founded and cemented on sensibilities shared in common. And, omigosh, the film looks spectacular. The cinematography ensures that there is warm light always to suffuse the screen, casting a warm glow about, uplifting the spirit. See this movie for that and, also, for the two love stories, one more subtle than the other. Helen Mirren and Om Puri are brilliant, especially when they share the screen, she all sharp edges and snootiness and caustic wit, he with that bigger-than-life personality, jovial enough but not above retaliating in sabotage (well, she started it). So, yeah, go see this movie, see it with someone you like. And, then, afterwards, go somewhere fine to eat.",1453593600,,5094,6.3328530259366

I had a problem with the casting of Helen Mirren, no doubt she is a great British actress, but what exactly is she supposed to be in the film, a French woman (with a great English accent) or an English woman (with a terrible French accent?)  If the character is a French restaurant owner, then why not cast an actual French actor for that role?

The chemistry between Helen Mirren and Om Puri is outstanding.  I have watched this movie over and over again because it's simply a feel good movie everyone can enjoy, and perhaps even relate to.

When I payed $20 dollars for a ticket to this movie I felt that I had wasted it. I know they had to change the story a little to fit a 2 hour film, but it seemed like they started out following the plot of the book, the. Gave up halfway through and completely changed the entire story. The endings are different and the character relationships are not the same at all. I would recommend this movie to anyone so long as they didn't read the book. Anyone who read the book would be disappointed by this movie.

Before you watch, have ample food, wine, and a cozy blanket then journey through a classically unrealistic romantic comedy that is delicious, cute and has some fun quips and lots of luscious farmers market, chopping and cooking scenes so good you can smell it.

Don't question how realistic any of this could be...it's pure escapist enjoyment. Maybe not as much a chick flick as a Europhile foodie flick. (My favorite character was the tenacious father with attitude.) Bon appetit!",1449532800,2,560,5.086956521739131

6579584,5,B00MI56U6S,"This is an incredibly good movie with so much human interest.  The type of movie that Hollywood used to make all the time, but seems to have fallen out of favor with those who select action, violence and sex over great stories.  This is the heart warming story of a family from India who moves to France to restart the families restaurant business.  In France their restaurant goes into competition with a well-established French restaurant that is operated by Helen Mirren.  The relationships that develop and the tension between the two restaurants is the stuff that real-life stories are made of.  The acting and the photography are outstanding.  This is a ""must see"" film.",1445212800,,676,4.885964912280702

The film was highly recommended to me by someone whose judgement I trust, so I, therefore viewed it, still not expecting to like it.  Well, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this film.  It was both touching and funny, and one couldn't help routing for the underdog.  It also contained great emotional character arcs.  I highly recommend this film!",1443830400,,604,4.650943396226415

6579688,5,B00MI56U6S,"Why I paid almost $15 to Amazon last night to see this movie, when I have seen it at least twice before for $4.99, is a mystery. But a sister was here from another city and we wanted her to see it. Even at $15.00 it is a great movie and as enjoyable every time we see it.",1441065600,,271,3.689655172413793

6579690,2,B00MI56U6S,"This movie could have been so much more, given the resources, but instead it turned into a hurried dash to its predictable conclusion. The story was bland as was the acting. As a movie about food, it showed very little of it. If it was about love, I have to say it was the blandest of all love stories. Lack of direction and poor execution is evident throughout the movie which leaves a somewhat empty feeling when it finally ends. If you have to see it, lower your expectations and be willing to just donate two hours of your precious life for a few not-so-funny moments.",1441065600,,572,4.40566037735849

6579698,5,B00MI56U6S,"This was my favorite movie of 2014.  It seems the movie makers kind of ignore movie lovers of my age (60 and over).  Helen Mirren was superb, as usual, and all the actors brought their best game.  This is not a movie to watch while you're on a diet.  You need a glass of wine, some good food, and your significant other.  It's a date movie for the 40 and older crowd.",1440633600,,367,4.041666666666667

For some reason, movies with G rated content that fare well with families don't rate well with critics on an average scale, but this one does with me because it is wholesome and generates good feelings about cooking, cuisine, and the people who look at cooking as an art rather than something to stuff themselves. Fine acting, nice wonderful location, and fine cast make this worthy of family entertainment genre.",1439596800,,542,4.9021739130434785

6579751,4,B00MI56U6S,"Love this film.  Even more than the book.  Especially more than the book.

Hassan/Manish Dayal's journey is intriguing.  His mother is an expert cook, seeking the best ingredients, but she is killed in a terrible ethnic riot, and the family restaurant is destroyed.

The family travels to England, where his family finds the vegetables tepid, so they move to France and garner the ire of Madame Mallory.

Madame Mallory is played by the impeccable Helen Mirren, who owns ""Le Saule Pleureur"" a Michelin star restaurant.  She resents the presence of the family, and scoffs at the competition.  But she proves her worth when she goes out scrubbing racial slurs that her head chef scrawled on her neighbor's gate.

Hassan is a star, and Madame Mallory recognizes his talents.  She wants him to study, specifically to study with her, and Hassan is already in love with Madame Mallory's chef de cuisine.  Marguerite is good-hearted, innocent, sweet, and earnest, and she is played by the luminous Charlotte Le Bon.

Again, I like the film more than the book.  Helen Mirren brought to life the rigid, but passionate Madame Mallory, and the film etched the personalities of Hassan's family and especially his boisterous obstinate father.

I understand Hassan's despondency, and his plight was more sympathetic than the book's tedious points about the restaurant business.

Like the film's ending even.  It all made sense.  A wondrous, lovely, entertaining film.",1438646400,,1453,5.114893617021276

6579816,5,B00MI56U6S,"Borrowed this from our library after seeing a promo for it in Nevada last year.  I see a few ? critical ? reviews on the internet and think these people couldn't tell the difference between chicken poop and an elegant dinner. You cannot make a great movie unless you have a great story. This is why badly written (or no) stories fail when you attempt to film them.

This is a well written story !  All the actors are great. I lived 4 years in France, learning French and four years in Quebec with my wife and family. The French cuisine parts are so professional and echo current television cuisine shows airing in Quebec.

What are the critics looking for ? Is someone supposed to turn psycho and perform a mass killing ?

It is a beautiful story, well told, and I will buy it because it is one of the few DVD movies I would put in a home library. My wife is French Canadian and the second I heard Charlotte Le Bon talk in English, I knew that her accent in English sounds just like my French Canadian niece in Gatineau, Quebec. (I was right !)

6579841,5,B00MI56U6S,"Intimate without being vulgar, passionate without being mushy, exciting and family-friendly with an extra side of humor, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a delightful and expressive film about, well, the ""human-ness"" of humanity. Helen Mirren does a fabulous job as the French proprietor of a traditional restaurant with a Michelin star (a badge of prestige), and the scrappy, entrepreneurial family -- but interestingly, not any less traditional if viewed in the correct context -- that fatefully starts a restaurant across the street. The entire cast has great chemistry, making this a fun watch. ""Sense-ational"" food provides the backdrop for competition, conflict, Pyrrhic victory, and satisfying resolution. I recommend this without reservation.",1435968000,,745,5.781818181818182

6579982,5,B00MI56U6S,"It is always interesting to see the range of opinions expressed by the reviewers; as usual, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My wife and I watched this movie this evening for the first time and were totally delighted by it. Of course we are both in love with ""Enchanted April"" and if you liked that one I suspect you'll like this one too.

The story is well paced and starts with a bang in India with an attack on an Indian's families restaurant. This drives them out of India and they eventually wind up in a village in France because of a mechanical problem with their transportation. The rest of  the movie is about their efforts to make a place for themselves in the French environment.

The characters are well cast and come across as sympathetic and it becomes very easy to care about what happens to them. The movie ends on a high note and leaves the viewer feelling glad they watched the movie. The scenery is beautiful, the acting is excellent and the whole experience leaves one feeling better about themselves and the world.

6580013,4,B00MI56U6S,"This improbable feel-good film from the director of my Life As A Dog may be schmaltzy and cheesy.  However it is in a satisfying delicious way if one can withhold one's logical mind.

The chance that an Indian family of six could even get into France and get permits to open a restaurant in a small provincial town in the 1960's: well, right off the bat we have to suspend disbelief.  Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey wanted to make this a film about tolerance, so the idea of a dark Muslim family from Bombay getting accepted by snooty French cuisine connisseurs in a very out of the way town was created.

If you look up the origin of this idea, it came from a detailed novel by journalist Mourais, a Portuguese-British well renowned writer.  He got the idea over ten euars ago on the island of Guernsey when he saw an Indian restaurant there opposite a staid and old fashioned English high level restaurant.  Now that would make sense that Indians would live in England.

The French villagers are not seen in any great number at all except the employees of the french restaurant across the street where they open Maison Mumbai.  There is the very closed minded proprietress played by Helen Mirren who is 69 in this film.  There is her sous chef a cheerful yet serious young cook who plays a cute love interest for the new young Indian Hassanacross the street.  Where is the real outcry against this loud and very spicy place?

The Indian family themselves are shown to be quite intolerant towards French food. Bthey are not enamoired of the language or culture nor do the Children appear to attend school or make friends with French children.  They stay to themselves a and all work in the restaurant.  The son Hassan is the gifted one who really can taste and smell ingredients to perfection. Indian spices were smuggled in by suitcase and are used liberally.

The father of the family is an old fellow widowed by a political attack back in Mumbai which killed his wife and sent the family packing for England.  Then France when the food was tasteless and the rain relentless.  He Carries this film with his firm views about life and people and food and business.  He is a joy to behold on screen, a true actor.

I can say that I did enjoy this fluffy bit of cross cultural antagonisms.  However I hate the idea that there has to be an agenda to it about racist Europeans.  If racism is so terrible in Europe , why would this family or any other go near Thr place?  It is India with its myriads of cultures and language a and religions which is bursting with violence and intolerance and always has been in spite of the unification through British rule and English language government.

Well think of this as 'Chocolat'-with curry. You will enjoy it, though the storyline is rather predictable and you might miss not having more humor. So more of a love story, in every sense, than a 'ha-ha' comedy. I have a longer review in my blog at:

6580080,5,B00MI56U6S,"To date I have now seen this movie twice and could probably see it a third time.  Originally I was dragged into the movie theater by my husband and thought this would be a boring film.  It was far from that.  It was uplifting, funny at times, touching and most of all refreshing.  These days it seems like the majority of successful movies are all about violence with little story.  To have a movie that is not only story based, but written in an entertaining manner with a good script, was such a delight.  They just don't make many movies like this these days. Some fun facts. After the movie my husband and I crossed the street to our favorite Indian restaurant to celebrate the deeper understanding of Indian spices we got from this dish. Weeks later, we ended up at a ""fusion"" restaurant in Palm Springs, CA. (I live near Santa Barbara), mainly because of this film because it celebrates ""fusion"" cooking.  To our amazement, the chef at this restaurant was considered one of the best in the world.  The two of us spent the night in awe of what was entering our mouths.  But, best of all a few months later, I went up the Central California Coast to get away on a mini vacation and ended up in a restaurant at one of the nicer hotels up by Shell Beach and had an omelet that was nothing like I ever had before in my entire life. It was so light, fluffy, and mouth watering. I finally began to understand what really good cooking is all about, which this film reflects, and why Helen Mirren's character makes such a big deal about a good omelet.  Overall, a really great film.",1432252800,,1579,4.376712328767123

It was one of those films which delights, touches, inspires. Such films aren't always blockbusters, or deeply significant, or earnest Oscar contenders; sometimes they just hit the spot. What spot?

6580269,5,B00MI56U6S,"Before settling to watch ""Journey,""  I made a tomato soup with carrots, cauliflower, chicken, olives, olive juice, basil, thyme, and oregano.  I had purchased some good bread, and lightly buttered it.  Then I sat ate and watched this delightful movie, I am in Los Angeles, and it has been a moderately rainy day.  I watch the movie while enjoying my soup and bread, with candles lit around my computer that is showing me this wonderful movie.  My senses are seduced by my meal, the lights of the late afternoon/evening of my Los Angeles rainy day, and I am filled with glowing feelings of contentment, warmth, and comfort.  This is a wonderful movie.  It almost jumps out of the screen with the sights of the settings, the voices, eyes, and presence of the actors.  You see and feel India, France.  You taste curry and bechamel sauce.  You are delighted by the magnetizing characterizations of the actors.  It just lulls you into a state of bliss.  I saw this movie for the first time at a movie theater, and left it feeling delighted, contented, and wanting to go home and cook.  Today, at home with the rain falling, the silver-grey of the sky, the moment when the rain stopped and light golden rays moved through my windows, the continuous rendering of scenes with images of foods that synesthetically leaped from the screen, the mixture of sensuous France and India, me on my sofa wrapped in a blanket, was nothing short of bliss, just beautiful, perfect bliss.
Can you tell I liked it?",1429920000,,1490,4.684615384615385

6580274,4,B00MI56U6S,"We rented ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" for a family movie night, and we weren't disappointed. Of course, we LOVE Indian food, which is a central element of the movie, so that didn't hurt our perception of it any.  But the movie presented both its humorous and dramatic elements very well, and along the way conveyed lessons regarding the harmful nature of prejudice and violence, as well as what constitutes true ""success"" in life.  I'd recommend it as both entertaining and edifying -- too rare a combination!",1429920000,,508,4.964705882352941

This movie kept our attention and our emotions on high alert.  We love Helen Mirren and have many of her movies including the PBS DVDs.

6580285,3,B00MI56U6S,"I love Bollywood and Indian food. I love French film and food and have lived there.  The HFJ has nothing but potential. Instead, it tries so hard to be charming, but is so contrived and false it makes you cringe, as if the film-makers either have no confidence in their story, or no talent. Sorry. Not to be harsh, but if Fellini or De Sica had made this film it could have been magical.

Let me give you an example. It's not a great example, but will suffice for my point.  ""Paris, Texas"" (Nastasia Kinski, Harry Dean Stanton) in every frame has German director Wim Wendors looking at America through German, or at least European eyes. He (and thus his camera) sees things Americans can't see. That's what this film needs, eyes that see the magic and can communicate that to us.

And who cast Helen Mirren? One dimensional would be a compliment. I would have cast Deneuve, or Nathalie Baye, or Adjani, if you wanted a true prima donna.

I really, really wanted to like this film. It has a few moments. Watch it for the scenery. It looks like a beautifully plated dish that you can't eat.",1429833600,,1088,4.447236180904523

The entire family from India is willing to settle just in front of a famed French Restaurant owner of a Michelin star.

This curious contrast will make both sides make a sane competence to capture the favor of their clients, until a firm resolution will make the rest. Lasse Halstrom (Hachiko, My life as a dog and Chocolat, has captured the rest of the world with his imaginative artistic proposals. Helen Mirren - marvelous and talented as always- makes a terrific tour de force acting in this charming picture.

A marvelous journey to the universe of creative dishes, wonderful presence and captivating presence.

6580495,5,B00MI56U6S,"Reviews said this was a good movie.  After seeing it, I can say it is a great movie.  Rather slow moving but carefully building to several climaxes.  The title has many meanings, not apparent in the beginning.  The Indian scenes are authentic (I lived in India for a few months).  The gradual accommodation by each other of Indian and French people and their sensitivities left one in the end with a very good feeling for the future of humankind.",1427932800,,446,4.594936708860759

A hard working chef from a hard working Indian family is invited across the street to a pricey french stuck up, unfriendly, well known establishment to cook for them and he accepts! Really? Deserts his family restaurant to help ""the enemy"" , earns a michelin star for the french and the family is happy? for him?? While the Indian restaurant faulters no less.
This movie made no sense to me. Looks like Oprah and Steven were just looking for ""feel good"" moments to create a movie around but forgot about the connections. Stau-pa-id!",1427932800,4,557,4.6938775510204085

No surprises to speak of, and the whole project had a phony feel to it.  I wondered too, with these restaurants (across an unconvincing-looking road) that were miles away from the town:  Where did the people walking by come from?  There's nothing there. Also, where did their customers park?  And don't get me started on the scene with the kid directing Ms. Mirren how to make an omelet.",1427241600,3,496,4.788235294117647

6580712,2,B00MI56U6S,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, having read the novel, being passionate about food and hoping that the director would stuck to the storyline.
Unfortunately, the screenplay pretty much scrapped the original story, just taking the main characters and basic skeleton of the plot and turning it into a fluff version of the novel. I tried to watch it as a separate entity, but the changes irritated me too much. I love Helen Mirren as an actress, but I feel the watered down version of Madame that they wrote for her kept her from being able to show the depth I know she can play. I felt they found the right actor for Hassan, but again, didn't feel his story of culinary training shined through. There were many other cultural inconsistencies in the film that were upsetting, as I can see Indians and French alike scoffing at or being offended by some of the screenplay's details. Suspension of disbelief here was difficult. Why would Hassan serve beef to his Indian dad?? Considering cows are the most sacred of animals in India, I was shocked that even the actors didn't give an objection to request a different dish. As for Hassan, he had to work his way up in the kitchen of Madame, as any chef in France would have to. Regardless of his talent, this would have been a requirement, as there is more to cooking in restaurant than pure natural culinary skill. There are so many other MAJOR plot differences that I won't mention them here and instead, encourage you to read the book.",1426377600,5,1491,4.588014981273409

It's a typical premise with rivalry between 2 restaurants and the outcome is obvious way before the end, but Mirren plays her part to perfection and the overall movie was charming.  As you would expect, the food presentation is excellent and you'll be wanting a dish of Indian food before it's over.

This movie is put out by Oprah.  I think this is the 3rd surprisingly good movie she has put out.  Surprisingly good because her ""acting"" was atrocious in Selma but her movies Selma, 12 Years, and Hundred--foot have been super.

6580897,3,B00MI56U6S,"After viewing it, I believe this movie was very overrated.  Helen Mirren is a great actress, but she mails it in for this movie.  That's not the worst of it, though, it is just that this is an ok movie but not a remarkable movie.  It can't decide what it's about (is it about the father? the son? the village? the sexy girl from the village?).  It sort of tries to be about all of them.  I particularly dislike the way it deals with the racist attack on the Indian restaurant.  The attack as depicted in the movie is nothing short of a terrorist act, and it justified a severe response from the authorities.  In the movie, it's just a plot device, and does not receive the attention an actual attack of this sort would.  I hate it when movie makers treat me like I'm stupid.",1425254400,2,774,4.2534246575342465

6580913,5,B00MI56U6S,"It was bound to happen, no question, once the film industry caught up to this cycles uptick in peoples quests for all things culinary. Earlier this year I reviewed Chef, a story about a rags-to-riches latest trend food truck operator. In the film under review here, The Hundred-Foot Journey, we actually take a few steps back to the fight between the old-fashioned standard high-side French cuisine getting mixed in with a multicultural twist ancient India food made from hand-down to hand-down forbear memory in two restaurants in modern day France. (That hundred-foot in the title being literally true since the two restaurants are that far across the road from each other). Oh yeah, and mixed in with the battle of the cuisines is, well, the battle of the sexes, the also old-fashioned love story, or better stories.

Here is how the love of food played out with love all mixed up like a garden salad (nice metaphor here right) topped off by the modern multicultural tolerance message. The restaurant-owning Kadam family, mostly importantly for the film, Papa (played by Om Puri) and Hassam who is being groomed as the next generation family chef (played by Manish Dayal) had been run out of India when the political winds shifted and wound up in asylum exile first in England where they could not make a go of it there then to France where they, mainly Papa decided to make a last stand to re-start his restaurant business in a small village. Decided to bring the ancient Indian cuisine to the peasantry so to speak. Problem One. French people (and others) as is well known like, really like French cuisine, actually look down in pity at the rest of the world and its hot dogs and hamburgers tastes, and the chances that they will go for Indian food seems remote. Problem Two. There is already a very fine French one-star, and eventually two-star, Michelin restaurant right across the street from their proposed site run by a Type-A owner, Madame Malloy (played by Helen Mirren who used to be Queen Elizabeth I when last seen in these precincts). So there was going to be a war between these two immovable objects who will fight just like McDonalds and Burger King for market share. This has all the making a drag down fight to the finish.

Well not exactly to the finish because then the cross-culinary mix gets mixed in with love interests, the first part between Hassam who is nothing by a genius chef in-waiting and an employee of Madame Malloy, Marguerite (played by Charlotte LeBon) who has her own dreams of being a master chef and the second part, once they get to know each other a little between Madame and Papa if you can believe that.
Here how where the ice got thawed.  Hassam wanted to see if he could make it in the high-end world of French cuisine since that is the standard in the industry so after the Indian restaurant established itself through Papas winning ways and after a few tense moments (brought on by Madames fears about her place) he becomes an apprentice chef at Madames place alongside Marguerite.

Naturally since Hassam has been nurtured in the spice world of Indian food and is inventive enough to bring off combining aspects of the two cuisines he is acknowledged as the king hell king chef before long. Topped off by bringing Madame that second Michelin star she has craved for many years. But small town France is not where Hassam can make his mark to do that he needs the competitive edge of Paris to see how good he can be. Of course that will put a big crimp in the affair with Marguerite but Hassam must follow his stars. And he does set all of Paris on fire with his innovative touches. That however does not make him happy because he is missing something-missing his Marguerite. So he decides to goes back for his fellow chef and life in the village. Of course that other love interest between Papa and Madame had unfolded along the way and so alls well that ends well. Especially since Hassam and Marguerite are going to run Madames restaurant and get it up to Michelin three-star speed. A funny look at multiculturalism, the world of the kitchen and the inevitable girl-boy thing that drives most films. Enough said.",1425168000,,4165,4.670299727520436

6580984,4,B00MI56U6S,"Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom has made a series warm, cuddly films over his career.  Films like ""The Cider House Rules,"" ""Chocolat,""""Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"" and ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" come to mind.  I enjoyed them all, but at the same time there is nothing profound or even memorable about them with the possible exception of the Oscar nominated ""Chocolat.""  This film fits the category, broad though it may be.

Helen Mirren is the big name here and she's terrific as Madame Mallory, a widowed proprietress of a well-known Michelin, one-star restaurant located in the French countryside.  A family of Indian migrs comes to her small town, having given up on their restaurant business in their native country.  In an opening scene, we know the restaurant was pillaged and burned by some kind of protestors, but the overriding rationale is never explained.

The family is led by Papa (Om Puri), having lost his wife in the fire.  The family includes 5 children, ranging in age from the 20-something Hassan (Manish Dayal) to a girl of about 10.  Papa decides to buy a run-down former restaurant across the small road from the famed French restaurant.  Hassan meets cute with Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), an up-and-coming sous chef in Mallory's kitchen.  After some renovations, Papa and his family open Maison Mumbai, which features Indian cuisine.  Madame Mallory is no fan of the competition, but is more flummoxed by the music and the cultural invasion.  Hassan, is a brilliant cook in his own right and eventually convinces Mallory to hire him, much to the dismay of his family and Marguerite.  Even the reluctant Mallory agrees that his cooking has something she has been missing and damn, she wants that second Michelin star.

Like many dramedies like this, we can see where the story is going to go from the first act.  There are no real surprises but I have to say I enjoyed the journey.  Certainly the mixture of the food preparation and the chemistry between the cultures provides and easy to swallow visual feast.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was shot on 35mm film, a rarity these days and it looks very natural.  There are occasions when CGI inserts are used.  My guess is that even the restaurant exteriors were digital.  Certainly when the fireworks go off (2 or 3 times), it looks a bit artificial.  Still, the detail is excellent, flesh-tones are authentic and the colors are terrific.  The wonderful cinematography of the French landscapes, the local farmer's markets and the food preparation are exceptional.  Audio comes in the form of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is equally excellent.  Fully immersive, the surrounds are often in play with various ambient noises from the restaurants, the aforementioned marketplace and interiors.  The dialog is clear and well positioned.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a discussion with producers Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, a behind the scenes look, another piece called ""On Set with Oprah Winfrey"" (4 minutes) and a guide to making Coconut Chicken.",1424908800,,3149,4.9674952198852775

6581193,4,B00MI56U6S,"Disclaimer -- ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is not my usual type of movie.  My tastes in cinema tend to run more towards action/sci-fi films, animated movies, and older comedies (think ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" or ""Blues Brothers"") than slower dramas or slice-of-life films.  And the fact that it was based on a book initially made me avoid it, as I usually prefer to read the book before I see the adaptation.  But after hearing good things about the film, I decided to give it a chance, and borrowed it from Redbox for a night.

I'm glad I gave this film a chance.  While it's fairly predictable and the obligatory romance feels tacked on, it's a thoughtful and heartwarming movie, with an exceptional cast.

""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" focuses on Hassan Kadam, a young Indian man whose family operates a popular restaurant in Mumbai, India... until a post-election riot destroys their restaurant and kills his mother.  The family relocates to Europe, and eventually his father decides to try their luck again by buying and renovating an abandoned restaurant in a French village.  The problem -- said restaurant is right across the road from an upscale, Michelin-Star-rated restaurant run by the ambitious Mallory, who is out to secure another star for her restaurant and goes to great (and occasionally unethical) lengths to sabotage the success of the Kadam's restaurant.  But when one of her own staff goes too far, she strives to reconcile with the family, even inviting the talented Hassan to study under her tutelage when she recognizes his skill in the kitchen.  Hassan quickly becomes a rising star in the culinary world, but fame comes at a price, and he must decide which is more important -- another Michelin star, or his family and relationships back home.

The film has been described as ""Slumdog Millionaire meets Ratatouille,"" and while it's nowhere near as bleak and violent as the former and not as cutesy as the latter, it's an apt description.  ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" deftly mixes the story of the Kadam family struggling to find their place in an unfamiliar country with the visual feast of the kitchen.  The film doesn't shy away from the racism and ugly reactions to the ""intrusion"" of Hassan's family, but it doesn't wallow in the characters' misery either -- the characters manage to pick themselves up and keep going in the face of adversity, which is heartening.  Many movies tend to linger on the characters' suffering or just pile on one misery after another in an effort to be ""dramatic,"" and this gets painful to watch after awhile, so it was nice to see ""Hundred-Foot Journey"" not falling into the same trap.

The actors in this film range from competent to excellent.  Manish Dayal is curiously bland as Hassan, but he gets the job done, while Charlotte Le Bon feels oddly superfluous as Marguerite, Mallory's sous chef and Hassan's unofficial tutor/rival/love interest.  Likewise, their romance feels shoehorned into the film, largely unnecessary to the film as a whole.  In contrast, the spirited bickering, bullheadedness, and eventual friendship between Mallory (played with gusto and elegance by Hellen Mirren, who's quickly becoming a favorite actress) and Papa Kadam (played by Om Puri) was far more entertaining to watch, and both actors did a fantastic job in their roles.  Papa Kadam in particular is fun to watch -- the perfect blend of stubborn humor and fatherly concern.

While not a masterpiece or Oscar contender, ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is a heartwarming film that's the cinematic equivalent of comfort food -- a feel-good movie about good people overcoming obstacles to do good and improve themselves, and discover what's most important.  It's a good film, one I'm glad I ventured out of my comfort zone to see.",1424217600,,3767,5.0048076923076925

6581205,2,B00MI56U6S,"WARNING: I am absolutely in the minority on this movie so bear with me... Also probably some **SPOILERS** ahead...

I saw the movie 'Chef' recently and absolutely loved it. Very cute/light hearted/fun.

I expected this movie to be like that and it absolutely wasn't.

This movie was weird... it had a really weird/frenetic/confused energy to it.

Here is a super poor/down on their luck Indian family coming to France. Yay, quirky personalities abound and bull-headed 'papa' opens a restaurant for family.

(Ok, I can get into this, light hearted and funny, just lose myself in the quirky stuff, not a problem!)

Ok then culinary genius son and good looking sous chef next door are interested in eachother and she tells him what it takes to get a job at the Michelin-starred restaurant she works out across the street.

(Ok, so they are going to have a romance and I am sure the stuffy lady next door and bull headed dad will make it funny)

TWIST - The culinary genius son burns his hands, is a douchebag and in a too-sacrine-to-swallow scene, with his hands all wrapped up, walks the stuffy owner next door through making herself the worlds most unforgivably delicious omelet in slow motion... so then she asks that he comes and studies in her kitchen (across the street).

WEIRD - So once the pretty sous chef next door finds out that he used her inside scoop on the omelet test to get in, there is this SUPER WEIRD romantic scene where they are trying to kiss, but she is like pushing him away and then scratches his burnt hands as a giant 'F-U!' to him for what he's done and he is acting super confused about his round-about on supplanting her at her own restaurant would make her angry... it's really stupid/strange and had a very overly aggressive energy for a movie that was suppose to be light hearted...

So then he goes next door, they hate each other, and he becomes the greatest chef ever.

WEIRD x2 - So then he is picked up by the ultra-elite-rediculous restauraunteer's from London to come and make really crazy over-the-top dishes and 'push the envelope of food'. So he does this and becomes this ROCK STAR, world-renouned, television/playboy chef -- why the hell is this 'hero journey' segment in here? He's not this admirable guy either, he's just this douchey rockstar chef guy this entire time.

OH BUT WAIT, this is a romantic movie, we forgot, so after a year or something of doing this he realizes his life is empty.

WEIRD x3 - So now rock-star, globally-recognized TV personality chef guy comes back to small toy in France and stands outside the old sous chef window and proclaims how he is coming back to that restaurant to make things with her cause they are inlove... what the hell? There has been no relationship building up until now... and this clown ""loves her"" and she ""loves him""?

Cool, I guess I love my mailman too because I've seen him deliver the mail a handful of times.

WEIRD x4 - Anyway, so they of course do it, you know, because he's been back in town for 18mins and last time they saw each other she sort of hated him - but there has to be the obligatory 'proclamation of love' scene or something... I don't know... and they go back to the fancy restaurant and everyone cries because it is so amazing that they are going to come back and cook together and work on the 3rd Michelin star together.

-------------------------------

This is a typical 'hero's journey' + 'romance' movie, but it is told in such a forced way with an unfolding of events that just don't make sense and are following a recipe but not quite put together correctly.

The two main characters also have next to no chemistry between each other.

Like I said, I'm in the minority... I thought this movie was the right story, told absolutely the wrong way with unlikeable characters and an unlikeable journey.",1424044800,9,3826,4.608247422680412

The hundred foot journey is a tale about a young Indian child who has a gift for food and cooking. He is taught the basics by his mother, who is tragically killed during a raid at their restaurant. The father of the family moves everyone to France in search of safety and a new location to restart their business. The location they pick happens to be right across the street from an exclusive, one star restaurant (3 being the best).

As you can imagine, they are not welcomed very warmly. However, the son is determined to make his mother proud and carry on the legacy of his heritage. He takes to studying classic French cooking and eventually begins dabbling in fusion dishes. Afraid that he has outgrown his family's restaurant, he takes a job at the 1 star restaurant across the street, much to his father's dismay. After a while things turn out well as he helps the restaurant earn a 2 star rating.

From that point on he is a highly sought after chef with the ability to command any kitchen he desires. He takes a job in a gastropub and begins working his magic once again, although far away from his beginnings. He realizes there is more to life, and cooking, than simply being the very best. What good is being number one if you need to abandon everything else trying to achieve it? He decides to return to his small two restaurants in search of his elusive third star. This decision allows him to rejoin his family, the love of his life, and the passion for cooking he so strongly cultivated for many, many years.",1423267200,,1572,4.508771929824562

However, I was captivated after the first 5 minutes (that part of the movie is a bit confusing because it has an Indian family trying to set up a new restaurant in several places before stopping in a small French town). It could have been sentimental rubbish because you can almost predict what it going to happen. However, the comments on food and the process of cooking are a delight in itselves. If the obvious romance(s) bother you, fast forward but stop during the cooking sections. I do cook with spices, including Indian spices, and I pulled those out the next day to cook with an Indian type dish. The rest of the actors are good and the scenery is lovely.

6581329,3,B00MI56U6S,"The movie follows the story of a family driven from Mumbai to opening a restaurant in the South of France opposite a existing Michelin-star eatery. The plot covers some expected ground - the resistance of the existing restaurant owner (Mirren), the reluctance of rural France (or rural anywhere, really) to accept newcomers and change. It's no doubt charming, picturesque and inoffensive, and let's Mirren showcase her craft while teaching the audience to embrace the new.

While THFJ is enjoyable, it's a somewhat vapid feel-good experience that you'll forget the moment it's over. Never edgy enough to really create conflict, the film is happy to touch the boundaries of drama but then recoil back into some really good food. We get a beautiful tour of the South of France and there's enough cooking to run this as a Food Network special, but there's no central story to bind it all together.

Structurally, it's just not a solid film, starting in one direction and then changing course mid-way through. Compared with the carefully-plotted Ratatouille which is fundamentally the same story (""a great chef can come from anywhere""), this film wastes time on the ultimately irrelevant construction of the new restaurant and never lets us explore or understand the characters. Whereas Pixar would catch this early on in storyboarding, Lasse Hallstrom makes his trademark move of letting feel-good fluff get in the way of the characters, so the longer it goes on the more unstable it gets.

That all said, Helen Mirren and Om Puri keep this ship afloat and it's pleasant enough to spend a couple of hours watching a story that isn't about superheroes. Despite immediately wanting to eat Indian food, I just wish it had been better.",1422144000,2,1728,5.013937282229965

A family from India opens an Indian restaurant in France, vis-&agrave;-vis a French restaurant, which leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the owner of the French restaurant, superbly played by Helen Mirren.

The cast is excellent and the actor of Hassan is amazing .... and Om Puri, who performs the Indian father, as well ...Charlotte Le Bon is a Bonbon :. )

and while watching you think you taste and smell everthing, which is cooked ... not only some meals overboil, also the emotions within this movie-masterpiece ...

a movie for eyes and soul, a feast for sights, sounds and tastes, for all senses !

6581351,5,B00MI56U6S,Outstanding movie.  The story centers around Hasan Kadam (Manish Dayal) and his passion for French cuisine.  Hasan's passion comes across as quite believable--one can imagine you are cooking next to him as he prepares traditional French dishes then dares to introduce changes...  Helen Mirren is the ultimate bitter French woman who in the end is surprisingly won over by the new Indian neighbors 100' across the road from her Michelin 1 star French restaurant.

The story, which follows an immigrant family from India to France and focusing mainly on the conflict between the Indian family's new Indian Food restaurant and Helen Mirren's established fine French dining restaurant, has enough interest to make the film fun as it builds towards an inevitable positive resolution.

With a PG rating comes a thick coat of gloss over the ""issues"" that are presented to move the story forward, but it is not so thick that these parts of the story seem unrealistic or superfluous.

I would recommend this as a great movie for couples looking for something heartwarming and a little romantic. I think it would be suitable for grade school aged children as well, if you wanted to watch it as a family movie pick.",1421798400,,916,4.791139240506329

6581373,1,B00MI56U6S,This is complete rubbish. Does not qualify as a movie. Maybe a bad college experiment for a young director. Anyone with half a brain and attention to details will be in physical pain watching this train wreck.,1421625600,6,209,4.675675675675675

6581379,2,B00MI56U6S,"Long, boring, forced, unfunny. I wish it was just one (or none) of those adjectives describing this movie but, unfortunately, they all do. This is another movie from this director with forced acting, awkward and humorless moments, and a drawn out story line. It's surprising to see the talent of so many people, mainly the actors, go totally to waste.

I rented this movie for a few simple reasons: I wanted to see a movie with some great actors and a family friendly storyline. The movie totally failed and turned into 2+ hours of bad taste.",1421539200,3,542,4.645833333333333

6581442,2,B00MI56U6S,"I kind of love how Lasse Hallstrom has this reputation in Hollywood as being kind of, well, cloying.  His name pops up and a lot of my cinephile friends scoff and groan about how bad this movie is going to be.  While Ive never found his films truly awful, I can get understand the feelings of my friends, simply because his filmography is cluttered with films that feel like dumbed down Oscar bait.  There is never really anything truly challenging about his films.  Whats Eating Gilbert Grape is earnest when necessary, but otherwise stagnant.  The Cider House Rules is almost too glossy for its own good.  Chocolat is just kind of silly, pretty and entertaining, but silly.  Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was touching but forgettable and then he went all Nicholas Sparks (TWICE) and I found myself wondering what exactly happened to him.  Was he even trying anymore?

And this is the guy who, back in 1987, delivered one of my FAVORITE movies of all time; My Life as a Dog.  Where is THAT guy?

So, here we are, 2014, and were given some more food porn, except this time around it is in France with the lovely (and awfully snooty) Helen Miren and a family of stubborn (but, well, isn't everyone) Indian immigrants who are seeking some sort of rebirth in the wake of a tragic loss.  The problem is, the posh surroundings and loyal neighbors are not accustomed to the bold, rich flavors of Indian cuisine, nor do they desire to embrace their colorful and flamboyant culture.  Instead, they skip their restaurant for the more established and societally acceptable Michelin-studded restaurant across the street.  Run by the cold and malicious Madame Mallory, young Hassan and his father have their work cut out for them, but they are determined souls, and Hassan is undeniably talented.

And then a lot of stuff happens, none of which is all that interesting, and then more stuff happens, and just when you think the film is coming to a close you find that youve been duped, and the story is not over and the climax you thought they were building for wasn't really the climax at all and you have to stay awake for another twenty minutes, or longer, before you can finally say, oh, its over now.

The problem with The Hundred-Foot Journey is that is literally feels like you are taking that long of a journey just to get to the finale, and the payoff is nothing all that inspired.  This is one of those slow brooding movies with no real flash of light to keep us wanting more.  Sure, the scenery is pretty, and Mirren is queen of a sexy snarl, and some of the food (when we see the food) is appetizing, but in a year that brought us Chef, you really have to do better than this.  Its just so painfully dull.  The segment where Hassan leaves for life as a celebrity chef, or sorts, felt so out of place and tagged on, and the film really felt like it was going to end when he went to work for Madame Mallory, but it didntit kept going and going and going.  Maybe if any of these characters were remotely interesting, but other than Charlotte Le Bon being beautiful and Om Puri being a funny, albeit hugely stereotypical, stubborn old man, these characters brought nothing to the story, or maybe its that the story gave us no real characters.

Over long, underdeveloped, and overall just there, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a journey you may want to avoid.",1421020800,4,3348,4.554257095158597

6581473,5,B00MI56U6S,"When Hassan, the eldest son and ""crown prince"" of the Indian restaurant, tells a border patrol agent about his experience in cuisine, he simply says ""My mother taught me everything."" In India, such explanations may be acceptable, but in western cultures, such pronouncements seem irrelevant. These are the kinds of distances explored in ""The 100-Foot Journey"". When we consider the ""distance"" between cultures and class, we often think of these distances in physical terms. India is many thousands of miles from France. Russia and China are nearly half-a-world away from the United States. But sometimes a ""distance"" may not be physical. In such cases distances and even barriers may be psychological and/or cultural rather than physical. The hired-help may be inside the large manor where high society is congregating but not really be a part of it. An extra on a movie set may brush against the star actress occasionally, but they are worlds apart even if the physical distance may be very close.

In the case of ""The 100-Foot Journey"", the distance is simply between two competing restaurants in a small French town south of Paris: a posh traditional French restaurant under the same leadership since the 1960's and a new upstart restaurant offering Indian cuisine to French locals. Although the distance is only 100 feet, at the beginning of the film, both restaurants represent not only competing cultures, they are almost like two rival nations. Each has its monarch: Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) is Queen of the French restaurant, and ""Papa"" (Om Puri) is the older king of the Indian restaurant. They each have their crown prince or princess. Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) is the young aspiring chef-in-training at the French restaurant, and Hassan (Manish Dayal) is the star chef at the Indian restaurant.

The battle is not waged with guns or cannons (except for one scene), but with meats, vegetables, and spices. Their prize is not territory but the prestige of gaining the coveted stars which are listed in the Michelin Travel Guides, a series of annual guide/reference books published by the French company Michelin. The Michelin Guides, originally published for French motorists over a century ago, are the oldest and best-known European hotel and restaurant reference guides, which awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments. Michelin publishes new editions of their guides every year with updates, and acquisition or loss of a star in the guide can have dramatic effects on the success of a hotel and restaurant.

The ratings are as follows: One star: ""A very good restaurant in its category."" Two stars: ""Excellent cooking, worth a detour."" Three stars: ""Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey."" We learn early on that the French restaurant has had one star since the 1960's but has never achieved another. Now the war is on between the two restaurants which covet the ""prize"" of the Michelin stars. But like the Capulets and the Montagues of Romeo and Juliet, the prince and princess of the two restaurants begin seeing each other in secret away from the protective ""walls"" of the restaurants unbeknown-st to their respective monarchs.

A wonderful thoroughly enjoyable film which is not only a clash of cultures and attitudes but a clash of wit and ideologies. After a brief introductory episode in which the eldest son recounts his family restaurant in India, the first half of the film is about how the two restaurants dislike each other and find ways to undermine each other's businesses. But as the story progresses, we learn this rivalry has many more negative consequences than the outcome of one side winning and the other losing, which is I think the point of ""The 100-Foot Journey"". The journey becomes not only one of cultural respect and admiration, but I think a transcendence of our deepest fears of when ""the other"" comes to town and sets up shop.",1420761600,,3912,5.0510835913312695

For us, Hellen Mirren, great actor that she absolutely is, was not really believable as a French woman--Pronunciation when she spoke French was slightly off enough times that her portrayal just did not quite ring true.  The setting never rang true either.  The ""village"" seen off in the distance looked completely computer generated and there was an overall feeling of ""Movie set"" about the whole movie.  Anyone who has seen fireworks knows how fake-looking the ones depicted in this film were. The story was solid and there was very good acting, but just too many distractions. Entertaining, but not entirely satisfying.",1420329600,2,688,4.854700854700854

As a foodie, the food looked delicious.  There are many good life lessons in the story line from  overcoming loss of family and livelihood, moving into a totally new culture to start over, tolerance and understanding of cultural differences.  The comedic sense of humor and sometimes lack of a sense of humor was fun to watch.  A great lesson was that success is not always reaching the top of ones profession.

I'm interested in cooking, so the storyline about restaurants and chefs, the pursuit of excellent, the desire for acknowledgement were interesting to me.

We are still the lesser chef, artist etc. oh wait... if we are mothers or school teachers or nurses we may be the best in a movie...grrrrrr...",1420156800,,420,4.072289156626506

6581844,5,B00MI56U6S,"Incredibly heart-warming AND not your average hollywood romantic comedy either so it was just a delight. I LOVE Helen Mirren and would watch her in any role, any role at all. I love French and I love Indian food and music, so it was really a nice way to relax and welcome the new year (2015) by this story of passion around food, love, and the world of taste.

The movie highlights two human emotions that were done really well: Arrogance and Determination. Arrogance to hurt someone whom you think is the enemy, driven mainly through jealousy, and determination to follow and pursue a dream no matter what, even after someone you love and adore is gone from the picture. I loved it and so glad I was able to watch and enjoy this movie. Helen Mirren was stunning as ever.",1420156800,2,771,4.468085106382978

6581849,2,B00MI56U6S,Meh. The book was waaaay better.,1420070400,,32,4.5
6581850,2,B00MI56U6S,"Amazingly tedious considering Helen Mirren is in it. There was just so much activity going on, but nothing happened. I saw the 700 plus 5 star reviews and even read a few, but I guess I'm just demanding more for my entertainment dollar these days or I should say entertainment hour. I really resent being hijacked for over 2 hours thinking every 15 minutes, ""it's got to get better"". I love Helen Mirren, she's always good in everything and I will usually trust anything she will put her name on, but this is a disappointment. It could have been a very good movie, but it wasn't. The principals' acting was good enough, but there just wasn't any depth to the story and not enough believability involving the  circumstances, the actual cooking abilities and the finished dishes themselves.

When you see a story treatment like this where the facts presented aren't in evidence you know they are trying to cheat. If I had seen the kid laboring over the mother sauces or mastering French cuisine in secret or if I had seen activity in the French restaurant showing the level of dedication and expertise you would expect in a 2 Michelin star restaurant I might have been less skeptical, but I had to take it on faith and I don't like to do that.

I could be being a little unfair. I must have read in the last year at least 10 or more books either by chefs, sous chefs, food critics and interested observers like Michael Ruhlman, who actually has written  books about people who have diverse occupations such as wooden boat builder, pediatric cardiologist and chef. I enjoy his books about his experiences very, very much and always look forward to a new one. Anyone who enjoys the technical aspect and also the soul of cooking should look him up on Amazon. But I digress ...All you have to do is read some of these books about chefs or by chefs to see what goes on in a starred kitchen or even an unstarred kitchen for that matter. These guys are dedicated and it shows.

Perhaps I'm taking this review too seriously. Sometimes I log in to Amazon just to check if my order has shipped or whatever and I find myself thrown into an opinion request page about something or other and the last thing I wanted to do tonight is go on and on, ad nauseum, ad infinitem, about this movie. It really doesn't matter very much.

Happy New Year to all you book lovers

I would recommend these books to anyone interested in cooking.

Back of the House by Scott Haas - about Cragie on Main and Chef Tony Maws.
Life on the Line by Grant Achatz.
Kitchen Confidential by Tony Bourdain - (the reason why I never eat at a buffet anymore).
Sous Chef by Michael Gibney -  a wonderful book about how kitchens really function.

6582028,4,B00MI56U6S,"In the Hundred Foot Journey, the Kadam family leaves India for France where they open a restaurant directly across the road from Madame Mallory's (Helen Mirren) Michelin-starred eatery.

The wife from time to time picks out movies that I probably wouldnt normally pick and that can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the movie, and in this case I didn't really know anything about this movie at all and wasn't so thrilled about watching it.  But after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained.

This movie has a wit and a charm that really won me over.  There are some really funny moments and Mirren and Om Puri (as Papa) really steal the show with their comedy, charm and romantic chemistry.  Although the rest of the cast are very good in their roles, they made the movie to me.  In addition to a good story and a lighthearted romance without being too much so.

And although I haven't read the book, this movie got me interested in reading it.

Overall, a movie that is worth a watch that has a good story, charm and wit.

6582078,5,B00MI56U6S,"A beautiful movie in terms of story, acting and scenery. Taking place in France, its the story of a Hindu family forced to leave India after some sort of political crisis. They end up inFrance and open an Indian restaurant 100 feet across the road from a very classical French restaurant. The restaurant is owned and run by Jelen Mirren's character and the story is about her going from unacceptance of the new family and their restaurant to more than just acceptance but love. And visa versa.

Other than Mirren I had no idea who the other actors were so for me the movie was more story driven. It is a beautiful movie to watch, the scenes of France make it worthwhile alone.",1419811200,,676,4.495934959349594

My only complaint has nothing to do with this movie per se; at the end of the film, the Amazon movie lineup appeared across the bottom third of our screen.

6582197,5,B00MI56U6S,"The premise is simple.  Yet, the story is as complicated as life can be.  The short of it is that an Indian family--escaping violence in India--settles into a small French town and starts an Indian restaurant.  The location isn't the best, however, since it's directly across the street (100 feet away) from a well-known French restaurant--quite traditional.  The fight begins.

The long of it is that the main chef/cook of the Indian restaurant is self-taught, but amazing. There is a love interest (back and forth) chef in the French restaurant.  She is all about technique.  This isn't the only relationship building here though.  You really must watch to find out more.

The Hundred-Foot Journey is a love story about people and food.  Moreover, it is a story about tolerance and understanding different cultures.  That is truly what the journey is all about...blending, combining and dancing together with love.",1419552000,,916,5.121621621621622

Will probably watch it again in 4-5 months from now.  It's also a great family picture that will give you a taste (pun intended) of other cultures.  Enjoy!

6582350,3,B00MI56U6S,"Although the movie was good, there was nothing new here. Clash of cultures, rags to riches story. First hour was paced nicely, however the last hour it felt like the filmmakers realized they still had a ton of story to tell and jammed it into the last 60 min. Helen Mirren, as usual is entertaining as the owner of a French restaurant, and Om Puri, does well as Papa the head of the Indian family who opens a place 100 feet from Mirren's establishment. Most of the plot is predictable, but enjoyable enough to keep watching. Worth a watch.",1419292800,,539,4.454545454545454
6582351,3,B00MI56U6S,"It was just ok. Predictable plot line (which I don't mind, because I love romantic comedies), but there was no real conflict or drama or falling in love in this movie. I mean, the main characters get together in the end, but there was no real passion or chemistry between the love interests. There was no pining away for each other, no burning desire to BE with one another. As a result, this movie could've been 30 minutes shorter and it would have been fine. I wasn't expecting anything earth-shatteringly beautiful, but this still didn't quite live up to where I wanted it to be.",1419292800,,582,4.552380952380952

Tragedy forces a family to remake the family business in a foreign land in direct contact with a foreign personality of the same business.  The tale is woven together with challenges, disappointments, triumphs and setbacks.  Men and women can enjoy the film as cultures cross on a culinary playing field with human emotion taking it's toll and pleasure. Stubborn meets stubborn is a good sub title.",1419206400,,458,4.846153846153846
6582374,5,B00MI56U6S,"Yes,yes, I loved it as I watched it several times over(5)because it made me feel warm and good inside for the first time in a very long time where films are concerned and I have watched the very best of what's on Amazon. I watch mostly Christian films but since there are not very many of them, I do switch over to some secular films that are not filled with trash talk, the V word and sex. This one was recommended to me by Amazon because of my history of NOT wanting garbage on my Kindle. Anyway, this was wonderful. I loved Helen Mirren as the pretty-older french owner of a small restaurant in the south of France called Sol Plural (Many suns?). Along comes an East Indian family from Mumbai and watch out....the sparks fly literally. I laughed. I cried. It was pure pleasure and pure joy. I found that the pigeon and truffle dish Madame Mallory served the Minister was a brain child of the author/writer Diane Cabaldon from her book Voyager. Yes, she actually made up that dish for her book. I found a blog called Island Vittles who made this dish in her kitchen but did not say how it really tasted. It was made with quail since she could not find any pigeons in her Canadian province of Pender, BC.( I think that's right?)

But as for the food, well, I went out and bought as many spices as I could so I could cook Tamil Indian food. Just not the urchin dish. Something with coriander (cilantro) and curry and some garam masala tossed in at the end. It's called layering. It was an adventure into a new culture for me and I came out really happy. I have always liked French quisine but it is too rich and unhealthy so vegetarian Tamil cooking is more to my liking so I am delighted. Lots of fresh veggies and no meat....hold the sea urchins. French food centers around meats, sauces and small amounts of veggies or so it seemed in the movie. I could go on and on about what I loved about this film, the lighting, the music; oh! that wonderful music by R. A. Rahan! What a master of sound! He is the best in the world. Just the best ever. Buy the sound track, you won't be sorry.

And I just want to mention in passing that the leading male actor Manish Dayal (Hasan Kadam). He is the most handsome man I can ever remember seeing in films of late. He is so, so gorgeous. I mean whoa......well enough. I highly recommend this film to those who love food and good music. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

Congratulations to the directors of this marvelous movie. Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were two I recognized who produced it. I was happy to see their names in the rolling credits. Great job! Keep them coming O-girl.",1419206400,,2631,4.321862348178137

6582416,5,B00MI56U6S,"Of course, notwithstanding the excellent contribution made by Helen Mirren, her role is well balanced by the other participants in this family-friendly and absolutely engrossing drama which tells the story of the surviving members of a family displaced from their homeland and their family restaurant business by arsonists to seek a better political climate in Europe. Starting again in England they soon discover  that their father has not found suitable raw materials from which to make their time-tested signature Indian dishes even thought their spice chest survive the inferno. So their father drags them on across Europe until their brakes fail and they are forced to stop. Something about the taste of the food in this small French town brings memories to each member of the family as they are taken in and fed by a young local woman who happens to be of similar age as the family chef. Good performances by all and a well-crafted screenplay under competent direction makes for a very pleasant and entertaining way to spend an hour or two.",1418947200,2,1046,4.977142857142857

6582506,4,B00MI56U6S,"While the story doesn't really take any risks, THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY is a feast for the eyes and is bound to make you hungry after watching it. It is about this Indian family who moves to France to start a restaurant, but ends up across the street from a competing restaurant run by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). Although things start out extremely competitive, gradually both sides get friendlier and learn something from each other. The main character is Hassan, played by Bollywood actor Manish Dayal, and although he is the focus of the story he fits within a larger framework of cultural exchange that I believe is the core message of the film. They flirt with a couple of romances in between things, but they never really let that get in the way of the main story. All of the performances were really good, although nothing I'd say was outstanding. As Helen Mirren is the only performer I was familiar with by name, I'd be apt to say she turned out the best but I was keenly aware throughout the whole film that she was just putting on a French accent. I never really bought her as the  character she was playing, even if she did a good job in a rather superficial way. In fact, I'd go so far as to call most of this film superficial. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but they played things almost too safe in the way the story developed and the turns it took. Lasse Halstrom's direction was suited to the material, but nothing beyond that. However, I will say that the score by A.R. Rahman and the soundtrack, which had a few classic French pop songs, was excellent. It did a very good job of blending the two cultures you see onscreen. And, to be honest, I think that's what most people will take away from this: it's a celebration of culture, food and how people bond over these things. It may not be a great movie, but it's definitely fun for the entire family.",1418860800,,1878,4.459302325581396

While this movie demonstrated the hard work and passion it takes to achieve, it seemed oddly sterile and frequently left me unmoved.  The acting was good but in many cases the chemistry between the characters was minimal.  And in the end, all was wrapped up with a bow.

There was no option for renting a single viewing, which used to be around $2.99.  Now the only option was for 3 days and cost $4.99.  I only wanted to watch it once so the 3 days was excessive and expensive.  I didn't like having to pay for something that I couldn't use.

That part of the story was not only sufficiently developed, but also left questions unanswered as to how an Indian youngster learned to appreciate the French cuisine and developed himself into a acclaimed French chef with no apparent hitches.  The story also stokes strong interest in the sou chef character.  The movie, I think, would have been more fully enjoyable if it pursued this lady a little further.",1418515200,,521,5.166666666666667

Helen Mirren is terrific as the uppity Madame Mallory. She builds a character that you would like to knock off her pedestal.  Manish Dayal (Hassan) also gives a great performance as the ingenue chef. Om Puri (Papa) is a major scene stealer. He solicits many laughs and delivers a touching portrayal of a man who would do anything for his family. This film tackles breaking down prejudicial barriers and misconceptions. It is full of whimsy and heartfelt emotion. This is a great movie for foodies, filled with amazing cuisine.

There were some blurbs which suggested the story was meant to be about two cultures -- and the long/short journey to cross to reach each other. But I didn't see any in-depth cultural explication,  especially the Indians, who could have been from anywhere.

We don't get to know the Indian family, the younger siblings, or what they want, or their relationship to the French.

Although it's a romantic comedy, it's not heavily doused with romanticism, the movie is primarily a funny comedy with some romantic stories running in parallel.  Most of the humor comes from contrasting a French lady that likely embodies all of traditional French culture with an Indian man that likely embodies all of traditional Indian culture, and it's hilarious!  The humor isn't ethnic and cheap, the comical scenes are far more thought-out and nuanced.

6582688,5,B00MI56U6S,"If you love the incredible scenery of southern France, if you love French cooking and Indian cuisine, if you love what being in a connected ,functioning family with all the disagreements, means in one's life, if you love stories about overcoming adversity to fulfill who you really are, if you  love Helen Mirren's multifaceted acting abilities, and love to  see her with a cast of characters just as determined, strong, picturesque, and funny, you will find this film a positive benefit!

The filmmakers unfolded this story in an immediately catching way, and continued it steadily with mostly gentle ups, downs, funny conflicts, tests of faith, and adversity to a heart felt and very satisfying ending.

It begins in India, with a family of ""cooks"" (their word for the deep sensual and heart knowledge of how to put food together to make it celebrate life and honor the costs of having to kill  in order to eat and survive), who had a two or three generation restaurant that succeeded until an election, the results of which did not agree with a mob, which took out their anger on the restauranteurs, setting the place on fire.  The family lost everything, including the beautiful and much beloved mother, who had been imbuing her younger son with the skill and deep understanding of food and cooking.  They decide first to go to England, but, alas, as Poirot says, the English have no cuisine and do not respect their vegetables.  Buying  a funny old blue truck, they travel to France, but not without amusing mishap, ending up in the old, abandoned restaurant, 100 feet across the road from the MIchelin coveted one star
restaurant Helen Mirren's character inherited from her deceased husband. She is stiff, unwelcoming, perfect in
her manners and (French)accent, commanding,and ready to protect her territory.  A riotously funny ""war"" between the now two restauranteurs ensues.  The father of the Indian family of five, is just as strong, but a bit more gentle
than she, so the teeth gnash and the knives clash, but in the spirit of having the perfect enemy with whom to wage
war.  So there is no bloodshed until her top chef takes it into his spirit to stop the competition by harm. This seems to be a turning point for Mirren's character; she dismisses him.

 Meanwhile, the youngest son,Hassan, the one taught by his mother, is interested in expanding his passion for learning all he must know about the preparation and presentation of life enhancing food.  So he, in contrast, is the
second melody, one for connecting, integrating, sharing, learning, and uniting whereas Mirren and Papa, are head to head in competition.  In fact her whole life has been that strict aloneness and single-mindedness to overcome competition.  The story then evolves through Hassan's choices to fulfill his dream.  So for this to happen, after creating some unity and amity between the two cultures and restaurant menus, he must leave them.  Hasn't this happened to most of us?  We have to go away, to find out what we really value.  (So you see I have l left the particulars, which are delightful, out, so you can experience them, but the overall direction remains as the
skeleton.)  There is  much beauty, heart and humour to cheer you, and make you fall again in love with life and
living and what happens when you follow your heart based intuition.",1418169600,,3341,4.84330985915493

Helen Mirren gives another bravura performance as a French lady who owns an exclusive restaurant in a small French village. She is the reigning queen of cuisine until the Kadams arrive from India and set up their own restarant right across the street. She immediately begins a war to rid herself of this new rivalry and what ensues is a wonderfully funny, touching and romantic tale, not without some heartache along the way. Racial prejudice does not overshadow the scenery, the food or the acting but it is a definite underlying theme. But all is deliciously prepared, with some witty dialog added for good measure.

We watch a lot of movies on Amazon Prime . . . this was one. When we see one this good, we usually buy the disk, so we'll have it when in the mood for something like this.

6582767,3,B00MI56U6S,"Some people will really love this film,  It is the kind made for people that like slow paced comedy dramas that meander along and for food connoisseurs.  The actors do decent jobs and it tells the tale of a immigrant Indian family looking to start their own restaurant and settle down directly across (100 feet) from the most popular French restaurant in this area of France.  Helen Mirren owns the French restaurant.  The movie moves slowly and then rushes the end to give an uneasy feel to the finish.  I thought it was a decent film but not to my taste.  One thing that bothered me was that the family lost everything when their family restaurant burned in India, but they still had money to buy the large building and completely renovate it.  I guess my idea of losing everything and theirs is too different things.",1418083200,,819,4.568493150684931

The reason I gave it only 3 stars and more than likely it will not be a part of my video collection is about 1/3 of the way into the movie the plot became very predictable.  What I was disappointed in the most though was the end.  The they worked hard to build the story line and plot and then i felt like it ended suddenly I was a bit disappointed in that.  I won't say anything about the end because I don't like to be a spoiler,1418083200,,488,3.938775510204082

The only small point that I wanted to add is that I think The Hundred Foot Journey reaches the quality on film that other foodie/romance movies in the past attempted to reach, but they didn't quite get there.  I'm so glad they didn't cut it to 1 1/2 hours. Give this one a taste, it gets 5 non-Michelin stars from me.",1417996800,,422,4.25

There is a sub-plot about xenophobia in France, but it is a distraction from the story, not a compliment.

My whole family really enjoyed the beautifully produced ""kitchen romance"" set in the bucolic countryside of France, flavored with exotic curry, and served with flair and poignant fragrances of authenticity.  The Hundred-Foot Journey started as a book prescribed by an accomplished journalist for a friend who directed Chocolat - so it's no accident that we sense a reprise.  Also the book is worth reading, and its readers will not be disappointed by the movie.  Helen Mirren and Om Puri along with dreamy Manish Dayal and pert Charlotte LeBon weave themselves into two pairs of believable romances in a light-hearted yet socially significant tale of cultural collision and reconciliation.  Your eyes will tear up, as ours did, when nobility of character and proofs of love ripen into full bloom;  it's a romantic comedy, delightfully presented.",1417910400,2,908,5.227586206896552

6582862,4,B00MI56U6S,"Richard C. Morais's book by the same name has been dissected and recombined by Steven Knight into a screenplay for Lasse Hallstrm to direct. The book was solid: the movie wanders a bit but the overall result is a pleasant if not exceptional film.

Talented Mumbai cook, Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal), has a life filled with both culinary delights and profound loss. Drifting through Europe after fleeing political violence in India that killed the family restaurant business and their mother, the Kadams arrive in France. Once there, a chance auto accident and the kindness of a young woman, Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), in the village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val inspires Papa Kadam (Om Puri) to set up a Indian restaurant there. Unfortunately, this puts the Kadams in direct competition with the snobbish Madame Mallory's (Helen Mirren) acclaimed haute cuisine establishment across the street where Marguerite also works as a sous-chef. The resulting rivalry eventually escalates in personal intensity until it goes too far. In response, there is a bridging of sides initiated by Hassan, Marguerite and Madame Mallory herself, both professional and personal, that encourages an understanding that will change both sides forever. The importance of the Mihelin Star seems paramount until the plot become syrupy and a bit to heavy on the predictable sweet this-is-the-best-of-all-possible-worlds side.

Nice cast (including bit parts by Clment Sibony, Michel Blanc, Amit Shah), colorful settings (though the cinematographer blinds us a bit too often by shooting into the light), and a nice lesson on intercommunications and cooperation between cultures.

6582900,4,B00MI56U6S,"Theres nothing in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" that the whole family cant see, thanks to an overly dark night scene thats so murky you cant tell whats going on. There is a fire and a character does die, but theres nothing so graphic that it would warrant staying awayespecially when the theme of cultural acceptance and understanding is one that many parents would like their children to see.

""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" goes a surprising number of places for such a short trip. Its a love story, a story about culture clash, an underdog success story, and a movie that celebrates foodalbeit one that devolves into a food fight at one point, figuratively speaking. But this little film has heart. How can it not, being executive produced by the reunited team of Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey? Everybody in the audience gets a box of warm fuzzes.

Adapted from Richard C. Morais 2010 novel, ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" features Helen Mirren as Madame Mallory, a widow who operates an haute cuisine restaurant that has earned a single Michelin star, and she wants another. Soon, as the audience senses, her life will radically change when an Indian family buys the shuttered, former restaurant one hundred feet across the road from her.  What makes the film successful is that the journey does involve so much, and metaphorically it serves to remind audiences that sometimes taking a few steps can lead to new attitudes and even reconciliation. I won't say that every character has a journey in this film, but certainly the four main actors have arcs to follow and explore.

Despite a second-act sag thats almost as plodding as much of what we saw in another culture-clash film, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is an entertaining, feel-good movie that can make a difference, if you let it. Unlike ""Chocolat,"" ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" doesnt celebrate the magical properties of food as much as it does the magical ability of humans to heal themselves, and each other.

6582902,5,B00MI56U6S,.Best movie of the summer,1417046400,,25,4.2
6582903,5,B00MI56U6S,"The Hundred-Foot Journey is a pleasant movie about the clash of traditions, elegantly prepared food, finding oneself in the world, and discovering love in unlikely places. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the film is a welcome alternative to typical fare at the summer cinema since theres not a spandex-clad superhero, explosion, or car chase in sight. Its a gentle film about the problems and conflicts of real people.

Forced to leave their Indian home when their restaurant is destroyed, the Kadam family settle in a small village in France. The family is headed by Papa (Om Puri), who discovers a property for sale where he believes he can open a new restaurant, with his son Hassan (Manish Dayal) as chef and the four other children pitching in. The problem is that across the road is the Michelin-starred restaurant run by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren), an aloof woman who runs her establishment with military precision and prides herself on serving exquisitely prepared classic French dishes. She regards her new neighbors, their foreign cuisine, their informal style, and their restaurant  Maison Mumbai  with disdain and tries everything to sabotage it.

The early part of the movie features the sparring between Papa and the judgmental Madame Mallory, both fiercely stubborn. Meanwhile, Hassan has taken a fancy to Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), a sous chef at the French restaurant, and longs to establish himself as a world-class chef. He knows he has much to learn, but he has talent and determination.

The Hundred-Foot Journey is a character-driven movie. Ms. Mirren, who specializes in playing austere, imposing women, gives us two sides of her Madame Mallory. Her coolness and intractability are not the entire portrait. This lady has another, softer dimension that reveals itself gradually as the film unfolds. This development is believable because the script by Steven Knight (based on the book by Richard C. Morais) provides some crisp dialogue and situations that dramatically alter Madames perception of the Kadams. She comes to see them as people rather than stereotypes and rivals.

Mr. Puri is fun to watch. He plays a shrewd businessman with a vision of the future and resolute determination and despite personal loss and family hardship. In Papa, Madame Mallory has met her match. This elderly gentleman is perhaps the first person ever to take her on, and she is thrown off balance by the challenge. Yet there is never any doubt that, at heart, Papa Kadam is sweet and gentle.
Mr. Dayal pales beside his two co-stars. He is charming and good looking, but cant hold the screen the way Mirren and Puri do.

Ms. Le Bon is far more successful as a bright young woman who shares Hassans love of fine food preparation. Her cheerful personality brightens her scenes and we like her instantly. Her Marguerite provides some pointers on French cuisine to Hassan, and eventually they fall in love. Unfortunately, because of the strong leads and Mr. Dayals limitations, this romantic sub-plot lacks the spice that Hassan favors in his cooking.

You won't find any earth-shaking conflicts in the movie, though the characters and story do engage us. One episode focuses on xenophobia, but this incident does more to draw the rival restaurateurs together than distance them. Several close-ups are devoted to beautiful vegetables and assorted kitchen activities. Though preparation styles differ significantly in their restaurants, the devotion to quality and authenticity of both restaurant owners is never in doubt.

Rated PG, The Hundred-Foot Journey has a leisurely pace that permits us to get to know the characters and see how their perceptions alter as their hopes and dreams develop. The formula may be familiar, but its like looking at a menu of familiar items. The familiar can be enjoyable and fresh if presented just the right way.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include an interview with producers Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg; making-of featurette; digital copy; and a video illustrating how the Indian-inspired dish coconut chicken is made.",1417046400,,4076,5.1527987897125564

6582906,5,B00MI56U6S,"The Hundred-foot Journey has a hidden message, not picked up by the reviews I've skimmed, either of the movie or of the book. This message is why I am writing a review, and encouraging you to either see it, or to read the book by Richard Morais.

The Kadam family's restaurant in Mumbai, India is burned down during a riot, with mother dying. After this tragedy, they end up in France, and, through the failed brakes of their van, in a little village with a famous restaurant and the empty shell of a failed one. Despite opposition from his children, Papa buys the building, and sets up a garishly Indian restaurant.

There is cold war between the two eateries, with lots of conflict -- until, again, the Kadams' restaurant is attacked with fire. Then the two sides draw together in a wonderful way. The dragon running the French restaurant hires the Kadam son, Hassan, who is a gifted cook, sets him on the road to fame. He and Madame's deputy Marguerite fall in love -- as do Madam and Papa.

That's the surface story. It's entertaining -- scary in parts, funny in others. That much, to me, is ""see it and forget it."" What lifts the story above the ordinary is the subtle lesson underneath. While Madame and Papa engage in ""payback,"" an eye for an eye, Marguerite and Hassan act with consistent decency and generosity, even to the ""enemy."" It is her reaction to an act of hate that turns Madame around into a person who acts from Love, even if in her characteristically prickly way. In turn, her unshakeable determination to make amends converts Papa from bitterness and resentment to caring and good humour.

This is exactly the kind of culture change humanity needs in order to survive. We need to replace ""an eye for an eye"" with caring and sharing.",1414886400,24,1754,4.594249201277956

It has sad moments, thoughtful moments and laugh-out-loud moments. We can all relate to the family members that we love to death that also drive us to distraction at times. You will not like this movie if you require thrills, tension, violence, overt sexuality and ""adult"" themes and language -- so don't bother if that is your cup of tea.

6582908,4,B00MI56U6S,"Helen Mirren is one of the most reliable actresses in Hollywood - whether shes playing the Queen of England or a gun-toting renegade, its obvious she cannot be stopped, and she has a very good eye of what projects to take on. Except I have no idea why she didn't do The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, or its upcoming sequel, but we can forgive a thing or two.

""The Hundred-Foot Journey,"" based on Richard C. Morais 2010 novel that wound up in Oprah Winfreys infamous book club, arrives about four years after the novel. Not having read this novel, I cannot be of any input about what was cut, what was kept, or what was changed in a negative or positive way. It would seem that the novel has a fan base. I can just tell you about the film itself, which I found to be a (somewhat predictable) delight.

The film follows an Indian family that recently moved to France, a father (Om Puri) and son Hassan (Manish Dayal.) The two come across a space that they think would be perfect for a new Indian restaurant that they are passionate about opening. Across the street from their dream space is Madame Mallory (Mirren)s massively successful and upscale French eatery. Lines are drawn in the sand, and the two become rivals.

I felt like I knew where The Hundred-Foot Journey was going about ten minutes into it. I wasn't totally right, but that doesnt mean this film is unpredictable. More or less, what you expect to happen, does. However, the cast has quite a bit of charisma and the actors play off one another rather well.

Lasse Hallstrom, director of traditional Hollywood melodramas like The Cider House Rules and Chocolat isn't in uncharted territory here. This film is as traditional as they come, but this is not a negative. On the tail-end of a summer stuffed with action movies and sequels, a well-crafted melodrama like The Hundred-Foot Journey is most welcome.

Its also gorgeously shot. Its little French village is depicted as something heavenly and majestic. Hassans passion for cooking is the core focus of the movie. The camera watches the food like its in love with it, and thats just the way it should be. Its likely to bring your inner foodie out.

In the end, its not the story, or the culture-clash themes, or even the food that make this film a worthwhile experience - its the characters, and how the actors play off each other. Its not one of the best films Ive seen this year, but its great for a small summer diversion.

I loved every delicious minute of it, from the descriptions of gourmet cooking to the intimate relations between the Indian family members to the French characters who are drawn into the tandoori oven, so to speak. The acting was superb, the writing and direction ditto, and I must visit that gorgeous little town in the south of France -- beautifully captured in this charming film. Helen Mirren is a delight, as are the Indian father, the son who loves to cook, and the French girl who is captivated from the get-go.

6582914,4,B00MI56U6S,"""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is one of those feel-good films Hollywood manages to release every summer. Many people eagerly anticipate these films, preferring them to the big-budget special effects filled summer blockbusters. It is entirely predictable, but fun and enjoyable nonetheless.

Many of these films are British and involve down-and-out workers who luck upon an idea to create something that will earn them the money they need (""The Full Monty"", ""Calendar Girls""). I think ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" qualifies as an American film - the producers are Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey - but it clearly wants to fill a void in this genre. This 'American' film has a British lead actress (Helen Mirren), Indian co-stars (Om Puri, Manish Dayal) and Swedish director (Lasse Hallstrom, ""The Cider House Rules"", ""Chocolat"") all on board to make the film more marketable in foreign countries and territories.

The Kadam family (Om Puri is Papa, Manish Dayal is Hassan, the family chef and there are four other siblings) owned a very popular restaurant in India. Forced to leave, they travel to Europe, trying out different countries. England is too cold and rainy, so they hop into the broken-down family van and start driving. In the French countryside, the van's brakes give out and they find an old, vacant restaurant directly across the street from Madame Mallory's (Mirren) Michelin-starred restaurant. Naturally, she doesn't want to have the Indian restaurant the family plans as a neighbor and does everything she can to thwart their efforts. This leads to an ongoing battle between Mallory and Papa. But she soon realizes Hassan is a very talented cook and offers him an apprenticeship at her restaurant. There, Hassan meets Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), the sous chef. They seem headed for a romantic relationship, but she soon becomes jealous of Hassan's talents.

Directed by Lasse Hallstrom and written by Steven Knight (""Eastern Promises"", ""Dirty Pretty Things"", writer and director of ""Locke""), ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is a perfectly pleasant diversion, a nice way to spend a late summer evening. But there are no surprises, which is the only surprise given the pedigree of the screenwriter. Given his other credits, you might expect something with a little more bite from Knight.

Sitting in the theater, with your loved one and friends, you want to laugh a little, fall in love a little, watch some great food being made. Watching ""Journey"" is the equivalent of receiving a warm hug  sometimes you just need one.

And it makes you hungry. I consider it a good omen that we have two films this summer embracing the food-porn genre. In ""Chef"", director Jon Favreau makes us salivate just watching the lead character make a grilled cheese. In ""Journey"", director Hallstrom treats us to two different cultures. We are meant to appreciate the Indian food more, with its rich, exotic, warm spices and flavorful sauces. And these scenes are fantastic, they will reawaken your desire for and love of these exotic blends. Because the two restaurants are across the street from one another, Hallstrom also shows us the ultra-fancy, much more refined French cuisine created at Madame Mallory's. These comparisons are meant to show how much better the Indian food is, how much more flavorful, earthy and exotic. But the French food looks equally appetizing. This means we the viewers are constantly barraged by drool-worthy shots of food. I would recommend that you eat before you watch ""Journey"". Or at least have reservations for after the movie because you will be famished.

Helen Mirren is a great actress - she brings a unique quality to almost every role she inhabits, giving the character depth and history through the conviction of her portrayal. Perhaps even more impressive, she seems determined to not get pigeonholed into one type of character. From her Oscar winning portrayal of ""The Queen"" to an aging Mossad agent in the little-seen ""The Debt"", it is difficult to say there is a 'Helen Mirren' role. As Madame Mallory, she brings to life every fuss budgety detail that has made her restaurant famous and worthy of one Michelin star. There is a nice progression for her character as well. Initially, she is dead set against the Kadam family and their restaurant. But a number of factors lead her to change her absolute and narrow mindset. The beauty of having someone like Mirren portray Mallory is that she elevates the character and helps you forget how predictable the role is. The change in Mallory is not that subtle, but it is playful and fun.

Manish Dayal plays Hassan. Throughout, he seems to be on a ""Journey"" of discovery. Initially, his family is uprooted from India causing them to all live through a weird period of re-adjustment in London. But London isn't for them, so they set- off again, wandering through Europe. When they arrive in France, you can see Hassan waking up, ready to experience everything the beautiful countryside has to offer. As the family preps their restaurant for its grand opening, he begins to explore the area and becomes friends with Marguerite and they begin to teach each other about their respective cultures and cuisines. When Mallory learns how good a cook Hassan actually is, she offers him an internship and the rest, as they say, is history.

Om Puri, the Morgan Freeman of Indian actors - plays Papa - he always seems to play the wise, old patriarch of the family. He is the one with the vision and the one who decides that they should build an Indian restaurant in this small village in the south of France. He also isn't about to let Madame Mallory gain the upper hand. Once they begin their little battles, each initially approaches the clash as warriors, but over time, they begin to play the battles as more of a game of chess, trying to figure out how to one-up their opponent and provide a little speed-bump to the challengers day.

Charlotte Le Bon is Marguerite, the female sous chef working for Mallory. Before Hassan arrives, she is the one working towards becoming a chef, she is the one who shows the most promise. Despite her friendship with Hassan, she begins to feel threatened and she pulls back, becoming distant, unhelpful when she realizes Hassan has caught the professional eye of her boss. Marguerite goes through the most change and it is less predictable than you might imagine.

Lasse Halstrom is a safe director. He has made a number of films that are fairly successful. But if you were to ask someone who directed ""The Cider House Rules"" or ""Safe Haven"" or ""Dear John"" or ""Chocolat"", most would probably not be able to remember Hallstrom's name. If you are having a discussion with another cinephile and ask he or she to name a Hallstrom film, they would most likely say ""My Life as a Dog"", a Swedish film that was very successful on the art house circuit. It is also the film that brought him to the attention of Hollywood. made the art house circuit when it was first released. My point is that Hallstrom is not a director who makes especially challenging films. In fact, I just realized almost all of the films he has directed are based on books. Perhaps this is his calling card; he safely translates the book, allowing the fans of the original material to relive the book they love as a film. Because he doesn't have a particularly distinctive style he doesnt impose this on the source material or try to change it. He clearly does good work, but his films lack anything that would set them apart.

Some film directors want to hit you on the head or show off their style. Hallstrom wants to give you a hug. Nothing is wrong with either. But when all you get is hugs, you sometimes want a little fireworks as well.

Hallstrom's ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is good and the perfect way to have a food-gasm for the second time this summer.",1412208000,10,7842,4.860778443113772
6582915,5,B00MI56U6S,"This was a beautifully filmed, wonderfully crafted, expertly acted film. It gives the viewer a sense of the traditions, family dynamics, and cultural differences between the French and Indian cultures through the characters in the film: it shows how they battle and come together through their passion, almost a love-affair, for food as well as their need for companionship. Both the older and younger sets of romances are sweet, compelling, and well paced. Filled with subtle humor and laugh out loud moments, it's a movie where you quickly fall in love with the characters and have an emotional reaction to both their sorrows and triumphs.  Left me wanting to go out for a long, relaxing late dinner at a four star restaurant. Delicious.",1412121600,4,739,5.008130081300813
6582916,5,B00MI56U6S,"When a film is in the capable hands of Swedish director Lasse Hallstrm (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" and ""Chocolat"") we can sit back, relax, and enjoy the show, based on a novel by Richard C. Morais and produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. After an agitated beginning in which the mother is burned to death in an attack by vandals in Mumbai, we end up with her surviving family in a bucolic countryside in the south of France where we know we will enjoy a (sorta predictable) happy ending.

To add to our enjoyment, Helen Mirren gets to play a snooty dame! Located in Tarn-et-Garonne, France, she has a classic one-star Michelin restaurant right across the street (only 100 feet) from that upstart, family-run Indian establishment... Immigrants, no less...! After starting off on the wrong foot, things go from bad to worse, as the two irascible proprietors sabotage each other at every turn: One will buy up all the necessary ingredients from the local market that the other needs for that night's menu.

We see:
  * Helen Mirren (""Red 2"") Madam Mallory is the demanding restaurateur who is determined to earn a second Michelin star (a world-wide rating system for restaurants).
  * Om Puri (""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"") Papa Kadam is unwilling to knuckle under. Not only does he insist on his right to play his music (LOUD) in his establishment, he wants the freedom to barter the price of everything!
  * Rohan Chand (""Bad Words"") We meet darling Young Hassan Haji in the thriving family Mumbai restaurant. He already has finely tuned taste buds, so after that disastrous fire, he grows up to be...
  * Manish Dayal (""Switched at Birth"") Hassan Haji, the audacious son of that curmudgeon. He has had a knack for cooking all of his life and it just takes one omelet for Madam Mallory to see his potential.
  * Charlotte Le Bon (""Mood Indigo"") is the exquisite Marguerite, a sous chef in Madam Mallory's kitchen, with an ambition to do better. She is sweet and generous to a family that could use a little help.

In this PG-rated dramedy, expect no gunshots, no sweaty bodies, little or no profanity and no vehicular mayhem. The most violent thing is the fire at the beginning. Of course this is a feel-good film, so everyone has to learn a lesson or two, cultures must quit clashing, recipes must be blended and customers must be fed. The screening crowd applauded this one.

 Spices.  Flavors. Textures.  These are the elements in this outstanding little movie.  But I do not speak entirely of the cooking.  We more or less self consciously also deal with the blending of cultures and people, of customs, attitudes and outlooks.  We find it all to be to our advantage.
 The film begins in tragedy.  A family of Indian restaurateurs is caught up in a riot, their restaurant burned to the ground and the matriarch-the source of the food's flavor and fame-the matriarch, the mom, is burned to death.  The family, now only a dad and three grown off spring and a pair of still grade school age kids, flees to England.  Damp England does not suit Papa so he drags the clan across Europe seeking sunnier climes.  By happenstance they end up in a bucolic and beautiful French village, the home of a restaurant with a single Michelin star.  Madame Mallory, a widow, presides over the single star eatery like a Duchess.
 We find a very great deal to like about this perfectly prepared cinematic meal.  Director Lasse Hallstrom has presented a whole string of likable, sometimes loveable, smallish dramas for us in the past.  His achievements include The Cider House Rules, Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?  and the recent hit romance with Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum Dear John.  Not only does he put the pieces together but he also allows a shot of the French village from a distance that is of such surpassing beauty, of quaintness, peace and sheer loveliness that I appreciated it.  He needn't have done that shot but he did.  Thanks Lasse.
 We have the smart, crisp script from writer Steven Knight.  He also scripted the outstanding Amazing Grace and the grim tale of Russian gangsters Eastern Promises.  Steven Knight wrote from the original novel by Richard C. Morais, which now resides on my to read list.
 Now we are given a good script and sure and steady direction, all we lack are the actors.  Boy do we hit the jackpot in that category.  Nearly 70 years old, Helen Mirren has over a hundred credits on her sheet.  Her recent portrayal of a retired but still capable if lighthearted hit women in RED and RED 2 pleased the public. She is as smooth and practiced an artist as any living today and she demands our attention every second she is on the big silver screen.  She plays the French restaurateur showing a hard crabbiness that slowly changes into something better and less bitter.
 He story companion is Papa, the Indian family leader.  Indian born Om Puri plays Papa as a determined if not always rational tyrant.  He wears a face that looks like a mile of a potholed Indian back road.
 Manish Dayal is Hassan, the son of Papa who has inherited his mother's talent as a cook.  He is the pivot of the story.  Hassan has a kind of genius for flavors and how to combine them which the gastro- fanatic French cannot resist.  In spite of his lyrical name, Dayal is a native born American with a long list of TV credits.
 An ambitious young french chef works for Madame Mallory and competes with Hassan while falling in love with him.  Lovely French-Canadian Charlotte Le Bon plays the young chef.  She has slightly irregular teeth which makes her at once more authentic and somehow prettier.
 This international cast makes a wonderful, watchable five star film that adults will enjoy for two hours and two minutes.
 The Hundred Foot Journey carries a PG rating and while there are some mean people in the film there are no naked people, nor bad words.  The film is already an artistic and commercial success.  Made on a budget of $22 million it is now profitable with a domestic take of $46 million and is still to be released in foreign markets.
 People who complain about movies these days with all the noise and ruckus will want to support this terrific movie.  If we do not watch the good ones, Hollywood will only give us the noisy ones.
  In the credits we find a listing for Tutor, a rarity.  The two school age actors apparently kept up their studies while working.",1410393600,102,4040,4.633286318758815
6582920,5,B00MI56U6S,"The 100 Foot Journey is a charming film about change and taking chances. The film is directed by Lassee Hallstrom (Chocolat) and is based on a novel by Richard C. Morais. (some mild spoilers follow). The film follows an Indian family that is forced to leave India after their restaurant is burned in a fire set by rioters. They flee to Europe in search of a place to reestablish their restaurant and find a perfect place in a charming French village (Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val, located in the Midi-Pyrenees region).  Unfortunately, their new restaurant is located opposite (100 feet away) from a fashionable traditional French restaurant named Le Saule Pleureur that has the distinction of a Michelin star. The elder son on the family  Hassan- is an excellent cook but longs for more, and his thoughts turn to becoming a top chief of classic French cuisine. (end of spoilers).

The plot of the film is predictable and one can say it follows a typical romantic comedy scenario but the story is told in an engaging and charming way, with some excellent performances, that the film holds your attention. Helen Mirren is fabulous as Madame Mallory, proprietor of Le Saule Pleureur; she is formidable toward the newcomers but also has an eye for talent.  Om Puri plays the Papa of the Indian family, and is bold and boisterous as he faces down Madame Mallory.  Manish Dayal is excellent as Hassan, an excellent cook of his native food who likes to experiment.  The film has a warm feel to it as we come to know the characters and the lovely setting which looks like the quintessential French village.

6582921,5,B00MI56U6S,"In ""The Hundred-Foot Journey,"" Om Puri plays the patriarch of a large Indian family who are all gifted in food preparation.  When a fire and political unrest in their country forces them to emigrate, they arrive in the South of France, determined to open a restaurant.  When the son, Hassam, (Manish Dayal) points out that the French don't eat Indian cuisine, his father retorts that that's only because they haven't yet tried theirs'.  As luck would have it, when they purchase an abandoned villa to renovate, they discover that across the street is a French restaurant, run by Helen Mirren, which has the advantage of having one Michelin star, an honor everyone in the movie takes seriously.  The aristocratic Mirren, who is still grieving the loss of her husband, is naturally displeased to have competition and does everything she can to ""win"" the ""war.""  (You can see where this is going, right?)  They do everything but draw a line in the street with tape, but Hassam finds himself curious about learning French cooking, and it doesn't hurt that a pretty woman his age (Charlotte Le Bon) who works for Mirren seems willing to give him pointers.  Eventually, reconciliation occurs and Hassam gets the chance to follow his dream to become a great chef, but is that really what he wants in the end?

This movie is so adorable, you want to pinch its cheeks and tell it how much it's grown.  It reminded me of last year's ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""  The humor here may be a little hokey in places but never crude.  My only criticism was that it seemed a little too lengthy.
