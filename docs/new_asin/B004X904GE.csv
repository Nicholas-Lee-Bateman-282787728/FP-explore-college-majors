4493025,4,B004X904GE,"I love cats, and, not surprisingly, I love the show ""Must Love Cats.""  The problem with the DVD release of the first season is that it is missing the sixth and final episode wherein host John Fulton tours the Southeast; he also revisits Dusty the ""Klepto Kitty"" in San Mateo, California.  I recorded all the shows when they originally aired, and I thought one was missing on this DVD, so I double-checked.  This episode is listed in the episode guide on Animal Planet's website and is titled, ""Cat Colleges and Kitty Heroes.""  I don't know why it was left off, but it's a rip-off to leave off an episode, so I'm giving the DVD 4 stars.  I also wish there had been some special features, but there are none.",1313798400,21,706,4.441860465116279
4493026,5,B004X904GE,"This series couldn't be cuter or more entertaining. I've had cats and dogs all my life, but would not have described myself as a ""cat person"" until this show came along, and now I am HOOKED! The host is a charming young man who really does seem to love cats. He visits cats and their owners all over the country. The show has featured the ""Cat House"" which many of us are familiar with, but I just can't get enough of; a tree surgeon who rescues cats-up-tall-trees in his spare time, the Alamo's Guard-Cat, performing cats, fashionista cats, cats in wigs, and some WONDERFUL folks who have devoted their lives to saving cats from abuse, neglect and euthanasia. A recent viral video of a California ""cat burglar"" came from this show, as did many other much-viewed videos, I'm sure. Our host plays with the cats, talks with the cats, and sings to the cats. In one episode, he becomes part of an animal sculpture! Even the theme song hooks you. I recommend this for cat lovers of all ages, animal lovers in general, and it might even win over a few who are not-so-sold on cats...yet.

NOTE: I wrote this review before the DVD series was released. According to a more recent review, the last episode of the series is missing from the DVD set. You have to wonder how on earth something like that can happen ... this kind of carelessness might explain questions I have had about the quality of other series I have had in the past, but in any event, although I intended to purchase this series pretty quickly upon its release, that isn't going to happen until this error is corrected.",1309737600,21,1577,4.513986013986014

4493030,1,B004X904GE,"I  ordered Too Cute Puppies which was great as well as Too Cute Kittens and this one all together.  This one titled Must Love Cats sounded and look promising, but it's not about cats, it is mostly about the narrator.  Him traveling, him singing, him interviewing LOTs of people, him playing guitar, basically just him showing off.  There is very little video footage of cats.  And no real knowledge is gained either if one already has cats, we already know the information he was supposed to be ""discovering"".  The idea he had was to travel the U.S. to explore cat ""issues""; vendors of food, breeders, cat refuge centers, cat toy makers, etc.  But one does not have to love cats to watch this video, as you don't see many; you do however have to love HIM!  And I did not.  I could not even make myself finish watching it, he was so obnoxious.  I bought all three videos for my cat Micky as he loves watching Animal Planet on TV.  He was glued to the TV for the first two videos, but even he was disinterested in this one and after a few minutes of waiting hopefully to see or hear cats or dogs playing, he wandered off.  I wish I could return this purchase and get my money back.  The press for it is very misleading.",1398297600,2,1217,4.308370044052864

4493037,5,B004X904GE,This was a real great video. I found two ideas on here I'd like to do. One is take a trip to the Catskills and the other is make a cat enclosure.  Both were on here.,1363910400,,165,3.5833333333333335
4493038,4,B004X904GE,A great video enjoyed by us relatively new cat-owners and our kitty who also watched the video.  The only suggestion would be to have it slower paced.  There were parts we'd have liked to see zeroed in a little more.,1358899200,,216,4.375

4493042,5,B004X904GE,"I initially viewed this dvd on Animal Planet and enjoyed every minute of it. When I saw I could purchase
a repeat at a reasonable price I decided I wanted to own it. It is so cute how people in each state take care of
cats. Some of the extreme measures people go to are hilarious, but it is all in fun.
  I also found something to entertain my grandsons who have many action figure dvd's. They have two cats in their house so they found this to be entertaining. All in all, I found it good for people of any age.",1349913600,,512,4.009803921568627

4493044,5,B004X904GE,Im glad I purchased this item.  I read the other reviews ahead of time and almost didn't buy the dvd.  Im so happy that I went ahead and purchased it anyway.  The whole entire first season is on the dvd.  Including the episode with the kitty who steals from the neighbors.  Im not sure why some other reviews state that that episode is not on the dvd?  It is certainly there with the enjoyable whole first season.  This is for any cat lover. I cant wait until the second season comes out.  I will purchase that one too to add to my collection.,1334707200,,543,4.203883495145631
4493045,5,B004X904GE,"I stumbled upon this show just as it began showing on Animal Planet, and loved it! True, at least one show didn't appear on the DVD, but some of the segments seemed longer than I remembered from the original airings. Too bad this wasn't a 2-disc item, because I'm sure enough material was shot to fill a second disc, plus where are the extras? Anyway, I still give this 5 stars, because I MUST LOVE CATS!",1320451200,,404,4.328947368421052
4493046,5,B004X904GE,"I saw this on Animal Planet and immediately fell in love with it because it is informative and the host, John Fulton, made it entertaining, what with his love for cats and combining that with the musical numbers that he created; he went on a mission to prove to himself and the world that America is filled with cat lovers. Although the series was short, the DVD is even shorter because they ran a ""best of""--five one-hour episodes.",1316304000,7,432,4.551282051282051
