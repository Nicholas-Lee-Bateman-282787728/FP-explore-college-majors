8302048,2,B001FED5BG,"The film begins with scene after annoying scene of a woman being disrespected because she is beautiful. It's not fun to watch. Little girls want her autograph, hair stylists want to do her hair for free, and of course every man in Korea acts like a complete tool. She is raped and the scene in the police station afterward is about as repugnant as one could imagine in a plot like this. One cop says things to her like ""I can see where the rapist is coming from, with a body like that who wouldn't want to score it."" Another cop, a young patrolman, treats her with respect and tries to help her.

He stalks her in scene after annoying scene as she stuffs her face unattractively with junk food trying to make herself fat. She eats too much and throws up and ends up in the hospital. Then she tries to starve herself into looking gaunt. When she passes out in the park, the young patrolman runs out from behind a tree with a plate of dumplings. (I'm not kidding) ""This time it's going to cost you"" he says. She gets up from the puddle of puke she's been working on and gives him the evil eye. ""Only kidding"", he says. Ha ha ha. Then she puts on makeup to look like a ""bar girl. These are the steps on the ladder of despair she climbs.

It's like a 5th-grader made this film.",1337990400,,1273,4.213114754098361
