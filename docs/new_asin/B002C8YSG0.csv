It's liked receiving a book with chapters ripped out. Definitely wouldn't recommend it to any potential buyer because the storyline doesn't make sense due to how the scenes were cut and certain parts of the story were completely excluded. Save your money!",1454803200,,410,5.134328358208955

8363703,5,B002C8YSG0,"This is the second season of the television series that has become popular in Mexico and with latin Americans via Univision.  This season picks up some time after season one ended with El Pantera in the US being held by crooked DEA like agents.  La Raina isn't dead and Pantera is Looking for her.  This Season is less campy and much darker than season one, but the production value is so much better. (Bigger Budget and it shows) It still has the comic book feel but like a more expensive and mature comic book (like comparing batman's old detective to the new Dark Knight).  I would still recomend that you get the first season first so you have the back ground story.

Note: Si no habla Espanol, no es por usted porrque no esta subtitulo o doblar en Ingles. Es solamente en Espanol. (If you can't read this section don't order the DVD.)",1320796800,,839,4.457516339869281
8363704,4,B002C8YSG0,"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican series to date. It is sleak and stylish.  The cinamatography is excellent. The actors are attractive and do a great job.  The characters are well developed and the action sequences are pretty exciting. I love the sets and the panoramas of Mexico City.

The series is intended for a more adult audience as there is quite a bit of violence, some substance abuse and scantily clad women abound.

This dvd collection is in Spanish and there are no English subtitles available!",1295654400,,516,4.764044943820225
