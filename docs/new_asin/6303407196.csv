638971,4,6303407196,"Terminal Velocity is curiously one of the best b-movie of the 90's. Hitchcockian suspens, with a twist of action, spies, comedy and insane stunts. Sheen is cocky as expected, Kinski charming and a strong female character. Great opening scene, by the way. T.V is highly underrated and it's a shame. The director had skills and even if the screenplay is improbable, is surely fun to watch.
Too bad this blu Ray edition offers few bonuses. The visual quality is here for sure and the Dts Hd Ma 5.1 soundtrack is pulsating and gives great opportunity to let the Jol McNeely music to shine.",1388275200,7,585,4.689320388349515

638977,5,6303407196,"If you like action movies or have ever walked out of a perfectly good airplane with a parachute on your back (I have), you're going to love this action thriller starring Charlie Sheen as a hotshot skydiving instructor who meets his match in a beautiful blonde woman who poses as a skydiving student and whose arrival spells only the beginning of Charlie's woes.  The blond woman is not who she seems to be, and winds up bouncing off the ground (or did she?)the first time she goes up in a plane.  So as not to spoil the movie, let's just say there's a lot of excellent skydiving scenes, some russians, beautiful women, a lot of cloak and dagger, an undertaker, and a three-legged dog!  Take it from me, it's well worth watching.  But watch out for windmills!",1361232000,3,758,4.510948905109489

639056,5,6303407196,"Whoever said rent before buying needs a shot of adrenalin.  ""The Arrival"" and ""Terminal Velocity"" are equally the best films Charlie Sheen has ever done. His acting ability in Terminal Velocity is fantastic and the action sequences rival any of the ""great stunts"" films. Natashi Kinski is excellent as well and the chemistry between Sheen and her is reminiscent of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbet (albeit in modern times). Early on the film demonstrates creativity and hardcore action. The gun firing, explosions and fight scenes are so well done I'm surprised the film doesn't have more recognition.

Sheen working at an airfield as a sky diving trainer becomes entangled with covert Russian operations against his will. The film places humor at the right moments with Sheen delivering sharp one liners. The villains ground the story with serious ruthlessness and convincing twists keep you guessing. It seems to this viewer that much effort was put into the making of the movie and it really pays off. To this day it contains some of the best in air action scenes. The rural backdrop adds a great flavor. Not to be missed. ""Pack your bags we're go'in on a guilt trip.""",1341360000,,1171,4.909090909090909
639057,4,6303407196,"This was a generally fun film that is considered an action movie, and rightly so, but has its share of good comedy, too. Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now.

Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he did on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous.

There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, most notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a good rating.",1241481600,,1019,4.593406593406593
639058,4,6303407196,"TERMINAL VELOCITY, released in 1994, is a movie that has aged

extremely well, except maybe for the KGB and end-of-Cold War

mood that was reminiscent  of the era after the Berlin Wall

fell, and a new era was unveiled in the former one-party USSR.

The thrill and action aspects of this film, are as good as any

that the best Bond 007 movies had to offer, no doubt.

The 5.1 audio is phenomenal, as are the crisp, crystal clear

digital sequences on the DVD release.

Probably, it will mostly be the below 21 viewers who will

especially appreciate the extensive aerodrome and airplane

settings and sequences, considering that airplanes, even today

in 2007, are still somewhat exotic, as almost nobody has a

pilot's license, or has a parachute jumping training, for that

matter.

For the movie to show Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski at

their best, in those sequences, brings a valuable commodity to

the finished product, which is its  entire dream-like

atmosphere. This is what makes believable the otherwise

impossible turn of events, that favor the 2 protagonists against

failure, and against all odds, at each turn and moment during

the course of the movie.

The musical score is also exceptional, for a movie of this

genre, and is a pleasure througout the 90 minutes.

A last note, is the presence of James Gandolfini, early in his

career, presented as a ""bad guy"" obviously, yet ... this actor,

despite his later similar role in the Sopranos, is perhaps not

that much of a natural as a bad guy -  this being one person's

opinion.",1173830400,2,1555,4.758490566037736
639059,4,6303407196,I liked this movie. Even though one of the villans was a little over acted. I've seen it several times and enjoyed it a lot. Charlie Sheen is great. Nastassja Kinski is great also and absolute gorgeous. James Gandolfini is excellent.,1168300800,2,233,4.7073170731707314
639060,1,6303407196,Did the other reviewers watch the same movie I just watched???  This movie is so incredibly bad!!!  Please tell me it's supposed to be a comedy.  I laughed all the way through because it was so ridiculous.,1166659200,,205,4.486486486486487
639061,3,6303407196,"Ok, where to begin. This film is like a mix of James Bond, Mission Impossible, Eraser, and maybe a parody film. I only say this because many of the moments in the film are acted or scripted quite comedically. As far as the overall enjoyability goes, it was a  very pleasant action film, filled with action comedy, and thrills.",1162944000,,326,4.52542372881356
639062,3,6303407196,"A decent movie ; best part is that the director, D. Sarafian, has Sheen drive a white, 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T as a inside joke or a tribute to Richard Sarafian (dad? uncle? whatever) who directed the classic, Vanishing Point which had, as one? the? star a 1970 white Dodge Challenger R/T. As in Vanishing Point, car gets totaled...nice touch after 25 or so years.",1144972800,2,366,4.6461538461538465
639113,5,6303407196,Suspenseful action comedy with Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski. An American sky diver is urged by a former Russian female agent to help her in uncovering a gold smuggling. Nastassja Kinski is fascinating as always.,1135987200,,217,5.228571428571429
639114,3,6303407196,"a great ride, but Sheen seems misplaced in this one. Nastassja Kinski has never been sexier and awesomer. thrilling and action packed. the end with the windmills is the higlighted showdown",1066176000,,188,5.096774193548387
639115,3,6303407196,"Terminal Velocity is an action movie and it passes the first critical test of the genre-its action scenes are plentiful and well staged. The adrenaline rush of the quality action movie is here present and correct with plenty of moments that leave a viewer on the edge of the seat.
Charlie Sheen plays Brodie ,a flying and parachute instructor one of whose pupils is presumed killed while on her first parachute lesson. He is suspicious and discovers that his pupil is not only very much alive but is involved in a plot to prevent the Russian Mafia getting their hands on a gold shipment and thus further destabilising the newly emergent Russian state. The pair are pusued by the villains and there are car chases,aerial stunts (the last one in particular is stunning)and shotouts galore before the final resolution.
The problems start when the action stops -which is not very often. Sheen sleepwalks through the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Natassja Kinski as the KGB agent he becomes involved with. It is left to the bad guys as played by James Gandolfo and Christpher McDonald to steal the acting honours ,while the writers ability to write good dialogue lags well behind their ability to set up action scenes.
When the action is gping on -4 stars ;when the pace slows -2 stars.",1059350400,,1300,4.756637168141593
639116,5,6303407196,"What a milestone.  BRILLIANT film.  Ditch Brodie is the greatest of all skydiving he-men.  Team this specialist of the air up with Gabe Cash (land), Casey Ryback (sea) and Special Agent Johnny Utah (land, air AND sea- he's a surfer remember) as the ultimate early 90s American League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (the ""Squad"" for short).  Make Bill Blazejowski their manager (why? cuz he's the best character in cinema history & besides Keaton needs the work).  Set them against a gallery of rogues including Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, Powers Boothe's Joshua Foss, Christopher Walken's Max Zorin and Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Boddicker (you know, the muscle) for the perfect match between good & evil.  Package & sell it to Hollywood for a cool $100 million: I guarantee they'll make it back the first weekend, for who could resist?  Long live Tripod.",1039305600,,850,5.071942446043166
639117,3,6303407196,"Terminal Velocity was a very straightforward movie.  It described a believable and interesting tale of a young girl who got entangled with the wrong people but was saved by an honest skydiver who really cared.  The idea of her faking her own death was intriguing and the way the deed was executed was brilliant.  On the negative end, it became less watchable as she and Ditch constantly went from arguing to flirting.  The acting of the antagonists was well-done.  They look like mobsters and act like mobsters moderately well.  At a few points in the movie, they seemed to be hard to tolerate, with their ""know it all"" attitude.  But, the last few action sequences in the movie were excellent.  After watching the movie, it seemed like a believable plot that really didn't stretch anything.  The only other weak elements in this movie were the terrible attempts at inside jokes off and on throughout the movie.  But they (the jokes) didn't mean anything to the movie and it is a movie that I recommend.",977443200,3,1003,4.712643678160919
639118,5,6303407196,"(no, not the Beach Boys song) ... Here I go again (no, not the Whitesnake song) defending certain Hollywood actors ... I *like* Charlie Sheen and I like him in this movie ...
Here Charlie plays his I'm-just-an-ordinary-guy-caught-up-in-this-thing yet again, and while it's not ""Platoon"", it's midway between that and ""Hot Shots"".  Kinski is good and there's a pristine white Dodge Challenger here that meets an unfortunate end (I *hope* they used a double for the car!) ... Sheen has to ""borrow"" a beautiful yellow Corvette to catch the bad guys (at least he has style) ... And a Cadillac Allante' that takes flying lessons ...
Sheen is a skydiver down on his luck who accidently lands at what he thinks is a bachelorette party only to find out it's for children ...

The story will keep you guessing for a bit ... and I think Charlie *wants* his character to struggle ... he starts to put it together so he's not a total airhead here ... but he's *supposed* to be confused ... that's part of the story ... ummm, if he figured it out right off the movie would be over in 15 minutes, right? ...
""Drop Zone"" is a skydiving flick too, and who can't help but like Yancy Butler?  The story is a little more complex there, but it's a bit of a stretch too in places ... I have both movies and I like both movies ... I'd recommend both ...",974160000,4,1509,4.5036496350364965
639119,2,6303407196,"People have tried to explain to me how good this movie is, but to me it is a rather poor film. Charlie Sheen is okay. But most of the film just seemed to be lacking in many ways. The plot is not particuly clever but then not many action films are. But at the end of it I just felt it was lacking, that there was something major missing from the film. My pick for the skydiving action film would have to go to drop zone. I'd rent this one before thinking of buying.",972086400,,464,3.9468085106382977
639120,5,6303407196,"I last saw this film when it first came out in theatres.  It left a powerful impression in my mind that has haunted me for years now.  I speak, of course, about the daringly experimental and enigmatic conclusion to this  film, which is really the only part I remember.  The whole film, the  protagonists are trying to stop Russians (the antagonists) from reaching  somewhere in a colossal aircraft with bombs or something. At the climax of  the movie, they are forced to jump from this aircraft.  Through some air  craftiness of their own, the protagonists survive to continue fighting on  the ground with russians that have, for some reason, parachuted after them.  After throwing the bad guys into windmills (yeah you know, the ones that  move at about four miles per hour) and watching them be cut to shreds, they  give each other five.  Then it cuts to the ceremony where they're receiving  medals for their bravery in outwitting the Russians.  This may sound like a  typical hollywood ending but oh do look closer.  Because the climactic  battle took place on the ground, the commie aircraft was never stopped.  Unless the people that parachuted after them were the entire rest of the  aircraft'd crew, it arrived safely at its destination.  So, upon close  inspection, it becomes clear that the award ceremony at the desneumont of  the film is ironic.  Little do the characters in the film realize that they  have, in all actuality, lost the ""war"" and that they're about to  be bombed by russians or something simply because they forgot about the  aircraft!  As you might expect, this incredibly subtle and powerful satire  was over the heads of most viewers.  It even somehow escaped Leonard  Maltin's review and Leonard Maltin is a particular brilliant man in my  opinion.  In conclusion, if you've ever felt that film these days is just  too straightforward, that ends wrap up a little too tightly, heroes are  worshipped too wholeheartedly, and that governments are put together too  shabbily, this is the film for you.",963792000,5,2029,4.8617647058823525
