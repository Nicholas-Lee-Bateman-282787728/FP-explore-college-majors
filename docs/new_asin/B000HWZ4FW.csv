Its not as funny as I remember, but my kids seem to enjoy it.  Some Moms I know really don't like their kids using the word ""stupid.""  That word is used quite a bit in these cartoons, just an FYI.",1171843200,3,340,3.898550724637681

Buy it for your inner intellect and inner child",1171584000,,93,4.470588235294118
2644044,5,B000HWZ4FW,"I was 14 years old when this show first came out, so I was enough of a kid to enjoy watching anvils falling on people's heads, but grown-up enough to get most of the jokes.  Now, I'm twice as old as I was then, but I'm still enough of a kid to enjoy watching anvils falling on people's heads.  You could say that Animaniacs was my generation's Woodstock - I mean, if Woodstock had been a cartoon that featured anvils falling on people's heads.  Can't wait for Volume 3!",1169683200,4,469,4.247191011235955
2644045,5,B000HWZ4FW,This is a great compilation of the cartoon.  All the episodes that you may have or may not have seen.,1169078400,,101,4.05
2644046,5,B000HWZ4FW,"Volumes 1 & 2 has some gems I didn't get to see on TV since it was on TV before most adults got home - these are too good.  If you like zany, anvils dropping, off the wall... two gems, one is a reciting of most countries in the world on a world map that lights to show where the country is, rapid fire (have to admire him), and recitation of state capitals with a map and pointer.  Also fun is Anvilonia (sp?) with one of those sleepy style European national anthems.  These are just fun if you refuse to grow up and take life too seriously.  Dot feels like she's maybe 12 years old, but she reminds me of the girl that would chase boys into the restroom in 6th grade.  I highly recommend Vol. 1 & 2 for putting a big silly smile on your face... if it doesn't you have gotten old before your time.  You will not get Slappy Squirrel at all.",1168905600,4,839,4.024096385542169

8141761,5,B000HWZ4FW,"These animaniacs DVD's are exactly how I remember them back when they were actually on TV. It's terrific to see all the funniness again! I wish they had had this out much sooner! This show really brings back memories!

And I love it when Dot says ""Call me Dotti and you die""

I laugh every time! They crack me up!!!!",1196035200,,316,4.25
8141762,5,B000HWZ4FW,"This is my absolute favorite cartoon! i'm so excited they brought it back, and i loved amazon's discounted prices and free shipping! :o)",1184716800,,136,4.956521739130435

8141765,5,B000HWZ4FW,"Fantastic!  How long have we all waited for these to come out!  The best part is that they kept all of the original ad-libs during the intro tune, i.e. the second to last line is always different!  Can't wait for the next set!",1174348800,,226,4.209302325581396
8141766,5,B000HWZ4FW,I loved this show when it was on the air and my oldest kids were watching with their dad.  Now that it is on DVD my 4 year old can enjoy this with her sisters and we all laugh.  I am still amazed at how much intelligent information is passed along in this series...modern cartoons could take a lesson from Animaniacs..you can do the silly jokes and still teach a thing or two!,1174003200,,376,4.136986301369863
8141767,5,B000HWZ4FW,"I was only 11 or 12 when this series screened the first time round, though it was repeated ad infinitum on TV until at least 1998 or 99.  I think the show improves with each viewing.  The first time around a lot of the in jokes and witty lines were easily missed, but now I find with each viewing a better appreciation for the writing in this fine show.  These DVDs finally compile what is a fantastic TV show and even 14 years after the series premiered the show never stops being funny on an adult level.  it is the perfect watch if you have a spare 20minutes and want something light and witty but not mindless.  Well done to the writers!

Of particular note, the episode ""King Yakko"" in series 1, a fantastic Duck Soup parody in keeping with Yakko's Groucho Marx-esque nature.",1173312000,3,780,4.381944444444445
8141768,5,B000HWZ4FW,This is a great collection! I've been waiting to get all the episodes on DVD since the show stopped airing on TV. Any true Animaniacs fan will be jazzed to own this!,1173312000,,165,4.1875
