He didn't really look bad at all when he was supposed to be 120 lbs, most of the work  must have went into making him look 300 lbs.  Stephen King does make an  appearance in the movie as a pharmacist. Not a waste of time or money!",951436800,5,363,3.9178082191780823
861554,2,630439408X,"Neither suspenseful nor scary, Thinner is yet another weak adaptation of a Stephen King novel.  The movie strips the book -- which was severely flawed itself -- of any sense of dread or horror, and leaves us with something  about as appetizing as a wet noodle.  Questionable casting and rather lame  dialogue don't help matters.  The only bright spot is the gorgeous Kari  Wuhrer as a young Gypsy woman.

861730,4,630439408X,"Billy Halleck is an obese, upper-class lawyer, living with his wife, Heidi, and his daughter, Linda. One thing to know about Billy is that he loves and occasionally craves junk food. The town that Billy lives in is hosting a carnival, being ran by a family of gypsies. Gypsies that many of the citizens in that town see as troublesome.

One night while driving, Billy accidentally runs over and kills one of the gypsies, Suzanne Lempke, who seemingly appeared out of nowhere, while his wife was giving him oral sex. The next day at the trial, because of Billy's reputation as a powerful lawyer, the court rules the death as accidental and no charges are filed against him. However, justice is about to strike Billy in a whole new, twisted, evil way.

Furious at the injustice, Suzanne's 106 year old father, Taduz, puts a curse on Billy by touching his face and saying the word ""thinner"". Not too long after that, Billy begins losing weight at an alarming rate, getting extremely slimmer by the day. Billy gorges down as much food as possible to put the weight back on, but to no avail. In addition with Billy, many people who played a hand in the outcome of the trial begin suffering their own ill-fortunes. With time running out and a curse so eerie and merciless, Billy must find a way to stop the curse before he dwindles to dust.

Overall: After recently catching this on AMC's Halloween FearFest, I can honestly say that Thinner is now one of my Stephen King favorites. I love the psychological horror element added to this as the main character who once overstuffed his body is now struggling to keep himself from thinning to nothing. The acting from most of the characters is plausible for the most part. The effects done in this film are astonishing to say the least! I won't give away too much, but all I'll say is lizard man and leave it at that. We get an appearance from Joe Mantegna (voice of Fat Tony from The Simpsons) who plays the role of an underground crime boss to a T. Overall, Thinner is one that I recommend putting down on your ""to watch list"". It has its fair share of gross and semi-bloody moments but for the most part it's all psychological horror. I know how the saying goes, but in this case it should be called, revenge is a dish best served hot",1445385600,,2277,4.508474576271187

861828,3,630439408X,"Just about every Stephen King book and short story has been made into a movie or TV miniseries.  When these movies were at their peak in the 70s and 80s, I think we were supersaturated with film/TV adaptations and lost faith in both them as well as his writing (it's the same thing over and over again).  In the 90s, there was a revival to once again bring Stephen King fiction to a successful movie/TV format.  This was successful because we were not oversaturated and only the stories which were true to his writings were made, and they were unique stories rather than the ridiculous (ex. The Lawnmower Man which was so far from the original story that Stephen King sued in order for his name to be taken off of it).  This melding of the supernatural and paranormal horror proved to be an original tale as Thinner.

An obese lawyer, tipping the scales at almost 300 lbs, find himself in a bit of trouble one night.  Quite by accident, he runs over an older gypsy woman with his car one night while distracted by his wife's heavy petting.  He and another friend in law enforcement cover it up and he avoids jail time or fines.  The gypsy man (whose daughter he ran over) approaches him, brushes his cheek with his finger and says ""thinner"".  He begins dropping weight, at first thinking that this diet he's on is really paying off, then as he continues to loose and loose and loose, at some point loosing 40 lbs in two weeks, he realizes he's being erased.  The gypsy man put a curse on him and he's wasting away.  The only way out is to pass the curse onto someone else, and he knows exactly who that someone else is to be (but I won't say to spoil it).

This was a good movie, probably the best qualities it has lie in the make up (fatness, the cancer eating away, psoriasis, wasting away), but the story moves along a bit too quickly and rather choppy.  It was one of those stories that are good stories as a short story to read but not for film adaptation.  It might have been a better TV miniseries (in 2 parts).",1423440000,,2018,4.346666666666667

I felt that none of these actors in the film were right for the parts or maybe because the acting in this film was painfully mediocre, the only actor who gave a great performance was the mafia guy who was Billy's friend. 3. The soundtrack was HORRIBLE! Did the producers think that this movie was a comedy? It was so goofy and cheesy. 4. The movie is obviously low budget. 5. The main character, Billy Halleck, is made to look like a complete dick even though in the book he was really a half-way decent guy.

861957,4,630439408X,"There are no real heroes in this story, only bad people who mostly get what they deserve.

Billy Halleck (Robert Burke) is the biggest lawyer in town, both by reputation and size.  Weighing in at 297 pounds he is already on a diet mandated and monitored by his wife who wants him to lose weight.  Billy just won a big lawsuit for his client Richie Ginelli, called Mr. Mafia by Billy's daughter, who is an underworld crime boss.  He celebrates the victory with dinner with his wife and while traveling home he is distracted and kills a 75 year old gypsy woman who is in town with a local carnival.  Being the biggest lawyer in town and friends with the sheriff and the judge he barely gets into trouble even though he is clearly at fault and lies about what really happened.  Knowing the system he manipulates the truth and he doesn't accept the responsibility for his careless driving and actions.  He doesn't even get points on his driver's license.

After the court hearing the 109 year old gypsy grandfather of the victim touches Billy's face and says one word, ""Thinner."" Billy begins to quickly lose weight and no matter what he does he is facing death.  Everyone involved in the case and the release of Billy including the judge and the sheriff are dying of strange diseases. The common cause seems to be the old gypsy grandfather who touched all those men and said one word to each one.

Billy begs forgiveness from the grandfather who tells him that if he doesn't leave the gypsy camp that his curse will get worse.  Billy curses the gypsies as the White Man From Town because that is what the gypsies call him.  Vengeance turns out to be a pie served cold!

This was a good movie if you are a Stephen King fan.  I own the DVD and the book and I actually like the book better as it goes into much more detail as books often can do.  Both are worth watching and reading and are a good story line and entertaining.  If you love Stephen King it is hard to criticize him but this is a good story but not one of his best.  It is still 4 stars as some of King's average books are far better than other author's best efforts.

This movie contains some foul language and some scenes are gross and spooky.  If that is not your type of movie then be warned.  I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!",1344816000,,2304,4.338785046728972
861958,2,630439408X,"The track record for successful adaptation of Stephen King novels has been mixed.  The good (MISERY, SALEM'S LOT, CARRIE, DEAD ZONE), the bad (SHINING, DREAMCATCHER, TOMMYKNOCKERS), and the ugly (THE MANGLER, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, RIDING THE BULLET, CUJO and FIRESTARTER).
THINNER unfortunately edges its way into the bad.  It's a lazy, contrived venture, hindered by Robert James Burke's one-note performance, which is odd because the basically TV-oriented actor (LAW & ORDER SVU semi-regular) should have jumped at his first feature starring role.  Lucinda Janney as his wife also fails to elicit any real emotion or passion.  Ironically, TV vets Joe Mantegna (CRIMINAL MINDS), Michael Constantine (ROOM 222) and Kari Wuhrer (SLIDERS) manage to flesh out convincing portrayals.
King himself cameos as the NERDY pharmacist.

  The plot about a lawyer, who hits a indian witch doctors,daughter, in a car accident. The courts say it was an accident to. However, the witch doctor curses the lawyer. This makes the 300 lb, lawyer to become extremely thin. So the lawyer must do what ever it takes to get the witch doctor to lift the curse. Sounds good right.
  And even though the movie starts corny, it gets better.

861993,4,630439408X,"Stephen King books, almost every single one has been made into a film. Even out of his short stories we got Children of the Corn & Maximum Overdrive. Now we have novel based ""Thinner"".

Our movie focuses around Billy. A lawyer who ways a whopping 297 pounds. His wife and daughter often tell him he has to lose weight, and his respince is casually ""Eh, maybe these diets take awhile to work"". One night, Billy and his wife start getting frisky in his car, and he accidently hits an elderly woman corssing the street. After he shows no signs of caring about it, his friends help him avoid trouble in the courtroom, the womans husband puts a curse on Billy, making him Thinner whenever he eats something. After his life starts becoming miserable because of it, he pleads to the man to take the curse out of him, which he does, but then transplants it into a pie. He then comes to think that his wife is cheating on him, so he leaves the pie for his wife to eat, it works, but his daughter has also been murdered from eating the pie, Billy takes a slice of the pie, and is about to eat it, when he gets an unexpected knock at the door....

Alot of people I know do not really care for ""Thinner"". I didn't think it was bad at all, as a matter of fact i really like this film. Its eerie, creepy, and has great music my Daniel Licht. (who also did the music for Children of the Corn 3). Its got Joe Mantegna, who I love his work. Hes got that perfect mobster voice, and a perfect attitutde in movies like this and even in The Simpsons. So I would recommend, to either buy or rent Thinner if you come across it.

I give it a 4/5",1281052800,2,1621,4.172523961661342
861994,5,630439408X,"I actually really like Thinner. The storyline could potentially creep out an overweight person to the point of not wanting to lose weight ever! A fear of losing *too* much weight. Guess again if losing weight is something you want to consider (kidding!)

The storyline is definitely interesting, and creepy of course (I would expect no less from the master of twisted thinking Mr. Stephen King himself). A father/husband does something horrible and is forced to lose weight until he becomes so skinny (despite eating as much food as humanly possible) he gets sicker and sicker with each passing day.

The acting skills are fairly on the low budget side, and the way the movie was produced feels like a cheap horror flick (at least, in the beginning it does).

The story eventually tells its twisted tale and improves considerably after the first 15 minutes, however. It's the conclusion of the storyline that makes Thinner such an enjoyable movie.

It should be noted that even though I find this storyline a bit funny nowadays, back in the mid 90's Thinner was definitely taken more seriously. Back then a storyline like this -while probably not new or revolutionary or anything- was considered a bit shocking for the viewing audience. Thinner wasn't necessarily tagged immediately as a low budget flick back then.

Wheras I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Langoliers/dp/6305899398/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Langoliers</a>&nbsp;on TV and actually enjoyed it I just recently saw this movie. I'd always been curious about it and heard a lot of conflicting reviews of the film which didn't give the proper impression. So I finally saw it. Frankly.......it was a disappointing film. I've seen horror films before and most of them have some resolution in the end. While this one is unique in that it involves a very terrestrial curse rather then something supernatural. The problem is I was never really certain which of the central characters to route for. Billy Halleck,a lawyer presented in the beginning as having somewhat ""questionable ethics"" (itself a stereotype of the profession) may have been cursed by a gypsy for ""killing"" his daughter,being mildly distracted by his wife having given him ""oral pleasure"" in their car but at the same time some of the methods he uses to undo the curse,including an encounter with a mobster played by Joe Montenga,who was involved in a court case with Halleck as lawyer earlier in the film, become very selfish and sadistic. Not to mention that Robert John Burke portray's Billy Halleck as pompous and glutonous to an unbelievable degree. At certain points in the film it doesn't seem like his is really a life worth saving. Although the concept of bigotry against gypsies is covered to a certain point they are not portrayed as sympathetic characters either,but as nomad rougues looking for a fight. Not only that but another reviewer here is VERY correct:in terms of how Billy Hallecks misadventure takes him his wife,whose only crime seems to be trying to help him with his sudden weight loss it leads to a syndrome of misunderstanding,resentment and finally murder. There is an undercurrent of sexism behind it-a strong one. Kind of a letdown in a horror film where the storyline isn't supposed to take too much focus off the genre. But to avoid sounding too needlessly critical......this is just an okay movie as Stephen King movies go. And since he lives almost nextdoor to me,being from Bangor Maine myself I have some awareness of the New England culture and Stephen King certainly has done better examples of the New Englad horror ""genre I guess then this. So only if your really curious is this worth looking into just to see it for yourself.",1245801600,,2892,5.428888888888889

Robert John Burke plays a rotund, and thoroughly unlikable lawyer who literally gets away with murder. Drawing the wrath of a band of gypsies he finds himself on the receiving end of a thinning curse. No matter how much he eats, he continues to lose weight.
The premise is pretty original, and the cast does a really good job with the material they are handed. Burke as a slimy lawyer does a particularly disgustingly good job. He is so repulsive both in character and physically, you almost root for the gypsy.
**On a side note, I would love to see just how much this film affected popcorn sales at theaters where it played? Watching Burke shovel in food hand over fist is truly nauseating! I can't imagine anyone eating while viewing scenes of him stuffing away food to try and gain weight!!**
Michael Constantine does a great job as the 106-year old Gypsy King, and Kari Wuhrer is smokin' hot as his grand-daughter.
But this movie belongs to Joe Mantegna. His portrayal of mobster Richie Ginelli is the one likable character in the entire film. Mantegna is having so much fun as the vegeance seeking mobster you can't help but get caught up in the spirit of things. You almost wish the focus of the film were on the Ginelli character solely.
The story is a bleak a depressive tale, populated by unlikable characters. And while the special effects are fantastic and the acting top notch, it's just too hard to recommend this film for anyone buy die-hard Stephen King fans.",1224460800,3,1671,4.62962962962963

The evil old Gypsy (depending on what point of view or ""side"" your on) is especially creepy because he seems so ruthless. Tom Holland, who plays the main character as the cursed man who seems to be growing ""Thinner"", did a great job fulfilling his role.

Also, I must say that the production team of this movie really made Tom Holland's character look extremely convincing, mentally and physically.

The lawyer is an arrogant fathead (literally) who, in one funny scene, shovels in a trainload of food, and mistakenly flirts with the fiercely vengeful Gypsy daughter who flips him off. I think gluttony is a theme running through King's imagination, like the blueberry pie puking kid in Stand by Me.

Considered unsavory nuisances whom the sheriff wants evicted, the gypsies legally lure curious onlookers. One of them, Billy Halleck (Burke), a dangerously overweight lawyer, ogles the nubile gypsy daughter gyrating seductively, but her unexpected vulgarity sets a sinister tone for what follows.
In this 1996 Stephen King thriller, Billy and his wife accidentally run down and kill Lempke's aged wife after she pilfers from a drug store. However, the couple is immediately acquitted as townsfolk ""testify"" in a stacked courtroom. Enraged, Lempke eerily grazes Billy while murmuring the curse, ""Thinner.""
Within days, Billy credits his new ""diet"" for his sudden weight loss which continues at a frightful pace. The sight of him going from obese to ""normal"" to gaunt are truly frightening, especially as the gypsies mockingly camp nearby. Although other townsfolk are cursed in even more grotesque ways (one commits suicide), Billy realizes all are doomed unless he can reason with Lempke, man-to-man. Still, Billy is continually mocked, and flees with a near-fatal slingshot wound through his right hand.
Now, leveraging the threat of violence against Ms. Slingshot, Billy forces Lempke to reveal that the only ""antidote"" is to pass the curse to someone else, as deceptively as possible. With a few scores to settle, including that of his unfaithful wife, Billy sets the trap, but forgets one very important detail.",1054857600,18,1632,5.329457364341085
862079,3,630439408X,"Stephen King's Thinner is famous for one thing, and it's not this motion picture adaptation.  Thinner was the fifth novel released under King's Richard Bachman pseudonym, and its relative success on its own (along with a few tell-tale clues in the text itself) lifted the veil on what was already basically an open secret to reveal none other than Stephen King to be the actual writer.  If Thinner had been one of King's better novels, he would not have released it as Bachman; thus, the movie has little chance of becoming a classic or universal crowd-pleaser.  The main problem with this whole story is in fact one of thinness; unlike the main character, who enters the arena rather hugely and soon wastes away to nothing, the storyline starts out thin and basically remains that way.  Thinner just doesn't have the feel a Stephen King movie (or novel) should have; very little of consequence happens outside the tight strictures of the basic plotline; none of the characters seems to bring any life to what they are doing, and no one besides the young daughter is even remotely likable.  Depth of character and the inherently interesting relationships between seemingly real individuals make up one of the greatest strength's driving King's creations; oftentimes, movie adaptations fail to capture this important magic and, predictably, prove somewhat disappointing.  In the case of Thinner, such depth was never there to begin with.
Thinner is about as straightforward a plot as you will ever get from Stephen King.  Billy Halleck, an obese, morally ambivalent lawyer accidentally (with some help from his unsavory wife) runs over an old gypsy woman.  His friendship with the chief of police and presiding judge allows him to walk away scot-free, a fact which obviously annoys the victim's 106-year old father.  This gypsy king places a curse upon the men who killed and then covered up the death of his daughter.  Billy's curse comes down to one word, ""Thinner.""  He quickly finds himself losing weight, which seems to be a blessing - at first.  It doesn't take him long to figure out, though, that he is dropping two to four pounds a day regardless of how much food he throws down his throat.  When he sees the effect of the gypsy curse on his two friends, reality hits him like a great big frying pan.  As his fear and paranoia increase exponentially, he grows distrustful of his own wife, who truly is just a little too friendly to his basically unhelpful doctor.  In desperation, having failed to convince the gypsy to release his curse, Billy turns to one of his shady clients, using him to implement his own ""white man's curse"" on the gypsy king and his thoroughly despicable grand-daughter.  The ending of the movie differs slightly from King's original ending, but it comes off rather well.
All in all, this is a perfectly good movie that really doesn't even aspire to anything greater than what it is.  Stephen King makes another memorable appearance as the town pharmacist, and that is pretty much the highlight of the whole film for me.  If you are some kind of fanatic about movie makeup, though, maybe Thinner has a little more to offer you than it does me.  Taking a character from 300 pounds to 128 pounds in a matter of several weeks is not something you just do off the cuff.  Thus, the evolution of Robert John Burke's makeup becomes almost distracting as the movie progresses.  This is really beaten into your head listening to the commentary by director Tom Holland and actor Joe Mantegna.  Each stage of the makeup job is addressed, and I really don't care how many layers of latex the guy has on at any point or how that little bit of flaking and almost imperceptible sliding works and doesn't work, etc.  I don't often listen to movie commentaries to know how they normally go, but this one seems to point out too many little problems, editing mistakes, and budget-deprived inadequacies in the film.  Take my advice - don't listen to the commentary's litany of problems, just watch the film and try to find what little successes it provides.  Again, I'm not saying this is a bad movie; when it's over, though, you just kind of shrug your shoulders and go on as it immediately begins to fade from your memory.",1054857600,5,4236,4.76986301369863

862119,2,630439408X,"I think the thing that surprises me the most about Tom Holland's ""Thinner"" is that it was released theatrically. Based on the novel by the infamous horror writer Stephen King, this adaptation of one of his better-known books feels more like a direct-to-video release than a big-screen feature, with its low production values and overall cheap appearance. Having said that, the movie itself is entertaining to a point, after which, like many of King's novels (or movies based on them), it just flatlines.
The story centers around attorney Billy Halleck (Robert John Burke), whose string of successes have made him a name in his small town. He has a wife, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney), and a young daughter, both of whom have issues about his serious weight problems. ""I can't stop thinking about food,"" he tells his wife in the car on the way home from a celebration dinner, to which she responds with A) the statement ""There's more to life than just food,"" and B), a timely session of... well, you'll see.
Of course, during the ""act,"" Billy fails to notice the old Gypsy woman crossing the street, and strikes her with his vehicle. Given his status among the townspeople (coupled with the fact that almost everyone we meet in the film is prejudiced against gypsies), Billy receives little more than a slap on the wrist, after which he is greeted by the dead woman's father (her father?), who brushes his cheek and chants the word ""thinner.""
Now I'm sure I don't have to tell you exactly what happens to Billy, who, despite his efforts to maintain a stable weight (""I'm digesting 12,000 calories a day!"" he later tell his wife), loses 40 pounds in no more than two weeks. And the fat grams just keep flying, to the point where Heidi insists he check himself into a nearby male clinic, disbelieving of his theory that he has been cursed by the old gypsy man, whom he later sets out to find with the help of a vigilante he helped set free in a case.
If this all sounds rather hokey to you, that's because it is. The problem is, if my synopsis gives you this notion, then you're much better off leaving your experience with ""Thinner"" at this exposition, and avoiding the movie at all costs. Even for a Stephen King adaptation, the film is incredibly tough to swallow; the beginning and mid-section fares somewhat nicely, setting us up for a third act that showcases some nifty yet under-imagined make-up tricks (like we really couldn't guess that he was wearing a fat suit from the beginning), but fails in regards to giving us a sturdy conclusion that's worth waiting for.
Aside from the low-budget look of the film, there's not a great deal of commendable acting to be dealt with, either. Burke has some effective moments of biting humor, but he fails to register much in his confrontations with his wife, nor do we ever care much for him as a person wasting away as a result of his wrongdoing. The wife and child are basically stand-ins for those pesky times when the film needs some refreshment from slingshot-wielding gypsies and subplots involving two men who share a similar fate to Billy as a result of letting him go without punishment.
There is an intriguing premise underneath the mess that is ""Thinner,"" but the story and its execution follow a pattern very much akin to its main character's descent from obesity.",1019347200,19,3315,4.697594501718213

That's until he hits an old gypsy woman with his car and finds himself the victim of her father's wrath.  You see he's over a hundred years old (the gypsies father that is), though by the looks of the cancer growing on his nose he won't be around much longer.  Burke and co. conspired to make the old woman's death look like an accident and thus free him of any and all charges he could face in court.  After being touched by the gypsy he finds himself on the role of his life, or so he thinks.  He drops pounds like there candy - which we get to see him cosume much of.  Enter Joe Mantegna in his typical Mafia hitman role.  The two fight back and thats when things get really good. In the end nobody's spared there just deserts (excuse the pun).

The widescreen format keeps Burkes weight in proper perspective, instead of streching the screen like they do in those horrorendous pan and scan discs.  And the 5.1 sound is very commendable.  It's a Halloween treat that I've grown to appreicate more each year 'round this time.",970790400,25,1621,4.469387755102041
862123,5,630439408X,"This is one of king's best horror flicks!  It's scary and also in some parts, funny. But it is mostly scary.  It's about this lawyer that accidently hits an old gypsy lady and her husband puts a curse on him to  make him thin and he does. He doesn't know why he is getting thinner and so  doesn't his wife or daughter.  He seems to be enjoying it, until he  realises that his weight loss is out of control and it isn't due to a diet,  it is due to the curse, so he tries to beg the man to lift the curse and he  doesn't.  His wife and doctor don't believe him, so he gets back at his  wife with a poisened pie.  I don't wanna tell anymore, you will just have  to watch it and see it for yourself.

Unfortunately the plot is somewhat thin (excuse  the pun) but its definately fun. Stephen King plays a cameo as a pharmacist  as well. Not too bad but could have better. Also directed by Tom Holland  (Psycho 2, Child's Play, Fright night 2)",962668800,,341,4.2153846153846155
862125,5,630439408X,"This was a pretty good movie.  Of course, I love Stephen king films.  The only thing that didn't make sense about the movie is the way it ended, but besides that, it's a good film to own, Buy it!",962582400,,195,3.9743589743589745
862126,2,630439408X,"It seems that everything that Stephen King writes is turned into a movie of some kind. It is a shame that the thin plot is stretched into a movie. There are some good moments but overal it's to weak to carry the movie. (a  curse from a gipsy, after Lawyer Burke kills an old gipsy in a car  accident, will lead that Burke loses weight, and more than he would like to  lose from his overweight...) For S.K. fans a must to see, but if you want  your friends to watch a movie with you, then pic a better S.K. movie from  your shell.",958867200,,529,4.048076923076923

This is the only BAD movie that was ever made based on a Stephen King's book. THE MOVIE JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENCE. It's  about this man who first gets extremly fat and then suddently ( don't  remeber why) his weigth drop's and he becomes very, very thin. Then I don't  know why he want's to poison his whife with a poisoned pie. - I don't know  maybe the book is better 'cuz I never read it. Or maybe some people  understand it better but I don't think this movie is worth buying. Here are  some title of some fun, scary, great Stphen King movies - Carrie - (the  book was also great) Cujo  >>>>The Green  Mile<<<<<<< - (THE BEST MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN) The  Shining The Stand <<< ( Very good movie ) Christine (Also great)  Stand By Me ( not scary but a very sad, interesting movie)",956275200,,884,4.141176470588236
862128,4,630439408X,"Thinner is one of those extreme short novels by Richard Bachman, a.k.a. Stephen King. The film is well done, faithful and definitely full of rhythm, even if the format (length) makes the chase a little bit short. It  reveals how perverted our society is.

A judge, a lawyer and a chief of  police conspiring to save the skin of the lawyer in a road accident where  he was entirely responsible and under the influence of the alcohol and  overeating of a celebration.

But there is a moral in  this society,  even if it comes from the gypsies, one of the ethnic groups that is most  severely and racistly rejected. And this justice if a justice of curses and  God. When a rejected group is the victim of an injustice, God, even if it  is a sombre and unidentified God, gives them the power to impose their  justice through curses that reveal the real nature of the good local  notabilities of the city, society.

The lawyer will die by losing  weight, the judge will become a scaly lizard and the chief of police with  just rot away and finally shoot himself. They die by the very attribute of  their professions: the lawyer fattens on the crimes of society, the judge  is basking in the sun of his power to pronounce life or death sentences  unchallenged, even if he needs a jury from time to time, and the police  chief can do what he wants because he has the absolute power of firearms in  his hands.

But the film reveals,like the novel, the cynical ugliness of  a wife who causes the death of the old gypsy woman for the satisfaction of  her personal sexual pleasure, the famous Clinton's cigar, a long time  before any White House caper on the subject. When she finds out that she  can no longer dominate her husband, she will just cast him away with the  help of the family doctor, her lover, into an asylum, called clinic. Nice  middle class family morality.

But the end is even more gruesome. The  lawyer will try to revert the curse, and will succeed with the help of the  maffia, quite natural fiends, but he will kill his wife and kill his  daughter with the same stone.  Bachman, as opposed to King, will push  the gruesomeness to the end of its craziness and kill the lawyer, a suicide  this time, and the family doctor, a real vengeance this time, as the punch  line.

Gypsy justice is definitely pungent and tasteful. We would like  that kind of justice to be just a little bit more present in our life to  get rid of all the hypocritical bigots that govern us.

Sit back and just enjoy......so many great scenes.....I say the lines all the time in my daily life.  Bought this movie for everyone in my family.  It's about a lawyer who is cursed by a gypsy man to become thin and die.  So he starts to lose weight....no matter what he eats, he can't gain weight.  He starts to wither away and will basically die.  So he is trying to reason with the old gypsy to remove the curse but he refuses.  The guy playing the old gypsy man is great.....I quote him he is so memorable.  Anyway, he enlists his friend to help with the gypsies and the movie turns up the heat.  This is a great movie to have in your collection.",1493251200,,732,4.2773722627737225
