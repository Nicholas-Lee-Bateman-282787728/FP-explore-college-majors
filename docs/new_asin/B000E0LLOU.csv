8103499,4,B000E0LLOU,Empires - Great Religions is a good historical narrative.  I ordered the DVD's in order to gain some background and time references for the ancient Jews and early Christians.  I also was interested in the development of Islam. The DVDs are historical and scholarly and therefore should not be purchased if you are looking for an action movie or using it for entertainment purposes only.  In general I found this series to be a good overview of Christianity beginning with the ancient Jews and of Islam.,1334188800,11,502,4.813953488372093
8103500,5,B000E0LLOU,"I can only repeat what I wrote in the review to the other PBS Empires DVD collection:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Collection-The-Dynasties-Egypt-s-Golden-Empire-The-Medici-Godfathers-of-the-Renaissance-Japan-Memoirs-of-a-Secret-Empire-The-Roman-Empire-in-the-First-Century-The-Greeks-Crucible-of-Civilization/dp/B000ANVQ6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires Collection - The Dynasties (Egypt's Golden Empire / The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance / Japan: Memoirs of a Secret Empire / The Roman Empire in the First Century / The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization)</a>

The PBS Empires series of Documentaries is among my favorite of all time. Each of the 2-3 hours long titles brings individual episodes of human history to life in an as much as entertaining as educational fashion through original images of locations and objects, re-enactments as well as great original music. I have not seen a PBS Empires title that wasn't great and only regret that they made too few of them over the years.

This collection is also great, although the price is not as good as a bargain as for the other set, which is over $20 cheaper and provides over 200 minutes more content.

What the Amazon.com product description is lacking is the information, which of the PBS Empires series titles are actually part of this DVD set. Well, here is the list:

1. Empires - Islam: Empire of Faith (3 Episodes) ca. 160 min (2000)
2. Empires - Martin Luther (2 Episodes) ca. 110 min (2002)
3. Empires - The Kingdom of David - The Saga of the Israelites (4 Episodes) ca. 220 min (2003)
4. Empires - Peter & Paul and the Christian Revolution (2 Episodes) ca. 110 min (2003)
5. Empires - Holy Warriors: Richard the Lionheart & Saladin (1 Episode) ca. 90 min (2005)",1300147200,39,1790,5.692883895131086
8103501,5,B000E0LLOU,"These videos really surprised me.  I got them because I wanted to
learn more about history.  I had vague notions about things like
the Reformation, Crusades, etc.  but had never gotten a good
solid overview.  These videos provided me a great overview.  I learned
tons about history.  What surprised me was how beautiful some of the
videos' cinematography and re-enactments were. Especially the one on
Martin Luther which I watched several times.  The only negative thing
I can think of about these videos is that they might not be very
interesting to someone who already knows a lot about history.",1194220800,33,597,4.91
