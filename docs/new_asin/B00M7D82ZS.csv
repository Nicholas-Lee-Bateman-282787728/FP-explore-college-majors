6562616,5,B00M7D82ZS,being a life long Queen fan it was a true joy to see them so early on in their career.  those first three albums were my introduction to the band and there was nothing live audio or video from that era until now.  this set shows that were destend to be one of the greatest bands in the world.,1414886400,2,292,3.9322033898305087
6562617,5,B00M7D82ZS,"This isn't the best live Queen concert ever...that's something to be debated among Queen fans.
My personal preference is the concert recorded in Montreal in 1981.
That said, given that this show is from 1974 it's a great piece of Queen history.
The folks at Eagle Rock Entertainment are experts at taking older recordings and making them ROCK the newer technology.
I never got to see Queen perform live so I consider this a real treat and a great glimpse into the band's history.
And it really makes me wish Freddie had lived long enough to live with/beat AIDS.
Such a sad loss of one of the most incredibly talented rock stars ever.",1414454400,2,633,4.610619469026549
6562618,5,B00M7D82ZS,"I saw this tour as a wee young lad.....This music is was what set the stage for the super group the world would come to know....none the less they were pretty hot in my neighborhood at this stage of the game...I'm glad they were able to release this record, brings back many, many great memories......",1414195200,3,301,4.490909090909091

6562621,5,B00M7D82ZS,"I was pleasantly surprised at the audio and video quality of both disc's. Not sure if I needed to buy the blu-ray version since it's in standard definition,but per Eagle Vision,it's  upscaled SD.In any case,this footage captures Queen in the prime of the""hard rock""stage of their career. A period I think was by far,there best.
  I was lucky enough to see this band in '74-'75 in a small 6,000 seat venue  and again in 1980 in a much larger arena setting.
The first show, blow the second of the stage (so to say).No over-the-top stage or light extravaganza that the band became known for as they hit international stardom,but rather just the hard driving, pure energy of the ""personalized"" show is what made it simply incredible.
  This video captures that same intense,raw powered,hard edged rock n roll of their earlier years,that many fans never knew existed..I saw much the same song list in that first show,that is showcased here plus some,but they didn't do the medley of songs, rather full versions of ""In the Lap of the Gods"",""Killer Queen""and probably my favorite ""March of the Black Queen"" Queen at their hard rocking BEST.
  The energy of the band really shines through on this footage as does the quality of sight and sound. Very impressive for being recorded over forty years ago.
  For those of you who enjoy the music of Queen, and think it all started with ""A Night At The Opera""and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" Do your selves a favor and check out this video,as well as the LP's ""Queen I"",""Queen II"" and ""Sheer Heart Attack"".You won't believe what you've been missing. It'll open up a whole new world of Queen music for your ears.",1412035200,12,1638,4.735915492957746

This concert shows how young they all were and just starting out and they perform the very early recordings which is non existent on later live DVDs.",1445990400,,320,4.145161290322581
