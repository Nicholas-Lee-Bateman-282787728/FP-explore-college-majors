430423,5,6302158095,"Terrific concert.  Don't even bother with Frontiers unethical BD release of Asia Symfonia.  That atrocity is quite literally a DVD slapped onto a Blu-ray disc.  If you're a fan of Asia, this is the only one currently available worth buying.  Unlike the low def video and lossy DD sound of the Symfonia ""BD"", Fantasia features terrific HD video and both DTS MA and uncompressed stereo PCM sound options.  Be warned, the multi-channel remix muddies some of the lyrics though on the DTS MA track.  But it isn't a problem with PCM, so it's likely a fault of remixing for multi-channel output, rather than an issue with the actual recording or the acoustics at the concert itself.",1497139200,,675,4.775862068965517

430592,5,6302158095,"I first watched this film at my grandparents' house in Moraga and I still get a huge sense of how Walt Disney had the Philadelphia Orchestra synchronize musical works with animation used in this film. The segments of this film that I still remember vividly are the one featuring the Nutcracker by Russian composer Peter Tchaikovsky, and the Sorcerer's Apprentice. As a matter of fact, the Sorcerer's Apprentice was such a popular segment that the Walt Disney company did a rehash of that segment for Fantasia 2000.

If anyone has seen the Rite of Spring segment of this film, it is important to note that Disney's depiction of Dimetrodon living with Ankylosaurus and Nothosaurus is flat-out inaccurate, as is the depiction of Stegosaurus and Diplodocus living with the hadrosaurs and Tyrannosaurus rex, because Dimetrodon had been dead for 40 million years when the first dinosaurs walked the Earth, and Stegosaurus and the famous sauropods of the Late Jurassic had been extinct for 85 million years when T. rex terrorized North America. Also of note is the fact that T. rex was depicted in the film as having three fingers because T. rex was thought to have had three fingers when the film was released (it wasn't until the late 1980s that new specimens showed T. rex actually had two fingers), but also the fact that nobody had a serious discussion as to why dinosaurs went extinct when Fantasia was released, as evidenced by the orchestra conductor's remarks.",1458777600,,1462,4.919028340080971

It was marginally okay for the first 30 minutes or so, then had a few ""freeze"" moments, and then, during the hippo and alligator dance, completely froze, jumping around so much that we couldn't decipher either music or movement.  A huge disappointment.  Still and all, our 10-year-old grandson enjoyed it (he has more patience than we do!)

430739,5,6302158095,So this dvd of Disney's Fantasia is the uncut version of the roadshow which the interstitials of Deems Taylor were dubbed by Corey Burton because the original Deems Taylor's voice has been lost if you have the vhs version of Fantasia it the real Deems Taylor's voice which is restored in 1990 which is the general release version in 1946 which is not the roadshow version which has the end credits and I am waiting for the 1982 re release version of Disney's Fantasia which is the Irwin kostal version of Leopold Stokowski recordings which features Deems Taylor's interstitials were dubbed by Hugh Douglas which will come to dvd which is disc three this movie will deliver the goods,1440892800,,682,4.739495798319328

While it may be restored and remastered, it is certainly not the original version, my VHS copy was more 'original' than this. Do they really think that people will not figure out why someone took a video camera and 'zoomed in' on one of the centaurs in the 'Pastorale' sequence (leaving less than a quarter frame of the original movie screen visible), or that Deems Taylor's voice has been dubbed out for the length of the movie? While having a voice to sync to newly found footage is understandable, adding the footage and being honest with people (perhaps with captions) would be a better alternative (i.e. treating the audience like adults). It doesn't seem like that is asking too much (especially with the price that is on this release).
  If that were the only issue, then it would be somewhat workable. Aside from the 'Pastoral' sequence, the movie is a standard of animation art. While 'Pastorale' remains my favorite piece of music from this film, purchasing the soundtrack would have been better. The high point in the piece are the wonderful animations of the Pegasi family, but the cupids,satyrs and even the centaurs were too smarmy for my taste. There's nothing quite like a group of centaurs smiling nonstop while covering up the somewhat ridiculous characterizations of black centaurs, and the irony is sickening.

430979,4,6302158095,"I have owned this in four formats now:  VHS, Laser Disc, DVD, and now the region-free British blu ray.  This blu ray plays fine on my US region A player, so don't worry about that.

I agree with some of the other reviews about the ""edits"".  For example, there is a distinct scene where the scenery appears to ""move"" just for a second.  Since I have never seen the ""full"" version with the supposed ""racist"" implications, I simply wrote that scene off as an animation mistake.  It's noticeable, but just for about two seconds in a two-hour movie.  If you're not a die-hard purist toward the ""unedited"" Fantasia you probably won't notice the difference.

Now to sound.  During the Nutcracker Suite there is a sequence where the fairies are putting dew on flowers.  On the VHS version,  you hear violins as each flower is touched.  All other versions are missing the violins.  I  guess this was lost during the digital transfer.  Once again:  newcomers to the film will never know any better.

During the Ave Maria sequence, as the worshipers walk along the water with their candles, my speakers couldn't handle some of the low tones and the sound distorted slightly at higher volume.  I turned the volume down and the sound was better but not perfect.  I'm not sure if having an expensive  home theater system would cure this, but it's the only movie I've ever had a problem with.  I will have to remember not to play this sequence at high volume from now on.

There are other barely noticeable shortcomings to the sound throughout the film.  Still, it sounds amazing considering it was made over 70 years ago.

Yes, during the orchestral narrations, you can detect spots where the narrator's voice must have been overdubbed in spots.  It's better in my mind to have the footage even if it's not perfect.

Having said all this, if you are a newcomer to Fantasia you will enjoy it as long as you keep a couple of things in mind:

1)  It is NOT a traditional Disney movie with a plot and some music.  It IS a series of animated videos set to classical music pieces.
2)  Each music video is introduced by the ""host"" as if you were an attendee at an animation festival or something.  These ""introduction"" scenes do get tedious after repeated viewings.  After you see the movie all the way through a few times, expect to start fast-forwarding through the ""introduction"" scenes.

Other than that:  the movie is fantasic.  The animation is detailed and innovative.  All ages will love it.  View it with an open mind and don't expect it to be ""Lion King"" or ""Frozen.""

At some point, if Disney releases a version of Fantasia with the orchestral introductions edited out, I will probably own a copy of that version too.

For right now, though, this version of Fantasia is as close to perfection as you will get, and if you just enjoy it for the music, the colors, and the fantastic animation, you will not be disappointed.",1417478400,9,2910,4.598440545808967

431352,4,6302158095,"No other Disney film has received as much flak as Fantasia, Purist cry Censored! Re-dubbed etc., but watching Fantasia on the two film edition was absolutely amazing! The film has never looked this good and I doubt it will ever look better.

As far as the issues with the tampering of this film, I am not a fan of censorship, overdubs or any alterations for that matter, but considering this film was supposed to be a continuing ever changing piece of art, I don't mind the changes all that much. Sure I would love for the Black Centaur to be reinstated in the film and the original voice track featuring Deems Taylor, but while the centaur was a choice of cowardice, the voice track change couldn't be helped at least from what I've read.

While I can appreciate people standing up for what they believe it and fight against censorship or any other important cause, I feel to condemn this release for the few small edits is a bit harsh as no matter how tough you stand on this issue, things are not likely to change, we live in a different world where people are so fragile they can't handle the truth anymore.

The good news is at least now on Blu Ray the edits are flawlessly smoothed over so you can enjoy the other 124 minutes and 45 seconds of the 125 minute film.  My only other complaint is that they dropped a lot of the great bonus material from the 3 disc DVD edition.

431492,5,6302158095,"Movies affect viewers in different ways.  Sometimes they can be enjoyed for their plots, characters, settings or other aspects of the mise-en-scene; but they can also be appreciated subliminally, appealing to our imagination, whether conscious or unconscious.  FANTASIA is one of the best - if not THE best - example of this process at work.  The film's visual beauty is stunning - a testament to the labors of the thousands of animators who worked on the project.  The variety of visual styles is equally breathtaking, from the story of evolution recounted to the accompaniment of Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring,"" to the comic ballet performed by ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators (Ponchielii's ""Dance of the Hours""), and the devilish revel abruptly interrupted by the coming of a new day (Mussorgsky's ""Night on a Bare Mountain"" and Schubert's ""Ave Maria"").  Yet Disney was no high-flown idealist; he wanted his work to be accessible to mass audiences.  Hence these elemental sequences are juxtaposed alongside simpler stories, such as ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" in which Mickey Mouse learns the error of his ways.  The action doesn't take itself too seriously: while Dennis Taylor's narrative introductions are both concise and informative, he is shot against the background of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra taking a break from their labors.  While they have an important task - to ensure the music carries the narrative - they also need respite.  FANTASIA is the kind of work that befits repeated viewings in order to encompass is range of visual as well as technical wizardry.  Every viewer will interpret the sequences differently, which is precisely the point in any work like this.",1387929600,,1718,5.26007326007326

When I first saw it in the 1950's, it was mind-blowing.  To this day, I cannot listen to the Pastoral Symphony without the images of the mythology going through my mind.  While science and technology have overrun some of the visions of Disney's artists, the ""Rite of Spring"" still reminds us of ""earlier times"".  And who can forget Mickey and the Sorcerer's Apprentice  (eternally wonderful).
For those who enjoy the second Fastasia, the first (original) Fantasia is better yet.  A definite keeper.",1387497600,,674,4.911504424778761

MY BROTHER WANTED TO SEE IT.  I WAS TOO YOUNG, BUT REMEMBER HIS KNOWING ABOUT IT....SO I WAS MAYBE THREE OR FOUR.  THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY TOO YOUNG TO VIEW PARTS OF IT.

LUCKILY, I DID NOT SEE IT TILL I WAS AN ADULT....WELL, I AM NEARLY 76, AND WAS TAKEN SHRIEKING FROM THE THEATRE AFTER THEY TOOK THE TWO OF US KIDS TO SEE SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  I NEVER FORGOT SEEING THE QUEEN ONSCREEN, CHANGING INTO HER WITCH-PERSON.
ON A BIG SCREEN, THIS WAS TERRIFYING.
I MENTION THIS, BECAUSE TODAY'S CHILDREN ARE STILL CHILDREN FIRST.  THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALITY AND IMAGINATION UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE THOUGHT THAT ""LOST IN SPACE"" TV SHOW...WAY BACK IN BLACK-AND-WHITE-TV DAYS....A LOW-BUDGET, LAUGHABLE THING NOW....WELL, WE THOUGHT OUR LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WOULD ENJOY IT ALSO.  ONLY YEARS LATER DID WE ASK HER WHY SHE WOULD LEAVE HER ROOM AND SLEEP BEHIND THE SOFA, ALL HUDDLED UP WITH NO BLANKET.  WE WOULD FIND HER IN THE MORNING.  SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO BOTHER ANYBODY, BUT THAT THERE WERE ""CREATURES"" IN HER ROOM, SO SHE JUST LEFT!
MY HEAVENS!  WHAT DID WE, BOTH DEGREED EDUCATORS NOT THINK THROUGH!
SO:  WHILE FANTASIA - THE ORIGINAL - IS INCREDIBLE AND WONDERFUL AND FANTASTIC, IT MIGHT BE WISE TO DECIDE BY FIRST VIEWING THIS, AS TO HOW TO PREPARE ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN BEFORE THEY SEE IT.
""NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN,"" AND ""THE RITE OF SPRING,"" ARE BOTH ADULT FARE.  TOTALLY ADULT.  AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOMEWHAT SOPHISTICATED MIND TO UNDERSTAND THESE.

THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL FILMS EVER MADE, WITH SPLENDID MUSIC, OF COURSE.  IT SHOULD BE APPRECIATED BY EVERY PERSON.  THE TSCHAIKOVSKY ""NUTCRACKER SUITE,"" WITH LITTLE MUSHROOMS CIRCLING AROUND,  THE ""DANCE OF THE HOURS,"" WITH A HIPPOPOTAMUS IN A TUTU AND AN ALLIGATOR AS THE ASSISTING MALE....(PLOP!)  WELL, THE ENTIRE THING IS JUST TERRIFIC.
A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND JUST TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT SHE WAS TERRIFIED OF ""THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE"" WITH MICKEY MOUSE.  THE MUSIC FRIGHTENED HER AND THE UNENDING LINE OF BROOMS.

I THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO GO INTO THIS MUCH DETAIL.
KIDS LOVE HARRY POTTER.  BUT NO KID SHOULD BE VIEWING SWEENEY TODD.  SO USE DISCRETION AND MONITOR WHAT PARTS YOUNG CHILDREN SEE AND SAVE THE REST FOR LATER......MAYBE HANG ON TO THE DVD AND NOT HAVE IT AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE VARIOUS AGES OF CHILDREN.....YOU SHOULD, AS A PARENT, ALWAYS WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR KIDS, RIGHT?

431600,5,6302158095,"Over a thirty year period I have seen Fantasia (1940) in theaters on a few occasions. During each showing I witnessed several members of the audience walk out. That is usually a good sign. There is little doubt that this experimental film (yes, Disney once was innovative) has unmitigated moments of lurid kitsch, with equal parts cinematic magic. It's a flawed masterpiece, which begs the questions: does an infallible masterpiece actually exist? Fantasia represents it's creator, Walt Disney, as utterly possessed by obsessive, artistic, and innovative ambition. It may be one of the most stand apart films ever crafted, which is why, seventy plus years later, it still has the power to provoke dumbed-down audiences who still look at artmusic with suspicion. Simultaneously, it also annoys insufferable academic elitists who cannot find it in themselves to embrace the film's tawdrier moments.

Another supposed ""strike"" the film has against it is its choice of conductor: Leopold Stokowski. Stoki was the P.T. Barnum of transplanted Euro conductors residing in America. Mention him to any ""serious"" classical music lover and he'll make a face like he's heard fingernails scraping down a chalkboard. Stokowski was known for his Bach transcriptions, one of which--""Toccata and Fugue in D minor""--opens the film. Essentially,he romanticized Bach, making him sound more like Tchaikovsky. One wit described such tampering as ""High Cholesterol Bach."" It's a dishonest reaction, molded by unimaginative attachments to ""historical correctness"" and hyper-realism. Avoid such persons like the plague (they probably started life by pulling the wings off butterflies). For those of us who have no qualms admitting that we like plenty of syrup on our musical flapjacks, embracing this wizard's transcriptions presents no problems. Seeing only Stokowski's brazen self-promotion amounts to blindness. This former organist had one of the most prodigious gifts in drawing color out of every orchestra he worked with, which made him the quintessential choice for Fantasia. Compare his achievement in this film, awash in personality, to the comparatively monochromatic conducting of James Levine in Fantasia 2000.

The meeting of Stokowski and Walt Disney, in 1937 at Chasen's restaurant, is the stuff of legend. Disney was starstruck with the conductor's celebrity, mysterious accent, and fierce mane. The seed of an idea for a ""concert film"" sprang from the meeting. At this time Disney had only produced and released one previous feature: Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937). The idea of an animated feature had seemed risky and radical, with the naysayers predicting bankruptcy. The profits and critical acclaim from Snow White forever silenced those constipated doomsday prophets. Now, Disney was ready to take another risk. 1940 saw the release of Disney's second and third feature films. Artistically, it paid off as Pinocchio (1940) and Fantasia are, to date, Disney's two greatest films (yes, I said that), released only nine months apart. The former was a critical, box office hit. The latter did not make money for nearly twenty years. Disney had proven one can go indeed broke overestimating the American public.

The Fantasia deal signed, Stokowski was excited and predictably offered numerous ideas about the use of color. A later biographer wrote that the conductor's fascination with color was sincere, describing his various experiments with mixing alcoholic drinks for color effects. Stoki did a similar thing with ""sound color"" by incessantly changing the orchestra seating layout. Even visually, ""Toccata and Fugue"" is pure Stokowski. The opening piece is introduced via the superb narration of American composer Deems Taylor (to the public he was primarily known as a commentator for the NY Philharmonic Radio Broadcasts). This ""absolute music"" is total abstraction. Entirely hand painted, at times the watercolors almost appear to still be wet. Vibrant with texture, this is far removed from contemporary slick and soulless computer animation. Stokowski used no baton, so his beautifully powerful long hands are highlighted, jabbing through the splashing backdrop. The french horns are hauntingly lit in diaphanous color before the violin bows transform into silvery beams of light reaching for infinity. Sound and vision collide, producing crashing tides, ending in a literal fireworks display.

For those, like myself, who have overdosed on Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite,"" Fantasia serves up a refreshing alternate vision, the most incandescent and sensual vignette of the entire program. Naturally, it is abridged and rearranged like one of Stoki's infamous ""Symphonic Syntheses."" Unwittingly, Disney tailored this Nutcracker Suite for the upcoming hippie acidhead generation (who eventually elevated Fantasia to masterpiece status). Darting fairies, spectral spider webs, and psychedelic mushrooms are followed by larger, dew-shaking `shrooms engaged in a Chinese tango. Being a ballet, naturally there is plenty of dancing, but the Disney team imaginatively improve on the yawn-inducing holiday imagery that we have come to associate with Tchaikovsky's most famous music (which, as Taylor reminds us, the composer himself detested). Guaranteed, you will not find blue fairies, Russian Cossacks, pink fairies, waltzing flowers, orange fairies, or rhythmic goldfish mating with fairies (?) and swimming through an erotic Busby Berkeleyesque aquatic Arabic dance sequence at your local ballet company anytime soon.

Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice is justifiably Fantasia`s most famous segment. Having a narrative (albeit a wordless one) to work with inspired the team to great heights. It is possibly the last time we will see Mickey Mouse before he succumbs to total blandness. With its narrative of white magic and sorcery, it is remarkable that the evangelical zealots of the day did not hone in on this segment (the way they did more recently with the Harry Potter series). It's either that such types are somehow even more de-evolved than they were seventy years ago (possible, but not likely) or they stayed away from anything with the tag of ""classical music"" attached anyway. Since they didn't see it, they didn't know to get their feathers riled. Regardless, Stokowski had no such qualms. This being a tone poem, it is tailored for his bag of tricks. Even the most art-constipated among us can enjoy our once favorite mouse in the expert choreography composed by the Disney team.

Igor Stravinsky's ballet ""Le Sacre du printemps"" (""The Rite of Spring"") is served up here for the eternal dinosaur-loving eight-year-old boy. Actually, the ballet is about pagan sacrifice and is so dissonant and barbaric that it caused one of the biggest scandals of music history in the form of a violent riot during the 1913 premiere at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees. Regardless of the ballet's narrative change (and the necessary abridgment), the composer (the only living composer chosen for the film) at first loved the Disney/Stokowski version. Years later, he did an about face (as he was apt to do), vilifying it. Still, given the time, the Darwinism included here was a damned provocative decision. This was only fifteen years after the Scopes trial, yet Disney and team are showing us the beginning of life on earth as science has revealed. Fish mutating into amphibious lifeforms show the artists clearly siding with Scopes and Clarance Darrow. Naturally, the dinosaurs come, and no Creation Museum is going to stop them. While the Le Sacre du Printemps (2004) film by the tragically short-lived Oliver Herrmann might be aesthetically truer to the avant-garde nature of Stravinsky's masterpiece, Fantasia`s interpretation is rousing (and exhausting). After carnivorous lizards and the extinction of much life on earth, we deserve an amusing intermission with the soundtrack and, again Taylor is the host for the job.

Fantasia`s treatment of Beethoven's ""Pastorale"" symphony has always been a point of debate. Skinny dipping centaurettes are lured (by mooning cherubs) to square jawed, beefcake centaurs. Fortunately, the centaurettes do manage to squeeze into their garland bras because their male counterparts don't seem to know what to do next. Confused libidos and a bacchanal (where the wine is pouring) is rudely interrupted by none other than Zeus himself (wielding a lightening bolt forged by Vulcan). This is the famous ""storm"" movement of the Pastorale. Helios' chariot brings forth a much-needed sunset, and Selene tucks the Earth in with the night of her cape. Stokowski's reading, like Disney's animation, is anything but subtle.

Ponichelli's ballet ""Dance of the Hours"" (from the opera ""La Gioconda"") becomes what may be the most eccentric burlesque in the history of cinema. This is also a highly debated segment, which is to be expected with an amorous alligator cavorting with a hippo, alligators riding ostriches, and elephants riding alligators. Perhaps the Fantaisa-loving acid heads of the 1960s had a point.

Mussorgsky's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" was part of Stokowski's standard repertoire. He has his own arrangement, as opposed to the Rimsky-Korsakov edition used in most concert programs. The Witches' Sabbath brings out the Satanic Chernobog (modeled, in part, on Bela Lugosi and Wilford Jackson), descending on the town below like the Angel of Death terrorizing Egypt in the Moses narrative. Chernobog's demons join their master in this violent, surreal nightmare, which, unfortunately for the victims, features a fiery pit to rival the worst of the gnostic apocalypses. The sadistic, phantasmagoric mayhem retreats with the chiming of the church bells that herald the segue into Schubert's ""Ave Maria."" Some have held these last two conjoined segments as the film's best.

Walt Disney had planned more editions of Fantasia (which included a collaboration with Salvador Dali), but its initial failure laid such plans to rest until sixty year later when Walt Disney Productions released Fantasia 2000. Fantasia 2000 had fleeting moments of brilliance, but was mostly a disappointing sequel; too clean, too crisp, lacking the risk-taking intensity and provocativeness of the original. Pinocchio may have had boys turning into jackasses, and Dumbo (1941) had it's mind boggling ""pink elephants on parade,"" but Walt Disney's Fantasia is chock-full of progressive weirdness and an ardent embrace of art for the sake of art.

431618,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is one of my all time favorite Disney films. The quality of animation at the Disney studio reaches it's pinnacle with Fantasia (and Pinocchio).

The one thing that this laserdisc (and VHS counterpart) has that the DVD and Bluray doesn't have is the original Deems Taylor introductions (albeit the abridged versions). When this film was reissued in 1946, Taylor's wrap-around intros for each musical piece were shortened and remained that way for the next five decades. Unfortunately, when Disney was restoring the wrap-around segments in 2000, they were able to salvage the footage, but not the audio, so the narration had to be redubbed. Therefore, this is the only way to hear Deems Taylor's original narration. Even though it isn't 100% true to it's original presentation in 1940, this version I prefer, because it's what I grew up with. Not to mention that this is the version that most audiences from previous generations will be familiar with for the most part. And this transfer holds up very well too. The colors are vibrant and the sound is breathtaking.",1376352000,2,1072,4.988826815642458

(and with all the colors involved, we didn't think ""black vs white""). I think there's nothing more racist about the fancy, male-hungry centaurs treating their servant like dirt than there is in Aladdin when the guards (also drawn in an over the top way) wanting to chop off Aladdin's (or Jasmine's) hand for stealing a loaf of bread. Yes, it was racist, but it was reflecting existing racism. No matter what skin tone, people shouldn't treat people who are helping them like that, and it DOES show the bigger centaurs in a bad light. They deserve it. It's a darned pity they chose to mess up the music to try to protect themselves from the people who want to think that if they ever admit that the culture was racist, they are still tainted with it. People can learn, and we have. You can see racism, sexism and all sorts of shameful behavior shown in all ""innocence"" in most of the movies from the early 20th century- if you're looking for it.

431859,4,6302158095,"When I picked up this blu-ray at the store, I see that it is more than just Asia getting together performing the music of Asia.  This is a super group where the four members came from other successful rock bands.  In fact, big Progressive Rock bands. Geoff Downes (The Buggles) and Steve Howe from Yes, John Wetton from King Crimson, and Carl Palmer from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.

In the early eighties, it was obvious to see that the Progressive Rock era was dying if not dead already. Yes continued and had a pop album, Genesis too. Even King Crimson continued in the eighties. So, it was no surprise to see the icons of past Progressive Rock bands get together to make it big in the pop rock genre.

So, they played favorites from their collaboration as well as played some songs from their past, including Steve Howe's past with Yes, they performed ""Roundabout"". With Carl Palmer, they played ""Fanfare For The Common Man"". With John Wetton, they played ""In The Court of the Crimson King"" but I don't know why they played that particular song.  Wetton wasn't on that album from King Crimson.  He joined King Crimson around 1973. Then, of course, with Geoff Downes they played ""Video Killed The Radio Star."" It was okay, but I think that they should have had a guest female vocalist (or even the taped recording of the female backing vocal), to make that song sound more authentic. To me, it was the female voice that made that song so cool.

Anyway, the one thing I found most disappointing about this blu-ray is that, although the video quality is excellent, but the sound quality is very weak. In fact, I think it is a monaural recording. I have a great bass-intensive sound system hooked up to my blu-ray and amplifier.  But, this concert disc sounds no better through my stereo then if I just had it play through the TV itself. But, this concert on blu-ray is still worthwhile because, I love the 80's. And this band was a strong part of it's humble beginnings.",1361232000,,1970,4.576704545454546

This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12"" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of BluRay technology, Laserdiscs were the best home video format available.

Seven decades later, Walt Disney's FANTASIA (1940) remains the ultimate hand-animated motion picture, an astounding blend of cartoon and classical music. Highlight is a segment that illustrates the first few billion years of Earth's evolution, right up until dinosaurs are killed off by global warming.

Leopold Stokowski is shown in the dimmest of light while the Philadelphia Orchestra is primarily in silhouette against a rich blue screen. Halfway through the program, musicians improv some jazz, then they and narrator Deems Taylor demonstrate (with the help of an animated vertical line) what film audiotrack looks like and how its squiggling form constantly varies.

The only limitation of this classic movie is a primitive two-channel soundtrack (it's NOT true stereo) that either plays separate but simultaneously with a phantom hole in dead center, or bounces ping pong fashion between extreme right and left. Regardless, this one's a monumental achievement of pure art. Highest recommendation!

431934,5,6302158095,"Think you remember it? I challenge you to see how much you missed when you were a kid.

I remember the first time I saw this, in a theater. Most Disney memories of mine are in black and white because they were on a TV, but this one was on a big screen theater in Philadelphia. I was probably four years old, and going all the way to Philadelphia (maybe an hour away) just to see a movie was a very big deal. I remember my mother had to take me out during the fight of the tyrannosaurus and the stegosaurus, because I started screaming and crying. So it's not surprising that I didn't remember the end of that segment.

Seeing this as an adult is very, very different. I notice things it would not have occurred to me to notice as a child, like abstract parts. Remember when the narrator introduced the sound track? When he does the low notes on the bassoon (he had to be coaxed a bit), the lines not only wiggled like a tongue giving a raspberry, but had little wiggle marks like parenthesis, or maybe like saliva drops off a wet raspberry.

It's hard to remember that this entire movie was made the old-fashioned way, with acetate cells, painted one by one. Lucky collectors have carried off those painted cells and framed them as art, because they are. If I had the money to collect them, this is the movie I would most want to collect. The dancing mushrooms, certainly, and the frolicking baby unicorns, and the fairies that spangle the garden with dew. There's so very much here to love.",1336608000,,1491,4.375451263537906

431975,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is the most popular, well thought, well produced, and well organized, nicely animated Disney film. It was produced in America in 1940.  There was an updated release in 2000, but I am not familiar with the differences between the films. The music was played by The Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The film starts out with a rather long, but informative intro by music critic and composer, Joseph Deems Taylor. Fantasia gives the audience an interesting way to experience orchestra music in seven separate animated segments. There is only one segment where the music was written for the animation. Every segment is equally as great as the next. The animation is superb and will keep the attention of anyone who watches. Take note that this was made in the 1940s so producers were not so concerned about near nudity shown in cartoons or signs of racism. Or maybe it's just a Disney thing, but if you are really concerned about it, these types of images only occur briefly. Some examples are in the scene with the centaurs and the naked devils. The centaurs were in same color pairs. A black goldfish did some kind of service for the yellow goldfish. I was not easily offended by these details. It's just a part of history. From what I understand, the new version has edited the scenes and even dubbed over some narration. I am satisfied with the quality of the original film. It is rather long for one sitting so as entertaining as it is do not expect children to sit through the whole film. It's a shame there are no other similar films with the same concept of taking classical orchestra music as a muse to create animation. The whole film can be seen online for free on you tube. Fantasia (1940) is the title. Enjoy.",1326240000,,1752,4.669902912621359

Not sure whether Disney lawyers cracked down on Amazon or another distributor?  When we purchased the film, we hadn't realized that the Disney name had been scrubbed from the cover.  It turns out that this is a Korean copy of an early version of Fantasia; however, I'm not familiar with other versions to know ways in which this one differs.  After purchasing this I went back to study reviews of other versions and was interested to know that some of the new remakes were disappointing to customers - and these cost much more money!

As to the content: the film must have been very progressive for it's time - acknowedging what were probably recent dinosaur discoveries in the tar pits of Los Angelas. Also, some of the nymphets, mermaids, and female minataurs had a slight sexuality that was suprising for a Disney film.  It also seems that this was more targeted to adult audiences because of the sophistication of the content.

Through Wikipedia, we have learned that some portions of the original film have been lost, which is why many of the remakes are different.  I'm interested to research different versions of FANTASIA to better understand the ways in which it's been altered.

I'm interested in the opinions of others.  Thank you,",1325980800,4,1359,4.818965517241379

432004,5,6302158095,"Animation has been used for all manner of cinematic entertainment, from the children-targeted Mickey Mouse to the left-leaning ""Family Guy"" or ""South Park"", meant not to much as entertainment as it is meant to produce an emotional response. This film was made 7 years before I was born, but I recall not being able to see it a dozen years later during the 1950s because it had still not made it to TV and my family could not afford the first-run theaters uptown. Ads for it showed an excerpt of the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", since all kids knew Mickey. It went through a brief ""renaissance"" in popularity during the mid-1960s when the acid crowd saw its surrealistic scenes as a ""previous generation"" antecedent to their ""trips""--""Hey man, I had a trip a few weeks ago that was kinda like that. Like, maybe Disney's guys did some mushrooms back then"".
But now I finally got to see it, two generations later, at the age my grandparents were during its '50s run. There's an old saying--""Discipline is not an end, just a means to an end"", and this film is the opposite to that. All other uses of animation in popular entertainment have been but a vehicle for the story being told, whether comedy or social commentary disguised as comedy. Classical music has been used as the soundtrack of choice for animation since forever, but this film is animation built on the foundation of the music. Until I saw this film, I'd never heard an orchestral version of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue""--only the pipe organ version. Actually I've got a ringtone of an excerpt from that version. The kids might be amused by the ""Mickey Mouse cartoon"" of ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", but when it comes to them seeing the dinosaur sequences of the ""Rite Of Spring"" sketch, it might help if they've already seen one of the ""Jurassic Park"" flicks.",1307923200,,1812,4.737341772151899
432005,5,6302158095,"Of all the great experiments in filmmaking that came out of the period from 1930 to 1960, Walt Disney's 1940 animated film FANTASIA is almost certainly the most elaborate and daring to have been made of any kind, animated or otherwise.  Nothing of this sort had ever been tried anywhere in the cinema--setting largely abstract images to the works of great classical composers; virtually no dialogue whatsoever; and a running time that was, for an animated movie past or present, unbelievably long at two hours and five minutes in length.  Thus, it isn't so surprising that FANTASIA was not as successful as any of Disney's previous groundbreaking animated films; not very many people understood quite how to put two and two together when it came to this mix of classical music and animated imagery.  Indeed, Disney himself went out of his way at the 1940 Academy Awards to deem this film a mistake.  FANTASIA didn't recoup its original cost of $2.25 million (which is, in 21st century dollars, the equivalent of AVATAR--$250 million) until its fourth re-release in the late 1960s, three years after Disney himself had passed away.

In retrospect, however, FANTASIA is one of the high points of the cinema, in no small part to Disney having gotten Leopold Stokowski, indisputably one of the great classical music conductors of all times, to conduct the music for the film with his Philadelphia Orchestra.  And the works that are utilized in FANTASIA, thanks not only to Stokowski but also to the imagination of Disney's animation staff, have become concert staples since the film's release, leading off, of course, with the abstract patterns that are accompanied by Stokowski's elaborate orchestration of J.S. Bach's beloved organ work ""Toccata And Fugue In D Minor.""  With help from noted musicologist Deems Taylor, who gives a rather elaborate guide for what is being attempted in the film, FANTASIA then proceeds to weave disparate segments that are alternately provocative (Stravinsky's ""The Rite Of Spring""), comic (Ponchielli's ""Dance Of The Hours""), nightmarish (Mussorgsky's ""A Night On Bald Mountain""), and poignant (Schubert's ""Ave Maria"").  And one cannot mention this film without mentioning Mickey Mouse's appearance as the well meaning but slightly misguided ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", which earned that work's composer Paul Dukas a certain immortality in the concert hall from that point forward.

Although Disney had launched a series of cartoon short called ""Silly Symphonies"" in the four years prior to this film's release, FANTASIA was clearly a breed apart.  Beyond the merging of animation and classical music, it may also have been an attempt at introducing young people to the classical music world, a la Sergei Prokofiev's ""Peter And The Wolf"", and Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide To The Orchestra.""  What this film did initially, however, was spawn a number of imitations from competing studios like Warner Brothers (their memorable 1943 short cartoon ""A Corny Concerto"") and Universal (several Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda cartoons utilized classical works as well).  The well-meant attempt at mixing classical music and cinematic images together really wouldn't be tried like this in Hollywood again until director Stanley Kubrick utilized several classical pieces and integrated them into the fabric of his 1968 science fiction masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.

As proved to be the case with ""2001"", however, FANTASIA was, for lack of a better term, a visionary film, one clearly decades ahead of its time.  Seven decades worth of changes, restorations, alterations, and even advancements in computer-generated images (best shown in the Disney canon in their 2008 opus WALL-E) haven't changed that; and the music as performed by Stokowski and his Philadelphia Orchestra has become firmly entrenched in the popular culture.  Only a select group of films can claim such a mantle, and FANTASIA is definitely one of those films.",1306281600,,3963,5.288216560509555
432006,5,6302158095,"Make no mistake despite it flaws five stars is no accident. This is one of Walt's greatest accomplishments in animation when disregarding his other endeavors in society. However the initial intention that this film was for seems to take a detour. This was supposed to be a way to commercially exploit Mickey propelling him to a level of success that Popeye was at. Though again it becomes built on so many artistic elements reminiscent of European Art and extra vignettes that were an expansion on The Sorcerer's Apprentice that it detours itself away from its original intention. These are exceptional pieces of work there really isn't any weak vignettes like Fantasia 2000 has. Color is always effectively used,the compositions are always in-synch and work well well with the changing mood. Scale and perspective are top notch and the characters are animated effortlessly. The vignettes are to short however to flesh out or develop many of the characters.

However also take into consideration that being in pantomime is a commercial risk people need memorable voices and lines to enjoy the characters and for them to be commercially successful. Fantasia features none of this. Again the reason why it is well known is due to the company overly promoting it over the years because Walt had always wanted this film to materialize into something. Ironically it was the 1969 release that made profit because stoner's were essentially tripping upon viewing the film. It did not earn its place in animation history as immediate as Snow White or other projects did. Again it gets away from its original focus of propelling Mickey to a level of success that Popeye was at than build's itself into an elaborate production. Totally in Disney's nature but was the genesis for Dumbo as an economically safe feature that gauranteed profit.",1306281600,,1829,5.036303630363037

432022,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is two hours and five minutes long and was released on November 13, 1940. Fantasia is by far the longest Disney animated movie and the only one to day is two hours long. This was Disney's third animated film and by some Disney's famous flop. Fantasia did not earn a profit till 1969 when it was released for its fourth time. Fantasia is a mixture of eight animated shorts set to music with no dialog. The only person talking in the film is Deems Taylor during the introduction of each program description. This version of Fantasia is the roadshow version which included a fifteen intermission. The only thing missing in this ""uncut version"" is the Sunflower character; that is a centaur depicted as an African-American girl in the Pastoral Symphony segment. Also as with the original version there is no opening and closing credits; there are closing credits in the VHS version. The eight animated shorts are:

Toccata and Fugue in D Minor
Nutcracker Suite
The Sorcerer's Apprentice
The Rite of Spring
Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack
The Pastoral Symphony
Dance of the Hours
Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria

One of the reasons for its failure was due to the critics; the newspaper did not know who to send to view the film. Some sent a movie critic and some sent a music critic while some newspapers sent both. The film critics loved Fantasia and the music critics hated the movie. Another reason was not all movie theaters were equipped to handle the amount of audio equipment required for the movie. Still Fantasia is an enjoyable movie to watch and gets an A+ in my book.

I'm a much bigger fan of the ""roving foliage"" technique, as, while obvious and hilarious when you notice it, it does not burden the skill and beauty of the animation.

432067,4,6302158095,"""Fantasia"" (1940) includes some of the finest moments in animation history, yet proved a critical and financial disaster when first released. In 1990, the film's original Leopold Stokowski soundtrack was fully restored along with a pristine 35mm master print. As a result, Walt Disney's once-in-a-lifetime achievement looks and sounds terrific  particularly in the segments of Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite,"" Ponchielli's ""The Dance of the Hours"" and Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" that blend classical music with seamless animation. In terms of sheer visual brilliance, nothing beats Disney's rendition of Moussorgsky's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" and Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (perhaps the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever produced). Equally impressive is the abstract experimentation of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" based on the work of artist Oskar Fischinger. As long as Disney ventured into new and challenging directions, ""Fantasia"" maintained the sophisticated conception of an animated symphony. Unfortunately, when he reverted back to the sappy Disney formula, his ""Concert Feature"" suffered accordingly. The appalling interpretation of Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony"" (with its ludicrous centaurs) must rank among Disney's worst efforts and represents the film's nadir. Though beautifully detailed, the anti-climactic finale of Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" ends the ambitious production on a rather limp note. Despite occasional missteps, ""Fantasia"" represents the Disney studio at the peak of its artistic powers. The best segments inspire awe and wonderment unlike any animated feature.",1274745600,,1607,6.048245614035087

It's the Disney organisation's chance to correct recent film history and bring out the classic Fantasia in its original, uncensored version including the scene with the young black Centaurette servant-girl (yes, it's offensive but is a frozen moment in history which serves to remind people how an entire race was stereotyped in the past) and the very innocent 'topless' nudity in some other sequences.
I find Fantasia a mixed-bag. There are some sequences such as the dancing hippos which I totally detest. But then there are sequences of unbelievable brilliance, as in the animation accompanying the excerpts from Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker'. And there is the inspired conducting of Leopold Stokowski, who I was lucky enough to see live in concert in London's Albert Hall one great evening. My animation heaven is peopled largely by the Warners Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies crew ... but Walt did come up trumps with Fantasia.

432072,1,6302158095,"Whether ""Fantasia"" is a great /movie/ (it's really a collection of shorts) is debatable. However, none of its sequences is less than good * (including the unfairly maligned ""Pastoral""), and some are classics (""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", ""Dance of the Hours"", ""Night on Bald Mountain""). We also get to hear Stokowski at the peak of his conducting skills. ** No one has ever conducted ""Sorcerer"" or ""Night"" -- or even the ""Nutcracker"" excerpts -- as well. It's unfortunate ""Fantasia"" was a flop. Disney wanted it to run indefinitely, with the periodic addition/replacement of segments. He probably saw it as a public laboratory for experimentation. We'll never know what might have come out of it.

I'm posting this ""review"" of a not-yet-existent release in the same spirit as the premature ""reviews"" of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Blu-ray, which excoriated it for being the theatrical release, not the extended cut. Whether those reviews caused the loss of sales, or have encouraged Jackson, et al, to speed up the release of the extended cut, we may never know. But I'm hoping that my one-star review (and the hundreds I expect to follow) will kick Disney into giving us the uncensored version of ""Fantasia"".

""Unca Walt"" was neither particularly religious or political, and (for the first 20 years of his career) was nowhere nearly as artistically conservative or ""square"" as he appears today. He always wanted to do something new and different, and was not (at least initially) worried about what the audience thought. The criticism he received, from both the public and snooty critics, had the gradual effect of artistically castrating his work.

Mickey Mouse is the best example. The Mouse was such a lively, uninhibited character that parents complained he was a bad influence, and Mickey gradually became blandified to insipidity. The Duck never suffered from this, probably because he was usually punished for his bad behavior.

Disney had no objection to bare breasts, and the original version of the ""centaurettes"" *** in the ""Pastoral"" sequence had visible nipples. The Hays Office /did/ object, and the horse/human hybrids were covered up with flower necklaces. (Several of the briefly seen female demons in ""Night on Bald Mountain"" remain uncovered.)

The principal censorship issue is the portrayal of a young black male centaur buffing the hooves of a white adult female centaur. His facial features and expressive movements are exaggerations of how people of that era would have perceived a black bootblack. I find it amusing and even charming, but I'm white. **** Other people do not, and after the late-50s reissue of ""Fantasia"", the film was altered to cover up the character. Neither the LaserDisc nor DVD editions have restored it.

It's about time Disney returned ""Fantasia"" to its original form, at least on the upcoming Blu-ray, which is presumably aimed at adult buyers. Classic live-action films don't seem subject to this sort of censorship. For example, in ""You Can't Take it With You"", Eddie Anderson tells his girlfriend that he doesn't want to move anywhere that's not close to a welfare office! If there's anything worse than racism, it's pretending that it never existed. Restoring controversial elements gives parents an excellent opportunity to discuss social issues with their children.

The MPAA ratings board could help, by re-rating ""Fantasia"" PG for its scary and ""racially insensitive"" moments.

""Fantasia"" also has technical problems (including uneven film agitation) that need to be fixed, but never have been. The BD edition would offer a good reason to do so. I'd also like to see the inter-segment introductions returned to their shorter versions, with Deems Taylor's original voice.

If you'd like to see the uncensored version of ""Fantasia"", please join with me in posting a one-star review.

* Other than the insipid ""Ave Maria"", which brings the film to a blah dead end.

** The DVD included pieces that were recorded, but didn't find their way into the film. One is a breath-taking ""Swan of Tuonela"", which is almost worth buying the set to hear. Stokowski had a remarkable conducting skill -- he could get the musicians to play Very Slowly, but without a loss of expressiveness, or the music's forward movement collapsing. He used it with great musical effectiveness.

*** Greek mythology does not include female centaurs. It isn't clear how male centaurs reproduced.

**** I have no right to tell African-Americans how they should be portrayed in films, or in any other medium. But I should point out that some black people collect golliwog reproductions. Human beings (myself included) are nothing if not inconsistent.

***** No one seems to object that the crows in ""Dumbo"" are, to some degree, black caricatures, or that the head crow -- named Jim! -- is voiced by a white actor (Cliff Edwards). The crows are so hip and ""street-wise"" -- and each one has a distinct appearance and personality -- that the (possibly intentionally) racist aspects are overlooked. Stromboli's garlic eating in ""Pinocchio"" is an intentional slap at Italians, but it's never been altered or censored, probably because the stereotype has largely disappeared, and modern audiences don't see it as anything other than a corpulent character stuffing his face with food.",1272672000,19,5291,5.130081300813008

432125,5,6302158095,"After seven decades, Walt Disney's FANTASIA (1940) remains the ultimate hand animated motion picture, an astounding blend of cartoon and classical music. Highlight is an interpretation of Stravinsky's complex ""Rite of Spring"" that illustrates the first few billion years of Earth's evolution, right up until dinosaurs are killed off by global warming.

Leopold Stokowski is seen here in the dimmest of light while the Philadelphia orchestra is primarily in silhouette against a rich blue screen. Halfway through the program, musicians improv some jazz, then they and Deems Taylor demonstrate (with the help of an animated vertical line) what film soundtrack looks like and how its squiggling form constantly varies.

The only limitation of this classic movie is a primitive two-channel soundtrack (it's NOT true stereo) that either plays separate but simultaneously with a phantom hole in dead center, or bounces ping pong fashion between extreme right and left. Regardless, this one's a monumental achievement of pure art. Highest recommendation!

PROGRAM:
BACH: Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (arranged for orchestra)
TCHAIKOVSKY: Nutcracker Suite (excerpts)
DUKAS: The Sorceror's Apprentice
STRAVINSKY: Rite of Spring
BEETHOVEN: Symphony #6 (""Pastoral"") (excerpt)

Also, another point of interest is the censored ""Black Centaur"" scene (talk about 'political correctness').  Hasn't anyone seen the recent ""Donald Duck"" and WWII cartoon shorts from the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" series?  They can at least have someone come on before the movie to warn those who may be offended by an animated African-American caricature.

432180,5,6302158095,"I purchased the Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 DVDs as gifts for my 17 month old grandson for him to appreciate the music of the master composers before he gets innundated with commercial popular music.  They are animated ancestors of today's music videos, and after seeing the films, one cannot help but conjure up the images that the Disney studios created every time the the music is heard.  My ulterior motive is have the vibrant colors of the superb animation capture the attention of my grandson, and to provide him with music appreciation that reaches far beyond MTV and VH1.

Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor opens the show with animation that borders on the abstract, but marvelously combines the senses of sound and sight to increase the enjoyment this familiar compostion.  Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite already well known in its own right and Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda: Dance of the Hours, popularized by delightful and humerous characters created by the Disney studio animators that perform ballet to the music, are wonderful visual presentations of less abstract images that accentuate the rythm of the music.

The animation to Beethoven's Pastoral (6th) Symphony indeed shows the idyllic pastoral foothills of Mount Olympus populated by the Greek and Roman gods and their mythical companions frolicking without human interference. Stavinsky's Rites of Spring provides the musical score to the intelligent design of the Disney animators from the Precambrian Age to the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event.  The visual interpretation of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain provides the ultimate Halloween animation that bows to Shubert's Ave Maria with the dawn of All Saint's Day.

But the creme de la creme of the original Fantasia is Mickey Mouse featured in the title role of the Sorcer's Apprentice animating the score by Paul Dukas who in turn put Goethe's poem to music. In fact, it was incorporated into Fantasia 2000 in its entirety.

There is little to criticize in the 60th Anniversary Edition of the original Fantasia.  But one cannot help but notice the failings in the updated soundtrack in reproducing the sound of the string section of the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.  The sound is not quite as bad as chalk scratching across a blackboard, but it might have been worth considering re-recording portions of the soundtrack as an exception to the blasphemy of desecrating the original, if all attempts at eliminating the scratching of the violins using modern sound engineering techniques proved futile.  But that alone cannot reduce my five star rating of this masterpiece.",1251590400,,2653,5.26303317535545

Some years ago (how many?) it was reissued in theaters & I saw it again but only remember that I got a blooming headache. I don't remember any ""intermission"" that another reviewer refers to & there is none in the VHS copy I have.

Now I am 73, & seeing it on TV cannot of course begin to compare with seeing it in a theater. The opening sequences of fanciful fairies, flowers, etc are very satisfying & entertaining & I have remembered Mickey Mouse's bit as the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" clearly & enjoyed it again though of course for a 5 year old child it would be very much more spectacular - on the TV it was just another well-done animation.

But at 73 I have of course an altered perception from what I had as a child & much of the remaining animation quite frankly appears simplistic to me by today's standards. I am not impressed at 73 by the ""scientific"" viewpoint set to Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" (pseudo-science, in my opinion), & cavorting hippos & gators etc are a waste of time to look at as far as I'm concerned. I was totally unimpressed by the idiotic mythology that for me spoiled Beethoven's ""Pastorale"" symphony & ""A Night On Bald Mountain"" was of course not the nightmarish experience it had been for me as a child.

It's been 68 years or so since it was released, and most people tend to focus only on the events of their own lifetimes.  For those unaware, Fantasia was a huge gamble for Disney.  It was the first feature-length animated film, and the first film of any kind with stereo sound.  There was a huge effort to outfit the theaters for it, and resistance from theater owners over the expense.  The classical music it embodied was not what the average man in the street preferred.  The film opened to critical - and box office - disdain.  But Walt wasn't trying to satisfy only the mass audiences of 1940, he wanted to hit one out of the park - one for the ages.  And, he largely succeeded.

Disney originally called it 'The Concert Film', which shows what the intent was.  To let audiences experience the beauty and majesty of great music by giving them a new way to perceive it.  Visually.  Fantasia is a visual concert of eight pieces of music, in order, 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' by Johann Sebastian Bach, 'The Nutcracker Suite' by Tchaikovsky, 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' by Paul Dukas, 'The Rite of Spring' by Igor Stravinsky, 'The Pastoral Symphony' by Beethoven, 'Dance of the Hours' by Ponchielli, 'Night on Bald Mountain' by Moussorgsky, and 'Ave Maria' by Franz Schubert.

The score is performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski; the segments are introduced by host Deems Taylor.  Taylor gives a brief background on each piece, and explains a bit of what the artists were trying to do with it, interpret a definite story inherent in the music or allow their imaginations free range to fantasize.

In creating Fantasia, Disney allowed his artists a much greater range of freedom than normal. It was usual at the time for an animation studio to have a set of 'ground rules' in place regarding things such as the permissible color palettes in use.  For Fantasia, the limits were removed and the artists were encouraged to experiment and get creative.  Supposedly, one animator used jelly from his sandwich to get just the right color.

The film starts perhaps a bit slowly, with Toccata and Fugue given a more timid and less imaginative rendering than it deserves, but the rest of the film, from Nutcracker to Ave Maria, will take your breath away, climaxing with a near-terrifying version of Walpurgisnacht in 'Night on Bald Mountain', segueing into a calming return to the world of sanity and daylight with 'Ave Maria'.

If you've never seen Fantasia, give yourself a treat.  Pick this up and watch it some evening.  Turn out the lights, stifle all interruptions, and immerse yourself in beautiful, glorious music and artwork.",1232236800,2,2739,4.80982905982906

Once, when he was visiting us, I pulled this tape out of our collection of 'oldies' to play in the background while he was involved in other activities.  As it turned out, he stopped what he was doing, and sat, completely engrossed in the 'Fantasia"" video.  It soon became one of his favorites.

The animated scenes, tied in with the beautiful musical arrangements, are spellbinding, from the saga of the dinosaurs to the mythological scenes.

I watched it every day, sometimes twice, from age 2 until I was about 11 or so. I was obsessed with the music, I loved it, and now that I look back, I have a theory that when you see rhythm paired with colors like this, it naturally teaches you rhythm.

Compare this to the Baby Einstein bull..really compare them (it's not hard)

Baby Einstein music is dumbed down...beautiful masterpieces changed completely!! I DON'T GET IT.
Fantasia incorporates completely original beautiful classical masterpieces from the world's best composers.and pairs it with exactly matched cartoon rhythms...

Growing up, I naturally started playing piano well, it just ""made sense."" I was able to play commercial tunes on the piano without even thinking. I then started drums, violin and guitar. No problem.
I was always #1, always first chair, always understood, complex rhythms, etc etc.

I made an all-city high school band when I was in middle school..and also gave lessons to other students in the high school band.

I could keep going but it's too much to read.
Fantasia is an amazing amazing amazing movie and concept.
Please show this movie to your kids every day!!

432273,5,6302158095,"I have to admit, I'm an avid listener of classical music. So it's a small wonder why Disney's Fantasia is one of my favorite films. Every music sequence is pure gold (except maybe the Pastoral sequence).

Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach = My second favorite sequence, it is a mixture of abstract colors & images, live action orchestral playing, and Stokowski's acclaimed orchestration of Bach's organ music.

Nutcracker Suite by Peter Illich Tchaikovsky = Although I'm not a fan of Tchaikovsky's ballet music, this one is very good and entertaining. The dancing of the fairies and flowers and mushrooms make for a heck of a good time for the whole family.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas = This is probably the most exciting rendition of Dukas's masterpiece I've ever heard (even though a few minutes of music has been cut out of it). Mickey the apprentice dreams of being a powerful sorcerer, so he dons the hat of his master, and lets loose his magic. But, of course, no one controls literally everything that is created . . .

Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring) by Igor Stravinsky = This is my 3rd favorite out of all of them for two reasons. One is that Stravinsky is one of my all-time favorite composers, and two, The Rite of Spring is one of my all-time favorite pieces. Too bad that a mere ten minutes has been cut in order to save time. Dinosaurs, volcanoes, and earthquakes do seem to fit Stravinsky's music a bit, that I can tell you.

Symphony No. 6 ""Pastoral"" by Ludwig van Beethoven = This is probably the weakest of all the sequences. It's too cartoony, too bombastic, too cheery, and to many minutes of music have been cut out sadly. The storm scene is a nice touch, though.

Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli = Gorgeous and downright hilarious. If you don't think hippo and ostrich ballet dancers is funny, then something is wrong with you.

A Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky/Ave Maria by Franz Schubert = Ah yes. My No. 1 favorite out of all of them. This didn't scare me as a kid for some reason. Chernobog is as creepy as The Horned King from ""The Black Cauldron"", and the demonic and ghostly dancing was (and still is) way ahead of its time. The last five minutes is beautiful and ethereal = they don't make them like they used to.

432275,5,6302158095,"Film buffs frequently create lists of their 10 favorite movies. My answer changes from day to day, but there are three films always on the list: Fantasia, Koyannisqatsi, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. A a cartoon, a new age documentary, and a science-fiction drama; three completely different films.

Walt Disney's Fantasia is a groundbreaking film creating a painted ballet to accompany several pieces of well-known music. The only dialogue is short introductions to each piece by renowned musicologist Deems Taylor. He briefly comments on the composer, if the music tells a specific story, and whether Disney's animation follows that story. Music can evoke strong emotions in the listener with or without a story. Fantasia frequently creates new stories for the music, but the power of the music to arouse the listener remains. The mouse king is gone from the Nutcracker Suite, but a circle of dancing mushrooms, and bouquet of waltzing flowers is no less charming and whimsical. The primitive dances of the Rite of Spring have been changed to the struggles of prehistoric life, but the music is still powerfully thrilling. The rage and fury of demons in Night on Bald Mountain end at dawn as the serene beauty of Ave Maria accompanies the glory of a sunrise. Image and music again stir the viewer's soul.

Koyannisqatsi is the newest and least known of these three films. It is a 1982 documentary with ads that said ""Until now, you've never really seen the world you live in."". Director Godfrey Reggio combines stock footage (rocket launches, landscape vistas, building demolitions, munitions tests) with spectacular new footage by cinematographer Ron Fricke (cityscapes, commuter crowds, clouds and waves, traffic jams, assembly lines). He creates a mosaic of life in the modern industrial world and how it has become disconnected from the natural world and is now a `life out of balance', which is a translation of the title. Although the film has no characters, dialogue or narration, the dramatic editing and stirring score by Philip Glass create a great emotional, and even physical impact. I once talked my mother into seeing it with me. While she liked it very much and still comments on it, at the end of one particularly frenetic sequence she said, with a sigh of relief, ""Thank goodness that's over"".

2001 is an imaginative look at how man's evolution might have been affected by outside influences. Much of the film has no dialogue whatever. The rest has occasional patches of dialogue, with most having nothing to do with the plot. There is the TV interview, a father's phone call on his daughter's birthday, proud parents radio message on their distant son's birthday, a computer's seeming random questions while working up the crew psychology report, the rambling song of a computer having its memory erased. None of this has anything to do with the search for the source of the strange artifact first found by prehistoric apes, then later by explorers on the moon and how it may affect man's future. More important than dialogue are the amazing visuals and music. The spaceship ballets, technical hardware, and the ending star gate dance of lights, combined with magnificent music evoke the sense of wonder and awe that the vastness of space and the possibilities of the future should inspire.

A a cartoon, a new age documentary, and a science-fiction drama; three completely different films thematically that each show the power of image and music to reach the viewer emotionally.",1220918400,,3497,5.03454231433506

432297,5,6302158095,"This movie was clearly way ahead of its time when it was released in the early 1940s and I'm not surprised that it was a box-office flop at that time as it struck me while watching this that this must be the ""Sgt. Pepper's"" of animation at that time.  Another major reason for the lack of success was that the logistics of the times were not up to scratch as few theatres were equiped with stereophonic sound and probably fewer audiences still were able to stand what amounts to more than 2 hours of a collection of music videos and yet it's unmistakeable that this is simply a work of art and this movie alone convinced me that Walt Disney was a genius.

Some of the scenes were like Mickey on an acid trip and this movie was clearly targeted at an adult audience more so than say a ""Snow White"" was clearly targeted at kids.  I thoroughly enjoyed these classical music MTVs except for Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue In D Minor"" which was arranged for orchestra by Stokowski instead of in the original solo pipe organ arrangement which would have been better and the ""Meet the Soundtrack"" segment both of which should have been left off and would not have been missed.

The rest of the videos though were excellent and I found myself better appreciating the original compositions when listened together with the brilliant animation that although is almost 70 years old now still looks very impressive to me although I'm sure the brilliant digital restoration had a large part to play in it as well.  My favourite was the Beethoven 6th Symphony video with Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" coming in a close second.  Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite"" video was charming too and Ponchielli's ""Dance of the Hours"" was just hilarious!  The ""Night On Bald Mountain"" video was chilling and would give any death metal video ala the band Death a good run for its money in terms of scare value too.

What I really liked the best about this DVD though is the brilliant sound quality with Dolby Digital, DTS Surround Sound in 5.0 channels with THX quality which makes it better for me to listen to the classical music tracks off the DVD than off my cds on my high end stereo!  The picture quality has been restored very well too and so the minor imperfections were few and far between and you really had to look real hard to find them.

The special features were a real treat too with the featurette ""The Making of Fantasia"" the standout item there.  Great picture and sound quality and brilliant content make this my best and favourite music video DVD and to think this was decades before MTV and much, much better too.

I have loved Fantasia since seeing it as a kid in the late 1940s, and had hoped for a perhaps cleaner/remastered DVD copy of what I already have (the 1991 VHS 2-tape release, which is very good). Unfortunately, in excising an admittedly racist-appearing segment within the Beethoven ""Pastorale"", *this* version uses a glaringly-apparent close zoom into the artwork - which is downright ugly and pretty much ruins the viewing experience.

432337,5,6302158095,"It would be difficult to praise this film enough.  Disney took music to a new level when he imagined how music might look when animated.  The result alternates between drama and comedy, between whimsy and pathos.  The result is entertaining and fun and a grand vision of creative animation that has set a standard that has yet to be exceeded.

The imaginings in this movie begin smoothly with Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.  Disney animators imagine what music might look like, with the clever use of abstract art.  The animation for this opening number is but a small taste of what is yet to come.

The end of the Toccata takes us back to the orchestra we began with, leading next into a brilliant rendition of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, featuring flowers, mushrooms, fish and fairies dancing flawlessly and whimsically.  I find temptation to use the words imagination and creativity endlessly in this review, because each of the pieces contains incredible amounts of each.

The next selection features Disney icon Mickey Mouse in Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Mickey discovers that using magic to make his life easier has a downside.  We benefit from a wonderfully performed piece of classical music well-matched with a clever story.

Drama abounds in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which shows the creation of the earth and the evolution of species through dinosaurs.  Purists may cry foul because species that existed in different eras appear together and T. Rex has three fingers instead of two, but the combination of music and animation is expressive and chilling as extinction reaches out to claim dinosaurs.

After an intermission and an imagining of how waveforms might appear, presaging graphic equalizers and screen savers, Beethoven's Sixth Symphony provides the music for a world of mythology.  Centaurs, a Pegasus and family, cherubs, fauns, Greek gods, and assorted other creatures cavort in Grecian-inspired scenery.  This portion of the movie has generated significant criticism.  There is brief female centaur nudity and a centaur inspired by African American caricatures of the era, the latter of which would be unthinkable in modern film and the former would be unacceptable in modern children's films.  Versions released in recent decades have excised the African American inspired centaur, but the nudity remains.  I find the nudity unusual, but inoffensive.

Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours provides a vehicle for dancing ostriches, crocodiles, hippos, elephants and alligators in a classical setting.  The animation is incredibly frantic and humorous as the alligators give chase faster and faster, all the while missing out on a meal.

The final segment features Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Schubert's Ave Maria.  The Bald Mountain segment is the most dramatic portion of this film and contains elements that may be frightening to very young members of the family.  A demon appears on the mountain and raises an assortment of ghosts, skeletons, zombies and other fantastic creatures.  This segment ends with a segment showing a line of people walking through the forest to the song Ave Maria.

The 60th anniversary release is the most complete version of this film that exists.  The scenes involving the stereotypical centaur are gone, but the film quality is otherwise the best it has been in many decades.  The original Leopold Stowkowski soundtrack has been restored as fully as possible.  Unfortunately, the narration by Deems Taylor had deteriorated to the point where it was unusable, and voice actor Corey Burton provided the updated narration.  The restoration is effective and brilliant.

""Fantasia"" remains a controversial film.  Some music critics lambasted the film because of the liberties Disney took with editing of some of the music.  Disney also received criticism because of the matching of Beethoven's music with mythological themes.

The visual elements also contain aspects that are controversial to various segments of the population.  The depiction of nudity, however brief and non-sexual, always generates outcries from certain groups.  Other groups decry the depiction of pagan gods and mythological creatures as somehow promoting witchcraft and paganism.  The depiction of evolution rather than creationism also generates isolated indignation.

What critics seem to forget is that ""Fantasia"" is an artistic interpretation.  The interpretations in the film are those of Disney and his animators, and they are neither right nor wrong, they are just art.  Fortunately, the vast majority of people will ignore the undeserved criticisms and focus on the unique achievement that ""Fantasia"" represents.  I doubt there will ever be another movie with the artistic scope and vision of ""Fantasia,"" which makes it even more precious and marvelous.  This movie is a great addition to the libraries of people who can appreciate the artistic vision Walt Disney tried to achieve.

I remember being forced to see the cut version some 30 years ago when I was in second or third grade and being bored to tears. After viewing the movie again in its restored ""Road Show"" edition I have to admit I was impressed. The DVD edition features the restored interstitials of Deems Taylor explaining each piece of music and the narration makes a difference. It is also that the film has not aged at all in its turbulent 67 year history. It is as fresh today as it was for those audiences in 1940.

Fantasia was designed as a new entertainment experience. Not quite film not quite concert. The film features classical music set to the work of some of Disney's greatest animators. The selections range fronm the abstraction of Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor, to the experimental Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, to the sublime Ave Maria by Schubert.

The centerpiece and section that started it all was Paul Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. It was this section that got legendary conductor Leopold Stokowski interested. Other highlights include Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and the Pastoral Symphony by Beethovan.

The disc features an excellent featurette on the history of the film and two excellent commentaries  explaining the genesis and influence of the film on filmaking in general and animation in particular.

I was enchanted by the imagery and the beautiful classical music soundtrack, from the opening credits, all the way to the last sequence.  This was Walt Disney's way of bringing classical music to the younger generations, the children who went to the movie theaters to see his cartoons.  This presentation of cartoons with classical repertoire succeeds brilliantly on many levels.  For starters, the imagery compliments the mood of the musical pieces.

Some of my favorite sequences include:  Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky with a look at the changing seasons, featuring animated fairies, fish, flowers, mushrooms, and leaves, Symphony No. 6 by Ludwig van Beethoven with a mythical ancient Grecian world of centaurs, centaurettes (a Disney studio creation), a pegasus and his family, the gods of Mount Olympus, fauns, cherubs and other creatures and characters of classical mythology, and the Ave Maria by Franz Schubert, with subtle sunlight and naturalistic color.  I should mention that the sequence with Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky is a vision of hell.  It features a wicked demon, whose likeness was based on the features of Bela Lugosi (yes, the original Dracula in the 1930s films).  I was pretty scared, as an eight year old, when watching it.  Keep that in mind when watching it with really small children.

My verdict?  This film is a beautiful introduction to classical music, for young viewers, and compelling enough for more mature ones.  This is a throwback to another time, before the age of computer-generated graphics, and you will appreciate the great lengths the animators took to hand-draw every cell in this beautiful film.",1184457600,2,1757,5.12280701754386

432427,5,6302158095,"Sorry Disney studios, but my heading was an actual promo quip for the FANTASIA theatrical release.

I was first introduced to the awareness of the Fantasia movie while in elementary school viewing a ""prehistoric animation clip"" narrated as a seperate dinosaur documentary. Later I learned it was taken from Walt Disney FANTASIA feature. When I finally saw the movie as a whole in the theater, I was mesmerized. ""The Dance Of The Hours"" sequence was especially memorable, since no one in the audience could stop laughing at the animal ballet antics.

Being a soundtrack collector, even as a young kid, I got the 3 vinyl album issue of Fantasia soundtrack on Buena Vista label, which included a program insert that was as wonderful as the movie. It even included a fold out long colorful poster which had been used to promote the re-release of Fantasia in the 70's.

Therefore I totally agree with people's opinions that this animated feature is relevant to interests of all ages, young children and adults.

I would listen to the classic movie soundtrack over and over, picturing the fantasies in my mind. This is a wonderful addition to any childs collection, whether soundtrack, movie, or both! Do not wait!",1171584000,4,1208,4.9068627450980395

432453,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is the all-time classic animated movie. Where to begin with this one? The animation is incredible, with stunning artwork, effects, and a huge palet of colors. The storytelling is top-notch, with excellent pacing and story development. Using classical music as a storytelling tool is A LOT harder than you may think, and the Disney animators pulled it off brilliantly. Each segment of Fantasia is its own self-contained movie, and each one is a winner. Even the weakest segment (the first one) is still an outstanding example of innovation (jawdropping for the 1940's). Other than the first segment, all stand up perfectly to repeated viewings. Fantasia is an AMAZING movie, which will entertain adults as much as children (a rarity). It is fitting in an ironic way, then, that Fantasia was also Disney's biggest flop when it was released in 1940. Oftentimes truly outstanding works take many years to be be recognized as the masterpieces they are (Wizard Of Oz, Its A Wonderful Life).
  As far as the editing goes, I would like to address the Deems Taylor issue (he was the original narrator). The Disney people HAD to redub Taylor's voice, because a lot of the original recordings were LOST. NONE of the VHS or movie re-edits since the original 1940 release contained the missing narration. As they had only PART of Deems recorded narration, but ALL of the footage of Deems, they decided to redub the whole narration for continuity's sake. A tough decision, but an understandable one.
The editing in the pastoral sequence is tougher to defend. Editing out a 1940's era stereotypical black servant is the PC way to do things, but is pretending it never happened a smart thing to do? Seeing the movie blemishes and all would send a better message, and a reminder that we have advanced a bit since 1940. However, I can completely understand Disney's editing. In this sickenly politically correct era, if Disney had released Fantasia unedited, they would be boycotted and labelled racists by a bunch of idiotic mental midgets who can't fathom the simple concept that viewing the material doesn't mean you agree with what it represents. HIDING THE MATERIAL DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T EXIST, and that is something those same mental midgets will never understand (and they don't want to).
  Anyone who can appreciate true art in any form MUST view Fantasia at least once in their life. This pinnacle of Disney creativity will most likely never be topped, and stands as cinema's greatest animated feature of all time.

To be more politically correct, Disney animators have truly murdered this overall wonderful film (including the re-voice dubbing and re-placing of the narrator--with today's technology, they ought to be able to just use the VHS version and transfer that directly to DVD, even if it's not in pristine digital clarity, as they say.

432458,2,6302158095,"As I write this review, it was 5 years ago this very day that the Walt Disney Co. released the classic ""Fantasia"" for the first time on DVD as a 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  But exactly 5 years later, you can no longer purchase a legitimate, new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price, via such avenues as ebay.

As a Disney shareholder, I am one unhappy camper!!

This is the only reason I'm rating this classic 5-star film with only 2 stars.  The DVD is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least $40 or $50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under $30 (and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by).  I'm sure I'm not the only consumer that's really sick and tired of Disney's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their DVD releases.

So what am I supposed to do now?  Wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this DVD when Disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again?  I think not!  I can't wait that long, and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point.  Or, should I instead pay an insane price now for an original copy (the profits of which WILL NOT go to Disney)?  Again, I don't think so!  I do not believe in getting ripped off, and refuse to support those that profit from it, regardless of supply/demand fundamentals.

If Disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on DVD after only 2 to 3 years of availability, it shouldn't surprise them at all that they're actually LOSING POTENTIAL SALES to counterfeit/pirated versions of the films that are being sold around the world (and from auction sites like ebay, too).  The way I see it, THEY ASKED FOR IT!!  By not making these classics legitimately available at all times, they are encouraging piracy.  It's that simple, and they deserve it!!  In this day and age, people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want NOW!!

I guess Disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper DVD version of the original ""Fantasia"" just so I can show this classic to my nieces and nephews.  I'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that's reasonably priced, but I can't because Disney won't allow me to do so.  Oh well, it's their loss.  A classic film like ""Fantasia"", which came in at No. 58 on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, deserves a far better fate than this.

Great job Disney!!  Way to go!!",1131926400,18,2586,4.432203389830509
432459,5,6302158095,"The newest processes of the day may be called ancient by today's standards, but the significance of Fantasia lies in its greatness.  It is a high-quality artwork and cinematic experience worthy of the greatest auteurs.  However, not all of Disney's works were in the realm of greatness.  Combining sureal graphic imagery to pre-existing classical music proved an entirely new idea of comment.  Such significance is important  to the progression of cinema, it is a landmark of cinema history.  Fantasia develops its work for its cinematic comment.  It is as every bit brilliant as the composers and their great works.  Fantasia was something totally new and exciting for the cinema, but, in quality, remains today as a significant statement within cinema as a form of art.  Comprehension of Fantasia's essence lies in true love to the subjective form.

However, the Disney company has an obligation to Fantasia.  I believe the company demeans that obligation when it alters scenes from the movie.  I'm talking about the Beethoven segment.  The older VHS deleted a few notes of the Beethoven music when the company omitted some of the ""racial"" frames, and now this new DVD computer-colorizes one of the black animals to a different color.  I don't know why they'd do this, except to possibly protect their image.  Why does black worry them?  ""Birth Of a Nation"" is an extremely racially bigoted movie, yet still brilliant cinema.  But, the producers of that film aren't executive producers and property and trademark copyright owners that have to protect their image.  Although I think this DVD is a fine DVD except for the alterations that anger me, why has the company always been ready to ""tinker around"" with the man's (Disney's) original works?  The company makes a lot of money by selling, in essence, toys for children.  Obviously, they refuse to stand behind Disney's original works when those works might upset people.  Just because Mickey Mouse is in it doesn't mean the company is being honest with the public.",1128556800,,2019,5.021084337349397

For some reason, every time I watch it I find some reason to leave the room or fall asleep. I guess the feast that is Fantasia can be a little overwhelming.

432501,5,6302158095,"When I was a kid, I didn't like this movie.  I just didn't understand it.  It was boring.

As I grew older though, I realized the power this movie had.  It expresses so much feeling and really gets you to appreciate the arts.

Still, I don't really care much for the dancing hippo or drunken Nero animated sequences, even though they're decent.  I like the sequences that don't really tell a story, or only tell parts of stories, much better.

The first musical sequence has very random animation that I really love.  It matches the music so closely and it's just great to watch and hear.  Who would have thought you'd have so much fun just seeing specks of light flicker?  The rolling hills leave a lasting impression in my mind too.

During the Nutcracker sequence, I only REALLY like the part with the dancing mushrooms.  I'm just amazed at how much the animation matches the music here.

The Night on Bald Mountain sequence is absolutely dark and fantastic.  It's rare to see something like this from Disney.  Very, very watchable.

My favorite sequence is the one showing the creation of the earth.  The music really gets powerful as the dinosaurs are shown dying of thirst.  It leaves an unforgettable impression in your mind of what it must have felt like to be a poor dinosaur at that time.  I don't think the film makers meant for me to get such an impression, or maybe they did.  In either case, I enjoyed it.  It was very powerful.

I don't think a six year old kid will enjoy this very much, but if you like music and art, you can't go wrong with this movie.",1120953600,5,1570,4.454225352112676
432502,3,6302158095,"I deplore the fact that this is a censored, cut version of the original movie, which I saw as a child and again when it was re-released in movie theaters in Italy in 1969, uncut. I think it is phony to pretend the black centauress never existed, or was never part of the movie. She cannot be wished away or airbrushed out. The depiction was not excessively mean, though it was mildly demeaning.

Frankly, it is much worse, how close Disney comes to kitsch in much of the film. I cannot listen to Ponchielli's ""Dance of the Hours"" without seeing flying hippos and absurd alligators. Disney systematically ridiculed this piece from top to bottom. Except for the truly glorious ending, with Apollo in his chariot and Night overspreading the world in a beautiful purple cloak, the whole Pastorale Symphony is pure 1940s kitsch. All that is lacking is pillbox hats.

The Tschaikovsky, Bach and Mussorgsky segments are dazzling, though. Nutcracker is kitsch to begin with, so Disney fits right in. The Sorcerer's Apprentice began as a comic piece by the 2nd century AD Greek writer, Lucian of Samosata, so it is no great injustice to use Mickey Mouse to illustrate Dukas' version of it.

Night on Bald Mountain is one of the most powerful pieces of animation and imagery ever put on film. When Disney wanted to do it, he could come up with utterly unforgettable images. How far the Disney studios have fallen! What saccharine pap they put out nowadays! How distant this jagged, powerful, magnificent piece of work seems now!

The darkness is represented (please remember it was made during World War II).  I have a deep passion for classical music, and I have enjoyed many passages of the Stokowsky interpretation - he was a keen conductor of his days.  I have seen this movie since I was a child, and just bought the DVD in 2005.  The movie *does* stand as a brilliant piece, despite it's been made 65 years ago.  The movie ends up in a hope for mankind in the Ave Maria - a prayer for compassion.  Where would we be in a world with no hope, no faith in the good in mankind?  The mythologic material is, at its best, a very competent and original visual interpretation of the music.  See this movie as a visual interpretation of some beautiful music interpreted in a ""romantic"" period of the 20th century.  Please allow yourself to be seducted into the visual part of the music (don't listen to the music as ""music for the movie"" - this one is the other way around - instead see the movie as ""pictures for the music"").

432504,4,6302158095,"just for children!  It has developed that way in the US because of Disney and Hanna-Barbara, but it was not originally just for kids, and as it has developed in Asia and Europe it still isn't.  Look at the old 'Loony Toons', for example; a lot of the humor goes right over children's heads, but can be appreciated by adults.

To the people who say that children don't like this because there is no story line, as a child I loved it.  Of course, I grew up in a home filled with classical music--my late Mother was an Eastman-trained musician--so perhaps I was different.

As for the censorship of the black centaurette, Disney is in a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation.  Back when the film was first released, people didn't think anything of such 'humor'.  It was a different time, and it is wrong to judge other cultures by our culture's standards.  Now, of course, it is totally unacceptable.  If Disney were to release it in the original, they'd be called racist; if in the edited version, they are called censors.

Some have objected to the 'Night on Bald [or BEAR] Mountain' sequence as evil and Satanic; well, it is supposed to be.  There IS evil in the world, and the sooner children discover this the better.  And Disney does not leave us there; the demons are stopped in thir revelry by the Angelus bell, and we close with the vision of the Schubert 'Ave Maria'.

'Allegro non Troppo' and 'Opera Imaginaire' give us some idea of other possibilities of combining good music with animation; more along those lines should be done.",1119484800,3,1551,4.576086956521739
432505,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is a film that has stood the test of time thanks to its originality and the magic that is Disney. Unlike most movies, this one has no story to follow. Instead what we have is vignettes of Disney animation set to some of the best classical music to be found, played by the Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by the renowned Leopold Stokowski).

The film begins with Bach's Toccata and Fugue being played to a backdrop of kaleidoscopic images. There are no real forms to see, just random moving images that fit the music perfectly. The second segment uses more `classical' animation, and shows fairies, fish, and flowers, and so on through the changing seasons. This section has Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite as its theme. Particularly good is the `Chinese Dance' featuring dancing toadstools.

Segment three is the best known by far, Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice which is set to Paul Duka's music of the same name. Here we see the famous cartoon of Mickey trying to use magic on brooms in order to lighten his work load only for it all to go disastrously wrong as the brooms run out of control. From here, the film moves on to `Rites of Spring', by Stravinsky, and this animation shows evolution, from the beginning of the universe through to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

There is then a short `respite' in the form of `The soundtrack', a thin beam of light that changes pattern as the music alters of the instrument playing changes. Soon the movie is back in full flow with Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony set to idyllic country images, complete with cherubs, unicorns and centaurs. This section includes a dramatic scene of a thunderstorm complete with the god Vulcan hurling his lightening bolts.

Segment six has the wonderful ostrich and hippo ballets, who wouldn't laugh at the sight of an alligator trying to run off with the hippo he has `fallen' for. All of this is played out to Ponchielli's `Dance of the Hours'. Finally we end up with the dramatic `Night on a Bald Mountain' (Mussorgsky) which depicts evil being celebrated during the witches Sabbath. This section is actually divided into two and in the second half we hear the beautiful, haunting Ave Maria (Schubert) and see pilgrims crossing a bridge into a picturesque meadow. The image is one of good triumphing over evil.

This is a truly magical film, matched only by Fantasia 2000, and one that should be in any film/music lovers' collection.",1118966400,3,2437,4.8485576923076925
432506,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is one of those movies I have grown to love more and more every time I watch it. It's so unlike anything else Disney did before or after, and it's even unique compared against other animated movies. I find fascinating the fact that the visuals follow the music, something very different from the typical approach, where the movie is put together and the music comes in as an element of the post-production stage.

Then, the visuals themselves depart in radically different directions. Some tag alongside the metaphors hinted at by the pieces (Beethoven's Pastoral, for example, is visually accompanied by mythological figures that perfectly embody the idea behind the composition), and then other segments are quite simply abstract, to say the least.

When you put the whole thing together, with the whole introductions preceeding every piece, the result is a work of art, that you cannot judge by the same standards we've grown used to when watching Nemo, Beauty and the Beast or other less contemporary animation standards, such as Snow White. Fantasia created a genre on which it stands almost by itself, untouched, except by some excerpts of movies from the Japanese genius Miyazaki.",1110844800,5,1196,5.096938775510204

Many of the vignettes here are now classics. Mickey as the Sorcerer's Apprentice: that's become an icon by itself. Dance of the Hours, with hippo ballerinas? I just laughed myself silly watching that, no matter how many times I've seen it before. Night on Bald Mountain - I must have been about four the first time I saw that, and I still remember how it scared the goobers out of me. That one scene, near the end, when the demon in charge is completely lit from the front, that's that one that sticks with me. For its time, it was about the most creative thing on the screen. The 'Disney Look' is a bit dated now, but it's true to the time in which it was made.

I think today's kids might still like it, and it's a sneaky way to start them enjoying classical music. See it again with an adult's eyes, or see it again with a child's eyes. Just do yourself a favor and see it again.

HOWEVER, being one of the few people around who has actually seen the character that's been carefully edited out the the Pastorale Symphony sequence, I have to say that while it's fascinating to see the original (considering the historical context of racial humor in the late 1930's), the sudden appearance of the highly-caricatured, big-lipped, pig-tailed, subservient Black centaurette not only demonstrates a HUGE lapse of taste on the part of the Disney artists, but her 3 brief appearances are so awkward and embarrassing that in my opinion, the sequence actually flows better without her in it.  Trust me, the scenes are regretable.  I'd suggest, in all fairness, that Disney should provide the UNedited segments along with the extra archival material, with a disclaimer, so that viewers can at least see them and decide for themselves.",1101168000,8,1021,5.213414634146342

432535,4,6302158095,"Walt had a dream once: to have a marriage of music and images played at once, or in other words, to show you what you might be seeing in your mind if you were listening to the music. Theatres were outfitted with the 1940's equivalent of surround sound, which they called Fantasound. However, it was a costly affair, and some theatres didn't want to be outfitted with Fantasound. Critics were dumbfounded as they was no heros, heroines, monsters(well there is in a way) and typical Disney songs. Re-released quite a bit, it recently started to develop steam as the film is a good example of being ahead of it's time, but that doesn't mean the film is flawless either.

Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: Starts off with just the silhouettes of the players and conductors until it shows a sky with many violins syncopated to the music. Sets the tone for what's coming. 9/10

Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite: Rather than follow the traditional story, Disney followed a different approach by animating the four seasons in the form of ballet. With mushrooms, birds and these weird little angels skating on ice, it's a classic case of Disney showcasing it's talent in animation...by hand, nonetheless. 10/10

Dukas's The Sorceror's Apprentice: A newly designed(at the time) Mickey Mouse snatches his masters hat and makes a broom do his chores. Only he falls asleep and the broom overflows the room. Mickey tries to break it but the broom multiplies until the master sets things right. Classic scene. 10/10

Stravinsky's Rite of Spring: As Stravinsky said ""to show primitive life"", Disney animated the life and death of the dinosaurs. One thing that I wouldn't have mind seeing is the meteor theory, but they use the heatwave theory. When the continents seperate though, it's awesome, it just feels long. 8/10

Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony: Beethoven's lively music set to mythical creatures. I'm sure someone's already mentioned the edit on here so I won't go through it but it's far from offensive. 9/10

Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours: Dancing hippos and crocodiles(or are they alligators?). Anyway, it's a nice fun scene. 8/10

Moussorgsky's A Night on Bald Mountain: if you've ever played Kingdom Hearts right to the end, chances are he seems familiar. This is where he came from. Parent groups wanted this scene out of the re-release but I'm glad it's still in. By the way, according to Kingdom Hearts, his name is Chernabog. 10/10

Schubert's Ave Maria: a beautiful song and odd but hopeful images. It's basically these things with lightbulb heads walking somewhere until the end when we start from inside a mountain till we get outside to a nice sunrise. This was done with Disney's Multi-plane camera, which allowed for one continuous shot. It's a nice scene and a great end to the film. 9/10

Now you notice each scene got 8 or higher. But I suggest you don't watch them all at once. The movie really feels its length or maybe I'm just tired but the movie felt longer than normal. But it's still something that has to be seen.",1094428800,12,3033,4.83976833976834

The problem with ""Fantasia"" is that it's a film that adults love because they think they would have adored it as children. In fact, it's hard to keep kids occupied with this film, with its endless interruptions to have Mickey chat up the conductor. Boring for adults and unbearable for youth with short attention spans. I remember being bored to death watching it at six, and so were the other kids, because we had more fun having popcorn fights and running up and down the aisles than we did watching the movie. Try parking your eight year old in front of it and clock how long it takes him to get bored and walk away, and you'll see the real disappointment in this movie.",1092009600,10,810,4.47972972972973

The two pieces that really stand out for me is the ""Nutcracker Suite"" and ""Night on Bald Mountain"" This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys classical music.

432538,4,6302158095,"I recently viewed the 60th anniversary edition of Walt Disney's ""Fantasia"", and I think that this is the closest we will ever come to seeing and hearing Disney's original vision for this film. This DVD Edition sets things right by incorporating all of Deems Taylor's spoken introduction and linking narratives into the film for the first time since the film's premiere in 1940.

If anyone has seen the 1990 restoration that appeared on video in 1991, they will know to what I'm referring. In that edition we only see Taylor's face in the opening prologue. Later on, we hear his comments as a voice-over to medium shots of the orchestra as they tune their instruments. Those players on the screen, by the way, are not members of the Philadelphia Orchestra: they are actually studio musicians. The music for Fantasia was pre-recorded months prior to shooting in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.

The DVD presents what was then known as the ""roadshow"" version of Fantasia, which toured a limited number of cities upon it's initial release. The film's distributor, RKO Radio Pictures, balked at the added expense involved in setting up special amplifiers and speaker systems to accomodate the requirements for the Fantasound soundtrack. The decision was made to trim some of the film's length, beginning with altering the narrative links, but also making horrendous cuts in some release prints (indeed, some later prints do not even contain the Bach Toccata and Fugue sequence.) At one point, Disney decided to take matters into his own hands and handle the distribution of the ""roadshow"" version himself. That version differs from subsequent release prints in that Taylor's face is visible throughought every linking narrative; and that the blue title card appears at the start of the intermission that follows Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. In the 1990 restoration the title card appears at the start of the film. Also, the original release had no screen credits: special programs with those details were distributed to patrons. The DVD edition also doesn't have screen credits, but information about the animators is touched upon during the commentary by Rudy Behlmer, et al.

With regard to the soundtrack, the original optical, nine-track elements (which were mixed down to three tracks for the master print) have been missing for several decades. In 1955, the decision was made to transfer the extremely fragile and potentially unstable nitrate soundtracks to a four-track magnetic tape, because it was feared that the original tracks might not survive for much longer. This was done by playing the original tracks at RCA in Los Angeles and relaying the audio over telephone wires to the Disney Studios in Burbank. Unfortunately, during the transfer electronic hum and other noises ended up on the tape. Also, the telephone wires cut off at 8,000 Hz, so many viewers have never heard the full frequency and dynamic range that was capable utilizing the Fantasound system (which was a precursor of today's Dolby Surround-Sound.)

For the 1990 restoration, Terry Porter of YCM Labs had reportedly removed 2,000 clicks and pops from the four-track magnetic copy. Also, using technical data from the Disney Archives, he managed to replicate the mixing format of the original optical tracks; so that the sound would eminate from the left, right, front and rear speakers as originally planned.

I viewed my VHS copy of the 1990 restoration first, so that I could make my own comparisons. The 1990 edition suffers from too much use of noise-reduction software, which makes the violins and high wind instruments sound ""glassy"" and distorted. I also listened to my CD copy of the 1990 restored soundtrack album. The sound on the CD was a little cleaner and well defined, but the DVD has the most improved sound. One must remember that Fantasound was an experimental process. Optical tracks, in general, while offering an expanded dynamic and frequency range, were often quite noisy. All this means that what we hear is a 60-year-old recording that is by no means state-of-the-art by today's standards, but nevertheless remains impressive in its own right.

I don't remember seeing any negative racial depictions in the Beethoven Pastoral Symphony sequence, either in 1975 or in 1981 (which had a newly-recorded digital soundtrack). Then, again, Disney wouldn't have allowed anything like that in his films. The only questionable scene shows Bacchus entering with two nubile, African Zebra-type centaurettes. I can see how that might draw an unfavorable response from viewers. In fairness, however, they are not depicted doing anything of a derrogatory nature. They come in, toss some petals, and then they're gone... Some who reviewed the DVD edition claim that something was cut from the Beethoven sequence, but I can't imagine what that could be. Certainly the music itself has been truncated, but Stokowski did that only for dramatic reasons and to maintain story continuity. All of the music in Fantasia, except perhaps the Bach, was edited from the original scores in one way or another.

I said that the DVD itself rates only 4 stars. That is because the good folks at Disney are only offering the pencil tests, unused animation, and alternate music pieces as part of the 3-DVD ""Legacy"" set. The extras on the single DVD are good, but one wishes the archival materials had been included as a second disc.

Post-Script 12/26/07:

Since I first wrote the above review, I have learned that there was indeed a negative ethnic stereotype that was excised from subsequent release prints of Fantasia. A black centaurette, by the name 'Sunflower' could be seen originally waiting on one of the white centaurettes (polishing her hoofs in the manner of a shoe-shine boy, braiding her hair, etc.) as they prepared to meet with their male counterparts. In subsequent prints the images of Sunflower were often obscured by zooming in abruptly to the white centaurette (which unfortunately resulted in a temporary blurring of the picture). Original character sketches of Sunflower and frame-grabs of her excised scenes in Fantasia may be viewed on the ""Snopes"" website, under ""Disney"".",1087862400,8,6171,5.120158887785501

432573,4,6302158095,"""Fantasia"" is the classic 1940 film that features the iconic ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" short.  ""Fantasia"" is a different sort of film from anything else that Disney Studios has ever produced.  It is a very experimental film, and one that must have been very daring to release at the time (as it would still be so today).  Rather than hold to a normal sort of storytelling, ""Fantasia"" is more like going to see an orchestral concert.  ""Fantasia"" is a marriage between music and image, and this time around it is the images that are on screen that only support the music.  The music is the focus of this film.
On one hand, this is a fascinating film.  The music is conducted by Leopold Stowoski and we are taken on a journey of music with the images serving only to complement what we are hearing.  Narrated by Deems Taylor, we are told what is going to happen in each segment and what music we are going to hear.  We begin with the animation just being shapes and colors reacting to the music, giving us the impression of what we might see if we closed our eyes while listening to the music.  When we move into the next song, we are given more definite images and then the music starts to tell an actual story.
There are several excellent selections in this film.  ""The Nutcracker Suite"", ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", and ""The Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria"" are standout selections in my mind and are the ones that have stuck with me several days later.  Despite this being an animated film, this isn't a movie for young children.  They are likely to be scared by ""The Night on Bald Mountain"" and perhaps even by ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", and they may not understand or appreciate this film as it does not truly tell a story (like ""The Lion King"" does).  The bottom line is this is a good film, and an interesting movie experiment, but on the same token it is not a movie for everyone.  It is a symphony with animation.",1079913600,,1922,4.517341040462428

432575,5,6302158095,"I've written past reviews of Disney movies, and I may have mentioned that Disney has a tendency to dumb things down, but after seeing this movie, I can safely say that that has only become true in recent years. There is more nudity in this film than there was in Peter Pan by close to 10 times. More, in fact, than in any non-anime movie I've seen thusfar. By today's standards, that might be indicative of a film one shouldn't put in the ""Kid's"" section of your video rental store, but then, they did things differently back when Walt was alive. First off, I don't think Walt was aiming ""Fantasia"" at kids. I think that aside from the Mickey Mouse sketch, most kids would find the movie to be largely boring. However, I think that even if a kid were to sit through this movie, they would be in no way scarred. Although this movie contains images of nudity, violence, death, demons, magic, love, and many other things normally reserved for adults, the aformentioned material is never the subject of the piece. It's used in the same way all the visual material in Fantasia is used, to help convey the mood of the music. I think this gives me a beautiful insight into the mind of Walt Disney. He saw nothing wrong with approaching such concepts, even for kids, but he knew how to approach them tastefully.
And really, that's why I gave this grade the perfect score. Fantasia is quite tasteful. You may wish to deny this. I urge you to try. But Fantasia will beat you at every turn. No one can deny the tastefulness of such segments as ""The Nutcracker Suite"" despite the rampant nude fairies, because it gives us a look into a world of wonder. Same with the mythical setting Walt gave to Beethoven's sixth, and possibly the most contraversial of the segments; ""Night on Bald Mountain"" cannot be denied to be tasteful when looked at as what it is; a depiction of evil spirits, and how they are driven back. Eventually, I totally forgot to worry about the naked centaurettes and the flaming skulls and focused on how it made me feel, and I think that's what this movie was meant to do. If it can do it for me, you can find something of yourself in this movie as well. I think that's more than enough to earn it the grade I gave it.
If you're still worried about the damage it might do to your kid's psyche, watch it first, then if you find it tasteful (you will) show it to your kid. That's the wonderful thing about young children. If they focus on the images of some of the segments, they may see it just as Walt saw it. Worlds of mystery and wonder, waiting to be discovered.
This film is not perfect, but only because it's so old. Again, large parts of it hinge on personal taste, but it won't kill you to watch it at least once. And maybe, just maybe, while in the presence of Dinosaurs, Zeus, Mickey Mouse and Chernabog, you'll learn a little something about yourself. I know I did.",1075248000,3,2883,4.400749063670412

432577,3,6302158095,"Originally conceived as an elaborate Mickey Mouse short (only to blossom into a 2-hour feature film), Fantasia is one of the most ambitious movies ever, animated or otherwise, with its perfect marriage of classical music and animation (something that began with Disney's Silly Symphonies in 1929 and would continue to appear in Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons well after Fantasia's release in 1940). However, the film was a commercial and critical failure for the Disney studio, not picking up steam until the '60s, when it was a popular choice for college students (via 16mm prints) as a ""head"" film.
However, the film hasn't been treated well at all despite being popular for the past 30-40 years. Firstly, the film's dynamic ""Fantasound"" soundtrack (which was an optical surround-sound soundtrack printed on a separate 35mm reel from the actual video portion of the film) quickly deteriorated, and was eventually transferred to a vastly inferior magnetic tape (which has become garbled as that too has begun to decay). Additionally, Fantasia was re-edited after the initial roadshow version had run its course in an effort to increase the film's popularity with filmgoers in 1940. And finally, the Pastorale Sequence was sloppily edited in the late '60s in order to remove the black centaurettes who serve their white companions.
With this in mind, there was much hope in 2000 for a fully restored Fantasia for the film's 60th Anniversary (and the release of the sequel, the excellent Fantasia 2000). Hyped as being fully restored and uncut, it seemed as if Fantasia would finally be seen as it was supposed to be once again.
However, the Pastorale sequence remained edited, and the Deems Taylor segments were redubbed by veteran voice actor Corey Burton. While the latter change is understandable (since the audio for the expanded segments has come up missing), the former is quite disturbing, particularly since Fantasia is best viewed in an academic environment-which is also the perfect place to discuss the (thankfully outdated) social stereotypes involved in the Pastorale sequence. Given this editing, it's impossible to ecommend this DVD. However, given that Fantasia is such a vital part of Walt Disney's legacy (and also about to return to the studio vaults until as late as 2010), it's hard to imagine that anyone could hold off from buying this altered version of Fantasia before it gets discontinued.",1073001600,20,2417,5.168367346938775

We have this VHS tape and my 3 1/2 year old has almost worn it out from playing it so much.  He adores about 90% of the film (although the dinosaur part and the Dance of the Hours are his favorites) and does not seem particularly scared or bothered by ""Night on Bald Mountain"" which he will watch by himself.  He also loved to listen to the audiotape in the car.  At this point if any of the Fantasia or Fantasia 2000 music comes on the classical radio station we listen to he can recognize it and tell you which film and what part it's from.  I think that some small children will really like this movie and you need to give them a shot by exposing them to it rather than assuming they will be bored.",1069632000,6,837,4.098159509202454
432610,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is truly worth owning on DVD, a crown jewel among a treasured collection.  The first time I watched Fantasia was when I was a kid.  I was sick with some virus and my dad borrowed from the library and borught it home for me to watch in bed.  Even then, alothough the music did not mean much to me at the time, the wonderful illustrations were stuck in my mind for days afterwards.  Today, I own the DVD and it is the precious jewel that ties my personal collection together.  I can not imagine not having it now, I have grown extremely fond of it.  The Greek mythological scenes with the centuars and the gods and goddesses are absolutely breathtaking designed and are drawn with such graceful skill.  Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony ties in with the illustrations perfectly, it makes me think of a gentle and more romantic time.  The Night on Bald Mountain is frightening, though, and morbid.  For the Nutcracker Suite, the illustrations include dew fairies, dancing mushrooms, graceful fish, and frost and snowflake fairies.  this images tranport the viewer from their world and draws them into a new world, perhaps a better one.  Also, do not miss The Dances of the Hours, with dancing elephants and hippos in tutus, along with an odd couple dancing ballet together.  Even, just close your eyes and drift away on the music.  I would recommend this DVD for adults, though, and not for children.  Adults would seem to appericate the music and the illustrations more.

432611,5,6302158095,"Fantasia has always been my favorite Walt Disney film, and I was delighted when I found it on DVD.  The DVD release features the original 125 minute form with narrators' introductions between the acts, in a full screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio which is the same as the original film.
The style of this film is quite varied, ranging from the traditional Disney animation used in the ""Sorceror's Apprentice"" to the almost impressionistic artwork used with the Nutcracker suite and the abstract art used with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.  There is beautiful artistry throughout, and Disney clearly took pains to make the visual work appropriate for each selection of music.  In order, the selections are:
- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by J. S. Bach:  a symphonic form of this classic work is accompanied with animated abstract artwork.
- The Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky:  to this ballet suite, leaves, flowers, and even mushrooms dance, illustrated with ethereal artistry.  Those familiar with the ballet will see that the character of each dance in the suite is captured beautifully.
- The Sorceror's Apprentice by Paul Dukas:  this piece of program music is accompanied by an animated version of the story illustrated by the music - with Mickey Mouse as the protagonist who animates ensorcelled brooms, but then is unable to control them.
- The Rite Of Spring by Stravinsky:  in a mild departure from the traditional ballet interpretation, the animation uses the music to accompany a trip through prehistoric earth, from the formation of the planet, through the volcanic period, to the development of the dinosaurs.  While the technique is traditional Disney animation, the style is much more realistic - an interesting mix.
- Symphony No. 6, Pastorale, by Beethoven:  a movement of this symphony is accompanied by an animated interpretation of fantastic creatures - unicorns, centaurs, and pegasi - along with half a dozen greek gods in their traditional role.  The action reflects the program of the music, including the storm.
- Dance of the Hours, Amilcare Ponchielli:  This ballet music is used by some very nontraditional ballerinas - ostriches, hippos, elephants, and crocodiles.  They still dance elegantly, with rather humorous effect.
- Night On Bald Mountain, Moussorgsky / Ave Maria, Schubert:  Traditionally, the devil and his worshipers gather on Bald Mountain on Walpurgisnacht - and here, we get an impressive demon and a raft of profane followers.  As the night ends, the Moussorgsky piece segues into the sacred music of the Ave Maria, with a holy procession ending in a beautiful dawn.
Perhaps the best summary of this movie is that it's like an animated evening of dance or ballet - some dances abstract, some with story lines - with the added freedom that the use of animation brings.  This timeless classic will appeal to lovers of animation, music, and dance alike.",1065398400,36,2895,5.063157894736842

Given that the original ""Fantasia"" doesn't tell a single story, as most Disney films do, but instead interprets eight distinct pieces of classical music, it's inevitable that each viewer will prefer some to others.  (Personally I fast-forward through ""The Dance of the Hours"" and am not particularly entranced by ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" but I love the ""Pastoral Symphony,"" ""Rite of Spring,"" and ""Night on Bald Mountain""--what a gorgeous mountain devil!)  Deems Taylor, who was a noted music critic of the time, provides a clear and excellent narration, and of course the score is beautiful.  Interestingly, when rereleased theatrically during the hippie era, the movie was promptly hailed as a ""psychedelic experience"" by the counterculture, but viewing it today it doesn't seem so at all.

The opening shot is in live action, an orchestra pit slowly fills with musicians, and there's an on-camera host who actually *tells* you that this is going to be a concert- and you realize that nothing could possibly be more boring. Then you begin to see the accompanying animation, and you're taken somewhere else. And that's the beauty and the magic of ""Fantasia."" Made over sixty years ago, it still thrills, moves, and dazzles. The eight animation sequences are vastly different from each other and not all generate the same excitement (the 'Rite of Spring' pageant is a rather cold lesson in palentology; the Beethoven 'Pastoral Symphony' is stirring in music but overly dainty in its imagery), but the film leaves you breathless when all ends. The first sequence to Bach's 'Toccata & Fugue' is more abstract than concrete animation, but it gets the film off to a good start. The sequences to 'The Nutcracker,' 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice,' and 'Dance of the Hours' are just right- the latter being absolutely hilarious. The best moment is the dual finale of 'Night on Bald Mountain' and 'Ave Maria.' I always thought this sequence was telling the story of Halloween- followed with a 6:00 AM dawn of All Saint's Day. The images of the nuns walking through the cathedral-shaped forest of redwoods are a thing of sublime beauty not matched anywhere else in the movie. That last sequence hushed the entire theatre audience. Like a surreal dream.",1048550400,,1491,4.944223107569721
432615,5,6302158095,"This is truly a match made in Heaven; beautiful classic music and incredible animation, and now on DVD...I saw this as a child, only five years old, but I remember it vividly, and how fascinated I was throughout the entire movie. Of course, the dinosaur segment scared me (oddly enough, ""Night on Bald Mountain"" did not...)at the end of the movie, during the ""Ave Maria"" sequence, dazed and infused with the powerul, haunting images and sound, I asked my mother ""What happened then?"" And she said ""The World was born, and then you were born, and everything was all right."" I have had more than one occasion to remember those words, with a terrible longing to go back in time. I loved the ""Dance of the Hours"", the ballerina hippos, the Centaurs, and Bacchus being set upon by Thor, Zeus, the various gods, and the beauty of Night coming, after the storm, after the sunset, and the Goddess of Hunting, Diana, shooting her arrow into the sky and thousands of stars appearing; and she (Night) was a wonderfully soothing image, and also reminded me of my own bedtime and my mother tucking me in, safe for the night and safe from the storm; would that that were still true today!!!! This is the essential Disney DVD; along with Snow White and Dumbo and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and 101 Dalmatians...a must for your DVD library.",1046995200,,1328,4.6553191489361705
432616,5,6302158095,"One of the few good things about ""Fantasia 2000"" is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of ""Ave Maria"" is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.
Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"" which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's ""Pastoral symphony"" which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have ""The Dance of the Hours"" Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.

I believe it stands just as high as Citizen Kane in important American films.  How a US film, albeit a ""cartoon"", was able to get away with nudity and cultist revelry at the height of Hays' Code hysteria stands as an achievement that few even comprehend.  Few people love all 2 hours of Fantasia, but there are also few who don't like a single piece.  And that is a testament to art in and of itself.  Fantasia is a walk through an art gallery and a symphony hall.  Some of it may draw you to tears, some of it may baffle you and some may enrage you but at least it made you feel and think something.",1038009600,4,730,4.134751773049645

The classical compositions have been restored to brilliant clarity. The assault of color and the varying styles of animation are a feast for the eye. It is as mesmerizing today as it was when I first saw it.
Like many classics from a time long gone, it is a vivid reminder that there was a sweeter and more creative period in the 20th century when kids didn't have to tethered to computers and Nintendos to have quality downtime.
My kids and I went to see this in the theater a few years ago. Last year I bought this and the companion piece FANTASIA 2000. It was viewed on a big screen tv and was surprisingly effective inspite of the limitations of home theater.
I recommend this to anyone who wants to see Disney magic at its best. This is an excellent example of the varied talents of Disney's animation crew and a great chance to see Stokowski perform his own musical magic.",1036454400,,1009,4.43010752688172
432630,1,6302158095,"The quality and presentation of this restored version of FANTASIA is wonderful. Finally restored, unseen since the initial release, are the complete introductory sequences, including a chimes player's accident with his instrument, the orchestra applauding Mickey Mouse, and the orchestra shuffling out for the intermission. Even the original title card has been returned to its proper place, during the intermission. (Some of the narration was rerecorded due to original voice tracks being no longer available.)

But there is CONSIDERABLE CONTROVERSY over the continued censorship of the ""Pastorale"" sequence. Circa 1969, the seemingly racist shots of a black centaurette (similar to Our Gang's ""Buckwheat"") attending on the white centaurettes were cut from the film, resulting in a ""jump"" in the music. Allegedly, the 1980 release's newly recorded music soundtrack covered up the clumsy edit, so that the remaining choreography was in sync. Subsequent releases to video have used optical tricks to remove the appearance of black centaurs, so that the original music track scans properly.

In this ""restored"" version, these optical edits are still glaringly obvious. (E.g., an optical zoom to avoid the black centaurette shows you the film grain up close, in another shot, a green bush magically slides across the ground by itself!)

The film survives as a masterpiece of filmic art, and this presentation of a ""politically correct, original version"" (my description) is tempting. But Disney does this release, and all customers and fans, a disservice by inappropriately calling it a ""restored"" and ""uncut"" version, when in fact it is NOT the version that was seen in the 1940 road shows.

Let your buying conscience be your guide, but consider the significance of buying an ""original, restored"" version that is neither, and perpetuates revisionist cuts as if they never happened.",1029974400,696,1880,5.428082191780822
432631,4,6302158095,"""Fantasia"" is a Disney movie for the older crowd.  I don't think small children can truly appreciate the blend of animation and classical music in this one.  My mother says I watched it when I was little and fell asleep.  Must have been the calming sounds of violins and flutes.  :)
But she brought it back to my attention when I was twelve.  I was delighted to see sequences like the beautiful fairy and flower dances to ""The Nutcracker,"" the parade of centaurs and cupids set to Beethoven, and Mickey Mouse stirring up trouble in ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice.""
Some people balk at the restoration quality of the original film.  All I can say is this:  I remember seeing ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" sequence on the Disney Channel when I was a kid.  It was grainy, muddy and dull.  When I saw the first attempt at restoration on VHS in the early 90s, it was a HUGE improvement.  Sixty years can take its toll on film strip.  We cannot possibly expect perfection.
You may ask, why did you only give it four stars?  I will tell you why, and I will tell you that I will feel this way until the day that I die.  I absolutely despise the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence.  I thought it was too scary, too evil to be part of a collection of much lighter cartoons.  I have only watched that sequence all the way through ONCE and that was enough.  It gave me nightmares for days (and now that I'm thinking about it...oh, not again).  I'm not overly religious or anything, I am just not a fan of cartoon demons.  Even at 22, they still scare me.
Even though the ""devil"" cartoon haunts me, I do enjoy the rest of the film.  Each animated clip is perfectly suited to the musical piece, creating a synchronicity between art and music.  It paved the way for the more technologically-advanced ""Fantasia 2000,"" another great film that unfortunately lacks the hand-drawn authenticity of the original.  ""Fantasia"" was one of many of Disney's revolutionary cinematic statements.",1027987200,8,1959,4.604046242774566
432632,5,6302158095,"Walt Disney's highly ambitious venture into the marriage of animation and classical music is part acid-trip, and part experimental indie-film (long before either term was coined). Though flawed with a questionable format echoing a concert presentation and often tedious narrative by Deems Taylor, this often misunderstood film truly shines in DVD format as the crown jewel in the crown of the golden age of animation. Watching with commentary by John Canemaker, Roy Disney, and James Levine provides for a new 'insider' understanding of the film as well as placing each selection within historical context in regards of what was happening in art, film, culture, and music at the time. There is also a seperate commentary of quips from Walt Disney compiled by Canemaker which, while a good idea to put in such a feature, seems a little too patched together. The 'Making of' Featurette provides little new produciton material or drawings outside of what already exists in books and other similar 'making of' films but is interesting nonetheless. The film itself never looked better. Each stipple of drybrush and airbrush reads clearly and the often bold, crisp lines of the cel animation are like no other previous version. The sound, while muffled at times by the 'Fantasound' development of the studio in the late 1930's is the most pristine version of the recording that I have heard. With the additional Deems footage, and the inclusion an actual intermission, it would seem that this is THE version of Fantasia. Get your frame-by-frame button ready.

An interesting footnote: Although the box reads ""Uncut"", it is apparent in the Pastoral sequence that some editing was done in the sequence where the ""Centaurettes"" parade for their suitors. This is due to the appearance of a stereotypical pickaninny female Centaur who tends to the others. In one scene in particular as Bacchus struggles up some stairs, it seems as though she was digitally removed altogether having seen the film before when the same scene was tightly cropped. Whether the elimination of the character by the current studio is sensativity to Black audiences or over-political correctness and a white-washing of history is for the viewer to decide.",1010016000,2,2220,5.149584487534626

Apparently, the audio portion of the restored segments was unsalvagable, and the re-dubbing was done for consistentcies sake. Too bad.

432652,3,6302158095,"Don't get me wrong -- this film is fantastic, and by itself it rates 5 stars. But this DVD edition is not all its cracked up to be.
First, there's the editing in the Pastoral Symphony, as noted by other reviewers. This is nothing new -- that editing was originally done back in the 60s -- but it makes for some very grainy frames in an otherwise beautiful print.
Then there's the re-dubbing of Deems Taylor's parts. As I understand it, this was necessary because the original soundtrack was missing for parts of the extended interstitials. However, I can't believe that they couldn't find a better voice match for Taylor, given the wealth of voice talent in Hollywood these days. If you're used to the original, the difference is kind of jarring.
My biggest gripe, though, is the apparent re-mixing of the music. The original soundtrack was full-on surround sound (what Disney called Fantasound) that had the music literally surrounding the viewer, often sweeping about the room to follow movement on the screen. The 1990 theatrical and video releases  contained this Fantasound mix, but the DVD seems re-mixed as a static symphony recording, with the rear channels carrying only reverb. The sound is a bit cleaner than the last go-round, but it's far less dramatic. And the differences are noticable even in plain stereo.
All of these things add up to considerably less than a faithful rendering of this film. The editing is understandable since racial stereotypes are unacceptable these days, but the rest is a shame, and hard to understand in view of Disney's usual attention to detail.
As I noted, the film itself is well worth seeing, and aside of the editing, it has never looked better. But the original laserdisc/VHS release is far more interesting.",978393600,108,1757,4.895973154362416

432677,5,6302158095,"Many reviewers (not just here) have complained that Disney did not make an effort to digitally remove artifacts such as scratches and crawling cel dust in this DVD edition.

Well, I own the old CAV laserdisc from the early 90s -- the big boxed set -- and a direct A/B comparison (getting the laserdisc and DVD in sync and switching back and forth on my TV) shows that this criticism is UNFOUNDED.

Disney has DEFINITELY removed much of the crawling cel dust and scratches inherent in the early 90s video transfer.  The film looks marvelous.  Only the Pastoral segment seems like there isn't much of a difference between the old and new transfers (a shame -- there are quite a few specks in that sequence that could have been removed), but the Nutcracker Suite and Sorcerer's Apprentice segments, in particular, have clearly had much of the dust and scratches elimnated.

** SPOILER **

I mark this as a spoiler because I really might not have noticed if I hadn't read about it in advance.

The issue here is the Deems Taylor overdub.  Disney found the footage for the full-length introductions by Deems Taylor, which were drastically cut down after the original roadshow exhibition in 1940, but was unable to locate the audio for the segments.  In order to restore the film to its original length, it was necessary to have an actor dub over Deems Taylor's voice.  While the actor does have a similar-sounding voice, it was not similar enough to have him re-record only the missing dialogue.  So they dubbed over the entire Deems Taylor vocal.

I agree with the decision to do this, but I'm not so sure they couldn't have kept Taylor's original vocal for the introduction to the first segment in the film, which was the only segment where his dialogue was NOT edited down, so it could have been retained.  I feel that the new actor's voice is similar enough to Mr. Taylor's that the five-minute lapse between his introduction to ""Toccata and Fugue"" and his introduction to ""The Nutcracker Suite"" would have erased the difference in the viewer's mind.  But, as I said, if I hadn't been told about it I probably wouldn't have noticed.  While I wish they could have located the missing segments of Taylor's vocal, I'm glad they restored what they had -- they did the right thing.

This disc -- especially the 3-disc Anthology, which is what I have -- is still WELL worth having in your collection.",975801600,3,2393,4.688995215311005
432678,5,6302158095,"Walt Disney's visionary masterpiece is as enduring today as when it was first released in 1940.  Though one might assume that this is a film for children, it really knows no age, and it is just as enjoyable for adults.  The combination of beautiful classical music led by renowned conductor Leopold Stokowski, and amazing animations from the Disney team is a banquet for the senses.
What is so amazing about this film is how far ahead of its time it was.  Disney had already pioneered the concept of bringing classical music to children with ""Silly Symphonies"" which were animated shorts set to familiar classical pieces.  He had developed the Multiplane camera, which allowed animations to appear as if they had depth.  He had assembled an enormous team of animators and redefined the industry.  Everything was in place for a chance meeting with Leopold Stokowski that flowered into a collaboration of obsessive geniuses that would become Fantasia.
Fantasia really consists of a series of enchanting animated shorts, each adapted to a particular piece of classical music.  There are free form abstract interpretations like the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Johann Sebastian Bach), a Mickey Mouse version of the Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas), and interpretive pieces such as the Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven) and the Nutracker Suite (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky).  The selection of the music and the animators' perfect synchronization of the visual images produce a magical and seamless product that makes it seem that the music is written for the images rather than the other way around.
Another groundbreaking concept was the sound.  Disney invented a system of multiple tracks that he called Fantasound, that placed microphones throughout the orchestra and recorded each track separately.  The theaters were then fitted with numerous speakers all around the room that made the sound feel as if it was coming from everywhere.  With this, Disney created surround-sound fifty years before its time.  To understand what an achievement this was, one would need to understand that simple two speaker stereo hadn't yet been invented.  The DVD was re-mastered from Disney's original Fantasound soundtrack making the surround-sound spectacular.
The animations were nothing short of miraculous.  There was neither digital technology nor computer graphics in 1940.  Each frame of the film had to be individually drawn by an animator.  One frame took an animator about three hours to complete and there were 24 frames per second.  That meant that each second of the film required three full days of labor to produce.  The work necessary to produce the smoothly flowing images we see is mind-boggling.
The DVD contains a fascinating featurette on the making of the film, including some priceless footage of Disney interviews.  He poured his soul into the project and he was crushed that Fantasia was a financial failure when it was released.  He endured the negative criticism of its artistic value with great anguish.  Little did he know that it would be re-released countless times and eventually become a pop cultural institution.
This is a joyful assembly of imagination, invention and dedication, which has left the entire world richer.  It is the consummate animated experience.  My rating is 10/10.  It is one of the few DVD's that I own.  Buy it today and marvel at its timeless magic.",975283200,11,3396,5.175824175824176
432679,3,6302158095,"It was great to see all of the narration put back into the film, but this so called ""Uncut"" edition, is not what is seems.  Being a life-long fan and collector of ""Fantasia"" items, I was shocked to see (or not to see), the small black centaurette pyganinnies, totally removed from the film in the ""Pastoral Symphony"". Disney's ""pan & scan"" techinque in one sequence chopped them out and when Bacchus is ushered up the stairs, they have been totally wiped out of the segment (the carpet now rolls itself up to the throne...ah,Disney magic).  I have many of the above mentioned sequences on video and was really hoping that they would find their way back into the DVD ""uncut version"".  I realize that in this age of 'racial discrimination"" that certain things can't be shown or referred to, but give me a break, ""Fantasia"" is art and should not have been censored, besides, these are mythical creatures. Also,......I remember Deems Taylor as having a different voice, the one in the DVD really does not sound like him at all.  Anyway these are my thoughts. Having waited so long for the ""uncut version"", I feel very let down.",974851200,3,1123,4.656565656565657
432680,5,6302158095,"Fantasia is an extraordinary and truly unique motion picture experience. Animation, before and since, has held a role in telling stories on screen, but too often the art of the animation itself takes a back seat to the story or situation it presents. Walt Disney understood this, and so offered the public another idea with Fantasia: an exploration of animation as a high art in and of itself. The film is a collection of seven shorts, set to various works of classical music, each considered masterpieces themselves. The music was conducted by Leopold Stokowski, who, at the time, was to classical music what Disney was to animation: a showman who knew how to bring his medium into the mainstream public. Also, this was the first film to try a stereo, ""surround sound"" approach to the sound, as Disney wanted to blend the essences of a movie and a concert. Disney had a seperate team of animators on each short, so the styles differ from piece to piece. There is, in fact, very little connective thread among the works, but each offers itself to the art of animation in its own way:
Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"", originally written for organ and best known for its ominous opening melody, becomes in Fantasia a flowing abstract as it follows a listener's perception and feeling of the music.
Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite"" is stripped of the ballet's story, and given over to the dancelike beauty of nature: mushrooms, falling leaves, graceful fish, flowers on the water's surface, and the fairies gracing the world with morning dew and bringing the changing of the seasons. This is easily the most beautiful and breathtaking sequence in the film.
Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is a Mickey Mouse short that began the whole endeavor. Eager to bring Mickey back to the spotlight after Donald Duck had taken over, Disney planted him in the tale of a lad who knew enough of his master's skills to start the magic going, but not enough to stop it.
Stravinsky's ""The Rite Of Spring"" was a ballet depicting a ceremony among a clan of primitive humans. Disney's crew uses the music to illustrate the history of life on Earth, up to the extinction of the dinosaurs. A scientifically dated piece, to be sure, but arresting visuals complement Stravinsky's innovative score.
Beethoven's 6th Symphony, the ""Pastoral Symphony"", gets set in the countryside of Ancient Greece, and the supernatural creatures that inhabited it: centaurs, winged horses, even gods like Dionysis, Zeus, and Artemis make an appearance.
Ponchielli's ""Dance of the Hours"" is taken as just that: a ballet that effortlessly segues morning, afternoon, evening, and night. It is a testament of the animators' talent that they could make dancers such as hippos, elephants, and alligators to lithe and graceful. And hilarious.
The final segment is the battle of Good and Evil, set to Moussorgsky's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" and Schubert's ""Ave Maria"". The ""Bald Mountain"" sequence is the most powerful, disturbing, nightmarish animation ever to come from Disney's studio; not fully scary as much as truly harrowing. The Schubert is lush, soft, and holds comfort and hope. The greatest flaw in the film is here, not in the animation, but the music: new English words were written into Schubert's melody. But this is the sole detractor.
For the DVD edition, the original version, freed from the later cuts and revisions, has been restored and remastered. Despite the age and poor quality of the original master, the film is more beautiful then ever, in both sight and sound. The featurette is insightful, as are commentaries by Roy Disney, James Levine (who conducted Fantasia 2000) and Walt Himself.
This is probably the greatest animated film of all time. Anyone interested in animation - or quality filmmaking - should know this one by heart.",974246400,4,3814,4.97962382445141
432681,5,6302158095,"There are movies that you watch to be entertained... there are movies that you watch for the action, story, and characters.  This is a movie that is  to be appreciated... It's the animated equivelant of going to an art  museum.
Fantasia, first realized in 1940, is several beautiful vignettes  set to music, with no dialogue.  Some times it is funny, often it is  amazingly drawn.  This movie is meant for those who enjoy art for art's  sake.  While there are some sections with a plot to them, Fantasia is more  of a ""music video"" for classical music than a feature film.
I  highly recommend this DVD.  It is a timeless classic that should not be  missed.",968889600,9,656,4.551724137931035
432682,5,6302158095,"Not only is this the greatest piece of animation Walt Disney ever made, it is also one of the most original and daring works of art in all of history.  Perhaps only Manet's Olympia, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring or Kubrick's  2001 approach it in terms of artistic risk.  The abstract animation of the  opening sequence is an amazing step for a mere ""cartoon.""  There  is humor, real drama, and even death.  And the whole thing has a peculiar  coherence.
Some of the segments don't work as well as others; I didn't  particularly enjoy the interpretation of Night on Bald Mountain and I've  never been all that much of a fan of the Sorceror's Apprentice segment.  But, ultimately, that doesn't matter; Fantasia is as innovative a work of  art as anyone has ever made, it remains my favorite movie of all time, and  I'm delighted that it's finally on DVD.",966988800,12,850,4.624161073825503

Don't let the kiddie  sequences fool you -- they're also a vital part of the experience -- this  is an Adult film (and I'm not talking about those topless centauresses)  that works on many different levels of perception.
