7886662,1,6305269106,"It appears that this is a copy.  The case artwork appears to have been copied from another source and the artwork on the DVD is a label as opposed to being screened on the DVD.

Had I know I would  not have purchased this product.",1127001600,2,230,4.066666666666666
7886663,1,6305269106,"before you send off over $100 for one of these DVDs, read the reviews and wonder why the sound quality is poor and the price so high - could it be that these DVDs are being pirated from the original VHS release in 1993? My info is that the licences were not renewed so the programme has not been officially released on DVD - which would have given the distributors the chance to clean up the soundtracks and the picture. buyers beware!",1106870400,8,435,4.317073170731708
7886664,3,6305269106,"The footage is good but camera mainly focuses on Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, Clapton is usually in the background. A bit of a pain when you hear Eric playing but only see Jack or Ginger, ugh. Good if you need the historical/documentary value. In the meantime play Live at Hyde Park, Unplugged, 24 nights or Live at Montserrat for your Clapton fix.",995068800,7,348,4.5396825396825395
7886665,5,6305269106,"I just signed on to ALO & found the reviews for my video version of ""Fresh Live Cream"" - delighted that you guys liked it, can't tell you how extraordinary it was for me to make the video, find the lost footge & clear the band - God was totaly on my case for that one - I also make a TV verson, including 2 x tracks from Hall Of Fame Reunion, which I prefer to the video as more narrative, the distrbutors decided to release DVD without my knowledge, which is a shame as I would have added loads of more stuff - anyway it was fun & one day I will recut my own multimedia version to tell more of the 'true' story. Peace & Love. Martin Baker",987552000,15,639,3.923076923076923
7886666,5,6305269106,"Fantastic DVD.  A real tribute to the band, their music, and their effect on rock and roll, even though they were only around for 2 very short years.  A very nice job of interlacing archival footage of the band with interviews from all 3 members in 1993 to cover the entire history of the band.  The live video footage must be accepted for the time in which it was recorded.  Even still, knocked my socks off.  Actually adds to their historical impact.  Almost all of the live songs are full length.  A nice treat.  They all talk about wanting to reform the band after playing at their induction into the rock and roll hall of fame.  Maybe someday...  A must have for any Cream fan, and anyone else interested in the roots of modern times rock and roll.",980467200,9,753,4.391304347826087
7886667,4,6305269106,"Ive been a Cream fan for well over 15 years, and this Video (or DVD) is a great source of info on the band and it's short but powerful history. I was very glad that there was not much footage of the Albert Hall Concerts as they really were very poorly filmed (camera and post production went overboard on special effects) and the band just did not have much drive by that point. The footage that is included is impressive. As could be expected, you won't be getting THX or SurroundSound or much of a digitally remastered experience here though. Accept this as the most definitive to-date documentary on Cream out there. The interviews were very well timed and inserted with a bit of taste and appropriate moderation. The only thing id like to see more would be an entire live concert from start to finish with no narraration or heavy handed editing...",977184000,18,851,4.568627450980392
7886668,4,6305269106,"It's amazing how many releases of Hendrix material there has been and yet Cream has been largely ignored or treated shabbily. This video is the happy exception. The highlights are the ""rehearsal"" songs performed live with no audience. Although only one camera and substandard sound was used, it's still the best footage taken of the group. And it's worth the price of the disc alone. The emotional interviews with each member is icing on the cake. And the context setting for their music and roots is excellent. If you're an old baby boomer like me, it'll bring a tear to your eye. If you're a bit younger and want to see why they were indeed the Cream, this will do it!",965347200,3,670,4.545454545454546
7886669,4,6305269106,"Great for seeing Clapton at his ""guitar god"" peak.",962236800,3,50,4.666666666666667
