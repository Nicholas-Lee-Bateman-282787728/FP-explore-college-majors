8633037,5,B000OIRQE6,"This was a gift for my rail-enthusiast husband. He LOVED this DVD so much, he wants to find another by the same makers. He has many, MANY railroad dvds, but loved the narration and detail of this particular dvd. We've visited Horse Shoe Curve and think the video captured detail very well. He now wants to visit Sand Patch Grade area. This is his favorite among his collection of 50+ railroad dvds.",1347840000,,398,4.541666666666667
