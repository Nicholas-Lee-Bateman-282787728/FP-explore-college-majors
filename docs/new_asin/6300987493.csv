301765,5,6300987493,A film well remembered from high school days -- one that has stuck in memory ever since.,1284681600,,88,4.235294117647059
301766,3,6300987493,"Once again, Brian Donlevy (""Dan McGinty"") provides pretty good entertainment. He isn't one of the more famous actors of the classic era but he did his share of good films and good performances. This certainly ranks among his best.

Donlevy, fellow actor Akim Tamiroff and director Preston Sturges all combine for a good movie All of that makes it a surprise there are so reviews of this film on this website.

The story of McGinty and his wife ""Catherine"" (Murel Angelus) also turns out to be nice with a unique twist to the relationship.

To be fair, however, I have to admit I liked this far more on the first viewing. When I looked it at 6 years later after watching thousands of other classic films, this just didn't come across as that strong. The first thirty 30 minutes was good with some snappy dialog but then it bogged down with that marriage-for-convenience angle and the politics got really sappy. So beware: you might really enjoy this, or you might find it really stupid. It could go either way, but if you are classic movie fan, you should consider checking this film out.",1234569600,,1087,4.6217616580310885
301767,5,6300987493,"Preston Sturges's first film as writer AND director (he sold the script to the studio for $10 for the privilege to direct it), and although the script won the Academy Award, it's a tribute to just how great Sturges's movies are that this one is not up to the wackiness of his later ones, though for anybody else it would be a gem.

A poor young tough guy, Dan McGinty (played by Brian Donlevy) gets himself noticed by some mob bosses after he votes 37 times in an election for two bucks a pop. He begins working for the boss (Akim Tamiroff) as a collector of payoff money, and is then pushed into politics. Eventually he gets himself elected mayor and then governor; but then he has a turn of heart and decides to cut out the graft and go straight. Of course, this doesn't wash and he is forced to flee the country for South America (where he tells his story in flashbacks) or face jail time in the States. It would take Sturges a couple of pictures to really hit his stride - he seems restrained here where later he would let it all hang out - but it's a terrific comedy anyway. Well worth a watch.",1136678400,2,1099,4.258373205741627
301768,4,6300987493,Preston Sturges was one of the great directors.  This movie is not his best but gives such a taste of things to come.  It's so good to see Brian Donlevy play something besides a heavy; he's wonderful playing a complicated man.  Akim Tamiroff is so funny.  What a great political film.  I vote for this and all Preston Sturges to be on DVD and I hope it's soon!,1099267200,7,360,4.235294117647059
301769,3,6300987493,"saw where the pattern of Sturges movies began. Take a good solid concept, in this case, political corruption, write a good script around it & satirizes. This formula can work for a long time if you don't take it too seriously & become preachy. Stuges doesn't, he makes it entertaining & funny in the style of its time. Briefly, in this case a bum, literally, thru cunning, intrique, shady dealings, & the help of stupid politicians rises to the heights of political power. It's your rags to riches to rags story. Some of the slapstick shtick is just silly, so I give it 31/2 stars instead of four.",1088553600,4,597,4.537037037037037
301770,4,6300987493,"But after that I think that 'McGinty' is a nice film, well done, but certainly not as richly written as 'Hail the Conquering Hero' and others.
 The lead female character is lacking in chrisma and spark, and the film feels that it is groping along to a nice, funny little ending.
 But, I do love two shots in this movie, one is where McGinty is calling on a 'Interior Decorator' (a lug) to get him to pay some protection money, he rings the bell and Sturges cuts to him as seen from the inside of the glass door, its just a cool little shot.
 The second is the shot from the interior of a moving call as McGinty exchanges punches with the Boss in the backseat as the car rolls up to a Hotel. A interior shot from the insider of a real moving car was very rare in those days. You can see that Sturgis was just full of little ideas of camera placement in this film.",1051315200,,862,4.119047619047619
301771,4,6300987493,"After writing several sucessful Hollywood scripts, hotshot Preston Sturges took his first crack at directing, in this crisp, typically cynical, intelligent 1940 debut. The Great McGinty is one Dan McGinty, a down-and-out, yet tough-as-nails tramp who finds opportunity handed to him on a silver platter when a the boss of a big political machine sees McGinty's potential, and taps him to be one of his many henchmen in a statewide graft ring. Affable, savvy, and ruthlessly ambitious, McGinty rises to the top, eventually riding into the governor's office on a hypocritically-fashioned ""reform"" ticket. Naturally, a woman softens him up, and brings his downfall. As usual, it's difficult not to compare Sturges with the equally populist director, Frank Capra, especially as the plot of this film closely mirrors that of Capra's ""Meet John Joe,"" and other Capra films. How do they stack up? Well, Sturges's story is in certain regards darker, in others less harrowing. His bum-made-reformed-conman starts way more corrupt, and never really softenss to the degree a Capra hero would... He finds his moral center, but not his actual salvation, and the film doesn't have what you'd exactly call a ""happy ending,"" at least not for the hero himself. Other elements are similar, though, particularly in the skillful use of supporting character actors. Particularly appealling here are Akim Tamiroff as the political boss and William Demarest as the stooge who first recruits McGinty. Brian Donlevy, as McGinty, is adequate, but hardly as appealing as some of the actors Sturges would work with later on. Still, a nice example of the Sturges formula at work.",1043625600,8,1650,5.230188679245283
301772,5,6300987493,"Stunned to see no reviews for this brilliantly funny movie. The conventional wisdom on McGINTY is that it's lesser Sturges, more important as his directorial debut (one he did for next to nothing just to get the shot) than as a standalone comedy. Pish and tosh. This is a supremely satisfying comedy and had it been Sturges' only directing credit, would still mark him as a filmmaker to remember. (And, no, that's not a subtle swipe at his others, merely a defense of this too-often overlooked movie.)Maybe the best asset of McGINTY is its budget constraint, which steered Sturges towards the 'ensemble' casting which would become one of his hallmarks. The movie is filled stem to stern with sharp-eyed turns by primarily supporting players (including the leads, Donlevy & Tamiroff, who are excellent). What I can't help but notice is how the Sturges films of the 40s are really the last gasp of the great breakneck comedies of the pre-Code 30s, just prior to the 'screwball' era, when Hollywood was still allowed to poke fun at people/institutions/conventions of the Real World. In fact, McGINTY -with only minor casting changes- would have fit right in with the Warner Bros/First National bumper crop of fast, cynical comedies of '31-'34. (And, by the way, Tamiroff's cheerfully corrupt and malapropping Boss would be paid hilarious homage 20+ years later in animation form as Boris Badinov in Jay Ward's ROCKY & BULLWINKLE cartoons.) The love interest of Muriel Angelus, and adjoining subplot, may come off a bit treacly, but Sturges was canny enough to make this studio-mandated mawkishness an integral part of the plot...even as early as 1940, he was subverting True Love to his devilishly satiric purposes! So stop nitpicking and thoroughly enjoy one of the great American comedies, brought to unforgettable life by that great if unrecognized repertory company, The Sturges Players (featuring, among others, Wm Demarest, Thurston Hall & Arthur Hoyt).",954720000,9,1956,5.1347962382445145

7808627,5,6300987493,"This movie is about corrupt politics.  The movie marks the director debut of Preston Sturges who also wrote the screenplay and was awarded an Academy Award for it.  The movie stars Brian Donlevy who had a stellar movie career.  I don't wish to be in any way a ""spoiler"", but Brian Donlevy has one scene with a child that I found particularly touching.  As a viewer, it made me feel that there is no amount of money or fame that was worth what the character had to give up.

Brian Donlevy and another actor, Alan Tamiroff, replicate their respective roles in a different movie that standson its own, ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"".  That movie is well worth viewing after this movie.  It is not a sequel, but if one watches them in order, one may find the experience very amusing.

Thank You..",1501200000,,793,4.496503496503497

7808629,4,6300987493,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my Wife.  She is a distant relative of Brian Donlevy, so I figured one of his DVDs would be a nice gift.  This film is considered to be one of his best performances by the critics.  I like it because he isn't playing the heavy like he does in many of the film noir movies he was in.  Brian was great in roles which allowed him to play a more comedic role.  This is not a true comedy, but it does have some levity.  I particularly liked Donlevy's character early in the movie, when he was essentially a bum on the street.  Overall a great classic film.",1495497600,,583,4.017391304347826

7808631,3,6300987493,"Recently I wrote in a review of another of Preston Sturges films, the dark comedy Unfaithfully Yours that those readers familiar with my music, book and film reviews in this space know that when I come across musicians, authors and movies that I go crazy over I tend to go out and grab every available other piece of material done by them. So in a short period of time, for example, you would get maybe ten reviews running of the legendary hard-boiled detection writer Dashiell Hammetts work (and maybe more for older work as some previously unknown work like some of Hammetts very early writing see the light of day whether they should have or not). Right now I am hot on the trail of the king of the 1930s and 1940s romantic screwball comedy writers and directors Preston Sturges after having viewed his classic Sullivans Travels with Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake (she of that then 1940s fashionable tuff of hair hanging over the right eye) and now several other offerings.

The film under review, a short writer-director political/social commentary film The Great McGinty, is not anywhere in the same league for political and social commentary as the formerly mentioned McCrea-Lake film, but had a rather good performance by lead actor Brian Donlevy as the literally rags-to-riches-to rags McGinty of the title and another stand-out performance by Akim Tamiroff as the world weary and wise big city boss running the politicians like a yo-yo. Although the film lacked enough subtle and witty dialogue to, well, pay off a single grafter.

That single grafter reference as was the concert hall reference in Unfaithfully Yours (and the cup of coffee reference in another recently reviewed Sturges film, Christmas In July) was no accidental remark since this film centers on the ups and downs, that rags to riches to rags career mentioned above of the great McGinty. That career started out simply enough when the from hunger Great Depression hobo McGinty was recruited to vote for the current mayor in a big city and get paid for doing so. The trick: whomever he was voting in place of was dead, gone from town or incapable of voting for some other reason adding measurably and an surely to the mayors election. A favorite and time-tested trick in the old times of ward-heeler politics. McGintys trick: vote early and often and in the process make a small killing, small killing for a from hunger hobo which brought him to the attention of Mister Big, the boss of bosses, in city politics (the role played by Tamiroff remember).

That beautiful friendship would lead McGinty to some fame and fortune, mainly fortune as he rose in the political world all the way to Governor of the state, if you can believe that. Of course the down side as I already telegraphed with that rags to riches to rags wa that McGinty was telling of his ups and downs story down in some sunny South American spot where he had been forced to flee to in order to avoid going to jail for signing all those sweetheart contract for bridges to nowhere and the like. He was telling this autobiographical to a fellow ex-pat who was also on the lam for some illegal caper along with his girl as McGinty served them drinks. By the way guess who was sitting in that same barroom. Yeah, that Mister Big who also had to take it on the lam when the heat came down. A cautionary tale for sure.

But wait a minute as I pointed out above (and elsewhere as well) this is a Preston Sturges vehicle and down below the surface plot is a tale about getting ahead in this wicked old world, about big cloud dreams, and about America being different, that last best hope of democracy that Lincoln was always going on and on about. But also about romance, a staple of Sturges films. The romance here centered on an ambitious secretary, a divorcee with kids, whom McGinty married originally as a marriage of convenience for an up and coming politician (although the divorcee part in real life would have been problematic in those days) but flowered into a real romance. Of course when McGinty was forced to flee south of the border he was forced to give her and the kids up too. Another cautionary tale. An okay film but see Sullivans Travels if you want Sturges best witty political and social commentary on the goings-on in the Great Depression 1930s in this country.",1459814400,,4318,4.677631578947368
