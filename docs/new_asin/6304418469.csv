It revolves around a young man whose father was killed, and while being beaten up by gangsters responsible for his fathers death he gets saved by two Shaolin monks. The monks take him to learn kung fu from the abbott,but the abbott sends him away and tells him he is too scrawny and weak to learn. The monks who befriended him then take him to a Shaolin gym and con the teacher into taking him on. The teacher just has him do chores though,and won't teach him. So the young man ends up learning some kung fu from a drunkard and the drunkards pupil. The young man goes back and challenges the teacher for permission to leave,but loses against the teacher. He escapes anyway and goes and beats up several of the gangsters. He then faces the local boss of the gangsters who bests him. He goes back and learns kung fu from his shaolin friends and then defeats the local gangster boss. However, he then gets challenged by the brother of the local gangster boss. He loses and has to go back and learn a few tricks from the teacher of the Shaolin Kung Fu gym. He again defeats his opponent, and gets challenged once again by the master of the two brothers he defeated. So, he goes into training with the teacher of the Shaolin Gym and with the Drunkard and the Drunkards pupil and uses what he knows to fight the evil master. The movie in my opinion holds up on its own and most of the movie is very humorous.",1033516800,2,1542,4.266211604095563
