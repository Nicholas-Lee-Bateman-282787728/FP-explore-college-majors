The questions that are asked of the artist while he's working are nothing more than idle conversation. This lame audio is over-dubbed into the visual and doesn't even begin to match up. The camera moves all over the place in a very unprofessional manner with terrible lighting. I only got one thing out of the whole DVD and that was the use of Unbleached Titanium White to tint back a blank canvas. There is really nothing on this DVD that has any true instructive value over the YouTube videos this artist has posted. Sorry, I don't usually rip up a product - especially for an artist (he is a talented artist, in my opinion, but due to the lack of instructive content and low production quality, that has little to do with how I value this DVD). But really, please don't waste your money. He is probably a good instructor in person, but the creators of this DVD did not do his knowledge and talent justice.",1449014400,,1014,4.37037037037037
8151365,5,B000JJS5JA,"I thought it was a great instructional video!  Make sure to watch the ""with commentary"" version.  If you are tired of the same-old-same-old art instructional videos (the ""happy clouds"" tutorials and other amateurs) then Bronzini brings a fresh approach to the role of art instructor.  Visually I wasn't bored at all since the camera work kept you close to the details (that many other ""instructional"" videos forget) and didn't drag on in real-time the entire time, allowing you to watch the instructor create.  I highly recommend it to both new and veteran artists.",1414281600,,565,5.043010752688172
8151366,5,B000JJS5JA,"This is the BEST art instructional DVD I have ever seen.  The artist is a complete pro and is a wonderful painter and teacher.  The DVD has three sections all of which are very important you watch. The section without the commentary is in and of itself a seperate visual lesson, where one can just sit back and enjoy watching the master.  You have to listen to the section that says ""With Commentary"" to recieve verbal instruction in the way of a discourse between artist and students, this is a highly informative disscusion.  Then in section three under ""Tools"" you have the the artist talking about the brushes and colors he used. In all this DVD is the best out there on the market.  Marco Bronzini is in the true sense of the word a real Professional and wonderful teacher.",1179187200,4,778,4.5285714285714285
8151367,1,B000JJS5JA,"This is undoubtedly the worst art instructional video I have ever seen.  There is no dialogue to explain what is going on, the hand-held camera work is extremely jittery, there is nothing except quick views of a fast-moving brush slapping paint on a canvas.  I didn't expect or want elementary instruction, as I have been painting several years, but there was no instruction at any level.  What a disappointment.",1175212800,4,412,4.942028985507246
