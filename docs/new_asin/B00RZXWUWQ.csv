This is one where I was sorely self deluding. It is about seven friends who decide to commemorate the one year anniversary of a friends death  Brendan  by going to the middle of nowhere in Connemara and making a video for the dead guys family. A card would have been a better idea lads.

They hire a bloke called Stefan to film them; I mean seriously anyone can hold a camcorder cant they? But no not this pro as the film constantly breaks and fuzzes and then cuts out and becomes ultra annoying. For the first 31 minutes we get scene setting which is basically the lads acting immature whilst the camera malfunctions.

When we move on to the actual action, the bits you want to see are nearly all done off camera! There is some good acting  which was surprising to be honest and the make up was good. However, the complete void of originality, character development, script and anything actually happening made for this to be utterly unwatchable. Oh and they make the most 'stoopid' decisions  repeatedly too. The director of this barfathon is credited as SPK. So you are so embarrassed about this god-awful tripe you would not even put your name to it? I am just guessing but this is my contender for the most pointless piece of film making ever  this was more annoying than a three year old constantly asking why? But that is the only question that this could possibly engender  why indeed.",1466812800,,1535,4.437722419928826

Blare Witch Project was the first to do it in that filming style, but that should have been the last.  The artwork on the DVD looks cool.",1430611200,3,270,3.8214285714285716
