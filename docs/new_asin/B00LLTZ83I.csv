6490523,4,B00LLTZ83I,"After a rocky start that seemed to involve too many rapes and needless supporting characters, FXs controversial Tyrant  from the producers of Showtimes Homeland  settled in to become one of last summers more satisfying series. Following the American-educated son (Adam Rayner) of a Middle Eastern dictator who passes away, leaving the country in the hands of his unpredictable, impulsive brother (Ashraf Barhom), Tyrant takes viewers into a fictional country seemingly forever on the verge of an insurgent coup.

Seen through the prism of Rayners Barry Al-Fayeed, Tyrant generated a degree of negative press when some objected to the casting of the British Rayner in the lead role, and likewise drew jeers for its omni-present sexual situations in its opening episodes. Subplots involving Barrys American family also feel shoehorned into the series, coming off as contrived and unnecessary, though the producers wisely scaled their appearances back as the show found its footing. If you stick with it, Tyrant proves to be an absorbing mix of Middle Eastern soap opera and political thriller, and Barhoms scenery-chewing performance as Barrys hot-tempered sibling, Jamal, is thoroughly entertaining to watch.

Fox's multi-disc DVD includes a featurette and deleted scenes, along with a 16:9 transfer and 5.1 sound. Season 2 is scheduled to run on FX this summer.",1425427200,5,1361,5.40566037735849

6490530,5,B00LLTZ83I,"DRAMA IN THE RULING FAMILY OF FICTIONAL ABBUDIN -- REVIEW INCLUDES BRIEF GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT AND A WORD ABOUT PROFESSIONAL CRITICS

This taut and intelligent political thriller, set in a fictitious Middle Eastern country, is an engrossing work of television writing.  It's not just a political thriller, but has that spy element, family loyalty (and rivalry) with a hint of Godfather movies past, Middle Eastern exoticism, glamorous eastern lifestyle for the wealthy, struggle for a voice among the poor, and a lot of cultural/architectural eye candy in the sets depicting a royal life style in the ruling elite.  It's reasonably authentic for a fictional show and quite authentic in feel.

THE PLOT:  Bassam Al Fayeed is the youngest son of the tyrant ruler in fictitious Abbudin, Middle East.  His father was famous in particular for brutally putting down a local uprising to maintain his political dynasty.  Bassam fled the country and his father's legacy while very young, becoming a pediatrician in America and raising a very middle class American family.  After 20 years of exile, Bassam returns to see his parents and brother, bringing his own family in tow.  His American family is stunned by the true extent of bassam's royalty in his own country.  Some are intoxicated by it, others are more cautious.  None of them understand the full scope of the danger and power that are at stake.  Bassam's quick trip turns into an extended stay when his father passes away.  His unstable and brutal brother Jamal is the heir, but Bassam quickly finds his brother needs support and advice to avoid catastrophe as the lower classes assert themselves in an Arab Spring type movement.  Bassam believes in democracy and tries to guide his brother in the direction of free elections and transition to new government.  However, a powerful general and Jamal's capable wife are of a completely different mind.  They feel the country has to have strong rule.  The CIA has a presence and interest in how things play out as well.  Though the twists and turns are somewhat transparent when they develop, the show is not supposed to take you too much by surprise.  It's more about the process and the character metamorphosis.  Many members of the family will play different rolls.  As time goes on, we see who has the real talent for tyranny and who doesn't have the stomach.

A LITTLE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT:  The show is filmed in Isreal (I don't think they could ever film it in an Arab state) and has a palpable feel of the Levant Middle East.  There is a little bit of Persian Gulf state feel too.  The producers intentionally took aspects of many middle eastern countries and regimes so as not to be too literal.  That aside, you can see some obvious parallels.  Bassam is a pediatrician with a strong arm brother.  Syria's Assad brothers have similarities, though the roles are switched.  Bashar is an ophthalmologist who replaced his father somewhat surprisingly while his strong arm brother supported him through security in a way.  The political climate is a hybrid with some gulf states so it allows more freedom of movement in the show for characters that are American.

CRITICS:  Reaction from the viewing public has been extremely positive among those who managed to find the show.  The professional critics were a little more mixed because they felt evil was too simply and obviously portrayed.  They also felt that  Adam Ryner was not edgy or hard enough.  My take is this:  They have to allow the plot to develop over more than just one season.  I thought Ryner was about as perfect as it gets for the role.  He is exactly that family type man guided by an altruistic heart and desire for good.  He is also completely that competent brother who sees the needful things to be done.  The show really is brilliant and atmospheric!

If you are looking strictly for action and intrigue all the way through, this may not be it.  It is ultimately a family conflict set against all the other elements I mentioned.  If you are interested in all these things, I am fairly certain you are going to love this show!",1416528000,23,4103,4.8166189111747855

6490538,3,B00LLTZ83I,"Brutal stuff. It reminds me of how the people of a country run by a tyrant might in fact act, and their actions are brutal. The tyrant is brutal and needs to dominate every thing and everybody. The people are brutal because they must endure the brutal tyrant, it's a never ending trend. So I imagine the way the people are portrayed in this bit of TV is probably correct and that makes it all the more disturbing. acts of depravity abound . The people are violent and mistreated and tyrant is violent and pampered. Is this how 3rd world countries in north Africa actually behave? I think some has to be derived from real life. Take the beheadings carried out by fanatics in the Middle-East. Who would have even thought of hacking someone's head off while videoing the atrocity. So does the society act the way they do because they are ruled by a tyrant or does the tyrant act the way he does because that's how the Al-Faheed family has ruled for generations? Any way you look at it, compared to America, all these dictatorships are great places to be from. I can understand why people try to enter America any way they can to get away from atrocities inflicted on them in their homelands. I don't know where the writers get their subject matter from but I suspect some one has actually experienced a tyrants rule and relates their story to the people making this series.
The series has great production value and good solid action. I gave it a 3 because of the violence a depravity shown on a regular basis.",1476662400,,1507,4.483636363636363

Why this got past the first season is BEYOND me.  Pretty well done story lines, but with his awful ""lackluster acting"", he makes the show
laughable.  The rest of the character development was great, but I don't know why at the end of season 1 ""they just didn't fly him back

Basically, I got absolutely nothing done the remainder of the weekend because I binge watched season one and two.  I can't believe that people aren't talking about this show non-stop in the same way Dexter and Breaking Bad became huge hits.  This show is unique, well written and acted.  The scenery is beautiful and the story is intriguing.  And I could spend all day getting lost in Bassam's eyes!  I recently saw that FX renewed this show for season three and, thank God, because I would've died if I couldn't get another season of this show when it ended so masterfully after season two.

6490601,5,B00LLTZ83I,"I bought this DVD up out of sheer curiosity and I am so glad.  This is a unique family drama about the 2 sons of a middle eastern dictator and their wives and children.  You have the younger brother Bassam who ran away to America in his teens, changed his name to Barry, changed his accent and refused to return, horrified over the actions of his dictator father.  He became a doctor and married an American, and had two kids.  Then there is the older brother Jamal, heir apparent who stayed behind to be a good son to a bad man.  20 years later they are brought back together in their homeland right before everything changes when their father dies and Jamal takes his place.  What follows is a great story that is truly original.

Barry tries desperately to convince his brother to be a different leader than their father and to work to bring their homeland into the 21st century, while Jamal stubbornly holds on to the old ways, fearful of losing his power by making their homeland a democracy and allowing people the right to vote for their leader.  The relationship between the brothers is one of the best parts of the show.  They are 2 very different men, but the love between them is obvious.  Even the moments when Barry discovers some terrible secret, or is himself forced to do something terrible, you can see the conflict in him between his own moral compass, and the love he has for his brother.  He feels it is his duty to try and guide his brother away from the choices their father made, and the older remnants of their fathers regime who still believe that violence is the only way even in this age of constant media coverage.  Jamal on the other hand seems almost desperate to make his brother stay, and in his fear of losing him again reluctantly gives into his demands for reform.  On the one hand he wants to be the man that his brother wants him to be, but a lifetime of living under his brutal father has made him into a man whose first instinct is violence.  By midway in the season things come to a tipping point and the result was shocking to say the least.

The supporting characters on the show are also great especially the wives.  Jamal's wife Leila and Barry's wife Molly could not be more different.  While Leila is always whispering in her husband's ear and trying to manipulate him, Molly is the quiet supporter of her husband, standing behind and letting him know her opinions, but not forcing him to see things her way.

There truly is nothing else to compare this show to.  I am very pleased with my purchase and have already begun the 2nd season.  If you are looking for something fresh and original to watch this summer this is the show for you.",1435276800,8,2683,4.436734693877551

Very well put together and it gives some idea (maybe not to everyone's satisfaction because you cant please everybody) of the struggle in the middle east. We live in a time where people are punished for honesty; this includes writers. I cant wait for Season 2.,1428451200,,290,4.82
6490609,5,B00LLTZ83I,I love this show. There is so much conflict and passion. I randomly saw the pilot episode when it was on TV but was unable to watch the rest of the season. When I saw this pop up I had to buy it. I was not disappointed at all. I can't wait for season 2.,1427241600,2,253,3.618181818181818

8666486,2,B00LLTZ83I,"Feels like a soap opera with every scene built around forced intrigue and simple American expressions and plot lines. No wit or humor to be found; no thought required. You feel the sets, but not the setting. You hear the words, but not belief in them. Tyrant does accomplish one thing though: it leaves you as out of touch with reality as their fictional royal family.",1529539200,,368,4.590909090909091
8666487,4,B00LLTZ83I,The characters were well cast. I especially liked the American family reacting to the differences in tradition and culture. Glad there was closed captioning as dialogue was sometimes difficult to understand.,1527033600,,207,5.709677419354839

8666492,2,B00LLTZ83I,"Hi, just plain stupid and the plot lines are unbelievable. After all the glowing reviews I expected more. Evil brother that has sexual problems, takes advice from his saintly brother; who has a secret gay son. Sound like a soap opera.",1505520000,,234,4.7317073170731705
