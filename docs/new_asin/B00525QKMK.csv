Ellegant in style, great music and beautiful photography.
ALL the pieces fit in this great movie. Highly recommended.",1316995200,3,205,5.4375
4526933,2,B00525QKMK,"This unoriginal Spanish film is just another tale of defenseless women being stalked, bullied and tortured by a psychopathic mama's boy. It has some edge of the seat moments, but the storyline is so overdone and the ending is stupidly grim. Boo!",1315612800,7,245,4.857142857142857

4526936,4,B00525QKMK,"Excellent thriller from director  Guillem Morales. Just enough jumps, twists and turns to keep you guessing. The dark atmosphere gives you a sense that there is always something in the periphery that you just can't quite see, which is unnerving.  Beln Rueda is radiant and tragic but also intelligent and passionate. I would have given the movie five stars if it had not been for what felt like a rather rushed ending.",1464825600,2,418,4.791666666666667

4526938,4,B00525QKMK,Great suspense and a sense of Hitchcock storytelling.  That is until the end.  The last min is the worst bit of lame drivel hokey funk.  Still worth 4 stars but boy did that final image take it off into a Hallmark laalaa land.,1454025600,,226,4.209302325581396
4526939,1,B00525QKMK,Movie drags and drags on.  Nothing thrilling about it.  I hung in there and it got to a place where something ridiculous and incredibly annoying happened and I gave up on the movie.  Love a good thriller but this wasn't it; not even close.,1451433600,,239,4.386363636363637

4526946,3,B00525QKMK,"I thought it was overacted. This picture of a perpetually hysteraical female figure just does not grab me.  It is not totally bad, but has way too many implausible twists to hold my attention for long. I was happy when it ended because it did come to feel like a chore. I came here after seeing Belen Rueda in The Orphanage so it could eb a case of elevated expectations.",1430956800,2,371,4.3

4526949,5,B00525QKMK,"This is a bit slow in the beginning. And it's not Hollywood movie. True, it seems to be stalled in the forever dark settings, with shadows everywhere and odd camera angles. Belen Rueda is such a fine mature actress. She was in The Orphanage. I got more and more drawn into it as periodically there are well done suspenseful scenes that were really well done. Did I say that? Then comes the guy that everyone thinks is her imagination. Oh yeah! One creepy guy and he did his part very well. But most thanks to the camera man and the director. Very very good. Maybe as a movie it only deserves 4 stars, but the acting and camera work push it to five. Worth it!",1424563200,2,658,4.272
4526950,5,B00525QKMK,"Such a good movie, as to be expected from Guillermo Del Toro. He is the master of scaring you without all the gore from most scary/horror movies. This movie is absolutely frightening, perfect for when you want a jump out of your skin movie.",1423526400,,240,4.4772727272727275

4526953,5,B00525QKMK,"This is a Thriller, don't let the subtitles prevent you from enjoying this flick. I love how they filmed it as if your looking through the Main characters eyes. It leaves you scared and frustrated because you want to see so badly. No Spoilers here watch this movie.

4526956,5,B00525QKMK,"This mystery/horror/slasher-thriller is very original and scary as hell, and it comes from the guy who brought you movies like Pan's Labyrinth (2006),The Devil's Backbone (2001), and Hellboy (2004-2006).

The thing I like about this film it is that it reminds me of the 1970's and 1980's Italian giallo slashers by the famous Italian movie directors like: Dario Argento, Luciano Ecroli, Mario Bava, Umberto Lenzi or Sergio Martino.  The movie has everything that true fan of the genre will appreciate: mysterious and creepy atmosphere, spooky music, a lot of never-twisting moments, and the superb acting.  Of course, there are some predictable moments, and it is strange that the characters have typical Jewish/Russian names since the action of the movie takes place in Spain and the movie is of Spanish production.

The movie is basically about a woman who is losing her eyesight, as she steadily goes blind she desperately tries to solve the mysterious death of her twin sister (she is found hanging in the basement of her house).",1407369600,2,1033,5.094674556213017
4526957,4,B00525QKMK,"Not as good as The Orphanage, but still rather good. Has some really creepy parts and beautiful imagery. The film loses its magic about 3/4ths into the movie though. I don't regret buying this movie, but I don't know if it is for everyone. If you can, rent it/watch it online first before purchasing.",1400630400,,300,4.574074074074074
4526958,2,B00525QKMK,"this is one of those films where i wasn't quite willing to give up on it before it was over, because i kept hoping it would redeem itself. but when it was over, i wished i could get my money back.

it's a horror mystery tale in the style of brian de palma. which means, just when you think you have it figured out and know what will happen next, ha ha on you. it also means, women are victims of abuse, torture, and anguished death. and it also means, minor characters suddenly erupt into fatal significance, wield their distorting influence on the chain of events, then conveniently just disappear. a sister. an inspector. a waiter. a handyman. a husband. a parking garage attendant. a dumpy neighbor. a dead husband. a blind neighbor. a surgeon. a post op male nurse. a dumpy neighbor's daughter. a killer. a blind neighbor who isn't blind after all. onward they march, into view, out of view, twisting the plot this way and that ... meanwhile the heroine -- tall, blonde, busty, shallow, irrational, hysterical -- tramps around in high heels, bad hair and provocative decolletage, having hissy fits and panic attacks. boredom sets in and we wish that she too would march out of view. please! but no luck. she's in for the long haul. she's in all the way to the end. and the end is something to do with eyes, the universe, a cosmic view, but given what has happened up to then, it makes no sense. it's just another of those twists, they come and they go, that add up to nothing. except, you know ... ha ha on you.",1390867200,3,1515,4.43010752688172
4526959,2,B00525QKMK,"[SPOILERS] The construction of the story, the main character's connection to her sight, the universe, love for her husband, the universe etc etc., is poetic and well thought out. Even villain's motivation makes perfect sense. Cinematography, Hitchcockian tricks with the camera and all technicals were amazing; so damn, this was supposed to be good. It looked good, sounded good, started off great but in the end, the villain could have been anyone. Once the husband was out of the way we get introduced to a brand new character at which point, could have been anyone. Why not make it the inspector, or the waiter or, or, or... sure that may have been the point making us wonder who among all these. But the time spent throwing us off only to drop in the guy we never saw only heard of... well yeah, of course it's him! It made the entire first half of the movie nothing more than a giant red herring party. Then, once we know who the bad guy is we're taken through a tiresome third act where dots are connected in a dot to dot cartoonish manner. Not only is the killer the doctor but the doctor is the long lost son of the first victim who also happens to have been pretending to be blind all this time {DUN DUN DUUUUN} until she dies. It's just silly.",1384646400,5,1253,4.428571428571429
4526960,4,B00525QKMK,"Movie has been described well by others.  I love finding obscure movies that fulfill my passion for suspense.  This is a very good ""find"" .it is well acted, well written and features not only suspense, but in parts is downright scary.  I don't think you will have any regrets!",1374796800,2,276,4.591836734693878
4526961,5,B00525QKMK,"This is literally the first foreign film I have ever watched and it did not disappoint. Despite needing the subtitles to understand most of the movie, it still made me emotional. The combination of horror, violence and drama really tied the whole movie together. Belen Rueda is pretty phenomenal and I really liked her chemistry with Lluis Homar.

I'd say there were a few times during the movie where I didn't quite know what was going on but those were few and far between and I mean lots of movies have a few tiny plot holes so no major love lost there. I'm actually really glad this movie wasn't all horror and gore. In the 2 hours this movie was on, I really felt for the main character and how desperate she was. Like I said, the main actress Belen Rueda is so fantastic.

Simply put, I highly recommend this movie.",1372032000,3,821,4.430463576158941

8453575,4,B00525QKMK,"Nice Spanish language thriller (with English subtitles) where a going blind twin, is concerned something has happened to her sister who hasn't seen her for a while (not just because she's blind too) so gets in a car with her husband and travels to her small town.  We know what happened to the sister and that there is something to be suspicious about for the alive sister who believes there is an invisible boyfriend that no one else has noticed (not helped by the fact most people in her sister's life are also blind) that has answers to what happened. But the police, her husband and everyone else think she's being paranoid and that she should just go home.  She's not going to though, and creepy suspect after creepy suspect will be encountered.  But are any of these her sister's invisible boyfriend?  The added hurdle of her own vision just about going too, and the need for an urgent eye transplant during the time of her unofficial inquiries adds to the burden, as well as enhances her paranoia.  Is it even all just her paranoia?

I found the first half of the movie to be pretty slow, it did have some hot naked blind chick scenes but it was a bit too slow for my liking.  But the second post Julia's own eye operation half of the film really picked up the pace, and it became a brilliant what is really happening thriller. Sort of has the what would I do if I was in her situation vibe to it too. Although granted the last minute or so of the film was a bit of a letdown and felt rushed and like they couldn't come up with anything else.",1487635200,,1549,4.339100346020762
