friendship with a widower who is working on a yacht he has purchased, and decides this guy would be a great
father figure for him.  Reluctant to get involved at first, eventually he agrees to meet the boy's mother.  What
ensues is totally unpredictable and not what you might expect.  The climax is very satisfying, but unusual.  Overall,
the film is well acted, and the last 15 minutes, in my opinion, are 5 star, but overall, it rates a 4.",1353715200,,553,4.330097087378641
