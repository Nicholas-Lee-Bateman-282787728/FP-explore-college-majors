7622361,1,B01B6V2D0G,The quality of this DVD is poor with having 240 minutes on a single DVD9. I would recommend Acorn's Blu-ray release of the exact same.,1468454400,6,134,4.4
8749424,5,B01B6V2D0G,"It was lovely to see so much of these countries (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) from an aerial view, with just enough commentary on particular places to make it interesting. I'm from England originally, so may well be biased about how beautiful the countryside, small towns, impressive castles and ruins are, there.  And it's so easy to see it all from the comfortable position of a helicopter's flight without leaving one's sofa!  Very nice for anyone who knows these places, or are considering travelling there.  This could be the introduction you need!",1524873600,,562,5.086956521739131

8749430,1,B01B6V2D0G,"I wish I could recommend this DVD but I cannot. This DVD is a reissue of the original 4 hour long episodes from the Vision series on one disc. The extra content (the original discs had an extra hour of footage for each country) is missing. Chapterization of the episodes are also  missing. The video quality is poor. It appears very grainy with obvious video artifacting. If the original DVD  issue of this series is still available (via Acorn I think), that would be the better choice. The splendor of seeing these countries from the air is missing from this compressed DVD.",1479340800,8,575,4.627450980392157
8749431,5,B01B6V2D0G,Beautiful photography. An excellent overview of each country.,1476835200,,61,6.75
8749432,3,B01B6V2D0G,"It's an okay video. It gets a bit repetitious over time to see the same angle of view. Far too much time was spent looking at boats from above. There were many spectacular places in each of the countries that were not shown, maybe because of licensing fees to include them. I wouldn't buy this if I had seen it first and knew how incomplete it is.",1476144000,4,347,4.1940298507462686
8749433,5,B01B6V2D0G,I love this. It reminded me of all the areas that I went to in London and more that I want to go see. The scenery is absolutely beautiful.,1475884800,,138,3.793103448275862
