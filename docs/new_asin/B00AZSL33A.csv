8559884,3,B00AZSL33A,"Very strange film but overall it's okay. The twist was interesting but a bit deflated due to not enough time spent on the explanation of the twist and the point of it all. It's basically a footnote at the very end of the film. Too many secondary characters are introduced and wasted with nearly 0 development. Susen Ermich makes this film worth watching. Some of the retorts she gives are awesome the way they were written and the way she delivers the lines especially the scene when Susen is asked if ""There's a plan B if acting doesn't work out for her."" Another actress I'd like to see more of in serious feature length films that's better than Ultimate Justice.

Reading one review that complained about the sex and nudity in the film I expected a lot of raunchy scenes that are totally NSFW. I almost laughed as the end credits rolled thinking about the complaint because only a person with delicate sensibilities would complain about the nudity and sex in Masks. It's so tame and so not that serious it's ridiculous to even mark a complaint. In other words, it's a non issue. The nudity was brief, tastefully done and worked well in the context of the story told and the circumstances of the scenes presented. The sex scenes are tame to the point of being forgettable. 3*. Masks is not a bad film. Good lead in Susen Ermich, Magdalena Ritter had some interesting moments (like the gut punch scene, ouch) but the story took too long to reveal its twist arriving so late in the film that there isn't time left to actually explore it. Almost two hours for a reveal is a bit much for a film that doesn't have a lot of development beyond the lead.",1525996800,,1648,4.493333333333333
8559885,3,B00AZSL33A,It was okay. Interesting premise. Heavily influenced by Suspiria but in a good way. A little too much pointless nudity and use of sex for shock value in some quick scenes for my tastes.,1524873600,,185,4.470588235294118
8559886,3,B00AZSL33A,I really enjoyed this,1493251200,,21,4.5
8559887,5,B00AZSL33A,"Great film all the way around. If you like foreign films,German in particular,then this one is for you. It delivers the goods.",1482710400,2,126,4.7727272727272725
8559888,4,B00AZSL33A,"Incredible well made homage to the films of Argento, this one is pretty incredible.  A bit slow in  spots, but be patient and it does pay off.  Great soundtrack as well.  Not sure what the budget was, but I'd like to know.  I dig it very much.",1480118400,2,243,4.085106382978723
8559889,4,B00AZSL33A,"Good movie, definitely worth giving a watch. Also, the film is in German with Optional English Subtitles and there is No English Dub. The special features on this Set are a almost a Half Hour long, which includes Behind the Scenes which shows some of the cast and crew going through the sets and setting up and how they filmed certain scenes and watch some of the cast and crew goof off. There are 3 deleted scenes, which personally, in my opinion, don't add anything to the overall story of the film, and there are two trailers, a Music video and a quick slideshow. As another added bonus, the set comes with a booklet with an interview with the director, about himself and making of this movie, and it comes with a soundtrack CD and a Collector's Card",1477785600,8,753,4.463768115942029
8559890,5,B00AZSL33A,"I really enjoyed watching MASKS, although it is said to be inspired by the look of Italian giallo, the film is much more extreme than most giallos and really catches you off-guard often. If I would describe it it would be a European arthouse horror and quite original in its own way. Kudos to Reel Gore for the packaging, comes with awesome soundtrack CD, booklet and a collector's card, seems to be a label to follow.",1477267200,4,418,4.5131578947368425
8559891,3,B00AZSL33A,"Stylistically adept but slow German language Dario Argento homage about a young women who joins a strange acting school (as opposed to the weird dancing schools from Susperia and Phenomenon).  A girl she sees fleeing the school the day she arrives is brutally murdered (like in Susperia but with significantly less flair).  This school specializes in an acting method created by Matteusz Gdula that looks more like primal therapy, which was a fad in the early 1970's, than like something that could actually train someone to act.

If you liked the giallo homages of Hlne Cattet and Bruno Forzani (Amer; The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears) then it's very possible you will enjoy Masks as well.  Writer/director Andreas Marschall gets a lot of the stylistic elements right--Masks sometimes feels like a low-budget Susperia or Tenebrae with it's use of roaming camera, eye-popping colors and hypnotic music--but there's no real suspense or narrative momentum.  Masks feels like an empty act of imitation with none of the obsessive weirdness or inspiration of the Dario Argento movies it is borrowing elements and images from--but the surface similarities to Argento's greatest hits might be enough to provide an undemanding good time--it's the film version of the tribute band that kind of sounds close if you're in a bar and have had enough to drink.  Even with its flaws Masks is certainly more interesting and ambitious than the found-footage, Paranormal Activity style crap that passes for horror these days but that still isn't quite enough to actually make it a good film.",1437264000,8,1579,5.10077519379845
