8313108,4,B001HADE32,"This production was filmed live in 2007 at the Teatro Donizetti of Bergamo.  The singing of Silvia Dalla Benetta as Adina and Alex Esposito as Dulcamara lifts the show from mediocre to a higher plane.  This production has its problems, but I love this opera and I am easy to please and enjoyed it.

A very pretty Silvia Dalla Benetta has a beautiful voice and seemed to sing effortlessly.  I  thought her acting was not as well honed as her voice, but I think maybe there was just a lack of rapport among the players or poor direction.  I will watch for her in the future.  She is star material.

Damiano Salerno as Belcore seemed a buffoon who kept doing deep knee bends--strange comic expression--while singing.  Among the cast, I'd rate him fourth place for talent. His soldiers literally melted into the chorus; you have to search for them onstage.

Raul Hernandez's tenor as Nemorino was not at the level one usually hears in this role.  He is a competent singer but not yet (or on this occasion) on par with Benetta or Esposito.  I found his appearance distracting as he reminded me of an Italianate Donny Osmond.  And at the end, I thought he deserved more of an applause than the house gave him.

Alex Esposito sang Dulcamara perfectly.  His makeup--clown-like--limited his facial expression but he made up for it in postures and dance moves accompanied by a band of carnival types.  This little medicine troupe was pure, entertaining schtick in an otherwise static show.

For all its little faults, this is still a wonderful Donizetti opera.  The music is unadulterated.  See it!",1238371200,3,1588,4.7299270072992705
