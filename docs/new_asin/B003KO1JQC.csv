8398854,4,B003KO1JQC,"This video is not focused on technique, but then again neither was Jim Hall.  It gives some insight into he way Jim Hall thought about aspects of musical creativity.

His famous quote about developing one's own style, which he repeats in this video:""I think it's probably more important to look at a painting than to listen to somebody play a bebop solo.""  That is emblematic of the content of this video.",1444089600,,405,4.676056338028169
8398855,1,B003KO1JQC,"As a fan of Jim Hall, I had high expectations of this DVD.  Sadly, it's nothing more than a seemingly aimless conversation between Jim and a student with poor command of the English language.  Bored me to death.  If you're interested in a real master class on jazz guitar, get Vic Juris' ""All That Jazz"" video.  It's everything this one is not.",1396915200,2,344,4.5
