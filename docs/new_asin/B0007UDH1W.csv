The idea is to drum up some yuletide cheer and make you feel good about your fellow man. The plot is very complext and full of more twists and turns t han you would expect from a film that is a little more than an hour long. The Abe Lincoln in the title comes from the fact that that main guy wants to be just like Abe Lincoln when he grows up. I don't want to spoil the rest of the plot for you, but if you have seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" you have a pretty good idea where this is going.",1147910400,,637,3.9076923076923076
