2958261,5,B000VXPQRI,"I'm surprised this show doesn't have more reviews. It is by far one of my favorites. Not just a favorite of Korean shows, but any TV show I've ever watched. The story was excellent and well developed. I never felt like the story was lagging or things were being drawn out too much. It isn't like most of the Korean shows out there. This show does have romance, but it isn't the main focus of the story. Rather the main focus is on a man seeking revenge for his mother's murder.

I bought this show on a whim at my local Borders. After reading the description I thought it sounded like it would be good. If not, I figured I could sit through for nothing else than to watch Lee Jun Ki. I ended up finishing the entire show over one weekend because I simply couldn't stop watching it. When one episode ended I kept going because I wanted so badly to know what would happen next.

One of the nice things about this show is that it isn't as predictable as a lot of shows. Several things happened that I didn't expect.

I highly recommend this show. There's lots of action as well as some romance thrown in.",1248220800,25,1101,4.258373205741627
2958262,5,B000VXPQRI,"Time Between Wolf and Dog was a little bit slow in the first episode, but don't let this mislead you. Later on I understood the necessity of the time spent in the beginning. The series is action-packed for those who are not completely into the romance Korean drama. It has a lot of twists and turns, some goes along with the traditional cliche category, but never boring. I enjoyed watching it a lot, especially since it had a great cast. Lee Jun-Ki just grows on you as the series progresses. The title was fittingly given, as I often had hesitations in deciding whether someone is the loyal dog or the vicious wolf while watching the series.",1210723200,,643,4.551724137931035
2958263,3,B000VXPQRI,"Lee-jun-ki continues to grow as an actor, creating the more moving and entertaining aspects of a pretty formulaic k-tv crime melodrama. The obligatory love triangle distracts from the action, and Lee-jun-ki is no Thai boxer, but he is convincing as a troubled young man who as a child, personally watched his prosecutor mother be shot to death , only to later encounter the assasin while on duty as a drug enforcer agent. If the series could have stuck to the theme of what this person has to do to accommodate his complex feelings , especially when he becomes amnesic and  believes he really is a gangster (Kay), it could have been more powerful. Acting by the rest of the cast varies from bland to powerful. Choi Jae Sung as the drug lord Mao reminded me of Brando in the Godfather. The English subtitles on the DVD I brought have a problem from episode 12 on, becoming bewildering and comical, with all the Korean names turned to Chinese names. Over all a C, with LJK's acting a B+",1207353600,2,984,4.559322033898305

If you like the actor Lee Joon-Ki in ""MY GIRL"", you won't regret watching/keeping this 5 star action/brotherhood/love story movie ""TIME BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF""!",1195516800,,252,4.8604651162790695

I really enjoyed this drama.  The series moves between Thailand and Korea and drug trafficking. It follows lifes ups and downs of Lee JunKi's character from childhood in Thailand to adulthood as a cop/gangster in Korea.  A must watch.",1346716800,,433,4.904109589041096
2958287,5,B000VXPQRI,"Just finished my ninth K-Drama.  And I thought CITY HUNTER was intense.  TIME BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF is not for the faint of heart.  Action and emotion from beginning to end.  Sixteen hours of twists and turns that will leave you feeling like you've been smacked around from the inside out.  I don't know how the good people of the Republic of Korea manage to make their shows so addictive, but personally I like their TV a whole lot better than ours.  Highly recommended for teens and adults looking for a thriller with a heart and soul.

As with CITY HUNTER, one of the things I liked best about TIME BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF was the chemistry between the lead guy and the lead girl.  What makes this one a little different is that the guy and girl meet as children before finding each other again later in life.  I love that twist, which incidentally shows up in several of my favorite TV shows and films, including LORNA DOONE and BRAVEHEART.

There will be times when you will want to strangle almost all of the main characters, but stick with it.  The payoff is well worth it.  Considering how much emotional turmoil the characters are forced to endure, how high the stakes are, and how hopeless everything seems at certain points, I kept thinking, ""There is NO WAY this is going to end well.""  As I was watching the last few episodes, I was afraid the ending would be so tragic that I'd want to throw away my DVD set when I had finished it.

It's still sitting proudly on my shelf.  And it's going to stay there for a while.",1342310400,5,1525,4.377224199288256

back to the drama.

i have seen all his dramas + movies, and this one is the best yet.

I watch a lot of Korean dramas which I find more entertaining than what's coming out on US TV! I was so excited to find it on Amazon that I bought it without seeing the rest. I am so excited to own it and its now one of first of many in the future purchases of not only Lee Jun Ki but other dramas in the future! This is a keeper!! I can't stop watching! When I am bored, I watch it! I've loaded it into iTunes format so I can watch when I travel. So much better than City Hunter!!",1323216000,3,572,3.8559322033898304
2958292,5,B000VXPQRI,"To be honest, the reason I wanted to see this show was because of Lee Jun Ki. He personifies hotness and great acting! I had seen him in ""The King and the Clown"" and felt compelled to watch everything he was in. Not only does he BRING IT in this drama, but the drama itself doesn't have a predictability factor that I've found in some other dramas. I was glued to my seat during every episode, and all of the actors really made me either hate or love them! There's love, action, and beautiful scenery, just to name a few things I loved about this drama!",1279843200,11,553,4.226415094339623
2958293,5,B000VXPQRI,"For the best audio and video quality with the original broadcast English subtitles, look for 'Studio: YA Entertainment' under Product Details. YA Entertainment (YAE) is the licensed US distributor for Time Between Dog and Wolf. YAE works from the original master recordings and hires professinal translators for their DVD releases. Each episode runs about 60 minutes. This set contains the entire series.

YAE's subtitles are justifiably considered some of the best in the business.  Although the translators and technicians change from project to project, the quality remains consistent.  Consider the following excerpt from the program.  Two men are talking about the most important thing in their lives---loyalty:

'Guys like us, that almost died together, we don't need trust.  We got each other.'

The original Korean dialogue is wonderful.  The scene does the emotions at play justice.  YAE's subtitles capture the rhythms and pathos of the scene.  A more literal translation ('Men who have experienced almost dying together don't need things like trust.  Because they are one.') would fail completely.  As always, YAE offers viewers the finest in Korean television, subtitled by a team of technicians and translators that know their business.

This series is a wise guy spy thriller of the first order. The script is tight and fast paced, the acting superb, and the photography is most excellent. Actor Lee Joon Ki's (Le Grand Chef, Sweet Spy) portrayal of the conflicted NIS (National Intelligence Service) agent Suhyun/Kay, a spy who finds himself accepted as a son by his gangland Triad boss is one to be remembered. This show is well populated with a host of very memorable and well developed characters. On location filming in Thailand and Korea adds considerably to the gritty underworld reality of the film.

The bad guy is multi-dimensional and interesting; the two male leads playing brothers are among Korea's best actors and give two of their finest performances--especially Lee Joon Gi, who is always wonderful and is amazing here in a complex and demanding role. This series truly is a great one.

Unfortunately, for some reason, the series is currently only on GoodDrama.com which cuts up episodes and shows commercials--no way to watch films, IMO.
