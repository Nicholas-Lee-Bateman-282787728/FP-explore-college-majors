2750036,5,B000MV8AB8,"I liked the movie pretty much.  It got a little ham-handed at moments, but in general it was about as tight as the original short story on which it was based:  Man and Boy (in the April, 1971, issue of Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine).

A couple of characters were introduced that weren't in the original, but they did the job of increasing the tension and justifying the full length movie.

I must admit to being a little bit biased.  You see, I wrote the story and then during the years the film sat waiting to be finished and released, it appears my name was lost.  Given that not just the story, but essentially the substance of the dialogue ""created"" by the screenwriters (who did get credit) was my own, I feel a certain degree of neglect.  Nonetheless, I do appreciate the rendering of the movie.  Now, when will there be an American version?",1189036800,5,847,4.490196078431373
2750037,5,B000MV8AB8,"To all you Quentin Tarantino fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE. First off let me start by saying this is not a horror movie, it is however very extreme and violent. This is a film Mario Bava made in 1973 that never surfaced due to legal issues, and is an absolute shame. This is more like a crime/action/thriller movie, and VERY different for Bava. While I wouldn't say Tarantino ripped it off, I would say however that he drew A LOT of inspiration from it, especially for Reservoir Dogs.
The story is about four gangsters and a heist that goes wrong, have a run in with the cops, and take some hostages. All I could think when I watched this movie was RESERVOIR DOGS, the style of it is very (for lack of a better word) Tarantino-like. The acting was pretty impressive and stars George Eastman from Anthropopagus, if your a fan.
The most exciting parts for me were the beginning and the ending, I won't go into much detail here, but will say there are a couple of twists throughout the movie. I won't say which kind of twists though, you just have to watch it and find out.",1185494400,,1073,4.37
2750038,5,B000MV8AB8,"I'll admit that I've never seen films by Mario Bava. I've only recently gotten into Italian Cinema with the films of Dario Argento and other Giallo taken up my interest. Until now I had never tried any Bava. So hearing of this film and being intrigued with the premise I picked up the DVD.
The premise of the film is four criminals rob a pharmaceutical companies payroll during which the getaway driver is killed. The three remaining killers flee to a parking lot taking hostages, one of which they kill in order to escape. Afterwards in order not to be spotted by police in a familiar car they pull off and take more hostages this time a middle aged man and a sick child. At this point the films been a violent crime film. When it gets in the car the film is basically centered on the drive of the criminals and their hostages. Whats good in the film despite minor flaws is that even in its form (neither Rabid Dogs or the re-edited Kidnapped was completed with Bava's support due to circumstances which earned its ""lost"" status until recently) its a really well assembled suspense thriller building its tension slowly. As tensions in the car rise and victims plead for their lives even the criminals begin to turn against each other. One wants to rape the woman hostage, while another goes along with what ever happens while the leader is more concerned with just getting to their destination. There are moments in the film that to me were great in a transgressive way that newer films couldn't even come close to topping. And in the end, I don't want to ruin it but if you get into the plot as much I did it will definitely suprise you. I was totally blown away by the film. One thing also is the feeling of anger that seeps from every frame. This is a brutal film to watch at times with its portrayl of a world that is vain arrogant and rather brutal in considering the plight of the hostages (especially the child). To me its a film that in tone could almost compare to one of my favorites, Kurosawa's Ran.
Unfortunately I've only viewed the Rabid Dogs cut on the new Anchor Bay disc. It also contains Lamberto Bava's edit Kidnapped more in line with his fathers intentions which I will watch in the future but was turned off for the synthesizer score (I just love the harpsichord and organs blaring in Rabid Dogs even though admittedly the score is incesant) and didn't want to watch the film so soon after seeing it. Still this a definite recommend from me, worth viewing.",1177804800,6,2479,4.486725663716814

2750040,4,B000MV8AB8,"Q: Why do you need ""Kidnapped"" when you have ""Rabid Dogs""?
A: You don't.

If someone was to suggest that a Rembrandt painting
be touched up here and there, that individual would
be vilified.
I guess film art has been compromised
by an opinion that it is only mindless entertainment
and therefore subject to mutilation.
nb: I like mindless entertainment :-)

If Mario Bava is the great genius of cinema that he is nearly
universally claimed to be, and he is, why alter his work?
Both movies are on this DVD, so you don't need to decide
which one you want before making a decision to get a copy.
That is as it should be in the world of DVD's and Anchor Bay
does it right, as usual.

*** contains spoilers***
""Rabid Dogs"" is a great and relentless action movie,
from start to finish.
Very cynical.
One of the ancestors of ""Reservoir Dogs"" of more recent fame.
If you want happy endings and answers to the meaning of life,
look elsewhere.
""The Last House On The Left"" (original)
is a philosophical meditation compared to ""Rabid Dogs"".

The cover insert states that ""Rabid Dogs"" has been given
a newly created opening credits sequence.
It is great, but what was the original one?
This movie fan wants to see it.
The music for ""Rabid Dogs"" is amazing. Just right.
Tense, edgy rock music with distorted ""fuzz"" guitar
that starts at the opening credits and underlies the movie's action.
""Kidnapped"" uses generic atmospheric symphonic music
appropriate for a ladies tea party. WTF?!

Bunch of bad guys rob a payroll and try to get away
with the aid of a hostage or two or three
to enjoy their new status as men of means.
Things don't go exactly as planned.

If you like cynical exploitation grindhouse style cinema,
then you will like this movie.
Made by a master film-maker of the caliber that rarely
make films of this type.
If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, you will like this movie.
If you are one of those people or think that you might be,
check it out.
If you are a Mario Bava fan, check it out,
you will not be disappointed.",1395100800,4,2028,4.482384823848238
2750041,5,B000MV8AB8,"""Kidnapped"" is Lamberto Bava's re-titled completion of his famous father's 1974 film ""Rabid Dogs"" which is such a departure for Mario Bava, if the famed director had lived longer, I think this film would have brought him even more recognition.  Lamberto had already coaxed the director out of early retirement and the result was Mario Bava winning an award for his screenplay for the 1977 final film ""Shock,"" but I think the more aptly re-titled ""Kidnapped"" definitely threw me off with its unexpected brilliance.  I really do not want to give any spoilers here by talking about the plot, but it is stunning, well acted, and I don't think Lamberto had to do very much to it to finish the effort, which credit should lavished on his father, who began so many trends in the horror film business by creating the blueprints for the first giallo (""Blood and Black Lace"") and the first slasher movie (""A Bay of Blood"") and was always on the edge of increasing his genius.  Kino's Blu-ray remastered edition is excellent, however, the only extras are other Bava trailers.  Color.",1393113600,,1072,4.809782608695652

2750043,5,B000MV8AB8,"Four men rob a pharmaceutical company of its payroll. Armed and dangerous, they get the cash, killing anyone who tries to stop them. One of their number is shot dead during their escape. Hunted by the police, the three desperados must get to their hide-out, so they carjack a family -a man, woman, and a young boy- and force the man to drive them. Sadly, the boy was on his way to the hospital for emergency surgery! Now, the criminals take their hostages into the middle of nowhere. Adding tension and terror to the ordeal, is the fact that of the three kidnappers, one is semi-rational while the other two are depraved and unpredictable. Bava utilizes these thugs to ratchet up the suspense. We feel for the victims, knowing they are at the mercy of human monsters. The one good thing about eeevil psychopaths is their tendency to self-destruct! KIDNAPPED (RABID DOGS) illustrates this fact quite well. The finale is a twisted classic!...",1389052800,,940,4.773006134969325
2750044,5,B000MV8AB8,"First of all, Kino's recent run of Bava on blu ray has been a dream come true for me.  I resisted watching this until I got this blu ray -- and I'm glad I did.  Apparently there are two different versions of this film, as once again Bava had just about finished the movie when they pulled out the rug from under him.  This blu ray version has flawless picture and sound, and the story will take hold of you from the start and never let go.  If this had been released at the time it was made, it would have been considered a classic, but now that it is out, it is still lingering in obscurity.  A fine film, and the final film with Bava firmly in the director's chair.  Kudos to Kino for this quality release.  (Now please somebody release Blood and Black Lace, Kill Baby Kill, and Planet of the Vampires on blu ray!).",1383350400,4,817,4.165605095541402
2750045,4,B000MV8AB8,"Note; this US Anchor Bay DVD has two alternate cuts, one finished by
Bava's son, called 'Kidnapped'. But almost all Bava fans and
professional critics prefer the rougher edged, less polished original

--vague possible mild spoilers ahead --

It's a film that is saved by the rare truly successful twist ending,
that changes everything you thought you saw. The acting is less than
great, and the film has a definite misogynistic tone (although everyone
in it is pretty awful on the humanity scale).

On the other hand, there's effectively high tension, as 3 murderous
robbers take two innocent people and a baby hostage. Especially
impressive that it never gets talky or visually dull, despite taking
place almost entirely inside a car.

But the over-acting and clunky dubbing (and writing) really hurt. Then

2750047,3,B000MV8AB8,"Some films are just born unlucky. Mario Bava's 'lost' 1974 film Rabid Dogs is a classic case in point. Shooting started as A Man and a Boy with Al Lettieri and an extremely low budget: Lettieri dropped out after a week due to 'illness' and the money barely materialised only for the film to never get through post-production when the producer died and the film was seized by creditors for a quarter of a century. When co-star Lea Lander pulled together a deal to get Bava's rough cut restored, the only US deal she could get with it was with producer Alfred Leone, who, in a throwback to the old days when no foreign film could be allowed on US shores untouched, promptly re-edited, rescored and redubbed the film with new dialogue and added stock footage and new scenes shot by the director's son Lamberto Bava 'to complete it the way my old friend wanted it to be seen.' Sure... An attempt to make a more contemporary shocker in a more naturalistic setting as the European horror genre was hitting the skids, it plays a bit like an automotive addition to the Last House On the Left genre as the surviving members of a payroll robbery kidnap a female hostage and, later, a driver rushing his unconscious son to hospital to help them in their getaway. Cue much humiliation, boorish behavior, relentless nihilism and fatal divisions coming to the fore as you wait for the tables to be turned Tall-T style by the 'little man' (Riccardo Cucciolla, literally miniscule whenever seen standing next to the towering George Eastman). That it doesn't always do so in the most obvious ways and offers a remarkably passive hero is all to the good and Bava's confident handling never makes the fact that most of the film takes place in a car seem uncinematic - harder than you might think.

Not that Bava Sr's cut is a lost masterpiece. Like most of his films, it isn't as shocking as his reputation implies: the violence is never especially convincing even if the film's mean spirit seems genuine enough. But the re-edited version, retitled Kidnapped, certainly makes it look like one. The new footage makes the final twist, already fairly heavily signposted if your suspicions are roused early even more obvious - and a lot less bleak than in Bava's version. And while the image and sound are clearer, the constant irrelevant cutaways to police control rooms or new characters presumably intended to open up the picture simply act as irritants that dilute the drama and waste screen time without adding anything to the show. Even the new title sequence looks like something from a cheap 80s porno video.

Anchor Bay's Region 1 NTSC DVD includes both versions of the film, with audio commentary by Tim Lucas, featurette End of the Road - Making Rabid Dogs and Kidnapped, and trailers for Bava films Black Sunday, Black Sabbath, The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Kill, Baby...

8172689,3,B000MV8AB8,"Bava is one of Italy's best suspense and horror directors, but other than the rabid gangsters, this flick is a bit disappointing. The O'Henry style  ending was unnecessary and not at all satisfying",1466640000,,197,4.96969696969697
8172690,4,B000MV8AB8,"Almost all the action takes place on the road, in the getaway car. While the desperate robbers and killers are a constant threat to the woman, the driver and the sick child with him, it does get tedious at times. But it still manages to stay intense. When they have to stop for gas, when their hostages try to escape, when the hostages see someone they know--those scenes help break the monotony, and introduce new suspense. Then, at the very end, Bava throws us a twist, which I won't reveal, but which I thought was very clever. Not as gory as later movies, but I could see someone like Tarantino doing a remake of something like this. I am sure he would relish the role of Blade. The police, of course, are incredibly inept. It does seem funny to see gangsters driving around in little Fiats, instead of the high-powered steel monsters typical of US films, but crooks do their best with what's available, obviously.",1462147200,,918,4.569696969696969
