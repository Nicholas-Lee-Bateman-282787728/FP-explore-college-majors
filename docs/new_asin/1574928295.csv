195658,4,1574928295,so bizarre.  and fun.,1487462400,,21,4.25
195659,3,1574928295,"I've waited years for this to come out on DVD. I'm delighted that it has, but, sadly, the sound is not synced with the film. There's about a 2 second difference. Watchable, but not good. I hope they figure it out.",1483228800,2,213,4.219512195121951

195662,3,1574928295,"Love Maxine. The cassette  was crushed on one side but the tape was still intake on the reel so my husband just removed the tape reels and placed them in another cassette, played just fine.. Cost more for shipping then it did for the item. May want to box the cassette next time you ship.",1389398400,,288,4.236363636363636
195663,1,1574928295,"I was very disappointed in this movie. very short too. Would not recommend it, to anyone,  just wasting your money.",1385164800,,115,4.75
195664,5,1574928295,"Actually, I find this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" immensely entertaining, and it has added a lot of merriment to my recent Christmases.  I regret that I didn't discover this version when it was first released, and I've never even been a fan of Maxine!",1381622400,,254,4.644444444444445
195665,3,1574928295,"This is an audio version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" with visual aids - the visual aids being the pages of the book, which fill the screen, as if to create the impression that the viewer is sitting on the narrator's lap, reading along as the narrator reads the book out loud.  Ideal as an educational tool - not much fun as a ""movie""!",1231891200,25,330,4.238095238095238
7798762,5,1574928295,great Movie great condition.,1518393600,,28,6.25
7798763,3,1574928295,"As a geek for Cold War culture, I am very glad to have seen this film, but I did not realize until I began to screen it how cheaply this DVD was produced, by a company that transfers home movies to digital.  The audio and video are out of sync.",1517961600,,244,3.88
7798764,3,1574928295,Not the cartoon animated version I had thought it was. It's more like a book in dvd form.,1517875200,,89,4.0
7798765,1,1574928295,Master is bad sound de-synchronizes more and more as program goes on. Have seen two copies both  have identical problem.,1516838400,,120,5.0
7798766,2,1574928295,"I got this for my husband, who loves Rod Serling, and also loves the Christmas Carol.  It seemed like the perfect gift.  And it would be.  Except the audio and the video don't match up.  So, if you're doing something else, and just listen to the dialog, it's great.  But if you want to see what's happening at the same time, it's really frustrating.",1511568000,,349,4.390625
7798767,1,1574928295,"The delivery was on time and looked okay, but when I started to play the disc, a problem occurred.  It was a DVD-R and the video started to get out of synch with the audio.  It got worse as time went on so that it was annoying to watch.  So unless the maker an correct this, I would not buy the DVDs",1511481600,,299,3.7903225806451615
7798768,1,1574928295,Unfortunately this seems to be the only DVD release of this Christmas special. The sound is off from the video - delayed by about 5 seconds. I deem it unwatchable.,1509753600,,163,4.466666666666667
7798769,5,1574928295,"Rod Serling's contribution to television script writing remains priceless. His creative abilities  inspired many future writers. In 'A Carol for Another Christmas', he continued to explore and better understand the human condition, it's frailties and strengths.",1508889600,,261,6.25
7798770,2,1574928295,"The sound doesnt match the film speed, so its hard to watch but I still love the dvd and I use it as Xmas background noise",1508457600,,122,3.730769230769231
7798771,2,1574928295,"Disappointed with recording quality. Starts out well enough but halfway through the first dream sequence, the audio jumps out of sync with the actors talking and remains out of sync for the rest of the movie. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was one of Serling's writing masterpieces and gives a historical glimpse into what the country was feeling about wars and the consequences of war. I should have read other comments from buyers and I may have passed on this.",1506556800,,483,4.627906976744186
