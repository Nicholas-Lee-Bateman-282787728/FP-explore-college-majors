8365281,4,B002DHSGYA,"Well this documentary i rate good,has a silent menu but a nice enticing ending.
Credits shown while narrator is still talking for the end,before the enticement.
Repeated footage a lot but excellent picture quality and sound.
Interesting and informative hearing about what the experts and scholars believe and have seen,and there are a lot of them in this dvd.
Good costumes and props,especially the ships,this might be boring to some.
Did this place exist,if so where is it?
For the answer to this turn to this dvd,i think you'd be pleasantly surprised,i know i was.
I like the way they put this thing together very well thought out.",1343433600,2,633,4.87037037037037
