2361836,4,B000A50442,"Unlimited hydroplane boat racing may not be the most exciting sport in the world, unless you're from Madison, Indiana, where the sport was born - then it's everything. The town even owns its own boat, the Miss Madison. But she's on her last leg and has become the laughing stock of the racing circuit, much to the unhappiness of ten-year-old Mike McCormick - played by Jake Lloyd - who is just now getting to travel with the team. As the racing commission prepares to kick Madison off the circuit so a more lucrative team can join, the luck of the draw gives Madison the opportunity to save face and their place on the circuit by hosting the 1971 Gold Cup Championship. But it means coming up with the $50,000 prize money, getting their boat in shape, and finding a new driver. Can they do it?

It looks pretty hopeless to Mike, whose dad, Jim McCormick - played by Jim Caviezel (I Am David, Count of Monte Cristo, Passion of the Christ) - used to be a driver. But he was injured in an accident in which his best friend died and, since then, has contented himself with just being a part of the team. Now, as the town prepares for the Gold Cup, the driver they thought they had lined up is killed in another race. Jim sees no other way but for him to climb back into the cockpit, much to the chagrin of his wife - played by Mary McCormack - and everyone else's better judgment. Will he follow the same fate as his friend and the previous driver?

There are a lot of similarities between Madison and other small-town-Indiana sports films - like Hoosers and Breaking Away. (Paul Dooley played the father in that film, and plays the mayor in this one.) William Bindley directed and co-wrote Madison with his brother, Scott, and the result is a family film with a strong message about hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness and high production values. Jim Caviezel gives his usual solid performance, as does most of the cast. There are memorable highlights, like the team stealing a World War II engine out of an antique plane on display in front of a nearby town's courthouse; a man-to-man talk disguised as a fishing trip between Mike and an old family friend - played wonderfully against type by Bruce Dern; and a great reenactment of ABC's Wide World of Sports covering the Gold Cup race. The boat racing is well filmed with a certain amount of excitement, especially in the flashback sequence.

But there is something missing. Even though the stakes are high for both Madison and Jim McCormick, when it's time for the big race, I'm not on the edge of my seat. Whatever is not working has to do with the script, and that one element keeps it from being a five-star film for me. It may just be too tame; or maybe boat racing is hard for non-adherents to get excited about; or perhaps the threat of death (the real antagonist) doesn't seem great enough. Much like another Jim Caviezel sports film project, Stroke of Genius, there is nothing outstanding here. However, it is good, old-fashioned storytelling with strong production values - and that's worth a lot.

2361837,5,B000A50442,"I first heard about the movie, ""Madison,"" on the Madison, Indiana website, ""[...],"" and then I saw the movie in a theatre down the street from my daughter's home in Burbank, California. This movie was made for Madisonians like me, I love movies and I love Madison, Indiana. I grew up there. I attended the Madison High School Class of 1958, 40th Reunion during Labor Day weekend in 1998. The reunion happened to coincide with the Regatta weekend. It was nice to know there was still a Madison Regatta and to hear the thunder boats roar up and down the river. I amazed that everyone I spoke with in Madison seemed so knowledgeable about hydroplane racing. They are not hicks. The harshest critics of the movie live in Madison, Indiana. Madison, Indiana has been the setting for two films in my lifetime, ""Some Came Running (1958)"", and, ""Madison (2000)"". That's pretty good for a nowhere town. The old town photographs pretty well. Madison is a good family film about hydroplane racing.  The Bindley brothers did a fine job. I bought the DVD and will recommend it to my friends and associates.",1127001600,11,1092,4.717277486910994
2361838,4,B000A50442,"I saw this film the same day as I saw Sin City- talk about whiplash! Both films are good in thier own ways, and both delight in the cliches of thier respective catagories (underdog sports movie and hard core noir).

Madison was made with alot of love, and it shows, it is a very pretty movie to look at and the final race climax is very well done. All in all it is a pleasent way to spend a couple of hours",1126742400,6,406,3.951219512195122
2361839,5,B000A50442,When I first saw this movie it brought back the memories of years ago. I remembered those summer days when we would hear the sound of the piston powered boats on the Ohio River and couldn't wait to get down to the riverfront. It's a great movie for those who enjoy hydroplane racing and a small town atmosphere.,1126051200,14,311,4.379310344827586
2361840,5,B000A50442,"As one who spent many a summer weekend in the town of Madison during the seventies, it's as if this movie were custom made for folks like us, so objectivity is somewhat out the window.

Nonetheless, one need not be a Hoosier to enjoy this movie, based on a true story about a small town team with no budget, professional talent, inventory or modern technology taking on the likes of ""Budweiser"" and ""Atlas Van Lines"" and succeeding beyond imagination.

This film won a standing ovation at the Cannes film festival.  How often do you see a standing ovation for a film?

John Mellencamp's narration also adds a nice Hoosier touch.

For those who would quibble that the facts aren't 100% straight, the boats are not the correct vintage, etc. it is well to remember that this is a movie based on a true story, whereas the Wide World of Sports account is the better documentary.",1125878400,20,873,4.606451612903226
2361841,1,B000A50442,"we couldn't wait to see this movie! we waIted for 8 tears for it to come out. WHEN IT FINALLY DID WE PUT ALL OUR MONEY (AND OTHER PEOPLES) INTO IT. WE HAD A BIG PREMERE ETC. WE PUT ALL OUR MONEY INTO IT, THINKING THAT IT WOULD BRING TOURISM TO MADISON. THEN IT CAME OUT AND LAYED THERE LIKE A DEAD FISH IN THE POLUTED OHIO RIVER. NOW WE ARE BROKE. THIS MOVIE HAS VERY LITTLE TRUTH TO IT. IT RIDES ON THE  HEELS OF A LITTLE GO NOWHERE TOWN THAT IS STILL NOWHERE! THE STORY LINE IS AS  POOR AS THE WRITING. THE TOWNS PEOPLE LOOK LIKE STUPID HICKS. BUT YOU SHOULD COME AND SEE IT, AND THEN VISIT MADISON, SO L LYTLE CAN RECOUPE OUR MONEY.  BOTTOM LINE, BORRING PLOT, BAD ACTING,  SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH IT IS FUNNY. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY.",1125014400,3,735,3.979591836734694
2361842,4,B000A50442,"Overall, it was a very good movie. If you're an ""old"" diehard like me, you will quickly notice that most of the boats used were incorrect (boats that were actually pickle forks, boats long retired before this Gold Cup, etc.) I'm sure there is no big stockpile of vintage boats, and they did the best with what they had, especially the crash scenes using RC hydros. It was somewhat historically accurate probably due to problems portraying the actual drivers, sponsors, etc. However, it was an inspiring movie similar to ""Rocky"" and is well worth seeing. It was great to hear the old pistons again and brought back great memories. We saw it at the theatres, but I don't believe you will lose much on a home system.",1124236800,15,713,4.622047244094488

But Jim will have none of that and his crew sticks it out and keeps rebuilding the engine. Patience and money will try this team.

It has all the trappings of an underdog small-town down on its luck movie--some characters are so nauseatingly cliche it defies explanation.  But this movie has a lot of heart and it's based on a true story.  The best part of the movie for me was at the end when the ABC Wide World of Sports footage rolls during credits and you get to see the actual people reacting to Kieth Jackson almost exactly as they had portrayed in the film.  That's great stuff.  The DVD is anamorphic 16x9 and the cinematography is top notch!  Nothing we haven't seen before but it's honest and heartfelt.  Disc arrived as expected and in good shape.,1358294400,,789,4.546099290780142

2362204,3,B000A50442,"Growing up in Detroit during the 50's and 60's with unlimited hydroplane racing in my blood, I found the movie Madison to be a relatively accurate portrail of the ""golden age"" of this dying sport. No longer can you actually see the drivers struggling to control these monsterous racing machines and the sound their turbine motors make now doesn't live up to their reputation as ""thunder boats"". It was great to see the beautiful restorations of these wonderful craft running in anger during the movie. That being said however, the plotline of Madison doesn't seem to me would be very interesting to anyone unfamiliar with the sport of unlimited hydroplane racing, which may explain why the movie didn't do very well at the box office.",1250726400,4,734,4.88
2362205,3,B000A50442,"I bought it because the raceboats used in filming were boats refurbished by the Hydroplane and Raceboat Museum, then located in Seattle, now moved to Kent, WA. I like to watch these old boats run, even though they are not really risking the equipment like they would be if they were really racing. The story has interest from the viewpoint of a young boy whose father is the inspiration for a town to sponsor a raceboat. I was not impressed with the way the story is told, but again, I love to see the old boats run. Other than for the old boats, the story is probably targeting young boys age 6 to 13 years old.",1244592000,2,612,4.2844827586206895
2362206,4,B000A50442,"This turned out to be a ""sleeper,"" a good film that few people have heard of, I suspect, outside of Madison, Indiana. Being in an area that used to host hydroplane races, it intrigued me. I also usually enjoy movies that star Jim Caviezel.

Mainly, this was a nice film with a feel-good David vs. Goliath story based on a real-life occurrence back in 1971. It involves the sport of hydroplane racing, meaning extremely fast boats raced in different bodies of water around the USA. A town nearby where I live used to have these, but I haven't heard of them in decades.

Anyway, this story takes place in a small Indiana town that was on the skids by 1970 but plants closing all the time and people moving elsewhere. The hopes of its boat, ""Miss Madison"" also seem to be about lost until, as fate would have it, the town is awarded the opportunity to host the ""Gold Cup,"" the biggest event of the sport.

A string of failures, followed by new disasters, include the death of the pilot, near-death of another one and the boat being just about totaled in the process. How the town - led by former racer ""Jim McCormick"" (Caviezel) - can raise the money to resurrect the town, the boat and the driver himself, are all shown here. McCormick not only has to pull off several miracles but also try to win the support of his wife and son, who have had their fill of disappointments with this sport.

The film winds up being a sports movie and a drama about a family, a team of workers and an entire small town trying to pull together and beat tremendous odds. I have to use two clichs here: it's a heartwarming story and, yes, it's a good family movie. You don't have to worry about offensive material. It reminds me, in spots, of a made-for-TV movie. It kind of plays old-fashioned corny but in a way that makes you glad you watched it.",1237161600,2,1827,4.396449704142012
2362207,4,B000A50442,"I got an inexpensive copy of this movie yesterday, and took it home and watched it.  Yes, I am a fan of hydroplane history-love the sound of the piston engines.  The movie plays fast and loose with the facts of the 1971 Gold Cup, the Miss Madison, even the circumstances in Port Madison, Indiana.  Who cares? !!!  It's a great story, even if a bit contrived.  It immediately reminded me of The Natural-a great baseball story, even if contrived, and non-historical and different than Malamud's book.  When Miss Madison crosses the finish line, it's the same feeling as Roy Hobbes rounding the bases under arcing light towers.

Heck, how many good boat racing movies have there been?  Especially hydroplane racing?  Like, none.  Rent it, buy it, it's a family movie.  Your kids will love it.",1213142400,,789,4.770370370370371

Gold cup hydroplane racing dates back to 1911 and has a rich history of boats, teams and drivers. Unfortunately it's hasn't attained much popularity beyond the Indiana and Washington race sites. I am glad a film was made to  document the great gold cup race of 1971 and the underdog local Madison team. The film is very well casted and has some fantastic footage of racing on the Ohio river. I give it only 4 stars for a somewhat formulaic plot. Beyond that it's a well done, entertaining movie.",1199232000,2,697,4.3538461538461535

There is a few, but basically you see grim looking guys sitting in slightly rocking boats being sprayed with water and oil. The boats are antiques and are obviously not driven hard/fast. At least not as hard and fast if compared with shorter up-to-date video footage you can find on the internet. It is nice to see some of the old boats in action though. The plot may be based on a true story but will put any child to sleep. Even I had a real hard time watching the whole thing. And I cannot possibly justify to show it to my  boatbuilding students (age 14 and up)or the younger ones for entertainment. Because it just is not entertaining.
