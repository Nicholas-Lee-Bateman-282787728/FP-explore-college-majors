Great record of the 4 hurricanes that hit florida in 2004 within 4 weeks. As being one of the thousands affected with loosing my house this is a great DVD Historical Record of the damage made by these storms. I purchased this DVD in 2004 which the proceeds went to the disaster relief fund. I hope those who sell this thinks of all the people affected by these storms. Lets hope we do not see it happen again.",1241481600,,663,6.285714285714286
