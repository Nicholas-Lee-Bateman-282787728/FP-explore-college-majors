3985731,5,B002TQKL48,"Just when I thought season 1 was on fire, season 2 gets even hotter!  If you don't have this DVD, I suggest you not hesitate in getting a copy of this dvd.  Of course, some of the material is adult themed, so do not view while small children are around. But the show is so real you get sucked in and you find that you can't help but to watch.  You will not be disappointed, worth every penny, loved every second of this dvd.  This season will definitely end with you thirsting for more....",1264896000,,489,4.170212765957447
3985732,5,B002TQKL48,"The game was on.  Just brought it and have already viewed it five times.  Ms. Robinson is in rare form.  And the Irv Smitt character too funny.
Folk need to send comments to the producers to keep this show going.  I'm surprised at Kelsy Grammer, he had a real cash cow with this one.  Girlfriends went on too long for my taste.",1264723200,,327,4.209677419354839

I think some of the most popular scenes from this show were only enhanced because of the music they chose for a particular scene fit like a glove.",1275609600,3,294,4.0
3985844,5,B002TQKL48,"This season was even more entertaining than the 1st & made me wish that I had supported this show while it was on air!

The season kicks off with the aftermath of Melanie discovering Derwin's betrayal.  They break up, kinda makeup then break up FOR REAL.  Each begins a new relationship but are they really over each other?  Melanie struggles to reclaim her identity and stand on her own while Derwin becomes a break out star and outplays Jason to become Malik's ""go to"" receiver.  After he & Melanie split he also begins to enjoy the perks that come with being a star athlete.

Meanwhile Jason & Kelly's marriage continues to deteriorate as he takes drastic measures to keep his spot on the team while Kelly tries to establish her independence.

Malik continues to ""ball out of control"" after moving to his own home and he & momager, Tasha part ways professionally after she fails to handle a p/r nightmare.  Tasha moves on to a management firm but has a hard time dealing with the ""good ol boys"" network.  She does however make a love connection with one of her co-workers, Rick Fox (yes, THAT Rick Fox who is surprisingly good in this role).

Oh, by the way - the Sabres make the playoffs again but to those who haven't seen it yet, I won't reveal the outcome.

This season also had a fair amount of excellent cameo appearances from the likes of Chad Johnson (hysterical as himself on a very bad date with Melanie), Serena Williams, Lil Kim, Tavis Smiley, Darryl 'Chill' Mitchell and finally Robin Givens (as the one who breaks Malik's heart).

Really excellent show that is worth the purchase - my only gripe is that the price point is a little high so wait for the sale then grab a copy!",1274659200,,1692,4.511475409836065

3985847,5,B002TQKL48,"Due to various work schedules, I finally got a chance to put the entire series of The Game in its complete sequence... The 1st & 2nd seasons have been like a bag of ""chips"" You just can't eat just one., I'm still scraping the bag for crumbs, I'm ""jonesing"" for season 3,.. Tia Mowry's finesses her craft to top notch perfection, The whole ensemble takes you on a trip and makes you want to jump back in line to ride again.. The celebrities musicians, athlete, appearances were smoothly casted and easily written in, male or female... ""Music Soul Child"" even has acting chops...",1266624000,,577,4.611650485436893
