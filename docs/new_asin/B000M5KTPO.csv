8166579,4,B000M5KTPO,"People are rightly complaining that these DVDs won't play for them.  That's because they are in the European PAL format and region code of 2.  The U.S. DVDs are formatted as NTSC media with a region code of 1.  The product information for these DVDs does not show the region code to be 2, so it should be revised to tell customers that the discs probably won't play here.  I used DVDFab software to convert these discs to U.S. format and region code so that I could watch what I paid for, rather than return the package.

To get 3 movies for the price of one is a bargain.  I especially wanted the Steven Seagal film ""The Patriot"" because it is not available on Netflix, is not for sale on many websites at a reasonable price right now, and I never see it shown on TV.  Some people call this film boring because of the relatively fewer fight scenes than usual in a Steven Seagal film, but I've always liked it.  I haven't seen the other 2 films yet.",1490572800,2,949,4.262569832402234
