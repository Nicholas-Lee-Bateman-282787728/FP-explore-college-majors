8348284,2,B001ZEHRXI,junior was one of the best. so sad that his life ended 10 yrs. ago. i like watchin the video for entertainment but if you want to learn something you better pass this one up. completly useless for any level of harp player. no instructional lessons at all. just some jammin with arlen roth.,1272326400,6,289,4.37037037037037
8348285,1,B001ZEHRXI,"Clearly there is something ineffable about music, and clearly there things about music which cannot be imparted or rationally understood, but the babbling incoherent moron in this video does a truly superb job of making NOTHING understood!!  His mind may have been present at one point in his life, but it is surely gone in this video.  My advice to you if you wanna learn the blues harp is to look at a good spread of you tube videos.  Let them teach you.  But don't rely on this weirdo's ramblings to be in any way pedagogical.",1261440000,5,529,4.479166666666667
