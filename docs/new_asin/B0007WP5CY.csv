2246947,1,B0007WP5CY,This dvd has very very very little to do with the wisdom of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.  Stephen Wolinsky is marketing his own unenlightened thoughts.  This is not the real thing!  All this dvd did for me was show me where Wolinsky's practice stopped and his own ego-gratification took off into the land of spiritual materialism.  Stick to the silence Wolinsky and let the words of the genuine masters do the teaching.  Who ever gave you the permission to sell a master's name as your own?,1141516800,11,487,4.682352941176471
2246948,5,B0007WP5CY,"Pranams to narrator, Stephen Wolinsky, and director, Maurizio Benazzo, for an exquisite presentation of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and his Teachings. This DVD is a Satsang and darshan of Sri Nisargadatta on disc! Stephen Wolinsky, a quantum psychologist, and long time direct student of Maharaj, skillfully and articulately presents the basic teachings of his Teacher in both a narrative and experiential format to facilitate not only a mental,cognitive understanding, but an experiential realization of Sri Nisargaddatta's core teaching, the,'I AM'. He does so, by taking the viewer through a series of subjective experiential self enquiry exercises that facilitate a recognization of 'I AM-ness'. Central to Sri Nisargadatta's teaching on Advaita Vedanta was this primordial experience wherein all preconceived notions of oneself and one's reality are relinquished through the process of ""neti-neti"", roughly translated as ""not this, not that"" until the primordial bedrock of Existence is reached, the Supreme Reality of Self or Truth. Sri Nisargadatta himself, was instructed by by his Sadguru to ""hold on to the 'I AM'"", an instruction he obediently and devotionally carried out until his own Self Realization, three years later. Sri Nisargadatta is perhaps one of the greatest Advaita teachers of our modern Age, along with Sri Ramana Maharshi. As such his immortal Words and transmission stand out like a beacon of Light on the starless night guiding Truth seekers across the ocean of samsara to other shore, and indeed, beyond it. This DVD captures the essence of Sri Nisargadatta and his Teachings creating an enduring relationship between seeker and Teacher and ultimately transcending both. As such, this important DVD, is as appropiate for the beginner, as well as, advanced student of Advaita Vedanta and can not be recommended highly enough. This remarkable DVD also contains never before seen footage of Maharaj giving Satsang and discourse from his home in Bombay. A real treasure!

  Wolinsky, likens the immortal Words and transmission of Sri Nisargadatta to a ""virus"" that consumes and destroys everything in its way, unlike itself, until it arrives at that bedrock of Truth, the primordial nature of one's very Existence, the Self, transcending birth and death and the mind itself. This is the Power of these Teachings, and as such, can never be overstated for the very nature of Truth lies somewhere beyond the conventions of the mind, intellect and the rational. Within the province of the 'I AM', everything dissolves into the Formless and is yet not divorced from it. And so it is, this DVD, has the ability to ""infect"" the watcher with a ""virus"" emanating from the Truth of the immortal Words and Grace of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj transforming the ""watcher"" into the ""Witness"" abiding in Self. Such is the Power and Grace of a Realized Master transcending time and space. Such is the Power of Maharaj! In the end, all concepts of Guru, God and Self disslove into the One. And beyond. Om Jai Sri Ram!",1138406400,12,3021,5.211934156378601
2246949,1,B0007WP5CY,"Wolinsky is selling snake oil!  Read ""I Am That"".  It's the real deal.",1136332800,8,70,4.3076923076923075
2246950,5,B0007WP5CY,"This is a unique and all too scarce spiritual presentation on video.  Stephen Wolinsky delivers a vivid account of his remarkable experiences within the presence of a great enlightened teacher in modern times.  Nisargadatta spoke from and about The Absolute.  He did this from his own realizations and did not quote from other sources, nor was he a scholar, but an ordinary family man.  Stephen leads an excellent guided meditation early in the program and later defines many Sanskrit terms with articulation and even clarifies the statements of the Master.  One can begin to sense the state of the ineffable awareness which is that the substrate of all form and non-form is pure conciousness.  To better put this in context the viewer should have some familiarity with Advaita.  I recommend firstly to see the VHS/DVD ""Awaken to the Eternal"" featuring N. Maharaj.  Also the three books edited by Jean Dunn, one of which is ""Prior to Conciousness"".  Very well done.  Enjoy.\",1125792000,24,974,4.9937888198757765
2246951,5,B0007WP5CY,"A listener from Chicago...WOW! This is a serious and sincere piece by one of Nisargadatta Maharaj's last living disciples. I had studied I AM THAT (the book) since the early 1980's and was stuck on the I AM  and there being no doer.  This DVD explains it all. I am sure this DVD will push alot of spiritual buttons as Wolinsky uses Maharaj's words to deconstruct everything.

If you want Advaita at its clearest and most concise, this is it, and this is what I have been waiting for.",1123200000,16,483,4.404494382022472
2246952,3,B0007WP5CY,"A word of caution regarding this DVD. It is very unique and has many instructive points, but can be understood as Nihlism if one does not have background or perparation for this type of teaching. Whatever the intent of the makers of this film, it can be interpreted as being nihlistic if one does not have a understanding of this type of wisdom.

Several points -

This DVD claims to be all the teachings of Maharaj. Shouldn't it have been maybe the essence or quintessence of those teachings since the book ""I Am That"" is huge and not his only statements?

This is more like Stephen Wolinsky's understanding of Maharaj in video Cliff's Notes form.

And this is as much about Wolinsky as it is Maharaj.

They use the term ""nothingness"" quite a bit when this concept is questioned by science. Even a vacuum has things going on. Voidness, emptiness, shunyata, and spaciousness are better choices of words.

No discusion of the two truths ultimate and relative just an assumption from the ultimate perspective but they never say this. No discussion of Bodhicitta, universal lovingkindness for all apparent beings.

Materialiam reflected in the interpretation of the ""fluids coming together"" statements on the DVD. Its all just nueroscience apparently. No expansive view of Consciousness which seems to be just nuerotransmitters according to the DVD. Even Joseph Campbell recognized varying forms of consciousness such as in the plant kingdom.

No Karma - which is very dangerous for those not prepared and defies many traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jains, etc.

The coverage of Nirvana seems to be one dimensional and it ends there. Dr. Wolinsky defines it but little depth follows what could be a more elaborate discussion. Once again, possibly giving an impression of Nihlism.

The experiential exercises are very good, but I sense this DVD while useful on many levels and even profound is flawed and incomplete and could easily give the wrong impression on several fronts. Be careful. Do some good background reading on Advaita Vedanta, Sri Ramana Maharshi, and Middle Way Buddhism.",1122163200,24,2092,5.072886297376093
8052919,3,B0007WP5CY,"This man was obviously very inspirational to many, including Wolinsky who produced the video.  I found the video to be highly repetitive, and much of the footage fell short of communicating his charisma.",1354838400,2,203,5.151515151515151
8052920,5,B0007WP5CY,"This is unquestionably one of the best DVDs I have seen. The footage of Nisargatta Maharaj is unique. I think the production is excellent. On the strength of this experience I bought the other 3 DVDs that make up the collection. Top marks to the Director- I love it!

8052921,5,B0007WP5CY,"Through Steven Wolinsky's eyes you will encounter several themes about which Nisargadatta spoke. Through Wolinsky's enquiries and meditations you may be able to experience the message of the themes.

Included is footage of Nisargadatta teaching and interacting. The films of Nisargadatta himself are integrated into the film and are also included as a separate 35 minute track on the DVD.

The themes identified and explained include (quotations are Wolinsky's words)

--Advaita vedanta: ""Everything is one substance, not two.""

--Gnana: ""Anything you think you are, you're not.""

--The I Am: ""(The I Am is) your being as it is.""

-- It's all an illusion: ""More striking, the witness of the illusion is part of the illusion. The witness is an abstraction of nothing.""

--No doer: ""You may not even be aware of your own enlightenment since there is no I there to realize it. That is there is no I to get enlightened.""

--It's all a concept: ""A concept is an abstracted representation of nothing.""

--Cause and effect: ""Since there is only one substance, no specific localized thing can cause a specific localized thing. One drop in the ocean cannot choose to go someplace other than the entire ocean.""

Wolinsky quotes Nisargadatta: ""My sentences will tear apart anyone who listens to them."" Can the same be said for Wolinsky's words? That brings up another theme:

--Guru: ""Ask yourself: Can they teach? Can they teach ... me?""

Wolinsky is a teacher. You will have to determine how effective he is for you. In any case, he teaches his themes very well. I also enjoyed a separate track on the DVD in which Steven tells about the history of his spiritual life, how he encountered Nisargadatta, and what his meetings with Nisargadatta were like. You might want to view that track first.

This is the first of four videos in which Steven Wolinsky presents Nisargadatta Maharaj's teachings and elaborates certain premises set forth by Nisargadatta. These videos are not intended to replace a direct study of Nisargadatta's work. They consist of the direct teaching of Steven Wolinsky and they supplement Nisargadatta. Nisargadatta Maharaj is one of the great sages in recorded history and Wolinsky is an effective living teacher.",1219363200,2,2225,5.046448087431694
8052922,2,B0007WP5CY,"I purchased this DVD about one year ago, and I have been hesitant about giving it any kind of review at all, because each person finds certain things helpful that others do not.

I watched this DVD approximately three times, and certain parts I watched a little more than that.  Overall, I did not find this DVD to be all that valuable.  As I look back on the film, one of the only things that I am glad to have been able to see on it, was the footage of the Maharaj in his humble abode, but I don't think that most people will find that watching that short amount of footage is worth the price of this DVD, which by the way, is pretty expensive.  I payed at least $35 for this DVD.

As I read the book I AM THAT, it seems clear to me that even just one chapter of that book, is generally speaking, more valuable than the contents of this DVD.  I don't want to put the producer of the DVD down at all, and I don't want to criticize him in any way, however, I just want to help other people discern whether or not purchasing this DVD is going to be a satisfying choice for them.

One of the thing that was valuable about the DVD, was the quick two minute session, where the narrator asks the viewer to close his eyes and determine whether or not he or she is ""loving"" without using their thoughts, feelings and perceptions.  I thought that was helpful, but again, that was a very brief aspect of the DVD, and I really don't think that that is something that makes the DVD worth the price.

The most I would pay for this DVD is $10, but even if this was a $10 DVD, I don't think that it would change the fact that it was not extremely beneficial to me.  It was not a horrible DVD, but it just seems to be too expensive for what you are getting out of it.

Each person is different, so some may find that it was helpful for them.  However, generally speaking, I think you will not be extremely impressed by it.  All of the DVD seems to be comprised of the film director speaking about his experience in India with the Maharaj.

The last thing that I want to mention, is that if you type in the words ""Nisargadatta Maharaj"" on YouTube, you will see a great video that is about 8 minutes long.  I have found that video to be extremely worth while, and I continue to refer to it month after month.  That video is free to watch by the way.

Overall, I would give this DVD between 1 and 3 stars.",1217721600,7,2387,4.098924731182795
8052923,1,B0007WP5CY,"This DVD contains some very sketchy talk by Wolinsky mixed with some extremely low-quality, incomprehensible video footage.  There's nothing to be learned here. It's an absolute waste of money.  Read the wonderfful Sri Nisargadatta book instead.",1194048000,2,245,5.777777777777778
8052924,5,B0007WP5CY,"LOVE this DVD and have purchased number two, NIRVANA MEANS EXTINCTION and the third in the series, PRIOR TO THE I AM.

8052925,2,B0007WP5CY,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the book I AM THAT.

However the dvd contained very poor visuals and repeats the same material

again and again.  Actually this may be very well for study of the concepts (or non-concepts). But my final feeling was one of disappointment. The only reason I did not return it is I thought it might prove helpful to watch when unwilling to read the book. Also it can be used to explain the teachers' concepts to beginners.  However be assured this dvd will never replace the book.",1165449600,7,530,4.5473684210526315
8052926,2,B0007WP5CY,"The DVD is sold as a presentation of the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj by Stephen Wolinsky, one of his students. The eastern teacher Nisargadatta Maharaj was a strong proponent of the enlightenment teachings of the Avaita-Vedanta (Non-duality) tradition. He came to be renowned in the west after the publication of the book ""I am that"" in 1974 which became a spiritual classic.

I was very excited when I saw the various chapters of the video on the back cover as they appear show a great outline of this masters teaching. Chapters show on the back cover include:

The I AM
The Body
Consciousness
The Nothingness
Realization
Spirituality
The Guru
The Void
Birth and Death
Cause and Effect
The One Substance
The Illusion

Only a few of these topics are well covered and on the most part they do not really reflect what this video is about. Do not think for one moment that you are going to get a nice explanation or understanding of each of these topics. While the video starts off well with the first few explanations of these chapters it quickly deteriorates into something unnecessarily confusing, complicated and based in personal opinion. I believe Stephen made this DVD with the best of intentions but he is definitely NOT enlightened and therefore not qualified to teach the words of the master. He is simply a student like you or me. His interpretations are at times clear and useful but at other times his own theory.

The beauty of Nisargadatta's teachings is there simplicity, Wolinsky's explinations on the other hand can get complicated. Also at times Dr. Wolinsky's can go on ad nauseam especially when he is giving his experiential exercise. Dr. Stephen Wolinsky is often unable to explain himself clearly in one take as can plainly been seen by the numerous edits/cuts during his explanations. This DVD is actually about what Stephen Wolinsky thinks Nisargadatta taught. The product description states ""The Complete Teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj"" which is true but they forgot to add on the end ""according to Stephen Wolinsky"".

I did not listen to other reviewers when they said do not to buy this DVD. I wish I had but because I love Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj so much I just wanted see this video and the footage of him. Please don't be fooled by the product description saying you are going to get ""extraordinary video material includes a 30 minutes subtitled question and answer session with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj"". Yes, you do get 30 minutes of extraordinary video footage, extraordinarily bad quality audio with haphazard subtitles and bad translation into English. Unless you are very familiar with Nisargadatta's material then this won't mean much to you. Reading one page of I AM THAT would be far more beneficial then watching these 30 minutes. There is very little merit to this watching this video footage other than seeing Nisargadatta light up a cigar or cigarette much to my surprise! Did he know they were bad for him? I wanted to reach out and take them away from him just to see his reaction! Now that would be a good test wouldn't it?

8052927,5,B0007WP5CY,"To anyone actively integrating the teaching of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, perhaps at first the interpretations given by narrator/meditation guide Stephen H. Wolinsky in this excellent film will seem superfluous.  But repeated viewing will relax the tendency to minimalize Nisargadatta's realization in this way and allow the viewer to experience Dr. Wolinsky's intimate understanding of the core realization of the Self that is at the heart of I AM THAT I AM.  The inclusion of actual footage of Nisargadatta puttering around his modest domicile, honoring images of the Navanath Sampradya lineage and uncompromisingly correcting misguided ego-manifestations of visitors while Bombay traffic bleats through the walls and someone bangs away with hammer and nails is solid gold.",1152057600,7,774,5.721739130434782
8052928,5,B0007WP5CY,"It surprises me to see such contrasting reviews on this amazing piece.

But then...NIsargadatta has always been very difficult to accept unless your palate is open to accept new, sometimes hard to digest, morcels...

But once you get to him it's impossible not to appreciate his honesty that at times seems to be verging on rudness...

The same rudness appearing in some unnecessarily bad reviews on this page...

This DVD is fantastic, Dr Wolinsky does an amaziong job in presenting Nisargadatta teaching and what I appreciate the most is the fact that he does not put himself on a pedestal, does not claim any form of enlightnment like many other ""teachers"" and that is to me the sign of a TRUE seeker and, incidentally, one that understands Nisargadatta complex message.

Thank you Dr Wolinsky for your work!
