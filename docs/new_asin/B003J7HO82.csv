4129430,5,B003J7HO82,"I was delighted to come across Dr. Sternberg's video.  As a behavioral scientist myself who works with human behavior in the workplace - i found that her program could have huge implications for managing the stress within the work context - what if there are things that employers can do to actually make people ""heal"" - or ""thrive""?  Good health is a necessary condition for workers to perform at their jobs.  Perhaps we should focus on that first, instead of other bogus means to enhance a worker's performance.  Can we build better spaces that make the sense of ease that a worker could feel be the ""default"" setting?  I am eager to explore some of these concepts in my own living lab.",1344384000,3,688,4.60655737704918
4129431,5,B003J7HO82,If you did not know the affects of your attitude on you body's health this is worth while reading.  Attitude is everything. Dr Sternberg did a remarkable journey to prove its value in her life. It works for me.,1312156800,6,210,4.384615384615385
4129432,2,B003J7HO82,"If you're curious/intrigued by the premise of this video, I would recommend renting it over buying it.  It is a VERY superficial overview of beliefs/practices which are thought to promote overall health & healing:  Visual surroundings & environment can relieve stress. Pleasant smells can relieve stress & promote health.  Regular exercise like walking promotes health. The Mediterranean dies is healthful.  No kidding.  Everybody knows this stuff and this video doesn't really offer up any new information or novel /interesting studies.",1290643200,12,537,5.6625

8397943,5,B003J7HO82,"The photo on this documentary does not reflect the ""feel"" of this documentary. It is about a doctor who researches healing and after going through a lot of stress (losing her mother, etc) notices she is getting rheumatoid arthritis. She later takes a trip to Greece and notices her symptoms start to disappear. Was it the food she was eating? Was it the scenery? Was it the lack of stress?  More research follows. I watched this a while back and it is no longer available as a stream on Amazon or Netflix and found myself wanting to watch it again so bad I ordered the DVD. I will probably order another one for a friend of mine. Great documentary!",1417478400,,648,4.445378151260504

8397946,5,B003J7HO82,"Very solid information everyone should get a dose of. Maybe on the dull side, but it is a science documentary so I can't fault it for that.",1386460800,,139,4.185185185185185
8397947,3,B003J7HO82,I like it but it is not what I expected. It goes more into the explanation of how the mind and body heal.  Otherwise okay. Very informative.,1374192000,3,140,4.185185185185185
8397948,4,B003J7HO82,"I am a Spiritual Counselor through Religious Science and believe that what you think with conviction will show up in your life. This is a demonstration of this belief. In Science of Mind, what you put out you receive is a spiritual truth. Dr. Esther Sternberg did an excellent job through science to show this principle. The documentary is short about 56 minutes. I am including this film in our film festival at church. The film was very informative and offered through science that diseases can be reversed through the mind because this is where diseases begin.",1369440000,4,563,4.814432989690721
8397949,3,B003J7HO82,"I bought this for a friend, a young man who is dealing with serious kidney disease. He has been trained in acupuncture and observes healthy diet, etc. Although Dr. Sternberg's experience with improving her inflammatory conditions via positive environmental stimuli and good diet is inspiring, I don't think the remedy applies to my friend's very serious disease. He is probably already doing all the things Dr. S recommends, but all that will help him is a transplant. I didn't give the CD to him, as I thought is would just be suggesting that ""if you handled your disease better, you wouldn't be so sick."" And, that wouldn't make him feel any better.",1355875200,3,651,4.821428571428571
8397950,5,B003J7HO82,"This was enjoyable, and full of lots of great information.  I already knew most of it since this is an area I have studied for some time.  But, it was a nice refresher and was entertaining to watch.  I recommend it!",1348444800,2,215,4.195121951219512
