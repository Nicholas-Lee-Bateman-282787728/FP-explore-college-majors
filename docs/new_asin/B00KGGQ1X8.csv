8658398,1,B00KGGQ1X8,"The description/title says that this is season 3 of the series. The description does not include the number of episodes or any other information, other than the part where it says that there are 3 discs total. Once I received the product and saw the back, where the episodes were listed, I saw that this item is in fact 3 discs, but only contains 3 out of the 10 total episodes for season 3. $50 for 3 out of the 10 episodes is ridiculous.",1463356800,,439,4.238095238095238
