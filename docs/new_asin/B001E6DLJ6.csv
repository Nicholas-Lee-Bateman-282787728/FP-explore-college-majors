3546019,5,B001E6DLJ6,"JAKE AND THE FATMAN is an excellent show. Season 2 is actually
better than season 1. Season 1, however, is fast-paced and
action-packed. Joe Penny is an excellent co-hort, and actually
improves with age. This is a series that I passed up the
first time around. (Not quite ready to see ""Cannon"" in
another role). (Nor did I care for ""Nero Wolfe"" which took
place somewhere in between the two shows). However, it IS exciting,
and William Conrad is superb in his role. I must admit that I did
William Conrad a grave injustice by not checking out this
show. HIGHLY recommended!!!",1294099200,5,575,4.647058823529412
3546020,4,B001E6DLJ6,"This set was better than I remembered. I had liked the show when it was on air but as  younger person you can misjudge things.......glad I did not in this case. The acting was good and the story lines. Being a Columbo fan this is right up there. I did,however, like volume one of this season a little more.",1280102400,,306,4.186440677966102

3546024,4,B001E6DLJ6,"If your a fan of Joe Penney (From Riptide)then you'll love this '80's series. Joe play private investigator Jake Styles who works with L.A district attorney J.L.(Fatman)McCabe. The relationship between the two leads works on alot of different levels. There's young guy(hothead)with older guy sensebilities. More like father and son in most cases. The action is good,and in the second season the show moves to Hawaii.  But what stops me from giving this set 4 stars is the fact that Paramount split the season in half. Just like they did with Dynasty. Holding a series hostage and forcing you to buy the other half of the season is just downright greedy and mean on the studio's part. Don't they realize they would sell these series very well left intact? Especially when their competetors don't do it this way. In spite of Paramount's greed and lack of respect to their consumers,this is still a good series to have and own.",1223596800,15,924,4.811320754716981

3546030,4,B001E6DLJ6,"I loved this series.  Good story lines and great chemistry between William Conrad and Joe Penny.  I can't figure out for the life of me why it is taking so long to put out the rest of the series.  The last release I believe was in 2009.  Unfortunately, this seems to be pattern all too often.  Wait long enough, and it will be back on television where we can tape or DVR it.  Then the studios can kiss any profit from the DVDs goodby.",1467072000,,434,4.107142857142857

3546049,5,B001E6DLJ6,"I don't like many shows on TV anymore, so I've returned to the classics. I grew up watching Jake and the Fatman. There is a wonderful rhythm to this show. The chemistry between Joe Penny and William Conrad is awesome. While the stories are good, you can tell they tried not to take the show too seriously. Just take the intro, where both Conrad and Penny can't keep from laughing. It gives the show a light-hearted touch even during the most serious of cases. The producers definitely played up the fat slob persona for Conrad's character - at times a little too much - but it totally fits. There are enough twists to keep this from becoming a predictable series. I want every season on DVD!",1399075200,6,691,4.492063492063492

The story lines are pretty good especially how lame today's tv shows are.

Would rate as 2 1/2 stars.",1365638400,,315,4.322033898305085

Quality? They could have probably done better, but that doesn't take away from the joy of watching it, in my opinion. Got a great price on Amazon, too.",1360886400,,345,4.0144927536231885
3546063,4,B001E6DLJ6,"I actually got this first season in two parts. It reminds me a little of COLUMBO, since one of the producers is involved. I would rate the intro as the best of any show. I hope they release all the seasons! You can't beat the older crime shows. You see a lot of nice scenery, and at a slower pace. ENJOY!",1352073600,,304,4.0
3546064,5,B001E6DLJ6,I can remember  seeing this series when it was on TV.  While I missed a lot of episodes  then now I have had the chance to purchase  both volumes of Season one of this  series. Joe Penny is great as is William Conrad as the tough DA.,1327881600,,233,3.872340425531915
8296617,5,B001E6DLJ6,"This is another show from the 80's-90's that I wasn't able to watch. Back then VCR's were still somewhat expensive and were just starting to come down in price. I worked a lot so this is one of the shows that I did not bother to watch. I enjoyed watching William Conrad in Canon and in Nero Wolfe, so I purchased Jake and the Fatman.

At first the series started out slow with Jake just about solving the crime in the first few minutes of the episode, but then the series changed and it got more interesting. Joe Penny was clearly in his prime as an actor and the show often showed him lifting weights or exercising. The Fatman or JL was just the opposite, clearly savoring food more than anything else.

The two actors work well together. What was also nice about the show is that you get to see actors & actresses who guest starred on the show. And the women who guest starred were often knockouts. So there is something in the show for everyone.

The show has a little Diagnosis Murder in it but its to be expected since Diagnosis Murder was a spin-off of Jake and the Fatman.",1525478400,,1079,4.305418719211823
