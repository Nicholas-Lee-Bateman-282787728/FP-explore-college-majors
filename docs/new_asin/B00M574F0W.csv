8670349,5,B00M574F0W,Received DVD in great condition and before time promised.  Movie is fun to watch and a great opportunity to see an actual Olive Thomas movie.  It is nearly impossible to see an Olive Thomas movie since she died so young and most of her movies were not preserved properly from the silent era.  Very happy with purchase.,1504224000,,318,4.543859649122807
8670350,5,B00M574F0W,"Olive Thomas, a worldlywise 25, plays aspiring adventuress (and vamp) ""Ginger"" King, 16-year-old nymphet daughter of the senator from Orange Springs. Remanded to finishing school in upstate NY, seeking kicks she flees to wicked Gotham and then bests her hometown ""smarter set"" in full (Lillian Russell) vamping drag. Olive appears, luminously, in almost every scene, with radiant star power. Like the generation of (talking) screwball comediennes that followed much later, she is outrageously beautiful and scandalously funny, establishing the flapper style template for parallel silent mimers Marion Davies, Clara Bow, Mabel Normand, Pola Negri (in WOMAN OF THE WORLD) and Louise Brooks. The film dates from 1920, and Thomas (with long unbobbed hair, not yet shimmying to the Charleston) is artistically poised midway between the faux sanctity of her sister-in-law Little Mary Pickford or the sisters Gish, and those more brazen successor flapperettes Davies, Bow, Normand, Negri and Brooks. (Not by accident the chic sisters Shearer, Athole and Norma, have uncredited bit roles in support of Thomas.)

Olive's star turn is dazzling and not yet dated, and she enjoys special backing from the first-rate Selznick (Myron deputizing for father Lewis) production team: Frances Marion wrote a madcap, witty script (hence Ginger's heedless teenybopper generation repeatedly characterized as ""sap-headed and pin-feathered""), and her title cards are equally literate and artful. The daring cinematographer is John W. Brown, who photographs Thomas exquisitely in real locations, with fun snowscapes at Ithaca, NY, and in some risky traffic jams in midtown Manhattan (Thomas glows like a beacon even thronged among dozens of boulevardier extras). Thomas' director is her contemporary Alan Crosland (1894-1936), a Dartmouth graduate and actor-turned-auteur historically famous for Jolson in THE JAZZ SINGER. Crosland was younger, hungrier and more interesting in Olive's silent era, although his later sound credits at Warners also include the first Perry Mason film (CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG) and a lavishly original (Technicolor, Vitaphone) Sigmund Romberg operetta VIENNA NIGHTS. His direction is not obtrusive, but the assured framing and editing suggest an intelligent, unaffected, and young cinema showman.

Both Olive Thomas and Alan Crosland are worth rediscovering and rewatching, and this ""Gingery"" flapper is one of Thomas' few surviving films, out of some two dozen. Viewers won't be able to take their eyes away from her beauty and vivacity, and Ms. Marion's dandy script maintains the gentle, self-deprecatory comedy quotient at a continuously seductive simmer, silently anticipating the screwball vogue by some 15 years.",1501891200,4,2724,5.69041769041769
