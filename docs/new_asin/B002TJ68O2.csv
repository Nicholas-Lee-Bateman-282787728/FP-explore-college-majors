3984897,5,B002TJ68O2,"I purchased this DVD with Ellen's other new release, the Yogini Workout, which I didn't really enjoy that much. But this one is GREAT! I have all of her DVDs, and this one is great because you really work up a sweat, she focuses on a lot of different muscle groups and the flow in it is really great! I like that there's a lot of flexing for the foot, which really feels good with bare feet. All in all, an excellent workout for all fitness levels!",1265846400,3,448,4.160919540229885
3984898,5,B002TJ68O2,"I love this workout.  I never imagined I would work up such a sweat exercising barefoot.  I wanted to try something different b/c, using 8lb weights with other workout DVDs, my upper body was beginning to look bulky.  I found exactly what I was looking for with The Studio workouts.  So far I've tried this one and Skinny Sculpt.  I was so impressed with both that I just ordered Yogini and Fat Burning Fusion.  I know the won't disappoint.  Ellen is a great instructor - it doesn't even seem like you're working out!",1264896000,4,517,4.494623655913978
3984899,4,B002TJ68O2,"I love Ellen Barrett's workouts because they leave you feeling energized and de-stressed, instead of exhausted. That being said, although the Studio workouts have been great for toning my butt/glutes area, I don't get enough results from them for them to stand on their own. Instead, I find that I need to do more intense workouts most days, and save the Studio dvds for lighter days and days when I have less energy. They are a wonderful complement to my harder workouts, with so much stretching, lengthening of the muscles and focus on breathing. Barefoot Cardio, in particular, is a little light on the cardio (no panting breath or pounding heart here, just a lightly elevated heartrate and light sweat), but it does leave me feeling really good afterwards--which counts for alot on days when I need a boost!",1264118400,22,811,4.841726618705036
3984900,5,B002TJ68O2,"Ellen Barrett was an excellent instructor who was positive, knowledgeable, and down-to-earth.  She talked a lot about form and the benefits of mind-body exercise as she went through easy-to-follow movements that worked the body in a balanced way.  It is a fun program (48 minutes long) to mix in with other DVDs throughout the week to get a nice variety of exercise.  When done correctly, it is also harder than you would expect.  As a regular exerciser at an intermediate/advanced level, I still worked up a sweat and felt muscles being used that I don't use with many other DVDs.  The cardio did not get my heart pumping as vigorously as other DVDs, but I didn't expect it to; this program is a combination of cardio, toning, and stretch all in one instead of being just straight cardio.  I enjoyed the workout and found it both relaxing and energizing.  It is also easy for me to do in the small space that I have.  I recommend it.",1261872000,14,934,4.550898203592815
3984901,5,B002TJ68O2,"I've loved Ellen from Allstar Workouts on FitTV, so I thought I'd purchase a couple of her workout dvds. Barefoot Cardio and Fat Burn Fusion really do combine all elements of a great workout minus the weights. This is not a hard body workout, but elegant moves that really get your heart pumping. Ellen has an upbeat, smooth voice and she easily transitions her students from movement to movement. Very effective!",1260662400,,413,4.830985915492958
3984902,1,B002TJ68O2,"I would have given this video zero stars if that was an option. I agree that there's nothing new here, not that different from Ellen's Fat Burning Fusion. The music was so soft I could barely hear it, and the moves were boring and repetitive, not like the vareity of movement used in her other videos. For example, the ""pony"" move was way overdone. I love and highly recommend other videos from The Studio, like Slim Sculpt and Fat Burning Fusion, but I returned this one.",1259798400,50,472,4.5
3984903,5,B002TJ68O2,"Have been looking forward to getting some new Ellen Barrett DVDs and this one doesn't disappoint. There is no dread factor to doing this workout. It's challenging, and you do feel like you're working out, but it's so gentle and easy on the joints that it's a pleasure to do.  You don't feel wiped out at the end, but instead you feel energized, strengthened and lengthened.  It's nice not having to jump up and down in order to 'get a good workout'. You do this right and you're going to burn some calories for sure. It's mostly cardio, but there also are some toning moves incorporated into the workout. The 'happy feet' and 'ponies' can get a little repetitive when it's time to start them again, but once I'm actually doing the movement, I kinda get into it. And what a treat to be able to get such a good workout BAREFOOT!  When doing her DVDs consistently, I really do notice that I stand taller, look leaner and am stronger.",1258934400,7,930,4.458823529411765
3984904,1,B002TJ68O2,"I am a big ellen barrett fan. I bought all her DVDs on amazon.

On this DVD, it looks like that ellen Barrett gain weight;

She is out of breath during the movement. Compared with previous DVD, this one is not good enought. Sorry ellen barrett, I want  to be very honest.

The movement she designed is almost same as previous series. Nothing new.

I was thinking whether I should keep it or return it. Although I love ellen barrett's fitness theory, but I feel a little bit dissapointed of the barefoot cardio one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to say sorry for my previous comment on this DVD.

1 I do not know that Ellen had a baby. She did looks great in shape!
2 When I made last comment, I just saw the DVD and did  not follow the class. Watching only is different from excising.
3 Ellen did make some changes and add new things.

Currently, I already have six Ellen's DVD",1258588800,12,939,4.705521472392638
3984905,5,B002TJ68O2,"Barefoot Cardio, how hard could it be? For me, it was harder than I thought....the name made it sound easier. Barefoot - Beach =)  If Ellen isn't doing a movement that includes arms, you arms are held out parallel to floor - gravity wasn't my friend during this workout!

I highly recommend this workout!  The choreography isn't complex and being barefoot really works your balance. This is easy on the knees. Happy Feet/Pony did start to get old after a while - that's my only complaint. It had its intense moments - I consider myself intermediate-advanced/beginner-advanced level exerciser. Barefoot Cardio is great for all levels!",1256947200,79,2870,4.702
3984906,3,B002TJ68O2,this is a great workout but it can get boring and long,1423440000,,54,3.5833333333333335
3984907,3,B002TJ68O2,"I own most of Ellen Barrett's DVD's, and really like her instruction and almost all of her routines. This one? Not so much. As other reviewers have said, way too many ponies and happy feet! Just feels like a lot of ""filler"" material.",1416355200,,233,4.441860465116279
3984908,4,B002TJ68O2,"I like many things about this workout--it's suprisingly effective at getting my heart rate up, and I like the way the moves make me feel stretched out as well as worked out (like a good yoga class that way, only with cardio).  What I don't like is the music--it's like elevator music and really unmotivating.  Also, for me personally, all of the laterial and plie-type movements are hard on my knees, and I often have sore knees the next day.  I still come back to it now and then just for variety, but it's not my favorite.",1414022400,,524,4.381443298969073
3984909,1,B002TJ68O2,"Like her soft approach, but of the 3 different programs by Ellen this is the weakest. Arms, arms arms , give-em a break
  Best of 3 is Fusion. Music is soo motivational  & please stay on beat. Cueing good choreography too
  From an x Jazz & Jazzercise instructor",1402358400,2,262,4.375
3984910,3,B002TJ68O2,Ellen Barett's videos are all good and I'd buy another when I tire of what I have got. Well done.,1398556800,,97,3.9
3984911,4,B002TJ68O2,Very good video. It is easy on the joints but very effective. All your muscles get strengthened and stretched.  I enjoy working out with Ellen,1397606400,,142,4.68
3984912,5,B002TJ68O2,"If you're looking for a 45 min workout where you'll be constantly moving and keeping your heart rate up, this one is ideal.  I love Ellen Barrett's DVDs and have a bunch on them, but this one is different because it's so simple--no weights, mat, or shoes needed.  And you'll work some different muscles when barefoot.  As Ellen describes, pointing you toes or getting up on your toes are both more efficiently done when barefoot.  It also helps to focus on balance--without the support of shoes, you have to use different muscles, or use the muscles differently, for maintaining balance.  The exercises provides a great all-over workout, including arms, which are constantly in motion, too.  Another quality video from my favorite instructor!",1390608000,,742,5.040983606557377
3984913,5,B002TJ68O2,Ellen never ceases to amaze me!  She crafts a challenging workout and keeps you motivated.  Will definitely rotate this workout into my schedule.,1390521600,,145,5.260869565217392
3984914,5,B002TJ68O2,"I love this workout! I do it on days where I don't want to exercise because I feel blah and tired. This exercise leaves you invigorated and energized, not exhausted. I love that you don't have to wear sneakers. Personally, I hate sneakers and only wear them when it's required or I'm walking/running outdoors. I love the Star Arms! Ellen Barrett is a burst of fresh energy. She's motivating and encouraging without being annoying. And I LOVE how each segment of the workout transitions/flows very smoothly into the next one!",1388793600,2,524,4.833333333333333
3984915,2,B002TJ68O2,Way too much happy feet and pony! VERY repetative and boring. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND her Fat Burning Fusion video which has a greater variety of moves and better music. It's probably one of her best workout videos.,1386892800,,210,4.702702702702703
3984916,2,B002TJ68O2,It was not the same personality that I liked in Ellen Barrett. She was very low key and not as motivating.,1386115200,,106,4.095238095238095
3984917,5,B002TJ68O2,"I was looking for something to add-on to a short but intense cardio session (usually on rebounder) that would take advantage of my raised heart rate to allow me to burn calories but not totally wear me out or have high dread factor.  This dvd was perfect and it is also good for evenings (or mornings) when you want to add in some exercise and just move and not worry about having too push yourself to hard.  Also, I could see myself using this during lunch break at work to help me burn some calories while trying to loose those last 15 pounds since it elevates heart rate without getting you all sweaty.

The first time I did the dvd, I did 20 minutes on rebounder with my heart rate around 145 - 150.  I immediately popped this in and did the 45 minutes and my heart rate stayed around 120 - 130 and according to my monitor I burned an additional 400 calories.  I did the program on its own and my heart rate stayed mostly around 115 but did occasionally spike up around 125.  Without the after-burn of the more intense work-out I only burned around 250 calories which is about what I burn walking around my neighborhood at a good pace.

Ellen comes across very pleasant and has cheerful demeanor. The music is not memorable but it is not intrusive or overtly loud like in some dvds.  I like the fact that most of the raising of cardio comes from using leg muscles instead of high impact or going down to floor and standing up exercises which are used in all the dvds now. Your arms do get tired holding them out to the side and I found myself doing punches like kick-boxing to actually let them rest from just holding them.  The choreography moves enough not to be boring but stays same enough you can zone out and de-stress. Again, a nice pleasant and enjoyable routine for light day, add-on or second exercise session.",1380240000,,1824,4.372781065088757
3984918,2,B002TJ68O2,"I love Ellen, but I found this workout to be too gosh-darn monotonous. She's since come out with her Live Series (5 DVDs to date) that is far more engaging and effective.",1377734400,,170,4.34375
3984919,5,B002TJ68O2,"This was the first Ellen Barrett video that I bought, and after doing it two times, I bought four more.  That should give you an indication of how I feel about this video.  I love Ellen's videos, it seems that every move is thought out to give you maximum range of motion and the most impact on your body.  This video is a little more cardio than the rest of her videos, with segments of the ""pony"" interspersed between standing toning.  Her toning moves are a combination of ballet, pilates and basic strength moves.  I always feel after this tape that I have gotten the perfect cardio/toning workout.  I am a firm believer in working your body at a softer more moderate pace for a longer length of time.",1375142400,,705,4.426356589147287
3984920,4,B002TJ68O2,"I first bought 4 of the 5 Live workouts.  These are all great: cool music, challenging moves, an fun-loving Ellen.  By comparison I find the Studio workouts to have dull, quiet music, far less challenge, and Ellen seems more business-like.  I don't feel like she was having any fun, like she does in Power Fusion, Grace and Gusto, Sleek Sculpt Express, and Super Fast Body Blast.  Barefoot cardio is definitely my favorite of the Studio workouts: more challenge, better music, and Ellen is not as serious. I'll probably keep this one but not the Studio workouts I purchased this week.",1370304000,,584,4.81
3984921,5,B002TJ68O2,Brought to excersie and I love how it works my whole boday and also focuses on certain parts of your body. its a great workout,1369785600,,126,4.08
3984922,5,B002TJ68O2,"This is one Ellen workout that really makes me sweat.  It leaves me feeling energized and ready to go, it also really gets results when you stick with it.  I feel stronger, slimmer and happier.  Thanks again Ellen!!",1368144000,,215,4.605263157894737
3984923,5,B002TJ68O2,I enjoy working out to this CD.  It is worth owning.  Ellen Barrett is very pleasant and does not grate on the nerves after you have done in many many times!!,1367539200,,158,4.064516129032258
3984924,3,B002TJ68O2,"I have nearly all of Ellen's videos and this one was a little disapointing compared to the others.  It is still a very good workout which is why I still gave it three stars. I had seen other reviews complaining about the amount of pony and Happy feet reps and now I can see why. about half way through the video you start thinking ""OK, this is a great workout but I sure hope there are no more pony and happy feet sets"".  By the time you get to the last happy feet rep, you wonder why she called it HAPPY feet because you are so not happy about it. I began to dread finishing a set of different moves because I though happy feet and pony were coming for me again.

All that said, it is a very good workout but can make you crazy with the amount of happy feet and pony sets. I won't use this workout as often as the rest or Ellen's videos but it will be good to mix it up every once in a while. as annoying as happy feet and pony were in this video, Ellen was still very encouraging and cheerful about the workout. this is why I prefer her to most other fitness stars.  I would rather do this workout any day rather than sitting through something by Jillian Michaels and totally destroying my knees, watching her fawn over the girls that are super ripped.",1365724800,3,1254,4.106122448979592
3984925,5,B002TJ68O2,Love her instructing style. Encouraging and pleasant. Her moves are gentle and get your heart rate up. I own several of her dvds and like them all.,1364774400,,147,4.481481481481482
3984926,3,B002TJ68O2,sorry i bought it.  same ol same old moves.  really didn't like it.  glad there are others to buy. poor.,1364601600,,104,4.1
3984927,5,B002TJ68O2,I started working out to barefoot CARDIO in February and I love it!  You don't think you will sweat but 10 minutes into the work out you start to feel the burn.  I love the ballet moves since I have a history in ballet.  You get an excellent workout and you feel so energized afterward.  Burning calories have never been so enjoyable.,1363651200,,334,4.338709677419355
3984928,1,B002TJ68O2,"This is a poor quality product.  The DVD is pixelated and skips halfway into the program.  Junk!  All of the other DVDs I bought via Amazon worked fine, except this one.",1363564800,,169,4.387096774193548
3984929,3,B002TJ68O2,It was an ok workout. It is not very challenging. This would be good for a beginer or a very light day. You do sweat but not much. There is too much of the happy feet/pony move. Some of Ellen's other dvds are better. This workout does give you a little bit of a lower body workout.,1362355200,,281,3.9473684210526314
3984930,5,B002TJ68O2,"This DVD is great!  Not sure what I did before working out barefoot, but I'll never go back.  Sneakers are no longer for me.  This is a great overall workout.  Just hard enough.",1361232000,,177,4.2727272727272725
3984931,3,B002TJ68O2,"I have enjoyed Ellen Barrett's workouts for many years and this is no exception.  This is not a workout I reach for when I went an intense, heart-pounding, drenching cardio routine, but for lighter days, and especially for beg/int exercisers, this is a nice cardio option that also has good toning workout for the lower body.  Even though I exercise on a regular basis, I felt this in my glutes/thighs the next day.  Ellen's use of fusion elements like standing pilates make her genre of workouts very unique.

Production quality is decent.  The indoor studio is very pleasant and I liked the two background exercisers.  The only reason I took off two stars is because the music is very low and the movements are too repetitive.  Better/louder music and more variety in the exercises would have made this a perfect, lighter-day workout.",1360195200,,836,4.845070422535211
3984932,4,B002TJ68O2,"I have had this disc for 3 years, and I enjoy doing it.  However, a year ago (April, 23, 2011, to be exact)I did the workout barefoot as I had done many times in the previous months.  That time I did some serious damage to my feet.  Planter faciitis and/or ankle bursitis were a part of my life for the next 8 months. When I decided to do the workout again many months later, I wore good athletic shoes, and I was pleased to see it works just as well.  She natters on about full flexion and ""stretch the top of your foot,"" but I can do that with shoes on, and I won't wake up tomorrow with a podiatrist in my future. I'm not saying to pass on this workout, but those of you who have it, and those of you thinking of getting it, you really should put on some shoes.  Those months of pain and searching for solutions for it are not worth going barefoot during this good workout.",1356739200,,876,4.069767441860465
3984933,5,B002TJ68O2,"Fantastic workout, I love how you sculpt, stretch and burn fat all with one workout.  Your body feels amazing after, and you definitely know the moves are working to your body's advantage.  There are some moves I have to be careful with, due to a lower back injury, so form is key, and Ellen is very clear on proper form.  It's nice to have a workout where you stretch as you workout, as this helps with  post workout soreness.  Etc...Ellen is great, can't recommend her enough.",1356566400,,478,4.511627906976744
3984934,5,B002TJ68O2,"I like the Ellen Barrett style, and own many of her DVDs. This one is a good, moderate workout. I take it when I travel because true to the name, no equipment (including athletic shoes) is necessary. All the sequences can be done in a fairly small space (not all over the room) which makes it perfect for use in a hotel room on the road. I have done this workout many times, interspersed with other DVDs, and I'm not tired of it.",1355875200,,429,4.180722891566265

This great routine gets your heart rate up, works on key areas that really feel the burn, and incorporates great lengthening and stretching. When jumping on the bike or going to the gym are not an option this is a fantastic workout and leaves you feeling both thoroughly worked-out out but also healthy and energized. Great workout, I highly recommend it!",1350691200,,543,4.494949494949495
3984936,5,B002TJ68O2,"I'm 43 years old and have been terribly inactive over the last 6 years, gaining a lot of weight.  I am familiar with, have been a faithful student of and even have taught aerobics classes in the past, so I have a knowledge of aerobics.  But I certainly have not used my knowledge over the years and am terribly out of shape.

With that said, this DVD has been perfect to get me going again.  Ellen is very pleasant and encouraging.  The moves are just what my body has needed to shed some initial weight (perhaps around 10lbs so far since using this video for 2-3 weeks).  I'm sure, if I continue along this path, I may bore of the same routine and find myself already shopping for some new material.  But I am forever grateful for the jump start this DVD has given me.  It still gets my heart rate up more than it's been used to and it makes me sweat.  Don't be afraid to buy this if you are just starting out.  Ellen does a good job explaining the moves.  With a bit of a background, I realize there are a few things she's leaving out and I needed to readjust my positioning on a couple of moves after a couple of workouts, but overall, she makes it easy to follow along.",1349740800,3,1173,4.168888888888889
3984937,5,B002TJ68O2,I've done a lot of Ellen's workouts and love them all. I'm currently 4 months pregnant and was looking for one that didn't have mat work (to stay off my back). This workout did it for me. I worked up a nice sweat....even could feel my abs working while standing. My arms were tired by the end from holding them out the whole time. I also like the 2 variations for if I'm feeling not as energetic. I'll be using this workout for the remainder of my pregnancy.,1335571200,,458,4.215909090909091
3984938,5,B002TJ68O2,"I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and this workout was challenging.  It's not your typical cardio routine because you are barefoot, but it is graceful and powerful.

I've done Ellen's Crunch DVD focused on cardio pilates from years ago, but I finally found more DVD's by Ellen Barrett -- this one -- and it is a FANTASTIC update, with even better toning moves. Even better: she achieves it without forcing me to lie on my back on a mat! It's better than ever before, and I love it! No backaches. A good solid cardio and toning workout.",1294963200,3,442,4.273809523809524
3984942,1,B002TJ68O2,"Nothing happens on this DVD- no workout, no challenge, no variations.  It's ineffective and painfully boring.  I was unable to elevate my heart rate or break a sweat.  This is my first time returning a DVD.",1293494400,5,206,4.666666666666667
3984943,5,B002TJ68O2,I love this woman and her videos...the Barefoot Cardio is excellent...anything by her will get you in shape without feeling like you don't want to do it.  Very effective!,1292889600,,170,4.862068965517241
3984944,5,B002TJ68O2,"But I love this!  I fell in love with Ellen immediately.  She is a trainer for smart people...she's not obnoxious, and her moves are just smart.  She really works out your core to your fingertips throughout a calm but energetic cardio routine.  I will purchase her entire collection.",1291507200,4,283,4.833333333333333
3984945,5,B002TJ68O2,"I love Ellen Barrett and this style of workout.  It contains a lot of graceful, full-body moves.  The workout has a cardio element as well as stretch and toning.  Ellen's style is so refreshing--you actually look forward to turning on the DVD and enjoying her enthusiastic instruction.  I especially enjoy working out barefoot--it encourages balance and really makes the workout more enjoyable.  I don't enjoy high impact workouts or routines with choreography that is impossible to follow.  This DVD is a pleasure because you can master the moves and feel that your body is getting a benefit.",1284595200,4,593,5.061855670103093
3984946,4,B002TJ68O2,"This is a challenging workout.. It really makes the whole body work hard and if used for a period of time, results will be very obvious. I love Ellen, she makes good workouts, the best I've ever used.",1282176000,2,200,4.2894736842105265
3984947,5,B002TJ68O2,"I love the way Ellen Barrett puts together her routines. I am just getting back into the groove of exercising after way too long being out of it.  Today was the first time I did this workout, and wow, it was challenging. I noticed that I had to modify moves more toward the end of the workout, and I look forward to being able to do the whole video at a high intensity soon.",1280275200,3,374,4.054054054054054
3984948,5,B002TJ68O2,"Intense yet gentle on the body! It's harder than it looks-and works with the female body not against it. There are no jerky movements, and you're left feeling stretched and worked at the same time. Ellen calls running/biking linear and repetitive moves, while Barefoot Cardio moves incorporate ballet, pilates and ""mindfulness"" to extend the body in all directions. It's a great flexibility, strength and light cardio routine in one. I'm trying to lose ~15 lbs so will use Jillian Michaels/Cath Friedrich/Jessica Smith workouts for the majority of my workouts, but for recovery days, or days that I just want to work my body and feel feminine at the same time, or when I reach maintenance levels, I will use this.

To punch up the intensity, i'm also planning on doing pony whenever she says happy feet. Something to work up to...

The music is soothing but energizing and cool at the same time...

Enjoy your barefoot workout!

3984949,5,B002TJ68O2,"I have always been a fan of Ellen, but I don't have any of her Studio DVD's. I almost didn't get this because I thought you should wear shoes while working out. But, since reading up on homeopathy and natural health, I found that going barefoot isn't all that bad and encouraged due to the stimulation of the neural pathways, similar to reflexology and how it helps your internal organs and so forth.

I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and didn't think it would be a very hard workout either. I was wrong; half way through I was working up quite a sweat. A very nice change of pace from my other exercise DVD's.",1278979200,5,620,4.391304347826087
3984950,4,B002TJ68O2,"I purchased this dvd as the result of being injured and bandaged from my hip to feet and unable to wear sneakers. This workout is like modern dance and vinyasa flow yoga.  It's fun, and I actually worked up a sweat.  The workout feels good and is easy on the body.",1277337600,2,264,4.1568627450980395
3984951,5,B002TJ68O2,"I'm new to Ellen Barrett, and she has become of my favorite instruectors.  when I first did this DVD, I thought it was too easy.  My heart rate definitely was elevated but, this isn't a ""heart-stopping, dripping sweat"" type of workout.  Ellen describes it as the new style of exercising--mind/body exercise. She incorpartes movement based on ballet and pilates. The more I did the workout,the more I liked it.  I feel relaxed and energized when I'm done.  One of my main focusus when I exercise is strengthening my core. I think good posture is so important, especially as one gets older.  A hunched over woman looks older not matter what her age!  This workout definitely works the back, upper arm and shoulder muscles as do her other DVD's that I have now purchases.  I can tell that I'm standing straighter and stronger with more ease.  (I'm 60 years old.)

As one of the other reviewers said, I find that I have to do additional, traditional strength workouts to complement Ellen Barrett, but I certainly do her workouts 3 or 4 times a week.",1277078400,5,1045,4.66120218579235
3984952,3,B002TJ68O2,"At first, I was not too satisfied with this video. I found the postures awkward (toes turned out, shoulders back...) and, as someone else mentioned, a little repetitive at times (Happy Feet/Pony). Also, there is a lot of upper body twisting and at one point I think I strained my back, and swore off the video, putting it up for sale on Amazon.

I gave it about three ""one more try"" runs, and now I like it pretty well, surprisingly.  I like the ballet inspired moves; I feel graceful by the end of the workout. Also, I always do work up a sweat. The moves are slow and controlled, but require more energy than you would think, to do them correctly.  Once I learned to control my movements a little better, and not go too far on the twisty-back moves, I didn't hurt myself anymore and could actually enjoy the workout.

It's a good change of pace from some of the other higher-impact workouts I do - no knee pain here! That is actually why I chose this particular one - I was having knee pain from all of the jumps in 30-Day Shred and didn't want to completely ditch my workout routine. I also own Ellen's Skinny Sculpt video, and have to comment that I just love her demeanor. She comes off as very genuine and relaxed.",1275955200,9,1220,4.337719298245614
3984953,5,B002TJ68O2,"I bought this workout specifically because it is low impact yet very cardio.  I have severe arthritis in both knees.  I can no longer do any high impact workouts. As the title says, you should do it barefoot on a yoga mat that will not slide around.
  It starts out seemingly easy then works up to a point where my heart rate is in a good cardio zone and I am sweating, but not out of breath so I lose my form.  I like that throughout the workout, Ellen stresses ""mindful"" foot placement and focus on the total movement.  Her cueing is excellent and there is a choice in ""happy feet"", which is a side to side movement, between wide stepping or going into the pony side to side which I am unable to do.  I still have good range of motion in my knees even though they are very creaky and bone on bone.  If you have arthritis with limited range, this may not work for you.
  The movement is a full body full range of motion workout.  The motions are fluid and sometimes ballet like.  Ellen stresses taking deep breaths in and out as in yoga so as not to hold in tension.  The workout does as she claims, leaves me feeling like I have had a great cardio workout, energized and relaxed.  If you are looking for a workout that will raise your heart rate without hurting your joints, I think this is an excellent choice.",1269820800,17,1313,4.220883534136546
3984954,5,B002TJ68O2,WOW!! Ellen this is perfect for sore overworked muscles but is still challenging and gracefully toning. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to feel great and get some great arm toning and ballet like physique. Love it love it love it!!!!,1269475200,2,243,4.809523809523809

I love that I don't have to get shoes on for this, and altho' the music is low, it's good because it keeps you from wanting to overdo it; the workout is not so much jumping around as using your muscles to elevate the heart.

I have bad knees, so finding her workouts has been very helpful for me. I do like working barefoot, but due to an old ankle injury I may wear shoes for this workout. But it's not required.

She is very upbeat & motivating in a friendly way. It's a fun workout for days when you want to get your cardio in, but you want to take it a little easier.",1425340800,,465,4.166666666666667
8380189,4,B002TJ68O2,"I had this workout shortly after it came out and gave it up because of some of the repetitive moves. Then, I reacquired it and will keep it this time, because I've learned to modify it so that it works for me.

Ellen is in a bright open studio, backed up by two exercisers, one of whom is the modifier. This workout is comprised of several long combinations during which you do moves on one side and then the other with additional moves thrown in. You are supposed to do it barefoot - sometimes I do, sometimes I wear shoes.

I really like the combinations and I find that I really enjoy the moves that she does. My heartrate gets up there some, but it is not an intense workout. The two things that I don't enjoy about the workout are the happy feet/ponies (there are a LOT of them) and how much you hold your arms outstretched (most of the workout). So, I have learned to modify. I just do side steps while they do happy feet/ponies - this is kinder to my knees. And, I put my arms down during moves I don't feel like I need them. I either have my arms by my sides or my hands on my hips.

Instructor Comments:
Ellen is in a class by herself, I think. Beyond the encouragement she does to do the workout, she so believes in the mind/body workout method. It's hard not to get caught up in her enthusiasm.",1423699200,2,1305,4.170634920634921
