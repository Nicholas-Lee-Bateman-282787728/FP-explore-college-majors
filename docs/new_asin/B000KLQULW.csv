2695978,4,B000KLQULW,"Its kinda hard for me to admit that I watched LAGUNA BEACH and this premier season of THE HILLS, especially with all the jokes I make about the two series.  But being the exact target age of both shows (20 years old), I feel into the original LAGUNA BEACH watching it as it aired durring the final stretch my senior year of High School so I have a small emotional connection to the show as the characters where going through the same things tha I was when it was on the air.

Season's two and three of LAGUNA BEACH though where boarderline annoying and I found myself barely ever watching them.  But THE HILLS is different, Lauren was always my favorite 'character' and it was pretty interesting to actually see her grew out of her teenage self and into a young woman - and  all the fictionalization that came along with it...

THE HILLS follows Lauren as she moves to Los Angeles (But I'm pretty sure its Santa Monica), and how life changes for her as she enrolls in Fashion School and gets an internship at Teen Vogue and all the Drama that comes along with her roomate, coworker, exboyfriend, and growing up.",1165017600,23,1111,4.45320197044335

She always seemed to be in it for something other than friendship and she treated everyone bad! Tho I'm sure Jordan now can thank his lucky stars he's not with her anymore....Lauren was always my favorite but you take her plus the lovely miss Whitney and you get gold.,1431993600,,475,4.804878048780488

Young gals, please watch this clip and learn how *not* to interview for a job, school placement, or internship. Both Lauren and Heidi bomb terribly. Had Lauren been an unknown person, she never would have gotten that position with Teen Vogue.

2696112,5,B000KLQULW,"Despite all the gossip / drama swirling around, The Hills Season 1 is very addictive!  If you like reality television, you'll enjoy this DVD!  You'll want to just keep watching episode after episode!  Highly recommended!!",1288742400,,221,5.257142857142857

2696114,1,B000KLQULW,"What has the world of entertainment come to when this is the sort of crap that infests television screens? Is it any wonder illegal downloading & piracy is so high these days, it's cause no one is watching TV anymore, at least not new shows... it's left to no more then about 20 reviewers here saying they love this show so much... 20, out of everyone not only in America, but around the world, who have to suffer this kind of entertainment-less garbage... when you look at the overall result, the big picture says, very few people are watching this putrid pile of .... and if they do see it, they don't give it a second glance. Well, being forced to have to watch more then 20 mins of this, I broke up with my now ex girlfriend because she loved this show about a few Beverly snobbillies who cry about their boyfriends cheating on them and their hair not looking right... these people of the so called ""reality"" show, well, it's not really a reality show, it's just the actors contracts state that no one will ever hire these dorks to work again because of their horrible career decision to appear in this show, well, unless that moron from Dawsons Creek decides to revive a ""Who Cares Whatever Happened To Those Nobodies"" in about 10 years from now.

How can anyone possibly sit around watching these snobs so called ""Day to day"" lives? Oh it must be the following of the fake blond who is using daddy's credit card to buy herself another dress with matching shoes and a handbag that her ugly little dog can fit in? Or maybe it's trying to guess which one of these losers will go broke soon and not have a clue how to survive in the real world now that her boobies have sagged and her plastic surgery has melted. standing around screaming, ""why did my ""friends"" ditch me when I could not afford to waste all day at the mall with them anymore... it's like they only talked to me because we where the rich snobs who won't know how to survive in the real world when our daddy blows all his money on a drunken rampage of gambling addiction in the near future""

Now all you people who wanna defend this crap, come on with your comments about how i misspelled something, or need grammar school... you're just showing ignorance instead of waking up to yourself and realizing, ""Oh yeah, he's right, I do need to get a life""",1280102400,,2317,4.398601398601398

2696117,5,B000KLQULW,"This season of The Hills is my favorite, because it was when Heidi, and Lauren were the closet of friends, now five years later things have changed a lot. I am not happy the way things turned out. It's sad, because I think they would of lived through their friendship longer than it lasted if it wasn't for Spencer, and the fame that he wanted out of it, and I think he used Heidi to get fame, and to get money. It's sad what Hollywood can do to your relationships. I think this is the only season that is pure, and not as scripted as the other seasons. I have watched all the seasons at least twice. Things come, and go in life, and sometimes you even get more than what you asked for. I have to say this I am proud that Lauren left The Hills on her own, I knew she wasn't in it for the fame like some others. I see Lauren as a great role model. Lauren has been on Seventeen Magazine four times now, that's amazing, and I am proud of her. I think everything Lauren has, she has worked hard for as shown in this first season, she could be anyone's best friend. I think this is a must own season, because it shows what people go through starting out finding their way for themselves.",1265155200,5,1182,4.121212121212121
2696118,5,B000KLQULW,"I love traveling with Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, Heidi Montag and Whitney Port throughout the glamorous life that is Hollywood, CA. Ever since the Hills came out on DVD, I have been absolutely intrigued and enthralled whenever I watch the girls on this reality show. This show is packed with drama, emotions riding high from Lauren traveling to New York City, only to deliver a dress to Lisa Love, West Coast editor at Teen Vogue, to Heidi hating her new ""dream job"" at Bolthouse productions.... I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show, and recommend it to ANYONE who wants to watch the glamorous life of California!!!!!",1249084800,4,626,4.915094339622642

2696130,5,B000KLQULW,"I can watch these dvds over and over, if not only to relive the drama, but to als enjoy the music and the clothes the girls wear. I know the show is scripted, but it's still very entertaining.",1234224000,3,192,4.078947368421052

2696133,5,B000KLQULW,"My sister and I loved Laguna Beach and especially Lauren Conrad (L.C.). I was deployed in 2006, when The Hills Season 1 aired, but my sister told me about the show and said that I would like it. Once I returned from my deployment, MTV wasn't airing the episodes any more. As soon Season 1 came out, I purchased it on dvd; now I own all three season's! I'm a faithful watcher of The Hills! I am currently deployed, but I plan on buying Season 4 as soon as it's released on dvd!",1221350400,,476,4.129032258064516
2696134,4,B000KLQULW,"The storyline isn't that unrealistic and it's not always about shallow things or subjects. It's pretty realistic to me (when you're a wealthy person) and the characters are facing normal 20 something issues. I know,it's a little bit clich sometimes but it has to be this way,after all,it's a 20 year old girl point of view on life. The only thing I'm complaining about is,and still is these days,THE CHANGING OF SONGS! Don't MTV have enough frickin' money to afford songs by Ashlee Simpson,Good Charlotte or Imogen Heap?!Even Everybody Elses's song rich girl,poor girl was replaced! God! enough already! A SHOW WITHOUT IT ORIGINAL SONGS IS NOT THE REAL ONE,IT'S LIKE A MOVIE,MUSIC IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING!...",1220745600,,715,5.016806722689076
2696135,4,B000KLQULW,"Did I mention all of the drama these fun white girls get into and involved in? Lauren Katherine Conrad by far is my favorite character as she was on Laguna; very , very friendly, sweet, a great friend, down to earth, fun and just so darn love-able. ^_^

But you soon realize that she gets back stabbed at every other turn and her heart breaks over and over. I guess we have that in common!

This drama-fest takes place in Los Angeles, California for a while...she meets Audrina there, and they become close. After a while, she is offered a job behind-the-scenes at a modeling agency. She decides to move to San Fransisco and then the drama starts soon after she meets Heidi.

Heidi meets Spencer, who tries to tear the now-best-friends apart, like my cousin's girlfriend did. See the similarities? Anyway, after some odd lonely nights, Lauren finds the sexy Brody, and they end up sharing their interests, digging each other and totally hooking up. Then, another ""friend"" of Lauren's hooks up with Brody on New Years Eve. Lauren has HAD it with her, and thinks Brody isn't the problem; it's Jen who has been a friend since childhood.

Drama, drama, drama, drama. But it's fun. Especially if you liked Laguna Beach and what it entailed.

2696138,3,B000KLQULW,"The Hills, like Laguna Beach, is definitely a guilty pleasure. I usually watch silly shows like this one when I'm in lab working on projects since they don't require a lot of concentration. Season 1 seems to stress on nightlife and boys, but seriously LA is more than just nightlife and boys. I suppose these kids are young, and their parents are rich.

2696157,1,B000KLQULW,"The only thing worse than a 'reality' tv show, is a steaming pile of garbage posing as 'reality.' This non-sensical journey into the vast nothingness (from where the minds of its viewers apparently dwell) is the most insulting installment of such a format. I found myself the subject of a torturous hour set of this gawd-awful piece of crap and not only was I praying for the good lord to strike me down out of mercy, I was wondering how the hell anyone could actually believe this pathetic 'reality' series is actually... real. Everyone knows that there is no such thing as reality televsion and that there are many scripted elements to such shows. Its bad enough that reality TV is a mind-numbing experience many of of us voluntarily subject ourselves to so we can escape from the awful truths of human nature and feel better about ourselves for a few moments, but at least there is barely a shred of something 'real' within. This is just pure drivel. Valuable time wasted by the typical MTV audience: the audience that will never evolve...",1188864000,11,1042,4.699453551912568

Who wants to know about the other caracters in Laguna Beach. I thought she was the one who was focused about what she wanted. The serie could definitly be a insight for girls who want to dropp out of school. For instance Heidi I hope she will try to get to college back even when it's night school. I did it and have a bachelor degree. I will also go to university to learn Japan. So to get back to this DVD. It fantastic a real documentary and definitly fashionable like the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"".
