I get aggravated at the doctors, because they only look at one symptom instead as looking at all of symptoms as one problem. I have been down that road...",1494288000,,350,4.014285714285714
8315443,5,B001KN3MOC,"This show is so incredible.  I found out what was wrong with me because of it and I imagine many others have too.  As a matter of fact, they had a show of a woman with a mystery illness and at the end of the story, she said she figured out that that is what she had because of watching Mystery Diagnosis.

8315444,5,B001KN3MOC,"Works fine in my Blu-Ray player, no issues like some other reviewers have had. However, I actually purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother, who will be watching with a DVD player - hope it works for her too. The ""viewing experience"" is a bit odd, the episodes don't seem to match too closely with the labels on the discs, the menus are extremely limited, but again, I'm just glad that this show was available to purchase at all. Picture quality is definitely SD, but this show is not something you watch for the graphics anyway. So glad I could find it somewhere! Hope other seasons become available.",1387756800,,604,4.5504587155963305
8315445,5,B001KN3MOC,"As usual some very good mystery diagnosis stories. I wish they could have all the episodes on CD.

A bit expensive though as there are only 3 stories on the CD (if I recollect correctly).",1386892800,3,187,4.3428571428571425
8315446,3,B001KN3MOC,If you can get past the bootlegging in this DVD series you will love it. A bit over priced but if your a health junkie as am I this DVD is just for you.,1337385600,4,152,3.5
8315447,5,B001KN3MOC,I cant get enough of mystery diagnosis and I couldn't find it for sale any where else so I'm glad amazon sells it.,1330214400,3,114,4.0
8315448,3,B001KN3MOC,"The DVDs work in my girlfriend's laptop but not her DVD player. Also, the labels are wrong on the DVDs. Still, they work somewhere and there are some episodes I have not watched yet.",1330041600,4,182,4.382352941176471
8315449,5,B001KN3MOC,"I downloaded this video to share with my daughter.  I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome a few years ago.  I believe my mother has it.  I want my daughter to be aware.  My mom has had her tear ducts plugged to keep her eyes moist  The procedure has failed on me twice.  So has cauterizing my tear ducts.  Since I live in the desert, my eyes are constantly burning and scratchy.  That's just one symptom.  Like the woman in the story, I had numerous dental caries, stomach problems, lost my gall bladder, had a hysterectomy, overwhelming fatigue, and terrible joint pain.  Just like this patient, my husband and I tried to get a diagnosis besides ""you're crazy"" for years.  It was a relief to hear a real name for a real disease, and there can be serious consequences.  I want my daughter to be aware, and to make her doctors aware, that this is a real possibility.  I don't want her to go through years of testing and frustration.

I highly recommend this video, and the series, to anyone going through puzzling medical situations.  You're not crazy. Keep seeking answers.  The right doctor is out there somewhere.",1278115200,4,1117,4.593908629441624
