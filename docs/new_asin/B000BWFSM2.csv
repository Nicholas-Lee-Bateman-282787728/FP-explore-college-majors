pursuit with emphasis on fame and fortune but as a deeply human activity
undertaken by dedicated  professionals.  Very inspiring.  Quite unique,",1313366400,,217,5.294117647058823
8128971,1,B000BWFSM2,"Based on the description I purchased this with high expectation that I would be able to utilize some of the material in a course I teach on creativity, but found absolutely nothing of value. I'm sure that the presenters were well-meaning, but unfortunately it's a collection of ""C and D list"" (sorry to be harsh, but true) performers/artists who have little to offer in terms of creative insight - perhaps that's why there's only one other review in addition to this one - no one's buying the DVD. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1304812800,,533,4.621052631578947
