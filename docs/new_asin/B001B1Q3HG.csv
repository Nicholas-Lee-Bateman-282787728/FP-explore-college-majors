8281317,5,B001B1Q3HG,I first saw this wonderful boipic on PBS a few years ago and loved it.  Always wanted a copy of it but couldn't find one.  Am glad to have it now.,1380758400,,146,3.6774193548387095
8281318,3,B001B1Q3HG,"This wasn't too bad, but it's not really a must-buy for those interested in the Romanovs.  It's accurate and gives a nice synopsis of her life, but it's designed to be show on TV as an hour long documentary, and so it can't get very detailed.  I've also seen better archival footage on other films.  The books ""25 Chapters of My Life"" by the Grand Duchess, or Ian Vorres's book ""The Last Grand Duchess"" would give people a better sense of her as a person.",1378944000,2,455,4.329411764705882
8281319,5,B001B1Q3HG,"I found this historical DVD very entertaining and am very sad it is not
available.  I think more of these types of DVD/Videos need to be available.  It is much like the video I also saw on a local PBS station a series about the Grandfather of Europe. It is very interesting to see how many of the current monarchs are related back through history.  Especial for a country that does not have kings/queens or Csars.  This is part of history and should be available to anyone interested in the subject matter.",1241308800,,506,4.467391304347826
8281320,5,B001B1Q3HG,"I'm so sorry to see the DVD for Olga: The last grand duchess is 'not available.'  I saw it on my local PBS station, and it's a wonderful hour.  It's a joint production of Canadian and Danish TV, with superb production values, historical accuracy.  The story is riveting, non-sensational and poignant at the end.

The ""Olga"" in question  was the sister of the late Czar Nicholas.  She lived the rest of her life, after the Soviets,  abroad, and died 1960 in Canada. She never really enjoyed the 'royal stuff' and managed to carve out a life for herself almost as a 'normal' citizen.

I'd love to see it again, on DVD, but apparently that's not to be.",1232841600,2,649,4.487179487179487
