8135776,1,B000H0MN76,"Arguably, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Thank God, I rented it instead of buying it!  Horrible acting.  Ridiculous plot.  Terrible lighting.  Atrocious creature effects.  Absolutely no redeeming qualities.  Be warned---this is not worth viewing!",1320537600,,256,5.756756756756757
8135777,1,B000H0MN76,"A witch with the sole purpose to give her friends souls - and the rest of humanity - to the Egyptian god of the Underworld - Anubis - procures a book of spells and an ancient tablet from a shop dealer. She then convinces her boyfriend and his friends to come into the woods with her to call up Anubis. No one really believes that she can do so and just think that she's crazy. To make a long story short, blood is needed to call upon the jackal-headed god. The witch ends up summoning Anubis and chaos ensues.

When I first read the synopsis on the back of the DVD I thought it would be a fairly good movie. But I was wrong. The camera angles reminded me too much of ""The Blair Witch"". The camera jumps around a lot and never stays in one place for very long. The fight scenes are slow and unbelievable. And the god Anubis, who is supposed to be a jackal-headed deity that protects the dead, appeared like a giant dog who needed to be put to sleep. Pun intended. The acting was like watching a junior high play. Immature, slow, and borish.

""Ancient Evil: Scream of the Mummy"" was MUCH better than this second movie. It had better acting and wasn't boring. If I could I'd give this movie 0 stars.

So if you plan on watching this movie, it would be safer to rent it first. Don't make the mistake that I did and buy it before viewing it.",1190160000,6,1336,4.170542635658915
