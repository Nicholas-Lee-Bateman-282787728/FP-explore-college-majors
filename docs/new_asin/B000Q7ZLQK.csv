2833641,3,B000Q7ZLQK,"saw this film the other night and it was quite interesting with the chick trying to pass as Black.  Ray Liotta and LL Cool J really have good chemistry in this film. this just might be LL's best acting performance yet. Liotta has been type cast for years for his earlier career roles,but he turns in a good performance here. this film flips back and forth at times. Mekhi Phifer does a good job as well.",1187913600,2,403,4.302631578947368
2833642,5,B000Q7ZLQK,You realize that you truely have no idea who is who. Who's telling the truth? How did the DA end up with a dead man in her bed? Who is Nora really? Who is Danny? Whats 5am? Slow burn has so many twist and so many rabbits chasing the carrot that you'll be glued to the screen until the end trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Definately worth watching!!,1187395200,6,365,4.083333333333333
2833643,4,B000Q7ZLQK,"I got this movie with no expectations.  Sure it has Ray Liotta and LL Cool J, but their movies tend to go either way.  This went really well.  Liotta plays a DA who is trying to run for mayor on a ""clean up the streets"" campaign when his right hand associate DA winds up with a Dead Man in her bed.  Watch the movie unfold as he looks for the head of a major Gang under the pressure of a timeline that at 5am something is going to happen, what, who knows, rent this movie.  The acting was decent, the tale is suspenseful, and ignoring the fact that you really do see what is coming in a few aspects, there are others that actually surprise you a bit.  Good action, worht a spin in the DVD player.",1186876800,3,696,4.043795620437956
2833644,3,B000Q7ZLQK,"SLOW BURN is a film that has much to like, much promise, and a cast of trusty actors to bring it off.  The problem with the result is in director/writer Wayne Beach's hands and especially in the editing job on the completed film. It is like watching a 'follow-the-bouncing-ball' film: there are many surprises and subplots and altered identities that keeping a score card of where the story is going is a bit difficult.

Reduced to the bare bones the plot takes place in a 24 hour period during which District Attorney Ford Cole (Ray Liotta) and his Assistant DA Nora (Jolene Blalock) are in a showdown with a significant crime boss Luther Pinks (LL Cool J).  Nothing is as it seems, as irritating flashbacks attempt to prove, and in the end the good guys and the bad guys are difficult to appreciate.  There are some excellent performances by reliable actors such as Taye Diggs, Mekhi Phifer, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and  Bruce McGill, but the plot depends on a significant point of the confused racial identity of Jolene Blalock's character, and though she acts well, the part would have been better served by an actress like Nicole Ari Parker, to name just one.

The problem with this supposedly enigmatic thriller is that the astute viewer will see through the plot far too early.  But given the quibbles, it is good to see these actors at work, especially the underused Ray Liotta.  Grady Harp, August 07",1186185600,3,1403,4.721311475409836
2833645,4,B000Q7ZLQK,"it is a cop action movie that feels like a open ended mystery (the audience doesn't know who did it and has to figure it out as the main character does).
It has several interesting and, to me, unexpected twists. Worth watching as closely as you would to Columbo or Perry Mason, not shallowly like a strictly action genre.
I appreciated this, these twists and false rabbit holes, it not only kept the movie moving and interesting but were deep enough that i missed several, a real treat.

I hope that the world isn't like the movie, that our cities aren't built by people like this with such greedy motivations, but as i get older, i wonder more and hope less for the good to triumph.",1185580800,16,683,4.420634920634921
2833646,4,B000Q7ZLQK,"Just released yesterday, I missed this one in the theaters, but now got the chance to get it on DVD. Not bad. Ray Liotta plays Ford Cole, a District attourny in the middle of a campaign for mayor when crisis hits. His beautiful Assistant DA, Jolene Blalock, gets caught up in a ""self defense"" killing at her appartment. How is this going to reflect on the DA, will it hurt his Campaingn against crime, particularly organized crime. The film takes off from there, having plenty of twists and turns, but this DA finds himself in a struggle with time and in a confusing game tracking down what actually happened this night at his assistant DA's appartment...and it has connections to what he always wanted, the Kingpin crime lord.
It was entertaining, nice pace and action/drama. Nudity/sex scenes not really needed and overdone, and I caught on to what the ending would be about midway through, but the story was good enough to keep me drawn in just to make sure I was right. Check this one out, another overlooked film with Ray Liotta, who had another good film a couple years back with ""controll"" that had a short theater life. If you say that film, than this one you'll like as well.",1185408000,3,1184,4.589622641509434

The lead woman especially had horrible delivery.  Haven't see her in anything else, but seeing her in this movie doesn't inspire me to find anything else she was in.  And why does every movie have sex and pillow talk in it?  I mean it's just boring because every movie contains it.  It's become cliche.",1471478400,2,478,4.814814814814815

2833706,3,B000Q7ZLQK,"it goes COMPLETELY off the rails at the end! This movie actually does a pretty good job of grabbing your curiosity from the beginning. LL Cool J is not the good guy, but is he the bad guy? This movie will have you asking Is she or isn't she? Is he or isn't he? Did she/he do it? Ray Liotta's performance is fairly understated and not overwrought or overly dramatic. You won't know who's the good guy or who's the bad guy. No one is who they seem to be. Guy Torry is rather wasted and they don't really need him as a sidekick for Liotta. By the time this movie gets to the last 10 minutes, it tries so hard to keep you guessing literally until the credits roll that it goes off the rails to a rather unsatisfying ending. Otherwise, it's very suspenseful.",1432771200,3,753,4.2

2833809,5,B000Q7ZLQK,"""Slow Burn"" is as easy on the brain as an escapist dime store crime novel; the kind you read on vacation while laying on a beach in the tropics sipping a sweet rum drink you wouldn't be caught dead holding in your favorite bar.  Filled with twists, turns, good guys, bad guys, and one mastermind in charge of it all, it keeps your attention from beginning to end as it fillets one red herring after another.  None of the actors had to stretch to play their roles as each presented a noir monotone character that leaves you believing each knows more than they're telling.  The music score is perfect for this film.  The sex is cheap and easy, the kind you know too well is going to lead to trouble but can't resist.  At no time do you know exactly who is pulling the strings so you keep watching.

""Slow Burn"" isn't a great film, but it's a great example of exactly what it was intended to be; a dime store crime novel revealed at 24 frames per second.  The first time I saw it I thought it was a one-watch movie, but it grows on you.  Don't be surprised if it ends up one your widescreen time and time again when you're in the mood for something dark and gritty.  It delivers on both levels.

The DVD images are almost Blu-ray sharp, presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to fill a widecreen HDTV.  The Dolby 5.1 sound is exceptional. The price of a perfectly good used copy is pennies plus shipping, exactly what you need to pay to fully enjoy the movie.",1310342400,2,1452,4.282051282051282
2833810,3,B000Q7ZLQK,"Okay, I confess. The only reason I purchased this DVD was Jolene Blalock.  As a big fan of her T'Pol character on ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", I was curious to see her in another role.  In ""Slow Burn"" she has a variety of ""looks"" and is clearly the hottest thing happening in ""Slow Burn"".  Anyway, the movie is just okay, although entertaining, and will keep you wondering who's who until the end. As long as you don't overanalyze the plot line and are just looking for an hour and a half of escapism, you'll be satisfied.",1261612800,,518,4.431578947368421
2833811,4,B000Q7ZLQK,"Ford Cole's (Liotta) got some political ambitions.  Unfortunately, he's got to get rid of a shadow-man to realize his move from DA to mayor.  Danny Luden's a shadow--some say he's got at least a dozen people with fake IDs claiming to be him just to keep ahead of the law....

Add to that, his prize ADA and lover Nora (Jolene Blalock) has a dead man in her bed.  She's claiming the man raped her, but the evidence is stacking up against her.  Add to that, an is-she-or-isn't-she question about Jolene's racial identity and you've got viewers attention.

Stir in LL Cool J as an informant with the dirt on just about everyone and you've taken the plot from simmer to boil....

""Slow Burn"" is aptly titled and it's great contemporary noir. It's rare I don't figure out the solution well in advance of the end and this is one of those films that kept me guessing until the end.  Plus, the music chosen for the soundtrack is superb.

2833812,5,B000Q7ZLQK,"Disagree that there are too many takes of Ray Liotta's reactions to what is going on.  Ray Liotta IS the reason I love the film.  He is dramatic and that's the way his fans like him.  Liotta is highly under-rated.
Also, loved the Irma Thomas music.  ""Sister"" Irma Thomas is finally getting some mainstream exposure.  The rain hides the pain...
Just wonder which of her albums this was taken from?

2833813,5,B000Q7ZLQK,This was a very well put together movie. If you like Unusual Suspect then you will like this as well. You don't know who is the man. Keeps you thinking. Mystery.,1194048000,,161,4.225806451612903
2833814,2,B000Q7ZLQK,"In the opening scene of ""Slow Burn,"" an assistant district attorney (Jolene Blalock) is found wandering the streets of the city, disheveled and confused, informing those who find her that she has just killed a rapist in self defense.  The alleged attacker (Mekhi Phifer) was a man she supposedly met one night in a record store and who then proceeded to stalk her for weeks thereafter.  Suddenly, into the head D.A.'s office strides LL Cool J, as a friend of the deceased who has a considerably different story to tell about the events leading up to the murder as well as an entirely disparate take on the couple's relationship.  Things get even more dicey when we discover that the D.A. (Ray Liotta) and the assistant D.A. have been conducting a torrid affair of their own for a number of years now.

""Slow Burn"" fails on so many levels of rudimentary storytelling and filmmaking that it's hard to know where exactly to begin in compiling a list of its shortcomings.  To start  with, there's something inherently self-defeating and pointless in constructing a narrative from two widely conflicting viewpoints - a la ""Rashomon"" - when one of the supposed eyewitnesses is already dead and, thus, unable to personally relate his side of the story.  How does it enhance the verisimilitude of the tale if most of our information has to come filtered down to us through a secondhand source, a person who wasn't even present at the events he's describing - unless, of course, he was hiding in a nearby closet during all those ""intimate"" moments he is able to recount in such juicy and exhaustive detail?  Either that or the murder victim was one of the chattiest, kiss-and-tell gossips in the history of the movies.  And why does it take till the closing reels for the supposedly intelligent professional investigators to smell a rat in that setup?  Eventually, the twist-and-turn plotting leads to so much incoherence and confusion that you might well wonder if the filmmakers themselves understood what it was they were doing.

Beyond the clumsy, inscrutable storytelling, ""Slow Burn"" also suffers from some of the most overripe dialogue this side of ""The Black Dahlia.""  With such knee-slapping howlers as ""She stood there like a tangerine, ripe and ready to be peeled"" and ""She walked in smelling like mashed potatoes and every guy within thirty feet wanted to be the gravy,"" the script could easily win First Prize in a Bad Film Noir Writing contest.  It's hard to believe at such times that the film isn't actually intended to be a parody (the acting sure suggests it on occasion).  On second thought, perhaps it would be best to stick with that notion; it just might go down easier that way.",1190764800,7,2692,4.823913043478261
