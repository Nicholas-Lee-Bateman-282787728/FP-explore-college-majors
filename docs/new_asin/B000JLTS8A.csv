Welcome  back to Ireland and your favorite townsfolk in BallyKissangel---well, actually, all of them are not on board for season 5, but enough of them are for this season to be an enjoyable one nevertheless.  Father Aidan's return, in my opinion, is crucial herein.  After 3 years of Father Peter Clifford, it's welcoming to have the same local priest around for a second year running.  The priest is, generally speaking, the central focus of this drama set---and filmed---in Ireland; in Avoca, in case you're in the Dublin area.  It's not too far away for a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar if you're driving south. Interestingly too, Don Wycherley, who plays Father Aiden is Tina Kellegher's (Niamh) real-life brother-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program.

Change is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring), is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.

And also returning, fortunately, are the characters of Sean Dillon, and Orla.  So there isn't much to complain about regarding season 5 (well, of course, there are some things, but not worth harping on here as they aren't that troublesome). I wish the same could be said about season 6, but unfortunately, that's when a slew of characters leave the show.  So, enjoy this season all the more!  Cheers",1170979200,20,2256,4.803617571059432

2675860,5,B000JLTS8A,"The characters in this show are so engaging.  They aren't perfect or even likeable at times but they are good people ... people trying to do the right thing and live life to its fullest.  They experience the same struggles that we all do and, in telling their story, the program deals with complex topics.  Each telling is done with sensitivity and kindness.  Ballykissangel is a wonderful combination of idealistic and realistic in that it shows real-life situations but is missing a lot of today's brutality.  It leaves me feeling like I'd love to live in this community.",1424390400,,573,4.8061224489795915

2675864,4,B000JLTS8A,"I sure do miss season 1-3 characters, but I have gotten attached to Fr Aiden, He is a good person. This season is has a sad feel, the loss of Ambrose makes me want to cry for Niahm and the the situation she is in. Bryan Quigley has stepped up to the plate and is taking good care of Niahm and Keiren. I was so sad to hear of Tony Doyles passing (I know that was at least 7 years ago as it is now 2015) I also was sad to hear of Birdy's death.  He just mysteriously disappeared from the show.  Anyway this season was very serious, I missed the humor and connection of the characters. It seemed a bit lacking in this season.",1420588800,,622,3.968

2675888,5,B000JLTS8A,Found this show years after it had aired.  Became completely enchanted with it.  Very sad it only lasted 51/2 seasons.,1420156800,,118,4.85
2675889,2,B000JLTS8A,As I said in season 4 review.  The writers/producers continue to change characters with each season.  I give this season an even lower rating because of this continuous change of actors.  It is too bad.  It was such a great series for the first 2-1/2 years.  I miss it but I will watch no more of the Ballykissangel seasons.,1419984000,,324,4.423728813559322

2675893,4,B000JLTS8A,Series has become a little more dramatic and less comical...I preferred the former. Seem like many of the original actors are bowing out and the story line is suffering some. Still it is good TV.,1419206400,,195,4.6

2675896,3,B000JLTS8A,I think the show is turning into an American soap. It's still worth watching but the early seasons were more fun.,1418515200,,113,4.428571428571429
2675907,3,B000JLTS8A,This season is not what the first three were. The characters are getting tiring and that storylines are less engaging. It is still a charming town and the scenery is great.,1418515200,,172,4.580645161290323
2675908,4,B000JLTS8A,"The fun continues in the village. There are moments that are laugh-out-loud funny and other where it takes a hard heart not to become misty. It really does take a village to provide so many fun characters.
And the honed Irish way of poking fun at things never fails to come through",1418083200,,281,4.423076923076923

2675941,5,B000JLTS8A,An addictive series with colorful characters....lots of significant moral studies imbued with lots of comedic moments....which there wasn't such a high turnover of characters but perhaps that's why it's so addictive...you never know what's coming next.,1416528000,,252,6.027777777777778
2675942,4,B000JLTS8A,"It wasn't as good as the first 4 seasons.  I still think the scenery, acting and the interaction of the stars is really very good.  I think the series could very well stopped after 4 and the new priest was a little hard to get use to.",1416441600,,234,3.9574468085106385

2675989,5,B000JLTS8A,This series has been a delight to follow. I feel like I know what rural Ireland is like now. The strength of the show is the strong characters in the ongoing story line.,1413676800,,169,4.151515151515151
2675990,5,B000JLTS8A,The cast and the story line are great as were all the seasons. I would have preferred some communication from Padraig and Orla in the season following their leaving.  I wish that the series had continued past season 6.,1413676800,,218,4.589743589743589

Quality is excellent.",1413244800,,213,4.35
2675996,5,B000JLTS8A,I enjoyed the whole series.  If you like Doc Martin you will probably enjoy this show.  My only quibble is the way they constantly drop characters..  Only about 5 of the main characters make it through all 6 seasons.,1413072000,,216,4.487179487179487

2676038,5,B000JLTS8A,This is an interesting and enjoyable series. Lots of humor as well as pathos and the problems of every day life.

2676057,3,B000JLTS8A,"This season of Ballykissangel leaves much to be desired. For one thing, the priest is insipid and the plot developments are weak. The scenery is still gorgeous, and Donal and Liam are funny at times, but the overall effect of this group of shows is just blah.",1409875200,,259,4.531914893617022

Considering how unfeeling and unwilling to work things out with Ambrose, I grew to dislike he. She had outgrown him and blamed him for it.

The first couple of seasons had real teeth and Irish humor to them and although some of the later ones kept that going it began to enter into the realm of soap opera as opposed to storytelling.

The characters seem to be more distant to this viewer than what the first couple of seasons offered.  Killing off and getting rid of characters is not what the viewers want.  A decent departure would be more acceptable.  Since McClain Stevenson was killed in MASH, this seems to be a way to totally eliminate them from ever coming back to the series.

New characters taking over plot lines--a bit hard to take. That being said, maybe the reason I like it so much is the real life feel of human changes we all experience.  It was all done in the small village where I felt at home.  It is worth your time, money and emotional input into the stories.  Don't skip Season 5!!!

2676251,4,B000JLTS8A,I enjoy this series because it is about real people and the way they deal with issues in life. In contrast network tv presents people in a more stereotypical way. Consequently I rarely watch network or cable tv.,1394496000,,211,4.578947368421052

I find it distressing that so many of the curates and many of the actors and actresses seem to move on so quickly. I'd like to see them continue in the story for much longer",1393632000,,389,4.1866666666666665

Liked Father Aiden but wish they'd done more to develop his character beyond the occasional appearances.  We anticipate watching series 6 but doubt it will be the same given changes we've read about.

Despite the sad departure of Father Clifford, I came to love Father Aiden. The character development and plot twists have just the right combination of drama and humor to get you hooked!

2676283,3,B000JLTS8A,I loved Seasons 1-3.  Then slowly characters started to die or disappear.  As I have arrived at Seasons 5 and 6  the quality of the earlier stories is dwindling and I miss the original characters from the previous seasons.,1389830400,,222,4.641025641025641

Others are impossible to understand.  I get so frustrated because I want to watch it, but it's just impossible for me. Besides that I have a hearing problem.

The soap opera between Niamh and Dillon was interesting & drove the plot, but then they dropped it far too early. Reading the other reviews, it seems that fans agree seasons 1-3 were the best, so I'll give those a go. Also, why is Colin Farrell even in this season? All he does is feed the animals and do farm work. He seems expendable, like the writers couldn't figure out how to eliminate his character, so he just keeps showing up randomly. I'll keep watching because I like the scenery and their accents ;)",1382832000,,585,4.425925925925926

Interestingly, the two characters I liked more as the series progressed were Liam and Donal. In my opinion they became funnier, especially after their employment with ""Mr. Quigley"" came to an end (spoiler alert).

Why can't the USA film makers bring us shows such as this?  Worth every cent!

2676461,4,B000JLTS8A,I liked season 4 although after season 3 the series lost momentum in general and seems to be somewhat adrift in refocusing on content while introducing additional personalities. Season 5 gets some traction with the bittersweet details of Niamh and Sean and introduces Ambrose's replacement.

It also has some really bad moments. The writing for the characters continues to be spotty and the core actors of the show continue to flee at an alarming pace. This was the last of the half-way decent seasons. The last season, 6, is a total disaster. Stop watching when you've finished this season and I think you'll be ok with the show in general.",1363392000,,510,4.3125

2676495,3,B000JLTS8A,"Ballykissangel started out as one of my favorite shows of all time. The first two seasons were absolutely sterling with a brilliant, well developed and endearing cast. I won't mention any plotlines as the story up to now is far too good to spoil for anyone. But let me just say that I saw the beginning of the end in Season 3 with the appearance of ""Uncle Minto"". I knew then that the producers had ""jumped the shark"" and it was only a matter of time. Season 5 saw a respectable effort to rebuild a credible cast and ease it in a new direction, but the magic had already gone. Season 6 was like watching a beloved friend slowly pass away. You didn't like it, but you had loved it too much to turn away. The remaining original cast members appear occasionally and seem uncomfortable as frightened kittens hiding in the corner of the room, waiting for an uncertain fate with a burlap bag and the sound of rushing water nearby. Rest in Peace Ballykissangel - ""May Ye Be Half an Hour In Heaven (48 minutes actually) Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"".",1361145600,,1048,4.435233160621761

2676521,5,B000JLTS8A,"I have to start by saying that Ballykissangel is a television series filmed in Ireland and the entire 6 years are available on DVD. This review is about Series 5, although I must include references to each of the years of the Series. The people that you will meet in the fictional town of Ballykissangel will make you laugh, cry, get mad, feel sorry for, and love. Their lives intertwine throughout the entire 6 years with a core of characters who are featured for the entire series. There are some major characters that leave and little vignettes with new and fleeting characters that only last one episode, but it needs to be this way to shake up things a bit. The show centers around a bar and a priest at the Catholic church in town. When you have finished watching all 6 years of this series, you will feel like you have known these people your whole life. And like a really good book, you won't want it to end. Series 5 specifically introduces some new characters to the show who end up playing major parts. You will enjoy all the ups and downs of their lives. I highly recommend Ballykissangel, but be sure to watch it beginning with Series 1.",1349395200,6,1150,4.454976303317536

Welcome back to Ireland and your favorite townsfolk in BallyKissangel---well, actually, all of them are not on board for season 5, but enough of them are for this season to be an enjoyable one nevertheless. Father Aidan's return, in my opinion, is crucial herein. After 3 years of Father Peter Clifford, it's welcoming to have the same local priest around for a second year running. The priest is, generally speaking, the central focus of this drama set---and filmed---in Ireland; in Avoca, in case you're in the Dublin area. It's not too far away for a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar if you're driving south. Interestingly too, Don Wycherley, who plays Father Aiden is Tina Kellegher's (Niamh) real-life brother-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program.

Change is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring), is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.

And also returning, fortunately, are the characters of Sean Dillon, and Orla. So there isn't much to complain about regarding season 5 (well, of course, there are some things, but not worth harping on here as they aren't that troublesome). I wish the same could be said about season 6, but unfortunately, that's when a slew of characters leave the show. So, enjoy this season all the more! Cheers",1308787200,3,2248,4.803617571059432
2676526,5,B000JLTS8A,"I didn't think I'd ever enjoy this series after Assumpta ""died""
and Peter walked away, but the new characters are also delightful

comic scenes interspersed with the dramatic ones keep the fast pace
alive.  I would recommend this 5th season to anyone who has fallen
in love with this small village of Bally-K.",1276387200,,371,4.967741935483871
2676527,2,B000JLTS8A,"I did not enjoy season 5 anywhere near as much as I had the previous seasons.  Donnal and Liam were becoming more and more annoying and they seemed to take up a larger part of each program. I also cringed every time Uncle Minto made an appearance.  Where did they get him?

I knew that many of the characters were just going to disappear without any kind of acknowledgement at the end of the season 5 and figured that it would best to stop watching at that point rather than  be further disappointed with season 6.  I was wrong.  Season 6 is wonderful and you just have to get through season 5.",1273968000,,594,4.258928571428571
