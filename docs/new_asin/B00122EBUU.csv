8243586,5,B00122EBUU,My 4 aspiring little ballerinas love dancing along!!! They are Special Needs ages 1-8 yos & absolutely love it! Great DVD for in between formal lessons to practice!!! Highly recommend!,1510012800,,184,5.166666666666667
8243587,5,B00122EBUU,"A couple of clarifications from the other reviews:

You don't need the accessory bar and mat, if you had them it might be a slightly better experience, maybe? Kids just like to ""dance"" along to the video, if you want an age-appropriate child to actually learn ballet, they need a real life instructor. This is a good way to see if your child has affinity for ballet.",1451001600,,366,4.462686567164179

My granddaughter at 3 through 6yrs old, loved it.",1379289600,,140,4.185185185185185
8243591,5,B00122EBUU,"Daughter is teaching herself dance steps, she keeps up with Bella.  Whether on floor, practicing steps, or at the bar, daughter keeps going as long as DVD runs.",1374883200,,160,4.714285714285714
8243592,1,B00122EBUU,"This is a terribly stupid DVD! The main girl, Bella, way over-acts, the teaching is very simplistic and doesn't really teach at all, the songs are irritating and it's downright brain numbing to an adult to watch this.",1332201600,,217,4.7368421052631575
8243593,2,B00122EBUU,"My three year old has developed a ballet obsession. This video claims to be perfect for beginners and teach the basics of ballet so I bought a set which included the mat and bar.  After the conclusion of the video my daughter was still expecting to be taught what to do with the bar, which is only touched a time or two when the arms come down to rest on it for a second.  It moves way too fast without bothering to explain the moves ahead of time.  The pace seems to expect someone to already be familiar with ballet, yet it is ""teaching"" the very basics such as positions 1,2&3.  The entire thing plays like an irritating commercial redundantly singing ecstatically about Bella ballet.  It could work, if first the instructor would slowly speak and explain what they are doing before singing through it in hyper speed.  There is barley any camera work on the feet to show what to do, though at times they have a split screen showing the foot work in a small box.  My daughter is highly intelligent so she might be able to pick something up from it from repeated viewing, but it was not at all what I was expecting.  She is still singing ""Bella Bella dancerella"" as I type this (as we just finished it and I was so disappointed I wanted to help you avoid disappointment.)  If you just want a cheery video to watch other people dance ballet then this is fine.  I am continuing my search for something to actually TEACH ballet to a little girl.",1327881600,3,1443,4.370786516853933
8243594,5,B00122EBUU,"I give this one 5 stars. Its not perfect (wish I could give it 4.5 stars). My 3 year old (now 4) got this for Christmas and she loves to get into her ballet clothes and just dance around. She knows most of the moves so it keeps her attention and she is really using what she learns in class (the positions and moves). Its a video... not going to teach your kid EVERYTHING about ballet. Its not an instructional professional video, but it does GREAT for my 4 year old and now my 2 year old LOVE it. Its fun for playtime. I recommend it. I know my mother in law got it second hand... not sure we would pay full price. It came with the mat and the bar too.",1288656000,4,653,3.9545454545454546
8243595,1,B00122EBUU,"This video is so stupid ..... It teaches bad technique which is what Ballet is about !
It goes way too fast (It doesn't go over moves before it does them or even explain them). It was even hard for me to keep up and I am an Adult. I would never buy this for my daughter ( we got it as a gift). Especially if you ever want your child to learn any real ballet technique .
Two Thumbs down to this Video( wish I had more thumbs) .",1274659200,2,426,3.7444444444444445
