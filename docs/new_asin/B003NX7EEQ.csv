4161563,4,B003NX7EEQ,"I was truely supprised by this film. My first impression was it was an amateur job. The Cinematography made it look more like a family movie then a horror film. Over lit, my first thought was that it was filmed in ""Eye Popping Techno-Color."" Once I got past my technical misgivings, I quite enjoyed the story. An obvious low budget work, the production company used what resources they had well. The story line was also inventive. It started out as just another haunted house story, but gradually worked in Lovecraftian elements. I am pretty sure that the entity used in this story was Hastur. I'm going to have to check out other films made by this company.",1295740800,5,658,4.632478632478633

4161565,4,B003NX7EEQ,"This is the story of a young woman who, in retreating from a personal tragedy, finds herself wrapped up in a deadly supernatural mystery. What starts as a ghost story soon winds its way into the realms of cosmic horror...

House of Black Wings is an attempt to create a Lovecraftian horror movie on a miniscule budget, and it succeeds on its own terms. The cracks may show in the special effects, and some of the acting is a bit amateurish, but the storytelling and the ideas never falter, and the movie creates terrific atmosphere and some disturbing imagery.

For a sample of what writer/director David Schmidt and his crew can do, I'd recommend checking out his short film The Lovecraft Syndrome, which has some of the same cast members:

4161566,4,B003NX7EEQ,"From BitchBuzz.com: I highly recommend Sword & Cloak Productions House of Black Wings. A few years back, I reviewed their first feature, a swashbuckling adventure called Sword of Hearts and was delighted with the professionalism and good humour of the film which had better sword play than most big budget films. Writer/director David Schmidt has once again assembled a talented cast of people and a whole lot of imagination to make a film that shows everything a no-budget film can be, with plenty of creepy chills. The website describes the film as:

  ""After a tragic act of violence cuts short her music career, Kate Stone is returning to a city full of ex-fans and ex-friends. Taking shelter with her last friend, a struggling artist named Robyn Huck, the two women work to restore the aging courtyard apartment building Robyn has inherited.

  ""But a terrible secret infests the venerable structure, and soon Kate will be haunted by horrific dreams, sinister apparitions, and the sounds of something moving in the walls. She will be dragged into a confrontation not only with her own dark past, but the unspeakable nightmare that lurks beyond the walls!""

I was totally captivated by the mysteries unfolding around Kate and Robyn, the affecting back story for the tragic musician and the supercool and creepy art that Robyn created while the house began to weave its spell into her consciousness. The inventiveness of the special effects and the superbly effective music (an aspect of the process that too many low-budget films neglect to their peril) help create an experience that mesmerizes the viewer.

4161567,2,B003NX7EEQ,this was a small shoe string budget independent movie which I didn't care for but I will say that the makers of this movie were trying to deliver as good a film as possible given they're apparent resources,1289779200,4,205,4.421052631578948
4161568,5,B003NX7EEQ,"Modern film horror is normally about the action. The torture of Saw, the violent actions of the 'soulless monster of the summer'. Horror should be an exploration of character. Of the viewer understanding the motivations of a character so completely, that they go internally into the same unspeakable direction.

David Schmidt provides this portrait in the story of two very broken women leaning on each other for support. Rather than being idiotic victims who won't leave the cabin, in this film, both internally and externally, there's no where else for these two to go. And the horror surrounding and infecting them falls deeply within their own torment.

HOBW's found locations give a solid impression of North chicago, and the ominous, ancient garden apartments left to rot after the housing boom. The pacing is measured, but by the time the darkness caves in around you, you have nowhere else to go either.",1279584000,39,911,5.026490066225166
4161569,5,B003NX7EEQ,"Thank God for David Schmidt, director of House of Black Wings.

In a sea of mindless remakes and sequels, House of Black Wings rises to the top.  Mr. Schmidt gives us a fresh new story line, driven by characters, instead of the desire to showcase make-up FXs.  This is not to say that the film is not without a good splash of blood, but it's not its main focus.  Monsters, neurotic neighbors, ghosts, and lovecraftian wormholes, permeate this film -- as well as multi-dimensional, likeable characters!",1275955200,26,501,4.790697674418604
4161570,3,B003NX7EEQ,"I think this film has received a lot of unjust criticism.  Not many people have even the slightest clue what it's like to make a movie, and while the reviews here may touch on valid points, they come down too hard on what is a pretty well done amateur movie.  This is not ""amateur"" in the perverted, modern sense, where no one involved had any idea what they were doing, but in the sense that these people pursued the movie for the joy of the art.  Though its shortfalls would keep me from recommending it as a ""good"" flick, I think it deserves praise and a viewing from anyone who is interested in independent films.

The film's strongest point is in its technical execution.  The direction was mostly very clear, as was the audio.  I felt that I knew what was happening in any given scene, which is a fundamental skill for any director, but not one that comes naturally by any means (some films with an ""After Dark"" budget manage to screw this up).  The actors did well across the board to carry their characters through the film, though they didn't have much material to work with.  Also, there were few special effects employed in the entire film - I applaud this, as the movie would have completely lost its charm as soon as a hoard of CG monsters came crawling out of the wall or a ghostly shade tore violently through the building in a chase scene.  The supernatural elements are fairly subtle, and that works to enhance the mood.  The setting, plot and sets were all great, and the ending managed a fair amount of tension.

Where the film falls short is in the writing.  The story wants to be very character driven, but halfway through the film I still didn't feel like I knew the characters at all.  Robyn is an artist, Kate is a heartbroken musician and they are good friends.  Beyond that, I can't say I know anything about any of the characters.  I get that Robyn was frustrated and struggling, but mostly from the product description.  She seemed to have mood swings, but she also seemed well adjusted.  Kate was sad, but trying to get back on her feet.  What were their plans?  They had immediate goals and convenient feelings, but I couldn't tell why they thought anything.  Will, it seems, was gay, but had nothing else to offer. These beings didn't have fears or loves or world views, they were just temporary characters in a temporary setting.  The story's supernatural antagonists were also ambiguous.  What did the ghosts want?  What did the other-worldly creatures do?  Why did any of them do anything at all?  I didn't understand the conflict and so it was hard for me to care about anything at all.  Unfortunately,  though I never felt like turning the film off, this did translate into confusion and boredom at times.

Other concerns were the atmosphere and the music.  Though I think it's better to leave out visual effects rather than allow them to completely ruin a movie, it would have helped to know more how the scenes felt rather that just looked.  The end did a better job of this than the rest, but it's hard to feel anxiety about a room that is well lit or a dream sequence that's just a foggy, dark stage.  The music wasn't bad itself, it worked pretty well, in fact.  I just feel that there was too much music, which also killed the mood of the film.

It's hard for me to commit to either recommending this film or not.  On the one hand, I think it was well executed for what it is, and people who enjoy the technical side of media creation (like me), would appreciate this film.  If what you want is a good scare or some great characters to hold on to (most people), I couldn't honestly tell you that you'll enjoy it.  But if you do watch this and don't enjoy it, at least give credit where it's due.  This isn't just good for an independent horror movie, this is far better than many big budget films I've seen and even some highly rated independents.  It just happens that this small crew with limited resources couldn't do the hardest thing to do in movie making.",1336262400,8,4003,4.462809917355372
4161571,3,B003NX7EEQ,"An amateur film made film.

4161572,2,B003NX7EEQ,"This is a three star story, with a three star score, played out by one star actresses against one star production values. The direction gets two and half. Schmidt is clearly competent but still has a lot to learn.

Is it scary? No. There are some genuinely great moments and good scenes but bad acting, cheap effects and poorly mixed audio prevent it from being effective.

The pacing of the story and character development, the acting, the music, the visuals, the sound, all were simply fantastic. Here's how much I liked this movie - I watched it on Amazon streaming, then as soon as it was finished, I turned around and ordered the DVD. Be warned, this movie isn't afraid to take it's time, so if you're looking for immediate gratification, look elsewhere. However, if you're willing to take the chance, you'll not be disappointed. I found it very refreshing  to find a Lovecraftian tale of cosmic horror that doesn't directly adapt one of his stories or creations and yet succeeds as well as this movie does - one of the few others being AM1200 - particularly without the benefit of big budgets or big names attached.

4161578,4,B003NX7EEQ,"WARNING:  If you can't appreciate microbudgeted independent cinema, turn back now, and do not purchase this item.

That caveat aside, House of Black Wings is a fine, creepy addition to the Lovecraftian Horror genre.  While the movie suffers some from being shot on video, they truly make the most with what they have.  The script is well-written (mostly), and while there are few scares, the combination of script, performance, lighting, and inventive camera work from writer/director David Schmidt creates a palpable sense of dread that permeates throughout.

In a way I was reminded of Kurt Vonnegut's definition of Gothic--'a young girl moves into a spooky house and gets the pants scared off her.'  While there's much more to the movie than that, it's certainly the template that House of Black Wings comes from.

Our two female leads turn in fairly strong performances, with particular kudos going to Leah Mylette as an emotionally and physically damaged musician moving into a spooky apartment block run by an old friend, played by Katherine Herrera.  The important thing here is to establish the caring relationship between the two, and the actresses make it work very well.

There are numerous fine touches that, while not commented on in the film, add to the creepiness.  In addition, the makeup effects, while completely practical, create some moments that can make your skin crawl, if only a bit.

And when it comes to the DVD special features, well...the ""making of"" featurette, while only 15 minutes long, is actually more of a production diary, and gives the viewer a fascinating look into the world of microbudget filming.

To sum up:  House of Black Wings achieves more with nothing than most horror films do with studio backing.  Good performances, genuine relationships, fine production design, and inventive direction make this a very worthwhile movie.",1315094400,4,1871,5.132013201320132
4161579,4,B003NX7EEQ,I really enjoyed this low-budget indie.  It was a pleasant surprise with lots of good creeps and chills.  It is a relief to find a decent movie away from the mainstream drivel.  I'd like to see more movies from this production company.,1306108800,12,235,4.5476190476190474
8401349,1,B003NX7EEQ,"there is no way anyone who isn't somehow connected with this film gave it more than 2 stars.  it is not low budget, it is NO budget.  poor writing, poor acting, poor me for buying it!!!!!!",1389139200,,188,4.194444444444445
8401350,3,B003NX7EEQ,"First: I haven't seen this movie. But I found the description of ""House of Black Wings"" highly reminiscent of Lovecraft's ""The Music of Erich Zann."" Even the flaws mentioned in the more critical reviews reinforce this impression. It's a story that sometimes drags on a bit too much, sometimes gets a little to pretentious, and occasionally just doesn't seem to make any sense outside its author's mind (all flaws that appear more or less frequently throughout HPL's career); nevertheless, there's an undeniably creepy quality that definitely leaves an impression.

So can anyone who's seen it confirm whether this is a case of re-titling, re-setting, and superficially altering the characters, but essentially making a more-or-less faithful literary adaptation? Or is it just an assortment of stylistic elements more inspired by Lovecraft's work in general?",1386115200,,857,5.443609022556391

Ok, allow me to begin by inserting some credentials. I just watched this with my girlfriend, and we are both individuals with intelligence high enough to function properly in almost all activities. We have a large library of movies, mainly horror, ranging from Paranormal Activity, The Exorcist, and some strange Asian movies that require a constant feed of potent acid in order to fully appreciate the randomness.

However, this movie completely threw us both off guard. After reading some of the lavish praise that was posted here, we decided to throw down the price of admission to venture forth into an independent movie which was surely worthy of recognition. What in the hell?

First of all, whoever did the costume design seriously needs to rethink his or her stance on what's socially acceptable to wear on your legs, because the pants that this Robyn figurine wears are bottom line atrocious to a point of distraction. I've seen circus clowns look slightly more presentable than this creature from the black lagoon. Regardless, that isn't what makes the movie bad. It makes for some seriously painful scenes where your eyes feel like they're penetrated by a mixture of bleach and antifreeze, and it gives you that feeling in your stomach similar to the feeling you get when you regurgitate memories of Aunt Becky's meatloaf back when you were 5, but alas, the quality of the movie is hampered elsewhere.

The story makes no sense. There's a building somewhere, and 3 people live in it, apparently. Some guy who looks like Doc Oc from Spiderman, just a lot less intelligent, some hipster guy with nothing to his name except for a guitar and an exceptionally large set of ears, and the land-lady who thinks wearing normal pants is a blasphemous sin. None of these characters seem to be related to each other in any kind of way. Strange behavior is explained because ""the building"" is messed up. There's some strange reference to something that happened in the past regarding a duct-tape fetish that went horribly wrong, and a lady with wings who plays the violin.

This all pales in comparison to the ""troubled past"" our lead character seems to have, which involves some guy with a mohawk (that he can apparently attach only when the scene calls for it) and his untimely death at the hands of a level 80 Warlock who quit eating Cheetos in his mom's basement long enough to shoot the poor guy at his own concert. How this is all relevant to the movie makes absolutely no sense.

I understand the need to make an indie movie about things that are out there, but oh my God. I've been to Nebraska. I've finished all the Katamari games on consoles. I can solve the Rubik's Cube. This movie was just all over the place and made 0% sense to me. This could also be due to the fact that the acting was terrible, the music was eye-rollingly cliche, the story was uninteresting due to its dislodged nature, etc.

Perhaps the movie explained everything perfectly clear. I was just too mentally distracted by the disturbing nature of Robyn's wardrobe to notice.",1343260800,2,3067,4.764595103578155
8401358,4,B003NX7EEQ,"""House of Black Wings"" is a delight for any fan of Lovecraftian weird fiction, as it centers on the juxtapositioning of mundane reality with horrific glimpses into the dark cosmic void.  If you are looking for gore or cheap thrills, this movie is not for you.  It maintains a steady pace, building the two main characters as they are drawn into the terrible lure of the creatures who inhabit the old apartment building.  The film also has a minuscule budget; ergo, the special effects are nearly non-existent--and the look of the film is quite basic.  Yet the film succeeds through character development and a haunted, brooding atmosphere.  If you like intellectual horror (or simply a good, weird story), ""House of Black Wings"" is right up your alley.",1342310400,7,752,4.889763779527559
