We venture up into New South Wales in this set and visit Sydney. A wealth of guest stars pop up in this set including Colette Mann (returning as Doreen Burns briefly) Anne Charleston (Madge from Neighbours)as a policewoman, Darius Perkins (the first Scott from Neighbours), Tony Alvarez (Tony Garcia from The Young Doctors), as well as Shane Bourne, Babs Wheelton, Peter Ford, Andrew McKaige, Kevin Summers, Julie Nihill among many others.

One of the more annoying storylines from the series featured Lainie and ""Ellen"" who appear in this set. This is probably the most unbelievable storyline in the whole series. The Halfway House continues to feature alot mainly to support storylines involving Judy Bryant (Betty Bobbitt).

What will end up to murderer Nola McKenzie (Carole Skinner)? There's a new doctor around in the form of Dr Scott Collins (Tim Elston). New prisoners include Zara Moonbeam (Ilona Rodgers) who comes in useful in Joan's war with Bea (Val Lehman), Maggie May Kennedy (Davina Whitehouse), Laura Gardiner (Roslyn Gentle), Carol Colsen (Merrin Canning), Petra Roberts (Penny Maegraith) and the legendary Pixie Mason (Judy McBurney).

Is America better than Australia? One of the ladies in Wentworth certainly thinks so and this does not please the other women.

Originally screened for the first time in the UK from August to October 1989 in the Midlands and during the 1990's in the rest of the UK, this is the final full boxset featuring Bea Smith. This set also features the last episodes as a regular character for Erica Davidson (Patsy King). Colleen Powell (Judith McGrath) soon gets her short stint in the chair before being replaced by Ann Reynolds (the late Gerda Nicolson). we also meet Joan Ferguson's (Maggie Kirkpatrick) father (Carl Bleazby) in one of his few short stints in the series.

Enjoy reliving some quality 80s Aussie soap!",1340236800,,2066,5.0087463556851315
