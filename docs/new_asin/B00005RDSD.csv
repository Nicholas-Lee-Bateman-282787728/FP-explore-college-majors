8591092,5,B00005RDSD,"This is the best snowboard DVD I have ever seen.
There are a lot of great riders like Travis Rice (who just won the X-games slope style), Gigi Ruf, J.P. Solberg or Jussi Oksanen (who does a couple 1080s that means three rotations).
Most of the tricks shown are in back country, not in actual competition, which I find good. The thing is though, that these guys are some of the best snowboarders in the world, because they can also win the competitions. Many of them are also test riders for Burton.
Also the filming is beautiful. With that I mean that it is kind of surreal from time to time, meaning that there is a lot of slow motion or extraordinary camera angles.
The tricks themselves are simply insane.
With just over 30 minutes the film is kind of short, but there is also additional stuff with amounts to around 30 minutes and you never get bored how matter how often you watch it!
It's simply a great DVD.",1017792000,5,914,4.382352941176471
