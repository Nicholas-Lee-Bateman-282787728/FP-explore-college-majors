Now movie ... oh YES, if you love Aamir Khan's performance, like to be drawn to the screen inpatiently following unusual story-lines he creates, enjoy action movies (and in this one he really does all the actions!) and want to see Aamir's metamorphosis (into fantastic look and physic) - you gotta have it!!! I watched this movie 3 times in 2 days right after I got it ... some of the scenes are very emotional and hurting ... so expect to get overwhelmed at times - but it is intended this way. Aamir is so extraordinary fascinating in his role - in dramatic swich of his character mid-movie ... Plus very romantic and sad love story ... I HIGHLY recommend to own this movie and watch with your better halves - it will enhance / increase value of your relationships and importance of each other! Enjoy it!!!",1265241600,4,884,4.462962962962963
