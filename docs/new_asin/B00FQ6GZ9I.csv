8617943,5,B00FQ6GZ9I,"This is my favorite movie of all time in a great release.

I saw this movie the first time in all its glory, when it was re-released in 1989 in theaters. Since then I had the Laserdisk, then the DVD and of course the Blu-ray when it came out. I checked and was wondering how such a long movie would fit on 1 BD. Picture quality was very good already, but not as great as I wished it were. I checked reviews of this Japanese release and bought it after 3 days of researching all over the net. Picture quality is up a notch and seems to be a little more detailed than on the regular BD. If you are sucker for the best possible version of your favorite movie get this one. Highly recommended",1433116800,8,688,4.0962962962962965
