He was a prolific author, a scientist/naturalist, an explorer, a philosopher. QUOTED from an eloquent review:
Explorer, admiral, Rough Rider, war hero, and President: Theodore Roosevelt was a man of enormous popularity and legendary achievements. Known as the conscience of the nation, Roosevelt s progressive policies called for a square deal and an end to corruption. A social reformer, he lobbied for women's rights, better labor conditions, and aid to farmers. He secured 150 million acres of timberland as national forests, negotiated the construction of the Panama Canal, won the Nobel Peace Prize, survived an assassin's bullet, plunged in a submarine, and flew in a Wright Flyer.",1452902400,3,856,4.993006993006993

8672965,5,B00MMPB4Y2,"This is an outstanding documentary on President Theodore ""Teddy"" Roosevelt. It was made by Harrison Engle in the late 1970s and it took him 8 years to produce. Originally released in 1986 and now for this special collector set, it is one of my favorite biographies to own on our US Presidents. It chronicles his life from boyhood to President and beyond. Actual footage has been used and restored whenever possible and reenactments were also used, using actors closely resembling the President and his family, giving us viewers of today a glimpse into what it may have looked like at those moments. It is also narrated by veteran actor George C. Scott with the music of John Philip Sousa. The set includes a beautiful package housing the documentary DVD, a nice Memorabilia Booklet with text overview of his life and descriptions of the memorabilia copies included in another booklet, with his name and photo. A beautiful CD of John Sousa's music is included here. All in all, well worth having in your collection of documentaries. Please check your local retailers also, you may find a good deal on the set as I have. It did not cost me as much online.",1428710400,5,1153,4.741293532338308
