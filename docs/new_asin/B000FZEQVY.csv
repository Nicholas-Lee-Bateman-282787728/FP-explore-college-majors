2593240,5,B000FZEQVY,"Two girls find their friendship ruined by envy and insecurity. When one of the girls is seriously injured and later dies, the title WISHING STAIRS come into play. The story quickly becomes an all out horror fest, complete w/ a psycho-killer, ghost, and strange murders! This final part of the ""GHOST SCHOOL TRILOGY"" is my personal favorite. Enjoy...",1270512000,,349,5.0344827586206895
2593241,4,B000FZEQVY,"As I have noticed Korean Horror is better than Japaneese horror. Even though most of American Horrors were Japanese movies and converted to American like The Eye, but Korean Horror is totally different. Wishing Stairs is one of those movies. It is highly recomended for Horror Fans.",1266796800,,282,5.0212765957446805

8127714,4,B000FZEQVY,Having seen 3 whispering corridors movies I'm still not sure which is my favorite. I really liked this one because the hole stairs thing had me intested I liked how they had the hole movie done and the plot was enjoyable. Unlike the other movies in the series I've seen this one was more fast paced and had alot more horror in it. This movie will likely have you thinking even after the movie is over its that good.,1493942400,,415,4.265822784810126

8127717,2,B000FZEQVY,"An isolated, all-girl boarding school in South Korea harbors a supernatural urban legend - a stone stairway, leading up to the girls' dorm, with 28 steps that - if your desire for something is truly deep, when climbing thems - a 29th step will suddenly appear on which, if you make a wish, your desire will come true.  A fairly cool premise, but the first rule of a scary movie is that it be scary - and this is where Wishing Stairs fails.  Hardly anything weird happens for half the film, as it lines up the story of two best friends - both studying ballet - whose friendship goes south when one gets too competitive.  We also see another student, a fat girl, who suddenly and swiftly drops a lot of weight after wishing on the 29th stair.  But by the time the scares do come, even with a few good moments, they're both weak and anti-climactic.  I'd forgotten this was the third of four semi-related films in the Whispering Corridors series; haven't seen the others, but supposedly this is the least scary - and after seeing it, I'd bet that estimation's true.",1423267200,,1061,4.476683937823834
8127718,5,B000FZEQVY,Excelent! I really liked this movie! Finally after a lot of search i found it and i am really satisfied with it,1402358400,,111,4.090909090909091
8127719,3,B000FZEQVY,"Not quite as good as I remembered, the story isn't too interesting. Not too much horror either. I'm not sure if this is really worth watching to be honest.",1392940800,,155,4.379310344827586
8127720,4,B000FZEQVY,"I saw this movie a few years ago and then bought it to watch at a Horror Movie Night. It is not super scary but it is interesting. A story about two best friends competing for a spot in a ballet school and a plus-sized artisitc girl, all three who find their way to the Wishing Stairs. The Wishing Stairs, if you believe, say the words, and walk properly up the steps, your wish will be granted.  And as with most granted wishes, their are twists.",1391299200,,447,4.1976744186046515
8127721,3,B000FZEQVY,"Once again, we are treated to a scene where a teacher slaps a student.  How did this high school ever get its accreditation?

This is the third in a series of movies about ghosts roaming the halls of a high school.  (It doesn't really matter what order you watch them in as they are unrelated but for their theme of hostile ghosts seeking revenge.)  This time the story concerns two girls vying for a single spot in a Russian ballet school.  Presumed friends, one girl (Yun Jin-sung) turns jealous and vindictive at the thought that her friend (Kim So-hee) could automatically ""win"" the spot on sheer talent alone.  To gain unfair advantage, the jealous girl takes to the wishing stairs to secure less than divine intervention.  That, and a good shove down a flight of stairs soon settles the matter (she cripples her friend who then commits suicide).  To further complicate matters, enter a freaky girl (Eom Hye-ju), who is bizarrely devoted to the dead girl and wishes her back.

As with the other films in this series, the aggrieved ghost puts in a late appearance: nothing frightening, nothing that hasn't been done, nothing spectacular.  Until that time, there are a lot of pedestrian wanderings of earthly beings going to classes, ballet and more ballet and ballet again.  Several times too many, they show girls hiking up the stairs counting as they go (if you want to learn to count to 29 in Korean this is the movie for you!).  Otherwise, not exactly the horror movie I was expecting.  Okay to watch once but nothing I'd care to sit through again.",1380931200,,1556,4.697416974169742
8127722,5,B000FZEQVY,"A recurring theme is again done with intelligence and skill.
Great HS girl dialogue...realistic in content.
One question...are all the girls in Korean HS beautiful? And even the ghosts are 10s.",1357776000,,193,5.258064516129032
8127723,5,B000FZEQVY,"Here we have one of the Whipsering Corridor movies, where two girls are our central focal points. They have this thing at the school they attend - apparently there is a way where you can get a wish from the ""wishing Stairs"" that are located outside one of the buildings. You simply climb all of the stairs, counting them, and an extra one will appear if you pray to the right spirit. The only problem is that this spirit is not much of the helping variety - it is more of the tricking/ screwing up your life type.

I liked this movie quite a bit and have to say it has all the things that makes the Whispering Corridor movies what they are. It has two girls that are the main people, a bizarre little story (this one has a folklore idea in it and I'm not certain if it is make-believe or it is actual folklore), and it has the all-girls school we get to know and love. It also has the creepy factor that outweighs the gore factor in any way - these movies ar emore angry spirits and revenge than anything else - and that isn't a bad thing. The only negative, and the reason it would lose any momentum, is the ending in which the spirits ALWAYS do almost the same thing (this one deviates a bit, though, so that's cool).

If you like your foreign horror, want some spooky story where two girls do mean things to one another to break bonds or to move ahead, then yu would like these movies. They all bring something good to the table and all of them are a bit off. I like this one and momento Mori the best, followed by the Voice. That's all that are out as of now, and they come with a good vote considering how much of this type of horror is out there.",1282003200,,1652,4.127329192546584
