8347255,3,B001W9SNYI,The movie is my alltime Favourite. The print was good but the cover looked old and was torn from several places. This is one of the genuine movies out of the very few made in bollywood. Deserves a blue ray or Ultra. I would have given 5 stars but since I am a collector I am disappointed with the Case/Cover of the dvd.,1484352000,,319,4.079365079365079
8347256,2,B001W9SNYI,"13B (Vikram K. Kumar, 2009)

I've probably seen a half-dozen Bollywood attempts at horror since I started this all-consuming Bollywood phase of my movie-viewing existence back in 2005 or so. To a one they've been horrific (and not in the proper way). There's just something about scary monsters that doesn't mix with romance subplots and big musical numbers, you know? But I keep telling myself that if I dig deep enough, I'm going to find the perfect Bollywood horror film. And this brings us to my viewing of 13B yesterday. This second feature from Vikram K. Kumar kicks off with an interesting, if derivative, storyline, and then brings in the cheese...and keeps heaping on block after block until, by the end of the tale, the movie smells rather like a fromagerie. (Honest to Limburger, if you don't see that final scene and laugh like a loon, you're lacking a funny bone. The pathetic thing is, it's not supposed to be funny.)

Plot: Manohar (3 Idiots' Madhavan) and his extended family just got a killer deal on a brand new condo. They move in and set about getting the place livable, but odd things start happening. In the opening scene, we find out that milk bought just the day before has already curdled. Manohar's phone works everywhere else, but takes distorted pictures in the apartment. Their blind neighbor in 13A, Kamdar (Black's Dhritiman Chatterjee), has a service dog who refuses to set foot in the apartment. You know what all these things mean, because you've seen more than three horror movies in your life. Meanwhile, the women of the household have found themselves a new series to watchbut when Manohar catches a glimpse of it one day, he realizes that the events portrayed in the TV show bear startling parallels to the lives of Manohar's own family and friends. Manohar, with the help of his pal Shiva (Jaane Tu...Ya Jaane Na's Murli Sharma), a police inspector, has to figure out what's going on before the events being foreshadowed in the serial come to pass.

It's not a bad conceit, which is shown by the fact that it's been done so many times before. But it is entirely lacking in horror-film atmosphere. Thus my statement above that the normal Bollywood trappings don't mix with horror films, but there's also a huge amount of unnecessary exposition here that undercuts any tension the script (written by Kumar) may have been able to generate. Show, don't tell is the golden rule in media for a reason. And this is why that last scene, which I don't think I've ever seen work well, here ends up being laughable; given enough atmosphere, it might not have worked, but it would have at least been mildly effective.

Ultimately, the two best thins about this movie are (a) for me, it reminded me that I need to go back and watch 3 Idiots and Black, both movies I've been meaning to get round to for years, and (b) my son, who will be two in a few months and is entirely enchanted with Indian film music (I've got an Asha Bhosle Pandora station set up just for him), found the music video that plays over the end credits fascinating enough that he actually stopped dancing for a while just to stare at the TV. (I was not nearly as thrilled with the song as he was, but I'm not going to complain about the video all that much.) I continue to hope that one day Bollywood will come up with a fantastic horror movie. After seeing 13B, I need to keep looking. **",1382227200,,3386,4.6009933774834435
8347257,4,B001W9SNYI,"Unique thriller set in India. Cool to watch another culture, and the story is interesting.  The family central to the story is a bit Brady-bunch in their happiness and connectedness, but I really enjoyed it.  Also, got to love how the Bollywood movies always have the folks unexpectedly break out into a video moment during the movie! :)

Entertaining and a nice change of pace from recent US thrillers.",1353196800,,403,4.811594202898551
8347258,3,B001W9SNYI,"The good news or is it that this movie has been sourced by a leading Hollywood studio for a remake. How the tide turns after recycling countless Hollywood movies Bollywood is inspiring studios in the West. So how is the movie? It depends.
Madhavan and his brother are upwardly mobile and pool their resources and buy a lavish house for themselves in a multistory building. Their apartment or flat number is 13 B. As soon as they move in trouble starts brewing starting with the milk turning sour every day. Then the family gets hooked on to a TV Show called Sab Kairiyat. This show strangely echoes Madhavan' s life and gives him a preview of what's to come. Some of the scenes are scary and the direction is passable. The resolution could have chillier. If you like horror movies, then this is lite stuff but still enjoyable it could have been scary. Madhavan is okay playing the frantic person, rest of the cast are all sugar filled. Poonam Dhillon is wasted and miscast as the mother. My opinion could have been scarier and a bit shorter. I gave it 3 stars. 02/01/10",1262476800,,1069,4.544041450777202
