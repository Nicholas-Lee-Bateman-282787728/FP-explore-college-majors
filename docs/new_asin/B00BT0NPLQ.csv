We have the tools available they just need to be funded.  What is the cost of a fully functioning person/brain.

This is an important documentary to watch if you want to be in the know.",1419033600,,361,4.682539682539683
8573494,5,B00BT0NPLQ,"""The Smartest Team"" is a must see video for all football players and their parents. Brooke de Lench has been an advocate of youth sports safety, especially concussion issues, for years. ""The Smartest Team"" proves you can still play tough and maintain safety standards. This is just the beginning of a safety revolution in football. The NFL,NCAA, UIL, and youth leagues are using the techniques in the film. It is informative for parents and will keep youth football players engaged as well. A must have for every football family and team. Thank you Brooke for letting us all be part of ""The Smartest Team"".  - Gretchen Rose",1371427200,3,623,4.822429906542056
