5462715,5,B00AO1RJOU,If you love detective mysteries this is a series for you. Well written script and the acting is very good.,1379030400,3,106,4.35
5462716,4,B00AO1RJOU,"The collection included three years of episodes.  The first two were interesting but dark and small screen which were okay but not great.  The third year was awesome, now showing in full screen, excellent photography and even a more interesting cast.  If there are further episodes, I am in.",1372377600,6,291,4.8979591836734695
5462717,1,B00AO1RJOU,"if there was anything I could say that was stronger than hated it, I would say it. the stories were awful the actor were worse. I could not even finish the series. I have seen a lot of English police and detective series and I am glad this was not the first or I would have never bought any of the others. do yourself a favor do not buy this.",1370390400,3,342,3.9
5462718,5,B00AO1RJOU,"This product is the first I've gotten involved with Wales as a setting, and has been a remarkable initiation into the Welsh language, etc.  (Not to mention the lead detective's (Phili Madoc) performance.)  Mr. Madoc's interpretation is, in and of itself, as titillating as the original stories that are so unique.  I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates quality stories, plots, and acting to grab this at your earliest convenience.  It's a shame that Mr. Madoc is no longer with us to provide more of this ""goodie"".",1365638400,10,516,4.965116279069767
5462719,5,B00AO1RJOU,"A strong stomach helps while viewing DCI Bain's final series. Mysteries bathed in blood, crime, grit, disgust, death, violence--but also with some rustic, rugged, Welch scenery, & touching father/daughter moments. Welch graphic crime thriller footage and engaging suspense, makes Bain (Philip Madoc--""The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes"" ""The Last of the Mohicans"") is a crack police investigator, a widower, a father of a young girl, with the toughness of ""Callan"" (British thriller series). You may turn away at some of the blood and violence but never turn the set off. Who-what-how-when-where is too complex and draws the viewer to a must-find-out conclusion. His tenderness toward his daughter and the sometimes excess of episode murders resemble ""Midsomer Murders"" (a must hit series). Rough & gritty like ""Murphy's Law"".

""Contains nudity and graphic scenes"" -true to the extreme! Specifically, ""A MIND TO KILL SERIES 1"" is abundant with violence, male and female nudity, blood, foul language, sex, mutilation, race issues, family violence, homosexuality, drug use, and other derelictions that exist alongside murders. NOT FOR KIDS or the squeamish! Unrated Welsh detective drama. But it is well written, high-suspense, thriller mystery drama.

Now for DIEhards, the dark and bloody episode details:
SUBTITLES FOR ALL.

8555122,5,B00AO1RJOU,"Wonderful acting, plots that are realistic and down to earth.  My ancestors were Welsh so I really enjoy this series.  Subtitles are available but I do
not need them as I would with films from Scotland.  We have enjoyed these ""Mind to Kill"" series very much and a solid 5 stars go with them.  The loss of Michael Povey was tragic to the TV world as he was one of the very best.  A must add series for all mystery fans.",1505692800,,418,4.111111111111111

8555124,5,B00AO1RJOU,"We really enjoy this series!!!  We weren't thrilled with the first couple of episodes but we were hooked by the third season.  We aren't quite finished, we have three more shows to watch.  We are very happy that we ordered the collection and appreciate the differences in the Welsh settings and attitudes, not hugely different from the British, but still noticable.",1468454400,,365,4.950819672131147
8555125,5,B00AO1RJOU,exciting British drama series. Wish thy made them over here.,1466380800,,60,5.1
8555126,5,B00AO1RJOU,Brilliant series.,1453593600,,17,8.0
8555127,5,B00AO1RJOU,"I first encountered this series in 1994 when it aired on S4C (British Channel 4 in  Wales).  It was broadcast in Welsh with English subtitles; and, even though I dislike subtitles because they're so much work, I eagerly awaited the next episodes.  The late Philip Madoc (d. 2012) produces a most personable lead character; one never tires of his mellifluous voice (reminiscent of Richard Burton.)  The Welsh accents in this series are quite strong but, if needed, there are English subtitles.  The 21 stories are all interesting and well-acted;  they are not as gritty, violent  or dark as many recent series and nothing is gratuitous.  And, at over 90 minutes long, the plots are intricate enough to hold attention throughout.  Haunting theme music from a celtic flute.  It's a shame this series isn't better known; it's one of the best.",1430092800,,838,4.921428571428572
8555128,5,B00AO1RJOU,Good cop forensic series.  The show has interesting stories and is not afraid to show a naked man or two along the way.  The lead investigator really carries this series.,1409616000,,170,4.633333333333334
8555129,4,B00AO1RJOU,"The first couple of episodes on the first disc are of very poor picture quality, but they improve as you continue the show.  Excellent acting and writing, with thoughtful story lines.  Maybe a little gritty for some.  Some of the episodes are a little weak, but all in all a great viewing buy.",1402876800,,293,4.490566037735849
