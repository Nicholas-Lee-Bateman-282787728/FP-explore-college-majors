4673648,4,B005FAH17K,"This production is a mixed bag. On balance, the performances are good to very good. Anja Harteros as Alcina is fantastic - ""Ah, mio cor"" gets deservedly enthusiastic applause from the audience, and she's equally effective in the other big set-pieces (E.g. ""mi restano le lagrime""). Veronica Cangemi is a wonderful Morgana, with the type of clear, agile voice that is perfect for this character and this music. And that choirboy singing Oberto KILLS. Wherever they found him, I hope there are more such young singers forthcoming.

And then there's Vesselina Kasarova, whose voice is definitely an acquired taste. I have not acquired it yet. She was a great Sesto in a Salzburg production of La Clemenza di Tito and I don't remember being puzzled by her voice in that instance. But having listened to this Alcina I can see why some people love her voice, others viscerally dislike it, and still others (me included) just find it . . . intriguingly weird.

And w/r/t intriguingly weird: this is probably the best description of her acting as Ruggiero. I don't know whether this is weird directing or weird acting, but it comes off as mannered and a little kooky.

But in general, this production sounds good. And it looks good. The opener indicates that the drama is an evening of fun staged by some eighteenth-century aristocrats, and the scene is part drawing-room, part bright blue sky and sea grass. It's pretty. The lighting is nice, costumes are both attractive and make sense - nothing wrong here.

The big thing about this production, though, is that one ends up not caring all that much. Nothing appears to be at stake. The play-within-a-play conceit takes the edge off the drama, and this is not an opera that has a lot of edge to begin with. (Also: the fact that without reading the liner notes you wouldn't know that the aristocrat staging this play-within-a-play was the Duchess of Devonshire indicates that this detail is a little bit pointless.) There is no sense of urgency - the play-within-a-play concept suspends our disbelief for us, and the result is that it's not very compelling. We know that they know that Alcina's magic isn't real. Had the concept been a play within a play that got out of hand and the characters became caught up in relationships that turned all too real - a 'real' enchantment -- then it might work. But 1) then the Duchess of Devonshire racket would probably have to go: it'd have to be less specific 18th century nobles to whom this happened and 2) this would be fairly difficult to get across without some very clever staging and even cleverer acting.

So. I am glad to be able to watch a DVD of this that is easy on the ears and reasonably entertaining, but I'm still waiting for one that's really gripping.",1317772800,22,2753,4.715176715176715
4673649,4,B005FAH17K,"Musically, this production is first rate.  Les Musiciens du Louvre, described by The New York Times as ""one of France's crack period-instrument groups,"" performs fabulously under the direction of Marc Minkowski.  The vocalists--especially Anja Harteros as the sorceress Alcina and Kristina Hammarstrom as Bradamante--are also excellent.

But the staging lets us down.  As the previous reviewer explains, the opera is presented as if it is being performed in the home of an 18th century British aristocrat.  The problem is that this approach adds a lot of extraneous stuff that has nothing to do with Alcina and shortchanges the opera itself.  There's not much to Alcina's island here except a lot of dune grass, and the climactic moment when Ruggiero breaks Alcina's spell by shattering her magic urn is underwhelming.  The blog Likely Impossibilities comments: ""I don't think that [director Adrian] Noble has a single thing to say about Alcina, about the lady's magic or her society.  . . . The frame merely adds an alienation effect, which makes me suspect that Noble doesn't really trust the libretto to work when taken seriously on its own terms.  I think this is a shame, and it helps make this a rather emotionally shallow production.""  With considerable understatement, the Times reviewer says, ""Mr. Noble's approach takes some of the edge off the drama.""

The costumes are very attractive, though, and aside from the play-within-a-play conceit, there's little distracting stage business in the opera itself. The scene in which young Oberto recognizes his father, whom Alcina has turned into a lion, is simple but effective; the choirboy who sings Oberto is extraordinary. The dance movements are nicely done, although I could do without the dancers' hand-clapping in the final chorus.  All in all, this disc presents a very nice evening at the opera, but it could have been even better.",1317427200,17,1894,5.15359477124183
4673650,4,B005FAH17K,"If it doesn't do the mostly static and uneventful nature of Handel's 1735 opera any favours, it's at least appropriate that director Adrian Noble chooses to stage this production for the Weiner Staatsoper entirely within the ballroom of a stately house.  Alcina does indeed feel small and intimate - some might say dry and mechanical - the kind of entertainment put on for the amusement of a gathering of nobles at an 18th century dinner party.  That's not exactly high-concept, but it's about as adventurous as you're going to get for a rare performance of a Baroque opera at the Vienna State Opera, and if it doesn't do much for the opening up of Alcina, it at least recognises its limitations and, under the baton of the excellent Marc Minkowski, it's about as good an account of the opera as you could expect.

The play within a play concept is only really nominally adhered to, the overture used to set the occasion within Devonshire House, where Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire and some guests (you would only know this from the production notes) put on a performance that perhaps appeals to or reflects their nature.  The Duchess becomes the sorceress Alcina, who enchants men and then casts them off, changing them into wild beasts, trees or ghosts, left to roam her island.  Her latest conquest is Ruggiero, who is unaware of his fate, but when his betrothed Bradamante (disguised as a man, Ricciardo) and Melisso, her tutor, come to rescue him, Alcina recognises that she may indeed have real feelings for him.  There are a few additional complications and the usual identity problems with trouser roles to come to terms with and the fact that Adrian Noble's production has historical figures playing these roles, but it's not as complex as it sounds.  The dramatic action is limited and the emotional content isn't that deep, the endless da capo arias expressing no profound wisdom or inner turmoil and no noble sentiments beyond simple expressions of love, rejection and love again, repetitively back and forth as awareness of identities and natures are revealed.  Essentially, it's a case of the power of true love prevailing.

Drawn out to three and a half-hours, those sentiments can become rather tedious after a while, but while Alcina isn't the greatest Handel opera and is fairly static and limited in its dramatic situation, its overall construction is carefully considered and it's worth persevering with for the some wonderful moments and beautiful arrangements that arise out of it as a whole.  The staging and performances from the orchestra and the singers all ensure that those qualities come through.  Marc Minkowski's conducting of the Musiciens du Louvre-Grenoble is wonderful, finding the rhythmic centre of the score, the whole ensemble bright, vivid and dynamic, but with a delicate touch to individual instruments which are picked out beautifully in the sound mix.  The single greatest thing about the choice of staging is the use of a small core of musicians on the stage creating a wonderful connection in their accompaniment of the singers.

Vesselina Kasarova, demonstrates a remarkable range from deep notes to high coloratura seemingly effortlessly as Ruggiero.  Her delivery and acting can be slightly mannered and even distracting, perhaps on account of playing a male role, but I don't think the Vienna audience give her the credit she deserves here.  Kristina Hammarstrmn is a good Bradamante and Anja Harteros fine as Alcina, if a little lacking in character.  There are a few off-notes here and there, but her Act II aria ""Ah! Mio cor! Schernito sei!"" is one of several beautiful Handel compositions here and sung very well.  As Oberto, Alois Mhlbacher thankfully adds some variety to the voices and the repetitive romantic declarations and expressions of disappointment in rejection.  The Blu-ray disc looks and sounds marvellous, with PCM and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 96kHz/24bit audio tracks. The sumptuous staging is finely detailed and extraordinarily colourful and, other than the use of fades and one lapse of rapid cross-cutting, the filming is fine.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese and Korean and a twenty-minute behind-the-scenes featurette is included.",1316563200,14,4256,5.124277456647399
8469826,5,B005FAH17K,"This is a fantastic opera.  I cannot figure out why in every production of this I've seen Alcina puts her tits on blast in some form or another.  Great music, beautiful set design.",1519084800,,180,4.424242424242424
8469827,2,B005FAH17K,"Anja Harteros?  A big vibrato without much Handel style, in this repertory?  Really? I'm afraid I found her painful to hear after awhile, and never was able to complete this opera. I'm a huge Handel opera fan, and am rather familiar with Alcina. These days there are so many fantastically qualified Baroque singers and conductors, there's no excuse for casts which aren't optimal. Why place essentially a Wagnerian soprano into this role?  Some of the other singers were just okay, and some had annoying mannerisms with dynamics.

As for the setting, shall we call it ""competing anachronisms"":?  We segue from the 18th c. into what looks like, um, Bali? A scene within a scene is fine, but this was just confusing. The dancers dressed in Indonesian garb then proceed to dance what looked like authentic 18th c. style early ballet, but they looked ridiculous for some reason, as does the oh-so-typical puffball hairdo on Alcina which stands for our age's version of 18th c. style. After about 1 hour of this assorted nonsense, and having viewed an even worse DVD of Alcina, I decided I would revert to the excellent CDs I already own of Alcina.

I'm sick and tired of directors without any taste who obviously have no respect for the operas they superimpose themselves upon. I see I'm in disagreement with many Amazon reviewers, but then, I've never cared about running with the crowd. I sometimes read a comment from someone who claims to be sick and tired of period settings. I would like to ask these ignorant cognoscenti how on earth they can be sick and tired of normal settings and stagings of Handel operas most of which were completely unknown on
modern stages until the past couple of decades. Come on! If you had made the claim about Tosca, La Boheme, or Aida, you might just have had a point, but when it comes to Alcina, Orlando, Ariodante, Tamerlano, etc. give me a break!  I would gladly fire most of these opera directors and designers and replace them with some sensible designers who are willing to be sensible and also are intelligent enough to see that some of us bring children to the opera and would prefer NOT to see opera singers groping crotches on stage.

A lot of opinions about contemporary staging break down into which character you represent in the fairy tale called The Emperor's New Clothes. A lot of people praised the invisible, nonexistent clothing worn by the Emperor, and only one person pointed out the obvious fact that the emperor was naked.  You can fool most people by charging a lot for a ticket, presenting something in the garb of the sophisticated or high class venu and they will love anything they see or hear.",1465257600,,2657,4.721382289416846
8469828,3,B005FAH17K,"The stage and costume designs are beautifully done. Despite all the visual charms, strangely,  I'm not much impressed by the overall production. Maybe it's the stage direction or editing. I think Kasarova's voice is beautiful, but sometimes I don't understand her tempo and volume control.",1444521600,,289,5.4222222222222225

8469830,5,B005FAH17K,"Alcina particularly lends itself to an opera-inside-a-frame approach. Here, Minkowski, Noble, and Ward have carried this off as high art. The frame is 18th century London with Anja Harteros playing Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, hosting a production of Alcina in her ballroom and taking the part of Alcina. Georgiana's friend Lady Elizabeth Foster playing Ruggiero taken by Vesselina Kasarova makes explicit from the opening moments the stacking of mutually re-enforcing levels (a pants role inside a pants role inside a magical island inside a transformed ballroom on an operatic stage). Both of these leads carry off these layers upon layers of magical and romantic manipulation with the highest musicality and dramatic art. Likewise, this same level of singing and acting is maintained by all the other principals; not a weak link or flawed moment in the whole piece.

Particularly satisfying is the way the dancers are integrated throughout the production. Georgiana has hired a troupe of dancers to augment the roles taken on by her family and friends. These dancers entertain while the others are getting their ballroom performance organized. Then at various moments in the performance the dancers take on silent roles as spirits which Alcina controls or as enchanted former lovers whom she has imprisoned by transforming them into rocks, trees, streams, or wild beasts. The contribution of the dancers reaches a high point with the balletto at the end of Act II, where they carry out Alcina's dream sequence as a dance pantomime foreshadowing the unravelling of Alcina's magical powers.

And for anyone whose had the misfortune of viewing the Hacker and Morabito travesty on Alcina and would like some way to erase that bad taste from your mouth, look no further than this wonderfully wrought tribute to Handel's art.",1393632000,2,1837,5.244897959183674
8469831,4,B005FAH17K,"Musically, the performance is vibrant, delivering both the energy and the poignancy of the score. The credit goes to Marc Minkowski as the conductor. His love of the music and his belief in it shine through and the musicians follow him.

Handel is difficult to stage because with most of his operas, the director has to overcome the romance-novel libretto. Adrian Noble offers an eye-catching and sumptuous but ultimately unimaginative stage: the colours are gorgeous and the lighting luxurious but the emotional range expressed is narrow and the direction uncompelling. The liner notes by Donna Lean illustrate the discrepancy between the music and the stage direction. For Lean, Alcina, `well, its all about sex, isn't it?' whereas for Minkowski, `Alcina is all about love--all forms of love'. I wish that Noble had trusted the communicative power of the music. When he does, as in Alcina's `Ah! mio cor!', the impact is unforgettable. Alas, he often does not.

For lovers of Handel, this Alcina is better both musically and visually than the other version available on DVD today. There is still ample room for a performance in which the stage director goes beyond the surface pleasure of the music and dares to explore its full range of emotional and political possibilities.",1347667200,3,1278,5.080952380952381
8469832,5,B005FAH17K,"This production is a very successful one. If one watches the DVD right from the beginning, one would not miss the fact that the production meant the opera to be a 'play within a play'; and that Ruggiero is actually portrayed by a woman instead of a castrato, and why there are presence of 'men' on the stage apart from the actors and actresses.

The opera itself is splendidly performed. Of the entire performing cast, three sopranos stand out.
Firstly, the boy soprano Alois Muhlbacher as Oberto is simply the BEST portrayal of this characther. He surpasses all the previous sopranos, let alone that on stage, he fits in the role absolutely. Alois sings gloriously. Not only does he own a marvellous voice, but that he also knows precisely how to use his voice. What is even more jaw dropping is that even in his tender age, he is able to perform with dramatic conviction - his vocal acting is truly superb and in the rank of the adult top singers in the field.
As Morgana, Argentinian soprano Veronica Cangemi is clearly more than competent - she pulls off all the arias with real aplomb, and acts with total assurance and conviction. Arguably the best ever Morgana.
Last but by no means the least, Anja Harteros in the title role proves that she is the current reigning Alcina.
Tall and elegant, with a fully commanding stage presence, Harteros owns a lush and fully expressive timbre that really suits this role to a ""T"". Her vocal range throughout all the passages of Alcina is beautifully flexible and highly effective, at the same time movingly rendered in that she imbues her singing and acting with high emotional voltage, and each scene of Alcina in this performance by her is truly exemplary.
The trouser role of Bradamante is competently handled by Hommerstrom, but it does not appear to be her best performance on this particular night of this recording.
The only possible query one may have in this entirely exceptional cast is Ruggiero, portrayed dramatically very effectively by Vesselina Kasarova, but vocally more controversial.
Kasarova virtually 'shifts gears' in each of the arias' differing registers, and this makes listening to her singing tiring after a good while.
However, it would be a gross overstatement to demounce this wonderful production solely for Kasarova's special vocal treatment of Ruggiero.
The scenary and costumes are elegant and tasteful, and all in all, this is a DVD that deserves viewing on top of all others of the same opera.",1335830400,2,2473,4.860189573459715
8469833,3,B005FAH17K,"Staging: makes quite strange impression - it's hard to understand what mean all those chairs and livery servants unless you read the synopsis. The most absurd and annoying personage is a guy, who has been just turning over pages of some book (may be of the opera score?) all through the spectacle.
Orchestra conducted by Marc Minkowski : solid but without magnificence. Though musicians on stage are very good.
Singers: are of different quality. Alois Muhlbacher (little boy) as Oberto is splendid. Anja Harteros as Alcina, Veronica Cangemi as Morgana and Kristina Hammarstrom as Bradamante are excellent. Others are quite good, except Vesselina Kasarova as Ruggiero who doesn't sing at all but declaims instead, trying to fill up the lack of vocal ability by excessive grimacing. Ensembles are negligent - it seems there were too few rehearsals...
Summary: this recording is obviously not among the top ones but is worth watching it. At least once...",1332979200,4,951,5.141935483870967
