8154211,5,B000K3HV4A,"""Fueled,"" expands the big-wave universe to cover the most spectacular spots in the world.

  From Maverick's to ""Jaws"" to Teahupoo, unquestionably the heaviest tube-riding spot in captivity, ""Fueled"" is a definitive look at tow-in surfing and offers the hint of resolution in the controversy surrounding the sport.

In Powerlines previous film, ""100-Foot Wednesday,"" Myers and Nelson detailed the debate between conventional, paddle-in surfers and those using jet-skis, footstraps and a tow rope to ride the biggest waves ever challenged. Through extensive interviews, ""Fueled"" lays out the new rules and regulations being used in Hawaii - a way to save tow-in surfing rather than have it buried by environmental and safety concerns.

  To capture the feelings of surfing's inner-circle, ""Fueled"" interviews cover the spectrum: Darrick Doerner, Brian Keaulana, Mike Parsons, Strider Waselewski, Ross Clarke-Jones, Garrett McNamara (claiming he can hold his breath underwater for 3 minutes and 20 seconds), Brad Gerlach, Noah Johnson and Ikaika Kalama, to name a few. Through their words, the passion and emotion of big-wave surfing come to life.

  The footage at ""Jaws,"" known to Hawaiians by its given name of Peahi, is some of the best ever shown - a 30-foot, glassy day with a lineup of superstars in the water.

  On an expedition to Mexico, Peter Mel, Kenny (Skindog) Collins and Adam Replogle show the possibilities of tow-in surfing in relatively smaller waves, flying around and through sections previously un-negotiable. And for the full-on fear factor, nothing can touch Teapuhoo, filmed on one of the biggest, cleanest swells in the spot's history. This is a wave that simply cannot be real, a sight that continues to astonish. Yet even as 20 or 30 waves go by, each seems more mind-blowing than the last, and as Joel Fitzgerald reminds us, that Tahitian wave is ""suicidal - a little too dangerous for what people are doing out there.""

Add all this to the Powerlines trademark - Maverick's footage, including classic tube rides by Mel, Flea Virostko and Jeff Clark - and ""Fueled"" is a one-stop shopping list for big-wave entertainment. No need to go anywhere else.
