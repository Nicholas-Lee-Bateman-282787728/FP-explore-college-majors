8666281,5,B00LK5RUCA,"This band may be dead, but they are great live.  If you're unable to see them live, this will give you a worthy mummy experience.  It has both a blue ray and a dvd disk of the show.  Runs 112 minutes for 21 songs.  Recorded in late 2013. Sound and video quality are excellent.  There is so much going on you'll have to watch it several times to catch everything.  Amazon selling it for 28.75 but you can find it on the band's website for just under that with shipping.  If you have a few minutes, search both 'Secret Santa' and then 'Carol of the bells' with the mummies for some holiday fun.  Merry Christmas people!",1416960000,,617,4.258620689655173
