8716448,5,B00XPVEWV4,"After watching this video, I felt like I had attended Camp Gone to the Dogs. I recommend this video to anyone just starting to teach their dog to heel or perfecting the movement. The video is well done over several camps days, showing Leslie Nelson working with the camp attendees (canine and human). The best aspect of the dvd is that it contains many examples.  Each exercise is shown being done by many different dogs. Mistakes or simple problems are shown with easy solutions. And of course, all work is done with positive reinforcement and every dog seems to love being at Camp and learning. I am now using some of the lessons on my own dogs!",1435708800,,647,4.52991452991453
