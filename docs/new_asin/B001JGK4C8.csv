3657743,5,B001JGK4C8,"I've always wanted to Moonwalk. Specifically, I want to master it and then wait for someone to ask me to go get something, whereupon I will say ""Sure, you got it!"" and will then proceed to Moonwalk for the next 15 minutes.
Other than that, though, I've never really had a hip-hop sort of persona. And I still don't. So when WDNY announced Anasma's Hip-hop Belly Dance fusion DVD, I was mostly ho-hum about it. Curious at best. I love belly dance pretty much as it is, and don't feel an overwhelming need to fuse it with anything. But Anasma, well, she's an amazing fusion herself - half Tunisian and Vietnamese, brought up in Paris, living in New York - and isn't shy of fusing whatever dance form catches her fancy.
When I began to watch her 2-disk DVD, I was very quickly amazed. Not only has Anasma been put together without bones, she's incredibly creative in the way she puts together elements of her dancing. The result is very compelling and now I find I really would love to learn all that's on her program. Though I'm probably well past the age for it, I've ignored that thought and started working with the two DVDs. I'm still not into hip-hop, I'm still not into theatrical dance, which is Anasma's forte, and I'm not into funky modern expression. All the same, I'd love to learn all the waving and gliding and floating that she's taught here.
Watch a bit of Anasma ""Aggressively Slow"" before we get into what's on the DVDs:
[youtube Ks0AtMT3AMI]
The instructional program begins with a 30-minute warm up and conditioning. It's the same difficulty level as a Suhaila style workout. Yoga and intense stretches. Very solid workout indeed.
So, the two DVD set is absolutely filled with content. Never-before content, at that. Logically but ingenuously, the first DVD focuses on belly dance and the second on hip-hop. But, neither of the two disks is ""pure"" one form or the other. Bellydancers who want nothing whatsoever to do with hip-hop will not find ""regular"" bellydance instruction on the first DVD. Anasma briefly describes a basic isolation or move and then goes into a drill with hip-hop stylization. For instance, you could be doing shoulder rolls and the drill would have you doing scoops with level changes and a shoulder see-saw. On the hip-hop DVD, you could be doing a Moonwalk, and the drill will have you layering a maya on that. The fusion is evident throughout the instructional program and is totally seamless.
As an instructor-on-video, Anasma comes across as very likeable and engaging. She's also exceedingly cool. She's encouraging, humorous, un-self-conscious. The instruction is clear though a little brief in places. She's full of analogies and explains concepts in more than one way, giving you the choice of picking a method that works best for you. She relates very well to the learner and in many places looks like she's in the middle of a conversation with you, almost stopping to get a response.
[youtube IAeINZD5KVw]
On the belly dance DVD, Anasma describes movements in terms of lines, circles, figure-8s and shimmies, making the path very clear. She goes through all the basic belly dance isolations briefly introducing each for review and a check on how she herself will use them before going on to the stylization. Movements for hips, chest, shoulders, head are all taken up. Also elbows because this is particularly important for arm waves. There are 9 short drills on disk 1 and you can make a longer drill section by accessing them in their own section.
The hip-hop DVD is when things get really interesting. You go through standing hip-hop moves of waving, liquid, popping, dimestepping and strobing, mannequin, tutting, glides and floating, and side floats. My favorites are the waving and liquid and the glides and floats and include the Moonwalk. The ones I don't like are the more robotic mime-like moves. That's the funky, theatrical side that I'm not into. Anasma aims this at belly dancers, so she explains it from concept upward.  The drills on this disk draw in some of what was learnt on disk 1. The drills are all combos rather than a single repeated movement. These are used in the choreography. In fact, the 11 drills here are much much longer than on disk 1 because they start building up for the choreography.
It's the tribal fusion side of me that loves this second whole part of the program. It's really quite challenging: you need to know your isolations and layering basics and be quite ready to put all that together with hip-hop.
Moving on to the choreography section, Anasma first tells you the story of the piece she's teaching. She also tells you the emotions and facial expressions that go with the choreography. I'm afraid I tend to gloss over this. There are separate choreography drills or practice sessions here; 9 of them. And a demonstration, of course. And finally, two breathtaking performances. One that use the movements taught: New Seed and a structured improvisation, Placebo, set to music by Pete List and Rob Mestrianni. I mean it when I say these performances are breathtaking - particularly the theatrical story-telling one: Placebo.
Anasma is completely boneless, that's for sure.",1239840000,23,5171,4.849547511312217
3657744,5,B001JGK4C8,"This DVD is so much FUN!!!!  Anasma does a great job of breaking down moves so that you can easily understand them, not to mention that she is just SO cute and a joy to watch!  I just love this video!  I'm recommending it to all my friends and students!  Since the contents were described in other reviews, I'll skip that part.  So my biggest piece of information for you is that this video will help you immensely if you think you are having trouble with fusion, and IT'S FUN! (Did I mention that?)",1239494400,,499,4.26595744680851
3657745,5,B001JGK4C8,"I had created my own style of hip hop belly dancing and when I saw Anasma's DVD coming out I had to have it.  Her style is different from my teachings and knowledge and is far better. I am really enjoying this DVD. She is very charming, encouraging, beautiful yound woman, an all around inspiration. This is the best DVD I have bought for belly dance! Even my bf is amazed!",1239235200,,373,4.253521126760563
3657746,5,B001JGK4C8,"... is this gem. A huge bargain to have four hours of instruction, drills and choreography for the price. Its definitely going to be a challenge for intermediate and up dancers (since some of the hip-hop movements will seem counter-intuitive to how bellydancers tend to move) but you will have a lot of fun working through each section at your own pace. If you insist on fusing your bellydance, then this is the principled approach to take. Anasmah is precise, fluid, charming and a patient instructor. She's made a fan of me and this double DVD set will keep me occupied for months to come.",1239062400,3,591,4.6380952380952385
3657747,5,B001JGK4C8,"Like the previous reviewers, I was very excited to get my DVD, and I was not disappointed.  There is an amazing amount of information in this two DVD set.  The warm-up is heavy on the stretching, which you will need to get your body ready for all of the constant movement she teaches.  Anasma does not repeat the drills over and over, but she does them more than enough for you to understand what she is doing, and then be able to practice them at length later. Because of this, she has packed a great number of drills into the two DVD's.  I agree that this might be a frustrating DVD for an absolute beginner, because she doesn't spend a great deal of time really disecting out the basic moves, so a basic knowledge of bellydance would be helpful.  Anasma does a great job of discussing spacial awareness of the body, and showing how basic movements can flow into the next.  This is really, in my opinion, the entire point of this DVD, and Anasma does not disappoint.  After going through the DVD's just one time I felt like I already had a better understanding of movement and flow.  Anasma's personality is light and bubbly, and really makes you feel like you are having fun and not drudging through a long boring set of drills.  I would highly recommend this DVD set to bellydancers of any style that want to work on the overall flow of their dance, as well as learn some really cool new moves!",1239062400,2,1398,4.408560311284047
3657748,5,B001JGK4C8,"This fantastic double dvd program is presented by WDNY. Anasma is your guide into this journey of merging belly dance with trendy fusions that include movements from ATS , borrowed from hip hop and blended into belly dance for a liquid fusion that is beautiful and modern.
First DVD: The belly dance technique section includes basic technique with a step up into the fusion of hip hop creating a transition from typical into modern and fluid.; ie: A chest circle with staccato shoulder rolls becomes a hip hop move, add level change add strobbing, and take it further!
To begin, get ready for the extensive yoga warm up focuses on hip and chest openers, side bends and torso rotations, plank series. It is a work out alone!
Technique in this section includes  drills with combo/partial choreography.
The first section on lines and loops focuses on: hips chest shoulders undulations in traditional and fusion style layered on traveling loops and circles.
The section on Circles is next and directed at: hips chest elbows, shoulders, head, and hips, done in traditional and fusion style.
Second DVD:
Technique and drills for the arms and hands to create "" liquid movement"", waving while layering on mayas . Next is a lesson on the popular ""Popping"" legs shoulders arms,  dime-stopping or probing and much more!
The delightful and at times giggly Anasma is knowledgeable and pleasant. Her dance is fluid and a beautiful blend of traditional and hip hop styles. These moves are seen often in ATS.
There is much to learn in the four hours of instruction. I simply cannot elaborate on all that is presented, and enjoyed this merge of dances. It  is intriguing!
The choreography is well broken down and repeated enough, however one must remember that time and practice create fluidity. Anasma says, it is patience that is required. Practice this fantastic program and it will not only smoothe out your moves but add prescence and awe to your dance.

I am enjoying this program while improving hand and arm articulation.
The performance section will prompt you to leave the couch and begin the program, so be prepared!",1238716800,3,2110,4.901960784313726
3657749,5,B001JGK4C8,"I was absolutely excited when I received my copy from the USA and I was not disappointed in any way. I did not know Anasma before but after watching the DVD and trying some sections I am really looking forward to learning the choreography and enhancing my dacing with some Hip Hop moves (which is usually a no go for me musicwise).

The content of the DVDs is described above so I will not mention it again.

I especially enjoy Anasmas little jokes in between and her openhearted behaviour ...and of course her amazing ability to flow around the room. She explains movements with good examples and shows them in an appropriate speed.
The choreography is an absolute joy to watch and is really heating up my ambition. The music matches it perfectly. Cant wait to get my hands on the song.

Another thing i find very useful is that Anasma is showing a move and then giving varieties of it- apart from the combo she is using in the choreo.

I will have a lot of fun with this DVD set and I will learn a great deal. I would recommend it to anyone who likes her style without any reserve. I would still say though it is not a DVD for absolute beginners due to the complexity of some movements and the layering involved. I would probably classify myself as an intermediate student.
Thanks, Anasma! :D

Sorry for spelling and grammar errors...I am no native speaker ;)",1238112000,19,1361,4.449799196787149
3657750,5,B001JGK4C8,"Anasma's creativity in this blend of classic belly dance and hip hop is a marvel, and her strength, fluidity and consummate grace as a dancer make this DVD all the more enjoyable to watch and to learn from. The final performances are fabulous, with the storytelling element of hip hop making the 2 pieces expressive and interesting.  First is a choreographed  one titled ""New Seed,"" and the 2nd, ""Placebo,"" is a ""Structured Improvisation,"" and is performed twice so that we can see how the same story can be told with variations.

In this 260 minute 2 disc set, the first disc is devoted to a Welcome which is an overview as well as an introduction to Anasma, who is currently based in New York City, and is a beautiful and petit dancer of Tunisian and Vietnamese extraction, brought up in Paris, with a hybrid accent that knows no boundaries.  Anasma describes belly dancing as being internal and hip hop as being external energy.

Disc 1 continues with a thorough warm-up, and basic belly dance moves, starting easy and getting harder, with many drills to practice with, and showing how these movements transition into hip hop. Disc 2  concentrates on the hip hop movements, again with many drills, the choreographed piece, ""New Seed,"" which is broken down into sections for learning, and the performances. Music is primarily by Pete List and Rob Mastrianni, and is delightful. Innovative and exciting, Anasma's dance expertise makes  learning this belly dance hip hop fusion a joy!",1237766400,,1484,4.888446215139442

3657757,5,B001JGK4C8,"Okay, I admit it... I love dubstep. And I love the new fusion of belly dance and hip hop which is often performed to dubstep music. When I saw this video I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. Fortunately the DVD publisher, World Dance New York, was willing to send me one to review for free. It's probably one of the coolest fusion videos I've seen... ever! Seriously.

THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD: is the program itself. Anasma has created something that is uniquely a true synthesis of two styles. Every move is at the same time both belly dance and hip hop. The fusion carries through to her costuming, music, and her expressions, as well. It's modern and fresh but still true to the origins of both forms. If you're familiar with Anasma's work, you know that this is her specialty. It's also pretty rare. I often see the label of ""fusion"" describe routines that are just non-traditional. The dancer picks and chooses moves from different genres, but there is no true blending. You definitely won't find that here.

OTHER THINGS I LIKED:

- There's a lot of content- two disks and over four hours worth of content. You get an explanation and drill set for both the belly dance and the hip hop moves, plus a choreography, and some performance footage.
- The belly dance drills are good enough to stand alone. You could pick up a few nice combinations even if you never use the hip hop section.
- The choreography is really cute! It's a wonderful synthesis of the information that's covered and good enough to be performed at a fusion themed venue.
- The DVD production values are very good. The lighting and videography are appropriate, and it's easy to find what you need through the DVD menus.

BE WARNED: Although it's not clearly stated in the description, this DVD is probably best suited for intermediate and advanced level dancers. You will need a good understanding of the mechanics of movement, from either a background in belly dancing or hip hop, for the choreography. There's really only enough time for Anasma to breeze through the breakdown of each movement, and not enough explanation is given for beginning dancers.

TO SUMMARIZE: This is a wonderful resource for experienced dancers interested in expanding their realm of experience across different genres. Even if you're not interested specifically in hip hop, there's a valuable lesson here as to what a true fusion of styles looks and feels like. The quality of the content and the instruction is excellent.",1349654400,,2484,4.714285714285714

(rachel brice's dvd is also advanced, but straight up more about the technical than the sexual creative life dance thing world dance new york seems to be about now. it's probably a cultural thing: dancing caucasians in general seem to be ecstatic just to finally feel free to MOVE and tell everyone else how like they just discovered america [yet again], while other cultures already know about how to move more freely--particularly in a lifetime of constricting situations--so they're often already well into the spiritual as well as the pragmatic realm in all the arts and plain life and philosophy--be it music, painting, dance, etc.)

keep an eye on world dance new york's output. they're onto something that's beyond dancing around in front of your tv on a suburban shag carpet.

there's something revolutionary and sexy and alive and many colors... i love all their uses of the word ""fusion.""
they live it. and to live it, you've gotta get along.

Best things: it's great for working on fluidity and precision (many undulations get passed all around the body); there's so much material, much of it new to me; she has a systematic way of presenting moves that also helps you see how to develop variations on other moves you already know; adorable outfits (bellydance has so much awful costuming); she's warm, engaging, and encouraging; and her dancing is inspiring. It's true that she moves quickly, but there is far more breakdown/instruction than in Fayzah's Fluid Tribal. There are parts of this I couldn't follow at all at first that now I can--as with much of bellydance, a tolerance of frustration early on is helpful. This is a DVD that an intermediate dancer could really grow with. Prior interest in hip-hop is not necessary; this would be great fun for any tribal fusion dancer, or anyone with background in bellydance or hip-hop who enjoys learning new ways of moving.",1266019200,4,1041,4.725274725274725

I purchased Elisheva Pop & Lock (also from World Dance NY) as a companion dvd b/c it simplifies some of Anasma's material.

This DVD is awesome, if you are willing to put the time in, and have the background knowledge necessary to WORK IT! I would definitely recommend a grounding in either Bellydance or Hip Hop movements and isolations prior to using this DVD.

Other reviews go into more detail about the content. Suffice to say that there is a lot of it there, and much of it was new and exciting for me. I am still working through the sections in detail, and will continue to repeat parts I'm still getting the hang of until I'm happy with how the movement looks on my body. But so far, so good!

As an instructor, Anasma is charming, quirky and expressive. She has boundless energy and a very cute accent (which includes some frenchisisms in her speech!) She does sometimes bumble in her explanations, but if you're not a newbie to dance, then you can go with the flow and just follow along without any trouble. I found her personality addictively inspiring. Made me want to watch more and do better.

However, I don't use it as often as other DVDs because there is so much that I cannot focus. I like something that I can work on and challenge myself, intense, sharp and hard, so after a few months, my everything improves and then I will move on to other DVDs.

Anasma seamlessly combines two very different styles of dancing in a way that is easy to understand and learn. Whether your style is more for bellydancing or hip hop, Anasma shows you how to approach the other one. Her methods are fluid, graceful, and beautiful and she explains how you can make yours the same. Just watching the demonstrations makes you feel like you can do whatever she can, but the intricacies of the choreography don't leave you bored too quickly. The drills are quick enough to do a few daily and the menu makes it easy to customize your learning process. The dvd is professional, simple, and well laid out. It takes a little imagination to adapt this style to club use or anything besides performance, but the effort is well worth it.

There is very little explanation of how to do some of the movements, in particular, when she starts combining things in drills.  In one case she tells the viewer to do one type of circle immediately followed by a different type.  That's the extent of ""instruction"" for this.  She never does it in slow motion nor explains which piece of each circle to start with so that the circles will flow together.  I had to rewatch the section several times at quarter-speed to pick up what she was doing.

When she does explain, she explains only once and then goes immediately into full speed - no slow or intermediate speed practice here!  The combinations are repeated just a few times.  A bigger problem though is she does not keep her timing consistent.  In one drill, she says to pause on 7 and 8, but half the time while drilling, she will start stepping on 7 and 8!  In another drill, she does half of it at the speed she says at the start, but in the second half, she speeds up.  By the end of the drill, she had sped her way up until she was ending each repetition by count 4, not count 8.  When I first watched the video, I thought I was insane because I could do the drills just fine sometimes, and other times I was horrible.  Now I know, and I don't watch her while I drill, I just count to myself, and I do MUCH better.

I'm also not a big fan of the warmup as a warmup.  There is a lot of stretching and I feel nervous doing that much stretching without more warmup.  It might be good as a cooldown or post-workout stretch session, though.

Despite these problems, this DVD set is not a total loss.  There is a TON of creativity in here!  I love her fusion between hip hop and bellydance, and I love the new techniques and moves that I am learning.  Most of this DVD's problems are easily solved (you can pause it to practice drills longer or at a slower speed, bad timing can be ignored) and even the harder problems can be kind of fixed with the power of the rewind and slo-mo buttons.  I do not regret buying this DVD and will be keeping it as a permanent, valuable part of my collection.  Still, I am disappointed since it seems most of these problems could have been easily fixed before it was released.",1243555200,54,2467,4.29004329004329
3657775,5,B001JGK4C8,"I own two Bellydance superstars tribal fusion instructional dvd's and was very disappointed, they are short and offer little choreography. The Bellydance dvd's from world dance newyork are by far the best. Like Ashara and Ariellah's tribal fusion instructional dvd, Hip Hop liquid is long, 4 hours and 20 min, to be exact. Anasma explains every move with great detail and it is very fun to do.",1243296000,2,393,4.880597014925373
3657776,5,B001JGK4C8,"I strongly recommend purchasing Bellydance Hip Hop Liquid Fusion by Anasma. The instruction is world class, sensible, accessable while still being detailed. The photography and production is great with close ups right where they need to be and all the right angles and repetitions to see what you need. The music is complimentary and compelling. It's a two DVD set of over four hours collectively with sections on Bellydance, hip hop and then a choreography.

Even if you are not interested in hip hop or liquid or even fusion the bellydance section (the entire first DVD) is absolutely solid and packed with plane, line and shape visualizations that could enhance any bellydancer's form and excecution. The second DVD contains the Hip Hop techniques choreography breakdown, demonstration with and without sectional instruction and performance. I especially liked that she explained the story aspect of her choreography, and introduced the idea of a structured improvisation. Anasma is supremely knowledgeable and playful, and I found this DVD both hard work and tremendous fun.  This is the equivalent of a page turner, so you may want to set aside a block of time to indulge in a start to finish workshop type experience; but if you prefer the introduce-learn-master-move on approach with breaks for repetition and internalizing everything is easily accessable through the well designed menu .

As a bellydance teacher of many years my students often ask which DVD they should get for at home practice and though I could recommend this or that DVD for a great special focus I would always have to give a caveat about something or another instruction method or distracting element to the production. I am pleased and excited to say this is the first DVD I can recommend wholeheartedly not just to help daily practice but to use as a long term tool to perfect and inspire new personal motion and dance stylings.",1243209600,9,1911,5.022082018927445

3657780,5,B001JGK4C8,This one is a excellent dvd for fusion dancers. Hip hop dances are similiar to the moves done in fusion dancing. You also learn the good technigues for your arms. The warm up is great. I kept it for that alone. good stretching. Good for learning how to travel and layering. Lost of undulations practiced. She makes learning it fun. Just trying to combine the moves with hip hop is fun all by itself. You use figure 8's and you get to practice foot work in this dvd. Great body conditioning. I must say it is a good price for all you are getting. I guess you have to buy it to appreciate it.,1240099200,4,590,4.184210526315789
