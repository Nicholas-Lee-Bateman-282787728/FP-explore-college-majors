6879775,5,B00QT4VBNG,What a season! Go Bucks!,1424908800,,24,4.0
6879776,5,B00QT4VBNG,Very pleased,1424822400,,12,5.5
6879777,5,B00QT4VBNG,Great Blu-ray and DVD Package to own the game.,1424736000,,46,4.222222222222222
6879778,1,B00QT4VBNG,Ugh. Huge error in naming this product. It is NOT the BCS National Championship. BCS died a well overdue death last year. Get it right.,1423526400,3,135,4.44
6879779,5,B00QT4VBNG,"Here's the revised review after picking up the discs.  Awesome, just awesome.  What a year for the Buckeye's.  I was at the game in Dallas, but I set it to record at home so I could watch it again (and again).  Unfortunately, due to power outage, about 30 min of the game wasn't recorded.  So, I figured I would get the DVD.  So basically it's got the commercial free game and the trophy presentation.  This is the real deal (no longer concerns about authenticity due to the initial product naming mistake by Amazon).  Glad Amazon fixed the error in the title (which previously read BCS championship).  Enjoy it!  Hopefully we'll be back for 2016

LEAVING MY OLD REVIEW BELOW:

The title of this product is incorrect (I'm sure the product is great and the error is just a minor detail).  This was the CFP National Championship.  If it were still the BCS era (thank god it's not), we likely would have had a BAMA logo (as they would have crushed FSU) and OSU and Oregon would have been left out of the picture.  Sooooo glad it was NOT the BCS National Championship Game.  Go Bucks.

O-H

Based on the comments left, I think I need to clarify this review.  I am pointing out the title discrepancy as a warning regarding authenticity.  Also, I only dropped stars on this as a warning regarding authenticity.  If anyone can confirm this is an authentic/valid product after they ship, please do let us know.  I will be happy to edit the review entirely.",1422489600,12,1448,4.5096525096525095
6879780,5,B00QT4VBNG,"The exclamation point on the most improbable season in the history of college football.  If a screenwriter tried to pitch it to a movie producer, the response would be, ""I get it it, kid.  EVERYBODY loves a great 'cinderella' sports story! But it's got to be somewhat plausible! This is just too far out for anyone to buy into.

""You want people to go see a movie about a college team that loses one of the country's best quarterbacks ten days before the start of the season.  His backup, who never started a game, replaces him and becomes a Heisman Trophy finalist by breaking conference records... including the most touchdown passes in a season.

""Then he breaks HIS ankle...?  And the THIRD string quarterback has to start HIS first game, which happens to be the conference championship game, against the no. 4 defense in the entire country.  And he leads his team to a 59-0 rout?

""If that isn't ridiculous enough, he then leads them to victory against the NUMBER ONE TEAM IN THE COUNTRY?

""And after that, he leads them to victory AGAIN, and they become NATIONAL CHAMPIONS???

""Have you considered trying your hand at SCIENCE fiction?  Because your sports fiction is just WAY too out there.""",1421625600,59,1197,4.706730769230769

6879809,5,B00QT4VBNG,"One of the best underdog stories in recent college football history. 3rd String QB Cardale Jones completes the unbelievable 3-game sweep of Wisconsin, Alabama and then finally Oregon to win the National Title.

But truth be told, this was Elliott's statement game. Many were questioning whether what he did vs Alabama was a fluke, and then he left no doubt. Nearly carried the Buckeyes on his back for most of the game.",1437782400,,419,4.819444444444445

6879817,5,B00QT4VBNG,"The DVD is a must for all Ohio State fans!!  It is a treasure to ""relive"" this Championship game whenever you want on this DVD as OSU works their way to the National Championship over Alabama and Oregon.  Remember most of the ""pundants"" all said that OSU did not even belong in the same mix as the rest. Certainly the season started terribly as their Heisman finalist Miller went down weeks before the season started; then their Freshman second string Quarterback Barrett aptly lead OSU (setting school records) through the season, only the break his foot in the final game of the season.  Ohio State's third string quarterback Jones then proceeded to lead Ohio to the Big Ten Championship, a victory over powerhouse Alabama, and a National Championship win over Oregon!  Running back Elliott helping along the way with amazing runs. It was a great season; it was especially meaningful with all the trash talk about the Big Ten being too big and no match for the SEC or the Pack 12.  Oh well, Ohio State with its 3rd string quarterback was pretty impressive too.  This is a great gift for Ohio State and Big 10 fans alike.",1434326400,3,1122,4.641414141414141

The actual televised version had one of the best pregame shows we've seen: the music, the shots of the players, the National Anthem, the whole works. This has nothing but the game.",1425686400,11,244,4.568181818181818
6879890,1,B00QT4VBNG,This is my first Amazon review. I'm giving this a 1 because my team lost.,1425686400,,73,3.933333333333333

6879893,4,B00QT4VBNG,"My only complaint is.... Where is the pre-game talking heads ?? If the end goal is to have a piece of history if you are a fan... where are all the bells and whistles that complete the game??? I want to watch over and over again all those that stated ""The Ohio State Buckeyes couldn't do it... and then at the end I want to watch them all eat their words... How could you deny me or any Buckeye fan the satisfaction of seeing these for the rest of our lives?? That would make it 5 Stars",1425427200,18,486,4.020618556701031
6879894,5,B00QT4VBNG,I purchased this disc and the Sugar Bowl blu ray. It's exactly how I wanted it to be edited(without the talking heads on ESPN at halftime)and the camera shots are flawless. The blu ray picture quality is superb. The sound is also very good. For under $15 this is a steal as I paid more for the last OSU championship DVD which had a crappy DVD picture. I wish they would offer a blu ray for the Big Ten Championship game and a season highlights disc.,1425340800,5,449,4.232558139534884

6879897,5,B00QT4VBNG,Everything about this is amazing. The clarity of the screen and the removal of the ticker across the bottom makes this a must buy. No commercials but not a shortened version of the game either. It has the AT&T logo in the upper left corner and the scorecard in the lower right. Everything else has been removed for your viewing pleasure. I'll be buying a few more as gifts for others.,1425081600,7,384,4.422535211267606
6879898,5,B00QT4VBNG,The video quality of this is spectacular and as a hard core Buckeye fan this is an absolute must have to any Buckeye fans collection. Go Bucks!!,1424995200,2,144,4.37037037037037

8692871,5,B00QT4VBNG,"As others have said, I wish this featured more pre-game material. Other than that, the picture and sound are very clear. I get great satisfaction watching Zeke and Cardale bulldoze the Oregon defense over and over again :)",1501372800,,222,4.868421052631579

8692875,5,B00QT4VBNG,Got this as a gift for my dad since he's a big fan. The picture quality is unbelievable. I think it's better than a lot of movies I have on blu-ray. Would absolutely buy this again for other games.,1475539200,,197,4.076923076923077

8692877,5,B00QT4VBNG,"After walloping Wisconsin with a third string quarterback, decisively man handle the nations 'top rated' team, it was all too easy in defeating the Ducks,(again), in the first championship game of the playoff era. The Buckeyes dominated and shut down the Oregon offense as no team has been able to do, ( like they did a few years ago too). And continued to have success with their third string quarterback and running game. A great game to watch before the Alabama game, (that was the real championship game in my heart and mind), that ended a dream season for our men in Scarlett and Grey. This will always have a top spot in my collection, and I will pass it on to my son, and future generations. Great game.",1465689600,,710,4.511627906976744
