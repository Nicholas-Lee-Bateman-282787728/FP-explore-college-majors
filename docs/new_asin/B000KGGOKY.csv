8156419,2,B000KGGOKY,"The video's not bad for what it is, but it is just 22.5 minutes including opening and closing credits. Nowhere in the product description is there an indication that the video is so short. A Rick Steves episode is much more informative in just a little more time. Basically we get Samantha being cute on a train, Samantha showing her hotel room, Samantha eating lunch, Samantha uninterested in the Prado, Samantha talking about Paella, and Samantha eating tapas. There are some Madrid sights, but not enough to get much of a sense of what the city is like or why one might want to visit.

Note the promo text in the description above, which also appears on the back cover of the DVD case: ""The nightlife in Madrid is something to experience, and Samantha joins in the fun and festivities when the sun goes down. She'll ""hop on"" the public transportation and stay at a hotel designed by a world-renowned theatre designer.""
1) They show no festivities, just one tapas bar and one hot chocolate.
2) We never see her on public transportation.
3) We do get a short view of her hotel room, but she never mentions the designer.",1265328000,2,1120,4.6

A great DVD to add to the Travel section of my DVD collection.",1265328000,,269,4.604166666666667
