Very few redeeming qualities to this one for me, aside for the fact that eventually it did end.  Ive noticed in the past I tend to like movies that others do not really like, so when I don't like a movie something must really be awry. I was heartened to see others are not exactly waiving the flag of support for this one.  It appears to be as popular as brake-lights on the expressway.

  Someone described this as a spoof of horror movies. I don't know if that is necessarily the case...there were really no elements of humor at all and most spoofs poke fun with a tinge of humor. None of the characters were lovable, in fact by the end I was hoping the killer would not only kill them all, but he would then kill himself, and no one would be left. Ive found that horror spoofs usually involve laughs (none) and scantily clad women. None of those either, but there was a baffling scene early in the movie of a guy in the shower set to music, and I even think it was in slow motion. And there was a bare butt on camera for a few, but again, it was a man.

  Some find Joe Estevez terrible, and others find him so over the top he is good. File me into the first category. In fact I am going to scour my wishlist and watchlist for any signs of him in any other movies I planned on watching, and if he shows up in the cast I am deleting the movie.  In fact there is not one person involved in this product that I ever want to encounter again.

  I am glad that the back cover of the movie explained that the killer was escaped from a mental hospital cause this was never explained in the film. Then again explaining anything means people are curious as to how it happened. The only thing I was wondering as the credits rolled was how this was made.

  I went with this cause I enjoy the grand game of baseball. There are a number of things I can nitpick in that regard (as in the announcers inexplicably going to a commercial break in the middle of an inning as a player needed to return to the dugout for something) but thats a waste of everyones time. The second I noticed a pitching machine was in the movie I figured it would be used as a killing tool and, yup. There were a couple of baseball-themed deaths with the baseball bat getting most of the screen time.

  Lastly, I understand that minor league Stadiums like this are big, but with all the walking around people were doing through endless hallways without stumbling upon one another it appeared more like the alleys of one of the larger cities of North America.  Now that I think of it 20% of the movie was people walking around the innards of the Stadium. So if you give this a go do it with a finger on the fast-forward button.  Not only will the characters appear more endearing and amusing moving really fast, but the movie will be over quicker.  And why was everyone sticking around the Stadium for so long after the game anyway?  I understand some tasks need to be done, but not what most of these people were all doing. So, when you really think about it, they were asking for it.

  The back cover of the DVD says, ""Three strikes...You're Dead!""  I counter that this movie should be postponed on account of Pain.",1367452800,,3271,4.26948051948052
7956510,1,B00005Y70D,"David Heavener who plays the suspected killer in THE CATCHER has come through many Z movies, like Twisted Justice, Fugitive X, etc., to this ridiculously horrible horror film without scars.  But after this one, well, he may just have to retire.

Monique Parent is awful in the role of the baseball's bigwig something or other and all she does most of the movie is parade around with her clipboard looking at all the doors.  The director must have liked her butt, cause that's about all he throws at us for a good while.  There's one shot in the locker room that shows about eight catcher's masks...how many catchers does this team have?  They never mention in the movie that the psychotic dad killer even escaped or got out..they want us to think it's Heavener.  The deaths are fairly gory, especially the up the you know what baseball bat.  There's some cowardly little janitor who stumbles around like Igor.  There is little if any suspense and the ending is outrageously bad.  And as for Joe Estevez, I don't know how he missed out on the talent the rest of the family has, but here once again he screams, shouts and offers no inference of characterization at all.

Lame and lethargic, this is one catch you don't want to make!",1095033600,,1230,4.60091743119266
7956511,1,B00005Y70D,"This movie was just plain bad.  It took two sittings to watch it as it literally put me to sleep.  The script and direction are horrible, and the actors have zero energy, except for Joe Estevez, who tries really hard to inject some life into this dud.  It's not even enjoyable in that bad movie kind of way.  And Monique Parent keeps her clothes one throughout the entire movie.  No T&A in this one.  Save your time and money.  My DVD was full of glitches as well, lots of digital artifacts and it freezes up during the credit sequence, which might actually be a good thing for those crew members whose names we don't see!",1062288000,,622,4.356521739130435
