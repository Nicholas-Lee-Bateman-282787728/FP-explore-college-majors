2258511,1,B0008ENIPC,"There's bad, and then there's so bad that all I want to mention is that someone has a huge collection of Fangoria at home and used every one of the cheap makeup ideas in this one, including the one about filling a balloon with grape jelly, putting a mask on it, and bashing it with a 2x4 to make it look like a zombie head explosion.  Not even fun, just badly done.

I had more fun making Tazmanian Cheese Devils. Take a hot dog, put it in your mouth, chew it up. Now spray ketchup all over your face. Now spit it out, screaming ""Ma dhug, ma dhug!""",1138147200,2,548,4.064814814814815
2258512,1,B0008ENIPC,"This is about some kids that go to a supposedly haunted house where a low budget horror movie is being filmed.  At the same time, some grave robbers dig up a corpse in a nearby cemetery in order to steal a valuable amulet.  This causes all the bodies in the cemetery to come to life, the grave robbers run to the house the kids are in, and everybody runs around frantically until the end.

I really wasn't expecting much when I got this;  it looked like an extremely low budget haunted house / zombie movie.  I was prepared for the usual bad acting, bad writing, and ridiculous plot.  What I wasn't prepared for was the utterly amateurish camerawork - you can literally get seasick watching this thing.  I believe it was filmed by a guy who drank a pint of Jack Daniels, sprained his ankle, and then picked up a handheld video camera and staggered and stumbled around for the entire duration of the production.  And let's not forget the sound either.  While it's not uncommon to be unable to hear what the characters are saying because the microphone was too far away, you do get the sound of their footsteps loud and clear (through the rear speakers for some reason).  And then there's the whole comedy angle the thing goes for - when the zombies attack, we're treated to a nu-metal soundtrack blasting through the speakers, complete with that silly cookie monster singing.  There are a lot more attempts at comedy, they all fall entirely flat.

Now, I could probably live through all this, but it has to go even further.  Almost all the characters spend the last half of the movie screaming frantically at each other.  Oh boy, is this ever a joy to sit through.  The only two characters who don't engage in this festival of supreme annoyance are one of the grave robbers, who sits in a chair making deadpan comments and ordering people around, and the blond girl, who is the only one to keep a cool head.  She's the only likable character in the whole movie.

The single redeeming quality about this mess is a long make-out scene between a girl in pink underwear and her boyfriend.  Those pink undies are really the star of the movie.",1128124800,9,2136,4.532637075718016
2258513,1,B0008ENIPC,"After twenty or so minutes into this zombiefest, I gave up.  THE WICKEDS is a really abysmal entry in the zombie field, with horrible production values and acting.  What more can I say?",1127088000,,185,4.575757575757576
2258514,3,B0008ENIPC,"I never knew this was a Zombie film till I saw a teaser on a movie i rented. This movie at best is mediocre, with basically the same exact plot as Night of the Living Dead. Except in this case a couple of grave robbers steal an amulet of a buried vampire and with that he awaked the Vampire and  form then on all the dead rise to take revenge on the ones who disturbed there sleep then they run to the only house around where they run into a couple of kids that went to this haunted house for Halloween now they are stuck there with Zom,bies every where and you guesed they bored up all the windows etc...

So overall the acting is Mediocre, not good not bad sometimes over dramatic but it is a low budget flick with the best actor being Jake the lead guy. The make up effects are also quit good as are any of the violent scenes, no CGI, all make up effects which is awesome. they did a very good job with the Zombie makeup like I said for a low budget but a good example of there Zombies are close in resembling Zombies from movies such as Dead Next Door and Stink of flesh, which is quit good some have great make up some are just basically blue-ish grey with blood on them.

The plot is very much a bite off of N.O.T.L.D but throws in its own twist of ghosts and Vampires that actually works very well, the makeup on the lead Vampire is also very good. Overall this is a movie worth the rent for all you Zombie fans to buy  I don't know at $13 is pretty cheap, and this movie was not bad at all there was Gore which is always good and there was a decent amount of it. So Im still stcuk deciding if I will buy it or not just check it out for your self a overall good movie worth a rent then its up to you to decide if you will purchase it. If I want to watch a movie similar to The Wicked I will just watch the great Night Of the Living Dead. But this movie is still nice to have , it would fit nice with my collection of b-Zombie movies, but im in no rush it will always be around.",1124323200,2,1984,3.927860696517413

8055900,3,B0008ENIPC,"Not a movie you cancel your plans to stay home and watch. But they kept bad language to a minimum and people kept their clothes on, which I appreciate.",1453852800,,151,4.241379310344827
8055901,3,B0008ENIPC,"I was actually looking for a movie called The Wicked but came across this 1 & thought why not give it a try. Anytime I see a normal movie with Ron Jeremy in it, I won't watch it because every single normal movie I've watched with him in it has just straight up sucked so I have no idea what made me decide to give this movie a chance but I did. Anyways, I LOVE Horror flicks, I LOVE BAD movies & The Wickeds was both. I stuck it through, Made it to the end & I enjoyed the movie. It's nothing I'd watch again, rent or buy but if you LOVE Horror flicks & BAD movies like I do then give it a watch (Maybe it was SO BAD, it was good?)",1423785600,,631,3.7518796992481205
8055902,3,B0008ENIPC,"Any horror movie with Ron Jeremy, you can expect it to be a total cheesefest.  It is ok.  It is B-horror and you can tell by the acting and cinematography. Only reason I gave it 3 stars was because half the movie keeps going back and forth to this couple going at it.  She is extremely hot.  They just don't show her naked though which for this type of movie is disappointing.

Overall a fun little slasher flick as long as you aren't expecting this to be anything more than a B-Horror.",1377648000,,486,4.239130434782608
8055903,1,B0008ENIPC,"Just having to look at Ron Jeremy is bad enough on its own (although, thankfully, he stays fully clothed here), but even the prospect of seeing his character savagely killed does nothing to ease the pain of watching a movie this pathetic and abysmal.  The Wickeds is a film that even the director couldn't possibly love.  There's not even any female nudity to help get you through it - although, quite frankly, I wouldn't particularly like to see any of these actresses nude, anyway.  The lack of nudity is confusing, though, because everything else about this film conveys the impression that it was written and filmed by a twelve-year-old boy.  Sure, there's plenty of gore, but it's horribly fake and unconvincing.  And the acting?  Well, Ron Jeremy is by far the most talented actor involved in this project - need I say more?

There is barely even a story underlying all of this cinematic torture.  Seven incredibly annoying, unattractive young people break into this old spooky house where a low-budget horror film is being shot.  Unbeknownst to them, Gus (Ron Jeremy) and his gimboid sidekick are at the nearby cemetery digging up a corpse in order to steal an amulet from the body.  Naturally, the theft of this horrible piece of cosmetic jewelry brings all of the dead bodies out of their graves, and their pursuit of human flesh eventually brings both groups together inside the house.  Will any of the characters survive?  Who smegging cares?

Despite the fact that these are clearly zombies doing everything that zombies do, the characters keep referring to them as vampires, which tells you something about the group intelligence on display here.  That's just one of the many, many ways this film annoyed me.  I watch a lot of bad movies - some of them are true gems worthy of cult status; most of them are just forgettable; but a few of them should be considered forms of torture.  The Wickeds clearly falls into that final category.",1375660800,3,1947,4.801801801801802
8055904,5,B0008ENIPC,"I think alot of the other reviewers of this film were expecting way too much and when they actually saw it, tried to review it with a serious -movie-template in mind, and not using the bad-b-movie-template to watch it. The movie does not take itself serious, so why would you think it was a serious entry into the horror genre?

It's the Dollar Days at Kmart type film. The kids are supposedly going to a horror movie set to party for the weekend. What horror movie have you ever seen that uses store bought Halloween decorations and props? Even the zombie make up is that white clown face paint grease stuff.

The acting is bad. It's not Oscar type acting, it's more bad porn type acting...oh wait! Porn legend Ron ""Creepy"" Jeremy is starring in this! But this type of acting for this type of movie works! It's all high school drama class type acting...with alot of over wrought crying and squealing.

As for the editing...there are LOADS of mistakes, but the producers don't care! It adds to the fun of the film to pick mistakes out. There is a make out scene in a bedroom in the house...but from camera shot to camera shot, the couple seem to be taking clothes off and putting them back on. One shot the guy has his jeans on...the next he has them off, the next they are back on. In another scene, a zombie breaks into the house, a girl runs out of the house...and the camera followers her for a distance as she runs screaming...but meanwhile back at the house the cut to the kids jumping the zombie in the house...but in the back ground you see the girl running back out the door....again!

This movie was made to be just enjoyed for it's rotteness. It doesn't take itself serious, it's all done knowing it's not a classic, it's just a bad b-movie...and that's what makes it a GOOD b-movie!",1252800000,3,1794,4.443768996960486
8055905,2,B0008ENIPC,"For lovers of campy b-movies, this flick rates a 2.5 (rounded down to 2) and might be worth a watch just for grins and giggles. For pretty much anyone else, this movie barely rates a 1.

Seven local teenagers decide to spend Halloween night inside a deserted house with a ""history"".  They don't seem to actually know the history, just that it's supposed to be haunted.  Just to be a ""little"" different than the norm, this same house is also being used to film a horror movie.  We never see any of the production crew, cameras, or actors, (who evidently don't work on weekends) but there are lots of movie props lying around for the teenagers to use on each other, trip over, accidentally pick-up when they need a real weapon to save themselves, etc..  In many ways, this is where the movie went wrong.  If the actors/crew who were filming the ""fake"" horror movie had wandered on screen to share time (and get killed) with the local teenagers . . . you would at least have had a more original movie.  Maybe not any better, but at least a little different.

Instead, the local teenagers are joined by two grave robbers (one of whom is played by Ron Jeremy) who are being pursued by a horde of zombies.  (The grave robbers stole an amulet from the grave of an undead evil high priest . . . don't ask.)  There's lots of conflict between the two groups inside the house and even more between the humans and the zombies.

The writers of this piece of fluff do get credit for trying.  There are some cute lines and at least an effort is made to be funny and clever.  However, not only do many of the lines fall flat, some are just God awful.  For example, at one point two brothers decide that they are going to make a mad dash through the hordes of zombies, never mind why. One brother turns to his girlfriend and says, ""My brother was the best defensive player on the team.  It will be just like football.  He'll run the defense and I'll run the offense.""  I can forgive the lame special effects.  I can forgive the tired plot (how many times have we seen a group of people trapped in a house and attacked by zombies?).  This bit of dialogue, along with several others, is just unforgivable.

If you are a big fan of zombie movies or of low budget horror/comedies, this one is worth a watch (but only a watch, this is a definite rental), otherwise steer clear.",1207440000,,2355,4.370114942528736
8055906,1,B0008ENIPC,"This movie is very confused, the makers aren't sure if they wanted a zombie film, or a vampire film.

Young group goes to an 'abandoned house' (where have you heard that one before) that used to be used to make horror films. They're near a grave-yard.

The dead come back to life in order to recover a pendant. The walking dead are zombie-like, except part way through the film when one of the teens is bitten, she's able to speak. And one, only one has fangs.

This same woman is there for the 'sex' appeal, only she continually covers her nipples. And, when she's frightened by a zombie/vampire, runs downstairs having somehow found the time to find her bra and put it back on - so frightened is she!",1158105600,,702,4.426356589147287
8055907,1,B0008ENIPC,"I have to agree with other comments about the low-budget, no-talent quality of this, er, film. I am surprised that 5 people bothered to review it. Perhaps like me they were angry about wasting their time. Some of the zombie/vampire make-up is good, but overall it's a painfully lame production. Also I am puzzled by the fellow who commented on one actress's pink underwear. Was he watching a foreign edition or something? Her shirt was pink, but her bra and panties were white. Let's strive for accuracy in our reviews, people!",1143244800,2,527,4.802197802197802
8055908,4,B0008ENIPC,"This movie wasen't quit what I thought it would be. But, it wasen't that bad. Sure the acting was bad and the special effects weren't the greatest. It was a low budget movie! I still enjoyed it. I have seen worse.",1138492800,2,213,4.219512195121951
