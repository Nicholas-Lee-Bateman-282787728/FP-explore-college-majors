5256535,4,B0093SSACK,"So similar to ""Rear Window"" by Hitchcock. There are enough differences to make it stand alone though. Personally, I like the cast better. George Sanders as the man that Barbara Stanwyck sees murder someone across the alley and Gary Merrill as the cop who wants to believe her but has no proof. She tries all kind of ways to get some kind of proof but George Sanders counters her at every turn. Very cool old movie with terrific performances. I won't ruin anything more but to say what a great movie this was.",1419984000,10,508,4.473118279569892
5256536,4,B0093SSACK,"In a persecution role similar but not equal to the role Stanwyck played in ""Sorry, Wrong, Number"", she is what saves this film, which does have some merit.  The plot is almost totally implausible with an unbelievable ending but Stanwyck makes it worthwhile.  Her voice is somewhat deeper (probably due to her chain-smoking habit) than usual which counter-balances her victimized character.  As others have mentioned, this film has been shot ""noirishly"" with dark hues and shadows.

The acting is great which compensates for the far-fetched plot.  Stanwyck can always be counted on for a doozy of a performance as she always brings average or below-average material up to her first-class level.  This film is average, but fun to watch and amazingly, gets better with each viewing.  Worth a look and for those who collect Stanwyck films, this will not be a disappointment!",1418169600,12,870,5.084507042253521
5256537,4,B0093SSACK,"Witness to Murder is a film noir with a weak plot that is saved by performances from screen veterans Barbara Stanwyck and George Sanders and dark atmosphere provided by famous film noir cinematographer John Alton.

Instead of a femme fatale, the antagonist is a male played by George Sanders, and the protagonist is a female played by Stanwyck. Stanwyck witnesses Sanders kill a girlfriend from her window. She calls the police, and they find no body, no murder weapon and no evidence that a murder was committed. Sanders tries to convince the police that Stanwyck is insane and should be committed to an asylum.

For the first time, this film has been made available on home video and it looks wonderful in high definition on blu-ray. The disc is a typical no-frills affair with only a trailer as a bonus feature.

Highly recommended for those who love film noir.",1417651200,15,864,4.785234899328859
5256538,3,B0093SSACK,"Woman witnesses a murder across the street from her window. She calls the police. You watch what happens next.

This movie went from interesting to just unbelievable. Who witnesses a murder and is talked out of what they saw later? I don't know anyone. The ending was just sensational nonsense. I think Barbara Stanwyck should have stuck to her matriach hard as nails roles instead of playing weak minded and bodied girls next door. Even her voice betrays her.

I will say that I was shocked to learn that this movie was set in LA. It definitely showed a normal, all-America classy setting for it to be from LA.",1417564800,,611,4.5963302752293576
5256539,3,B0093SSACK,"I watched this because Barbara Stanwyck was the star, but she was wasted in a plodding, improbable vehicle helmed by a director I've not heard of, yet shot by the great noir cameraman, John Alton. I found it very distracting when every close-up of Ms. Stanwyck was shot through gauze or a filter, so she looked badly out of focus, whereas Gary Merrill's close-ups in the same scene reverted to normal camera lens. (Her idea, or the director's or producer's?) The plot was not well-served by the humdrum script, and at times was so absurd that I burst out laughing. Imagine being chased by a man who has just declared his intention to murder you by defenestration, and where do you escape to? Simply the highest structure around, with him hot on your tail. Smart move, Barbara. There is little-to-no chemistry between the two principals, Merrill and Stanwyck... perhaps because she's hiding behind all that gauze and he can't actually get to her. And if they can commit a person to 72 hour observation at a mental hospital because she's been accused of sending poison pen letters, and keep her doped up to boot, then I'm thinking it must be the Gulag Archipelago and not familiar old L.A. A film to watch when there's not much else doing, I'd say. And a sad waste of acting talent.",1393891200,8,1280,4.643171806167401
5256540,3,B0093SSACK,"1954's crime drama, WITNESS TO MURDER, doesn't waste time in immersing you into its plot. One blustery night in the city of angels, a woman looks out her window and sees her neighbor strangling a girl in his apartment across the street. And yet when the police investigate, there is no evidence of a crime. The rest of the film chronicles the psychological cat-and-mouse game between the witness whom no one believes and the clever murderer who confounds her at every turn.

The production values are at the level of a teleplay, but it's okay. It's still an absorbing character study. You eyeball the elegant writer widower, Albert Richter (George Sanders), and you observe a gentleman seemingly beyond reproach. You shift your gaze to Cheryl Draper (Barbara Stanwyck), a hysterical interior designer, and you may pity her for her delusion. Or that's how it appears to the other characters onscreen. The movie audience, though, is aware from jump that Cheryl Draper didn't have a frightening dream, isn't being paranoid, isn't insane. Stanwyck and Sanders do a really good job of, respectively, playing the harried victim and the predatory killer. Most of the film's opening minutes focus on the murderer as he frantically works to erase all signs of evidence of his crime. Sanders generates enough of a sense of panic that you may even feel sympathy for him. Meanwhile, from the outset, Stanwyck doesn't generate warmth as much as she projects force. So, early on, you may find your allegiance surprisingly attached to the wrong person.

Albert Richter is dang clever in how he counters each of Ms. Draper's moves. And when he goes on the offensive, she doesn't stand a chance. There's a palpable psychological element as well. Richter is so diabolical that he near convinces Ms. Draper that she's mentally unstable. George Sanders, obviously having fun, manifests this devilish gleam in his eyes. You could tell his character relished messing with the woman's mind. As for Cheryl Draper, she's resilient but just cannot get traction. Even her police detective friend (Gary Merrill), while concerned for her, doesn't believe her. This goes on for most of the film. Disappointingly, the denouement doesn't deliver the goods. Observation (and perhaps a ***SPOILER ALERT*** for the rest of this sentence): When fleeing a deranged murderer who had just tried to push you out of a highrise window, it's not clever to then run into and then up another (and unoccupied) highrise.

I'm rating it a better-than-average 3 out of 5 stars, on the strength of Stanwyck and Sanders' solid performances. WITNESS TO MURDER today is relegated to obscure cinema, and perhaps it's because, less than a month after its 1954 release, Hitchcock's superior, similarly-themed REAR WINDOW debuted and right away cast a huge shadow over WITNESS TO MURDER. Them's the breaks.

If you're a fan of THE MISADVENTURES OF SHERIFF LOBO, keep an eye out for a brief, uncredited Claude Akins sighting as a cop stationed at a victim's apartment.

Also, read the product description before you order this. This DVD is NOT Region 1 and is probably not playable on U.S. DVD players.",1358208000,20,3144,5.015325670498084

5256549,2,B0093SSACK,"Gorgeous black and white cinematography by the great John Alton isn't enough to save this badly written thriller about a woman who witnesses a murder in the apartment across from hers--but the police don't believe her because there's no evidence.  Rather than try a did-he-or-didn't-he like Rear Window Witness To Murder leaves no doubt that the neighbor (George Sanders) is a killer because the movie shows us his character frantically hiding the body and disposing of evidence just before the police arrive.

The first 10 minutes aren't bad--but the script goes downhill fast after the police decide there was no murder, missing two pieces of evidence that were in plain sight in the process and making no attempt to find the place where he stashed the body just down the hall.  Then they make their terrible police work even worse by pressuring Stanwyck's character into saying the whole thing was only in her imagination before leaving.

The neighbor was a former Nazi, so he isn't going to be satisfied with the police not believing Ms. Stanwyck so he concocts a ludicrous plot to make her seem insane which even she starts to believe--yeah, right.  If the film had managed to set up a more equal cat and mouse game between Stanwyck and Sanders the movie would have been a lot more effective but the police in Witness to Murder are incompetent and Stanwyck's character does nothing smart during the entire course of the movie.  In fact during the movie's most idiotic scene, and, yes,  it is kind of hard to choose, when Stanwyck's character is brought down to the police station and accused of being insane she immediately proceeds to act as hysterical as possible, which is not a very good response if you want to convince people that you're not, you know, insane.

Witness to Murder is a dumb B movie with no suspense and a painfully ludicrous script but man does it look great.  The black-and-white compositions have gorgeous contrast, with shadows so deep and dark they look like they could swallow a city whole.  Cinematographer John Alton gives a master class in film-noir photography--and the Blu-ray transfer does a stunning job of reproducing his work.  Unfortunately, you're still stuck with unlikeable characters, unbelievable plot developments and a hard to ignore lack of thrills, wit, logic or imagination, which ends up making Witness to Murder one of the nicest looking bad movies you are ever likely to see.

Fans of lower rung Hollywood B-movies from the likes of PRC which were never known for their strong writing can probably add at least one star to my review and will undoubtedly enjoy this a whole lot more than I did.  But if you are looking for a solid A movie because Barbara Stanwyck is the lead you are in for a pretty big disappointment.",1442707200,,2773,4.812631578947369

5256556,5,B0093SSACK,"I was so glad to find this movie after years of searching. It is a rarely seen movie of mystery, murder and intrigue starring the best actress of all time, Miss Barbara Stanwyck. Her character sees a murder, but is convinced by others that she dreamed it and/or she is mentally insane. George Sanders plays the villain, and does he do a great job.

5256558,2,B0093SSACK,"Not top-tier thriller, but competently handled with some good dialogue mixed in with B movie trappings. It's the stars that put this over as no one plays a suave killer better than George Sanders or a lady in hysterics better than Barbara Stanwyck. The problem for me was the dvd itself (not blu ray , i don't buy blu rays )....very grainy with poor resolution and much worse than the viewing that TCM shows once in awhile. My second disappointment from Kino Lorber (the other being Gator). I don't understand why. I have many Kino dvds that are great as well as Koch Lorber's...but this new partnership is putting out inferior product. Three stars for the film, 1 star for the dvd evens out to a 2 star rating for this particular product.",1421452800,5,739,4.56390977443609

8535387,3,B0093SSACK,"A preposterous but moderately entertaining thriller combining elements of Rear Window with (of all things) Gaslight. Kino's release is a very clean print, but I will take issue with their choice of aspect ratio. While I suspect that Witness to Murder was indeed shown in the widescreen format, it was shot in Academy ratio. I have the spanish dvd of the film, and while that edition is not in the exceptional condition that this dvd is, it does have the entire image and in my opinion, John Alton's framing looks better in the old 1:37 format.",1510185600,,543,4.666666666666667
8535388,4,B0093SSACK,Kind of far-fetched but moves along at a good pace and delivers on the suspense. Stanwyck is good as always and Sanders is terrific as a truly evil character.,1509494400,,158,4.482758620689655

8535390,3,B0093SSACK,"2.5 stars. Very uninspired film noir. Rear Window is a much better version of a similar plot. There are way too many ""coincidences"" that occur in this film, so hte plot can't really be taken seriously. There is a really big hole: In the scene where Stanwyck (Miss Draper) is in the police dept., and George Sanders (as Richter,the bad guy) also enters the police office for the first time, the two have presumably never ever met before. Yet Richter acts surprised that Stanwyck is there, and says hello to her, addressing her as ""Miss Draper"". Yet, neither one has ever met the other, let alone seen the other, before. In fact, later in the film, when Stanwyck is being questioned by the psychiatrist, she states that she had never seen Richter before, until the night she saw him murder the girl across the way. So, this is some sloppy film-making.

The chase scene at the end is completely out of place -- not believable at all. Stanwyck's character should have latched onto the police woman, who shows up at her door. (But, why is the police woman at her door? Presumably because she was supposed to be keeping tabs on Richter -- who happened to have broken into Stanwyck's apartment (somehow), waiting to murder her.) OK, so Stanwyck runs away and goes up the steps of a high-rise under construction. Really? And Richter is chasing after her. Where is the police woman? Where is anyone else? Amazingly, nobody else is running to the top of the vacant building until Gary Merrill (Stanwyck's ""boyfriend"" detective) arrives on the scene and runs up. Then, Richter tries to fight and/or kill the detective! This is all too preposterous. It has the qualities of a film noir, but lacks dialog, editing, story.

But, the cinematography is good.",1498953600,,1742,4.7269736842105265
8535391,2,B0093SSACK,"Reluctantly, I will be generous, since this is one of the STUPIDEST scripts ever to come out of Hollywood, but I must give it two stars for the acting.

George Sanders is always one of my favorites, but a former Nazi? The minor actors and the scene in the hospital are beyond redemption. Jesse White, one of my favorite TV comedic actors, is completely miscast as a detective.",1498262400,,376,4.529411764705882
8535392,3,B0093SSACK,"Not anywhere near as good as Rear Window or another little gem, The Window (with Barbara Hale) . This movie is actually kind of silly.. with Babs tooling around in her little car or running down the street in high heels for most of the film.... and the romance aspect between her and Larry doesn't ring true.. but having said that, it is film noir and it is Barbara Stanwyck and there are a few genuinely creepy moments in it.. it's not a real long movie.. so for a quick late night treat, it's fine. The movie starts wtih Barbara Stanwyck waking up late at night because a storm has kicked up and she fell asleep with a window open..she goes to close the window and sees or thinks she sees a murder across the way.. realistically  there is no way that she could have looked out, focused, and comprehended what she saw or thought she saw.. that quickly.. she got the shocked look on her face before she got to the window.. a rare misstep for Babs..she calls the police and it goes from there. Addendum: I've watched this movie several times now.. it just kind of grows on you. I love Gary Merrill..he was so handsome and sexy in the day. George Saunders is really very cunning. There is one really creepy moment when she comes back to her dark apt, and doesn't realize he is there till he strikes that match.. I am very glad I bought this.",1486425600,,1339,4.334661354581673
