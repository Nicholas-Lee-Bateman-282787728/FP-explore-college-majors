5130230,2,B00843TZGU,"Hay que aclarar que esta es la presentacin en la Expo mundial de Sevilla 1992 de guitarristas de jazz, en una primera parte si hay diferentes msicos haciendo temas de Miles pero despes, hay otras interpretaciones que nada tienen que ver con la obra de Davis, ademas tecnicamente es la misma calidad que el ""bootleg"", que circula desde hace mucho tiempo.",1322179200,,353,4.80327868852459
5130231,2,B00843TZGU,"the only reason for the 2 stars is because of the quality. the show itself is superb. great line up of artists. but the video is very blurry and the sound is bad. like something you can watch on youtube.
get it if you like to see all the great artists jamming together.",1317945600,3,269,4.09433962264151
8524973,5,B00843TZGU,Great music and great camera angles. Music as expected is recreations of Miles Davis' mid 1960s band by the original musicians (Except Miles who has just died when this was recorded). Lots of close ups of the individual musicians so it was easy to see how they made the music... I will be watching this again and again to see what Tony Williams does to make the drums so magical.,1473120000,,379,4.428571428571429
8524974,1,B00843TZGU,"I LOVE Miles Davis and all of the artists on the DVD.  However, the DVD was CRAP ! The video quality was fuzzy and distorted.  It was a horrible mix of a great concert.  I won't even have guests view it its so bad",1454544000,,213,3.7954545454545454
8524975,5,B00843TZGU,"If you are an aficionado of Miles' music, this is a must for your collection. Order it now.",1439424000,,91,4.111111111111111
8524976,4,B00843TZGU,"The best Jazz concert ever done is marred by the transfer from a VHS tape to DVD, so consequently the picture & sound is just fair, which is a shame. Transfers from VHS to DVD shouldn't be allowed and only clean reproductions should be done. This awesome live Jazz concert very badly needs a clean High Definition transfer from the source to be put on Blu-Ray, otherwise we're lucky that it's available. It's a must have for Jazz-Bop fans.",1438128000,,439,4.569620253164557
8524977,5,B00843TZGU,"If your a guitar  freak, you will love  this DVD
George Benson John McLaughlin Larry Coryell Paco delucia are simply exquisite.",1421193600,,127,5.0
8524978,4,B00843TZGU,Very Good guitar concert on Sevilla 1992. But what this magnificent guitar players have to do with Miles Davis?,1412553600,,111,4.894736842105263
8524979,5,B00843TZGU,"It may not be a tribute to Miles though, it is how you can enjoy the music. Breathtaking camera work on Paco's performances are just fantastic. I sincerely would like Mr. J.M. and L.C. to learn how to play guitar from this Spanish giant (maybe it's too late.)
100 million % satisfied!",1401408000,,284,4.480769230769231
8524980,5,B00843TZGU,Apart from waiting so long to get a DVD copy - think 20 years now there is nothing more to say - the music is amazing as on cd tribute to miles issued some time ago in 1994 with the same cast. Thanks,1366070400,2,199,3.6511627906976742
8524981,4,B00843TZGU,"I also have a bootleg of this group with Miles in Milan...early 60s.

This group was and is stunning.

Concerning this video under review, the picture quality is not the best but the audio is very very good...not 2013 pristine chapel good, but much more than good enough.  Happy we have this.

I hate to say it, but Wallace Roney is so good and so humble that you don't miss Miles......  Um, I guess I just said it.

 I love Miles and his music.  No one better to represent it than this group.  That said I'll also get the new Miles Davis Live in Poland 1983 DVD with Al Foster and John Scofield = Phenonmenal.  But this group is still considered Mile's best...so who better for a great tribute in a great DVD.",1363996800,4,710,4.2706766917293235
8524982,5,B00843TZGU,"A Tribute to Miles Davis was filmed in Lugano, Switzerland on July 2nd, 1992.  The concert is absolutely amazing! What a beautiful tribute to Miles from Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Tony Williams & Wallace Roney!
Tony Williams plays his drums with such energy! This is first time I see Him playing on video. All musicians have a blast! They enjoy playing all this music for themselves & for the rest of us.
The set list:
1. SO WHAT  (9:27)
2. R.J.  (6:16)
3. LITTLE ONE  (10:23)
4. PINOCCHIO  (10:07)
5. ALL BLUES  (12:06)
6. DRUM SOLO  (2:54)
7. ELEGY  (11:15)
8. ORBITS/PARAPHANALIA  (13:48)
9. EIGHTY ONE/THE SORCERER  (14:58)
10. PEE WEE/THE THEME  (8:36)

Total Time: 1h 40min
Sound quality is good: Dolby Stereo.
Video quality: OK: it is a copy of VHS tape to DVD - so we have 240 lines max. A lot of ""noise"". It is like making your own copy of old videotape to DVD disc. But it is superb concert, so the sound is more important anyway!
Highly recommended to all MUSIC fans!",1362096000,6,994,4.4916201117318435
