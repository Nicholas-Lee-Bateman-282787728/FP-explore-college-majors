936812,5,6304865422,"without a doubt, the best tv drama ever made.  unrelenting suspense.  even though you knew he'd always get away, you had to keep watching.  also, a master class in camera acting--david janssen was simply the best.",958694400,2,213,4.861111111111111
936813,5,6304865422,"Some Fugitive fans refuse to watch this episode (the final one) because they don't want the closure. They want to imagine that Richard Kimble is still running. I understand how they feel -- but I say give the poor doctor  a break!
Go ahead and watch this episode. It's not the best example of  the show, but it's still pretty darn good. There are lots of twists. (I  still wonder why the one-armed man climbed to the top of the water tower to  escape Kimble. Where was he going to go from _there_?)
If you can, watch  the other episodes, too. You get to see 1960s drama at its best. Back then,  TV shows didn't have adult language, but they could still have adult  plots.
David Janssen's work in this show was underrated. So was the work  of Barry Morse. There were lots of great supporting actors, from Angie  Dickinson to Telly Savalas to William Shatner.
This show had the highest  ratings of any TV drama until the ""Who Shot J.R."" episode. I  think this one far surpassed it. (The writers of ""The Fugitive""  respected their audience more -- they never had David Janssen come out of  the shower and realize it was all a dream.)

936814,5,6304865422,"""August 29th, the day the running stopped.""  A day I'll always remember because it was the end of my favorite TV show, still is today.  ""The Judgment"" by today's standards, was done somewhat poorly,  sort of put together on a whim to end the show.  But to me, it is cherished  and sacred !
I didn't like how it ended.  I would have liked for the  one-armed man to have lived and been captured - and then have the courtroom  proceedings that released Richard Kimble shown as a final episode.
Bill  Raisch was incredible in the part he played as the one-armed man. Couldn't  have found a more believable actor for the role - He didn't need acting  ability - he was a natural.  No one could have played a better derelict  drifter, at least in my opinion no one couldn't.
David Janssen should  have been a bigger star than he was.  He should have been on the same level  as Sean Connory - and today, would be a bigger star. He is the epitomy of  ""Cool.""
In the last 30 years, the only show close to ""The  Fugitive"" as a continuing Drama was ""Hill Street Blues.""",945216000,11,1057,4.279187817258883

David Janssen is Richard Kimble,  using the alias Paul Beaumont, now working as timekeeper to a construction  project under Buck (Klugman).  Kimble also serves as a surrogate big  brother to Jamie (Taylor), a retarded young man whose physical strength  lands him a job at the site that he needs to feed his family.  The other,  older men at the site mercilessly taunt Jamie, leading to a fight early on  between Kimble/Beaumont and a particularly vicious bully named Dan  (Best).
In addition to his relationship with Jamie and Buck, Kimble also  gets swept into the angst between Buck and his wife (Allen), who wants to  have a child but cannot because Buck fears that he cannot father a healthy  child.
Eventually Buck's wife is attacked and beaten nearly to death, and  the clues indicate it was the work of Jamie.  Kimble is certain Jamie  didn't do it, and has to stop a lynch mob led by Buck to prove it.",931392000,6,1164,4.688118811881188

936817,4,6304865422,"This tape contains two episodes of the classic 1960s drama starring David Janssen and Barry Morse.  Nemesis originally aired in October of 1964 while World's End aired earlier, in September of '64.

Nemesis may be the more fascinating of the two episodes. While driving his son Phil Jr. (Kurt Russell) on a camping trip,  Lt. Gerard learns that Kimble is in the area.  He leaves Junior with the wife of Sheriff Deebold, but the youngster hides in their car as they close on The Fugitive.  Kimble steals the car - and is shocked to find the son of his enemy in his presence.

Junior does all he can to leave clues to Kimble's whereabouts - he leaves a trail of football cards (Kimble confiscates the cards, then mails them back at the end), he lights a campfire, then leaves a sweater folded into an arrow delineating their  direction (Gerard Sr. notes that ""Phil never folded a sweater that neatly before in his life"").  Eventually the two fugitives are caught by a local hunter named Corbin (Slim Pickens), but Kimble beats him up and escapes.  Junior pursues but steps on a bear trap.  Kimble frees him, and Junior's view of The Fugitive changes completely.

The earlier episode, World's End, is a more romantic story.  Kimble reads a personal ad from ""EB"" - Eleanor Burnett, the daughter of John Burnett, his defense attorney who died soon after the trial.  Eleanor Burnett and her mother Ada (Carmen Matthews) had hired a private detective to continue searching for Kimble's one-armed man and the private eye has found someone.  But this one-armed man dies in a fire outside of Kansas City, news that devastates Kimble to the point where he drives to the area himself and verifies the story.

But the private eye does some more checking and finds that this one-armed man was incarcerated at the time of Helen Kimble's murder, but Eleanor Burnett has fallen in love with Kimble and withholds this information so she can have him - and hot on their trail is Lt. Gerard, who knows the Burnetts from when John was alive.",925344000,21,2020,4.682719546742209

936911,5,6304865422,"I was turned on to this show by my uncle who was a diehard fan during its original run. I was only 3 when ""The Judgement"" aired in August of 1967, so naturally, I would not have been old enough to have recalled anything about this show, but in early 1992, while A&E ran episodes of ""The Fugitive"" in syndication, I finally had the chance to see Richard Kimble finally nail the one-armed man. At the time, I thought that this was really a cool ending to the show, even if it was 25 years after the fact. Upon reading some of the comments here, I have some info to share, courtesy of ""The Fugitive: Recaptured"", a book by Ed Robertson. As it turned out, George Eckstein and Michael Zagor, who co-wrote the finale, were up against a time deadline to write the script, which is why, by Eckstein's admission, isn't perfect. ABC wanted a 5th season, but David Janssen was the one who called a halt to the show, mainly due to his own exhaustion, so Eckstein and Zagor had to sort of rush to write the script. Nonetheless, a classic ending to a classic TV show. It was also interesting to discover Lloyd Chandler as the ""surprise witness"" to Helen Kimble's murder, but at least the show resolved its premise, as most people expected. Props to Roy Huggins for giving us arguably the best show of the 1960s. David Janssen, God rest his soul, was terrific as Richard Kimble, and equal props to Barry Morse and Bill Raisch for keeping the fans on the edge of their seats every week for four years.",1073088000,,1485,4.403636363636363
936912,4,6304865422,"What up to then was the largest television audience ever tuned in to watch Dr. Richard Kimball's four-year flight from unjustice come to an end. ""The Fugitive,"" disputably inspired by the 1954 murder in Ohio by Dr. Sam Shepherd of his wife, Marilyn, remained aloft the Nielsen pack during its entire run until David Janssen, pushed for his character's final absolution. It comes here in the two-hour series finale that has Dr. Kimball, laboring at one in a series of menial jobs, recognizing in a newspaper article the face of the infamous one-armed man he saw fleeing from his home in Indiana four years earlier. Trekking to Los Angeles in a bid to corner his wife's killer, Kimball instead walks into capture by his dogged nemesis, Lt. Gerard. After he extradites Kimball back to Indiana, though, Gerard soon begins to doubt his own certain about the doctor's guilt. By then, the one-armed killer also has returned to Indiana, and there's the inevitable final showdown between the wrongly accused and the guilty. Sure, only entertainment, but the series' final line, "" ...the day the running stopped,"" fills us with a sense of vindication, and we say good-bye to Dr. Kimball with the hope that, finally, he can resume a life interrupted by a miscarriage of justice that cost him four years of his life.",1043971200,,1304,4.852017937219731
936913,4,6304865422,"This video contains one episode from the first season, FLIGHT FROM THE FINAL DEMON and one from the second, CRY UNCLE. Both are quality episodes with each revealing varying aspects of Kimble's personality. In FFFD, Kimble is apprehended while working in a health club, but gets help from a fellow worker, played convincingly by Ed Nelson.  Steve Edson (Nelson) helps Kimble only because he is the obverse of the fugitive.  He is a guilty man who at his trial was found innocent, and his conscience bothers him to the point that he wants to be caught.  During Kimble's and his flight from the law, Edson keeps dropping clues as to their whereabouts.  What is of interest to viewers is that for the first time, Kimble verbalizes what many would be lam artists might need to know: the many 'tricks' that a fugitive needs to know to avoid capture.  Carroll O'Connor, in his pre-ALL IN THE FAMILY DAYS, is convincing as the pursuing sheriff.  CRY UNCLE is the better of the two.  At the start of the show, Kimble seeks refuge in an orphanage and two boys suspect that he is a fugitive, and Kimble must use his natural affinity for children that he had shown in previous episodes to convince them not to turn him in. Ronny Howard of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and Donald Losby, who played Mark Welles in the series' opener FEAR IN A DESERT CITY, play the two boys.  The only way for Kimble as Pat Thomas to explain his presence is for him to pose as Sean's (Losby) uncle.  At first, Sean is unruly and seeks only to kick back at a world that has smacked him around since birth.  Kimble seems like a perfect target, one who must obey him or risk being turned over to the police.  But ever so slowly, Kimble's inherent goodness teaches him that not all adults are evil, and that if he is to advance in the world, he must learn to trust others.  And this is one of the subtle subtexts that appear in many of the shows.  Trust can appear in the most unexpected of places, and when it does, that person ought to let it grow.",1026172800,,2009,4.397297297297297
936914,4,6304865422,"In WORLD'S END and NEMESIS, both from the start of season two, directors Robert Butler and Jerry Hopper continue the high quality of scripting and plotting that came to characterize the first season.  Since the audience was both large and loyal, the scripters thankfully did not feel the need to jazz up their scripts with ideas that abandoned strong character development and frequent use of Kimble's past.  Suzanne Pleshette, who plays Ellie Burnett in WORLD'S END, is one of Kimble's most memorable leading romantic interests.  Off screen, they were carrying on a real life relation and that chemistry showed.  Miss Pleshette was also used successfully in another episode, ALL THE SCARED RABBITS. The booming voice of narrator William Conrad, besides being used to repeat the most famous example of a run on sentence in literary history that began each episode, also narrated prepared introductions that provided useful information. Conrad tells the viewer that Kimble is reading from his hometown newspaper and sees in the classifieds: 'Personal to R. K. Have information, regarding September 17th. Phone me at home. Urgent. E. B.'  Unfortunately for Kimble, Lieutenant Gerard reads the Stafford Sentinel too and guesses correctly who 'RK' and 'EB' are. Burnette has long loved Kimble and will do anything to be with him.  She has information about the one-armed man that disheartens Kimble--the one-armed man is dead, thus opening the way for Kimble to cease looking for him and perhaps settle down permanently somewhere with her.  At the last moment, she receives word that her information was in error. The one-armed man yet lives.  The dramatic focus is on Gerard's tailing Burnett to catch Kimble and on whether she will hide the error and keep Kimble or tell the truth and lose him to further searches.  This episode is a fine one in that it explores the ethical limits that a woman will go to keep a man.  Plus the aura of Gerard in the background generates further suspense.
  NEMESIS is another superb episode because it contains a number of themes that enrich the complexity of the relation between pursued and pursuer. The focus is mostly on Gerard and his son.  The audience has seen Gerard mostly as a monomaniacal hunter of Kimble.  He seems to live and breathe his job to catch the fugitive.  But this total involvement comes with a price.  Every day that he is on the road chasing Kimble is one day less that he has for himself and his family. NEMESIS shows Gerard in one of his rare days of relaxation with his son as they go on a camping trip.  The boy, well-played by Kurt Russell, likes his dad and looks forward to spending time with him. By coincidence, Kimble is working near where Gerard plans to camp. When a local cop notifies Gerard that Kimble is in the area, Gerard is seen as having to make a choice that he must make often in future episodes.  He must sacrifice his family for his duty.  He does so here, and asks the cop's wife to mind the boy for the duration of the hunt. A plot complication is the boy's decision to hide out in the sheriff's car which Kimble steals to escape. Thus Gerard's son, Phil Jr., is an unwitting hostage.  When his father finds out where his boy is, he reveals a side of his personality that he tries hard to suppress, that Kimble may not be guilty of murder after all.  Gerard does not show concern that Kimble might harm his son.  He tells the sheriff: 'He'll feed the boy.' Phil Jr. tries to help his father by leaving clues as to his whereabouts.  Kimble again shows his inner goodness by helping Phil Jr recover from an injury even at the risk of recapture.
  This episode and its companion are well-written and show aspects of the universe of Kimble and Gerard that immeasurably enhance the pleasure of their watching.",1026172800,8,3789,4.730593607305936
936915,3,6304865422,"One of the most commonly used themes that the script writers of THE FUGITIVE liked was the one of a man, other than Richard Kimble, being falsely accused of a crime.  During the course of a four year run, this sort of thing routinely happened.  In TERROR AT HIGHPOINT, Jamie, a strong but mentally disabled young man, is hired by Buck (well played by Jack Klugman). The other field workers taunt him mercilessly, causing Kimble to take pity on him and offer whatever solace he could.  In many episodes Kimble shows his essential goodness of nature by helping those humans and animals who are in need of that help.  Buck's wife is attacked but cannot identify the attacker.  Naturally, the confused Jamie is blamed, who runs away in fear.  Later, Kimble learns that the predator is one of the posse members.
  This is one of the very ordinary episodes, whose only saving grace is to further bring out Kimble's willingness to help others even at the risk of his own detection.",1026086400,2,974,4.654970760233918
936916,4,6304865422,"THE FUGITIVE was the first drama that had a concluding episode that tied up the loose ends. For those who had watched the series faithfully for four years were generally satisfied with the closure, despite the several logical inconsistencies in the two-part finale. THE JUDGMENT allows Richard Kimble to regain his life by finally catching the man with one arm, but it is the manner that he did it that provides an emotionally satisfying end to a roller coaster of a series that millions of viewers religiously followed. The charm of THE JUDGMENT is that it encapsulates in one twin segment the very qualities that had stamped its high quality since the 1963-64 season. Many of the themes, ideas, character developments, and plot devices were combined with a surprise twist to justify the time America spent to get involved in the running triangle between Kimble, Lieutenant Gerard, and Fred Johnson, the one-armed man.
 Director George Eckstein borrowed heavily from earlier episodes to frame a finale in a way that ties together a myriad of strands that had been left hanging from previous episodes. Gerard learns that a one-armed man has been arrested in Los Angeles and suspects that Kimble will read of it as well. His hope is that Kimble will try to see this man to verify his identity. This is exactly the same plot device that the show used in NEVER WAVE GOODBYE from the first season. It worked well then and works well now. Kimble does indeed read of this in a Tucson newspaper where he works. For viewers with long memories, Tucson was also the setting for the very first episode, FEAR IN A DESERT CITY. Gerard flies to Los Angeles and questions Fred Johnson in a manner that clearly shows the evolution of Gerard's certainty of Kimble's guilt to a doubt. Gerard shouts at him, 'Did you kill Helen Kimble?' From a dramatic standpoint, this doubt is required to make it plausible that Gerard would later believe in the possibility of Kimble's innocence long enough to give him twenty-four hours to find Johnson. Kimble arrives in Los Angeles where he is reunited with Jean Carlisle, played by Diane Baker, who was the court reporter at the trial and has long loved Kimble. She tips him off about the trap and hides him in her apartment. Gerard nevertheless suspects that she is hiding Kimble and tricks him into taking a taxi, where he arrests Kimble. While this is going on, the plot takes a surprise twist when Johnson is bailed out by a man who is later revealed as Lloyd Chandler, Kimble's next door neighbor in Stafford, who was right there in the living room when he saw Johnson kill Helen Kimble. But since he did not want to expose himself as a coward, he kept his mouth shut and left Kimble as the sacrificial lamb to his own shame. This surprise revelation of an eyewitness to Kimble's innocence was prefigured in an earlier episode, TRIAL BY FIRE, where an army captain also saw Johnson run out of the Kimble residence just moments before Kimble returns home in his car. Johnson seeks to blackmail Chandler, who intends to kill Johnson to insure his silence. At the closing reel. Johnson inextricably climbs a high tower with Kimble in pursuit. At the top, they battle, and in a scene of high tension, Johnson admits that he murdered Helen Kimble. Gerard saves Kimble's life by shooting Johnson dead. Using Chandler's account of Kimble's innocence, the case and the series close.
 This last episode had the largest cast in the series' history. Besides the usual sterling acting of David Janssen and Barry Morse, Kimble's sister Donna, well played by Jacqueline Scott, reprises her continuing role as the emotional bedrock of support that she has provided for Kimble's entire run. Bill Raisch as Fred Johnson again radiates menace in every grimace of his brutal face. His lack of an arm in no way diminishes his aura of alarm. Diane Brewster, who plays Helen Kimble, is finally seen as more than just a corpse that lies on the floor with the opening scene that begins each episode. The flashbacks of THE JUDGEMENT portray her as a woman who loves her husband but has marital problems with him. Incidentally, her issues with Kimble are the only time in the show's four year run that show any woman as having relating problems at all with Kimble. In the show's last few minutes, when reporters swarm around Kimble and Jean Carlisle and ask him what he intends to do now that he is again a free man, Kimble replies, 'I want to start my life up again.' And part of this start is to shake the hand of the policeman who admits his part in putting an innocent man through four years of hell. Kimble and Jean walkoff into the sunset, ready to start their new life. Gerard walks off in the opposite direction, ready to do the same. And the viewer turns off his television, not quite ready to abandon the memories of watching one man seeking to reclaim a life that had been unfairly put on hold for that same four years.",1026086400,7,4930,4.672036823935558
936917,5,6304865422,"During the four year run of THE FUGITIVE, there were two kinds of episodes that stood out as exceptional: the kind that dealt with Kimble's past and the trial (like LANDSCAPE WITH RUNNING FIGURES and THE GIRL FROM LITTLE EGYPT) and those that developed Kimble's relation with another character, usually a romantic interest, so that the inevitable pain on parting is seen as the price he had to pay to maintain his freedom. NEVER WAVE GOODBYE is an example of the latter type, not only because of the terrific chemistry between David Janssen and his love interest Susan Oliver, but also because of the almost unbearable suspense generated by the oh-so-close chase scenes of Lieutenant Gerard.
Kimble as Jeff Cooper is hiding out in Santa Barbara, California, as a sailmaker. He has been on the run for only several months, but he is already fatigued, both physically and emotionally. This two part episode is the fourth entry in the series and in each of the first three, Kimble has had fleeting relations with Vera Miles (FEAR IN A DESERT CITY), Patricia Crowley (THE WITCH), and Sandy Dennis (THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN). With all three women, Kimble has learned the dangers of permitting love to cloud his judgment.  Yet he yearns for more than superficiality.  Now with Karen, played convincingly by the lovely Susan Oliver, Kimble can reassess the cost versus benefit of staying.  At first, he tells her that he will leave, but he changes his mind, partly because of his love for her, and partly because he has seen a newspaper article about the arrest of a one-armed man in Los Angeles, and he is determined to see if this is the same man who killed his wife.  Gerard, too,has seen this article and correctly guesses that Kimble will go to the jail to see this man.  Kimble does only to find out that this is the wrong man.  Gerard spots him in the jail, but Kimble manages to escape.  It is at this point that Kimble tries reverse psychology on Gerard.  Kimble assumes that Gerard will think that he would leave the scene after having been identified, and so Kimble decides to stay.  Unfortunately for Kimble, Gerard is smarter than that and decides to stay to search for him. And search he does.  Gerard locates the sailmaking store where Kimble works, but Kimble and Karen escape in a rowboat with Gerard pursuing in a dinghy.  Gerard's dinghy crashes on the beach and he would have drowned had not Kimble saved his life.  Kimble tells Karen that despite his love for her, he is now sure that he must resume his search for the one-armed man.  This episode is one of the best of the series. The viewer can see the weariness vanish from Kimble's mind as he allows himself the very temporary luxury of the good life with the woman he now loves. There is also the personal confrontation at the end when Gerard is still weak from his near death and tells Kimble, 'Give yourself up. I'll always be one step behind you.' The audience can sense that this cat-and-mouse game that had so believably been enacted on the screen must be re-enacted in the future. The chemistry between Janssen and Oliver was so intense that when the finale of the series was aired four years later, I hoped that it would be Susan Oliver who would wind up as Kimble's permanent partner. It wasn't but NEVER WAVE GOODBYE captures for a brief time the barest suggestion of what it must have been like for the Good Man to have to walk the fine line between having a semblance of a normal life and having the freedom to seek to regain that life.",1026086400,7,3522,4.589171974522293
936918,4,6304865422,"The first episode of THE FUGITIVE, FEAR IN A DESERT CITY, established what was to be a successful formula for the next four seasons.  Doctor Richard Kimble is accused of his wife's murder.  He knows that a one-armed man is the culprit, but can't prove it.  He is tried, found guilty, and sentenced to die in the electric chair.  On route to the death house, he escapes from Lieutenant Philip Gerard, who then spends much of the next four years chasing a doctor who is similarly chasing his quarry.  At the start of this initial episode, the sonorous narration of William Conrad informs the audience of this background information.  Kimble, who now calls himself Jim Lincoln, rides a bus into Tucson, Arizona, and finds work as a bartender.  He strikes up a relation with Monica Welles, played by Vera Miles, only to find that his anonymity is threatened when her rich but crazy ex-husband stalks her and wonders at the temerity of a drifter to dare date the ex-wife of a local powerful and influential citizen. The plot revolves around Kimble's helping Monica to escape from her ex.
  This episode established the basic persona of pursuer and pursued.  Kimble is the good doctor yanked out of his comfortable life, with the audience wondering whether he can regain that life.  Barry Morse as Lt. Gerard is the policeman who trails him with a monomania that does not become clearer until future episodes.  It is David Janssen's tremendous acting that made this show a monster hit.  His interpretation of Richard Kimble suggests a controlled fear that is never absent.  Kimble simply cannot permit himself the luxury of a relationship.  When he does, the result is often to expose him to danger.  Every time, I saw Kimble impacting on others, I knew that I was seeing how one bright but faceless man kept his hopes up to reclaim a life that I knew one day would return.  This was a terrific first episode that hooked an audience for four more years.",1025913600,11,1947,4.71301775147929

937015,4,6304865422,"What an auspicious beginning for a TV classic!  Richard
Kimble (David Janssen) takes up in Tucson, AZ where he becomes a bartender.  He befriends and courts a nightclub singer (Vera Miles) who is married to a mean, abusive husband (Brian Keith).  Keith is splendid as the possessive,
drunken Ed Welles with the friends and the funds to deflect criticism.
  Kimble tries to lay low and avoid any attention which would attract the police and ultimately, Lt. Gerard, played by Barry Morse.  Welles alerts the police about Kimble and an investigation ensues.  Kimble is genuinely shaken afterwards in a manner which sets the tone for the entire series.  Kimble decides to leave Tucson after confessing
to Welles wife, leading to a final confrontation with the enraged husband.
  Gerard makes a brief appearance and Kimble talks about
the trial to Welles wife.  These issues would be covered in later episodes.  The pilot has a rare ongoing narration of Kimble's  mindset by William Conrad.
  This episode - and others to follow - depict a Janssen who
occasionally seems ill at ease and self conscious in front  of the camera.  At times he even underdelivers lines.  If was as if Janssen was unsure of himself and his abilities.  He had no reason to be.  For Janssen and this show were about to become an enduring fixture on the television landscape.

937016,3,6304865422,"This great series deserved a great ending.  This great series did not have a good ending.  The two part conclusion
of The Fugitive did not equal the excellent writing, attention to details or characterizations of its predecessors.  There were too many inconsistencies, coincidences, and outright
absurdities to qualify Judgement as the penultimate Fugitive
finale.  First off, Kimble sees a newspaper that happens to
have a picture of the one-armed man in an LA bar.  Second,
Gerard, while grilling the one-armed man about a barfight,
loses his cool and suddenly questions him about  Helen Kimble's murder.  Gerard never wanted to believe in a one armed man, despite having confronted him in the past.  Gerard wanted to believe that he wasn't wasting his time chasing the wrong man.  Third, Gerard is seen walking through the police station by a Jean Carlisle whose father
happens to be a friend of Kimble's.  Why did it take 119 episodes for her to pop up in Kimble's life?  A better choice
of woman would've been either Susan Oliver or Suzanne
Pleshette since both had a past with Kimble.  Fourth, Kimble goes to LA and is taken in by Gerard.  Gerard then
agrees to give Kimble 24 hours to find the one-armed man.
  Again, this is a man who had Kimble in his hand on numerous occasions.  If saving the Gerard family didn't convince the lieutenant of Kimble's innocence, then neither
would a chance encounter with the one-armed man.
  Fifth, Kimble confronts the one-armed man (Fred Johnson) at an amusement park.  Kimble orders Johnson to hold.  Johnson fires his gun and takes off running.  Kimble was a onetime skeet shooter champion.  A basic shot to Johnson's good arm or one of his legs keeps him from committing absurdity number six....
Running to and climbing up a tower unarmed!  Why have
Johnson take this information atop a tower when Kimble needs him alive for exoneration?  Even if Johnson confesses it would be his word against Kimble's.
For all of that madness, just have Johnson commit suicide
along the way and leave it at that.
  So Johnson gets the gun from Kimble and as he takes aim, Gerard shoots him with a rifle from the man who witnessed Helen Kimble's murder.  Again, why did it take
120 episodes for this  so called friend of Kimble's to reluctantly admit to witnessing the Helen Kimble homicide?
He only let Kimble go through a private hell and a near execution.
  Nevertheless, it was unprecedented for ANY series to
to conclude with a final episode.  That concept deviated from
the norm.  The Fugitive should be remembered for its well
casted lead and supporting cast, cutting edge issues, creative methods of escape for Kimble, and great visual
locales.  These qualities helped the show to stand the test of time and STILL compare to and eclipse today's idea of
great programming.  In my mind, The Fugitive ranks as the
best drama of all time, hands down.",1017619200,7,2887,4.812627291242363
937017,5,6304865422,"I had seen this episode years ago when I was a kid. I remember everyone was so anxious for the conclusion the following week. I had looked for this episode for years, I was finally able to find it on Amazon.com. Anyone who ever enjoyed ""The Fugitive"", absolutly must have this. I only wish it was available on DVD.",1013558400,10,314,4.338983050847458
937018,4,6304865422,"The 2-part final episode of The Fugitive is not nearly my favorite episode, even though Dr. Kimble (David Janssen) is finally cleared of the murder charge against his wife, which has haunted him from day 1 of this exceptionally entertaining television series.

Running from September 17, 1963 thru August 29, 1967, ""The Fugitive"" kept its star running too. I think Richard Kimble must have hit nearly every state in the union during the show's 4-year stint.

This final program (The Judgment) has a good ending, but overall I have always felt a bit disappointed with it.  First off, it's one of the latter years' color episodes (which, to a degree, automatically makes it worse than earlier B&W programs).  As is usually the case with most TV programs, the earlier black-and-white episodes seem to be the best.  Secondly, I thought the re-capturing of Kimble by Lt. Gerard here was pretty weak (especially when compared to other exciting examples in the series).  And third, I would have enjoyed it more if Gerard and Kimble had been kept apart during most of this final program, rather than ""teaming up"" together to try and solve the case.  It would have been more dramatic to have Kimble on the run to the very end I believe.

But, despite the above complaints about ""The Judgment"", I still enjoy watching it. Even the worst of Fugitive episodes would still be a whole lot better than the best efforts of a lot of programs.

Two very good reasons for loving The Fugitive TV series:  David Janssen and Barry Morse.  Both actors are simply perfect in their parts.  The BEST episodes, I'm sure any true Fugitive fan would agree, are the ones where we encounter Gerard chasing his prey.  Nothing better on TV.

Gerard put it best at the very end of this program .... ""For four years, we've kept an innocent man in hell!""  ...  But now ""the running [has] stopped""!",1007596800,3,1861,4.715170278637771

He stays at a hotel and gets a job at the Branded Barhouse as a bartender where he befriends a pianist woman who is abused by her husband played by Brian Keith. Keith comes into the bar regualry for his scotch and soda and gets into arguments with Kimble also know in this episode as James Lincoln. Don't want to tell you more because you have to see this classic episode. This episode is great because this is the first episode of the best series of all time. You can find an actor as serious as David Janssen anymore. This episode is a must for series collectors.",990230400,6,703,4.333333333333333
937021,3,6304865422,"For four years (1963-1967) ""The Fugitive"" ruled the world of television dramas. The show ended abruptly due to the fact that the show's star, furtive David Janssen, was worn out from the gruelling schedule. He was ready to call it quits by mid-1967, so the producers had to scramble to find a way to end the show. Janssen, as pediatrician Richard Kimble, remains on the run from Indiana Police Lt. Philip Gerard, intent on bringing in the man who escaped from his custody en route to the death house, where Kimble's sentence would be finalized. In this two-part series ender, Kimble is working as a truck driver in the Southwest, when he discovers that the man who killed his wife was arrested in a bloody bar altercation in Los Angeles. Immediately, Kimble is on his way to Southern California intent on finding a way to keep the killer in prison, yet also clear his name. Gerard, of course, knows that Kimble is coming, and waits in L.A. for his elusive quarry to fall in his lap. The LAPD sets a trap for Kimble, but he escapes with the help of a family friend, Jean (Diane Baker). All the elements for a great ending are here, but certain plot devices fail: the scenes from Kimble's hometown in Indiana look like Southern California, complete with real palm trees; Gerard actually allows Kimble to chase after the killer, Fred Johnson, after being convinced Johnson was Kimble's fantasy obsession for years; and the pacing seems considerably rushed. However, the action sequences involving Kimble and the menacing Johnson are top-notch. Barry Morse (as Gerard) does a wonderful job as usual. Before the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" episode on Eighties nighttime soap, ""Dallas"", this two-partner was the highest-rated television show. It is not the strongest season-ender, but was much better than ""Seinfeld""'s. Sure, ""The Fugitive"" is a bit dated at times, but it is undeniably one of television's high points.

7878796,5,6304865422,"This VHS videotape contains two of my all-time favorite episodes of the always-entertaining 1963-1967 distinguished television drama, ""The Fugitive"". Both of these episodes (""Nemesis"" and ""World's End"") are from Season #2 of the series, which starred David Janssen as the forever-on-the-run Dr. Richard Kimble.

The best ""Fuge"" episodes are the ones that feature that relentless of all police detectives, Lt. Philip Gerard (Barry Morse). And both of these classics contain Gerard in all his chasing splendor. Two fine guest-star appearances are on tap here as well.

In ""Nemesis"" (originally shown on ABC-TV on October 13, 1964), a very young Kurt Russell (age 13) is featured as Phil Gerard, Jr. (Kurt also appears in another Fugitive episode later in the series, but not as Lt. Gerard's son). Kurt is very good in ""Nemesis"", as he accidentally stumbles upon his dad's number-one prey.

""Nemesis"" is another one of the many stellar cat-and-mouse episodes in this TV series, with Gerard hot on the trail of Dr. Kimble, only to have him slip through the dragnet at the very end. It's implausible, indeed, when you stop and think about it, that Kimble could evade capture time and time again during the course of this series' four-year run (especially considering such a shrewd pursuer as Gerard is chasing him). But any fan of ""The Fugitive"" can easily get beyond that and accept the premise that (somehow) Kimble is able to regain his freedom at the end of each episode. And, obviously, if he's captured, the series is over. So Kimble must elude the authorities each week.

The beautiful Suzanne Pleshette co-stars as ""Ellie Burnett"" in this tape's second offering, ""World's End"" (from September 22, 1964). Suzanne, like Russell, also was featured in one other episode of the series (""All The Scared Rabbits""), but not as the same character. Suzanne, as always, is terrific in ""World's End"", as she arranges for Dr. Kimble (and herself) to fly out of the country to Brazil, in order for the good doctor to elude Lt. Gerard's long arm of the law once more. Does Kimble get on that airplane with Suzanne? Watch this exciting episode and see for yourself. ;)

This 2-episode volume of ""Fugitive"" programs is definitely my favorite among this multi-volume series of videos that was issued by Republic Pictures (Republic Entertainment, Inc.) in 1998. It'd be hard to beat these two episode selections, IMO.

There's 98 minutes of chases and thrills on this VHS cassette, and the episode previews (""teasers"") that were shown before the main titles on each show are also fully intact here as well.

SOME DREAM-FILLED ""FUGE"" TALK:

I've taken the opportunity to expend a little bit of time and energy toward inventing my own personal ""DREAM DVD SET"" for ""The Fugitive"" (the entire series).

Have you ever done this? Create your own ""Fantasy DVD Set"" for a certain TV show or movie? It's all in good fun, and obviously many of the things I shall mention below could not possibly come to fruition, nor would the studio even begin to consider placing such extraordinary materials onto a DVD compilation. But it's fun to play around with in my own Fuge-infested mind anyway. ~wink~

So, here now is my ultimate DREAM DVD SET for David Janssen's ""The Fugitive"" -- a compilation so massive and spectacular it would surely bankrupt the studio producing it; but Fuge fans won't care -- because we'll have all of this great stuff at our digital fingertips! ~wide grin~......

7878797,5,6304865422,"""Never Wave Goodbye"", a two-part episode of the original TV series ""The Fugitive"", is presented on this Republic Pictures video.

Robert Duvall and Susan Oliver guest star opposite David Janssen's portrayal of the ever-running ""Dr. Richard Kimble"". This special ""two-parter"" has Kimble faking his own death via a boating accident, in an attempt to fool Police Lt. Philip Gerard (Barry Morse), who, as usual, is hot on Kimble's trail. Something as small and simple as a used matchstick leads Gerard to Dr. Kimble's whereabouts.

These two ""Goodbye"" episodes, which are in black-and-white, were part of ""The Fugitive's"" inaugural season of 1963-1964, first airing on the ABC television network in October of 1963 (October 8th and October 15th). These were just the fourth and fifth episodes of the series (which would eventually span 4 years and 120 hour-long programs).

This ""Republic"" video is ""Tape Two"" in its series of ""Fuge"" VHS cassettes. Picture quality on this tape is pretty good; video is in the Original Aspect (TV) Ratio of 1.33:1. Stereo sound is provided. Tape length = approximately 98 minutes.

Trivial Tidbits .............

Kimble's alias in this 2-part program -- ""Jeff Cooper"".

Locations depicted -- Santa Barbara, California and Los Angeles, California.

William Graham directed both Part 1 and Part 2 of ""Never Wave Goodbye"".

Doctor Kimble saves the life of his pursuer (Lt. Gerard) during Part 2 of ""Never Wave Goodbye"", marking the first time (of six!) that Kimble would rescue Gerard from near-certain death during the four-season course of this drama series. In fact, in one episode, ""Ill Wind"" (from Season #3), the good doctor saves Gerard's life TWICE within the same one-hour program! (That's a dandy episode too, featuring a terrific ending as Kimble eludes re-capture yet again.)",1102204800,3,1813,5.227586206896552
7878798,5,6304865422,"""Tape Six"" in Republic Pictures' series of ""Fugitive"" videos yields these two episodes of the highly-acclaimed dramatic television series:

1.) ""Stroke Of Genius"" (Episode 80; From Season 3; First aired February 1, 1966; B&W). .... More ""bad luck"" for convicted (but innocent) fugitive Richard Kimble (David Janssen) -- He gets a ride while hitch-hiking and the car in which he's riding suddenly crashes after the driver is killed by a random gunshot. Naturally, Kimble is the #1 suspect in this killing. And even Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard (played by Barry Morse) works to clear Kimble of this charge of murder. This is yet another fine episode featuring the two principal characters (Kimble and Gerard) on screen together.

Beau Bridges and Telly Savalas are guests in ""Stroke Of Genius"", along with Ellen Corby, Malcolm Atterbury, and Telly's brother, George Savalas. ... Directed by: Robert Butler. ... Kimble's Alias: Frank Whistler.

2.) ""Stranger In The Mirror"" (Episode 72; From Season 3; First aired December 7, 1965; B&W). .... William Shatner plays a killer in this Fugitive installment, who tries to pin a series of cop murders on Dr. Kimble. Norman Fell and Julie Sommars co-star. ... Directed by: Joseph Sargent. ... Kimble's alias: John Evans.

7878799,5,6304865422,"On this video: Two exciting episodes of ""THE FUGITIVE"" -- starring David Janssen in the title role.

Episodes included: ""Terror At High Point"" (1963) and ""Glass Tightrope"" (1963). This is the third volume in a collection of ""Fugitive"" tapes released by Republic Entertainment in 1998.

Both of these B&W shows in the popular ABC-TV series involve Doctor Richard Kimble (Janssen) being locked in an internal struggle of whether to help out another human being (who is being wrongfully accused, like Kimble himself), thereby risking his own safety and freedom, or to keep a safe distance from other people's troubles. (A common plot device utilized by the creative team of ""The Fugitive""; and a device that normally yielded very good results over the course of the 4-year period that the series was on the air.)

""Terror"" co-stars Jack Klugman, Elizabeth Allen, James Best, Richard Webb, and Buck Taylor. This episode is set in the state of Utah, with Kimble going by the fake name of ""Paul Beaumont"". It's a first-season ""Fugitive"" program, originally seen on ABC-TV on December 17, 1963. It was the thirteenth episode in the history of the series, and was directed by Jerry Hopper.

""Tightrope"", Fugitive episode #12, initially aired on network TV on Tuesday, December 3, 1963, during Season One of the series. Directed by actress Ida Lupino, who doubled as a film and television director when she wasn't in front of the cameras. She directed a total of three ""Fugitive"" episodes. ""Tightrope's"" guest cast includes the likes of Leslie Nielsen, Edward Binns, Jud Taylor, and Tom Palmer. .... This is the first episode in the series in which Kimble uses more than one alias -- he goes by both ""Harry Carson"" and ""George Paxton"" during this episode.

Viewers with very keen eyesight will spot a blooper in ""Glass Tightrope"". At one point during the episode, the familiar Richard Kimble ""Wanted"" poster is shown on screen, but there's an error in the text on the poster -- it says that Kimble is from ""Beloit, Wisconsin"" (instead of the correct Kimble birthplace of ""Stafford, Indiana"").

Interestingly, however, the series WAS, indeed, originally going to be set in the state of Wisconsin, thereby making this slight goof a bit more understandable in nature, and easier to forgive. When locations for the series were finally decided upon and scripted, the Wisconsin locale was changed to the Hoosier state of Indiana. (Part of the reason for this switching of hometown U.S. states perhaps might have been because the producers of the show felt that David Janssen didn't have enough of a Wisconsin-type accent to claim he was born in that state.)*

* = EDIT/ADDENDUM -- I later learned that the reason for the change was due to the fact that the state of Wisconsin did not have the death penalty (circa 1963). Therefore, the producers and writers of the series had to switch Dr. Kimble's home state (where the murder of Kimble's wife occurred) to a state that had the death penalty, since we know that Kimble, via the opening credits for each episode, was being transported by train to the ""Death House"" when he escaped.
