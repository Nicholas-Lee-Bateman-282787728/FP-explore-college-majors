If you are a TPB fan and love some drunk Lahey then you'll love this special.",1295481600,14,243,4.083333333333333
4260191,3,B00447853E,"I'm a huge fan of the TPB's and I purchased this video to complete my collection which would be my suggestion to anyone considering purchasing it. It's 47 minutes that feel twice as long and really drawn out. It just seems like the story never comes together on this video and everything is overshadowed by 45 minutes of drunk, loud and incomprehensible Jim Lahey. It's not a horrible video, just not one of their best.",1294876800,24,419,4.6
4260192,2,B00447853E,"I like trailor park boys. but this dvd is not worth 15 bucks its not not a movie at all, its more like 1 episode on a DVD its 47 min long and they leave you hanging for the ending. Total rip off!!!",1294704000,3,197,3.604651162790698

The junk cars, the dynamic between Mr. Leyhie and Ricky, Randy, and now, Baby Randy! Love the trailer park ambiance, and the various characters milling around.  I love it!",1378252800,,337,4.475409836065574
4260218,3,B00447853E,I seriously love the Trailer Park Boys series.  Its very funny and insightful to me.  I really dug getting all the side movies but I have to say this one is the worst.  The quality of the Blu Ray isn't a question to me.  Its produced quite well given the budget and the cameras they were filming on.  My problem is with the story.  Its not my place to say that creator of the series is wrong but it wasn't what I expected or was it?  This was supposed to be the last of the TPBs and it just seemed like a flat ending.  If that's what the director wanted then they did it perfectly.  It wasn't my favorite ending but as I said if that's the way it was supposed to go down its perfect,1377388800,,682,3.9558823529411766
4260219,5,B00447853E,"arguably the funniest of the movies since it manages to squeeze in so much in literally less than 1 hour you get

4260223,4,B00447853E,Too much money for the one episode you are actually getting. Its about four cents a minute.. thats insane to me,1375056000,,111,4.333333333333333

4260226,4,B00447853E,"As an American I really wish this show had caught on in the states.  Unfortunately Americans are all (well mostly) close minded, arrogant, and idiotic so nobody gave it the time of day.  But this really is a unique show Rob Wells and JP Tremblay created.  It's stereotypically Canadian with really good characters that provide more than just laughs.  After watching all the seasons and movies on Netflix this was the only episode, or special, that I did not see and it did not disappoint.  Unfortunately it is only 40 plus minutes long and for the price that is rough but it is low budget production so the price is understandable.  If you enjoy TPB than you have to see this and the only way is to buy at this time.  If you are new to the series I would recommend watching the movies (the second movie is the best in my opinion) or the tv episodes before buying this to see if you enjoy it or not.  Just watch out for the Sh*thawks!!!",1365465600,,935,4.333333333333333

4260236,4,B00447853E,I'm a T.P.B. fan and thoroughly enjoyed this flick.

It WAS just ""more of the same"".....but I think that's exactlly what TPB fans want.  That's what I want.  I'll keep watching whatever they come out with as long as they stick to the proven formula. Yeah, it would have been nice if it were twice as long.  But I'll take anything I can get from Treblay and Wells.  Leheay's last few lines in this movie definitly indicate that there will be more to come in the future.....damn, I hope so.

In this release, I find that the acting is a little lack lustre, and the storyline is running thin and tiresome.  Once again, it's Lahey against Ricky and Julian.  Lahey's alcoholism is becoming more ridiculous than funny.  It seems as though this episode has been rushed and is missing some chemistry.
