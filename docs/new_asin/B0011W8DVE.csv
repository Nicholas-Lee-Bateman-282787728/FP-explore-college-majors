8242792,2,B0011W8DVE,Should've paid attention to the label because this IS the worst drum instructional dvd ever.  Not much in the way of instruction.  Its more performance.  Quite useless.  No offense to Brain... great drummer with cool grooves.  You just didn't TEACH me anything!,1427760000,,261,5.119047619047619
8242793,5,B0011W8DVE,"When you first pick up this DVD from legendary drummer Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia (Primus, Guns N' Roses, Buckethead, Bootsy Collins and a ton more) you may be confused. That is only the beginning. While the cover is adorned with punctuation-challenged truths, semi-truths, and outright fabrications, it is hilarious. Example: ""After entering Nirvana, each of you will be ready to shoot a barking dog. I am, therefore, going to give you some hints on when to call Josh, so that you may keep up the tradition of The Green Light of Dogen."" At this point you may be asking yourself, ""But I thought this was an instructional DVD for playing the drums?"" And you're right, but it's so much more. And less.

When the DVD starts you may repeat the question ""What am I watching?"" several times. This is perfectly normal. The DVD is very stream-of-consciousness and pointedly random, but really does get around to the drums. There are numerous vignettes (my favorite of which involve Brain on a couch in a strange type of therapy, although Brain's visit to the Shiggar Fraggar is a close second.) Brain tries everything to find his center again, and determines that it all comes down to the 2 and 4. This is, naturally, where the drumming comes in, and interspersed through the running time are numerous epic jam sessions some of which feature Buckethead. There are also clips of Brain giving instruction to budding drummers at a school, and it's clear that not only does he know his stuff, but he's a great teacher as well. Other moments to look for are Brain buying a drum kit from a guy's garage (his transportation of it afterwards is classic if confusing,) a completely random limo ride full of unlikeable people, and DJ Hot Dog helping out in the studio. I enjoyed Brain discussing his inspirations (e.g. Neil Peart, Billy Cobham) and his more serious discussions of drumming, most of which are in the extras.

The extras on this DVD are plentiful. There's a piece on Brain's drums, a lengthy segment called ""Lost YMR Tapes"" which features Brain teaching the students in more detail, during which he presents a lot of great lessons and advice for beginning drummers (the students respond very well to him, and it's well worth watching if you're interested in drums.) The segment ""On the Road with Brain"" is short and not especially noteworthy. ""Furniture Shopping w/Richard Fortus"" is just about the creepiest thing I've ever seen in my life, and reminded me of a particularly cobweb-infested lost episode of ""Hoarders"" that never aired because the cleanup was deemed unwatchable. I found it fascinating as a part of the randomness of the most unique drum video ever made (without question.)

If you're into drums you'll love this DVD. If you're into random thoughts set to music, you'll love this DVD. If you're into breakdancing you'll love this DVD. (I'm not, but I overlooked the occasional breakdancing scenes as just a deliberate part of the amorphous structure of the DVD.) I had no idea what to expect from ""Brain Has Made The Worst Drum Instructional DVD Ever,"" but it surpassed my wildest expectations in ways I had never even considered.",1379116800,3,3138,4.839851024208566
8242794,4,B0011W8DVE,"So BRAIN is back with another hilarious, random and informative drumming video. If you liked SHREDDING REPIS ON THE GNAR GANR RAD you'll be able to enjoy this as well. Seems like BRAIN is very into making people understand that the 2 and 4 basic rock beat is all you need and IT'S TRUE.
Lots and lots of comical moments. Buckethead makes a couple appearances and the two create some epic jams! Lots of dancing. Lots of nunchucks and karate kicks.  There's conversations with monkey's. Brain buying a drumset from a garage sale and completly bashing the drums while the owner is in awe!
Brain goes into detail about his drum sets. Being a big fan of BRAIN i get lots of pleasure out of the feature.
I would say START WITH SHREDDING REPIS ON THE GNAR GNAR RAD and then buy this. Otherwise you might not understand the amazing person that is BRAIN!
Shred on!",1324339200,,855,4.480769230769231
