3534579,5,B001DLH20G,"I have been looking for this movie for a couple years. I started watching it on TV and got interrupted. I haven't had time to watch it yet, but I know I'm going to enjoy it.",1357171200,,173,3.8333333333333335
3534580,3,B001DLH20G,"This movie was one that makes you feel good in the end.  Throughout the movie each character had their own issues.  As they come together each person's selfishness has its own part in ruining the family get together.  When the family secret is revealed, each family member has to examine what part they have played in the dysfunction of the family.  But, all's well that ends well. Forgiveness, humility, and love win out in the end and the family ends up having a Christmas reunion that begins healing hearts and happiness doesn't seem out of reach.",1356739200,2,550,4.697916666666667
3534581,4,B001DLH20G,"A hilarious but heartwarming Christmas movie.  We all have family members that make Christmas stressful and challenging.  You'll see some of your family in this movie, but when it all ends we seem to always put things in perspective and have warm ;memories of that Christmas.",1355184000,,275,4.956521739130435
3534582,5,B001DLH20G,"I enjoy the ""Hallmark type"" Christmas movies, but they do become formulaic. While, this was billed a comedy, it really is more what a real life Christmas can be like for many families.  We have this idea that at Christmas time everything is supposed to be wonderful and unrealistic expectations make things worse.  It was good to see a Christmas movie about real life instead of a fantasy that none of us will achieve.",1353974400,,418,4.635135135135135
3534583,1,B001DLH20G,"I realize that this movie is a few years old, but I have it recorded on VHS. Every time I would watch it, I would feel seriously disturbed for this family. I came to Amazon to read reviews, wondering if I was being way too sensitive. I was glad to see that another person had the same opinion as me. If you are looking for a sad story about a very disfunctional family, then watch this movie. As far as I am concerned, this movie should not even be associated with Christmas. I won't be watching it again.",1328140800,,505,4.163265306122449
3534584,5,B001DLH20G,i just bought this christmas movie form amazon this movie is very good my whole family enjoyed it you can watch this movie any time of the year so if you see together again for the time buy it on amazon it is well worth the money enjoy.,1324944000,,236,3.9375
3534585,4,B001DLH20G,"I really enjoyed this movie, but be warned:  this is not a feel-good piece of Christmas fluff that everyone is used to seeing during the holiday season.  Christmas is only the backdrop upon which the family conflict is played out.  Having said that, however, a lot of families do go through major dramas during the holiday, so it is very believable that this can and does happen.
This movie can be viewed a a ""dark"" comedy, I suppose--and there are very funny moments:  the mom being way over the top on Christmas decorations; the grown kids behaving as children; the bewildered fiance who stumbles into the situation.  This is a very specific kind of comedy that some people do enjoy--if that's what you are expecting.  However, other people don't appreciate this kind of humor (especially if you are expecting sweeter fare).  So, just be aware of what you are getting into.
Having said all that, I really enjoyed it.  It was nice to get a break from more sappy Christmas TV movies (although I love some of those, too).  And the acting, all around, is superb, especially from the parents:  David Ogden Stiers and Julia Duffy.  They handle the comedic moments with ease and then are able to shift into the heavy drama just as quickly.
And, the ending of the movie is quite hopeful.",1321056000,2,1281,4.648888888888889
3534586,5,B001DLH20G,"I really enjoyed Together Again For The First Time.  I am a huge fan of David Ogden Stiers and I found him very funny in the movie.  He's come along way since I first saw him in the final episode of Touch By An Angel (I hadn't watched M*A*S*H at that stage).  I would like to congratulate Mr Stiers on an excellent performance and I find that he is still nice looking in his 60's.  Even though a few other people may not have enjoyed this movie, I surely did and I am so happy that I brought it.  I recommend it to others who love comedy.",1232409600,8,538,3.9906542056074765
3534587,4,B001DLH20G,"I didn't watch this movie expecting a Frank Capra classic, but I did enjoy it thoroughly.  It was a cute little film with a little drama, family stress and one serious twist to pull everything together.  The actors did a good job.  It occurs during the Christmas season but Christmas wasn't the focus.  It was really about the dynamic of bringing a blended family together.",1230595200,6,373,4.6923076923076925
3534588,1,B001DLH20G,"Movies are my life.  I love movies, any kind of movie (except reality...well, anything) yet I am still trying to figure out why anyone would even produce this one.  It is hands down the WORST so called Christmas movie I have ever watched.  I only got through the entire thing because I kept waiting for something good to happen, which by the way NEVER did, at least not until the end credits came.  It was not joyous, heartwarming or even remotely close to Christmas cheer.  Drugs, family despair and hate are not what I call a happy Christmas movie.  I never realized how normal my family was until investing two hours of my life, which unfortunately I will never get back, into this film so I guess I should thank the people who stupidly put the time and money into this.  So thank you and have a Merry Christmas.",1229299200,3,815,4.429530201342282

8294028,4,B001DLH20G,"This is one of those movies that has a little bit of everything, starts out as a comedy and then here comes all the drama and family dysfunction. The story of a controlling and manipulative  mom, Julia Duffy with 2 sons, and a dad David Ogden Stiers with 3 daughters and for both this is the second marriage. Son Roger is the comedian who can't stand his new sister who is a spoiled princess.  All the ""children"" are grown up or late teens. Great performances and lots of heart strings being pulled. A few secrets emerge in this first get together in 8 years. I did like it and love a good many of the characters.",1398470400,2,613,4.275862068965517

8294030,2,B001DLH20G,"The best part of the movie was that it ended.
EIther that or recalling the narcissistic beauty Stephanie Vanderkellen.
This movie, however, is a chick flick from deep in soap territory.",1387065600,,185,5.0
