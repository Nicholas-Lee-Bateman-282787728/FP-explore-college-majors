2365334,3,B000066JS1,"This is ""Arthur"" and I like each of the episodes, so I'm giving this three stars. But, overall, this DVD offering is lackluster because it's essentially a copy of the video version. There's no special features and despite the fact that it could hold so much more, there's only three episodes. If you'd rather buy video versions, then stick to it because there's nothing extra for you on the DVD.",1024012800,5,395,4.6571428571428575
2365335,4,B000066JS1,"Even though the shows are great and the quality is excellent.
It was somewhat disappointing not having more features on the DVD. I guess, I was half expecting to have Arthur and Company speaking french or spanish, or have some type of extra feature.
Except for getting a particular show on DVD, without having to Fast Forward or going through the entire program like you would on a tape, there wasn't much difference between DVD's and Tapes.",1023926400,5,441,4.740259740259741
