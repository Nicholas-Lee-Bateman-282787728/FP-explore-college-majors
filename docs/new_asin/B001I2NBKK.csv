8310400,5,B001I2NBKK,This Fight is great with Miguel Cotto boxing Antonio Margarito. I think Margarito is one of the toughest and strongest welterweights i can ever remember as far as being able to take punishment. Cotto must have felt like he was fighting a Zombie because nothing ever seemed to hurt him and Cotto is one of the Hardest punchers pound for pound in the sport. This fight is worth the money for sure. The fight is in english with Emanual Stewart calling the fight. All the 33 big rounds are exciting from start to finish with alot of big KOs.,1342828800,,537,4.434343434343434
8310401,4,B001I2NBKK,"Was Antonio Margarito cheating when he fought Miguel Cotto back on July 26, 2008? Chances are, we'll never know unless dude pulls a Mark McGwire and 'fesses up. But what was then Margarito's signature fight became clouded in controversy six months later when he took on Shane Mosley but was caught with a wet but already hardening substance in his hand wrappings on fight night. Mosley then went on to dominate Margarito and eventually knock him out in the 9th round. The boxing world was duly flabbergasted as most folks believed Margarito would walk thru Sugar Shane. I personally blame the loss on Margarito's effed-up mullet (what was up with that?).

But back to this DVD's featured fight. GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 15 presents Margarito vs. Cotto, the entire bout, with fight commentary provided by Jim Lampley and his HBO broadcasting crew. Hide the women and children! Despite the retroactive controversy, Margarito vs. Cotto is an instant classic and features eleven rounds of rugged, mean-intentioned exchanges. Compared to recent donnybrooks, this one falls in the same epic category as Vasquez/Marquez, the first Gatti/Ward, and Barrera/Morales, except that Margarito/Cotto isn't a trilogy. It wasn't quite - almost, but not quite - as relentlessly give and take as the jawdropping first war between Diego Corrales and Jose Luis Castillo.

This was one of the most anticipated fights of 2008 and one of the few that absolutely lived up to expectations. Another thing which factored into it was the long-established Puerto Rico vs. Mexico boxing rivalry. Two hard men pitting their will and grit and pride against one another and, going into this, it was really fascinating to see which one will wilt and cave in. Cotto clearly won the first half of the contest with his boxing skills and his quick, pinpoint attack. But Margarito, always a slow starter, simply kept taking Cotto's best shots and grinning, kept moving forward because dude is implacable like that. In the latter stages Margarito's pressure began to take its toll... and what happened happened.
