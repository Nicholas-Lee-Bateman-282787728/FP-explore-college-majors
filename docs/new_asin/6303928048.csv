Not really. But this came very close.

Retro style animation is beautiful. Music is beautiful and moving. Characters are likeable (this is the biggest difference between this and another great animation, GiantRobo (same original creator)). And when you finish the final DVD, you will realize that it's one long story, all connected in the end. And such a touching ending, closing is sad but completes the story. Finally, it's quite frank and honest regarding WWII (You have to watch it to understand). Strongly recommended!

* 5 stars should not be used lightly but I gave it to this wonderful animation because an animation doesn't get any better than this. Beautiful...",1171411200,2,714,5.033898305084746
