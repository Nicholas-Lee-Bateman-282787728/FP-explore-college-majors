7846418,1,6303365205,"I'll admit I'm a fan of a few of the other Emmanuelle movies, particularly the ones with Indonesian actress Laura Gemser. While they are certainly by no means at all great films, most of them do have a decent degree of sexiness to them to make the casual, undemanding viewer willing to excuse the thinness of the plot. 'Emmanuelle in Egypt' is not one of those films. In addition to having a go-nowhere, boring, next-to-nothing plot, 'Emmanuelle in Egypt' isn't even sexy. There's hardly even any nudity, and what little is present is fleeting and unarousing. The few sex scenes in the movie are limited and decidely non-sexy, and even if they were, they're over too quickly to allow time for anyone to be stimulated by them. Even the appearance of the lovely Laura Gemser (who I find to be very exotic and sexy ) can't save this pseudo-entry in the Emmanuelle series. I say pseudo because in this particular movie, Laura plays another character ------ not Emmanuelle ------ so it is therefore unrelated to and not part of the series of the other Emmanuelle films she appears in. This one is just a waste of time so skip this one. It is not one you want. None of the Emmanuelle films are big on plot or story, but if you want one that at least delivers on the sexiness and titilation, go instead with 'Emmanuelle in America', 'Emmanuelle in Bangkok', 'Emmanuelle Around the World', or 'Emmanuelle and the White Slave Traders'. All of these latter films also feature Laura and are much better at least as far as the sex and nudity are concerned.",1216166400,,1544,4.618181818181818
