2053543,2,B00020X9CO,"This salad bowl, shisch-kebab and mumbo-jumbo documentary is absolutely amazing: it makes no effort to place Dr. John, Dave Brubeck, Fats Domino, Duke Ellington, or Pinetop Perkins in their respective contexts...

In the end, we get rambling and pointless conversations (sitting alongside Pinetop Perkins, Jay McShann or Ray Charles the interviewer should get something fresh out of them...) and some sensational archive footage; my favorite is the great Jay McShann's interplay with Big Joe Turner, and Otis Spann is also great... Monk also, but that footage I have already seen (actually, Monk is one of the very few artists at least moderately explained in their context).

There is a lot of great and creative music in this film, but performances are cut off precisely when they catch steem, and cross-cutting between various artists is neither artistic nor informative in the musical sense...

It is interesting to remember Wim Wenders' ""Buena Vista Social Club"" - a documentary equally selfcentred as is Eastwood's ""Piano Blues"", but at least Wenders was attempting to give structure and meaning to pictures and sounds of the music it depicts. By the way, Wenders' contribution to Scorsese's ""Blues"" series is far superior to Eastwood's (which I say with sadness - I like Eastwood very much and many of the people he deals with have my warm musical affection, others I would like to now more about...).",1166659200,3,1408,5.139737991266376

2053545,5,B00020X9CO,"If your taste runs towards blues-based piano, watch this video. The ""blues"" title is (thankfully) used in the loosest, musically correct sense, and features blues, R&B, boogie woogie, jazz (Duke!), rock n' roll, and anything else that rolls up and down the blues scales. The video itself intersperses vintage footage with live performances. Musicians such as Ray (!), Pinetop Perkins, Dr. John, Jay McShann, and Dave Brubeck play next to an obviously awed Clint Eastwood. (It's worth the price of the video to watch the 70+ year old icon look like a 10 year old boy meeting his baseball heroes). There's no music theory mumbo jumbo; the music does the talking. Lots of playing, and occasional anecdotes coaxed out by Clint. About the only minus is the lack of start-to-finish performances. Great fun, definitely recommended.",1111968000,9,824,5.111111111111111
2053546,4,B00020X9CO,"Quite a good Documentary/Interview by Clint Eastwood. A great chance to see Clint in his real element, a frustrated Piano Player who couldn't quit his day job. For someone we are used to seeing so in command onscreen he seems at times nervous and obviously in awe of greats such as Ray Charles and Dr. John. Not a great facts and figures type presentation but fantastic to see more of the personalities dabble around on home and studio pianos telling Clint how they fell into playing and not a movie career. Some classic old footage used as reference only of the old school players and some re visited Prof. Longhair interviews. Not to be missed if you have Scorsese's collection.",1091232000,4,680,4.675

My boyfriend had never seen it, so I bought it, so that we could watch it together and I could ad it to my DVD collection.  If you are a blues fan and/or a Clint Eastwood fan, I think you will find it interesting.",1426204800,,283,3.8620689655172415

8019834,5,B00020X9CO,"Piano Blues DVD is an interview by Clint Eastwood who is a vintage blues/jazz player & historian, unknown to most people.  Clint Eastwood discusses the piano with several of the most famous pianists and has video/audio clips of deceased pianists who pioneered piano blues, as it evolved.

I thought I knew something about this topic, but discovered an impressive collection that is a historical masterpiece.  I have purchased extra copies for pianists friends who were amazed to discover that Clint Eastwood was heavily involved in this legendary collection of talent.

Some of those interviewed are Dr. John, Ray Charles, Marcia Ball and many others.  Many of the great ones are seen on video/audio clips throughout this DVD.  Read Amazon's product information for a longer list of performers on this DVD.",1371772800,,806,5.161538461538462
8019835,5,B00020X9CO,"If you like the piano - clint eastwood - blues - ray charles - etc...you'll like this dvd.  It's interesting information - lots of names & stories for old piano players who played the blues & made it into an art form...very amazing playing.  lots of old footage - plus interview with living piano players, dr.john, marcia ball, etc..  very enjoyable.",1275350400,,350,4.704918032786885
8019836,5,B00020X9CO,"The product description notes that masters like Cole,Tatum,OP,Brother Ray and Dr. John are here,and...others. One of the others is Pete Jolly. Pete Jolly was an LA based pianist. Lots of studio work on soundtracks like ""Bullitt"",""Butch Cassidy"" and TV's ""M*A*S*H"",so literally millions have heard his work. He also spent over 40 years playing in LA area clubs(most notably Donte's)with the same drummer Nick Matinis, and bassist Chuck Berghofer. I suspect that is how Clint became aware of Jolly. Jolly could swing,as Clint shows you in the film. An equal to the noted stars in the story? Yes. Jolly may have blushed,but Eastwood knew a master when he heard him.",1254528000,,662,5.08256880733945
8019837,3,B00020X9CO,"Otis Spann, Professor Longhair, Marcia Ball...the august group list goes on and on. For the blues archivist, how about color footage of Fats Domino on the Mike Douglas Show in 1970? For Ray Charles fans, apparently one of his last filmed appearances, playing some early-career Blues, ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand"".
Clint Eastwood is the host, not exactly dressed for the occasion, and not really looking relaxed until he gets his chance to tickle the ivories. By cutting that mess out, we may have had room for Fats' complete performance.
As one reviewer very astutely put, the clips are rare and beyond valuable to History and Culture, but they are mixed together with no real analysis of the diversities of style, and no programming ""flow"" - too much, too fast. The professional packaging aside, and the pretensions of the series aside, what we have here is a warm tribute to the Blues, with many, many segments on under-represented artists.
Somewhere along the way, I saw Little Richard's name listed as part of the program. If his *music* is in there, I don't recall it. Richard did ""Slippin' and Slidin' (Peepin' and Hidin')"" on the above mentioned TV show that Fats' appeared on, and this uptempo would have been a perfect example of an old art form underlying a new art form.",1195344000,7,1282,4.7792792792792795
8019838,5,B00020X9CO,"This film by Clint Eastwood is the best blues Piano DVD out there. Can you beat Clint Eastwood talking to Ray Charles at a Grand Piano followed by beautiful (what looks like) 60's film of Ray playing ""What'd I say"". Then they discuss boogie woogie and theres some amazing archive clips of great Piano players I've never even heard of (Martha Davis in particular is astonishing).

Other great players featured include Dave Brubeck who plays some great stuff (which is blues influenced rather than pure blues) but I'm not complaining! Clint looks on in amazement... This leads onto a discussion of Art Tatum (again not really blues - but one the greatest players ever).
A fabulous clip of Oscar Peterson absolutely smokin' from Jazz 625 is worth catching as well.

Back to the blues - Ray Charles plays a couple of choruses of great solo Blues. For purists Otis Spann is perhaps the highlight, a pianist who played with Muddy Waters. Here he is featured in a trio, playing and singing with great passion. Other well known artists featured are Dr John, Professor Longhair, Pinetop Perkins and Jay McShann.

This really is an eclectic collection, but I think theres something for everyone here. Jazz and Blues Piano fans will all enjoy this.",1189123200,16,1237,4.8254716981132075
