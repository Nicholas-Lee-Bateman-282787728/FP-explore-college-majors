6788936,3,B00P80Y2IS,"Ray Jenkins (Angus Sampson) repairs TVs and is a bit of a dullard. In 1983 while the Royal Perth Yacht Club was giving a yachting lesson to their American counterparts, Ray wins a trip to Thailand. Ray's stepfather (Geoff Morrell) has some gambling debts and Ray reluctantly agrees to act as a mule to pay said debts. Ray swallows 20 condoms filled with heroin and gets nailed at the border. He is locked in a motel room until he releases his bowels. With an attorney (Georgina Haig) attempting to spring him, Ray is in a race against biology.

This is an interesting low budget film. Most of the ""action"" takes place in a motel room. There is stuff going on around him, such as the drug dealers reaction and that of his parents. The film is a crime drama. The ""comedy"" aspect is not due to any kind of humor or irony, but simply because of the crudeness of the subject matter.

Okay film for someone who watches a lot of crime dramas.

6788937,5,B00P80Y2IS,"A rare gem of a movie and definitely worth watching.

The world needs more Angus Sampson (the main character).  His body/face acting will absolutely make you appreciate your next bowel movement.  Hugo Weaving was only lightly used, but very entertaining in all of his scenes.

Overall, it was great to contrast this movie against typical Hollywood fare.  So many differences in casting, shots, sound, etc. and The Mule still comes across as a polished piece of storytelling.",1417824000,3,474,5.103896103896104
6788938,5,B00P80Y2IS,"I saw this movie on a whim because my new favorite actress (Georgina Haig) was in it. Much to my surprise this movie turned out to be a gem in the rough! The acting alone was stupendous especially from Angus Sampson who plays the central character, give him an award. Also, the interaction between Georgina and Hugo Weaving was priceless! This movie is high on the laughing and gagging factor (simultaneously). I totally recommend it unless you are squeamish about certain bodily functions",1417651200,,489,4.903614457831325

It is tense at times, often gross but always captivating. A slow-burn type of movie so don't expect a lot of action.",1422144000,,293,4.25
6788945,3,B00P80Y2IS,"Whats it about?

In 1983, a meek Australian footballer (Angus Sampson) is detained by local law enforcement for seven days, until he passes the heroin he is smuggling in his stomach.

What did I think?

For the first 45 minutes, the film is a dark comedy with a hapless, loveable hero under serious pressure. After that, things go from strangely funny to just strange, because we spend roughly as much time in the affairs of the no-good cops and crooks around him. Theres some nice period touches, with high-panted outfits and TVs tuned to the Americas Cup, to create a muddy feel of middle-class Australia. Its also stacked with fine performances from the likes of Hugo Weaving, John Noble and Noni Hazelhurst. On the whole, though, its a grubby crime caper that doesnt have much humor, and not much intrigue either.",1422144000,,817,4.780141843971631
6788946,5,B00P80Y2IS,"Watched today. It is Very clever. Very well
Made. Completely took me by surprise at just about every turn. The acting is on point and the screenplay very smart. Always enjoy discovering films and this one is super fun. Had to look away at times but was totally engrossed and at a few moments grossed all at the same time!

The film is Australian. Worth a repeat watching. I know I missed a lot of clues and lines due to grimacing and laughter. Totally empathetic to the mule and the entire community of characters are richly memorable. The synth (80s) music is so tense and the design world class too!

Like I said, demands a second viewing.

For those who like ensemble, tense, crime capers. Less Guy Ritchie more Coen Bros. Lotsa quirk and masculinity.

Very unique story and utterly memorable!",1421798400,,796,4.624113475177305

6788948,4,B00P80Y2IS,"A little gem from our beloved Aussie cousins, alternately hilarious, harrowing, and touching tragedy, masterfully shot set-pieces from 1983, some Aussie pros hitting on all 8.  OK, OK that's personal, subjective, maybe The Mule just aint gonna be your cuppa, but do stick around for the scene, early on, wherein we are introduced to a Thai sex club/bar, maybe a 5-second shot, featuring a club stripper/dancer who may be struggling with obesity, and a female impersonator, seated at the bar, who looks to be aggrieved with clinical depression.  A hoot.  Historical side-note, kids:  the Aussies love us Yanks, and we Yanks love them right back; during World War II, the Japanese were bearing down on Australia, full-tilt, to occupy her for raw materials.  The Aussies didn't stand a chance.  Our Navy intervened with (if memory serves) The Battle Of The Coral Sea.  We lost a lot of brave GIs in that fight, and the Aussies will always love us for it.  And we love them because they are just so damned cool.",1417910400,,1007,4.813953488372093

8686744,5,B00P80Y2IS,"A nave man transporting lethal narcotics in his stomach is detained by the police. Alone and afraid, the mule makes a desperate choice -- to defy his bodily functions and withhold the evidence...literally. First of all, I cannot believe that with the content of this movie I am going 5 stars. Hugo Weaving is the cop and he wants the evidence in Angus Sampson's belly. In the original arrest he is held for 7 days under constant guard. The cops then get extensions all the while Angus is fighting and fighting not to....well you know. I have to say there is something appealing and interesting and complicated in this movie that really held my attention, don't dismiss this because you think you know what this is about, give it a try, great little Australian movie, I have to say that the Australians really know how to make movies and take chances doing that too. Great acting, direction and writing.....a daring idea that works.",1515801600,,931,4.717791411042945
8686745,4,B00P80Y2IS,"This movie is one of those foreign productions that slowly pulls you in and makes you beg for more. It's simple yet complex, a bit of a bore starting out but a thrill to watch once the waiting game begins. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a crime/drama so much where the suspense is centered around a guy taking or not taking a dump. No, it's not really a comedy, but there's definitely some comical moments. And then there's one gut grabbing scene...............Whew! Classic!

The Mule takes the simple life of a simple guy and turns it upside down when he naively agrees to smuggle drugs in his stomach. He looks simple, talks simple and acts simple, but don't let simple fool you. With a crunchy supporting cast of undesirables it's easy to root for the underdog in this movie.",1485043200,,780,4.571428571428571
8686746,4,B00P80Y2IS,"The Mule is quite a good dark mild comedy movie revolving around a not the brightest guy in the world football player who due to his own stupidity is detained in 1983 by customs at Melbourne Airport with $10 000 dollars worth of heroine inside him.  The majority of the story is set in a rundown airport hotel room where the police are growing impatient, and lessening in ethics, waiting for him to use the bathroom so they can have their evidence.  Of course his public defense lawyer wants the time period someone can be kept in custody without charge strictly enforced. Can our antihero hold on for that duration?  Outside the hotel room there's a violent crime world story going on which helps keeps the viewer interested, much more so than the America's Cup footage on TV screens in the background.  Not real sure what they add, other than reminding us this is set in 1983, when perhaps there was less scrutiny of police behaviour, maybe less time for being detained and other plot aspects needed to be somewhat plausible than if they occurred today.  Or perhaps the America's Cup race is the ""true story"" part that this movie is based on.

It's pretty decent film but I had a few unanswered questions after it was over that were never answered. You might be able to work out some spoilers obviously by reading on. What was the mother trying to achieve with her plan? Had she done a deal with the cop that we didn't see who didn't eat the chops so thought she was helping her son?  Otherwise it just made no sense as if he passes the drugs, he's going to jail for a long time.  Or did she just naively believe he was a good boy so had to be innocent and for whatever reason was constipated or had stage fright or something, so just wanted it over?  What evidence did they have at the end to raid the drug king pin guy's place?  All that Hugo's character had was a Polaroid photo with family members scratched out, crosses on them.",1482969600,,1935,4.425352112676056
8686747,4,B00P80Y2IS,"This is a really well made film; the plot surrounds Ray who is a bit on the slow side. He plays a bit of footie at his local club and mends electrical goods for a living. Still at home with his parents who are having financial problems. So when he gets made an offer by one of his closest mates to earn some easy cash  he decides to go for it.

It involves a trip to Thailand and more importantly a return trip with a rather full stomach. What follows is a story that had me totally gripped. There are some truly disgusting scenes here too so really make sure you are nowhere near food while this is on  and for a while after.

The acting is all top notch - Ray is played brilliantly by Angus Samson (Fargo) but the real plaudits have to go to the perfectly horrible cop  Det. Tom Croft played by the superb Hugo Weaving (Mystery Road) who oozes bad cop in a way that balances sleaze with old school policing and the tension is pounding for most of thisthriller  completely recommended.",1458172800,,986,4.245989304812834

8686749,3,B00P80Y2IS,"THE MULE is a mixed bag - an Australian film aimed at chronicling some very bad decision making by a nice-guy-turned-drug-courier by friends, opportunity, and circumstances.  The hang dog protagonist is played by Angus Sampson, with a face only the owner of a basset hound would love. Sampson's character is coerced into smuggling drugs in his colon from Thailand to Australia.

Naturally he gets caught in customs and the  movie basically grinds to a halt while day after day of hotel confinement by the cops adds to his (and the viewer's) displeasure.  I've never spent 45 minutes of my life waiting for someone to relieve himself onscreen, and although the story line is original and it's well acted, the pacing suffers as the claustrophobic hotel scenes are ploddingly played out.  Because the story payoff is when and where will Angus relieve himself, it's kind of an anticlimax when it comes (as well as messy).

Hugo Weaving is unspectacular in a supporting role as a drug agent.  Occasional violence, language, and some graphic and borderline repulsive excretory visuals.  Mildly recommended for acting and a good story.",1432684800,,1128,5.059459459459459
