8602524,3,B0041H0GIO,"First, the good news: 'In the Wake of the Bounty,' while nothing cinematically exceptional for its era (stiff acting, flat script, static camera work, etc.), is a pretty fascinating little piece of history-- not only for its content, which gives slight treatment to the oft-told mutiny and instead focuses on Christian (Flynn, in his big-screen debut) and company's struggle to survive on Pitcairn Island, but for the fact that it was produced by Expeditionary Films, and as such was to be the first in a series of travel films 'depicting strange incidents, strange places and strange peoples,' according to the movie's scrolling preface.  I haven't been able, as of this writing, to find any other titles released by that outfit but plan to research its fate in future.  The second feature, 'Captain Kidd,' is a light but amiable pirate yarn notable mainly for Charles Laughton's rich performance as the titular 17th century blackguard (although Randolph Scott, John Carradine, Gilbert Roland and Reginald Owen are all in good form, as well).

Now the bad news:  Picture and audio quality on both films are spotty, only fair-to-poor in most instances, and PR's disc is a DVD-R, which should be mentioned in the product description as this inferior format can present playability problems (mine plays fine as of two viewings).  I haven't yet picked up a copy of ITWOTB under another label (there are two or three on the market) for comparision, but there is a much cleaner print of CK available on American Home Treasures' 'Legendary Pirate Movies,' released in 2002.

Note to parents:  ITWOTB-- in a classic example of pre-code liberality-- contains several brief scenes of nudity in the form of topless native gals.  Very innocuous stuff, of course, but it's there front-and-center.

Update: I viewed another public-domain print (St. Clair Vision) of ITWOTB and it's in even worse shape than PR Studios'.",1302307200,10,1906,5.083333333333333

8602526,5,B0041H0GIO,"In the Wake of The Bounty is interesting firstly becuase it's Errol Flynn's first movie role. He plays a young and handsome Fletcher Christian, a man who gave up everything to be with the native woman he loved. But what's also amazing, this being a true story, the second part is a travel documentary showing the island Christian and the other mutineers settled with their Tahitian women. This island, Pitcairn, still has decendents of the mutineeers living on it today. It is amazing considering the small population and the size of the island, truly an isolated island existence not unlike Cast Away, but with a group. The film also shows where the Mutiny was sunk, amazing to see.
Captain Kidd is a classic pirate movie with the magnificent Charles Laughton as the title pirate who poses as a legitimate captain in order to get to his buried treasure and do away with those who also lay claim to it, like John Carradine's character. Randolph Scott is great as the mysterious Mr. Mercy. A most see.",1283385600,7,1000,4.72
