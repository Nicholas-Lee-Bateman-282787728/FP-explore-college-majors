525138,4,6302967953,"I was very pleased with this tape, it alternates between arm work and step aerobics.  The moves are pretty easy to pick up and easy to follow.  Kelly does a lot of bicep and tricep work and I can feel it.  I wish there was some more squats or leg work. The only disappointment in the video is the ab work - not very good - usually I pop this tape out and do Tamilee or Kathy's ab work.",1031616000,,385,3.848101265822785
525139,5,6302967953,"The Set: bright and cheery, from the whitewash hardwood floors, side walls are white, and the background has wide painting of brown mountains that reaches from wall to wall. Soothing if you notice it....
The instructor: She has an accent... but during the workout you don't even notice it... only during the intro... there are approx 6 people doing the workout with her... most are wearing one piece top and shorts, one with a bare midrift. She is formidable... her cueing is very good... every tiny little thing is explained, down to how to tilt your step... LOL
Music: appropriate, good, seems to match the workout very well.
The workout progression: Total approx 60 min.
warm up - 7min
Step aerobics - 5 min
Circuit weightwork - 10 min
Step aerobics - 5 min
Circuit weightwork - 10 min
Step Aerobics - 5 min
step cool down - 3 min
Abwork - 6 min
Back lifts and leg lifts 1-2 min
Stretch - 3 min
The weightwork: She does them all with an elastic band
but one and at times two of the students use hand weights..... (I used handweights and was fine!)
Both 10 min Circuit weightwork sessions contain these moves:
Press arms forward w/ not deep squats
Side lateral
Militaries
French Press
Triceps dips off box
Bent Row
Upright Rows
Biceps Curls
Push ups
Lunge off box w/ Biceps curls then rows
Slow Lunge w/ one arm rows
The Step Choreography: is very basic... in fact beginners will pick it up immediately...(basic step, basic lifts, lunges, some propulsion) and those who have two left feet like me... a lot of continuous not too fast repetitions.... but the weightwork breaks it up and you don't get bored...
Film quality: I guess good... very clear.
Equipment needed: A step, two pairs of dumbells or 3 depending on your level, or a rubber Power-flex band.
This tape is definitely what it says a Circuit Training tape....",1005436800,52,1823,4.612307692307692
525140,4,6302967953,"I really like Keli Roberts workout. It will leave you sweating every time you do it and it will give you a good feeling after your done doing it. If you are a beginner, it will leave breathless as well the first few times. If you like a challenge, go a head and get it. It's great. I'm getting ready to purchase another one of her tapes, that's how much I like her workout.",967680000,11,373,4.054054054054054
525141,3,6302967953,"This video is well done however I am really looking to review Keli's kickbutt combat which I am in the middle of watching and had to take a break from.  I'm having difficulty watching the female to Keli's left.  I  cannot believe how awful her form is. Is she there to demonstrate the  incorrect way to kick, punch, etc.?  I expect to see correct demonstration  on a video.  Kelly is awesome as usual but as 16 year group fitness  instructor I found it so distracting to watch the young woman, I wanted to  jump in and correct her or have the person filming stop and inform Kelly.",949017600,4,580,4.345794392523365
525142,3,6302967953,"Keli Roberts puts together a tough, complete aerobic and toning workout with this tape. While the moves themselves are not too complex, the cues leave something to be desired. She tends to repeat the same moves ad  nauseum, but the step segments only last 8 minutes at a clip, so it's not  too tough to endure. The toning with resistance is super-effective and  tough; you will feel muscles you forgot you had. The warm-up and cool down  are okay, but there is a serious lack of leg stretching at the end. You  will need to work on your hip flexors, rotators, hamstrings and quads on  your own and give a little more time to your shoulders. Otherwise, very  effective.",948153600,18,668,4.563025210084033
7832589,5,6302967953,Excellent workout video!!.. did both of her videos back in the day...music is pretty good as well just wish it was on dvd...highly recommend,1485475200,,140,4.875

7832591,4,6302967953,"I received the videotape in a timely manner.  However, the jacket and the tape didn't match.  The actual tape was Keli Robert's ""The Ultimate Step Workout"" but the sleeve for the videotape indicated ""Total Body Circuit Training Workout"".  Since I enjoy this step workout tape and considering the price I paid, I'm not going to sweat what I believe was an honest mistake.",1264982400,,370,4.841269841269841
7832592,5,6302967953,"I am a Keli Roberts fan, and my favorites are this video and her step video.  My biggest fear is that the tapes will give way OR the video player will go out of use.  Then what will I do?",1245888000,,187,3.65
7832593,5,6302967953,"I love Keli Roberts.  Her workouts are always effective, fun, and challenging.  When I use this one, I feel like I have the whole gym in my livingroom.  You can use free weights in place of the bands, but the bands make it feel like you are actually using the cables in a gym.  I started noticing definition in my upper body after one week!  Highly recommended.  Like Billy Blanks, Keli Roberts has never let me down!",1232236800,,417,4.35064935064935
7832594,5,6302967953,"This is a great way to burn calories and gain muscle tone.  It's broken down into cardio and strength sections, so you never get tired of repetitions.  It's over before you know it and is more fun than work.",1167955200,,207,4.282051282051282
7832595,5,6302967953,"This is my favorite video right now- I love running outside in the summer but I needed something other than the boring treadmill for the winter.  Of the eight or so videos I now own, this is the best all around work-out.  The time flies by and I finish feeling like I worked my entire body.  It's broken up into segments so you step for a while, use the resistance band for a while, more step, more resistence, followed by the most intense step segment.  My arms and thighs look much more toned.  Keli is an excellent instructor because she knows what to say to keep you motivated and she doesn't have any fancy footwork- its all very easy to follow.  I also enjoy her other step tape and I wish she had more videos!!",1107302400,6,717,4.274074074074074
7832596,5,6302967953,"If you like Keli Roberts Ultimate Step, you'll love this video. Even if you don't like Keli Roberts Ultimate Step, you'll love this one, because it is 10 times better! Like Reebok Circuit Challenge, this video offers a circuit training workout that combines step aerobics with resistance training in between. The Reebok Circuit Challenge is made up of short intervals: a minute of step, a minute of resistance, and so on. It's very fast-paced as a result. Keli Roberts Real Fitness--Circuit Training Workout has longer intervals. There are three sections of step that lasts from 6-10 minutes. The first and second segments are followed by resistance training for about the same amount of time. It's therefore not as fast-paced as the Reebok video but it is still very effective and doesn't drag. Keli's cueing is perfect and I was able to follow the workout almost without a stumble the first time I tried it. The step segments use the step in a vertical position which is a great change from most other step videos. The second segment of resistance offers some of the most effective exercises for the shoulders I've used! Keli uses a stretch band for these exercises. I have dumbbells and had no problems completing all the exercises. One of the background steppers was using hand-held weights, so the elastic band is not required. Following the workout, you get about ten minutes of abdominal crunches using the step in a slanted position. I find this ab workout more effective than the one used in Keli Roberts Ultimate Step. It also does not have the silly meditative final cool down at the end that Ultimate has. Keli Roberts Real Fitness is one of the best videos I've tried. I also recommend Cherfitness: A New Attitude. Keli is the instructor of this workout and, albeit it is very long at an hour and twenty minutes, it is a very thorough and enjoyable workout.",1046304000,29,1870,4.792569659442725
7832597,5,6302967953,"Keli Roberts is one of my favorite instructors. And in this video, every muscle in your body is challenged to one degree or another, which to me is what's really important.  Not to mention that it's so much fun! I like the way Keli is always making sure you're doing each and every move correctly.  I will definitely be doing this one on a regular basis, right along with other videos that maybe put more emphasis on abs, for a complete and well-rounded workout.  Good job, Keli!",1037145600,7,479,4.482758620689655
7832598,4,6302967953,"As a person who has been working out with exercise videos for over seven years, I have grown quite picky with the selection of tapes that are out there. So, after seeing Keli in Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout, I decided to give one of her videos a try. At first, I thought the choreography was a little confusing on the first two tries, but I have to say, WOW, was my heart rate up there! It has been a habit of mine to ALWAYS wear a heart rate monitor during all workouts, and this workout really kept my heart rate up there. Unlike a lot of videos out there, she starts the workout in about two minutes of the tape running, which is great 'cause you don't have to fast-forward through a long and drawn out intro. The stretches she uses are fantastic; I used to be much more limber prior to giving birth to my daughter last year. I guess to cut down on time, I have been skipping the stretches, but have added them back in again about a month ago; Keli's stretches really do work well. Honestly, I would say give the tape at least two or three tries so you can get the choreography down; the overall benefits of the workout are very challenging and you will not be disappointed.",1034035200,5,1181,4.276785714285714
