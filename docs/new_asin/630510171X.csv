980204,5,630510171X,"This movie is probably one of my favorite movies ever for Christmas. No, it probably doesn't have the best story line or even the best production. But as a huge fan of westerns and a huge fan of A Christmas Carol, I thought the middle ground where these two met was great. I would recommend this movie to anyone, although hard to get your hands on(I searched for 2 years trying to get the DVD),it is worth the effort to find it. It's wonderful to have it in my collection now. The ending is quite magical and the overall theme is good things can change bad people.",1098403200,12,564,4.280373831775701
980205,1,630510171X,"Much as I love all things Scrooge, this New-Age through-the-corral spin on Dickens leaves so much to be desired it utterly fails.  Palance's cheating Western gambler, Scrooge is far too over-the-top to be believeable even without the continuity, pacing and script problems that plague the film, not to mention a supporting cast straight out of your local high school's annual butchering of Our Town.  But aside from a weak storyline that for the most part ignores Dickens altogether, the lamest aspect of this film is the characterizations themselves -- a bumbling, spineless Cratchit and simpering wife; a cloying Tiny Tim who breaks into unconvincing peals of faux-tuburcular coughing at the drop of every dramatic hat; an ineffectual nephew-cum-sheriff wearing a ridiculous bell-boy's hat; the award for Worst Makeup on a Dead Marley (although the director mercifully changes the dead man's name to Marlow -- perhaps to avoid lawsuit) along with about a dozen or so other badly-drawn and generally useless characters who have no Dickensian cognates at all.  After the Three Ghosts have done muddying up any possible rhyme or reason to the relationships on-screen and the viewer has consigned the entire cast to perdition together, there is a finale at once so syrupy as to cause diabetes in lab rats and less believeable than an Iraqi disarmament report.  In short: avoid this stinker at all costs -- its only redeeming value is how much better some of the 2- and 3-star Scrooge attempts appear by contrast.",1043625600,3,1510,5.101214574898785

980207,3,630510171X,"I know I am a sucker for pert near anything western. But I did enjoy Jack Palance as Ebeneezer in this remake of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"". Definitly has an old west touch to it.",938736000,13,188,4.25
980208,3,630510171X,"Okay, so the first thing I said while watching this film was ""So it's not Academy Award material"".  No matter.  I've seen many versions of Dicken's Christmas Carol.  This one was novel and original, and that's  saying something.
 . . . So for acting (especially on the part of the  extras and bit parts) and the casting (of the female bit parts, stock  hollywood filler types as opposed to real people) this film gets low marks.  But for novelty and innovation this film garners the extra star.  The  Christmas Future sequence was especially creative.  Ebeneezer didn't look  at his own gravestone at some indeterminate time in the future -- He saw  (and tried vainly to prevent) himself in a gunfight that would be happening  the next day...  And even that did not turn out in an obvious manner.
 .  . . Palance does an excellent job as Ebeneezer, and it's good to see Rick  Schroeder show up again after so many years.  He's not Ford or Pheonix or  Murray, but he's alright.",926812800,9,976,4.563953488372093

980629,1,630510171X,"It's an interesting idea--transport ""A Christmas Carol"" to the old West.  It might have worked, but this version emphatically doesn't.
Rick Schroeder is great (probably a big reason the film got made).  However, his affiliation with the Mormon church, and their backing of this sanitized version of the old west are what do this film in.  Even the villains in this piece watch their language with the laughably bad dialogue full of expletive substitutes like ""darn"" and ""gosh dang"".  While I'm happy to watch a family film as easily as I can watch those for more mature audiences, it just stretches credibility to see the old west portrayed in such an absolutely ridiculous manner.  There has to be some believability.  This film doesn't have it.
Besides Schroeder, Jack Palance is a little too over the top as Ebenezer and several minor roles are poorly played.  One suspects a limited budget with the hiring of sub-standard actors for the lesser roles.
The fact that this is never re-run on television says volumes about the poor quality of the production (given that almost every other version of Christmas Carol comes back on TV every year).",1321056000,,1145,4.901554404145077

980631,2,630510171X,"A very unusual re-telling of a Charles Dickens classic, ""Ebenezer"" is a tale about Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Jack Palance), a mean-spirited crook living in the Old West. For him, just spitting out ""Bah humbug"" is not enough. The first thing this cigar-smoking, gun-toting Scrooge does in the made-for-TV production is cheat money out of a young, dashing cowboy Sam (Rick Schroder) before beating and kicking him out of the saloon.

This 1997 Western version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" loosely based on the original book, is much different from any other adaptations you may have seen before, but ""different"" doesn't always mean ""good."" This Wild West re-telling of Scrooge is rather pointless, neither inspiring nor funny. This is not Alastair Sim's ""Carol,"" not Blackadder's Christmas Carol, either.

As a drama ""Ebenezer"" never captures the spirit of its source material. What Scrooge does here, when young and old, is much worse than any other Scrooges in the film history, nothing you can forgive and forget simply because he becomes a ""good"" man. In short his spiritual transformation isn't credible enough.. Moreover, we are supposed to believe that Ebenezer is a deadly gunman in the town, but Jack Palance's portrayal of Scrooge just doesn't convince. The film's drama never becomes too serious, but it is seldom involving.

Still the film could have been better had the director treated the material in a more tongue-in-cheek manner. However, director Ken Jubenvill misses almost every opportunity to make the film more engaging and amusing, having Palance and other actors play their characters too straight. You need some wit or humor in this story, especially the part of the visitations of the first two Spirits, but even the veteran actor's performance is compromised by the heavy-handed direction.

Certainly ""Ebenezer"" is one of the most unique adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" - maybe too unique for its own good. After all, why does this has to be a Western?",1264464000,,1977,5.130434782608695
980632,4,630510171X,"I recently obtained a new VHS packaging for EBENEZER, the 1997 production and western adaptation for A CHRISTMAS CAROL. One of the reasons
I wanted this one is the fact long time bad boy Jack Palance was playing the title role, and I wanted to see how the familiar story would turn
out as a western. I don't know why they don't bring this out on DVD, but I guess because maybe many other folks didn't like it. I personally found
Palance's Ebenezer a true genuine difference in this telling of the old Christmas Classic.  It is superb; sometimes a bit hammy, but I guess the rest of the
cast decided to have some fun in their respective roles. It's a different and refreshing change to the old familiar story.",1262995200,3,708,4.446153846153846
980633,5,630510171X,"I find it hard to believe anyone would belittle this movie, or give it less than four stars.  As far as I'm concerned, anyone who gives this movie less than four stars, or disparages it, lacks enough appreciation for the arts of acting and cinema to be critiquing them.  This is one of the most unique, innovative, and well-made versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" ever produced!  There's a reason why Jack Palance was such a marketable actor, may he R.I.P.

Jack Palance stars as a wild, wild western version of Ebenezer Scrooge that makes all the other Ebenezers I've seen seem like saints by comparison.  Truly a bad ""hombre,"" he is a liar, a poker playing cheater, a thief, a whoremonger, and a cold-blooded killer!

This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is a unique story which could stand on its own merit, with plenty of subtle and not-so subtle references to the original ""Carol.""

Although it's not quite as vulgar as the premium television series ""Deadwood,"" it did remind me of it, due to its brutality and subtle obscenity, as well as its gold rush era, Western theme and flavor. Parental guidance suggested!

If you like Christmas movies, Jack Palance vehicles and/or Westerns, this is a must-see and a ""might-as-well-buy,"" because you're probably going to watch it over and over again, and catch something new in it each time!",1232841600,2,1334,4.794759825327511

I really like Jack Palance and have seen him in many Christmas movies in his later years.  I probably have all of them. I watch Christmas movies year round and would recommend to those who just love Christmas Carol related movies and Christmas itself!!

980636,5,630510171X,I have watched this movie yearly for many years...my VHS was about to give out when the DVD came out. I watched it in DVD this year. I really enjoy this movie. Most highly recommended.,1166227200,3,184,4.285714285714286
980637,5,630510171X,"First of all in honor of Mr. Jack Palance, I would like to take the time to say how I appreciated his work since I first saw him in the movie ""Shane"" many years ago. Mr. Palance having passed away this very month, November 10, 2006 is a great loss to the industry and his fans. He is missed. My condolences to his family and friends.

 Now, on to the movie. Although some aspects of the Dickens story are definately presented, they are used as a base for the film and not its entire plot. Set in the old west we find Ebenezer, a bitter old money grubbing cheat, owning a saloon and cheating others, namely Rick Schroder. Cheating him out of his money, homestead, and ultimately even his horse, Samuel Benson (Schroder, tries to convince others that he had been cheated. That night the three spirits appear as in the classic version, showing Scrooge his past, the present, and his possible future along with that of Tim Cratchitt.

Of course Ebenezer has a huge change of heart and the scene of him trying to join in to the festivities via a play where is is attempting to portray father christmas is most touching. As Ebenezer becomes flustered and a look of regret crosses his face Tim comes to his side and begins to sing with him. It is a very moving moment.

Amy Locane did and excellent job in her role as Erica Marlowe, the love interest of Samuel (Schroder). Her smile alone is enough to light the scenes.

I won't give away any more of the film for those who haven't seen it but in my opinion it is wonderfully entertaining and progresses the message within Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" beautifully.

This movie is now alongside my other Christmas classics. It is watched each and every year multiple times.

Quotes from the movie:

Scrooge says to Ghost of Christmas Future, ""I've already met the other two nuts.""

As Scrooge walks down the walkway he meets carolers singing Away in A Manger, ""I'll send you away to a manger!""

Ghost of Christmas Past asks if he kept his promise of returning the  money Mr. Fezziwig, Scrooge says, ""Ya know, I don't like you. I don't like you at all. And another thing"" Ghost ""Blah blah blah"".",1164499200,5,2136,4.493540051679586
