8202535,5,B000RULUUC,"Great product for beginning photographers!

I recently got a very gently used Canon D30. All I've had is the ""point and shoot"" variety until now. I'm very new to photography and really know nothing to very little about all of the functions of this camera. If you're reading this review, you either have this camera or are looking to get one.

I read several reviews online about this video. I couldn't find one that had anything bad to say, and I have to agree!

This video is written and filmed for the ""SLR new comer"". I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was done. VERY easy to understand, and broken down into sections that make sense.

Along the way there are ""assignments"" that the instructor gives you, along with examples of these assignments. These are designed to make you put into action what you learned in that section. I found this extremely helpful in learning this camera.

It goes on to touch on composition. This is as important, or maybe even more important, than knowing how to use all the functions of this camera. Once you understand the basic principals of composition, then you will understand the importance of all of the functions on the camera and when to use them.

After watching this video and playing with the camera, you will be able to take yours to just about any situation, apply the principals learned in this video and start taking shots like the pros!

I know, I have started doing it! This comes highly recommended. The laminated flip card is a nice bonus!",1209945600,,1500,4.616541353383458

8202537,1,B000RULUUC,This poorly produced video looks like it was shot in somebody's living room. It is so hard to watch that its content is almost irrelevant.  The picture is often so dark that one cannot make out the detail on the camera.  Caveat Emptor! Buyer Beware!,1178409600,,249,4.511111111111111
