7361538,4,B013BPR8FA,"*I received a review copy of this miniseries in exchange for an honest review

Ive heard many people complain about SyFy Channel, saying they show very little science fiction these days.  While that might be true, SyFy Channel still knows what us genre fans like, and they deliver when they can.  Such is the case with ASCENSION, a miniseries that debuted on SyFy Channel a while ago.  This is one of the most engaging titles weve ever been offered from SyFy Channel, and I hope to see more of this quality from them in the future.

One of the biggest draws of this film is how human drama is set against a genre-specific backdrop.  This aspect is also the root of many shows I love:  THE WALKING DEAD, BLACK SAILS, and GAME OF THRONES just to name a few.  All offer exciting and fantastical elements as a stage on which to play out the more humanistic components of the plot.

ASCENSION is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The film spares no expense when it comes to offering what a spacecraft built in the 60s might look like.  The attention to detail is fantastic, and it helps to immerse the viewer in the experience.

The acting is also top notch as well.  The cast is filled with all-star talent, that includes Tricia Helfer, Gil Bellows, Brian Van Holt, Andrea Roth, Brandon P. Bell, and Brad Carter.  If youve never heard their names before, chances are you will in the future.  The whole cast meshes well together and offers memorable performances.

The special effects in ASCENSION are nice, although I did see a couple of scenes that looked a bit too cartoonish.  These particularly occur with the exterior shots of the ship.  Still, theres no denying these effects are better than what we usually see from SyFy, which is a big plus in my book.

The drama, however, is what wins me over here.  The description above claims the film is like Mad Men in space, and that is the perfect way to describe it.  Theres more twists and turns in the plot than in a soap opera.  And just when you think you know whats going to happen, the show turns your assumptions sideways.

ASCENSION is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Theres a lot to like here, and SyFy Channel shows us that it is still a relevant station.  Check this out for sure.",1446595200,9,2255,4.45476772616137
7361539,3,B013BPR8FA,"What if in 1963, at the height of the cold war, we hedged our bets by launching a huge interstellar ship call the U.S.S. Ascension with 600 or so people to insure our survival.

Now that ship being 51 years out on the 100 year mission is threatened by an unheard of domestic murder?

---------

In the movie The Thrill of It All (1963), each night the same actors would dress up in different period pieces. The bad guy German Officer / Cad / Cowboy would get the same drink thrown in his face. Kids watching would say I saw that last night. The producers would say it was so imperceptible that the viewers would not notice.

This mini-series is so imperceptible that you will not notice that the same scenarios and verbiage was used in dozens of T. V. quality mini-series. Of course I like the Braniff era clothing.",1445126400,5,815,4.413333333333333
7361540,5,B013BPR8FA,"You do not see whats coming! And I am not going to spoil anything.  But I do feel the need to voice the great disappointment with syfy for not doing more then the mini series with this.  They set up the whole way for so many different possibilities and it would have been great to see where they would have taken us.  First parts always lay the ground work for great show that the companies drop after the first go round these days.  Not sure if its because viewers do not want to put the time and wait or companies just want the biggest watcher base.  They, either group or both. really missed out on one of the few written creative program that was original and just getting great!!  Hope they reconsider and do great with sales on the dvd marketing end.  One can only hope!",1441238400,27,776,4.273972602739726

7361555,5,B013BPR8FA,"This is absolutely one of my favourite-ever scifi series. On my scale --- which may not be the same as yours --- it scores at the top on every major and minor metric. I honestly believe the entire crew did virtually nothing wrong start to finish. Now my primary metric for scifi is that a real, imaginative world is created that is inviting and believable at the day-to-day level, and that the viewer is drawn in to establish an increasing commitment over time. I score Ascension 100% on this metric. I also tend to like a 50s and 60s feel, as in my opinion, that is the era when the best science fiction was written ---- maybe that's more personal, but this one again scores 100%, as it's intentionally seeking to recapture a 50s-60s ambience (there were a few 70s and later bloopers, but I was willing to overlook them). As for the story itself, it is engaging and stimulating at every level. This show was produced for one season and dropped. What a loss! I could easily have watched 20 seasons of this one.",1454457600,,1010,4.464864864864865

7361558,2,B013BPR8FA,"Full disclosure, I'm not a huge sci-fi fan but do like Star Wars, Star Trek TOS, and films like Blade Runner, and Avatar so not adverse to the genre either.  The premise of this series compelled me to buy a copy.  JFK's Cold War doomsday plan to save humanity makes a great story so my hopes were high but quickly ruined when it's revealed that the USS Ascension isn't really in space for 51 years of a 100 year mission and actually is just a movie set.  The whole thing's a social engineering experiment that goes awry when there's a murder ""on board"".  Things get more and more confusing as it progresses, there's a deal about a young girl who's a telekinetic and drama going on outside the experiment with the scientists controlling the project... I got a headache by the time it was over.  The cast's mostly unknowns except Brian Van Holt who takes a respite here from playing his usual boozy reprobate characters (Cougar Town, The Bridge) to play a boozy uniformed reprobate as the ship's captain channeling more Don Draper than Captain Kirk .  Also we have Battlestar Gallactica reboot star Trisha Helfer as his wife doing her usual hot babe with an attitude thing.  This could have been so much more but by the time the 3 episodes of this mini-series are over there's really nowhere else for them to go.",1452470400,6,1310,4.548936170212766
7361559,5,B013BPR8FA,The series is excellent as far as it goes. Just to be clear for anyone making a purchase (or watching on Netflix) the series just ends without being a complete story. It was cancelled before resolving many really interesting cliffhangers.,1452211200,,238,4.975

8727151,1,B013BPR8FA,"Not a bad storyline but ruined with the sex scenes.  The acting is mediocre to ok which, I believe, is why they added the sex scenes - to keep people's attention.  In Hollywood sex scenes are usually there for poor writing and/or acting.  Its a shame, it could have been much much better.  Why can't Hollywood just produce good writing?",1519862400,,336,4.55
8727152,3,B013BPR8FA,"After watching what is essentially a 4.3 hour long movie with 5 breaks, I have some heavily mixed thoughts about it.  I will break this review up into 3 parts:
1: What I was hoping to see
2: What I actually saw
3: Thoughts on what was seen

FIRST
First and foremost, what I was expecting... What drew me to this little series on network-flicks (can't say the real name of the service here, so I made it obvious, take a guess), it was fully advertised as humanity surviving in space, in a rocket launched at the peak of the cold war, surviving in space with technology from the 60s, and that there would be problems, and for the first 2 and a half episodes, it was... or at least that is what was fully believed.  I was expecting this to be a movie that depicted the problems and complications that would be presented due to the impact it had on those who grew up on the thing from infancy, and later cause different levels of conflict, from 2 people not liking each-other for some odd reason, to people trying to sabotage the ship ending the entire mission.  And of course I didn't know what I was going to see, so I watched it... obviously... because I wanted to see it.

SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT
Secondly, so problems started, some girl got murdered by someone who's dad smuggled a pistol, and of course none of the crew has dealt with a murder before, only petty theft and fights.  So now the guy in charge of solving it has to learn how to do investigative police work to solve the murder, so now a plot has taken root.  So they find the supposed killer and temporarily solve the problem, and it's directly after that, you learn it's one big gigantic colossal science experiment to create the perfect human using a computer that matches the best candidates from the genetic pool, as well as prevent overpopulation of the ship keeping the population at a static 600 crew when someone dies.  Turns out no one actually left Earth.  Once that was learned, I started gritting my teeth, contemplating whether or not to turn the show off.  So several plots start taking root, and I'm really not liking the way the story turned and kept turning, and every episode just got even weirder.  First it's an expensive [understatement] science experiment, next, the little girl has supernatural abilities, and then the ghost of the dead girl starts guiding telepathic girl, and I'm completely lost at this point.  Soon enough the experiment comes to a grinding halt.  I did find one good light out of this, the original guy that got framed for murder got out.  I was left with the question of ""what would happen if someone found out they were part of a breeding experiment?"", and I got my answer.

THIRD
My thoughts summed up.  I was absolutely loving the series after the first 2 episodes, but after the big plot twist in the third episode, I thoroughly believe the director was laughing at me because he knows he wasted my time.  At first it had that perfect blend of sci-fi, meaning it wasn't too unrealistic, that even though the ship wouldn't have been possible back in the 1960s, it could be by 2060, maybe earlier, maybe later, the point is the concept is plausible and could be under construction in space sometime in the near or far future. And no, it could not be launched from the groun, the construction would have to be in space because a station of that magnitude, it would simply be too heavy.  But it went full sci-fi with the use of a girl with supernatural, know-all telepathic abilities and her undead ghost friend.  All in all, had the story continued as it was from the first 2 episodes, it would have been an interesting viewing.",1501286400,,3663,4.5227272727272725
8727153,1,B013BPR8FA,"UPDATE:  After giving this three stars and writing the review below, I foolishly continued with the series out of curiosity.  What a total waste of time.  I felt compelled to change my rating accordingly.

I was ready to quit watching until I just reached the end of the second part of episode one with the ""twist.""  I'll try to go further with it, although I honestly haven't seen so many bad actors in one place.  Laughably bad.  Sets are marginal and costumes are cheap.  Writing is terrible.  But now I'd like to see if this plot makes it easier to tolerate the negatives.",1490659200,,576,4.514563106796117
8727154,5,B013BPR8FA,"Well-written and well-acted. The major plot twist (not at all expected) comes early, but the miniseries continues to hold ones attention until the end.

8727157,4,B013BPR8FA,Saw the miniseries on TV. . . Interesting plot and plot twist. . . It keeps you guessing all the way till the end. Tricia Helfer being in it was an added bonus.,1467849600,,160,3.878787878787879
8727158,3,B013BPR8FA,"Im a space opera junkie so when I discovered there was a 2014 Canadian/US science fiction mystery drama television miniseries which aired on Syfy that somehow escaped my attention, I had to put aside dozens of pressing tasks to give it its due.  Now that Ive gone through the series from start to finish, I can describe the entire experience in a single word: underwhelming.

Now I realize Im partially to blame for this reaction because lets face it, so much of our value in entertainment is derived from expectations.  When I read the summary (back in 1963, the U.S. government launched a covert space mission sending hundreds of men, women and children on a century-long voyage aboard the star ship Ascension to populate a new world. Nearly 50-years into the journey, as they approach the point of no return, a mysterious murder of a young woman causes the ship's population to question the true nature of their mission), I thought- huh now thats a different twist on a story thats been told over and over again.

And amazingly, watch the first two episodes of this 6-part miniseries (43-minutes each) and you will come away thoroughly convinced they nailed it!  A ship in deep space with a population of 600 enduring threats such as radiation storms and navigation questions; clothing, technology and instrumentation all straight out of the era from which the ship had launched, a unique disorder manifesting in the ships younger inhabitants based upon the realization that they are born, will live their entire lives aboard the ship and die before ever reaching their destination- in short it was looking like all systems go (if youll pardon the bad pun).

Then the twist arrived.  Im not here to give spoilers that could potentially ruin the viewing experience for others but there is an unmistakable turning point for this tale that, in my opinion, singlehandedly undoes all of the brilliance the premise and first few episodes deliver.  In an instant, the reason this series is classified as speculative fiction rather than space opera reveals itself in a blur of X-Files style government conspiracy, horror elements, metaphysical nonsense etc.  This could all be forgivable of course had the shows inception not raised the bar for potential so high.

By the end I came away feeling like this is a very average sci-fi piece; perhaps more concerned with its own self-serving agendas of artful thematics than it was delivering something genuinely interesting.  Again all of this could be more easily overlooked if not for those hints in the beginning of a tale that I would liked to have continued on for the duration of the show.

Of course my 3-star rating says that the experience wasn't a total loss and I do stand by that.  There are certainly some worthy points to be found here.  The casting is pretty spot on with Battlestar Galacticas Tricia Helfer doing a bang up job as a woman of cunning authority.  The sets (one continuous shot in particular that spans the sprawling interior of Ascension from lower level to top is incredible) create a truly organic feel for both the ship and the culture within it.  The who done it angle is very effective at driving the plot forward, especially early on when it appears so much thought and effort had gone into making Ascensions enclosed ecosystem a sort of utopia.

In conclusion there are certainly worse ways to spend 180-minutes and fans of high-concept (in this case really high) sci-fi may enjoy the twisting road the show takes to its conclusion.  I personally would have liked it far better had the plot simply stayed on course from the beginning and been stretched out to at least a 13-episode series.  The potential to have been a sort of fusion between Mad Men and Battlestar Galactica (the reboot of course) presents a very intriguing base for a series indeed.  Its a strange crime to have to penalize a show for starting out so much better than it ended but Ascension proved would it could be very early on.  What it becomes, however, never quite manages to fill its own shoes.",1465948800,7,4047,4.802593659942363
8727159,5,B013BPR8FA,"This is one of those shows that has an extremely slow, confusing start (which was annoying), but by the end I was glued to the TV. I didn't plan to marathon my way through all six episodes in one sitting, but that's exactly what happened.

**It's a little hard to review this mini-series without including spoilers, so fair warning.**

As others have mentioned, there's a major twist that is revealed early on. Episode one starts with a sort of ""Mad Men in Space"" type thing - a massive ship launched in the 60s is now 50 years into its journey. What started with 70 scientists and a dozen bright kids has grown into a crew of 600, and the ship is a confusing mix of 60s attitudes, clothing, & technology - on a space ship that looks WAY too advanced for anything we could even make today. I spent most of the first episode *REALLY* disliking this show because NOTHING made any sense.

Then the 'Man Behind the Curtain' is revealed, and some of the questions were answered. And THEN it started to get interesting. Really, really interesting. I spent the rest of the mini-series becoming more & more fascinated by the characters and the politics - both of those inside the ship and those controlling it. Little bits of information are dolled out like breadcrumbs, and the true nature of the project is a mystery right up until the last second of the last episode. Like I said - the show turned out to be riveting. I was COMPLETELY glued to my TV by the end.

If you're like me and was frustrated with the first episode (as in, how exactly is there a BEACH on a spaceship and why does everything look pristine after 50 years and three generations of wear & tear??) - keep watching. It's worth it. Not everything is explained, but enough clicked together that I could overlook the ""Mad Men knock-off aspect"" to the show.

Such a shame that this was cancelled, and on such a MASSIVE cliffhanger as well. It may have had a slow start, but the acting was good and the moral & intellectual questions raised by the show were fascinating. I had to stop and Google ""punctuated equilibrium"" when it was brought up, but once I did the show took on a whole new level of interesting. The cliffhanger was brilliant (didn't see THAT coming!) and the show had SO much potential going into a second season.

Another clever Sci-Fi venture that was cancelled way too soon. It's definitely worth watching despite getting the ax.",1464566400,4,2407,4.52183908045977
8727160,3,B013BPR8FA,"Between the promos and the teasers they really generated a great deal of well deserved attention, I thought ""how could they screw this up? well the answer is ""of course they can screw this up. (spoilers follow..)

The ""twist"" at the end of Episode 2 (or part1 depending on what you count) did them in for me, had they not had the twist it would have been a far better series and I suspect would have gone further.
*spoilers below!*

However by having them never actually be in space they robbed the series of what could have been a great alternate history storyline that could have still worked as a series.",1459123200,4,607,4.45945945945946
