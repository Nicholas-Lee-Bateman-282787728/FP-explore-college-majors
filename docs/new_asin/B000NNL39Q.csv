The video is outstanding (and the winner of a prestigous Silver Telly Award), easy to watch, compelling, and informative.  The workbook contains all of the basic information you'll need to give your lawyer, mediator, collaborative lawyer, legal aid and/or the court---whichever type of agency is helping you with your divorce.  The AFCC booklet that's enclosed, Shared Parenting Guide, is one of the best single resources available for creating a parenting plan.
