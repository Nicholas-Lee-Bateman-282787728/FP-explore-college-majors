7320766,2,B0112HPVM6,"We meet Veronica as a child whose parents died. She has a photographic memory and gets trained for a future job. In a poorly developed subplot 4 guys hunt and kill a woman in the woods. Veronica (Abigail Breslin) who has been in some sort of training for 12 years, practices stuff she should already know. Her photographic memory never enters the script again.

Veronica agrees to go into the woods with the four boys with the intent of killing them.

I thought the film was put together awkwardly and Abigail Breslin couldn't handle the role. She was completely unconvincing which may also be the fault of the director.

Guide: No f-bomb, sex, or nudity.",1437177600,9,655,4.678260869565217
7320767,2,B0112HPVM6,"Pretty badly botched thriller with Abigail Breslin playing a teen assassin trained to be a killer since early childhood who is sent in to be the next victim of four nasty young white men who dress up in tuxedos like the rat pack and hunt women in the woods.  Breslin's Veronica is supposed to turn the tables on the young men and kill them.  Why the authorities couldn't simply arrest them is never explained.  Neither is how they could have killed at least a dozen young women in a small town without arousing a lot of suspicion.

Final Girl represents a failure on every level.  The opening scene where the small child version of Breslin's character is being interviewed by Wes Bentley to determine her suitability for training is the best in the movie by far--but the point of the scene is not only that she's very smart but also feels no natural empathy which would make her a perfect candidate to become a trained killer--so making the teen version played by Breslin a comparative softie who is in love with her trainer feels like a big miscalculation.

Saoirse Ronan played a much more plausible teen assassin in Hannah because she is more of a chameleon than Abigail Breslin who has a Kewpie doll quality she can't quite seem to shake even when she is trying to play edgier roles.  That still isn't a deal breaker because Breslin's natural girlishness (she played an American Girl once upon a time) could have been used to good effect in a smarter movie--there's no reason seeing Breslin beating a bunch of sadistic young men to death shouldn't have been fun but it really isn't.

When Breslin goes in the woods she manages to give three of the four young men alcohol laced with strong hallucinogens--and the hallucinations badly undermine any possible visceral quality to her violent encounters with the cocky, murderous young men.  There also appears to be a pretty extensive use of a body double for Breslin during the fight scenes which was another unforced mistake--it's not like she's being asked to do any gymnastic flips or martial arts so there isn't any reason she couldn't have done the fight scenes herself.  The novelty of seeing Little Miss Sunshine kill men with her bare hands is lost when most of the time you can't see Abigail Breslin's face.

If you want to see a genuinely excellent example of how to do a girl turns the tables on her would be killers premise check out Don Coscarelli's fantastic Masters of Horror episode ""Incident On and Off A Mountain Road"" which was funnier, smarter and much more thrilling.  Final Girl ultimately feels like a poor man's La Femme Nikita minus any thrills or sense of danger.",1437091200,4,2640,4.690476190476191
7320768,2,B0112HPVM6,"Could have been a great movie, but the acting and dialogue killed it. Abigail Breslin was terrible. I noticed the first time she shot a gun then it was confirmed during her boxing training sequence that she was not meant for the part and that the director didn't care at all about making the actress look believable. Knowing what I know about her character if she came to kill me, I would just laugh.
The dialogue was REALLY terrible. It reminded me of dialogue from Buffy the Vampire slayer minus the wit and delivery. It was ""try hard"" to say the least.
Wes Bentley was this movies only saving grace. He was actually very good for his role, I'm just sorry that the role was so bad",1437004800,3,682,4.377952755905512

7320817,4,B0112HPVM6,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I liked the premise and the actors very much. I like Wes Bentley a lot. Abigail Breslin was also enchanting to watch on screen. Alexander Ludwig was very convincing as the main antagonist. The cinematography was beautifully done. While a far cry from Godfather part 1, I must say I found this movie remarkably entertaining. For a low budget flick, it was a great concept. However, there were a few criticisms I must share. First, the fight scenes were not done well. Ms. Breslin needed to be taught how to fight better. The training scenes with her and Wes just weren't convincing. During the boxing scenes, neither Mr. Bentley nor Ms. Breslin looked like they knew what they were doing. Also, there is one major plot hole. If Mr. Bentley's character is training her from a young girl to take out these people because they killed his wife and daughter, the timeframe is not realistic. For example, the girl was trained for 12 years, and it is assumed the four bad guys have been doing this for 12 years. But in the movie, they were portrayed as being no more than 18 years old. So, they were hunting down girls when they were 6 years old? C'mon! A bunch of six year olds running around in the woods with axes sounds hilarious! Anyway, even with all these issues, I still enjoyed it. Very entertaining film. I've seen higher budget productions that were less entertaining. Kudos to the producers as it probably took about two weeks to shoot this flick.",1495670400,,1503,4.591078066914498

First of all, every movie made is like a batter at the plate, they are don't hit home runs every time they come to the plate, and to criticize them for not hitting a home run is stupidity. It's very possible to watch a movie and just happen to enjoy it for the entertainment value it has, not because it has to be perfect. To tear every movie apart frame by frame is just plain dumb. As far as her being an assassin, this just goes to prove the naivety of the general public who thinks that every assassin is like James bond or some Karate expert.  This was made much more to real life than some kung fu guy taking on 50 enemies all at once. People should grow up just a little bit.

At first glimpse, I thought the concept was cool yet extremely asinine. However, I was bored, it was late, a lo and behold, I found a good movie. Granted, I'm an easily impressed movie watcher. But I also have a short attention span.

There are actually some really great actors in this movie, which was took a big part in piquing my interest. I don't think you can expect so much from this movie, though. It's an hour and a half. You can't fit a perfect thriller in an hour and a half. The characters are mildly underdeveloped--probably to give effect, maybe? Yes, the story is two dementional, and the movie ends extremely awkwardly, but it's shocking and definitely worth watching. I'd watch it on Netflix, though.

7320851,2,B0112HPVM6,"NOTE: There is another horror movie made in 2015 called ""The Final Girls"" starring Taissa Fermiga and Malin Akerman. These two movies are completely different. Read the descriptions on the Amazon page or this review to be sure you're buying or watching the right one.

For child actors, navigating their careers through puberty and into adulthood can be a tricky proposition. For every Jodie Foster, who didn't skip a beat, there's a Macauley Culkin, who has been pretty much MIA for the last 20 years. Former Oscar nominee (for Little Miss Sunshine) Abigail Breslin has had her share of problems as well, and her first attempt at a more-or-less adult lead role in ""Final Girl"" won't help.

The best way to describe ""Final Girl"" is as a high school version of ""La Femme Nikita"" with a script written by actual high schoolers. Veronica (Breslin) was orphaned as a child when her parents were murdered, and she was subsequently raised by a mysterious man named William (Wes Bentley), who had also suffered tragedy in his life. Over the next dozen years, William trained Veronica to be a killer, including lots of weapons training and various forms of hand-to-hand combat.

Eventually, William gives Veronica her first assignment, to eliminate a group of preppy serial killers who dress up in tuxedos and take attractive blondes out in the woods and hunt them down for sport, using axes and baseball bats. (The film never explains how 20 attractive young women could disappear in one community over a two-year period without resulting in a major police investigation and media frenzy.) Veronica easily arranges to become their next potential victim and willingly goes off with them to what's ostensibly a party in the woods.

Of course, many horror films over the years have wound up with a ""final girl"" being chased through the woods by one or more depraved killers. ""Final Girl"" turns the premise around and essentially has Veronica baiting and manipulating the killers at the same time as they think they are manipulating her. It's not a bad premise, but unfortunately, the execution is badly flawed, and the culprit is primarily the screenplay. The movie also suffers from a fatal bit of miscasting. Abigail Breslin, although she certainly looks the part, simply doesn't have the martial arts skills to convincingly bluff her way through the action scenes, and novice director Tyler Shields wasn't skilled enough to shoot around it.

As a result, the early scenes featuring Breslin sparring with Wes Bentley are quite poorly staged, and the entire first 30 minutes of ""Final Girl"" is confusingly edited, with scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense. The audience does get to meet the villains, who are a repulsive group of psychos, except for leader Jameson (Alexander Ludwig), who is a smugly handsome, repulsive psycho. And the audience also gets ""treated"" to a genuinely creepy scene in which Breslin (who was 16 when ""Final Girl"" was made and looks it) shares a motel room bed with Bentley (who was 35 and looks it as well) for a few minutes and the actors engage in a bit of how-far-will-they-go game playing with the audience.

Final Girl does pick up when Veronica does go off with the killers, and the group winds up playing a bizarre form of Truth or Dare, in which most of the questions deal with death and murder. Theres a lot and game playing here, with Veronica rather skillfully manipulating the killers from the moment she steps into the car with them. If the entire film had been made with this level of skill and cleverness, it could have been an entertaining guilty pleasure.

Unfortunately, once the actual chase begins (which frankly is what most viewers have been waiting for), it proves a major disappointment. The film obviously wasn't shot in back country; instead no one runs for more than about ten seconds at a time, and the finale looks to have been shot in a typical urban park at night. Plus, Veronica is easily able to spike the flask the killers are passing around, which gives some of them a dose of some mind-altering drug that gives them hallucinations of, among other things, people whering giant panda heads. Thats even sillier onscreen than it sounds. What actual combat there is proves to be quite underwhelming.

Final Girl wound up exactly where it belonged, dumped in with a host of other direct-to-video horror films. A decent middle section is sandwiched between a confusing beginning and a disappointing finale. Abigail Breslin does a decent job as an actress, and her innocent look and demeanor makes several sequences in the movie considerably more chilling than they might have been with a tougher-looking actress in the role. But she simply doesnt have the physical skills the film requires for the action scenes. Director Shields doesnt help either by throwing in some downright silly artistic touches. Hopefully, Final Girl won't be the final word on Breslins career, but it shouldnt be a viewers final choice when it comes to picking a horror film to watch some weekend.",1468022400,,5027,4.898942420681551

not what i thought! It was SUPIRSINGLY good! The action is in the latter part of the movie, the first 25-30 minutes is ""recon"" on the men and a girl getting chased and killed in the woods.

the ONLY compaint I have is the VERY last kill... the leader ofthe group his took FOREVER.....It got a little boring then the tree hanging happened!! The 21 supposed girls coming back to get thier revenge...only thing i didn't get... WHY te blue eyes? I mean I KINDA get it but not really!

7320886,2,B0112HPVM6,"This movie could have been awesome, but there are so many flaws and unanswered questions. Before I get into what I didn't like about the movie, I will say all the actors did a very good job. It wasn't them that ruined the movie for me, it was the lack of depth in the story telling. I know, I know, many horror movies don't have much of a plot, but since this one was going for an art house feel, I expected more from it.

Spoilers Ahead.

At the beginning we see a young Veronica (Abigail Breslin) in an institutional room, and William (Wes Bentley) is asking her some questions in regards to what she remembers about her surroundings.
After she answers him, we know that she is going to be trained to be an assassin.

Time passes (dont remember if it was 10 or 12 years), and we see William training Veronica. This is the part that started to grate on my nerves. Over a decade has passed, but hes still training her as if she is a newbie. These training sessions could have been really cool. I think the director was going for arty, and it fell flat.

We then get to the pack of boys who take young, blonde women out to the woods, chase them and kill them. At one point the main guy, Jameson, is asked why he likes blondes, and he doesnt give an answer. Once again the artiness comes in, all the boys are dressed in tuxedos, and the girl is in a formal dress. This theme continues to the clothes that the assassins have been wearing, and to what all the customers are wearing in the diner where the boys pick up the girls.

Now for the part I didn't understand, Veronica is supposed to go into the woods with them without any weapons. She is wearing a dress that is long, and loose enough that she could have a gun strapped to her leg. She also has a purse, that she could have had a knife or brass knuckles in. Instead she brings with her a flask that has a bit extra in it.
This flask makes the boys trip, so when Veronica does fight them, once again its done in an arty way. Harsh lights are shining on them, and it looks like a ballet dance.

If the director/writer/whomever was going for arty, or thought provoking, he had numerous chances. Besides the previous times Ive mentioned, when Jameson is talking with Veronica at the end, they could have delved into a theological discussion. But once again, it just didn't have the umph to make a good scene.",1460764800,,2360,4.268456375838926

This film did everything wrong executing the surprisingly cool concept.  No surprises.  Everything was telegraphed.  Lots of questions after it was all over.  SPOILERS...  Victim turns everything around on her stalker/killers.  Cool.  She's an assassin/covert operative.  Way cool.  You would think that this bit of information would be held back to be revealed as a surprise later in the picture.  Nope.  It's given to you right up front.  We even see her recruited at a young age and progress 12 years later.  After 12 years, she is still a pretty horrible assassin/covert operative or whatever.  What HAS she been doing for 12 years?  Certainly not training.  The ""elite"" men she takes out should have been a lot easier.  ESPECIALLY as they were drugged.  That in itself is another point of contention.  By giving hallucinogens to your victims and they are seeing things when they die, all manner of ""come uppance"" is removed.  They have no idea why they're getting killed.  There is no ""payback"" for misdeeds when they believe that they are getting killed by school mascots or whatever the heck those things were.  Why this particular drug is used is never explained, nor is it integrated into the plot that the victims see their deepest fear.  It has a very specific affect, but no reason is worked into the story other than to take away from the audience that ""Yes!"" moment when the bad guys are dispatched.  Her trainer, worst trainer ever (12 Years!), has lost a wife and child.  There is no tie to this plot.  No explanation is given why he is going after these particular guys or the ""organization"" for which he works.  You expect it to be personal in some way.  It is not.  It is all very matter of fact.  A bit of time is given to the trainee wanting to ""be with"" the trainer.  This is shrugged off.  There is no connection between them of an emotional nature whatsoever.  The recruitment and ""training"" should really have been done in flashback after the reveal of her being an ""assassin,"" which should have been something fun midway through the film.  She should not have needed to use drugs and been more of a badass.  Again...  Storytelling 101 was skipped by this writer.  Ugh.  At least it was cheap.",1449187200,14,2332,4.689826302729529

7320984,3,B0112HPVM6,"Final Girl (not to be confused with The Final Girls) is a stylish horror movie with an increasingly common twist: the girl being chased by killers is highly skilled herself, and the hunters become the hunted.  It's hard to say where the movie goes wrong.

Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) shows off her Academy-nominated chops, moving smoothly from scared teenage girl to cold and ready fighter.  Wes Bentley (The Hunger Games) is terrific as her mentor.  Alexander Ludwig (The Hunger Games, The Final Girls) does a fine job as the leader of the teenage killers, even if he is several years to old for the part.  The other three killers manage to differentiate themselves neatly despite all being brunets in suits.  But Final Girl is just cold.

Final Girl is the directorial debut of Tyler Shields, a photographer.  His skill shows in every frame of the movie.  The composition of it is beautiful, especially the lighting.  It feels derivative, however.  The color scheme is mostly black, white, and red and there is a retro, fifties noir feel.  It's been done, and the fifties' feel adds nothing to the story.

The best scene is probably Danny (Logan Huffman) dancing with his axe, a fun scene that was done even better in Kung Fu Hustle.

The story of Final Girl is simple, and yet leaves so many questions.  How did Veronica and William know about these four?  How do others not, if twenty blonde girls have gone missing recently?  There's also the fact that Veronica is supposed to win her fights by being smarter, and yet the movie has her get into a fistfight with Jameson.  As hard as the movie tries, Ludwig is at least a foot taller than Breslin and quite muscular.  I'd love to see her win through wits as the movie promised; the fistfight is just ridiculous.

Final Girl looks lovely and boasts several good performances.  But the thin story doesn't have enough detail to support what is there because of the emphasis on style over substance.  There's no tension to the story, and the ideas have been executed better elsewhere.  This was a waste of the cast's talents.",1447113600,,2086,4.717451523545706

7320999,3,B0112HPVM6,"This is an interesting take-off on the revenge genre that made me think, oddly enough, of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" looked at from a darker viewpoint - young, attractive and almost supernaturally composed girl is taken under the wing of a mysterious older guy who teaches her all the tricks of the assassin's trade (and buys her ice cream when she does well), putting her through ten years of grueling training that would put most kids (and adults) in the hospital.  What he wants her to do, apparently, is kill bad  guys who because they have wealth, political connections and are more intelligent than average, manage to slip through cracks in the judicial net (whether he wants her to keep on doing this after the episode showed in the movie is never made clear). Her first target is a group of handsome,.well-bred young guys who are psychopaths that lure teenaged girls into the woods around Vancouver and then hunt them down and kill them, like ""The Most Dangerous Game.""  When they meet Veronica, it takes them a while to realize that SHE'S not the one in trouble... In a way, Abigail Breslin as Veronica is following a path she set foot on in ""Zombieland"" -- a harmless-looking teenaged blonde who'll kick your toukhis from here to Butte Montana if you mess with her.  The reason I call it a dark version of ""Buffy"" is that it's one in which ""Buffy"",(and to extent her ""Giles"" - here named William) are just as psychopathic in their own way as the guys they're hunting, always a problem in vigilante justice.  The photography is beautiful. as you'd expect from a Director who's basically a still photographer, the scenery is stark and much grimmer than the Vancouver I remember (enhanced by the fact that there is no CGI at all): and most of the characters are believable.  So it's a good mid-level entry in the ""teens in danger"" genre that, like John Carpenter's original Halloween,doesnt glory in spurting blood and teenaged nudity, and makes up for a plot that may falter a bit at times but kept me watching.",1446336000,,2019,4.6892655367231635

7321002,4,B0112HPVM6,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There have been revenge films since movie began being made. Perhaps the most famous of these was DEATH WISH, the Charles Bronson starring film that had him taking out street thugs to the cheers of movie goers who were tired of being victims of crime. With FINAL GIRL we get a twist on the revenge film nearing what was accomplished in OLDBOY.

The film opens with young Veronica being questioned by William (Wes Bentley). Her parents have just died and she seems nonplussed by that fact. With each question William gets to know more about the mind of Veronica and when he finds her suitable for his needs he offers to take care of her from now on. What that need is is to create a perfect assassin, a weapon that can take out his revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife and daughter.

Twelve years pass and Veronica (Abigail Breslin) is now grown. We witness her training at the hands of William. A brutal task master when need be, he helps Veronica to learn how to cope with any and all obstacles that might come her way. He takes her shoes when shes in the woods, he gives her a cocktail of drugs to prepare her for what its like to battle under duress and he shows her that a gun isn't the way to handle things because bullets eventually run out. When he feels she is finally ready, the pair set out on their task.

The victims in mind are a predatory bunch. While we might question Williams moral sense early on it becomes apparent why hes taking the route he has all these years. The group of young men he is about to turn Veronica loose on are serial killers. Four best friends with sociopathic qualities, this group of well-dressed killers will pick a young blonde, invite her to a party and then turn her lose in the forest while they track her down and kill her. While its never clearly stated one has to assume one of their victims was Williams daughter.

Veronica does some reconnaissance by talking to one of the young mens girlfriend and understand then that these men have no sense of right and wrong, they are incapable of love and affection. There only joy comes from the pain and suffering they instill in others. She suggest the girl can do better and then preps for her confrontation.

It comes easily. The groups ringleader Jameson (Alexander Ludwig) sees Veronica in the diner they frequent, an angelic vision with blonde hair in bright light, and approaches her. He casually and with an aristocratic air invites her to a party the next night. She accepts and the following night meets the rest of the group. Promising that others are on the way to meet them she goes along and finds herself in the forest with this group of tuxedo wearing young men. She knows what they are. They have no clue what they have gotten themselves into. Their night of fun will soon come face to face with Williams weapon of revenge.

To begin with no one should take this movie as a reality based film. It is a story plain and simple that is shot in such a way as to be more artistic than one would expect given the material being witnessed. While this could have fallen away into the B-movie category the performances by all involved and the style with which it is shot make it more than that. Directed by photographer Tyler Shields it becomes obvious early on that he has an eye for composition with his choices of light and dark, the framing of his movie in all scenes. Its not that its overbearing but it take the lowbrow medium and elevates it.

What was nice to see in this film was the Shields didn't resort to the least common denominator that most directors would, having the woman in question appear in various forms of undress before she took on her aggressors. Overused in films like the I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE series it carries no weight any longer and is just an exploitation device that no longer shocks as it once did. Instead he makes Veronica a very empowered young woman. And while after 12 years of training she has no problem killing someone there is also a moral base for her actions that is displayed in the comments and discussions she has with William. Viewers could find her a scary person to come into contact with but at the same time you can imagine her before a jury that would sympathize with her every move and vindicate her with a not guilty verdict.

The movie comes to DVD on the heels of Halloween and would make a great movie to watch on that night or any other. It doesnt rely on blood or gore and tells an interesting story thats done so well it might be worth additional viewings. I know its one Ill add to my collection.",1445904000,4,4631,4.4196951934349356

7321022,2,B0112HPVM6,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I sometimes wonder if actors and actresses have a choice in taking some of the roles they accept.  I know contractual obligations can force them to do movies they wouldnt normally do, and many of these films are absolute bombs.  FINAL GIRL runs close to being one of these titles.  It lacks in substance and suspense, and although the plot-line is intriguing and could have been fun, the whole film falls flat.  Instead, we are given an almost surrealistic, dreamlike experience that is visually pleasant, but lacking in depth.

I REALLY wanted to like this film, so needless to say I am very disappointed.  The concept sounds fun, sort of a hybrid between films like HARD TARGET and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  As such, I wanted to see Abigail Breslin as a bad-ass, who doles out justice in vicious and gut-wrenching fashion.  But alas, that is not the case here.  The film feels more artistic than anything.

FINAL GIRL is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The lighting is fantastic, particularly in the night forest scenes.  The locations chosen for the lighting create an almost ethereal atmosphere in which the film unfolds.  This is one of the only positive things I can mention, unfortunately.

The acting talent is there, however the cast is only as good as the script they are performing.  Here, the performances feel fake and forced.  The star of the film, Abigail Breslin, gave a phenomenal performance a few months ago in MAGGIE; but this film does not showcase her talents whatsoever.  Likewise, the rest of the cast is bland in their deliveries.

Even the story itself is lacking.  There are many reality-suspending concepts we are asked to ingest, and none of them are really conceivable.  Similarly, a whole slew of questions arise that are never answered.  Who is the man that approaches young Veronica in the beginning?  How is he given access to her since her parents are dead?  Does he work for the government?  And after Veronica agrees to be his protege, what does she spend 12 years doing?  I assumed she was being trained as an assassin (based on what the man tells her), but instead we discover she wasn't doing much of anything.  Her training consists of an 80s-style work montage, in which she doesnt really learn much.

I could go on and on, but the bottom line about FINAL GIRL is that its poorly done and pretty boring as a whole.  Director Tyler Shields is well-known as a good photographer, but I am not impressed with this movie debut.  Perhaps his next film will be time better spent.  FINAL GIRL is available now in a variety of formats if you decide to check it out.",1444867200,2,2672,4.645299145299146

I'm glad I didn't let reviews sway me because this was actually very enjoyable. It's very artsy and more a case of style-over-substance but I found it surprisingly engrossing.

7321056,3,B0112HPVM6,"This film deserves no spoilers because everyone knows who did what right from the start of it. It is a spinoff of stories such as The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell only at least there was some suspense in that--no one knew what was going on until they were in the game, so to speak. It is also reminiscent of an old Avengers episode ""The Superlative Seven"" which was much better written. There is no tension here. The entire premise of this was pretty unconvincing; it's difficult to picture Abigail Breslin as an action hero of any type, and her stunts don't come anywhere even near Hit Girl, Alice or The Bride. But that's ok; she is supposed to feel no emotion as evidenced by the clip of her as a child in the opening. The boys are not particularly attractive and would have a hard time getting anybody to go anywhere with them except for money. I mean, did that guy REALLY suck up her entire milkshake and then practically belch in her face? How dreamy. Then we have Laughing Boy who can't dance, dragging an axe around, the two suspiciously Leopold/Loeb types who always seem to be together, one of whom eats earthworms, and one guy with a girlfriend who doesn't ask too many questions, cause she's scared to be alone. But Veronica has a purpose in being there, so she has to put up with all this nonsense before what Buster Keaton would call the big chase scene begins. But it's a wimpey buildup, and not a great payoff. The relationship between Veronica and her mentor remains undeveloped and we aren't given much background on the other victims. At some point Veronica had time to change her shoes and tie her hair back to get on with some real punching, but previous scenes show her even being trained in spike heels and a retro prom dress. I believe the exercise was to use no weapons but their own against them. But again this really wasn't developed in the script. I give it three stars cause I love the color of the red dress and I liked the hallucinatory scenes especially the evil pandas which seemed like a nod to ""Death Tube"" (a much scarier movie).

I have to say that I did like it and this was along the lines of a movie like Hanna. Seeing Breslin in a role like this was very interesting and she pulled it off very well. The only downside to this movie is that it seemed to start in the middle. There is no back story as to why William is doing this and most importantly, why they chose the group they did. On the other hand though the idea behind why Veronica chose them is enough for you to root for her.

7321094,2,B0112HPVM6,"Not to be confused with the horror-comedy The Final Girls (which comes out later this year), veteran genre fans should already know what the film's title is referring to: the heroine/last survivor in a horror movie. Based on that alone we can already guess as to what the story might be, which would've been fine had it been as simple and straight forward as the title suggests. This marks the feature film directorial debut for photographer Tyler Shields, who has apparently also dabbled in music videos. I've never heard of the guy until this project was announced years back, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. Sadly it's clear that putting it in the hands of an artsy photographer and combining it with a bad script turned what could've been a potentially decent slasher into a boring, nonsensical semi-revenge thriller.

The ridiculous story starts off with a character named William (Wes Bentley) interviewing a little girl named Veronica in an old dirty room (that doesn't seem shady at all). Her parents just died (they never say how, nor does she seem to care) and he asks her a series of questions, eventually coming to the conclusion that she's the type of person he's looking for. He tells her that he has a very important job for her, and with the promise of ice cream, she gladly accepts (entering super creeper territory now).

Jump to 12 years later and it turns out that William was only looking to turn the little girl into a killing machine (*whew*); training and preparing her for all sorts of physical encounters. Up until now Veronica was merely luring creepy old men and teaching them a lesson, but for her final test she will have to take on a group of young serial killers that prey on innocent women (specifically blondes).

Judging from my brief description of the film's plot you can gather that very little in the story makes any kind of sense and many things are simply never explained. Aside from all the plot-holes it takes almost an hour before we get to the good stuff. Before that they just go back and forth with training flashbacks and dull dialogue-filled scenes. Once the action does finally start there's absolutely no gore and barely even any blood. Even an axe to the chest results to nothing since it's so dark.

And I personally don't have anything against actress Abigail Breslin, but she was terribly miscast as Veronica. It's just hard to believe that little Abigail can easily manhandle all these dudes that are much larger than her. Not to mention she looked awkward in all her fight scenes, which is an obvious indication that she didn't undergo any sort of actual physical training before filming and if she did it definitely wasn't enough. Though, I'll say that the movie was well shot and had a nice look to it at times, but that's about all the good I can say about it.

Overall Final Girl is a little too dull, nonsensical, and artsy for its own good. The story doesn't make any sense and there's no satisfying deaths or gore to fall back on. I'd recommend skipping this one.",1440460800,,3036,4.667289719626168

It would have been a lot better if the man who trained her had a confession to make after she killed the 4 hunters by admitting that he had been married several times and all the women the hunters killed had been his previous wives and he was very rich from the insurance policies he had taken out on each wife before their ""tragic unexpected"" murder. But the hunters were blackmailing him for their share of the money now so he had trained her to kill them to tie up loose ends. End now....there is just one last loose end to tie up......then a final Epic battle of student vs Evil trainer. Then she kills him and takes all the money for herself and lives happily ever after in the Florida Keys!!!",1440288000,,823,4.316129032258065

7321113,3,B0112HPVM6,"This is a film I have been anticipating ever since I saw the trailor and heard about the premise. Unfortunately it was nothing like I had hoped.

I expected a good revenge Slasher with a lot of action and gore. What I got was a slow paced,bloodless film that had beautiful cinematography with little else to offer.

(Abigail Breslin) who is ""a trained assassin"" baits Four young men into taking her to their hunting grounds,where they have hunted killed and buried atleast Twenty girls. There is no suspense or Horror just dreamlike sequences as three of the boys have been tricked into drinking halucinaginics by Breslin's character (Veronica).Thee kills are stale, tame and highly forgettable.

The film is visually stunning but if I wanted that kind of film I would have chosen another genre. I was expecting something in the vein of I Spit On Your Grave or anything reminiscent of a harder edged revenge slasher. If you take it for what it is,a beautifully shot, artsy flick that doesn't take itself seriously or quite add up, then it's watchable!",1439510400,16,1051,4.8277777777777775

8723428,4,B0112HPVM6,"I just finished watching this movie and here is my review on it. Please know there may or may not be spoilers, I will do my best to keep them at a low.

The movie is about a bunch of high school guys who seek out beautiful women and go ""hunting"". They find their next woman, but she's more than they bargained for.

Let me start with the characters, choosing Abigaul Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Scream Queens) as the lead was an excellent choice! She plays her part very well as being the shy, innocent girl to full blown, kick ass hardcore woman! It's very rare that you can see an actress pull this off going from comedy to thriller. Wes Bentley was another good choice, although he's not in the film that much, he's a great actor who can make the character feel serious. The guys who play the high school boys, felt right as well. There were two that I would say that were mediocre in their performance, but the main boy Jamison and the other boy Danny put on an excellent performance.

The story was interesting. It takes a twist on what we are use to seeing (which is the guy is always stronger than the female) and flip it the other way. The only thing that bothered me with the story (SPOILER ALERT!) is at the beginning showing Abigail go through training, in a way, I can see why they did this but I also feel like they could have shown this towards the end of the film to add a bigger shock value (but I also see it from the point that people would say ""Ah...get out of here. Now she's a trained assassin and can kick their butts. Get outta here with that crap""). I don't know, I kind of have a conflict with both scenarios for that portion of the movie. But otherwise it was very well written and the dialogue doesn't feel over the top or out of place. It feels just right.

A lot of reviewers felt the film was artsy, but it felt right to be this way. I don't think that if they made this like every other movie where it was just thrown together, it wouldn't have worked. The fact they used no Special Effects or CGI makes this even better, because 99% of movies are all about CGI and Special Effects.  Everything in the movie is real, according to the Making of feature. They stated that if the actor/actress bled, they used it in the movie. If they sneezed, it was in the movie. The fact they used lighting in some of the shots to make a building, or the characters shadows or certain things pop out was incredible. They made the film feel like it was current but also set in the 50's/60's/70's.

All in all, this film is truly a hidden gem. I wouldn't say it's a horror as much as a thriller.  I'm giving it a 4 out of 5, as it would have been a perfect 5 for me, just that portion of the film that bothered me but also for the two mediocre actors. I could only hope they make a sequel at some point that would continue the story of the main characters. If you haven't seen this film yet, I would definitely recommend picking it up as it is a need to have for any movie collector/movie watcher.",1517529600,,3012,4.200692041522491
8723429,4,B0112HPVM6,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Tyler Shields, ""Final Girl"" concerns a little orphaned girl in Washington (state) who is trained by a mysterious cold man, William (Wes Bentley), in assassination techniques and the use of drugs. Veronicas first real mission is to target four pompous young guys, who are sociopathic murderers. Abigail Breslin plays the protagonist.

This is a cool meshing of films like Hanna (2011), The Hunger Games (2012) and Point of No Return (1993). The British Columbia cinematography is gorgeous and the tone is surreal, but theres not enough character exposition, which is the movies main flaw. Other than that, this is top-notch filmmaking.

Viewers complain that Breslin was wrong for the role because she wasn't cut enough and the emphasis was on how cute/attractive she appeared than on being a convincing slayer. But Veronica (Abigail) was cultivated by William (Bentley) to be an assassin, not appear on TV as a martial arts celebrity. Assassins are SUPPOSED to be inconspicuous, not openly pegged as merciless killers. That's why William had her dressed in pretty dresses, etc. She wasn't supposed to look like a kick axx assassin. Its the same reason Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) was picked by high command for his mission in Apocalypse Now (1979).

To help understand the movie, reflect on the spotlights in the forest. They weren't just there to give an artsy feel; Final Girl is darker and cleverer than that. Veronicas parents died and she was instantly recruited by a trainer who taught her classic MK Ultra programming (an infamous CIA mind control program). She learns about drugs and techniques in how to seduce and slay.

The sociopathic dudes enjoy hunting women in the woods for sport. While the overall way its portrayed is not realistic, it recalls royal families in England and elite families in America back in the day who would hunt individuals for sport and ritual. Consider Jimmy Savile who allegedly supplied kids from shelters for noble and exclusive families in Europe. This is where the concept of The Hunger Games hails. Its reality. Elitist snobs would hunt youths for fun and have them fight to the death for sport.

Another obvious flaw is: How could the young lads get away with murdering myriad innocent girls for so long, particularly when you consider how overt they are about luring the prey into their web. Moreover, one of these ignoramuses wouldve surely spilled the beans at some point, but they're all so cavalier about their dirty deeds. If the handler (Bentley) knows about their diabolical frolics in the woods, wouldnt the police?

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. WRITERS: Adam Prince wrote the script based on a story by Johnny Silver, Stephen Scarlata & Alejandro Seri.

8723432,2,B0112HPVM6,"I admire the cast and the intent of the film, but this was really disappointing. There was no character development or depth, no catharsis, no moment of tension, twists or pay-offs. They tried to do some stuff in places, but it was completely amateurish.

The whole thing just goes exactly much how you think it's going to go from the trailer. The opening scene, ""training"" and fights were just boring and stupid. There are only two acts in the film: (1) She gets trained (2) the plan gets carried out.

They could have saved this if it had been paced differently. If it started off with Veronica in the diner, seeming like a normal, innocent girl, then once she gets chased we flashback and see that she's more than what she appears... Maybe that would have helped.

Overall, it was like a second-year film student somehow got access to recognizable actors and a decent film crew.",1509321600,,881,4.634615384615385
