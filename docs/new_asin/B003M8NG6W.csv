4154854,2,B003M8NG6W,"Not at all what I expected after the unexpected masterpiece that was ""Big Money Hustlas"".  You have your standard Western prodigal son storyline, only absolutely none of the genre gags you'd expect.  No decent bar-fights, no posse chasing a bad guy, no hangings, no passing the same rock 5 times, no singing cowboy, no spaghetti western soundtrack and really no one to root for (aside from maybe Dirty Sanchez).  Possibly the problem here is maybe Violent J wasn't as big a fan of westerns (of any era) as he was of 70's cop movies.

There was also a noticeable lack of the self-aware humor that made Hustlas so much fun.  All we're left with is a fairly straightforward western plot, only with goofy ""assassins"" thrown in.  Sugar Wolf was almost completely unlikeable as the ""good"" guy,  not even close to Sugar Bear's nonchalant, pimp-daddy cool.  Big Baby Chips really didn't have much to do aside from bounce lines off Twiztid.  Twiztid, again, stole the whole movie, only this time around, they just had to go pick it up off the floor where the rest of the crew left it.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I bought it as soon as the newsletter hit my inbox announcing it for sale.  But wow, what a disappointment.  Watch it if you have to, but, seriously, if you want to have a good time, just watch Big Money Hustlas again.

Nice to see The Bad Guy, though.  Cash that check, Scotty!",1283212800,8,1392,4.534136546184739
4154855,1,B003M8NG6W,"I bought this movie expecting to finally learn how magnets work. Sadly, after its conclusion magnets remain one of the great mysteries of the universe.",1282867200,31,151,5.08
4154856,5,B003M8NG6W,"10 years ago, Big Money Hustlas exploded on the Juggalo scene. When I finally bought it, I was upset that it sucked so much. I just didn't think it was funny at all. It was just friends messing around and not even acting.

But 10 years later... they have perfected their craft. Everyone does a really great job at acting on this one, it actually feels like a movie. It's very funny and has great, original scenes. Sometimes it felt like a cartoon with the way Jamie Madrox would act. Eyes popping out of his head, him jumping up at random things happening, etc. Cameos are abundant all through this film, and they are pretty cool.

Violent J's acting still sounds forced at times, but Shaggy got it down. He's got that country accent with the funny wolf howl. He took it seriously even though he looked drunk in some scenes with his red eyes.

I wanna say more but you should just watch it for yourself. You'll be laughing at how women get treated as property all throughout the film. The midget woman is hot, too.

Pick it up, Juggalo or not. It's an old west romp that won't soon be forgotten.

I must also mention Monoxide. He stole the show with his hilarious antics. The dude just knows how to have a good time.",1282176000,12,1216,4.3628318584070795

4154858,5,B003M8NG6W,"Ok First off if your not a juggalo, this movie won't make any sense to you. A good place to learn how to be a juggalo is to pick yourself up some Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Anybody Killa (ABK), Blaze ya dead homie, Boondox, Axe Murder Boyz, Dark Lotus and Dj Clay CDs. Listen and learn and become apart of the family. O and don't forget a 2 liter of faygo! WHOOP WHOOP.  I was fortunate enough to go to the film premiere with a couple of my juggalo and juggalette friends in Detroit January 23 2010.  Now it was a whole different experience than seeing them perform live at Hallowicked which is amazing and if there is any ninja out there who hasent been to Hallowicked ya'll need to experiance it or just see them on tour and perform.
We stood outside the filmore anxiously waiting for the family to show up.  They all rolled in at different times in these fresh looking black limos.  They had the red carpet outside for them to walk on and everything. Once we got inside we headed up to the mezzazonian section of the theater and hung out with the bands. It was such an amazing feeling to chill with them and cut it up.  Now a huge reason why I support this film and these actors/performers is because they are not like your typical Hollywood actors. Tell me how many hollywood performers would hold a private party like they all did and and actually walk around with their fans?  These guys don't play and i quote Violent J ""Mister Famous Trash"" where they don't care about the fans, just as long as they make their money they are happy. NO! these guys are thankful for all their fans and they realize if there weren't Juggalos and Juggaletts out there they wouldnt be where they are today.  ICP came up from little to nothing living in Detroit.  But each year They come back and perform at hallowicked and they hosted the film premiere in Detroit. They never forgot or left behind where they came from. These bands are the real deal. They care about their fans and they always come back home.
Ok now to the film. It's short and simple to explain. If you are a juggalo you will love this film. but if you have no idea who ICP or what a juggalo is, this film will clue you in. They put a lot of money into this project. Even though they are my favorite rap group i have a huge appreciation for film. I have seen many independent films. But this is by far the best one i have ever seen.  Paul Andresen did an amazing job directing this film.  Its a western comedy and it has their music within the film. I highly reccomend going to youtube and watching the trailer. Now if you are a juggalo chances are your not even reading this and you have already clicked add to cart and proceded to checkout and are anxiously awaiting this to come in the mail. I guarantee you won't be able to find this at your local video store to rent.  These guys are underground. I don't think i need to say any more. Juggalos...whats our signal?

4154937,1,B003M8NG6W,"Nowhere near as funny or entertaining as their first movie.  Big Money Hustlas was just a funny, stupid, low budget bad gangster movie that didn't even try to take itself seriously.  However that was basically what made it fun.  This movie is just bad.  The characters are exactly the same except they're not as funny.  Twiztid were the best part of the first movie but they didn't do much of anything this time around.  The jokes and gags weren't as funny in this one either.  Also they clearly spent some money to have a cinematic-sounding musical score which I think was a mistake.  It would have worked much better if they had just used a bunch of Mike E. Clark beats like in the first one.  I'm glad this movie finally got made, and it's worth watching once if you've been waiting for it.  However I don't personally think it had the same flavor and humor as the first one.  Just my opinion, though.",1469750400,2,904,4.451219512195122

4155041,5,B003M8NG6W,I checked this movie out because I do like ICP. It was really funny if you like goofy slapstick comedies. If your expecting an oscar winning performance your going to be disapointed. I smoke so maybe that helped me give this a 5 but I thought the movie was greatness. My favorite part is probably the part where he is learning to use his left hand while churing butter. some funny lines there.,1365033600,,393,4.397260273972603

The dialog had some clever moments, and some lame jokes.  The overall plot was a fairly good story.  It breezed along joyfully.  If you sometimes enjoy mindless slapstick and aren't bothered by really nasty stuff, give it a shot.

If you're thinking about buying ""Big Money Rustlas"" I'd say go for it. The core group of characters are ture to who they were in the first one without doing exactly the same thing. It was different enough to be new and inventive, while still having the same quick timed banter from the first one. Tons of laughs, tons of cameos. You really don't have to be an ICP fan to enjoy this movie, it helps of course to get all of the jokes, but it's just funny.
