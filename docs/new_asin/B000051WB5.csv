1387491,5,B000051WB5,"This is by far one of 1 of best slashers of the 80s. Rarely seen with very gory kill scenes. My favorite is where this girl gets mutilated with a big fish hook right between her legs wow!  Haven't seen that in a movie since.  To back up very simple plot.  College coeds head to beach house for weekend get away and get chopped to pieces by a psycho lurking in the garage.  You have decapitation, chainsaw, body parts chopped off and my favorite. Why this is not on usa DVD is beyond me.  This needs blu ray treatment before it slips into absolute obscurity. Thankfully I have the unrated VHS. This is definitely a must see 5 stars.

But when you see how they have gems that were filmed on such a low budget on virtually on garbage put into HD plus all the extras, you wouldn't have a problem paying double!!

1387606,5,B000051WB5,"In the 80's there were so many types of horror movies(including slashers) to choose from.  Some went their own way to be creative and original and others just simply either attempted to ride on the coattails of the more popular ones thereby totally stealing another's ideas or just doing so in part.  Either idea would give the audience either a great fresh concept to be enjoyed or a ridiculous attempt to steal another horror movies thunder and in turn you get a trainwreck.  Once in a while one of those horror movies will allow the audience a tremendous pay-off by using the all too familiar formulas but still managing to be its own movie.  Well The Mutilator aka Fall Break proves to be one of those such horror/slashers that still manages to hold its own even if the formula is a familiar one.  Consistency is a great thing to have in any great work of art,  I say.

Some facts:  The Mutilator's original title was ""Fall Break"".  It was produced and written by Buddy Cooper.  It was directed by Buddy Cooper and co-directed by John S. Douglass.  It was released directly to video on January 4, 1985 in both R-rated and Unrated versions by Vestron.  The cinematography is by Peter Schnall.  The music is by Michael  Minard.  The special effects were done by Mark Shostrom and the make up special effects were done by Anthony Showe.

The movie starts with this young kid simply referred to as Ed Jr who is cleaning his father, Big Ed's guns as a birthday surprise.  As his mother is making a birthday cake for Big Ed in the kitchen, Ed Jr accidentally fires one of the guns and ends up killing his mother.  Once Big Ed returns home to see what has happened he's never the same again.  Years later as Ed Jr is all grown up and estranged from his father of whom never forgave Ed Jr for what happened, Ed and his friends are on Fall Break from college and just as they couldn't think of a way to spend it, Big Ed calls his son to come to his beach condo to clean and close it up for the winter.  They all go to help Ed Jr and to party, but unfortunately an unexpected guest is single-handedly offing Ed's friends while they're there.

While I totally hated that annoying Fall Break theme song, I did love the score used for the movie.  It perfectly captured the exact mood of all of the scenes that it's used.  The score has a romantic sound, a happy sound, and a menacingly creepy sound that works perfectly with the appropriate scenes.

The kill scenes and the gore are both magnificently done by by Shostrom and Showe.  There's a scene where one of the characters is killed with an outboard motor, a awesomely done scene of one of the victims being decapitated, also there's a character that gets impaled against a door through the throat with a pitchfork.  That's just a couple of examples of this movies brilliantly realistic gore scenes and the awesomeness of the kill scenes.  There's not alot of stalker element(s) but how these scenes are handled and wonderfully edited makes up for it.

While the DvD transfer is nothing special the Blu-Ray transfer is beautifully rendered and incredibly clear.  The sound quality is at its best also.

Unfortunately there's not much in the way of nudity, but the nudity you get is very sweet.

The characters are all very interesting and likable to the point where you'll actually find yourself caring about them and feeling sorry that they get killed.  The guys are cool, relatable, and some are funny and the women are gorgeous, smoking hot, and really loyal to their friends as much as the guys are.

All in all, if you love a good slasher and you love brilliantly done gone and kill scenes, sexy and attractive people, characters that you actually care about, plenty of shocking and scary moments, an effective score, beautiful scenery and a very beautiful location by the same token, then this 80's slasher is definitely for you.",1460332800,6,3881,4.562138728323699

1387612,5,B000051WB5,"Review was originally written for my site From the Mind of Tatlock. A copy of the movie was provided for review.

1984 gave rise to quite a few quality slashers. You had such classics as Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and to me at least, Silent Night, Deadly Night. Today, however, isn't about those little hits, but instead, it's about the even littler guy, the low budget slasher known as The Mutilator (aka Fall Break). Directed by Buddy Cooper, a man who loved slasher films and just wanted to make a fun movie, The Mutilator is a hidden '80s horror gem; it provides the gore, a bit of nudity and a fun vibe throughout the 86-minute runtime. What more can you ask for in a slasher flick? It was nearly impossible to see a nice copy of the uncut version of The Mutilator, but thankfully Arrow Video searched and searched for the full uncut version, cleaned it up and provided us with an amazing Blu-ray release, packed to the gills with special features.

THE MUTILATOR

The Mutilator is something else. After the initial opening story setup involving a child named Ed cleaning a rifle for his dad's birthday and accidentally shooting his mother with more precision than a trained sniper, we jump ahead a few years to catch up with the little boy, now a full-grown college kid. The movie then proceeds to play out like an '80s sitcom, with a theme song that will drive you utterly insane. Ed, along with a group of friends are heading out to his dad's condo to close it up for the winter and you can be rest assured that hijinks are going to happen. We're going to see the kids play monopoly and drinking games. They are going to make out and fool around. They are going to run on the beach, whilst the instrumental version of the theme song drives even further into your brain. It's a rather bizarre, albeit unique setup for a slasher film, but in the end, The Mutilator is just that, a slasher. It keeps the locations small, utilizing the condo effectively, and providing a nice reason why it's difficult to call for help (the condo is on an island and the police are across the bridge.) The movie also effectively flips the protagonists around halfway through, which is something you rarely see in a slasher film.

The killer (who's identity is never hidden) systematically picks off the college kids with a variety of fishing instruments, usually in a gratuitously gory fashion. The one kill that instantly comes to mind is a gaff being shoved in a place you don't want a gaff shoved. It's a rather obscene visual, but it's the hook (no pun intended) that will sell the gorehounds on the movie. Mark Shostrom (Evil Dead II) provides the gory practical effects, which are the main star of the film.

The Mutilator has its faults, as the acting is sketchy at times (what slasher film of the 80s didn't have sketchy acting?) and there are moments where suspense is non-existent, such as the hide and seek game where budget constraints hamper the scenes, as it's clear they had to shoot the sequence bright and have the actors pretend it's pitch black. The scene still works in the end, but the suspense goes out the window when you end up laughing instead of cowering.

However, the movie still succeeds, as it's the passion and dedication that went into making the movie that makes The Mutilator a wonderful little slasher to have on your movie shelf. Buddy Cooper wanted to get out there and make a slasher movie and he succeeded beautifully.

BLU-RAY OPINION

It's been a long time coming since it's announcement by Arrow Video back in June of 2015, but we can finally get our bloody hands on the Blu-ray release of The Mutilator, and boy is it a beauty. Arrow Video has lovingly restored the video, resulting in a fantastic presentation. There are a few moments of a weird halo effect happening on characters and objects in the scene, however, it only happens a few times (the provided photo below shows you the weird effect in play). Besides that, everything else is wonderfully top notch looking. The same goes for the audio, which includes the movie in it's original uncompressed PCM Mono 1.0 presentation.

The special features are going to take you awhile to get through, but they are all worth it. My favorite is the feature-length documentary on the making of the movie, which features several interviews with cast and crew. You can tell that everyone had a great, albeit stressful time making this little gem. Everyone seems to be game for a sequel as well! Other features included are two commentaries, more interviews with special effects crew and the composer, who oddly enough, doesn't apologize for the theme song. Rounding everything out is behind the scenes footage, trailers, screen tests, storyboards and so on. It's a boatload of stuff and all of it is absolutely wonderful.

VERDICT

Arrow Video deserves a big pat on the back with this one. I never even saw the film before, but now I have an amazing Blu-ray of it in my hand, in it's full uncut and bloody glory. It is truly a wonderful time to be a slasher fan. The Mutilator deserves all the praise I can give it and then some. A no brainer pick up.",1457740800,4,5162,4.612200435729847
1387613,4,B000051WB5,"One thing up front, The Mutilator doesn't exactly re-invent the slasher genre - nor does it intend to ... but it still works quite well within formula limitations, choosing a slowburn approach to things but building up tension throughout, using classic suspense routines to full painful effect, but also delivering in terms of gory pay-off and inventive murder scenes. Now admittedly, I'd be hard-pressed to call this movie a classic, as I don't think it is one in the traditional meaning of the word - but it's lots of fun, and it's one of the films that clearly show why old school slashers are nowadays considered as quite that enjoyable!",1457654400,,641,4.836363636363636

1387615,5,B000051WB5,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

As a college student I was there when the slasher genre began with first HALLOWEEN and then FRIDAY THE 13TH. After graduation I managed a theater where I had the chance to see a number of the subsequent low budget attempts to mind for gold in the genre released. Most were not bad but a majority of them were not worth seeking out once home video erupted. One that played in my theater did fairly decent business but nothing stupendous. I watched it one afternoon and thought it was one of the better movies to come out. After that Id forgotten about it, another in the long list of movies that have faded from my memory.

When I heard that THE MUTILATOR was being released by Arrow Video I was excited at the news. First because I knew that Arrow would treat the movie right and secondly because I remembered it being one of the better slasher movies. Well Arrow has treated it right and my memory of how good the movie is was a correct one, perhaps better than I recalled.

The story opens with a young boy, Ed, accidentally shooting and killing his mother while polishing his fathers gun collection. The father, Big Ed, returns and blames the boy, going mad in the process. Fast forward to years later and the Ed (Matt Mitler) is now a college student as fall break approaches. Along with his friends they have no plans and are bored. When his father calls to ask him to go to their beachfront condo to lock it down for the winter, his friends are happy to go with him turning a chore into a fun weekend at the beach while on break.

As luck would have it the three couples arrive to find the place a shambles. With the place to themselves they don't care and set about cleaning it up. Unknown to them is the fact that Big Ed is hidden in the back area of the garage, still a bit off his rocker after all these years. Knowing slasher films we know immediately that it won't be long before Big Ed begins to attack the youngsters. Thats one of the things that sets this film apart from many others in the genre. While most had a surprise killer leading you to believe it was one person instead of the most obvious, THE MUTILATOR tells you up front who the killer is and goes forward from there.

The weekend continues and much beer is downed, hookups are planned and games are played. Of course there is a virgin among this group, one of the tried and true plot devices from the genre. And we know ahead of time that if anyone survives it will be her. What is interesting is to see who else does or doesnt survive.

The other thing that fans of the genre always rely on is not just that people are killed but the way they are killed. Kill scenes and gore scenes can make or break a slasher picture. THE MUTILATOR delivers on all counts with some of the most gruesome kills on screen, enough so that when presented for release several scenes had to be cut first to get an R rating. Those scenes have been reinserted here for the most complete version of the film ever offered. One involving a fish gaff will leave you cringing even now 32 years after the film was first released.

What sets this film apart from many others though isn't just the kill scenes or location. Its the fact that the movie offers a higher quality product than many of its contemporaries offered at the time. I can remember slasher films that had some of the worst acting, some that had blood squirt out in such high pressured torrents that there was no way they could have come from the victim and some that were so intent on red herrings (false leading clues) that they ended up making no sense whatsoever. This film tells you up front who the killer is, why hes doing it and then lets things fall where they may, or at least bodies fall where ever. The acting is better than many of those films in the genre. Perhaps not Oscar worthy but at least believable for the most part. The characters are cardboard cutouts but defined enough that you care for them. The killer is one of the most dangerous and deadly ever filmed but sympathetic because of the circumstances that brought him where he is. All of these things combined make this one of the better films in the genre and its great that it has been saved by Arrow Video.

If all of this weren't enough to make this worth seeking out Arrow has done a tremendous job of putting together a fantastic version of the film AND noteworthy extras. The film is a 2K restoration using original vault materials. It has an introduction from director Buddy Cooper and assistant make-up artists/editor Edmund Ferrell. There is audio commentary tracks with Cooper, Ferrell, co-director John Douglass and star Matt Mitler as well as another audio commentary track featuring Cooper and star Ruth Martinez Tutterow. A feature length documentary on the making of the film, FALL BREAKERS: THE STORY OF THE MUTILATOR is included, FALL BREAK being the original title of the film. MUTILATOR MEMORIES, an interview with effects coordinator Mark Shostrum. TUNES FOR THE DUNES, an interview with musical composer Michael Minard. A behind the scenes reel. Screen tests. Alternate opening titles. The Fall Break theme song. Opening sequence storyboards. A still gallery. Even a copy of the script for the film accessible as BD/DVD-ROM content is here. Is this an amazing amount of extras for what many would consider nothing more than a slasher film or what?!?!?

After watching the movie I found myself with a smile on my face. No Im not some ghoul who enjoys seeing young people slaughtered. But in watching the movie I was taken back to a time when theaters didn't just flood multiscreen theaters with the same movie on half of their screens but were willing to offer at least one for little known or low budget films. A time when you could see something that was well made and entertaining without it having to be a huge blockbuster. A time when a horror movie didn't have to feature million dollar CGI effects and yet could still make it look more realistic than those coming out today. That Arrow Video has brought this movie back from the past and made it seem like something new is an amazing feat and they should be applauded for doing so. When the Rondo Awards come out this year Im hoping that this film is not only nominated but a big winner. It is just that good.",1456876800,,6335,4.477922077922078
1387616,3,B000051WB5,"It says that I'm not a verified purchaser of this set but I was able to order this release directly from Arrow which came along with a Limited Edition Slip (I believe it's limited to 1000 copies, but don't quote me on it) which doesn't feel cheap [I don't know how else to describe the high quality of the slip].  This is another great package from Arrow with an excellent making-of feature length documentary that never gets boring.  However, the transfer is disappointing but Arrow have done the best they could with the time, money and the materials available to them; a 35mm master print.  The following comes from the booklet:
""... there are still noticeable instance of damage on the picture and soundtrack that are in keeping with the condition of the source elements. There are also instances in which the original print was mistimed during lab printing, which resulted in some sections of the films cast in blue.  We have worked to correct the colour for these sections as much as possible""

The frustrating thing is that this problem doesn't come up for a frame or two, but with a full reels, which is around 15 minutes. and that can take you out of the film.  What you see on the left hand side of the frame, say 5% to 10% of the full image, is fading with a red tint.

If it wasn't for the problems with the transfer this would be another 5 star release from Arrow (that's not taking the quality of the actual film), however fans of the film or horror genre will enjoy the full package but you might want to wait for a sale.  The negative of doing this is the risk of missing out on the slip, if that's what you are into.",1456790400,,1633,4.3841059602649
1387617,1,B000051WB5,"This is a terrible movie, and did not deserve a blu-ray release.  It's a very complete package (which is usual for Arrow Films) with both DVD and Blu-ray, full restoration, and a truckload of extras.  There's even a large booklet.  But this is all a shameful waste of resources.  There is nothing good about this movie.  It's boring, not scary, not much gore, terrible acting, terrible soundtrack that doesn't even fit the story, very ugly actresses, and not even any unintentional comedy.  There's no mystery about who the killer is and the killings are clumsily staged and badly filmed.  Nothing even happens until well past the half way mark, and the blood even looks fake.  It's widely believed that this movie was made in 1983 but it looks much more like a late-80s shot-on-video film.  I believe the booklet was written by someone involved with making the movie, maybe the director himself, because no one in their right mind could ever give this movie the degree of praise that is written in the booklet.  It's about 26 pages of how original the plot is, how scary it is, how gory it is, etc. and it's all 100% lies.  It's bottom-of-the-barrel junk, and no one involved with it has any talent whatsoever.  I'm really glad these people never made another movie.  There's not one known actor in it, and hopefully they never made another movie either.

Arrow releases are high quality and expensive.  Much care is put into them.  They've released classics like Blood Rage and What Have You Done to Solange.  But to waste a high-quality release on a crap movie like this one is criminal.  I'd advise fans of slasher films to stay well away from this movie.  This is in the same category as Madman, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Nightmare in a Damaged Brain - all movies made by idiots who do not even have a rudimentary knowledge of film making, script writing, or even how to use a camera.  They probably got high, bought a cheap camcorder and skipped high school one day to make their movies.  This is one of the worst of the 80s slasher films, and among the worst horror movies of all time.  As a viewer I'm insulted that this kind of garbage gets released.",1456531200,3,2172,4.587012987012987

A group of youngsters take a fall break to an empty family condo on the beach, they intended it to be a weekend of sex drinking and fun but it turns in a nightmare when they start to be horribly murdered one by one, being a remote place with hardly anyone around will anyone survive!!

This is certainly and amazing Arrow Blu-ray release of probably one of the more outrageous and genius slasher movies of the 80's, an easy to follow story that has a simple set up right from the start, a cool cast of youngsters lined up for the slaughter, your usual stereotype cool dudes and hot girls, the movie is a little predictable and some of the acting is cheesy but the lavish gore effects keep you drawn to these types of movies, and the brutal kill sequences in this movie are very well done indeed, plenty of blood and limbs everywhere, this movie has been passed uncut and is the full unrated version. If you love classic 80's slashers this is a must have on the list!!

1387619,5,B000051WB5,"Presented in the right context, The Mutilator (also known as Fall Break, a title Arrow Video preserves in its transfer) can resemble a teen comedy popular at the time of the films release; in 1984, the slasher genre was in full swing, but so were raunchy comedies like Porkys, Revenge of the Nerds, and Spring Break. With its catchy theme song Fall Break from Peter Yellen and the Breakers and the way the title credits hint at a Weekend at Bernies-style vacation, The Mutilator could easily be mistaken for a much more lighthearted affair, one where a shadowy killer doesnt stalk and murder our protagonists with very large and inventive fishing gear.

Thats kind of the point, too, or at least it unintentionally works in the films favor. Writer/director Buddy Cooper focuses on the playful humor of six kids at the beginning of the film, all of them gearing up for what seems to be a fun jaunt to a beach house to close up Ed Jr.s (Matt Mitler) fathers cottage, and Cooper makes the most of his comedic cast members  like Bill Hitchcock as the jokester Ralph  to get the fun started. The Mutilator is, for much of its opening arc besides the initial accidental murder of Eds mother, an entertaining romp full of drinking and driving while enjoying the freedom of the open air in a convertible.

But Cooper slowly infuses the film with a pervasive sense of dread after the kids get to the beach house. The film makes no attempts to hide its serial killer from the audience; instead, Cooper quickly establishes Eds father (Jack Chatham) as the killer with shadowy shots of him hiding in the beach houses basement, silhouetted by light filtering in through the slats. And just like its slasher predecessors before it, The Mutilator establishes virginity and chastity as its main themes, consistently drawing attention to the lack of sexuality between Ed Jr. and his girlfriend Pam (Ruth Martinez) while the others hump in the bushes like rabbits.

Its easy to see the similarities between other slasher films of the time, but The Mutilator consistently manages to feel fresh despite the cliches Cooper includes in his script. The formula itself doesnt really change  weve got kids drinking and sexing, and a killer that slowly kills them off one by one while presenting their bodies for a final gallery of horrors. But Coopers risky tonal shifts  from wacky to scary  often leave The Mutilator feeling like an off-kilter ride, a roller coaster of emotions that feels uncomfortable once the brutality and ultraviolence seeps into the plot. The film is most well-known because of its censorship and the excision of a particularly horrible scene of genital mutilation, but The Mutilator keeps its killings well-concealed until they actually occur.

In truth, this is probably not an intentional choice  the use of Fall Break as a theme song is probably due to the proliferation of these upbeatfall break songs in this style of movie. The Mutilator in particular, though, offers a surprisingly duplicitous juxtaposition; its characters, doing little harm besides the sinful act of engaging in intercourse out of wedlock, are likable and funny, and their murders are so horrifyingly displayed that the film becomes even more disturbing.

With that said, The Mutilator is not a particularly good film  its acting is mediocre at best, and the writing often borders on humorous unintentionally. Detractors of the slasher genre will probably not find anything here to interest them besides an amusing scene where the kids play Blind Mans Bluff  a drinking game version of hide-and-seek, I guess  where they stumble through a clearly well-lit house as though the rooms are pitch black. The violence has some good effects, but for contemporary audiences, the gore probably won't impress or offend as it did at the time of the release even with the censored scene added.

But for fans of slasher film, The Mutilator is undoubtedly intriguing. Intentional or not, Cooper plays up the irony of the films happy-go-lucky characters in a way thats more effective than some of the other, lesser-known films in the genre. Theres a reason that The Mutilator has become a cult classic of sorts, and its not just because of its cut fish hook sequence; the way that Cooper switches back and forth between teen comedy humor and intense horror provides a viscerally manipulative experience.

Special Features

For starters, its great to have The Mutilator on Blu-Ray. I had seen it once before, but it was a poor-quality VHS rip; Arrow Videos transfer looks fantastic save for a couple of small film flaws and the presence of a red light on the left side of the screen at times. The dark lighting loses a little of its definition, but other than that this is a great-looking release restored from original vault elements  along with the cut scenes including the infamous fish hook murder. The audio is presented as uncompressed PCM on the Blu-Ray version, and sounds fairly clear. The dialogue is a little flat at times, but Fall Break never sounded so good.

The bonus features is where this disc really excels, though. The Mutilator menu features footage from the film cut to look like a party comedy rather than a horror film, with Fall Break playing overtop of it. Theres a full-length series of interviews with Buddy Cooper, John Douglass, Matt Mitler, Edmund Ferrell, Bill Hitchcock, Jack Chatham, and Ruth Martinez called Fall Breakers that really gets to some in-depth information about the making of the film; this is about an hour and 15 minutes long, and its a well-made production from Arrow Video that drives up the value of this collection. Along with that are two audio commentaries  one from Cooper, Ferrell, Douglass, and Mitler, and one from Cooper and Martinez.

Also included is an interview with special effects artist Mark Shostrom, about 15 minutes long, where he goes into great detail about the effects in the film, most notably the blood-filled condoms that help create the fish hook scene. An interview with composer Michael Minard  about 8 minutes long  tells of how Fall Break made it into the film. We also get an instrumental and full version of Fall Break.

A half-hour behind-the-scenes reel is included, not vital viewing but a nice addition. And screen tests, alternate opening title sequence (with The Mutilator in the credits instead of Fall Break), a gallery, opening sequence storyboards, the full screenplay, and trailers round out this massive package, a true collectors dream. There are hours of features to browse, and Arrow Video has really given this the works  even with reversible cover art.

Any fan of The Mutilator will definitely want to pick up this 2-disc set from Arrow Video  its great to have the flick on Blu-Ray, but with all of the extras included, you really cant go wrong. If you miss this, you deserve an outboard motor to the chest.",1456272000,12,6870,4.910189982728843
1387620,5,B000051WB5,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ahthe good ol 80s slasher flick.  Does cinema get much better?  Well, of course it does.  But you cant deny the fun these throwback films offer up regardless.  THE MUTILATOR is one of these obscure treasures, and it was recently given a Blu-ray release by the fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD Distribution.  If youve never visited this film before, now is the time to do so.  Chocked full of typical teenage hijinks and some very nice gore, this is one 80s slasher every horror fan needs to own.

I was very surprised to discover this film was the only movie director Buddy Cooper ever did.  From what I can see onscreen, the man had talent as a filmmaker, and Im curious as to why he never did anything else.

THE MUTILATOR is shot well (for a slasher) and looks good overall.  The 2K restoration looks amazing, and once again helps preserve an aging classic for later generations to enjoy.  Likewise, the audio is crisp and clear.  Unfortunately, this means the viewer has to endure the horrid opening theme song in stereo.  I say this lightly, because the quality of the song sounds greatits just the song itself that is atrocious.  This might not make sense, but once you hear the song, youll know what I mean.

The acting in the film is typical lower-budget slasher fare.  This is not a negative, but I will say none of the cast will win any awards with their roles.  Part of this is due to a clunky script.  But the other part is thanks to wooden, cardboard performances.

The special effects in THE MUTILATOR are excellent for the most part.  They are realistic and vibrant.  Blood spurts in crimson fountains and appendages fly.  But the sole negative in regard to the gore is a single scene where young Ed. Jr. gets his throat slashed; the special effects are very poor in this shot, and it is obvious they are fake.  Otherwise, the carnage is top notch.

Overall, I give THE MUTILATOR a big thumbs up, and I highly recommend it.  Arrow Video and MVD Distribution once again deliver exactly what horror fans want.  In addition to the film, the Blu-ray comes with a host of nice extras.  The film is available now, so grab your copy quick!",1456185600,2,2222,4.473815461346633
1387621,5,B000051WB5,A must have. Clear crisp blu Ray. I feel so old I saw this at a $1 cheapie movie theatre as a kid,1456012800,,97,3.260869565217391
1387622,3,B000051WB5,"The Mutilator (1984) is a late-to-the-party slasher that garnered more fans from its oversized VHS artwork than it probably ever did from those who watched the finished product.  And who could blame them.  Put together by a cast and crew of mostly amateurs, the photography was so dark, the theme song (based on the original title Fall Break) so horrifically misguided, and the killer so unthreatening that the film could barely compete with TV horror fare.

But the years have been kind to director Buddy Cooper's wannabe production.  And Arrow Video's high-definition restoration has been even kinder.  The overall ineptitude is still there, but now The Mutilator feels like a charming ""lets-put-on-show"" slasher fan film, full of innocently horny victims waiting for their turn in the make-up chair.

After a stagey prologue in which 8-year-old Ed Jr. accidently kills his mom with a shotgun, we flash forward to the college years where he has seemingly put the incident behind him.  But Big Ed, his father, definitely has not.  With nothing better to do over fall break, Ed Jr. and his friends agree to drive down to the family beach house and help shut it down for the season.  But instead of the cheap beer and unprotected sex they were expecting, Ed Jr. and his friends are gruesomely dispatched one by one by an array of convenient weaponry.

The Mutilator, like most other Halloween-come-latelys, is made up of pre-fab characters:  the ineffective male hero, the comic relief, the final girl and the mute murderer punishing them for their sins.  Only the setting and the number of expendable characters change from film to film.  And it's that fill-in-the-blank format that makes slashers so satisfying.  This time around, there's really no effort to hide the identity of Big Ed, who sleeps inside the nooks and crannies of the beach house like some hibernating X-Files monster, emerging only to kill with whatever is handy, including a outboard motor and (in the movie's most infamous scene) a nasty-looking gaffers hook.

The effects by Mark Shostrom, who moved on to some of the best practical gore films of the '80s like the Nightmare on Elm Street series and Evil Dead II, up the ante as the film moves along.  But ironically, the gaff sequence pushes the envelope too far, turning a rather amiable slasher into something more mean-spirited than its creators probably intended.  Aside from that, The Mutilator is an easy-to-love underdog that will have you humming its oddball theme song for longer than you'll care to admit.

Arrow's Blu-ray / DVD combo is absolutely stacked with special features in addition to a miraculous hi-def transfer of the unrated cut that played only of the East Coast.  The crowning jewel of the set is the full-length documentary Fall Breakers:  The Story of The Mutilator that follows Cooper's dream of turning $86,000 into a feature film (his second choice was buying a vineyard).  It's a great companion piece and increases one's enjoyment of the film immeasurably.  As do a pair of audio commentary tracks that go along with several other featurettes focused on the effects, that unforgettable soundtrack, screen tests and more behind-the-scenes stuff.  Alternate opening titles (this version bears the Fall Break moniker), trailers, TV and radio spots and the original screenplay wrap up another special edition that is without a doubt the final word on this homegrown horror flick.",1455667200,3,3431,5.044326241134752
1387623,5,B000051WB5,"Just when I thought there can't be any more 80's slasher films I haven't seen, a great company like Arrow surprises me. The Mutilator, (originally titled Fall Break) is one such title. An obscure, zero budget film whose cover art no doubt lured many video fans to check it out, hoping for something as good (and gory) as Friday the 13th, Halloween or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I wish I could go back in time and see how this film would have stacked up back then to a young, virginal, horror lover. Now I definitely wouldn't call this film a classic like the other films mentioned, but it does have some things going for it.

The Mutilator tells the tale of young Bill, a boy who decides he'll make his dad happy by shining his shotgun for him. But whoops, he accidentally blows his mother away which causes his father to snap. Several years later, Bill gets a random call from his dad at a bar (did his dad know he frequented this bar?) to come and get his beach side house ready for the winter. So Bill's friends talk him into letting them come along for a road trip. Unfortunately, Bill's dad is still there...waiting.

First of all, I have to ask. Is Fall Break a thing? I've heard of Spring Break, Winter Break and Summer Break. But Fall Break? Is it like Thanksgiving break? I don't know why it even matters because nothing in this damn movie makes any sense. Why would a group of kids want to travel to a beach house in fall when it's too cold to go swimming? Oh wait, there is a random pool there with a heated bubble over it! That explains it. And why would Bill's dad lure his son to be slaughtered after years of being a highly functioning alcoholic who regularly hangs out with his drinking/hunting buddies? I can't answer these questions, but there is one question you are probably wondering that I can answer. Why should I watch this film? Well the answer is - GORE! For all of the film's nonsensical shortcomings, the gorey bits are expertly done by makeup maestro Mark Shostrom (Evil Dead 2, Nightmare on Elm St). Not to say that's ALL it has going for it. The characters are goofy and though I wouldn't call them loveable (or really even likeable), I didn't hate them. That's good, right? Above all though, this film is a perfect example of a first (and only) time film maker, getting some money together with a bunch of first (and only) time ""actors"" (or relatives as half of the people have the same last name as the director) and making a fun, silly horror movie. That's all it is, that's all it should be and if you take it seriously then you are missing the point.

Arrow's Blu Ray/DVD combo features pretty much everything you could ever want to know about The Mutilator. Interviews with pretty much everyone involved, commentaries, a neat booklet, great artwork...it's all here (and more). The picture quality is beyond amazing for such a low budget film and Arrow should be commended for doing this type of work on such a niche title. Full list of extras below:

1387624,4,B000051WB5,"The Mutilator starts with the accidental death of a woman when a kid named Ed Jr. is cleaning this gun. The father comes in the house and punishes the little boy. From there we fast forward many years and now we meet a group of college kids. Ed Jr. gets an invite to his fathers beach house for the weekend while he is gone. The 6 teens engage in everything you can name that teens in the 80s do. The first half hour of the film minus the opening kills does feel very reminiscent of the Vestron Video comedies you would get in that era. The film has a light tone, nothing is really deep or impactful. The acting is 80s low budget horror to a tee. Around the 40 minute mark is when the kills start to come and they are not that bad and even by todays standards look fun. There is a scene I want to point out that irked me. So you have two people who go in a pool to skinny dip.

Nothing bad there at first. But, the girl gets drowned and the guy never notices? That is not even half the issue, when the guy comes out of the pool, he does not wipe himself off but it seems he is not dripping water or wet. The other odd thing is that the teens engage in this game in the house where they are hiding from each other, but no one notices that there is someone else in the house even when they see the shoes under the table of the person walking around the house? I guess these are meant to add to the charm of this film. I did enjoy the special features I feel more than the actual film. Esp. the documentary about the making of this film. It was good to know what the mindset was, when they were making this film. This is the hidden gem on the blu ray. Any reason to buy this blu ray would be the documentary, it goes over an hour and is just really a good watch. The film itself while problematic was still a fun little slasher film that if you shut your brain off, you may enjoy. The kills alone are reason enough to watch this film. The dialogue and humor is hit and miss, but this film really does have some good kills for being a film that is over 30 years old.",1455062400,,2062,3.9806763285024154

But, if you're like me, and LOVE this type of movie, you are in for a great time.

As the movie opens we see a young boy named Ed accidentally kill his mother with one of his father's guns. Flash forward a decade or so, and Ed is now in college. He and group of friends decide to spend their Fall Break at Ed's father's beach house. Ed's father has never forgiven Ed for killing his wife, and is lying drunk, dreaming dreams of murder in the beach house basement. It's not long before Ed senior turns into ""The Mutilator"" and begins hunting down Ed Jr.'s friends.

Packed with fun, and inventive kills, ""The Mutilator"" is nifty little slasher film, that flies under the radar of most horror fans. There really isn't anything new to see here, this is just a body count movie, where the main draw is the various methods and weapons used to dispatch Ed Jr.'s friends.

1387630,4,B000051WB5,"If there really is a guidebook out there for directors to follow that reads PURE SLASHER, then the Mutilator is one of those films that fits the title to a tee.

 We have bad acting, an predictable and simple plot, and senseless violence.

 The beginning doesn't waste anytime and jumps right. A boy is accidently kills his mother, and the father goes nuts. This is a very brief segment and we flash to the ""future"" where Ed Jr. is all grown up and planning somethig for the weekend with his college buddies. His girlfriend (the virginic type) Pam, Ralph and Sue, Linda and Mike are the crowd. Lo and Behold! They decide to go to Ed's fathers cabin for as a sex/booze spree. After all, the father is supposed to be away so what can it hurt? Riiiiight.

 Put 2 and 2 together to figure out what happens next. The father wakes up to people invading his territory and with a murderous stance proceeds to take out the offenders. The killings are pretty inventive. One poor girl gets a fishing hook in the worse possible place a woman could and is then killed. Yeoch.

 Unfortunitely this is the R rated version, which is the most widely distributed, so blood/details are cut out. That sucks as this is all the kind of movie is really good for. We sure as hell aren't in it for the cardboard characters who look like they're getting their teeth pulled when they try to act! And the dark lighting is terrible and hard to adjust to.

 There's an unrated UK DVD edition out that is said to be more detailed.

 Nevertheless not a boring B slasher flick and that already brings its rating up. The deaths were cool although sort of implied, the ending was fantastic. Worth a look if it comes on the tube (yeah right!) or if available for a cheap rental fee.",1379635200,14,1746,4.421875
1387631,5,B000051WB5,"In the prologue to THE MUTILATOR, a young boy named Ed accidentally shoots his mother dead. Just then, dad (Ed sr.) returns home, and takes the whole situation rather hard. Many years later, Ed jr. is now a man, and he gets a call from dad, telling him to go to their beach condo. So, he and his five friends (3 girls, 2 guys) head for the condo. Little do they know that dad (aka: Big Ed) is hiding in the garage, and he's got a battle-axe! While the gang gets comfortable, Big Ed fantasizes about murdering his son! We get the impression that dad never quite got over the death of his wife! As night falls, the youngsters pair off, and murderous mayhem ensues. A skinny-dipping couple offers a chance for dad to work off some stress -with an outboard motor! Propeller to the chest! Yikes! A local cop happens by, only to meet up w/ Big Ed's big blade. THE MUTILATOR is a gore-filled film from 1985, complete w/ the aforementioned chest-shredding, a decapitation, and death-by-pitchfork. As such, the victims are your basic fodder. The killer is fairly interesting however. Since we already know his identity, he seems even scarier! The atmosphere goes from cheerful to bleak, and the final conflict is intense! This movie deserves to be more widely known...",1373328000,9,1259,4.650224215246637

I picked up a copy on dvd from Dragon Entertainment but it is formatted PAL. The video transfer is not the greatest in the world and the movie on a whole feels as if it were poorly lit to begin with. The plot is very standard slasher movie fare although the reason for the killer going about his business is certainly original. The death scenes are very creative and quite graphic. However, enough cannot be said of the god awful, horribly terrible song at the beginning. I would highly recommend this to any and all fans of 80s slasher movies.",1244073600,7,647,4.311475409836065

it has an ok plot with GREAT gory kills..it takes place at a somewhat deserted beach house instead of the woods.
Actually it has everything in it you want out of a slasher.
 Something Traumatic happens years earlier then FLASH to the present and you have a disgruntled maniac on the loose cutting sawing chopping hooking and hacking teenagers to death.
Sound Good? it is..
I believe that there are plans to release this on a real DVD soon..
Grab it up while you can when released.",1226966400,3,647,4.483050847457627

And shouldn't Ed Jr think its a little suspicious when his father, who had a psychotic breakdown and hasn't talked to him in years, wants him to tend to his beach house in the middle of nowhere? To quote Admiral Ackbar: ""ITS A TRAP!"" Everything that happened in this movie could have been avoided if the characters weren't so stupid. And what's with the heavy breathing during the point of view shots, he's not Michael Myers.

Maybe it's something nostalgic, but never having seen this one before I just gotta say it's utter crap. There's the accidental killing in the first couple of minutes, but then nothing until 35+ minutes into the movie, and then another long stretch before anything else. No suspense, no intriguing characters, just cool gore when it happens. Otherwise, it's best to just skip this one.

Two notes (before the credits even roll so I can't really call them ""spoilers""): (1) The dad calls the son up to close up the condo, but now the dad wants to kill him?! (It's in the description of the movie; again, not a spoiler.) Did dad suddenly decide to go bonkers for some reason?! (2) Another reason I knew I was in for trouble was the title onscreen was ""Fall Break"", not ""The Mutilator"". It also has some cheesy 70s music in it, which wouldn't be too bad except this came out in 1984. Watch at your own risk.",1514764800,,1038,4.492063492063492

This one is one of the latter. Hard to get through. Unintentionally stupid, with a predictable plot and horrid southern drawl ""acting"". Some decent attempts at gore, but mostly you'll just be laughing all the way through. If it were TRYING to be one of those ""spoof"" comedy-horrors, it could work, but they didn't commit to it, and it's clear they thought they were making a ""real"" horror movie, or not. Either way, they failed miserably due to the lack of commitment to either one. It just fails on so many levels.

The Mutilator is a slasher classic from the wonderful year of 1984. Glorious gore FX, creative kills, 80s charm, and a good looking, surprisingly capable cast. Absolutely essential for slasher con-a-sewers, and Arrow's blu is thing of beauty and excellence. The images are colorful and crisp, the slight-yet-present film grain is in tact, and the extras are plentiful, informative, and fun.

My only two gripes: The killer and the song. Killer doesn't don a mask, and his identity's never a mystery. I don't mind that. Some of my favorite slashers feature maskless murderers (Slaughterhouse, Blood Rage, Madman, Slumber Party Massacre). What bugs me is how dull the killer is. He's just...a dad with an axe. Maybe that's all he needs to be, but even the slightest quirk can lob a flat character into your memory banks for good. Sure, he's a bitter, broken, homicidal father, but none of that  emotive ammo-for-terror really translates to his screen presence. There's nothing creepy about him other than his preferred weapon of choice, a medieval-era axe.

Second gripe is the movie's theme song, Fall Break. Admittedly catchy and oozing 80s charm, the song is far too upbeat and catchy to be played as much as it is in the first few scenes of the film. For better or worse, the song WILL latch onto your lobe, hop into your skull, and get stuck bouncing around in there for DAYS.

Don't get me wrong though, The Mutilator movie is an incredibly fun slasher experience. The gore is mind-blowing, the vibe is campy and fun, and like all entertaining horror flicks, this one's worthy of repeat viewings. It belongs in your collection, and I'm happy it's part of mine.",1495238400,,1678,4.87719298245614
7929496,1,B000051WB5,"This movie stinks. I read man of  the reviews and thought sounds good! This is one of the many crappy movies you can watch for free on Amazon video. Poor camera work, really dumb story, and bad acting and special effects make this a must to miss movie!!

7929497,3,B000051WB5,"The Mutilator. With a name like that my expectations were pretty high, and while watching the film, I could almost see what it could have been. Unfortunately though, the film never realizes its full potential as a cult slasher classic.

Everything about the film just feels a little off. The kills for example: they can somewhat gruesome and the effects are generally nice, but they also just have this awkward pacing and setup that makes them more humorous than anything else. My primary complaint though is with the father. He's just a boring killer. The idea of this deranged father stalking people with a gaff has so much promise, but all he does for most of the film is shuffle around slowly and hide in the shadows. And mutilator? I guess the father does sort of mess up a few of the bodies but it's nothing we haven't seen the likes of Friday the 13th.

The entire tone is also strange and inconsistent The college kids are actually not your run of the mill slasher chuckleheads. They all have some semblance of personalities and some of the dialog is not bad, so when they ended up getting killed off by such a boring villain I was not all to happy. Most slasher films set up all the characters so that you want to see them get what they deserve, or else have such a fun/charismatic killer that you can't help but be on their side. Not so much here.

Overall, The Mutilator is more of a tease than anything else. The concept is sound and select moments of the film are almost great, but it let me down every time",1495065600,,1520,4.421428571428572
