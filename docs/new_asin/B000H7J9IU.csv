2630255,5,B000H7J9IU,"Great DVD. My title says it all, Mom Loves Groucho and You Bet Your Life.
Fun to watch the old game shows. Do wish they had a little up to date bio on each player.",1207008000,,163,3.6857142857142855
2630256,4,B000H7J9IU,"There are so many public domain DVDs of Groucho Marx's ""You Bet Your Life"" (which ran on NBC from 1950 to 1961) that duplication has become rampant. However, this Pop Flix release focuses on previously unavailable ""Best of Groucho"" episodes. These syndication prints eliminated references to  DeSoto-Plymouth - the comedy-quiz show's primary sponsor. Special guests include baseball legend Don Drysdale, author C.S. Forester and Tony Curtis' mother. Despite a flawed program menu and erratic print quality (two episodes are out-of-sync), the DVD offers plenty of classic Groucho at a terrific price.",1206316800,38,599,5.582417582417582
2630257,5,B000H7J9IU,"This is a must have! Although it is classed as a quiz show, that aspect takes a back seat to the hilarious banter between Groucho and the contestants. And what characters these people are! Of course, holding the whole show together  is Groucho himself, the master of the ad-libbed retort. But believe me, some of the contestants give him a run for his money!
This dvd will constantly bring a smile to your face and is full of wonderful surprises. We will probably never see anything like this show again so make the most of it - 14 episodes of pure enjoyment for a bargain price.",1201651200,7,579,4.462264150943396
2630258,5,B000H7J9IU,"The You Bet Your Life shows were some of the funniest shows ever done on television. The jokes and interviews are somewhat outdated, but they are good, clean fun. Groucho was ahead of his time, allowing minorities on his program, interviewing people who got their start on his show and having interviews dealing with some contaversal issues. I have seen most of the shows on the various dicks and have heard all of his radio broadcasts. Great fun and many hours of entertainmant is provided by one of the most unique personalities in entertainment history.
Groucho, we miss your humor.",1193443200,2,585,4.86
2630259,5,B000H7J9IU,"I came across this DVD as I searched for a ""funny DVD"" to keep the spirits high for a personal friend battling cancer.  I was close to getting ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" and then I opted for this.  My friend and I were both born in the late 40's and remember our parents watching ""You Bet Your Life.""  We were supposed to be in bed, but I remember the laughter.

I made the right choice with this DVD.  It is a riot.  George Fenneman is right on with his introduction:  ""The One, the Only, Groucho Marx.""  Groucho is just plain funny.  He doesn't rely on grossness, he doesn't use profanity.... he's just funny.  Watching this video is so refreshing in a day and age where the Comedy Channel is over-whelmed with 'comedians' who can't be funny without issuing a litany of racial slurs and profanities.

Hurrah for Groucho!  This is a DVD for everyone.  Young kids should watch this for a good taste of Americana over half a century old.  The rest of us can watch it and laugh and remember how much fun life used to be.",1186012800,39,1032,4.391534391534392
2630260,5,B000H7J9IU,"I ordered this and the more expensively packaged ""You Bet Your Life - The Lost Episodes"" at the same time. The ""Lost Episodes"" has 18 episodes, and this DVD has 14. ""Lost Episodes"" now costs $35 new, this one costs $7. The episodes on this are no worse than those on the more expensive set -- in fact there are some real classic moments:
- Tony Curtis's Hungarian mother, who plays with international chess Grand Master Isaac Kashdan.
- An idiosyncratic character who sings a song he wrote in Sanskrit.
- An attractive girl from ""Pakistan, India"" (my how times change!) offering a nice 1950s inter-cultural perspective.
- A guy from Jet Propulsion Laboratory who works on classified projects talking about his experience ""beating roulette wheels"".
- A fella who blows up a car tire inner tube in his mouth till it explodes.
- A beautiful nurse named Ina Anders who later went on to become a B-movie actress.
- And to top it all off, a 22-year-old Don Drysdale -- ace pitcher with the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, who would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Drysdale, together with Sandy Koufax, was part of one of the greatest starting pitching duos in baseball history -- and on this DVD, we see him win $1000 with his first wife. Unfortunately, Big D did not decide to go for the big question at the end of the show.

All in all, this DVD gives the best value I have found yet for your Groucho dollar. If they issue more of these, I will buy them.",1179792000,63,1470,4.485074626865671

2630283,4,B000H7J9IU,"EXCELLENT Budget package for any GROUCHO MARX fan. I've been on a Groucho kick lately and decided to order this package. Overall, the package arrived safely, timely and in great shape. Each disc contains abut 90 minutes of episodes -- mixed shows that don't appear to be filmed chronologically. At first viewing, the audio is a little dubious and appears to be taken from very low quality masters, but after the second episode, both the image and sound quality improve. Both discs had an ODD GLITCH and froze up very near the end. Now, my disc player is getting OLD (I'm surprised it still runs so well) and occasionally gets a bit 'sensitive' to the slightest disc flaws. Both these discs however, seemed to freeze up at almost the same time. Could mean a production problem. However, the overall price for these discs is so incredibly LOW, and overall, I had received such a long period of enjoyable material, that I feel that this package is still worth the 'risk' at these prices. I was able to get the discs to also play 'after' each 'freeze section', so to me, it really wasn't worth returning. I may have had a bad package and overall, really enjoyed this item. I will order MORE Groucho materials in the future!",1419638400,2,1219,4.622119815668203

2630301,3,B000H7J9IU,"If you grew up watching You Bet Your Life, as I did, you'll enjoy this video. However, I must say, Groucho's humor does not hold up very well in today's world. His constant ogling and demeaning of the women guests, though funny, could wear on the viewer after a while. He also belittles, interrupts, and embarrasses his guests, frequently trying to throw male and female guests together romantically, even when one or both are married. He demeans his poor announcer, George Fenneman, at every opportunity. But of course, that's Groucho.  He still ad libs some of the best funny lines that were ever on television. If you can stand his lack of political correctness, you will enjoy this DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groucho-Marx-Collection-You-Bet-Your-Life/dp/B002ID099O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groucho Marx Collection: You Bet Your Life</a>",1380672000,,889,5.9453125
2630302,4,B000H7J9IU,The shows are great and worth five stars. The sound and picture quality varies from show to show but overall rates as okay. Certainly worth having and a great price so I have to rate it 4 stars and not 3. Glad I bought it because Groucho is a one of a kind and so is this show. A great addition to the Marx Bros. movies.,1380672000,,320,3.8636363636363638
2630303,5,B000H7J9IU,"All I can say is that I googled the 1956 Plymouth Desoto push button car. I love Groucho! Did you know that ""You Bet Your Life"" was the longest running TV show?

2630304,5,B000H7J9IU,"Amazing ! Grouch can still entertain you after all these years. Sure, some of it is slightly dated, but the wit is ""ageless"". As a nostalgic trip down memory lane, it is fascinating to see the commercials of the time.

2630306,4,B000H7J9IU,These shows hold up well even 50 years after being shown. Shows you what poor quality current television is. But then people with a quick sarcastic wit like Groucho are hard to come by.,1373932800,,185,4.470588235294118
2630307,5,B000H7J9IU,Memories of watching the show as a kid. The disc shows are out of chronological order and almost all episodes are 1954 and 1955. Have you driven a Desoto lately? You'll wish you could after watching this disc.,1373673600,,209,4.526315789473684
2630308,4,B000H7J9IU,"Great collection and I really enjoyed seeing these for the first time in over thirty years...when I was young, they aired these nightly on a local television show as part of a two-hour block from 10pm to midnight.  ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" ""You Bet Your Life"" and ""Twilight Zone.""  Those were the days!

The only fly in the ointment for me is that almost all of these episodes are from 1954.  This series ran from 1950-61 and in the '70s, when I watched the reruns regularly, I noticed that the late fifties episodes were much more fun than the earlier, clunkier ones.  You may notice the difference, too:  Awful hairstyles on the guests, rather stiff and naive personalities (TV was new and I guess the contestants didn't know how to handle themselves).  By 1957, everyone looked much better (including the set itself) and the guests tended to be much younger and more interesting.

This said, there is one 1957 episode here and one 1961 episode...and the DVD manufacturer spliced 1954 commercials into the 1961 episode!  You will get to see ONE good DeSoto in all of this, though--the 1957 episode has correct '57 DeSoto commercials intact and the car really is gorgeous (unlike the pokey looking '54 model on display in all the other episodes).

There are some laugh-out-loud moments here, thanks to Groucho and his reparte with guests...most notably a highly eccentric old man from ""Kaaansaaaaas"" who actually creeps Groucho out with his weirdness, with hilarious results.  Groucho's mimicry of this contestant at one point is priceless!",1371513600,4,1551,4.94980694980695

2630311,5,B000H7J9IU,"Groucho's wisdom, wit, and impish personality conveniently beam forth once more on your TV flatscreen or computer laptop.  Watch this seasoned comic genius as his puns, double-entendres, and devil-making are unleashed on the unsuspecting ""contestants""/victims of his quiz show.  Of course, one soon discovers that the quiz game itself is only the vehicle for this masterful comic's on-air shenanigans.  Enjoyable as well are the commercials, topics, and attire from the golden era of early television. Superb Amazon pricing make this an even sweeter indulgence!",1363219200,,561,5.654761904761905

It is peppered with Groucho's one-liners and off-color jokes. A great example is in the first episode, where both contestants write poetry. Groucho says, I wrote a poem once it goes like this:

""There was a dog lying on a train track.
A train is coming.
BEEP BEEP
Sausages.""

That having been said, I don't think this is a good buy for someone who is interested more from a gameshow perspective. You bet your life wasn't a particularly interesting game in and of itself, its really just trivia questions, but any Groucho fan will love it.",1358467200,,656,4.5508474576271185

As many others have noted in their reviews it is almost impossible to build a collection of YBYL DVDs without many,many duplicates, a real shame.  Using the secret word as a reference is not good as they often repeated the word in different shows.  The contestant names is good  but who can remember all those names?
What is needed is a Grouchophile that can catalog the episodes of YBYL in chronological order and number them.  Then collections could use the episode numbers for reference when listing content.  Unfortunately this would require access to the Library of Congress and UCLA collections of the films from the show and/or NBC archives.  If some company was ambitious enough to offer to do the job they could actually transfer copies of the over 400 shows and release them in volumes.

Commercials that allow us to see how everyday life was back then, push-button transmission, and powdered shampoo.

Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.

Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.

From the descriptions from other reviewers of this volume, this is obviously another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.

Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.

I'm glad I did.",1284940800,2,295,4.363636363636363
2630329,4,B000H7J9IU,"If you love Groucho and have all the Marx Bros movies and perhaps have read his autobiography, this is a good addition to your appreciaton of this great of comedy. These programs were massive US hits first on radio and then on t.v. Basically the quiz is just a premise for Groucho to adlib (or at least appear to!) as he interviews and gently sends up his guests and flirts with and leers at young women guests (hey it's Groucho and that was his shtick). Enjoyable but get the movies first!",1281139200,2,490,4.395604395604396
2630330,4,B000H7J9IU,"I'm going to post this information for the people - like myself - trying to collect as many episodes as possible with as few duplicates.

I obviously had to guess on some of the spellings.  As you can see a lot of the Secret Words are the same, making this very difficult to see what you already have in your collection.  I had three other discs before I got this one and one of them had all the same ones on this set so I was able to give that one away.  The two others had some duplicates but some not so I'm hanging on to those.  Hopefully this will help some of you until bigger collections start getting released.",1273795200,93,2165,4.687002652519894
2630331,4,B000H7J9IU,"I'd give 5 stars to the shows themselves.  Most of these are public domain and available on You Tube.  However, it's nice to have them on a disk, available at a fair price.  Navigation of episodes is difficult, no titles for the episodes - just numbers.  It can be difficult to keep track of where you are.
There is a 1 disk collection, 13 episodes, by Echo Bridge.  I'm fairly certain all those episodes are also on this 2 disk collection.",1272326400,4,440,4.382716049382716

2630334,4,B000H7J9IU,"One of the funniest game shows of the 1950's. I had only seen clips of episodes and was curious about what was so good about the Great Groucho doing a game show.  Well, his wit is on target, I can't tell if it's a set up or a real slice of off the cuff.  His contestents cover all aspects and backgrounds.  They are annoying and in some cases seem to be stero-types brought to life.  But then, that may have been their own expectation of how to act.

My favorite part aside from the hidden jokes would have to the ad's for the Desoto's.  Having never ridden in one it makes my heart flutter at what was obvious a great car.  Will a fan of classic Televison enjoy this? You Bet Your Life you will!",1256774400,7,696,4.111111111111111
2630335,5,B000H7J9IU,"This has to be the best collection of ""You Bet Your Life"" episodes ever put together! I have them all, but this one is best! The quality of the audio goes up and down, but Groucho is always killing you with laughter!!",1255305600,17,217,4.190476190476191
2630336,4,B000H7J9IU,"For anyone who hasn't seen or collected ""You Bet Your Life"", this is a great all-around package.  At 13 hours 40 minutes, it's a generous collection of thirty of Groucho's episodes.  Picture and sound quality are high, with all George Fenneman's segues intact; inclusion of Desoto and Prom commercials are a welcome charm.  For people who already have a YBYLife collection, there are some episodes not seen elsewhere, including Bettina Consola's gift of pizzas to Groucho, TV cowboy star Crash Corrigan, and rare Pet Milk commercials.
However, menus and navigation are pretty basic; fifteen episodes on each of two discs are numbered links, but unlike other packages, there are no extras, out-takes, dates, or ability to isolate commercials.  Don't look for printed booklets either; you might want to type your own list of episode descriptions.  But for the price, this is a delightful set to own.
