8587065,5,B00CX1OHLM,"Been waiting a while to see this movie. Don't let the title fool you it isn't just an all out Great White bash. The people in the film just simply did not know very much about the Great White. It is absolutely amazing to see how much things have changed, and how much knowledge we have gained since this movie was released. The dive practices are pretty infantile to say the least. You will be shocked at some of the things they do and risks they take if you are a diver.

Sidenote...there are some scenes near the beginning that show whale harpooning, and they way the talk about it may offend some folks. There is also a scene near the middle of the film that takes you into the whale processing plant...you have been warned.",1461024000,4,727,4.345588235294118
8587066,1,B00CX1OHLM,"Never before has such arrogance and disregard towards nature been captured on film. This graphic, archaic relic of a film should only now stand as a historical document on how our attitudes towards whales and sea life used to be. The people involved in this film were more interested in being considered ""adventurers"" and being ""the first"" at something than in the great white shark they were trying to capture on film. Watching their elation at whales being harpooned so sharks would be attracted to the carnage so they could get their footage is truly sickening. They chose to manufacture a feeding frenzy from harpooned and bleeding whales, then put themselves in danger by swimming outside their shark cages to get closer footage of oceanic white tip sharks, and then killed them if the sharks got too close. Talk about raping the seas - these idiots should be ashamed and embarrassed at this film instead of claiming that they brought any kind of positive public awareness to whales, sharks, or any other type of sea life. Even in the DVD commentary they really don't show any true remorse for the whales or sharks they killed for the sake of their movie.",1404518400,2,1160,4.776119402985074
