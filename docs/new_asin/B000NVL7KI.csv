8181692,4,B000NVL7KI,"This is the film that made Rudolf Valentino (1895-1926) into a super star. He was born in Italy and came to the US in 1913. Some critics consider this 1921 film his best film, others contend that it was his 1926 film, after which he died at age 31, that was Valentino at his best. Most critics agree that he was not a very good actor, he overacts in this film, but he had sex appeal; he was Hollywood's first sex symbol, the first Latin lover.
In this film, the Arab Sheik kidnaps a non-Arab English woman, and arguably, it is not clear in the film, rapes her during the several days that she is captivity. similarly, in The Son of the Sheik, about this Sheiks son, the son rapes a woman that he loved at time that he hated her because he thought she had arranged for him to be kidnaped.
 The first film, The Sheik, was a very popular film and propelled him to renown, so he followed it up with The Son of the Sheik where he played both the father from the prior film and his son.
The Sheik is about a young man who falls in love with an English woman whom he kidnaps without any feelings of love, only carnal interest. He feels that when an Arab sees a woman he wants, he takes her. She doesnt want to marry anyone, considering marriage, even among Europeans, captivity.
Interestingly, the film calls the Arab land a world of peace. The Arabs dwell in happy ignorance that civilization has passed them by. Women/wives are treated as slaves. The film makes it clear that although the Sheik leads a tribe of Arabs, he is the child of Europeans.

8181696,5,B000NVL7KI,The Sheik is a wonderful Hollywood soapopera from 1921. Rudolph Valentino is the whole show as a sheik who kidnaps a young woman in the desert. Fans of Valentino and lovers of classic fils will love this one.,1416787200,3,208,4.5
8181697,5,B000NVL7KI,"You kind of have to be a silent-movie geek or a hopeless romantic to love this movie.  Luckily I'm both.

This movie is based off of a book of the same title by E.M. Hull.  A defiant young British woman is trying to avoid marriage (or at least postpone it) because she sees it as the end of independence for women.  To do so, she decides to take a small ""vacation"" into the Arabian desert.  The night before she is to take off, she sneaks into an Arabs-only party, dressed as an arab woman, but is disovered by the ever-handsome and ever-flamboyant Rudolph Valentino, who plays the Sheik Ahmed ben Hussan.  He arranges to kidnap her on her trip and make her fall in love with him.  Adventure and romance ensues and fun is had by all...or most.

I particularly like this movie for several reasons:
1. RV is in it.
2. the flamboancy of the movie is just too much fun.  very few things are understated.
3. the protrayal of the characters is well done and comes across strongly in this silent movie.  Ever emotion is well portrayed, many times as subtly as could be done during the silent movie era.

Keep in mind; this movie was made at a time when racism was not only rampant but almost strongly encouranged and when inter-racial marriage was not allowed and highly frowned upon.  As such, adjustments were made to the movie's story and this movie has quite a few derogatory portrayals of Arabs in it.  This is kind of to be expected in a movie from this era, but it's still kind of a shock from todays standards.

This is one of the classics from that era.  In my opinion, it's a must-have for any silent movie fan's collection.",1322092800,2,1627,4.394648829431438
8181698,2,B000NVL7KI,"I LOVE Rudolph Valentino and adore all of his movies, but this version of ""The Sheik"" left me lukewarm.

Some years ago, when AMC still featured film classics and no commercials, they aired a black and white version of ""The Sheik"" that I was fortunate to have taped.  The film quality was sharp, crisp, and offered enough contrast so that details were easily apparent without my having to strain my eyes or compel me to sit a foot away from the TV set to notice them.  Enhancing this version, the musical score emphasized the exotic setting and romantic allure of the story.

As an added bonus, this version contained a scene that isn't featured in any recent releases: The morning following her abduction, Diana awakens to find rose petals strewn on her bed.  She is moved by the beauty of the petals until she notices Ahmed's cigarette holder on a nearby table.  She remembers a sensation of being touched while she slept and fears that Ahmed may have ravaged her during the night.  The servant girl, Zelia, assures Diana nothing improper has taken place.  She then proceeds to show Diana the basket from which she, Zelia, has taken the flower petals to spread on Diana's bed.  Zelia also explains (and we are shown through flashback) that Zelia, while sleeping on the ground next to Diana, had held Diana's hand through the night to comfort her.

I watched this magnificent version many, many times, until about a week ago, when quite unfortunately, and rather tragically for me, the video tape snapped in two while being rewound.  I was heartbroken!!

Although I already own the special edition DVD (""The Sheik"" and ""Son of The Sheik"") put out by Image Entertainment featuring the color tinted version of ""The Sheik"", I still longed for a black and white version. Imagine my delight when I saw an opportunity to own a black and white version of ""The Sheik"", hopefully comparable to my lost copy.  I was thrilled!

The feeling, however, didn't last very long.  This DVD (reproduced and distributed by Reel Enterprises in 2006) offers no special features, no menu and no scene selection feature.  From the moment you put the disc into your DVD player, the movie starts to play.  This in itself wouldn't be so bad.

Fifteen minutes into watching this version, however, is when major disappointment set in.  Although this version offers the original title cards, the film quality isn't sharp or crisp, and at times is even a bit dulled.  Although watchable, it's evident that cost measures, not film qualtiy, took top priority for the folks at Reel Enterprises. This version is nothing but a direct transfer of an average quality video to DVD. Too bad that all the technological advances made in film restoration and DVD production were ignored by Reel Enterprises.  With a little extra expense, they could have produced a quality product.

BTW, that extra scene was missing in this version, another disappointment for me.

By far my biggest complaint with this version is the music.  A musical score should enhance the mood of the entire film or contribute to the intensity of a particular scene.  This DVD's musical score evokes none of the smoldering passion, romance or emotions of the characters, nor does it contribute to the film's exotic atmosphere.  It's little more than non-descript generic background music, basically elevator music, undermining every scene in this film. The music throughout this version consists of a solo piano movement or violin piece  playing gently and rather drowsily in the background during passionate love scenes as well as battle sequences. Even the ""Kashmiri Song"" which Valentino's character sings (via title cards) is overlooked. There isn't a single musical allusion to this love song; not even a few musical notes from this piece are reproduced anywhere in the film.  Later, when the action shifts to the desert where an impassioned Ahmed abducts Diana, a soothing violin/piano movement is heard.  Contrast this same scene with  the color tinted version from Image Entertainment which highlights the action by using ""Bacchanale"" from ""Samson et Dalila"" by Saint-Saens.

As with the film quality, so it must have been with the musical quality: cost measures were clearly top priority for Reel Enterprises.  How else do you explain the choice of a generic musical score that acts as a lullaby for an audience, rather than arouses viewers to watch a virile, passionate, smouldering, intense Valentino fight for the woman he loves.

Bottom line:  Don't waste your money or time on this inferior transfer.  Instead, invest your money in a quality DVD  of ""The Sheik"".",1253836800,16,4607,4.953125
