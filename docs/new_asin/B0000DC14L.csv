8222735,3,B0000DC14L,"Jack Palance plays Manzari the crime boss who owns Rome,Italy. This was extremely low-budget! if you liked The Death Collector, Buy it!",1390003200,,135,5.181818181818182
8222736,2,B0000DC14L,"This appears to be a bad knock-off of a gangster film. In the opening scene we see Scarface (Jack Palance) get his scar. He shoots a man several times, as the man waves his arms, going into a comic death scene, he throws a glass ashtray (?) at the robber and nicks him in the face. This robber goes on to become a tough crime boss who smoke cigarettes with a long cigarette holder.

Tony (Harry Baer) is a strong arm collection man with a rich cousin in Brazil. He meets another collector, one who works for Scarface and has less acting credentials. They devise a plan to scam some money and go to Brazil.

The dubbing was bad. The transfer was bad. Acting and plot were bad. Fat men in muscle tees.

Parental Guide: F-bomb (I think- bad sound too) brief nudity.",1362096000,,762,4.314685314685315
8222737,5,B0000DC14L,"The RARO edition of this film is called ""rulers of the city"" and has a superb transfer. A very fun film by Fernando Di Leo. Buy the box set that includes this film, along with the Milano Trilogy.",1360368000,,195,4.157894736842105
8222738,2,B0000DC14L,"Mister Scarface, 1976 film

A door opens, two men walk into a dark room. One man shoots another. More shots. A young boy sees this. The credits roll - this is a foreign film. A young man goes to collect money frm a customer. [The voices are dubbed.] Tony is a debt collector. ""Luigi sent me."" Other men follow him. At a club a man deals a card from the bottom and is caught. Then Mr. Scarface shows up with friend to play. His team has a rule (no suckers). Tony continue to collect debts. He returns to find a fight. He offers to collect a check from Scarface. Rick has an idea. Two men from Government Finance show up to inspect Manzari's office books. Can they be paid off? Will there be trouble? [A view of foreign business practices.] Napoli advises Luigi to leave town for a while.

A young woman dances at a bar. Tony considers a new job. A gang of men are looking for Luigi. There is a fight. ""Fork over the dough!"" Men with guns look for Tony. One man doesn't like the actor in a show. Luigi has a problem with a subordinate. Scarface takes over. Tony suspects Peppy has sold out. Napoli goes to his First Aid cabinet, then to the pool hall. Scarface sends men to look for Tony. They have an accident. Napoli makes a telephone call. ""I wonder who is behind all this?"" ""You know what I mean?"" Rick repays Peppy for Luigi. They look for a safe hide-out. Tony gives a list to Scarface. Will he take it? Scarface shows up with three cars and twelve men. What are the odds? They meet at a deserted slaughter-house. Soon shots are fired.

Rick recalls past history before he shoots his pistol. More shots, more bodies fall. [This is like a cartoon.] A car drives around inside a walled building. [This pads out the film.] There are chases and shooting to continue the story. ""That was the last of them."" The three men meet at the end and decide to travel to Brazil. Will their troubles be over?

The value to this film is to watch a crime story from a German-Italian production company about crime in an Italian city. You won't see this on your local TV channel. Does it remind you of some Hollywood movies? Its like a cartoon in parts. How plausible is the story? I guess Tony is a star in Italy, Rick in Germany, and you know about Jack Palance.",1340841600,,2249,4.297169811320755
8222739,1,B0000DC14L,This version of the movie was recorded onto DVD from a very worn-out VHS tape. There were several places where the person pushed buttons inadvertently or adjusted tracking.  The cover shows a female who is not present in the film itself. It's really very silly.,1320537600,,261,4.8
8222740,1,B0000DC14L,"- The picture is faded.

- The acting is stiff and childish.

- The plot is ridiculous.

- Jack Palance is good in other movies made in the 90's not this which was made in the 70's.

- It's a huge waste of my money.

- I will never buy action films made in the 70's again.",1302998400,,272,3.7017543859649122

8222742,1,B0000DC14L,"A gangster is killed by a rival mobster [Jack Palance]. Years later, His son goes looking for the man that killed his father. This movie was no good. Acting is bad, The action is boring, The fight scenes are very bad, And the story is just too predictable. This italian gangster movie doesn't even deserve to have a talented actor like Jack Palance as its star. This movie isn't worth owning, Even if it is now a bargain title. Hope the review helped. I'm out",1135641600,,459,4.411764705882353
8222743,3,B0000DC14L,"Its not perfect, the picture isn't dvd quality because of the age of the movie I guess, its weird there not being more music in the background, but I thought it was ok. I thought there was a plot unlike another review said, its not worth paying a lot for, but if you can find a cheap copy like I did it might be worth looking into, I only paid a dollar for mine so if you cant find it too cheap don't buy it expecting a modern day special effect, musical score, and acting status movie, remember it was made in 1976 when thinking about getting it.",1125360000,,547,4.074074074074074
