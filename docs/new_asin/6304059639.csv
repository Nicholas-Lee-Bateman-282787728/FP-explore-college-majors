793224,5,6304059639,"The second of the Gunsmoke movies. James Arness is in solid form as retired Marshall Matt Dillon .Amanda Blake passed away after the first reunion movie,so the writers made this one a sequel to the Gunsmoke episode ""Matts Love Story "" and brought back his one night stand lady and introduced their daughter Beth. LOVED how well this one is written and acted. RIP James Arness, you made Gunsmoke real .",1440633600,3,401,4.661971830985915

793377,5,6304059639,"The disc arrived on time in perfect condition. The show is Gunsmoke at its best, lots of action, riding horses in dry country, maidens in peril, everything but someone tied to railroad tracks. Good Western-style entertainment.",1394323200,,226,5.305555555555555
793378,5,6304059639,"Once again having all of the Gunsmoke movies has been great. I have never seen any of them and it was nice to see Matt Dillon have a life, love and family after being a Marshal for twenty years. The only regret was that he and Ms. Kitty never got together. Thank you.",1380153600,,267,4.056603773584905
793379,5,6304059639,"The sound  and picture  quality were fine in  this 2nd. feature with James Arness as Matt Dillon. Bring in  the Indians, as many regular Gunsmoke shows included..and you have another  great show.  Fans of this  series  of  635 regular  episodes  running 20 years on TV from 1955 to  1975  will also  like  this  feature-western  they made . I did.",1362268800,,347,4.610169491525424

793381,3,6304059639,"I'm 21 years old and love Gunsmoke. I have ever since I was six  years old and started watching the reruns. Now I remember seeing this movie on TV when it first aired in 1990 but I hadn't really remembered it so I bought it on DVD plus I had the other two movies so I thought I would finish the collection and get this one. Now I don't hate this movie nor do I really care for it. I love Matt Dillon in this movie, he is still the same way he was back in the shows: tough and wants nothing but justice and is still fast with a gun. I guess being the fan that I am of the TV show, it's hard to see Matt Dillon having a daughter or any kid for that matter.

When it came to non stop action, this movie was great and it did keep you interested in what was going to happen next.

Despite the fact that I said this isn't the best movie, it's not the worst movie either. However I still think that the first movie: Return to Dodge is the best Gunsmoke movie in the 3 Gunsmoke movie collection.",1243468800,,987,3.900497512437811
793382,3,6304059639,"I got this movie in VHS, long before it was offered online and it was tough to find in the video store. When I first saw it I had no clue about Matt Dillon's history with Michael Yardner until one day I saw the original Gunsmoke episode. I confess, I got this movie because of Joe Lara who plays Mandac, whom I didn't know of when I first saw this movie on television. It wasn't until Mr. Lara played in Tarzan: The Epic Adventures that I began to collect his movies, this being one of them--and I might add, in my collection only this movie and another of his are worth watching. When I was a fan I learned that mixed with some other things, Mr. Lara has--ta daaa--Apache in him though from which side, he never revealed. Joe played Mandac  well as the brooding, slightly surly, yet gentle sort. Dillon's daughter, the nasty Beth, was an idiot who didn't realize how lucky she was to be in Mandac's clutches who treated her a lot better than any  man would've. Sadly, the movie didn't focus enough on Mandac and Beth whose characters should've been more developed as we already know who Dillon was, who really cared about her mother, or about scout, Chalk Brighton, who exhibited stupid jelousy for Dillon.  Throughout the whole movie Mandac is made the bad guy, not even a tragic hero. Then he gets shot in the end because he was an Indian! Beth's mother wouldn't have shot him had he been a white man who kidnapped her daughter and then decided to come back for a last visit. Mandac rides off and would Dillon leave it alone despite Beth telling him Mandac didn't hurt her? Noooooo! Dillon had to track him down. Why? Because the writer decided to make Mandac the eternal bad guy who didn't even deserve the dignity of going off to die without being bothered. Without Joe Lara, this movie wouldn't have been worth watching because an aged James Arness isn't a pretty sight.",1174867200,4,1876,4.47953216374269
793383,4,6304059639,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie except for two things. Now that Matt is done with the law why didn't he go after Kitty and marry her or something. The other being the length of Matt's hair, they finally cut it in the other movies. We see that Matt hasn't changed much except his clothing and residence, his values are still the same and he's as tough and resourceful as ever.",1150761600,6,375,4.371428571428571
7862913,5,6304059639,"This is the first of the final saga of Gunsmoke movies that were made after Gunsmoke's 25 year run on TV. If you haven't seen is is worth it to buy. It tells the story Matt Dillon's daughter. I tried to find this movie streaming and nowhere had it. Being a PRIME member It was not available for streaming either.  I contacted customer service about this and because it was only available on DVD when the others were. Very good movie.

To my surprise I was gifted the DVD by Amazon free of charge. That is just one of the wonderful benefits of Amazon Prime.",1526083200,,556,4.285714285714286
