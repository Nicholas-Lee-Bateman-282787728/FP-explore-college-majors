I know playing games with your dog doesn't sound like rocket science, but this series really goes into how to work with your dog's natural instincts, rather than trying to stop them. i.e., if your dog is naturally a chewer or a chaser (due to breed or just personality), there are games to give them outlets for those instincts, so they don't end up chewing your shoes or chasing your cat. I really learned a lot about why my dog acts the way she does, what her natural instincts are, and how to give her what she needs... plus it's just plain fun to play with your dog! 4 paws up!",1327881600,,602,4.243478260869566
