8374289,3,B002MYYL3Y,"PROS:

* It's Jeanette Jenkins! (This is my 3rd workout I have purchased from her)
* Diverse workout
* Challenging

CONS:

* There is zero transition between the high-impact kickboxing and yoga. You go from very intense, to suddenly stopping and doing a tree pose. Not good.

* NOT a beginner workout. Very advanced.",1505088000,3,316,4.796296296296297

8374292,5,B002MYYL3Y,"ANY dvd by Ms. Jenkins, I enjoy! I get such a GREAT workout. She's up there with Shaun, Tony, Cathe and Jillian. I
have a lot of exercise dvds....but you get a good workout with these guys. P.S: I also LOVE ""The ""Slim in Six ""dvds.
I find Ms. Jenkins' dvds so EXPENSIVE, but worth it!",1393459200,2,284,4.089285714285714
