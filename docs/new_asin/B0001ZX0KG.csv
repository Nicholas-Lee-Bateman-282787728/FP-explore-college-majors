8019246,4,B0001ZX0KG,"Three great B/W (funny) horror movies. Topper Returns is the best of the three. The three stars who make this so good are Roland Young, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, and Joan Blondell. Spooks Run Wild staring the Bowery Boys is a good one, but it is Bela Lugosi and Dennis Moore who make this one great. While King of the Zombies is good it is not the Bowery Boys that are the top stars. Dick Purcell and Mantan Moreland are the top stars in this one. The add for these movies will give you good information, just enough to get your interest and not give away the movies. If you love these old 30s and 40s B/W horror movies you will like all three of these. The pictures and sound are good on all three. You'll have fun watching each one.",1448668800,,736,4.264285714285714
