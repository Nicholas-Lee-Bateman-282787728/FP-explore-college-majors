7570325,5,B019D3J3N4,"How many times have we been told that a film is ""important"" or a ""must see"" or ""life changing"" or any other word or phrase designed to compel us to watch it?  Most of the time it is just hype, often fuelled by a director's sense of self-importance.  Thankfully that is not the case with A DOG NAMED GUCCI.  This time, it's the truth.  Important?  Yes.  Must see?  Yes.  Life changing?  Yes.  Self-important?  No.  SUBJECT-important?  Absolutely.

Even so, it would be easy for a subject-important film to be derailed by its maker's sense of self-importance.

It would also be relatively easy to make a film about animal abuse that forcefully appeals to peoples' sense of decency and compassion.  It wouldn't take much to shock the viewer to the point of numbness.  Wisely, filmmaker Gorman Bechard takes a different approach.  Instead of making us feel outraged or guilty or anything that even suggests manipulation, he presents his story with the purity of the master documentarian, by presenting the facts unadorned as they are, without commentary (from him) and letting his audience respond to them.

Of course there are moments in A DOG NAMED GUCCI when you will cry, especially if you are a dog lover.  You are bound to feel outrage at other times.  But not because the director wants you to feel that way.  When a filmmaker starts telling you what to think and feel about something that becomes propaganda.  At times, this is appropriate.  Most of the time, it is the easy way out.  The ""voice of God"" director--think Michael Moore--dictates.  I prefer the director who relates, assumes the intelligence of the audience and then has the strength of his/her convictions that the material they are presenting for consideration is sufficient to make their point.

In a fallen world, animal abuse remains a constant.  As a subject for a documentary film it is horribly relevant.  Critics may yell ""animal abuse? what about the abuse of children? the elderly? war? etc.""  But that simply misses the point.  The subject of animal abuse will be as meaningful to you as much as your sense of justice, compassion and indignation is engaged.  Presented in the way A DOG NAMED GUCCI is presented, the widest possible audience is likely to respond in the way that best serves the subject matter: by being inspired to stand up, speak up and make a difference.

Once upon a time an adorable little puppy was ripped from the arms of its young runaway owner, hung by a rope around its neck over a tree branch, slapped and punched, then set on fire.  An innocent animal that should have died was instead rescued and nurtured back to life by the love and care of a number of individuals, including his new ""dad"", Doug James.  After recovery, the mission to see the little dog's (now named Gucci) tormentors apprehended and punished was under way.

And therein lies the true substance and value of this film.  Woefully inadequate U.S. laws that made it difficult to prosecute let alone alone punish Gucci's perpetrators were gradually challenged and changed through the efforts of Doug James and many, many others.  And always, like the truest guide to justice, was the presence of Gucci in the courtroom a considerable factor in appealing to lawmakers' compassion and sense of responsibility.  And with Doug James and Gucci leading the way, others, in other circumstances, stood up and were counted as well.  A DOG NAMED GUCCI takes a handful of these heart-rending stories and weaves them into the tapestry of the film's fabric.  By the end, though we have cried, felt outrage and mourned the loss of so many of God's precious creatures to human cruelty, we are left with an appreciation for those who have facilitated change in the law toward animal abusers.  Equally important, we are inspired to have zero tolerance for these criminals if and when we encounter such behaviour in our own experience and in our own country.

And that is why A DOG NAMED GUCCI is one of the most important films you will ever see.",1461369600,12,4002,4.7894736842105265
7570326,5,B019D3J3N4,A dog named Gucci is a warm film that tells the tale of a special dog and the man who worked to save his life after he was set on fire.

A Dog Named Gucci grew out of our love for our own rescue dogs.  It is an inspiring story that will make you believe you can really make a difference.  I promise you there are NO turn-away moments.  You will not be bombarded by photos and videos of abused animals.  Instead you will fall in love with Gucci, as I did in making the film.  You will laugh, you will learn.  The story will make you hug your dog.  And help you realize we are the voice for animals.

There are three other stories also featured in the film: Susie from North Carolina, Nitro from Ohio, and Louis Vuitton from Alabama (whose abuser was the first test of the Gucci law...he got 10 years!).

Our DVD has almost 2 hours of EXTRAS, including: Gucci Memorabilia, the Q&A from the Sidewalk Film Festival, information on how you can make a difference, a look at the story of the Long Island dog Queenie, and a candid conversation with me about dogs, filmmaking, and why after three successful rock & roll documentaries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Replacements-Color-Me-Obsessed-A-Film-About-The-Replacements/dp/B0091JJ24Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements</a>&nbsp;I made this film.

7570330,5,B019D3J3N4,Liked this film as it shows the development of anti cruelty laws in this country. Don't know if it is exhaustive (probably not) but it sure raises awareness of not only the cruelty issue but how activists have brought laws to bear throughout the U.S. Everybody should watch because everybody needs to be aware. Persons who can be cruel to an animal can be cruel to humans as been often shown. These people need help. Society needs to be aware and help to stop these abuses.,1469836800,4,473,4.511627906976744
7570331,5,B019D3J3N4,"This video is a landmark piece of work opening the door to the world of animal abuse.  Gucci and his wonderful savior made it possible to change laws and change the viewpoint of society about animal abuse.  It's a long road, but Gucci, his savior Doug James and movie director Gorman Bechard.  If you love animals, you will LOVE ""A Dog Named Gucci!""",1466985600,3,349,4.507936507936508
7570332,5,B019D3J3N4,"A Dog Named Gucci is a heartwarmingly sad tale of a dog who survives the unimaginable with the help of a kind human. It brings to spotlight the horrors of animal abuse. Gucci is the star of the show, but the documentary also covers the plight of several other dogs, some not as lucky to survive as Gucci did. One such story is of Nitro, the Rottweiler in Ohio who was starved to death by his ""trainer"". Bring your tissues, but also bring your awareness.",1465948800,4,453,4.341176470588235

7570335,5,B019D3J3N4,"I was moved by this sensitive but honest documentary. The main character in the film, Gucci, is an inspiration, as much as is his savior, Doug James. Director Gorman Bechard has an eye for the emotional lay of the land in this story but is never maudlin or melodramatic. He hits the right notes in presenting what is, initially, a horrific but an ultimately inspiring tale. And it doesn't hurt that the dog at the center of this story has in indefatigable smile on his face. Never wonder if one person, or dog, can change the world!",1462665600,7,532,4.494845360824742
7570336,5,B019D3J3N4,"If you are familiar with the work of Writer and Director Gorman Bechard, it may be from his early dark comedies like Psychos in Love and Friends (with Benefits).  Or perhaps the moody You Are Alone (which was based in part on his novel Ninth Square).  More recently Bechard has made a name for himself in music-focused documentaries, notably Color Me Obsessed: A Film About the Replacements and the upcoming Who is Lydia Loveless?

With that kind of track record, A Dog Named Gucci may seem to be quite a departure.  But it only takes a few minutes of the film to realize this is a subject he understands and cares deeply about.  And it takes a special craftsman to tackle the topic of animal cruelty, and more specifically the struggle to enact tougher laws against it, without simply going the easy route of tear-jerking horrors and melodramatic soundtrack music.

Im not trying to say you won't cry when you watch this film.  If you have any kind of heart, you will.  But you will also be inspired to stand up and be counted, to speak out for those who have no voice.  And you will have a much better understanding of just how difficult it was to get many of todays laws in place, and just as importantly youll see that laws serve no purpose when time and again prosecutors choose not to pursue cases, or judges let the guilty off with a slap on the wrist becausewell, because, after all, its just a dog.

Most of the film tells the story of Gucci, who became the face of animal cruelty in 1990s Alabama (and beyond).  As a ten-week old puppy, Gucci was owned by a 15-year old runaway.  As punishment for refusing to date a local teenager, a group of males took Gucci from this girl, hung him by his neck, doused him with lighter fluid, and set him on fire.  Doug James, an Adjunct Professor who was in the process of selling his home up the street, had been standing on his porch awaiting a prospective buyer.  Hearing the dogs cries, he and another neighbor rescued Gucci  still aflame  from under a house, doused him with water to extinguish the fire, and returned him to the girl.  But she knew there was nobody she could turn to who could help this poor suffering creature, so she begged Doug to take him and help him, which he did.  Gucci was eerily quiet all night, and Doug didn't expect him to survive to the next morning.  But Gucci was a fighter, and he did survive.

With this nightmare begins a 15-year fight to change the laws against animal abuse in Alabama.  The prosecutor found he had to charge the thugs with destruction of property (pets being considered nothing more at the time) because the laws were written in such a way that setting fire to a couch carried a heavier punishment than strictly being charged with animal cruelty.  Building a large following through the state and the south, Gucci became the face of the movement to change those laws and make animal cruelty a felony in Alabama.

Bechards direction style puts all the horrors Gucci and the other dogs he features suffered through right on the table, but is careful to keep the story moving in a forward direction.  Instead of 90 minutes of happy endings, focus is constantly redirected at how difficult it is to get laws to change.  The Gucci Bill as it became known took 16 years before it was finally passed and signed.  Along the way exclusions had to be inserted about the right of a landowner to shoot a dog with a BB gun if it is going to the bathroom on his property.  The details of how the debates are shaped, and how asinine some of the arguments against it become, will motivate and energize you to be more involved in strengthening the laws of your own state.  Other cases are looked at that were used as rallying cries to change laws in North Carolina and Ohio; South Dakota became the 50th  and last  state to make animal cruelty a felony only a few years ago.

And, of course, the fight doesnt stop there.  Bechard never hits the audience over the head with anything, never browbeats.  He just spells out the facts, and displays the human emotion and the faces of those who have suffered.  Animal abuse is a major problem in this country; it isn't just kids throwing rocks at stray dogs.  Public pressure is the only way to make sure cases are actually prosecuted, and that punishments are handed down by the judges in a serious fashion.  One poor dog who gets just a moment on the screen had been blown up by explosives; the guy who did that to him received 10 continuances on his case and eventually just had to receive psychiatric treatment.  The interviews with prosecutors and animal control officers are bright lights focused on what people need to do if this problem will be treated more seriously.  The public must keep the pressure on local and state politicians, and need to show support for prosecutors when they are trying cases against animal abusers.  As one woman says, in a courtroom there is often a group of people sitting behind the defendantbut for the victim, nobody.  And these victims cannot speak for themselves.

The credits include the song One Voice  featuring stars like Niko Case, Lydia Loveless, Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, and Queens Brian May - which can be purchased through ITunes (the proceeds from the song go entirely to support the cause of animal rights and the fight against animal abuse).  And, if you could do me a personal favor, watch the film all the way to the end of the credits, until the screen goes dark.

A Dog Named Gucci is available on DVD from Amazon and can be viewed on demand from multiple sources.  There have also been local screenings, sponsored by various animal organizations and rescue groups, so keep your eye out for one of those.  I urge you to watch this film, and then tell five other people about it.  Buy the DVD as a gift for others if necessaryI did.  Spread the word.  One person, one voice, CAN make a difference.  Doug James proved that, and so did Gucci.",1462233600,5,5949,4.519176800748363

8744709,5,B019D3J3N4,"A wonderful documentary showing how dedicated people can get laws enacted and/or changed to protect the voiceless.  Being a long time volunteer at our county shelter and involved with rescue for over 15 years, the laws are horribly lacking when it comes to protecting animals.  We as a country are on a slow (too slow in my eyes) road in the right direction.  I have fostered several dogs that were victims of cruelty and the dogs are definitely the better beings.  They just love unconditionally and forgive humans for what was done to them.

I usually cannot watch animal films but this was so well done that I found my interest in how the heroes went about fighting for Gucci and Susie within the court system enough to override the anger towards the perpetrators.  We have to get involved and change our society to protect not just the voiceless animals but the children, elderly, the ones that cannot protect themselves.  Too many times one hears first an animal then a person are victims of the sociopaths that commit crimes like this.  Thank you for a wonderfully done film that is getting the word out.",1529625600,2,1110,4.685567010309279

Anger, disgust, frustration at how cruel and ignorant some people can be, saddened, and ultimately made aware that it was only in 2014 that finally all 50 States have more important animal cruelty legislation on their books.  It was shocking - and sickening - when after the 4 major stories were covered, the additional short bios were shown (perhaps a dozen or more) and you see just how much more work still needs to be done.
