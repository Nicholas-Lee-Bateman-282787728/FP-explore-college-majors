They also wrote Inside the Goldmine together which is clearly the case. The way they craft a script can truly entrance the audience. It is this collaboration that was one of the key fundamental aspects that made Glam triumph. The story of ITGM is about two friends named Jordan and Clyde, played by Alan Marshall and Josh Evans respectively. Their lives become changed forever by the murder of a young woman in their neighborhood. The story is quite thought provoking. The best scenes are a conversation between Jordan and Clyde about one believing in nothing and one believing in something, a scene with a script pitch to get Danny Devito to star in a movie, and Jordan's two conversations with his father, portrayed by Gary Chazen. Those two scenes are definitely my favorites. Jordan's father cares about his son but won't listen to him. Great movie!",1515715200,,1024,4.790960451977401

8021731,1,B000244EOM,"Amazon should return the entire stock of these to the devious outfit that released the DVD. The cover and art show large pictures of Drew Barrymore and Natasha Wagner - and them only. Further, they get first and second billing as the top stars. Guess what?  Each has a fifteen second cameo appearance - that and not a tad more. If this is not fraud I don't know what is!  Amazon - send these back! As to the movie itself, its dreary, dull and annoying beyond even the most far reaching of indy film and art standards.",1098316800,11,517,4.319587628865979
