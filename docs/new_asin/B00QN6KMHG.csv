8692162,5,B00QN6KMHG,"Fans of the Bond movies may like to check out this little-known 1986 entry about a stuntcar-racing duo led by Judd Pearson (Cliff Robertson) and his offsider Casey (Leif Garrett) who are given the job by scientist Christine Ruben (Lisa Harrow) to smuggle an Andromeda-Strain-type virus from under the noses of the New Zealand military and into the hands of the CIA. The ensuing car-chases and constant escapes from a Bond-type-villain played beautifully by ""Always The Bad Guy"" Shane Briant are really good edge-of-the-seat fun with a climax not dissimilar in appearance to the final scenes in Steven Spielberg's furst movie ""Duel"". The car chase up on the mountainside roads after one of Shane Briant's henchmen smashes a brand new car thru the glass frontage of a car showroom in Wellington is particularly memorable. Taken entirely on location in New Zealand, I recognized the Blenheim Bridge from when I was in NZ in 1980. MadMax fans may relate the massive explosion at a container terminal which is reminiscent of the huge blast at the end of ""Mad Max 2"". Everything seen in this movie is realtime i.e. no CGI which is how I like my movies to be. A bonus for me also in the movie is lovely Leif Garrett, a singer I have loved and adored for most of my life. Definitely a 5-star movie from me!",1475884800,,1298,4.697368421052632
