7873568,5,6304475969,"Included in this fascinating (but dated) video is the remarkable newsfilm which changed much of the world's thinking about gorillas twenty years ago.  A young boy falls into a gorilla pit at the London Zoo, where he lies unconscious as a 450-lb. silverback gorilla slowly approaches him.  As stunned onlookers look on, the gorilla sits down beside him, and gently touches him with his finger, and when the child starts to cry, the gorilla returns to his enclosure.  Widely distributed on news channels, the film shows a gentle creature concerned about an injured child, not a King Kong.

Striking in its emphasis on the human qualities of these immense primates, this National Geographic special stresses their sociability, their fear of separation, their depression when kept in unnatural isolation, and, most of all, their gentleness.  It focuses particularly on ""urban gorillas,"" those animals removed from their natural habitats and living under the care of humans, illustrating the kinds of lives they lead--in gorilla orphanages, zoos, and, unfortunately, even a Tacoma, Washington, shopping mall.

Zoos in the past had little idea of the environment gorillas needed to lead a ""natural"" life, but times have changed.  The gorilla is now so threatened in its native environment that it is facing extinction, and the development of captive breeding programs and the creation of zoo environments closer to the animals' lives in the wild have become essential.  As we see here, gorillas at the San Diego Zoo once lived in a concrete cubbyhole, but the zoo demolished this exhibit in 1989, completely changing the gorilla habitat by making it open, with trees and hills.  A baby gorilla has been the result.  The Atlanta Zoo began a new exhibit in 1985, in which the gorillas range freely through grass and trees, and in 1988, their four gorilla family groups produced three new three babies.  John Aspinall's sanctuary for gorillas in Howletts, England, has produced 41 births since its inception.

By stressing what gorillas and humans have in common in this dramatic video, which is filled with moving ""portraits"" of individual gorillas, National Geographic succeeds in creating an ""understanding of our fellow primates.""  As narrator Glenn Close states, ""We will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.""
