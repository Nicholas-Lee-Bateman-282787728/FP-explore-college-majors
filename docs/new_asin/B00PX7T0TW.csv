8689662,2,B00PX7T0TW,I found the film to be entertaining but not really anything special as far as the story line goes. There were not a lot of scenes with Grant or Scott the story was mostly told through Nancy Carrol's character. Overall it was not A bad picture but not one of my favorites.,1526774400,,271,4.230769230769231

8689664,5,B00PX7T0TW,"Lots of nosy old ladies and friends gossiping about the young people, who heat it up on Saturday night. Ruths reputation is ruined by mean-spirited people. Good PreCode dating-focused movie. Great plot with interesting conflicts and good acting. Very early Cary Grant. A good look at relationships and mores in the early 30s. Very entertaining.",1481068800,4,344,5.2727272727272725

8689666,5,B00PX7T0TW,Why not give it five stars? the quality is great. It is my opinion that this is the first movie Archie Leach became Cary Grant...and of course there is Randolph Scott...but beneath all this is a movie about how to treat a woman...,1443312000,7,230,4.372093023255814
8689667,5,B00PX7T0TW,"I don't think I had watched a movie with Nancy Carroll before but Cary Grant, quite truthfully was the main attraction for me. I am a great fan of Mr. Grant and I think he was a wonderful actor. Miss Carroll was as cute as could be and I really liked her in her role, too. The movie was very good. I enjoyed it. I loved the time frame and the costuming. The cars were especially interesting. These old movies have so much to offer to people. I have become very interested in watching old movies and this one, Hot Saturday was a treat for me. I loved the happy ending, too. It is nice to find a movie that just makes you happy and feel good after you have seen it. I do recommend this movie.",1432684800,13,690,4.043795620437956
