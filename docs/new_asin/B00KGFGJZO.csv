8658333,5,B00KGFGJZO,"review by  a participant- david eberhardt- ""Baltimore 4""

In 2013, Joe Tropea finally got his movie- ""Hit and Stay"" about the anti draft and Plowshares
actions together.  The Y-12 Transform Plowshares  3 had broken into a nuclear storage facility in Tennessee; Code Pink was disrupting hearings in DC on the issue of drones. The were speaking truth to power with wonderful guerilla theatre- just as had we!  My friend Max Obuszewski - with anti war protests-  was filling Phil Berrigan's shoes admirably in Baltimore,

""Hit and Stay"" premiered on 3/9/2013 at the Chicago Underground  Film Festival- where it won
the ""Audience Favorite"" award. 100 people in attendance and well received.

It also screened at the Maryland Film Festival. May 17, (2013) is the 45th-year anniversary of the action that kicks
off the film: the burning of draft files by the Catonsville 9.

""Hit and Stay"" played in Baltimore to sell out crowds of approximately 400 in both venues,  and at both showings the movie was followed by a question and answer period featuring not  just the two film makers- but also persons who were in the movie.

Six years in the making, the 97-minute documentary is about anti draft board actions to protest
the Vietnam War. Beginning with the Baltimore Four, the movie progresses through the
Catonsville Nine and Milwaukee 14 to many other actions. There were 300 or so in all -
including the Harrisburg 8,  Camden 28, Flower City Conspiracy, Hoover Vacuum Conspiracy
and Women Against Daddy  Warbucks.

The movie describes how these actions evolved tactically from the ""Baltimore 4"" (where four people poured
blood on draft files and waited to be arrested, hence the phrase, ""hit and stay"") to the perhaps
 best known action, the Catonsville 9 (where draft files were burned with napalm) to actions like
Women Against Daddy Warbucks (where files were cut into confetti and many other actions.

I was in an earlier action, known as the Baltimore 4. In 1967, we poured blood on Selective
Service files at the Baltimore Custom House to protest the Vietnam War (for which I spent 21
months in federal prison). It's covered in the movie.

We weren't the first to attempt such a thing. In Minnesota, Barry Bondhus and his family
dumped s*** on draft records and, since they didn't try for media coverage, aren't so well-known.
Anyway, I was happy to see that ""Hit & Stay"" played to sell-out crowds of approximately 400 in
each of its two Baltimore screenings. At both showings, the movie was followed by a question-
and-answer period featuring not just the two film makers, but persons who were in the movie as
well.

As the actions progressed, they be came more and more secular and youthful. Jerry Elmer,
who is Jewish, states that Phil Berrigan was suspicious of him at first because of his age.

The film creates a gripping narrative arc, thanks to Joe and Skyzz even though it consists
largely of talking heads and interviews. Interspersed is commentary by such luminaries as
historian Howard Zinn and scholar Noam Chomsky. Some of the participants seem to
provide glue to hold the the narrative together more than others, such as Brendan Walsh, Liz
McCallister, Jim Forest, George Mische, Dan Berrigan and Dean Pappas, providing
key commentary and segues.

Music and animation in the film is effective, and shots of nature and Baltimore provide
welcome breaks to the intensity. Fine, moving, tear inducing drama is achieved!

The ""other side"" of the picture- that is, those opposed to these actions, is well represented by a
prosecutor - Steve Sachs- a Judge, retired FBI members, draft clerks and church goers.

Dan Berrigan spent considerable time in the ""underground"" deciding not to turn himself in
when it was time to report for prison as ordered, along  with George Mische, Mary Moylan,
David Eberhardt and Phil Berrigan . Dan gave the FBI fits as he popped up here and there to
give interviews or sermons. As he leaves after giving the morning sermon at one church,  a
member of the congregation comments- ""Oh that's what it's about? He's supposed to be in
jail with his bother?"" And another says- ""Well, he's entitled to his beliefs but I don't share
them""; another states- ""I think destroying draft cards is un-American"".

Given Joe and Skizz's youth, I fully expected an amateurish work and was pleasantly
surprised by the over all professionalism- thus leading to hopes of some wide distribution or
play on PBS or another more established venues (the hard part).

All of us participants learned a great deal about the other actions previously known only in
fragmentary fashion. To have big appreciative audiences as well as friends present to watch the
film was very moving.

In some, the activists would not wait to be arrested but disappeared, to surface at a later time.
There were also actions where people ""hit"" and then ran, avoiding capture altogether and others
where people acted and then 300 people claimed responsibility, making it impossible for the FBI
to arrest any one. or actions where people hit and then ran, avoiding capture altogether, or
actions

Participants appear speaking frankly and often humorously about their roles and plots and
schemes. Ms Daugherty, of a Boston action, speaks of spending the night watching the WRONG
building.  Tom Melville describes seminary and the priesthood as perfect training grounds for
prison. Weatherperson Bill Ayers says he finds religion rather a ""bummer,"" but praises the many
clergy involved in the draft actions. Jim Forest muses over the drill sergeant side of Phil Berrigan's
personality.

Charismatic? Yes, he was! (and he wasn't the only one). There is a powerful sense in the movie
of strong, yet kindly and very creative personalities. The movie leaves it to the viewer to decide
who propelled the actions forward the most- who kept organizing new ones at retreats and
meetings. Plainly, Phil Berrigan, George Mische and John Grady were key organizers.

Whoever broke in to the FBI  offices at Media Pennsylvania- where FBI's Counter Intelligence
Program was revealed, remained  unknown until 2014, On the front page of the New York Times
(1/7/2014), the story begins to come out. In her masterful book  The Burglary, Betty Medsgar
details this painstaking operation . To an email stating that we all thought John Grady did it, she
replies that Grady got a kick out of that but had stated it wasn't him. The FBI thought it was. It
was actually Bill Davidon and 7 ithers,

Bill Hartman  (member of the G.E 5) recalls the FBI had a nickname for Grady: ""Quicksilver"";
he slipped from their fingers. Bill  recounts a story re Grady's amazing laugh, that the had retired
to a pub in Philly one evening an d drank free all night as other customers paid John's tab- just
because of his laughter. It was thrilling, leprechaunish.

Weatherperson Bernardine Dorhn has told me that the weatherpersons felt at one with us in
their underground.

The actions, always creative, are in some instances ruined by informants and the FBI.
Filmmakers Joe and Skizz find a gripping narrative arc, even though the movie consists largely
of talking heads and interviews. Some of the participants seem to provide more of the glue to
hold the story together than others, people such as Jim Forest, George Mische, Dan Berrigan and
Dean Pappas.

Sadly, a number of crucial actors, such as John Grady and of course, Phil Berrigan have passed
on.

To me, Jim Harney and ""weather person"" Laura Whitehorn give some of the most moving
summaries and analysis of what we were trying to accomplish and ""were about"" and what still
needs to be done. Statements such as theirs make the message of the movie plain and clear one
and as relevant now as it will be in the future of war-making America.

Joan Nicholson stands by the side of the road near Kennett Square in Pennsylvania, singing
poignantly, ""How many kids have you killed today, Empire USA,"" a lone pillar of resistance as
cars rush by.

Bob Good describes a crucial moment in the trial of the Camden 28 where his mother sternly,
heartbreakingly, admonishes the jury: ""It is us - we have sent our boys away to this Vietnam
enterprise."" She came to realize, Good says, that one of her sons had died for oil, tin and rubber!
The 28 were acquitted in the only instance of jury nullification in the span of the draft action
trials, wherein a jury ignores the judge's admonition to follow his (i.e., the government's)
interpretation of the law. Harrisburg 8 defendants were also acquitted, although most of the trials
were (and continue to be!) railroad jobs.

Besides Ms Good's powerful witness, the  Camden 28 were victorious because the FBI`s
informant , Bob Hardy, after his son was tragically killed falling onto a fence spike from a tree,
had a change of heart and took the defnse side; he signed an afficavit that he had been a leader of
the group- as much as John Grady, and had enabled the action in key ways.

With all the work by Joe and Skizz - all of us participants learned a great deal about the other
actions previously known only in fragmentary fashion. To have big appreciative audiences as
well as friends present to watch the movie was very moving.

I am told there were portions of the documentary left on the cutting room floor- one concerned a group
that tried to make a citizens arrest on then Selective Service Director, Tarr. Turns out that they
could not get the handcuffs on him. A giant of a man, he threw one of them across the room.

They were ushered out by security and there was no coverage and no arrests.!

Another segment concerned some draft file destroyers, in Buffalo, as Joe recalls- who had
stripped down to socks and underwear so they could be more quiet. The polioce broke up the
action but6 tgwo escaped and ran through the city's ghetto in their skivvies!

Dan Berrigan's 92 birthday occurred on 5/11/13, the date of the second showing of ""Hit and
Stay"" at the Maryland Institute of Art. At Dan's 85th birthday celebration, , the noted author,
Kurt Vonnegut commented that Dan, referring to Jesus, was actually 2000!

The Camden 28 were acquitted in the only instance of jury nullification in the span of the
draft action trials (wherein a jury ignores the Judge's admonition to follow HIS, (i.e. the
government's) interpretation of the law. Harrisburg 8 defendants were also acquitted
although most of the trials were, and continue to be (in the Plowshare's actions) , railroad
jobs! In very few of these trials were the defendants permitted to argue from international law
or treaties  to which our Constitution says we must adhere (need Article citation) - such as the
Nuremberg Treaty, let  alone God's law or a higher moral law. It is always to be as the Judge
says- only the facts- did you destroy these records or not- to which facts the defendants always
admitted. The Court has the last word!

Indeed, it happened after ""Hit & Stay"" was completed but it could have been part of the story -
the July action by three Transform Now Plowshares protesters in which they vandalized a
weapons-grade uranium storage facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. (Begun in 1980 by the
Berrigan brothers, The Plowshares Movement against nuclear weapons is a direct descendant of
the anti-draft actions of the Vietnam era.)

During, the same week of the ""Hit and Stay"" showing, in a trial in Knoxville, Tennessee, the
three were found guilty of willful destruction of government property and injuring national
 defense premises with the intent to interfere with the national defense.
 The three activists awaiting sentencing after their July anti-nuclear action: (L to r) Michael R. Walli, Megan Rice and Greg Boertje-Obed. (Photo from transformnowplowshares.wordpress.com)
The Transform Now Plowshares 3 continued what we started.

Their link to the activist past couldn't be more direct. They had actually poured the blood of
Tom Lewis, preserved since his death (a member of the Baltimore 4 and several Plowshares
actions), on the walls of a building containing enough enriched uranium to end life on the
planet. They had hiked a mile to get there, going through four fences, the last three in ""Kill
Zones"" where they could well have been shot. The three, including one 82-year-old nun, Megan
Rice, were treated as terrorists!

At Transform's trial, the atmosphere was grim, their jury and judge seeming as leaden and dead
as in the trials portrayed in ""Hit & Stay.""But I take some encouragement from this film, and
hope it is a way to reach out to ""Middle America,"" and not just those of us who feel like a
minority of exiles in our own country.

Are these actions effective?,

Certainly the actors might argue they HAVE to act, if only for their own consciences. But others
might say that working within the structure- running Green Party candidates, for example- could
be MORE effective. To me, we get a little lost in the romanticism of such tactics- and there is a
danger of ""holier than thou"" or adapting martyr dom operations, as Al Queda would say- on
behalf of non-violence, that do not budge the odometer forward.

On the other hand, I think these actions are beautiful in the same fashion as is ballet- they are
impossibly beautiful- and perhaps, mystical. This side of my thinking- the Christian pacifist side,
does not reconcile with my Marxist revolutionary side. And yet you'd be surprised at how close
I come to a reconciliation,  mainly with the help of Howard Zinn.

Another side note to explore is - the influence of Catholicism, To me, persons who were in
the movie like Brendan and Willa Walsh- who enabled the Catonsville 9 and have always
supported the draft actions while at the same time they have run a Catholic Worker House-
VIVA House- for approximately  45 years in the slums of Baltimore. They perform acts of
mercy, a la Catholic heroine, Dorothy Day- AND, at the same time, acts of resistance- and their
attitude towards the establishment church is progressive,  to say the least. Dorothey Day and

Thomas Merton had troubles with the actions as perhaps being violent, but Ms. Day did come
around to supporting them. As is said- ""some property has no right to exist."" I don't know who
said that first- perhaps Daniel Berrigan.

Max Obuszewski raised a good point after the 2nd showing at MICA- that is- were Phil
Berrigan  here he would not want us wallowing in nostalgia  (leave it to Max to give a clarion
""call to arms""). He mentioned the upcoming Bradley Manning demo at Ft. Meade- (June 1) and

12/7/13- another showing of ""Hit and Stay"" at the Charles- Paul Meyer had just passed- you can
see his worsening health from earlier to later segments of the movie- my old friends are  fading
out and the movie becomes sort of a ruler for me.  Only 4 of the 9 left.....

The legacy of our actions? Howard Zinn put them in historical perspective- America's hopeful
history of non violent resisteance and resistance to the warlords- how things change- from our
blood pouring through to the Harrisburg conclusion of not guilty and the Camden trial's jury
nullification. Weather person, Laura Whitehorn, who was at the Baltimore City Jail when I
worked there, caught  on the Pennsylvania Turnpike with a carload of weapons- sums iot up in
the movie:  ""What kind of power do we have? We're not in the White Housew. We have the
power to make a moral statement, a political statement, to use our own lives to effect change.

You have to have some kind of faith, that society chan ges every time you go to demonstrate
You may not see it. You'll run into some one at some point and they'll say: ""I remember when
that demonstration happened and I was only 9 years old and it conviced me  to become an anti
nuke activist or whatever.""

Jim Harney says, in ""Hit and Stay"": ""When I look back on the Baltimore 4 and the Catonsville 9,
it makes me ask myself, what am I doing , how am I challenging the state or transnational
corporations, what am I doing now?""

One notices , refreshingly, how the anti draft action participants become younger and younger
Our idea caught on and was implemented in ever more creative ways. Walter Cronkhite, the
renowned broadcaster is hear intoning- ""over 271 draft board attacks in one year. (I don't know
what year that was- but it was a good one. And, to what did our work lead? ...an all volunteer
professional army  which as weather person Bill Ayers states, ""drafts through economic
hardship."" The military industrial capitalists can be fiendishly creative also.

As to George Mische's position that  ""anybody can do these actions""?  I'm not so sure, but
applaud his effort to de mythologize. Obviously, we had feet made of common clay- witness Phil
and Liz's damaging letters leading to Dan's capture and the Harrisburg Inditements. The
Harrisburg 8 were lucky to be acquitted, and as one of their lawyers, Ramsay Clark, once
Attorney General of the United States put it- it was perhaps the most dangerous trial of them all,
 given the charges they faced, not just conspiracy, but conspiracy to kidnap. Henry Kissinger
would have been a great target- and yet, as Liz McCallister put it, they would not have done it
and it would not have been non violent. The revolutionary German group- the Baader Meinhofs kidnapped a prominent
businessman and killed him. As to blowing up heating ducts under D.C.? As VIVA House

Catholic Worker, Berendan Walsh so wryly puts it in the movie: some property might not have a
right to exist."" Jim Forest, a member of the Milwaukee 14 and the expert on Dorothy Day states
that that's what Phil wanted to do and Phil and Paul Couming committed at least one act
towards fulfilling the action- finding a computer room where the heating duct computers were
located.

My old partner from the Baltimore 4, Rev. Jim Mengel puts it eloquently (Jim actually begins and ends the  ""Hit and Stay"" movie). Our leaders, as he puts it, ""are a danger to themselves and
others- the definition of insanity. "" And yet they are the ones the media covers and lionizes.

The movie deserves wide distribution and viewing on a wide basis; it may not achieve it due to the radical ideas therein- too much for most media.

But, like the PBS documentary on the Freedom Riders- this documentary will surely last- a portrayal of true ""patriots"" and a guidepost as to ""what is to be done"" to achieve real peace.",1410220800,5,18313,4.816150654324928
