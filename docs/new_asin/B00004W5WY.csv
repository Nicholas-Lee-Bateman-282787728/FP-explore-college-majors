7924896,5,B00004W5WY,"The beginning of series two (recorded in late 1993 and origanally transmitted in Britain in early 1994) got off to a great kick start with the classic episode, Hospital, where Patsy (played by delectable actress, Joanna Lumley) wishes to have cosmetic surgery but all goes horribly wrong. It was clear the series was back and was better than ever. Jennifer Saunders is even more flamboyant in the second series and is even more hilarious in doing so. It was quite obvious that the cast had become accustomed to their roles and it really shines through, with the series being in full swing. Both Saunders and Lumley sparkle together through these episodes as does the highly talented, Jane Horrocks in the role of the dizzy and totally incompetent, Bubbles. Horrocks is given more screen time than in the first series and her effective contribution is essential as are Joanna Sawahala as Edina's downtrodden daughter, Saffy and also June Whitfield in the amusing role of Edina's completley batty mother. All performances compliment the razor sharp script that bubbles with continually witty repartee. Totally superb. Other episodes on this video are classics (but then every episode of it's entire run was a classic) with Death, steering comfortably and gently into black comedy and the ultimate best on the video, Morrocco, where Eddy, Pats and Saffy go over there to promote Edina's new business venture, Pop Specs (the ""in"" sunglasses to wear, according to her). It's totally hilarious from beginning to end it's unique quality never falters. There has not been a funnier programme in Britain since this classic. Excellent and highly recommended!",991958400,6,1648,5.130111524163569
7924897,5,B00004W5WY,"Absolutely Fabulous - A British comedy show starring Jennifer Saunders (of French & Saunders) and Joanna Lumley (as I understand it, an otherwise award winning serious actress...)
Do you enjoy laughing?  Do you enjoy  satire?  OH you will luv AB FAB.... These are not the one dimensional  characters you find sprawling up all around TV Land everytime a network  wants to make a quick bundle off of teeny boppers.
These are videos you  will give away and purchase anew just to spread the word of AB FAB.
Edina dressed in awful designer fashions (the ones you always wonder:  Who would buy that?) and armed with Bali and Stali, conquers the PR world.  Well, by mistake actually. Her mothering, plain daughter is left in the  background of Edina's glamourous Look magazine wanna be lifestyle,  wondering:  Will my mother ever grow up and stay sober?
Ah, do not feel  bad or try and act offended, Saunders & co. will put you in  hysterics.......
Pats is Edina's oldest friend...well, the bond is there  but I do not know what to call it...she drinks constantly, enjoys  snow......and loves fashion and money, but hates Edina's  daughter........
Episode Guide:
HOSPITAL - Edina hurt her toe, and  Patsy has an affair.  Off to surgery.  Edina gets plastic surgery for her  toe and Patsy gets revamped to look 20 yrs younger for her HELLO magazine  interview...
DEATH - Edina's father dies, so she's off to buy some art.  This is the episode that Edina goes into a snotty art gallery and the  receptionist gives her some heavy attitude.

How many times  have you wanted to say that?

7924898,5,B00004W5WY,"If you are not familiar with Edina and Patsy but are a fan of Brit comedy you should absolutely check out AB FAB. Even when (although not often) the writing of the sketches are not completely up to par with Jennifer Saunders  ability, you are still roaring with laughter. As in a memorable novel, the  characters are superbly done and completely unforgettable.  When you turn  them on its like having an old, alcoholic, irresponsible, manipulating  friend coming back into your life. Only you can turn Edina and Patsy off  when you want them to go away. (But you won't want to)
This tape includes  the episodes ISO TANK, BIRTHDAY, and MAGAZINE.
ISO TANK - Saffron  prepares for her DNA presentation at University's opening day.  Meanwhile,  Edina is soaking in her isolation tank with Patsy and schemes a way to get  an invite to Saffy's presentation.  (In this episode however, things are  not always what they appear to be)
BIRTHDAY - Its Edina's 40th birthday  and she is definitely at her best when she is at her worst. (this epidode  alone deserves 5 stars) Saffy prepares a boring old dinner for her mummy  and invites (GASP) her 2 exhusbands and their new partners.
MAGAZINE -  Edina has a new man in her life and stays out all night long with him. What  in the bloody bullocks is Patsy supposed to do without her?",944524800,9,1321,4.620689655172414
7924899,5,B00004W5WY,Jennifer Saunders is a master of writing and acting.  She writes all of the shows and stars in them wich is a incredible.  Her supporting cast including Joanna Lumley (Patsy) finishes off the show to be totally  disfuctional in a funny way.  I only wish American tv can be this good.,930096000,,283,4.490196078431373
