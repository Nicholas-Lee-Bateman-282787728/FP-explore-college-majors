4932176,5,B0062AJOJU,"Lee Scratch Perry has a unique and fresh way of describing life. His choices are at the mercy of his own devout beliefs in the power of intuition and it makes for an exciting and enlightening perspective. While his words ooze with wisdom, his mistakes and unwise decisions give you an odd mixture of admiration and a reminder of the duality of human nature. Lee Perry transcends his role as music producer by being himself and saying true to himself- if you like Searching for Sugar Man, then you will definitely enjoy this :)",1388793600,2,526,4.6063829787234045
4932177,2,B0062AJOJU,"You do get some decent background here on Perry's roots, particularly in the film's first part.  But the makers don't manage to put the music's history into realistic perspective.  The narration (and much of Scratch's talking himself) would lead you to believe that he created reggae and dub, which is hardly the case.  Nor did Bob Marley owe him his career.  I would like to know more about why he thinks The Congos are the worst of all devils ... I would like to know more about his breakdown in the late 70's (to include burning down his studio) rather than just accepting that he had to get rid of bad spirits.  I do get a partial answer here on some of that though, because there's some old footage and some newer footage here of Perry that demonstrates what I realized already ... he's pretty far gone towards nuts.",1379462400,2,821,4.483221476510067
4932178,4,B0062AJOJU,"I saw Scratch perform live without fully knowing who he was. After reading his Wiki page, I became even more curious as to outrageous life so I purchased this DVD. It is incredible to think he basically invented dub and reggae! This DVD illustrates Scratch's life and portrays his legendary influence on the music industry.",1379376000,,323,4.890909090909091
4932179,3,B0062AJOJU,"Yes, it has archival footage I've never seen before, but wouldn't watch this too often - once every few years? It also has a somber narrator. Why? I suppose there are many narrative styles that may have been annoying, but a little bit more energy would have been better. And you don't really have to try and create a point and keep pushing it home repeatedly, let the viewers decide.",1356825600,,383,4.485714285714286
4932180,5,B0062AJOJU,"This is a very honest and accurate story of one of the most talented and by far, underrated musicians of our time. Mr. Perry is truly on his own wave-length, but, he speaks from the heart, nonetheless. Finally, an official documentary about the Godfather of, Rap, Dub, House, Trip-House, Drum and Bass!! A must for any music lovers, especially those who love Reggae music and are interested in it's foundation/roots.",1346457600,4,416,4.957142857142857

8491045,5,B0062AJOJU,"Must have for any reggae enthusiast and really for any music enthusiast in general.  This documentary took me into Jamaica, followed Scratch through his relocation to Europe, and touches base with the man in this new century.  What a life to have lived, and to be marinated in the sweet sounds of some of his best productions throughout the telling of that life story brings a closeness to the man, the music, the times, and the influence that Lee Perry has had on modern music.  It doesn't try to hide Scratch's notorious history but does reveal parts of the story that most of us never saw.  Just my opinion, but I got the feeling that Perry didn't start off as ""insane"", he just portrayed his unpredictable, uncategorizable persona so strongly that he made himself unhinged, almost willing his reality to bend to his will.... but only the reality in his head.  Not to spoil anything but I think there's a happy ending.
Watch it on a big screen with a good quality sound system and turn it up as loud as your neighbors will allow.
As a reggae DJ this must be considered required viewing.",1497398400,,1089,4.564102564102564

The Upsetter is a tremendous boon to reggae fans, and also a source of frustration. Its great in that it offers a rarely seen glimpse into reggaes golden era (roughly 1967-1980), and the life of one of its giants, Lee Scratch Perry, who wrote, performed, or produced many of the genres best songs in his famed Black Ark Studios. Theres rare footage galore, which is enough to get fervent fans salivating since theres such little visual documentation of reggae before the days of camcorders. The footage of Perry recording and clowning around in the studio is worth the price of admission. However, on the flipside, most of the story is told by Perry himself (with additional narration by Benicio Del Toro  a left-field choice to say the least), and besides being a musical genius, Perry is insane. There are subtitles whenever he speaks, but its still almost impossible to follow the convoluted maze of words and dense imagery he uses, and listening to him ramble for 90 minutes is draining. Plus he comes across so whacked out that you wonder how much of what he says is truth, and how much is an invention of Scratchs weed and rum-addled brain (lesson learned: if you want to be taken seriously when you speak, don't wear a plate of fruit as a hat and dye your beard bright red). I wish the directors had sought out input from the artists that Perry worked with (a list that includes The Clash, Junior Murvin, Paul McCartney, and Bob Marley among literally hundreds of others). It would have gone a long way to make The Upsetter a more coherent and historically informative film.
DVD bonus features: Two useless recent clips of Perry clowning around, which are less than two minutes combined.",1452297600,2,1763,4.853820598006645
