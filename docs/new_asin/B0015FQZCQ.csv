One of the things that that struck me was how everyone got along. There were people from all walks of life and they just got along.  I could be wrong because I wasn't there then and some footage could have been tossed, but the film showed some magic of humanity.

The Carrie Robinson dancing was great and I really liked Fannie Brewer's ""I Shall Overcome"".

As I think about it, so much of the film was without narration - the street sounds and visuals were all you needed.

(2008) (100 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- During its heyday in the early to mid-1900s, the Maxwell Street Market area represented one of the most fascinating chapters in American urban history --- People congregated there by the thousands to shop for bargains in stores and on pushcarts --- They went, too, for the endless entertainment of street musicians, including many of Chicago's blues greats, hucksters, rousing preachers, street entertainers and much more.

MAXWELL STREET IN POPULAR CULTURE:
1.  Maxwell Street is where the Maxwell Street Polish Sausage sandwich originated.
2.  The famous entrepreneur, Ron Popeil, began his career as a street vendor at the Maxwell Street Market.
3.  The Maxwell Street Police Station, at Maxwell and Morgan Streets, was ""Hill Street Station"" in the 1980s television series, Hill Street Blues.
4.  The musician and band leader Benny Goodman was born in the Maxwell Street neighborhood and spent most of his youth there. One of his first musical experiences was playing in the Boys Band at Hull House.
5.  Maxwell Street was featured in the 1980 film, The Blues Brothers, in which it was portrayed as a thriving ethnically African-American community. The scene features the two stars, ""Joliet"" Jake and Elwood Blues - played by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, looking for Matt 'Guitar' Murphy and Lou 'Blue Lou' Marini, to get their band back together. They enter the ""Soul Food Cafe,"" the exterior of which is actually Nate's Deli, formerly Lyon's Deli (the interior is a set). As they are entering, John Lee Hooker is playing ""Boom Boom"" on the street, and we see some typical street scenes, including the famous ""Cheat You Fair"" sign. Once the song ends, Jake and Elwood encounter Matt's wife, played by Aretha Franklin. When Matt becomes excited about the band getting back together, Aretha launches into ""Think."" In the end, much to Aretha's dismay, Matt turns his apron in, and hits the road with the Blues Brothers.

Maxwell Street is an east-west street in Chicago, Illinois that intersects with Halsted Street just south of Roosevelt Road. It runs at 1330 South in the numbering system running from 500 West to 1126 West --- The Maxwell Street neighborhood is considered part of the Near West Side and is one of the city's oldest residential districts --- It is notable as the location of the celebrated Maxwell Street Market and the birthplace of Chicago Blues and the ""Maxwell Street Polish (sausage sandwich)."" --- A large portion of the area is now the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), as well as a new private housing development sponsored by the university.

Shot on multiple Sundays during 1964 by director Mike Shea, you experience both the market atmosphere and the blues and gospel music. Mike Bloomfield had a behind-the-scenes role in getting this made.

Although it was released on VHS many years ago, ""And This Is Free"" has long been unavailable in any format.

In addition to Shea's documentary, you get Shuli Eshel's 2002 documentary, ""Maxwell Street: A Living Memory."" There's also a slide show about Maxwell Street produced and narrated by Shuli's partner, Roger Schatz.

The package also includes a CD of excellent Maxwell Street-related music, but if you want the real ""And This Is Free"" soundtrack recordings, you have to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-This-Is-Maxwell-Street/dp/B00004YN9X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">And This Is Maxwell Street</a>, Studio IT's 2001 release of all the music recorded for the film, plus Mike Bloomfield interviewing Robert Nighthawk.

That is this package's only flaw, the fact that they didn't or couldn't merge in the complete soundtrack recording. Although it seems to be readily available from resellers, it technically is out-of-print.
