4315230,3,B004BDOEZO,"The plot its great from the beginning, i hate to say ""i knew so"" but i knew that the man did not go to the moon just because. Thats what this is all about, having history involved kinda was the reason of having 4stars than 3 (to me)

The movie its entertaining from the beginning, however well this is a merely USA independence day movie type, just in time for 4th of july, this is where the Americans take all the credit and the Russians the blame... i wonder how the Russians took the movie message n i wonder if thats why they premiere the movie there.

SAM is the same old annoying scream like a girl guy with a slightly hotter GF if u into British accent girls with dirty blonde hair, which she seems more right to the job than the previous one... i mean this girl rocked the whole attack, runs, jumps, rescues on high heels! lets hope they didn't hooked up on real life like the passed one .. yay mate?

MOVIE: well its definitively a whole much better than part 2, however i cant really say that it blow my socks off.... it just kept me entertain enough that i couldn't skip a minute to go to the loo, so if u feel like peeing just go within the first 30mnts.

i won't comment on specific parts of the movie to avoid spoilers but:

First time i see a DODGE truck on a transformers movie...seriously... so funny enough its was only ONE! with a big logo of NASA on the door. i believe i saw a ford too but i cant put my money on that.

I thou that the last shuttle flight was next week july 8th....

I thou that the autobots could just transform into a plane and just fly away... but yet they need a shuttle to go beyond the earths atmosphere.

Boy i was wanting to go home and look for that airport firetruck for my collection of transformers but oh boy after the movie i don't want it anymore... he is such a traitor but maybe i will.. such a shame he is prolly the best transformers (to me)

The Movie its the same old, Decepticons trying to rule the world, thou this movie focused merely in USA.... i bet if they woulda try to set on a place like africa things woulda been better for them punks... however we seen what happened in Egypt, so i don't think it will matter or maybe it would've.. whats a shame is that Chicago will get a make up after this.

ACTION LOTS LOTS LOTS LOTS... this has MORE fights MORE attacks Much MORE robots of course all from the decepticons but no matter the number the autobots will always prevail.... on the the humanity ( USA army.... )

SCREEN in this case IMAX  3D .. NICE not excellent but passable.

3D wise ill say 90% of the movie was just converted in a VERY LOW way to 3D just like my Samsung TV does at home from a regular 2D source (where u can almost see the movie with the naked eyes). However there is COOL but fewer scenes where there is that deep 3D effect specially the 360 camera scenes, but again just a few.

IMAX wise we all know that there is only a few scenes taken with IMAX cameras or that are true IMAX, i wouldnt doubt only 25% or less is IMAX however the Digital IMAX does really make up for it, as if u were to watch it on analog u will kinda notice the non IMAX content if u put attention to it.
Still not any close to that AVATAR movie that we saw 2 yrs ago, but its definitively underneath  it =) is it worth the Xtra $$ yes but only on digital IMAX theaters

Bottom line.....this movie will be the summer HIT no doubt about that.... its a must watch !! for kids n kids inside of an adult, best yet if u have not seen the previous ones guess what it does NOT matter!!!!!!!",1309305600,,3545,4.101156069364162
4315231,5,B004BDOEZO,"Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that movie legit. Tons of laughs, emotion and of course the best action special affects you'll ever see. Definitely go see it if you loved the first 2 or even liked. You'll be into this one the whole way through",1309305600,7,254,4.204081632653061
4315232,5,B004BDOEZO,"I went into this movie with lofty expectations.  I found the first Transformers film to be a fun-spirited and exciting trip down memory lane.  The second movie--despite its obvious flaws--contained some truly awe-inspiring action scenes.  Thankfully the third and supposedly final installment proves to be the best film in the franchise; capturing the positives from both its predecessors and then some.

Dark of the Moon has a more serious tone than the first two movies.  Beginning with the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the movie sets up an alternate history (akin to X-Men: First Class) that brings a sense of gravity and meaning to the film.  As the movie moves from past to present, the audience is greeted by familiar characters--both human and mechanical.  To avoid any spoilers I will just state that the story is much more comprehensible than the first sequel's and the plot holes (while there may be a few) are nowhere near as noticeable or aggravating.  The stakes are higher this round with the final act playing like an alien invasion movie along the lines of Independence Day or the more recent Battle: L.A., except instead of a wise-cracking Will Smith or a melancholic Aaron Eckhart fighting off the invaders we get a bad-ass Optimus Prime.  The Autobot leader's character development is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the franchise.  The events of Dark of the Moon cause Optimus to move away from the Superman-esque leader of the original film and into the realm of a vengeful anti-hero.  Think the Punisher in the form of a giant robot.  The human cast is serviceable.  Shia LeBeauf's comedic chops are still amusing, while John Malkovich and (especially) Alan Tudyk provide further comic relief.  Megan Fox's much discussed replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is nowhere near as bad as everyone (myself included) expected her to be.  Her true acting abilities are still somewhat a mystery since half the time she is talking the camera is still mysteriously focused on her rear.

As always, the biggest draw in this type of movie is the action.  Dark of the Moon delivers in droves.  Say what you will about director Michael Bay; the man is capable of crafting some of the most exciting and inventive action scenes in modern cinema.  Thankfully, unlike some recent releases (I'm talking to you Green Lantern), this is one movie that leaves some of the best material out of its trailers and TV spots.  A chase between Bumblebee and his cohorts and three very animalistic Decepticons on the interstate towards the end of the first act is a jaw-dropping spectacle.

If this movie is as critically derided as was Revenge of the Fallen, then I am truly convinced critics just love to hate on Michael Bay.  Why they can suspend disbelief for similar fare such as Thor (which was good) or Iron Man 2 (which was a moderately enjoyable mess) while bludgeoning Transformers is lost on me.  Dark of the Moon is an excellent summer blockbuster anchored on several truly exciting action scenes.  Those looking for a sci-fi cinematic pallet cleanser to rid themselves of the disappointing and tepid taste of Green Lantern should check out Transformers: Dark of the Moon without hesitation.",1309219200,182,3222,4.935064935064935

4315234,5,B004BDOEZO,"Michael and I have been friends for almost 30 years now so naturally I got to see this before it comes out in theaters.  If you are a fan of the Transformers series, or movies in general, you will not be disappointed.  Some old favorites make their return in this one and once again the action is non stop and intense.  Megan Fox's replacement did not annoy me as much as I thought.  I am a huge Megan Fox fan so I was very leery of her absence.  All in all a wonderful movie going experience.",1302307200,12,493,4.09375

4315270,1,B004BDOEZO,"Another movie that teaches that killing and using guns to kill is a way to solve problems and somehow is fashionable. Hollywood has brainwashed us to love guns and killing and has promoted violence and violent behavior. This in turn has produced murderers and mass murderers.

The movie insulted my intelligence at so many levels with stereotypes of women, gays, asians, afro-americans, and the concept of ""the bad guy"".

It seems that it's too mature a movie for anyone under 13 but it insults the intelligence of anyone over 14. That leaves them with a very limited number of satisfied viewers.

You can make an entertaining film using CGI without the overriding message being that ""killing is good"".",1510358400,,702,4.932203389830509

4315288,4,B004BDOEZO,"I'm seriously surprised at most of the reviews that streamed about this movie. I think that critics and movie reviewers need some perspective, this is a Michael Bay film about transforming robots that kids used to play with (including me), so I went in with the right amount of expectations and got a very impressive visual experience. Now I'm not giving Micheal Bay an excuse to make a bad film but as far his movies go, this is definitely one of his finer ones.

It has both its pros and cons. Pros: The story is a HUGE improvement over the second one, with some good twists added there and then, albeit a bit long. Now it's not Phenomenal story telling but acceptable enough for a good fun summer action film. The character development is able to keep me watching since the second one had absolutely NONE of it. The SFX are fantastic. This movie has the best CGI out of all 3 in the trilogy. Even the smallest robots look very realistic. The action scenes are AMAZING. I could actually differentiate between the good guys and bad guys this time, its amazing how much more depth it adds to the scenes. The highway scene is my favourite from the movie. The robots also get a lot more screen time and pay a more important part to the story than before. Unlike in the second one, each robot gets a fair amount of screen time and does something useful instead of just being the military's attack dogs.

The cons: The humor is unnecessary and unfunny, although it has been cu down to minimal amounts .The romance is useless and awkward. The two main leads don't have any chemistry and I don't see why Shia needs to be paired up with a hot supermodel every film (or why he still even needs to be there at all). The acting is meh, shia and josh are great but the rest of the cast is pretty...meh. Rosie has very little acting talent, although she is a slight improvement over megan fox in terms of acting. The soundtrack is awesome but it sounds very very similar to the scores in the Dark Knight and Inception. The decepticons are still portrayed as mere evil destruction machines who hate everything, i wish they were more developed characters and that the relationships between the robots were explored more, I mean, whenever any bot dies, the others are literally cool with it two seconds later and do not mention the incident again. (SPOILER) Megatron is no longer the evil villain bent on dominian, instead he's simply the anti hero who is solely focused on saving his planet, HE EVEN SAVES PRIME'S LIFE at the last second simply because Rosie called him sentinel's bitch(SPOILER).The biggest problem which I had with the ending is that it is wrapped up too quickly, another 2 mins would have been fine. The movie's run time is very long, the first hour could've been done in 10 minutes.

Overall I think the movie is able to deliver a very entertaining experience. Yes the trilogy would have been better in different hands but I was able to enjoy it as much as I did the first one. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary or brilliant, turn of your mind, ready the pop corn and enjoy.

4315318,3,B004BDOEZO,"I so love Transformers, but the series keeps going down. Much like the second movie, I only really like this one because of the special effects (Gosh they do an awesome job making the Transformers so cool) and that it's a Transformers movie. The story has almost no interest whatsoever. You start to wonder what is really wrong with humanity, that they just turn on their saviors. The story sucks but is tolerable. Once again most of the Transformers, except Optimus and Bumblebee, Starscream and Megatron, feel completely pointless and you don't give a flip what happens to them or to any of the humans by now. What started out as likeable characters had disintegrated into a mad grab for million or billions of bucks, to saps like me, who will probably pay to go see any Transformer movie, (unless it sinks too much lowers). I do wish they'd had planned a certain amount of movies and written a storyline that encompassed all the movies in the series. The 2nd and 3rd movies have so many plot holes, and get rather predictable and blah.

4315343,4,B004BDOEZO,"I really enjoyed this 3rd movie in the Transformers franchise.  Unlike the 2nd film (Revenge/Fallen, which was too long and appeared to leave nothing on the cutting room floor, to its detriment),  this film was relatively short and concise, to the point, and without a lot of filler.  It had a somewhat more serious tone than the previous 2 films too.  Although the first film is special, in that it gave us new sci-fi characters in a fresh format, this film expanded the Transformer universe well.  And the tie in with our 1969 moon landing was cool too.",1484265600,3,555,4.622448979591836

It's not that Transformers isn't high brow enough for me, it's that it doesn't even throw me a bone. The effects are amazing but the dialog is super, super, I mean super flat. And the gentle voices of the giant robots wear me down. This movie has it's audience and I tried but failed to join it. Maybe the first movie was good but it was not available on Amazon. This was the earliest in the serious I could easily watch. Lots of stuff about the lead character feeling he should get more credit for saving the world twice. I get that, but the story failed to win me over. One star for cast and the other for effects. Script killed the other stars.",1441065600,,816,4.305194805194805

come to Earth and the plot thickens. i watched it with my nephew.
we looked all over the internet for this movie even on
Netflix and could not find it. But i found it here on Amazon
prime video. Guess my trial is paying off.
Movies here used to be nonexistent and sparse and expensive.
But i see a lot of free ones wish all were free to rent at least

4315608,3,B004BDOEZO,"THE FILM: Isn't Transformers supposed to be fun? The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this threequel's credit, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the ""real"" reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest (and greatest?) scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that probably looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius (along with an obligatory Star Trek reference/quote). What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process.

THE EXTRAS: This time around, the special features are a little leaner, but still provide a decent look behind the scenes of the film. As with the previous two, the bulk of the material is contained in a multi-part making-of documentary, this time clocking in at around 110 minutes. It covers the same areas (pre-production/development, shooting, stunts, VFX, post-production, etc.), but does so in a more streamlined way. As with REVENGE, it addresses the previous entry leading into the current one. However, this time they talk a little bit about how the reception REVENGE received wasn't as great as they'd hoped. They actually own up to the major reasons why the last one didn't do as well (critically), i.e., the writer's strike and an over-abundance of characters (meaning that they weren't developed that well). They even address Megan Fox's not returning, although they fudge the reason a little bit. Then they go through the usual routine of behind-the-scenes footage combined with talking-head interviews as they discuss everything from the location shooting to the extensive work on stunts and VFX. Particularly impressive in this area is just how much of the aerial stunts were achieved for real. It also boggles my mind how much time it took to render a single frame in the collapsing building sequence with Driller/Colussus (288 hrs for each eye!). And the fact that they accomplished this in roughly the same amount of time as the previous one just attests to Michael Bay's work ethic, no matter how difficult he might be. My favorite part of the documentary was actually the section that dealt with sound design. It went a long way to show how creative the sound team was in coming with new sounds for the different sequences in the film. Besides the documentary, the most interesting feature was an half-hour featurette on NASA. As with the previous film's home release, they have a handful of previs/animatics with commentary, as well as an in-depth look at how several of the VFX shots were achieved and composited, also with commentary. Again, it provided some valuable and interesting information about the work that went into making the stunning visuals. Rounding out the video extras were several shorter featurettes, mostly 2-3 minutes apiece, that cover the premiere, the ""Birdmen"" sequence, and a longer 9 minute featurette on the sound design. A lot of this had footage that was already in the longer ""making-of,"" but it was still interesting. There was also a rather sweet clip of Michael Bay giving a disabled fan an iPad. There was also a small collection of marketing material, consisting of a couple trailers and a gallery of tie-in merchandise and posters. The other non-video extra is an art gallery with Transformers concept designs, as well as some of the locations. Put together, it is a somewhat slimmer package than was provided with REVENGE, most notably lacking any audio commentary on the main feature, but it is a good one nonetheless.

OVERALL: To be honest, the only reason I bought this limited 3D edition was because it had extra special features. I don't yet have 3D home viewing capability, so I apologize for not being able to comment on its presentation in that way. Still, for the Transformers fan, this is most likely the edition you will want to buy. My actual opinion of the films notwithstanding, they are treated well in these home video editions, so you'll at least get some bang for your buck. And if you watched/bought the previous two, getting this third one is really a no-brainer.",1436400000,2,5691,4.890269151138717

4315618,1,B004BDOEZO,"There is a lot that I will put up with in an explosion-heavy, FX-driven summer blockbuster action flick. Paper-thin excuse plot? Sure. Mediocre acting? As long as things are blowing up. Not much character development to speak of? Throw in some good car chases and maybe a hot guy with his shirt off/partially ripped to shreds and we'll call it even. But the one thing...the ONE THING that KILLS this film for me is the horrendous leading lady!!

And, no, it's not because she's a sexy blonde girly-girl instead of a sexy brunette gear-head like the previous two films. Ooooooh no! As a woman, I totally understand that there are many women with various different interest profiles in this world. No. The big whammy here is that this chick is a selfish, whining, useless, brainless, freakishly naive, childish, worthless excuse for a woman!! All she ever does in the entire movie is throw tantrums and do incredibly stupid crap!! I mean, seriously? Any woman in the typical age range to have graduated college knows DARN WELL that if a rich, powerful man who is not related to you GIFTS YOU with ANYTHING mega-expensive, then he's up to something...Typically, trying to get you in bed with him.

And if her glaring genre-blindness about being a woman is not bad enough, she is also one of those annoying women who seems to think that a man is supposed to completely change who he is, drop his friends, cast aside his pre-existing obligations and selfhood...JUST to satisfy her piddling little whims and feelings! I mean, seriously, it's basically all about HER with this chick!! She literally rips a stuffed rabbit's foot off and throws it at Sam when he tells her he has to go save the world again...Even knowing, for a fact, that he has a tendency to get dragged into those sorts of things every couple of years!! She knew that when she MET HIM!!! For crying out loud, she met him when he was getting his medal for saving the world THE LAST TIME!! How any grown woman can be so stupid, selfish, and conceited, I have no freaking idea...but she IS!!!

In fact, the whole mess near the end of the movie is ALSO her fault, because her overly-generous boss (spoiler alert) is one of the bad guys and that awesome car that Sam warned her about is a freaking Decepticon!!! I mean, there's a part in this movie where she's sliding across the floor of a falling building to a long, deadly fall...and all I could think was, ""Please, let her die. Please, let her die. Please let her DIE!"" I was actually genuinely disappointed when they saved her stupid butt! I have NEVER hated a fictional character so much that I was disappointed when they weren't horribly killed off!!

The only useful thing she does in the ENTIRE FILM is when Sam sends her to go tick off Megatron...because whining, arguing, and ticking people off is apparently the only thing she's good for. Then, the kicker here, is that Bumblebee tells Sam to MARRY HER at the end of the movie!! What. The. Eternal. Crap. Did Sam get Bee's paint job scratched in a parking lot one time or something and he's getting back at him for it? Because the only thing that I can see being married to a chick like that being is a horrific punishment. And what kind of message is that sending the boys and young men watching this film? That the only marriage-worthy women in this world are the selfish, annoying harpies who appreciate literally NOTHING about who you truly are and, instead, seek only to change you to fit her personal vision of Prince Charming?! Bull crap!!

So, avoid this movie at all costs. It was obviously written by a guy who had been having woman-troubles with some horrible harpy of a lover who did him wrong and he's translated that experience into Sam's relationship with his new girlfriend. Instead, skip right to ""Age of Extinction"". The Female lead in that one is a LOT more respectable. Plus, it has Optimus Prime riding Grimlock into battle. If you watch ""Age of Extinction"" for nothing else, watch it for that.",1434758400,2,3983,4.620056497175141

Michael Bay's directing is a lot more stylish than the first two, particularly the action scenes. The filmmakers put a lot more time and effort into this film.
The opening moon landing scene is great. For the first 10 minutes of the film, you completely forget your watching Transformers.
The film is so much darker than the first two films(well, mostly in the film's second act). I swear to God, the middle of the film is like the Star Wars Episode 3 of the Transformers movies. It lightens up considerably after a plot twist.
During the first and third acts, when the film is relatively light, Michael Bay brings back the laugh out loud, hilarious humor from the first two films in spades!

4315675,4,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon
 The space program that ended spectacularly in several moon landings by American heroes resulted in the snatching of alien artifacts.  These artifacts had a connection, a direct and real connection, with the Transformers and their desperate, villainous mechanical life form enemies, the Decipticons.  Transformers: Dark of the Moon spends the first half hour or so of the film with nostalgic film clips of JFK speechifying about the moon missions.  That is good fun.  It doesnt add a bit to character development, however.  Character development is always a problem with special effects driven summer blockbusters and this one is no exception.
 Silly me, as a human, I focused on the human characters in the first two Transformer films, both of which also had the knowledgeable hand of Michael Bey as director.  Director Bey knows how to build a film that people like to see.  His average lifetime take is $187 million per film, which we know to be an amazing achievement.  But I panned both of his Transformer flicks as soulless exercises in mayhem.  I never tweeked to the fact that the humans are not the stars, the mechanical life forms, the Autobots, are the stars.
 The Autobots actually became individualized to me in Dark of the Moon.  They even had personalities of a sort, at least as much as one can expect from what are at bottom, really big robots.  My error seems to have been in assuming that since the humans had most of the lines and had most of the screen time, that they were what the film was about.  Clearly, I am mixed up.
 The only recognizable Autobot is a new character called Sentinel Prime.  He is wickedly portrayed by the voice of Leonard Nimoy.  The humans include the rising new star, Shia La Beouf, who is good enough and photogenic enough to be an action star for a few more years.  He cannot hold a candle, photogenic wise, to his co-star, new to the silver screen, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.  Rosie replaces Megan Fox as the leading lady.  Her career thus far has been as a model for Victorias Secret.  She accomplished the seeming impossible, erasing all memory of the fetching Miss Fox.
 A very strong supporting cast elevates this one well above its predecessors, so far as my personal enjoyment is concerned.  The always watchable Franceses McDormand plays the uptight national security czar who is wooed by John Turturro in his most exhilarating role since You Dont Mess with the Zohan.  We also note John Malkovich, who adds to any project and Alan Tudyk.  Tudyk appears as the assistant to the Turturro character in the best individual effort of the film.  Fans will remember him fondly form the iconic SiFy TV series, Firefly.  Handsome Patrick Dempsey plays against type as the vile traitor who sells out the human race to mechanical mass murderers.
 Transformers: Dark of the Moon runs a full 154 minutes, that is two hours and 34 minutes.  We get full payment for our movie viewing dollar.  Even with a huge budget of $195 million, this one will make a bundle.  The world wide take is already around $372 million.  I learned to not fight the box office.  People like movies like this and will pay to see them by the million.  This three and a half saw blade movie is not Shakespeare by any estimate.  It is a big, very loud summer movie, and a lot of fun to watch.  You will surely see this PG-13 rated movie even if I suggest you pass it by.  So enjoy, have fun and get the big sized drink and pop corn.  It is a long movie and the extra supplies will prevent you from missing a minute of it.",1427068800,,3570,4.624203821656051

But one problem can up, the Decepticons made Sentinel escape look to good. The ship was damaged and crashed on the moon and Sentinel went into hibernation with only one problem he could only be reawakened by another prime. So during the time they were waiting for Sentinels return the Decepticons moved parts of the space bridge in passion and made human alleys.

The movie itself is a summer popcorn spectacle that's all about destruction. The autobots are not the main focus like in the first movie, I miss that, how they are related to each other like a family. Since the second movie all supporting characters are forgotten in the background, used to fill the frame, nothing more.

I just bought this movie to have my collection complete. The bonus features/behind the scenes stuff were great in the previous movies, unfortunately there is no second disc on this product.",1419984000,,637,4.738738738738738

If you need to pass the time and not really looking for an ""eye opening"" experience, then go ahead watch this movie.

4315832,2,B004BDOEZO,"This really isn't a movie for kids in my opinion its way over the top and quite violent in some areas (just without blood)  I found the action sequences to be extreamly over the top to the point of being obnoxious I mean its almost if half of the movie had no real plot other then lets see how many buildings and robots we can smash together in the most ""cool looking"" way possible.  and a lot of the plot felt like nothing but another genetic ""military vs ""the big threat of the day""  thing with the obligority ""cliche"" ""a bunch of people not part of the battle sitting in a room mentoring it on their screens""  I just think this movie was just done to be the shallow ""big budget lets see how much crap we can have exploding and fly all over the place""  Honestly watching this in theatres might make some people sick (not due to the over violence just the extreame amount of over the top destruction scenes they throw at you.  I just think honestly it shows that in this day and age the CGI movement has gone overboard in some cases where instead of providing movies with depth they create the explosion fest.

I admit there were one or two scenes that seemed interesting from a cinimatic point of view.  but other then that  after a while i got sick of watching it. Only did so because i was watching it on tv with a friend i was hanging out with.

Not really a family movie and i cant see how parents more so mothers would enjoy it at all just

very hard to follow for some people too.

if you are an over the top high action CGI fan who wants to see a lot of stuff blowing up in redilous ways sure its the movie for you

but id say as a ""family movie"" not so much.  they could have toned it down just a tad and still made a good movie in my opinion.",1416700800,,1753,4.072886297376093

4315888,1,B004BDOEZO,"No! No! You screwed it up!
Bay RUINED the decepticons, but I'll to that
The plot is basically the Cons want to bring Cybertron to Earth via some pillars controlled by a new old prime named Sentinal. There is not much transformer action in this movie
Now, for the ""Decepticons."" Other than a few, all of them are nameless mindless drones. The few that were named are Megatron, Shockwave, Soundwave, Starscream, and the main baddy who I will not say his name. Megatron has gone insane and mostly stands or sits around speaking trailer talk, until his head gets torn off by Prime, WITHOUT A FIGHT! There is no big Prime Vs Megatron fight at the end! Megatron stands there while Optimus, a ONE ARMED OPTIMUS, takes his head off.
Ok, well maybe Shockwave, my second favorite Transformer and one of the few Megatron fears, will be better. . . Hahahaha no! He literally just stands there ominously. No lines (Which I would be fine with seeing how it fits his character if he DID SOMETHING) HIS GIANT WORM PET DOES MORE THAN HIM! He never kills anyone, and is killed by Optimus with ease by getting his eye torn out and head blown up
Soundwave, my fave, is the worst! He is a moron in this. He does nothing, and there is a scene where he captures 5 bots, and he doesn't go ""Hm, all of there guys have some kind of weapon on their arms, maybe we should take their arms off."" He gets his head blown off by Bee, as does his sidekick Laserbeak, who does more than him.
You'll never guess how Scream dies. His head explodes (What's with head hate?) He does nothing but grovel the whole time
Main baddy kills one bot and gets his head taken off.
Meanwhile, the bots lose 3 outa 13, and, big shock, other than Bee and Optimus, we spend time with Wheelie (Gosh no, please. He was so annoying and perverted in the first 1) and a sidekick just as pervy named Brains. Other than that There is Ratchet, who does nothing, Ironhide, who kills a con, Dino, who kills a con in the coolest way ever, The wreckers, rip apart a con, Sideswipe, nothing major, Que,  does nothing, and a few more  I can't remember
All in all this movie is just terrible, and not good terrible like the others, but bad terrible. Pass this one up, I beg of you. Andd, wait, how is it that 14 bots could take out an army of cons and lose 3, but they lost the war on cybertron?
That is my review. If you liked, feel free to like or comment, if not, sorry to waste your time",1412812800,2,2423,4.276688453159041
4315889,5,B004BDOEZO,"I only love this movie because I am a loyal fan of Transformers. The movie itself is compelling and beautiful, but many people say this is the worst one out of the three on the market. I personally think they're too picky and cant enjoy something for what it is and need to find something else to nitpick. It is a wonderfully crafted movie that despite occasional poor performance by the actors needs respect for the intuitive design and the hard work everyone on that team did in order to give us a wonderful piece of cinema.",1412726400,,526,4.43298969072165

4315932,4,B004BDOEZO,"I thought that the first Transformers was a good cinematic introduction to this franchise.  I thought the second movie was almost garbage but mostly because of about three recurring elements that really bugged me.  So it's a matter of taste.  I think that the third installment has been the best all around.  With some nice casting (McDreamy as the bad guy? great choice!) and giving a bit less screen time to series star Shia LaBeouf--though still playing neurotic at least he wasn't crazy this time around--allowed for more of a balance to be played out with returning and new characters.  But, most importantly, we see a new Decepticon threat emerge that seems overwhelming to humanity and turns the small Autobot crew into an almost Magnificent Seven type of special ops team to manage a hail mary touchdown pass to save the day.  Whereas ""Revenge of the Fallen"" felt like there was no way the Autobots should have been able to overcome the Decepticons, ""Dark of the Moon"" acknowledges this same feeling but plays out the script in an exciting but sensible fashion.  It feels more like a war movie, and they done good.",1409270400,2,1122,4.782383419689119

4315971,1,B004BDOEZO,"I'm honestly at a loss. I don't know how to begin. All I can do is try to explain the thing I watched.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third object in Michael Bay's project six-installment series. As of the writing of this review, four have been released, and have made billions of dollars, yet are slammed mercilessly by critics and Bay is seemingly ignorant of that criticism, because in Dark of the Moon, nothing has changed from No. 2, Revenge of the Fallen. It's almost as if Bay made the same movie a third time. Let's start with the supposed plot.

There is more of a plot in Transformers 3, if plot is defined by length and amount of on-screen action. Using that definition, Transformers 3 has enough plot to bury Charles Foster Kane, Colonel Kurtz, and Don Vito Corleone under heaping, stinking mounds of plot. Much of this plotting concerns Transformers, which are from space and speak in various Earth accents. There are two factions of robots, called the Decepticons and the Autobots. Guess who the villains are? Along with the aforementioned giant space robots, human characters assembled from every stereotype imaginable exist. They are called characters, because they speak dialogue and move about. Are they important to Bay's plot? Transformers 3 is beyond such petty questions. The humans are there because most movies involve humans of some sort- a movie being something Transformers desperately wants to be.

Next, onto the rest of the non-movie. The music is reminiscent of any Hans Zimmer film score remixed by Leni Riefenstahl and thrown in a blender set to suck. In Transformers 3, more so than any other Transformers, it is blasted at unholy decibel levels, qualifying it for what is called ""epicness."" Although many poorly spelled Youtube comments declare many things to have ""epicness,"" it is not known why. Transformers 3, so says the massess, has epicness. It has many other things, which is all that can be said in its favor.

The most important segment of Transformers 3 is the hour-long battle scene at the relative end of the non-movie. Robots fight other robots in a city. There are countless explosions. Gunshots and orders and more plot assault the senses. The city is nearly destroyed. Robots explode. Buildings explode. A planet made of metal explodes. This is Bay's directorial vision; confusion and noise and senseless, lunatic action that is more overwhelming than entertaining. When the credits roll, there is a feeling of certainty- there will be many more Transformers non-movies. They will be exactly like this one.

Some criticism has been directed at Transformers for being either racist, or sexist, or both. That's not important. Transformers is a new kind of entertainment, part of a category shared with The Expendables series and most recent Hollywood action objects. These alleged movies are filled to bursting with cruddy dialogue, utterly forgettable characters, relentless special effects, and make billions of dollars no matter what critics say. It's part of the new Hollywood. Transformers and its fellows are created on computers, advertised and promoted to the point of being inescapable, and like another component in Bay's Hollywood machines, are seen by millions of people.

With every Transformers non-movie, they grow longer and longer, with more special effects and worse, more unbelievable words being spat by actors that might as well not be there. The only philosophy that can be drawn from Transformers 3 or any other Michael Bay production is nihilism. Transformers exists without purpose, divorced from all logic and reason and bereft of any redeeming factors. And still more are on the way.

Transformers: Age of Extinction is in theaters now. Get in line.",1406851200,,3734,5.081566068515498

The  3-D  the  friggin  spectacular  the  amount  of  depth  is  absolutely  staggering  and  beautifully  handled  kudos  to  Mr. Bay  for  bringing  us  the  most  chaotic  action extravaganza so far.  It  is  also  worth  mentioning  that  when  i  was  watching  the  3-D  version  i  went  to  the  set  up  menu  and  i  set  the  audio  to  7.1  and  when  i  hit  the  select  button  on  my  ps3  controller,  which  shows  the  stats  and  what  audio  is  being  used  it  showed  up  as  dolby digital  5.1  i'm  not  sure  if  anyone  else  has  this  issue  but  it  wasn't  bad,  the  5.1 dolby digital  track  was  still  amazing, but  then  i  got  curious  what  if  the  2D version  had  the  same  issue  so  i  switched  the  discs  and  the  2D  version  played  the  7.1  track  that  was  just  weird.",1404518400,,1323,4.295774647887324

Sure, the plot was a bit dumb(and holed), Megan Fox got a bit irritating(too much botox) and the script sounded as if it had been penned down by a 13 yo. But still, the movie was big on action sequences and CGI. And thats what Bay prolly wanted to deliver - some awesome robot madness.

4316031,1,B004BDOEZO,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Transformers 1, terribly disappointed at the blatant racism, sexism and U.S. flag-waving (as perpetrated by the Autobots)of T2, and turned off T3 near the end. I thought, just finish watching the damn thing, but no - I'd had enough. Enough of excellent actors (Malkovich, McDormand, Turturro) speaking horrible lines w/a straight face, the obligatory Bay-girl who'd replaced Megan Fox and was there only for teens to pitch a tent to. Advanced robots from another world that think just like humans, have blue eyes to denote ""good"" (just like people think) and red eyes to denote ""evil."" Evil Decepticons robots that are animalistic in appearance because, as humans know, animals are savage and stupid. Lots of phony baloney, albeit veiled, grandstanding about U.S. values as said by the Autobots (""Humans love their freedom"" and other crap-worthy, trite sentiments about individualism and sticking up for each other). The orchestral music and other pop music tracks that pipe in to underscore the drama. I was cringing at that so much, and I was sitting alone in my living room. A plot about some nonsense that will end the world, but who cares amidst the ear-rupturing clanging of robots and explosions. Everything's exploding, the sidewalks, the sky, the flowers. Bay can't tell us enough how much he covets the fine art of blowing s*** up like a madman every ten minutes. If you're under 14, are male and have an average or less IQ, then you definitely need to invest some time here; everyone else, Transform and avoid this POS movie.",1404086400,,1574,4.965909090909091

4316034,2,B004BDOEZO,"I am old enough to remember the Transformers series of the 80's. Yes it was cheesy, but I loved it.

The rebooted live-action has been hit-and-miss with me, and sadly this is more miss than hit.

The plot is that the Autobots discover a dead leader on the moon, who turns out to be more than meets the eye, and the Decepticons attack in order to bring Cybertron to Earth and enslave humanity.

If you are a fan of the previous two films, you will love this; transforming robots, big guns, bigger explosions, lot of running around, some very hot women, a major crisis... you get the idea.

However, for me, this movie suffers with the same problems at Revenge of The Fallen - what plot there is (and it is limited), makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

SPOILER WARNING
If Sentinel was defecting to the Decepticons at the beginning of the movie, why did they shoot him down and lose all that cool technology?

Optimus and the Autobots spend large chunks of this movie, not being where they should be and thus making a bad situation worse... but with no explanation.

When they do turn up, it is evident that the Autobots have been to the General Custer school of military tactics - they allow themselves to be divided, with no attack co-ordination.

Why do the bad guys have to tell their captives the one weak spot in their whole plan? I mean come on!

Ultimately, the action pieces are fantastic and the CGI is near perfect... but the script is full of holes that made me feel like I had wasted my time.",1404086400,,1505,4.463503649635037

4316040,3,B004BDOEZO,"Wow....looks like a lot of people HATE this movie?? While I have to say that it's probably my least favorite of the three (so far) films, it's not awful. (Of course I just sat through all 9 of the ""Children of the Corn"" movies...so just about anything looks good in comparison).

As the movie opens we get another voice-over from Optimus Prime, this time telling us that during the civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, a new Autobot technology was created which could put an end to the war, with victory for the Autobots..unfortunately, the ship., called the ARK,  containing the new technology was destroyed and it crashed into our Moon. The government knew something had landed on the moon and this fueled the space race of the 1960's. Apollo 11 discovers the wrecked ARK and giant robots within.

In present time while trying to help humans maintain the peace on Earth, Optimus Discovers a chunk of the ARK in Chernobyl. The Autobots leave for the Moon and find the ARK wreckage, and the body of Optimus' mentor, Sentinel Prime. Sentinel was considered the ""Einstein"" of Autobot society, and created the technology which could finally end the war, and Optimus begins the process to revive Sentinel.

Meanwhile Sam is trying to find a new job and doesn't want to rely on his new girlfriend for help. Sam is hired by a technology firm and it's not long before San learns that the Decepticons are on the move again, and that he must alert the Autobots to stop the evil robots from destroying the world.

This film has a much darker tone than the previous two, and while there are some laughs sprinkled here and there, ""Dark of the Moon"" is much more serious than the previous installment. The special F/X are top notch, and the fight scenes are really amazing to watch, especially the scenes with Driller and Shockwave. I like too that they've added human antagonists in this film for Sam to deal with.

With that said, it felt like it took way too long to actually get to the robot action? The first hour of the film is very talky, and for the most part it's fairly dull; job hunting, parent issues, jealousy stuff. Once the movie kicks into high gear, about an hour in, I'm really ready for some action...and it delivers, but the first half of this film is kind of a slog to get through.

Recommended for fans of the first two, but I don't recommend you try to start here as it would be tough to pick up the storyline.",1403827200,,2435,4.545662100456621

4316077,1,B004BDOEZO,"I absolutely hated this film. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS. Also, contrary to my principles, I will try to keep that one short.

""Transformers"" movies have for only purpose to entertain and amuse us. The first one was in this aspect rather succesful, the second was absolutely not and this one is much worse even than the second one, for following reasons:

- even an action film about giant robots needs a scenario; it shouldn't be so hard to write the scenario of a film about giant robots (my chipmunks wrote a couple of those); but in this film there is no scenario. At all. Meaning somebody in Hollywood took a great lot of money for doing absolutely nothing. Lucky bastard.

- the film is impossibly boring and much too long

- there is no humour; not even ONE good joke (some lame ones though)!

- too much of darn Sam Nitwicky (which also means much too much of darn Shia LaBeouf). This character was the least succesful thing in the first film, was more or less annoying in the second one and in this one he is simply unsufferable.

- Sam parents were supposed to be funny - they are just obnoxious jerks

- Megan Fox is gone and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a poor substitute; OK, granted she has a great figure - but her character is perfectly useless, hardly says anything and for most of the film she only runs after a bunch of soldiers so they can save her when she gets in trouble

- you can't really watch this film with your kids - the language is too strong, even for a 12 years old;

- noble Optimus Prime acts in this film like a total @hole - and also a murderer!

- my favourite character from the series for which I rooted all my childhood gets stupidly whacked at the end (sob!), after putting up a fight which lasts a great total of three flipping seconds!!

- Starscream is present, but he is just a pathetic, miserable, crawling lackey, strong only against the most helpless...

- for a supposedly great character Sentinel looks really pathetic

God, I hated this film! After like 50 minutes I just wanted it to finish already but I kept watching it hoping for at least a great finale - but the supposedly grandiose Chicago fight was a big let down. Only the Driller was a brighter point, but well, he was not enough to carry this film alone. I am so glad that I rented it instead of buying!

I like associating the autobots and decepticons with those I remember from my childhood.  Because they were so metallic I had trouble recognizing who each of the transformers were in all 3 of the movies.  I think that the plot could be more interesting too, and I want the characters developed more.

I most admit that I prefer Megan Fox's character to this new heroine.  Casey was okay but I get tired of helpless woman in action movies.  Megan Fox could fight with the best of them.

I can only hope the 4th movie in the series has more plot and character development.  Also, I would like to be able to recognize the autobots and decepticons in the movie this time.",1393200000,2,850,4.546052631578948

I really disliked how they try to appear to be the first men on the moon, again appearing to be better, being this and that. In reality we all know that the first landing on the moon was staged, so why even bother go further with lies? Screw it. The nation has always been arrogant. Funny how in the movie nobody can survive anything, but the main ''heroes'' that are made of steel and just won't die and getting to secret facilities for newbies is easier than anything.

4316153,2,B004BDOEZO,"This movie started off with a close-up of the female lead's behind, and what followed was a mixture of gratuitous female model extras, robot-on-human violence, and brutal robot violence.  For fans of the original Transformers cartoon series, it was shocking to see so many humans running for their lives only to be exploded into debris, falling to their deaths, or crushed by the Decepticons.  Many of the Autobots and Decepticons also mean gruesome deaths by being shot multiple times while lying on the ground, disarmed (literally), decapitated (frequently), and torn apart (for minor hench-robots).  It was also difficult at times to distinguish which sides the robots were on, since they don't have the old-school Autobot or Decepticon logos on their chests.  I could not understand the motives behind the Director of National Intelligence woman nor the official who ends up in a wheelchair, because they seemed to only lead to cost taxpayers billions of dollars without any repercussions.  It also seemed illogical to me that military squads who knew they were going up against an army of evil robots would bring assault rifles with bullets that bounced off their targets (unless scoring an eye-penetrating headshot), and only one anti-tank rocket.",1386374400,,1253,5.245
4316154,5,B004BDOEZO,"This 3rd installment absolutely, positively was the best of all! The plot was beyond those of the first 2, and it was a thrill to watch!

4316166,1,B004BDOEZO,"The same tradition of immaturity from Revenge of the Fallen continues. The action scenes are so busy they are a chore to watch. The jokes fall flat. The actors, voice and live-action alike, are doing a good job. Unfortunately, the script they are reciting is awful.

Spoilers ahead.

Decepticons are hiding in a predictable location given the name of the movie, and they want to enslave Earth. To accomplish this, their plan is to teleport their home world nearby. The original leader of the Autobots is convinced this is a good thing.

Ironhide dies unnecessarily. Optimus Prime achieves peace by killing without mercy. Although humans win the day with some robot help, the ending is not satisfactory.

Sentinel's betrayal is clumsy. Shockwave is boring, and his overgrown drill bit gets entirely too much screen time. It is disappointing when Starscream dies. Mr. Gould is an unnecessary human bad guy that doesn't get zapped soon enough. The injured Megatron is still strong enough to knock out the elder Prime, yet manages to get killed by a one-armed Optimus.

So much for a satisfying end to the series. Maybe Age of Extinction will be better. Transformers: The Movie from 1986 certainly was.",1384473600,,1198,4.97

It also features fine performances by Frances McDormand, John Turturro, and John Malkovich, all of whom seem to rise above the shoddy script.  For what it's worth, this is probably the best Transformers movie, but that is like being the tallest dwarf.  At least this one doesn't have the jive-bots or robo-testicles like its predecessor.",1383350400,,534,4.846153846153846

The only major detractor is Shia Lebouf. Seeing this in 3D was very awesome. The regular dialogue scenes have okay depth because they are post converted but the CGI is where the 3D really pops.

It only dragged towards the end during the big fight scene.  It did not have to be that long, but that's what you want in a Transformer movie - a huge fight scene. I loved that it was in Chicago though as it's my home town, great shots of destruction downtown.

You just need a bunch of rockets and fighter jets and go for it.  The story line is bad, the sob crybaby of a brother that chucks up his job because he loses his brother is just dumb, than as always he is convinced to re-enter the fight is laughable.  Not worth the money even if they reduce the price.  Watch it on TV with friends to have a good laugh.

The CGI was really nice, but the acting would appeal more to young children, while the violence is a bit more than that age group should be watching in a casual setting.

I was not too happy that Sam would scream at the top of his lungs every five-minutes, either. The whole tough-guy routine and his personal connection with the whole race of transforming robots is paraded around in such abundance that it's almost embarrassing to watch.

I recommend ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" for those who have seen the first two, and are afflicted with the compulsion to watch this one as well, because it's part of ""the set.""",1382400000,,876,4.573248407643312

4316198,2,B004BDOEZO,"Watch the trailers for Transformers: Dark of the Moon and tell me they don't send shivers up your spine.  Clearly there were some extraordinarily talented people working on the film. Unfortunately they all appeared to be in the special effects department and that's perhaps the saddest thing about the end result. This could have been a great film but the writing isn't just bad it's spectacularly bad. It's as if it were written by a twelve year old boy giggling in the back row of math class. Early in the movie Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is standing at the White House when a woman walks over, looks down below Whiteley's beltline and says. `Nice Box'. The obvious joke being that the woman is literally commenting on a nice looking box and with that all the dignity of the film flies right out the window. (In the movies defense the dignity had already been stripped away long before that joke)

So here I sit at my computer thumbing my nose at a movie that grossed over a billion dollars. This review will be lucky if it gets read by five people but this movie tasks me to write. It's like Michael Bay produced the movie just to screw with people. The film starts with the ever popular Shia LeBeouf and his new girlfriend. Oh, and a couple of horny gremlin looking little Autobots. Yeah, that's what I think about when I think Transformers. The focus of the movie is all on Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky because fans just can never get enough LeBeouf. We see him trying to get a job. We see him working at his new job. We see him interacting with his idiotic, unfunny parents. Pure comedy gold every second.  There are all sorts of other characters that are written as if the writers were aliens whose only experience with humans was to watch them from a distant planet. Between all this filler and garbage is just about the most awesome fighting robot action ever put on film.

The special effects action are why the film grossed over a billion dollars but the writing is why the film will never stand the test of time because special effects become dated very quickly. The special effects in the 1977 Superman movie were junk compared to the 2013 movie but it still holds up because of the writing. Movies like Robocop, Bladerunner and Predator stand the test of time because the scripts were great or at the very least not terrible.  You could probably get full enjoyment out of Dark of the Moon just watching the good parts on YouTube. I've seen the scene from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen where Devastator transforms and then climbs to the top of a pyramid and it looks INCREDIBLE but I don't really need to see the movie because I've seen the cool parts and I've heard it's even worse than this one.  The special effects here aren't uniformly good and scenes where Shia LeBeouf is fully CGI are pretty bad. The scene from the trailer where a giant Decepticon is crushing a building is cool but what you don't see are the parts where the people inside slide around in the collapsing building like something out of a cartoon.

This is not even nearly the worst movie I have ever seen but to spend so much money and create such amazing visuals and then create such pitiful writing. Apparently people don't care because the movie raked in money like Scrooge McDuck filling his money bin. I was hoping to see something similar to the aforementioned Devastator scene but the big robot in this film is actually Shockwave who seems to control this giant tentacle looking robot and it just didn't compare to Devastator. There is some cool stuff but with almost no focus on character building as pertains to the Transformers themselves they tend to just look like nearly indistinguishable piles of junk when in robot form bashing into each other. I also wasn't real thrilled with the attempt to tie into actual historical events like the moon landing and the Chernobyl disaster seemed ill advised bordering on offensive. When THE Buzz Aldrin shows up to say that, yeah, they went to the moon to investigate a crashed alien spacecraft it felt like abuse of the elderly. I didn't hate this movie but I wouldn't ever pay to see it nor do I have any interest in owning it. All the good stuff is on YouTube and you can watch it in about 10 minutes.",1381968000,13,4274,4.5863874345549736

It was hard for the fourteen year old to watch for the fact of the strong language and sexual content. So, if you tire of listening to the f-bomb you might just want to utilize the ""MUTE"" option.

I think that it was unfortunate that the producers felt they need to rely on elevating the rating level with this content to sell the product.

Otherwise, the FX is outstanding as in previous, and the main storyline stands with the ideals of Transformers.",1381190400,2,555,4.595959595959596

4316227,4,B004BDOEZO,"I was very impressed with this film. Michael Bay, the director, was able to handle considerable visual complexity and technology and weave a vast amount of  visual stimuli into a comprehensible narrative with very clearly defined forces of good and evil.  There are several ideas that were generated for me as I watched. For example, as film making technology is able to produce increasingly realistic yet fantastic images does the story narrative have to take a more concrete and simple morality play structure so as not to overwhelm the viewer. The basic story narrative here is that a young man must struggle to gain and maintain the affection of the damsel in distress while his loyalty to others maintains a social bond that allows for heroic, world saving actions. In other words there are clear cut good guys and bad guys and this remains pretty clear so that the visual complexity does not overwhelm the viewer. The exact opposite of this would be a film based on a Jane Austen novel (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma ) where characters are multifaceted and interact in a world of relatively very little action but there are multiple layers of interpersonal nuance.

Yet the world of good and evil in Transformers: Dark of the Moon is made more interesting by humor, sexuality, and the tricks that the forces of good and evil both use to gain the upper hand. In fact it is this process of combatants using wit, strength, subterfuge, alliance, confusion, and trickery which makes up much of the action and extends the narrative. When watching boxing, we see two forces pounding each other and we watch for those strategic moves that will allow one of these forceful men to gain some advantage over the other. This film is very much in that line of thinking for the warring forces continually escalates their bombardment of each other yet for at least a 20 minute segment of the film the underdog uses wit to counteract the forces of evil that may appear at first to be insurmountable.

The acting is delightful, much like a situation comedy. Even in the most frightful scenes the primary actors keep a cool Mona Lisa smirk on their faces. I have seen the Three Stooges look more distressed than the primary actors in this film. But don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing, it just means that the story narrative including the vast perils faced by the characters are all part of world view in which the good guys always win.

Maybe I am a kid at heart but every time one of the transformers changes from an automobile to a robotic monster my eyes jumped out of my head. I was transfixed as if seeing a miracle and questioned what part of the automobile became what part of the robotic creature. The premise that there might be alien creatures that are able to inhabit our computers, washing machines, blenders, and motorcycles and at will converting them into robotic gladiators was fascinating. The film is certainly worth viewing.",1380585600,5,2958,4.724806201550388
4316228,3,B004BDOEZO,Story seemed to drag.  Shia Labeouf character should be more mature by this point.... still too juvenile and therefore not believable.,1380412800,,134,5.380952380952381

Why the heck did they wait 50 years to do anything?  Who shot down Sentenial?  Just plot hole after plot hole.  In fact that is where this movie belongs, in a deep hole, like the Laurentian Abyss, where the deactivated decepticons ended up in the last movie.  Which brings up another hole- The decepticons seemed to take damage from standard human weapons, which means the decepticons could have been scrapped for their metal content.  Also, who brought Megatron back to life?  Could that be done with Sentinal?",1380326400,,650,4.732142857142857

I really shouldn't need more words, because that sums it up, but Mr. Bay has actually sunk below the level of his previous Transformers movies.  He started with promising materials, because transforming robots, and then draggd it all through a mud-puddle of not-caring-if-it-makes-sense.

4316234,5,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers: Dark of the moon has a lot to live up to with the past two Transformer movies that have proceeded it, setting the baseline. This Transformer movie was by far the best of the three. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was a movie filled with Beautiful cars, eye-popping explosions, and twists and turns, coming from the amazing visions of Michael Bay.
 Michael Bay was the mastermind to the previous two movies of this trilogy and has done it again here. Michael Bay has been nominated for countless awards winning handfuls of them. He has found a way to make grown men smile in excitement, and children wide-eyed in amazement seeing the transforming toy vehicles from their childhoods, become their real-life Decepticon killers and earth protectors.
In this third part of the trilogy, Optimus has become aware that there is a ship from his fellow Prime, Centinal, on the Earth's moon that landed years ago. As the reason for the human expedition to the moon reveals its true motivations and findings, the Decepticons appear with a full arsenal ready to take over the city of Chicago. It is up to the humans to work together with the Autobots to save the city they love and not become the slaves of the Decepticons.
Michael Bay is working with a very historic name, Transformers, and made sure that he didn't stretch the story and ability of these steel robots to far to ruin the image. Michael Bay finds a way to keep these 32 foot tall robots realistic, which is not a small fete. He keeps the characters in this third edition of this trilogy exactly how they would be in the comics. That's what makes this movie so great. Mr. Bay doesn't try to make the movie something it isn't, he doesn't try to expand the Transformer's comic line to fit him, he fits the Transformers.
A lot of action packed movies go too far with their special effects that it leaves the viewers laughing because of the unrealistic explosions that some directors add to their movies but, not here. Bay has always been known to use just enough to get the idea across and to make sure he doesn't get his audience saying ""that's so fake.""  Compared to others, Michael Bay films all his own explosion and stunts; nothing is computerized. This is what makes his special effects so perfect. They are all real.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is well worth the time; there will not be one ounce of the viewer that even thinks about regretting this movie choice. Haven't seen the two previous movies? Don't worry, jump right into this third movie and not even miss a beat. Enjoy the Beautiful cars, eye-popping explosion, and twists and turns that Michael Bay has in store.",1379980800,,2646,4.663811563169165
4316235,2,B004BDOEZO,"This is one of those films that is fun enough to watch, but pretty badly plotted and acted.
Sometimes, there is so much going on, on-screen that it looks like someone has thrown a bunch of old gears and car parts on the screen and just shook them around. One thing that you can say is that it's something of an assault on the senses!
However, it's also a pretty rubbish story, the actors seem to understand that they are in a not very good film and it just loses it's fun because of that.
Maybe one to keep the kids happy?

That said,  in the original Transformers, Optimus Prime was always unshakably true and just.  The standard archetypal father figure that would not waiver.  However at the end of this movie,  I'll be it not easy to understand in all the noise.  Megatron asks Prime for a truce and then Prime promptly kills him.  Then proceeds to execute a wounded character begging for his life.  This is pretty dark for a Transformers story line.  Death and dismemberment of humans and robots aside in this movie (collateral damage you'd expect to see).  The standard ending is to capture the bad guys and in the next episode the bad guys escape.  Prime would have stood justified over his defeated enemy and that would have been the end of it.  And to clarify I like dark movies and good guys turned bad films. But, this just doesn't do a childhood hero right.  Doesn't matter, I suppose this will be the end of Transformers anyway.",1379894400,,1085,4.6421052631578945

4316259,2,B004BDOEZO,"Still not very impressed w/ the Transformers movies, although I am a massive fan of the Cartoon

- Action scenes are too convoluted and close-up to truly appreciate the size of the Robots
- The complexity of the Robots' body structure is again far too convoluted.
  They look more like heaps of electrical garbage than sophisticated machines
- Also, the correlation of the Robot form to the Vehicular form it masks, is just not believable/convincing.
  e.g. Optimus Prime appears to be at least 2-3 times as tall and body-dense as the Cab of any Semi should/could be.
- Acting is absolutely terrible
- Scripts are pretty much Rubbish!

I think it all went wrong when the writers/producers/directors decided to make these movies from a Human's perspective!
The ridiculously mushy storylines surrounding the Autobots and Decepticons just does not fit with the overall motif.

They should try a storyline that involves little to no Humans at all (i.e. Robots to Robots) more in line w/ the Cartoon series and shoot it as such - from the perspective of Robots and not Humans.

I suggest they go back to the roots of the Robots/Story/Cartoon and work their way forward all over again!

The Transformers - Prime, Bumble Bee, etc., embody the moral conscience of the society your children will hopefully grow up in.

Comic books, especially Marvel, are good at taking the simple truth that good MUST triumph over evil... and the reasons why.

I see the attempt to give facial expressions to the Transformers, but it just doesn't come off as clean.  Decent story, started off good with the whole Apollo 11 cover-up, but quickly devolved into nothingness.  Very disappointed with the Shockwave treatment too.  Not sure what the heck that pet digger-worm-whatsits was supposed to be...

Shia LeBeouf was over the top as well, and kind of annoying.  Sorry to see Patrick Dempsey in this one, really like him as an actor, and he typically makes good decisions, this wasn't a necessarily bad one, but I can't believe he didn't have other (better) offers.

I did like the fact that Megatron (along with Sentinel Prime) were killed off.  Here's to hoping that the next movie will be a reboot.",1378425600,2,911,4.751592356687898

I'm too old to have played with the toys and hadn't seen the previous movies. Maybe they explained the unique characteristics of this universe before.

The girl was pretty but not super pretty and kind of an idiot. The guy was handsome but still a lame loser.

Horrible movie, even for a blockbuster. Don't even try it! Really! I mean it!",1376006400,,135,5.181818181818182
4316398,5,B004BDOEZO,"A twist and Turn movie that will have you squirming fro more!  3D is AMAZING ad well as the art and backdrops.  I loved the story line and most of all the PRIEST who in the end proves the ""GOOD WILL WIN OVER EVIL""",1376006400,,213,3.8181818181818183
4316399,5,B004BDOEZO,I bought this movie for myself for Christmas.  I thought it was the best of the Transformers movie.  The action was unbelievable and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was terrific and a must-see.,1375920000,,197,4.27027027027027
4316400,3,B004BDOEZO,More of the same. Shia Lebouf n a hot chick. Not Megan Fox though. Guess she got to much attention for Shia to handle. Too long and plot seemed a little strange to me. Ok though.,1375747200,,178,3.9722222222222223
4316401,5,B004BDOEZO,A great investment to your 3D library!  Great picture quality.  Includes the DVD version. I would highly recommend this movie.,1375747200,,126,5.25

4316403,4,B004BDOEZO,the fight scenes were epic and i love the intro with all the stuff going on its so well done you think they are real,1375660800,,116,3.68
4316404,3,B004BDOEZO,Very good addition to the Transformer series.  I would recommend this to transformer fans.  Leaves room in the end for perhaps another movie.,1375660800,,141,5.086956521739131
4316405,2,B004BDOEZO,The story line was so so but I thought the acting was overall bad and many characters mis  cast especially the lead male role.,1375574400,,126,4.25
4316406,5,B004BDOEZO,"Slick and badass is a good way to describe the movie. If you have seen the other two movies, you know what to expect: impressive special effects, lots of action, lots of battles with Autobots and Decepticons and much more. The movie didn't letdown in any category.",1375574400,,264,4.638297872340425
4316417,5,B004BDOEZO,The price for this dvd are higher at the Box stores. You can beat the price Shia Labeouf has. Transformer Fan,1375488000,,109,4.238095238095238

4316419,4,B004BDOEZO,"I thought this one was way better than Revenge of the Fallen which was utter GARBAGE. I thought the final battle at the end was really weak though, Optimus takes down everyone and they offer no resistance. The first Transformers movie is still the best one.",1375401600,,257,4.608695652173913
4316420,5,B004BDOEZO,great movie but miss his first girlfriend.  other than that it was awesome plenty of action and just a plain great movie,1375401600,,120,4.454545454545454

4316422,3,B004BDOEZO,"The story line was okay. However, action with an okay plot, to me, is worth three stars. That's my two cents.",1375315200,,109,4.238095238095238
4316423,5,B004BDOEZO,FULL OF ACTION .. WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN .. I HAVE SEEN ALL PARTS OF THE TRANSFORMERS MOVIES,1375315200,,98,3.95
4316424,5,B004BDOEZO,"If you liked the first Transformers movies then I feel you will enjoy Dark Of The Moon. They continue to fallow the story lines from the other movies. But, you see I like this type of movie, others may not. But this movie has it all for a guy. Pretty girls, fast cars & some slow one's too, big steel auto bots who like to tear up things and then blow up what ever they want wow, great stuff thank-U",1375315200,,399,4.0
4316425,5,B004BDOEZO,It's the last time you will see Megan Fox looking hot and sexy. Plus it has cars that turn into fighting robots. Every kids dream.,1375228800,,130,4.24

It is unfortunate to see the trend in some movies.",1375056000,4,121,4.083333333333333
4316450,5,B004BDOEZO,I got this for a Xmas gift a year or 2 ago.  I enjoyed this movie and would love to get the third.  The price was great and delivery was excellent.,1375056000,,147,3.7096774193548385

4316478,5,B004BDOEZO,"This movie was the best of the trilogy. Most movies get weaker as the saga continues but with Dark of the Moon it was the best thus far. You never know what is going to happen next and you are always on your toes. It's a movie that you would repeat because there is something you probably didn't catch the first time. Love, Love, Love!",1374710400,,335,4.1692307692307695
4316479,3,B004BDOEZO,It's an okay movie. The Sam story was pretty weak and the only parts I really liked was the Transformers parts. The movie was very simple and that was its hubris.,1374624000,,162,4.258064516129032
4316480,5,B004BDOEZO,"The movie is great. The action looks great in Blu Ray, but add 3D, Wow is the word. I recommend the 3D movie.",1374537600,,109,3.782608695652174
4316481,5,B004BDOEZO,Action packed. Left me on the edge of my seat at one point. Movie was a little on the silly side in the beginning but totally picked up the action just right. What a plot.,1374451200,,171,3.914285714285714
4316482,4,B004BDOEZO,"I like the way they integrated the transformer story line into real history, The special effects (visual and sonic) were impactful. Well done.",1374451200,,142,5.217391304347826
4316483,3,B004BDOEZO,This movie is better than the second Transformers movie.  That doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot.  It was just ok to me.  Worth a rent if you want an action movie and there's not much else to watch.,1374364800,,201,4.2368421052631575

4316485,3,B004BDOEZO,"The movie itself was a disappointment.  I didn't like that Megan Fox was fired, I didn't like the lack of closure on her character.  I also wasn't thrilled with the new girlfriend already in place, and Sam was like a caricature of himself.  It was all just a little over the top for me.  I bought it because I have the other ones, and I wanted a complete collection.  Upside, again, is that this inexpensive version is nice for people who just want the movie itself.",1374192000,,466,4.372093023255814

4316497,3,B004BDOEZO,Good action along the lines of Transformers movies.  The fact that the female costar was scantily dressed is simply unnecessary to making this a better film.,1374105600,,157,5.038461538461538

Will watch again Love it",1374105600,,120,4.761904761904762
4316499,2,B004BDOEZO,"Michael,

You made a number of movies in the 90's and 2000's that I loved. They are still movies I like to watch when they come on TV. Pearl Harbor introduced me to Kate Beckinsale and I thank you for that. However it is now time for you to either learn a completely different formula for filming a movie or else stop directing altogether. No more slo-mo shots. No more shots from the ground looking up at the hero as he surveys the chaos around him in a critical moment where everything seems almost lost. No more 'unnecessary to the plot' love stories with gratuitous shots of the scantily clad female love interest. It's all so dated now and that is no longer working. Your best work in the past few years was that short you did on South Park - I loved that and watch that regularly so please do more of that.

The only awesome thing about this movie: Optimus Prime! Peter Cullen is perfect as always as the voice of Optimus. He is to Optimus what Kevin Conroy is to Batman: the one and only true voice of the character.",1374105600,,1023,4.295336787564767
4316500,4,B004BDOEZO,"Lots of action...similar to all the other Transformer movies.  Good CGI...nicely done.  Recommended, if you like this type of movie.",1374105600,,132,5.55

4316502,3,B004BDOEZO,i enjoyed the previous two versions better.  Dark of The Moon lacked a credible plot and the acting was flat relying on the special effects to make it through the movie.  I miss Magan Fox.,1374019200,,188,4.3428571428571425
4316503,4,B004BDOEZO,"Great film but kinda makes the second one's story not make sense.  For instance,  how would megatron know that optimus would have the matrix to restart sentinel?",1373932800,,161,4.925925925925926

4316517,5,B004BDOEZO,I received this movie in record time and I have not had any viewing issues with the picture or frame freezing.

4316519,4,B004BDOEZO,Movie could have been better but the quality on Amazon Prime rivals Bluray. Worth a look if your a fan of the series.,1373760000,,117,4.130434782608695

I regret not going to see this on the big screen.  What a good story it was, and AMAZING action!  When Optimus defeats those 2 bad a$$ bad guys with one arm at the end of the film I was in awe.  Of course I would have loved to see Megan Fox in the story, but the new girl is hot as well.",1373500800,,457,3.622448979591837

 Hey anybody would love this movie and I recommend it to anyone for renting or buying its really good.

I obliged, because I was tired and needed to take a nap.

4316724,4,B004BDOEZO,"Ok let's be honest, most action/adventure movies will never be nominated for (let alone win) the top Oscars. There are always a few exceptions (Heath Ledger, LOTR, etc) but they are few. I don't watch action movies with the idea that they will move me, if anything the trailers of most movies give so much away I usually have an idea of what's going to happen and how it will end. That being said I saw Dark of the Moon at the theater and enjoyed it enough to buy the blu ray. I have to say that it was on par with my expectation of Michael Bay movies: loud, action packed, and lots of explosions. I grew up watching the cartoon so perhaps my view is slightly skewed as I was stoked to see one of my favorite shows brought to life. I didn't care for the 2nd one and I thought the 3rd one was an improvement. Yes Shia LaBeouf is over the top and screaming frequently and Peter Cullen comes off pontificating whenever he speaks, but it's still a good popcorn movie.

The video was crisp and clear, the audio sounded excellent through my dated home theater system

One thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of special features. I missed that it was only available for the 3D version, so that was irritating. I've seen my share of movies in 3D and I don't personally see the need to own a 3D TV so I'm not wasting money on a 3D version of a movie.",1369008000,,1346,4.213178294573644

4316726,3,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers-Dark of the Moon(released June/11)stars,among others,Shia LaBeouf,Josh Duhamel,John Turturro,Tyrese Gibson,John Malkovich and Frances McDormand. With the voice talents of Steve Buscemi and every one's favourite Vulcan,Leonard Nimoy. This is a definite return to the good side of things,like night and day compared to film#2 in this franchise. This film however I found takes a rather more somber tone throughout than the first one. The first one had all the boffo elements in a magical combination that propelled it through the roof,while this one is much shorter on humour and heavier and longer on the action.
The story finds us going back to the early 60s and a lunar event detected by NASA.Something crashed on the moon and the crux is who will get there to investigate first,the U.S.or the Russians ? This supposedly is the premise behind Kennedy's admonition to go to the moon in /69. When Apollo 11 lands Armstrong and Aldrin are seen investigating the crash site and bringing back five devices and one round piece of alien technology.
Fast forward to today and Shia Lebouf has a hot new girlfriend but is out of work. Two small bots live with him. The autobots have been working closely with the U.S.military and on a trip to Chernobyl they recover the same round piece of technology that NASA found on the moon those many years before. Optimus Prime is mad because of the deception this has been to them. It is revealed only a handful of people knew about the mission,let alone the piece they found. Prime and others head to the moon and find the crashed ship,the Ark. They recover its pilot,Sentinel Prime,the leader of the entire Cybertron world before it' demise many years before.
Back on earth in a secret area Sentinel is brought back to life by Optimus. Sentinel now assumes Optimus's duties as leader. However it seems a deal was secretly struck between Sentinel and the Decepticons/Megatron years before. While the U.S.military only had five alien devices,the Decepticons already had hundreds of them they recovered ahead of Apollo 11. They were actually space bridges,which when powered around the world,would bring the home world of the Transformers into a close orbit around the earth. Sentinel plays along with Optimus until the time is right,then betrays him. Optimus and the rest of the good Autobots are forced to leave earth,which leaves it defenseless. This gives the Decepticons their chance to get their home world back and rule earth.
The space bridges are placed around the world and the center of it all is in Chicago. From here the Decepticons start their rampage. However they don't count on the return of Optimus,whose moves were designed to lull the Decepticons into a false sense of security. Just when they think they are on their way,Optimus and the boys slowly make their way into Chicago and start to take the Decepticons on full force. The star bridge beam is ultimately interrupted which destroys Cybertron. And in a twist,Megatron confronts Sentinel,as Megatron wants to be the only leader. He in fact kills Sentinel,who is in turn pounced on and killed by Optimus. The film ends as Optimus re swears the Autobots allegiance to the earth.
The ending and wrap up comes all too swiftly,just as we have endured an overly long and patience taxing fight between the earth forces,Autobots and the Decepticons in Chicago. It is as if they realized they were into overtime and had to get it over quickly. As I have mentioned there is a decided lack of humour in this one compared to the first film. Director Bay seems to have wanted to concentrate on battles and the more serious side of things. But along with this comes too many slow spots/overly detailed story segments. However the photography is very well done as is the S/FX.Watch for a surprise appearance by Buzz Aldrin,the second man to set foot on the moon.
Technically speaking,the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all,while totally fumbling the ball in film#2,Bay has recovered nicely and come back with a film more worthy of the Transformers name. However it's over attention to plot detail,the overly long Chicago battle,super swift ending,and its over the top run time of just over 150 minutes make it an uneven and seat wiggling entry. It is a giant leap from the last and one hopes he can mix up a newer one with more of the spine tingling elements from his very first concoction. 3- 3 1/2 stars.",1368921600,,4464,4.851900393184797

Since seeing Michael Bay's First Transformers movie, I always felt the mechanical detail, complexity, and Texture of the Transformer Robots were Lost in the fast-paced quick-scene-cutting action shots.  As much as I love the HD detailing of the CGI, the aforementioned action shots caused a lot of visual confusion - it was very difficult to follow the action at times - a lot of detail was moving around very quickly.  I am Very Happy to report that HD 3D is a Great Improvement for the Transformers franchise and for viewing this type of CGI imaging!

Unlike some movies that might be so over the top and basement-budgeted that they turn out to be accidentally good, T:dotm is over-produced, under acted, and has such painfully bad dialog and plot elements that it is truly unwatchable.

I had to stop after an hour due to concern that I might tear an ocular membrane because of excessive eye-rolling.

I won't even list the ridiculously bad basic science (but just two things, please: there is no permanently dark side of the moon; it rotates once a month since it's tidally locked to its earth orbit.  Also, an out of control, damaged space ship from another star system is unlikely in the extreme to happen to collide with anything, ever, let alone a satellite of a populated planet.  Darn, I said only two... Ok).

The transformers themselves are reasonably well rendered cgi, but are usually of no discernible purpose.  Their dialog is infantile or
otherwise pointless.  The 'minor' transformer characters, including the decepticons, exist to provide throw-away lines intended to amuse the audience with their innuendo and whatnot.  It just hurts.

...and I *enjoy* dumb, frivolous movies!  They just need to make even a little bit of sense.  Just a little...",1368144000,5,1347,4.959821428571429

4316754,3,B004BDOEZO,"I was under the impression that Michael Bay insisted there wouldn't be any ""dorky comedy"" in this installment.  Nor would there be any slaphappy robots given to crude jokes and slapstick pratfalls.  Kindly explain then the two jokey minuscule bots who adamantly protest that they are ""not pets or toys.""  Bay also introduced John Malkovich as a pompous one-joke idiot who goes berserk over the color red.  What was Ken Jeong's (Jerry Deep Wang) performance all about if not just a rambunctious mess of dorky humor?  Also returning as the butts of all the jokes, Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam Witwicky's dopey parents (bought in just to provide dumb jokes only to abruptly disappear once their shtick was delivered).  Bay even brought in Bill O'Reilly solely as a joke.  And by now, what is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) but a bad joke?  Shrill, pouty, and more fidgety than Don Knotts on an off day, Sam has become an obnoxious twit who acts as though he'd like to be anywhere but there, forced to perform all that abrasive comedy.
Exactly what did Michael Bay improve in this installment?  He reinvented history, kept the usual number of explosions, the usual number of chase sequences, the vast array of bots (few distinguishable from their counterparts), replaced the officious dolt from the last movie with Frances McDormand playing what ostensibly is the same character doing the same tired, I'm taking over spiel, that the last two actors gave in the last two films!  What is this if not filmmaking by the numbers!?  There wasn't a new script just cut and paste elements meant to convey the same things repeatedly.  No fresh ideas, a foregone conclusion, and a daffy non-romantic romance with a new babe (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who is clearly more of a friend who's a girl than a girlfriend.  I don't even want to talk about Patrick Dempsey.
Okay, yes, sure, Bay finally showed bodies and the killing of people, something he went to great lengths to avoid in the first two films.  But as presented here, in this plot, who were the Decepticons going to use for slave labor if they were killing all the people they could get their hands on!?

And now they say there's going to be a fourth installment, sans Witwicky LaBeouf.  This begs the question, why keep remaking the same film?  If Bay hasn't gotten it right thus far, he's never going to get it right.",1368057600,9,2367,4.734146341463415

I love the old cartoons from the 80's.. they were easy to recognize.. but i can't tell starscream from ironhide.. from megatron.. it's just all a pile of metal flying everywhere and no focus on any of their personalities.. and too much human-focus.

I yawned the entire time through this movie and really pushed myself to finish it.

It's like they try too hard that they lose the viewer..  much like a comedian that tries too hard to be funny isn't funny.

It's hard for me to identify or recognize the transformers.. and the most unlikely things happen over and over and over that it causes a disconnect..

The movie is garbage.. and only mildly entertaining just to see a bit of flash..  But I come to this movie, not as a transformers fan.. but as someone that wants to see some mindless action.

and I walk away from it thinking how much better of a job I could have done with the franchise if I were in the director's seat.

4316832,3,B004BDOEZO,"It is no wonder that many people believe that the moon landings were a hoax after seeing the opening sequence of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  The film opens with an alternate 1960s where NASA discovers a crash on the dark side of the moon which launched the American space program.  A montage follows that utilizes historical look alikes of John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon and others fused with historical footage.  In the end Apollo 11 discovers a wrecked Autobot spaceship on the moon and a number of cylinders that act as a space bridge.
In the present Sam Witwicky (played by the always lackluster Shia LaBeouf) struggles to find employment after arguably saved the world two times.  After receiving a medal from a Barack Obama look alike he meets Carly Spencer, an intern with the British embassy, and  the two hit it off.  Meanwhile, Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is working with the Autobots, the freedom fighters exiled from Cybertron, to keep the Deceptions, the archenemies of the Autobots, and other earth evils at bay.  During a trip to Chernobyl it is discovered that humanity had not informed the Autobots of all they knew regarding their race.  Interestingly Gary and other Northwest Indiana sites were used to film the Chernobyl scenes (what does that say about Gary and the state of affairs in Indiana?)
This leads to an Autobot trip to the moon where they discover the space bridge and the long lost Autobot leader, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy).  The rest will be left spoiler free.
Witwicky's new arm candy, Carly Spencer (Victoria Secret model and industry newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), replaces Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox who was fired after making a statement about Hitler in reference to director Michael Bay's work ethic).  This replacement was given just a slight mention in the film.  However, Huntington-Whiteley's performance is hardly Oscar worthy and not just because she is an inexperienced actress.
It is clear from the beginning of the film that she is not supposed to be anything other than a set piece rather than a real contributor to the events.  This is especially noticeable during a scene of excessive action where the camera slows down for what feels like five minutes with her in the foreground walking towards the audience.  Perhaps I'm a Transformers traditionalist but no human on earth would add to the experience.
The real reason to see the film isn't the plot that contains more holes than Swiss cheese or the new lady; it is the giant robots battling each other.  On that note the special effects are always top notch as it is a Michael Bay film.  While the effects are often too fast and up close to truly appreciate outside of an IMAX experience, they were good nonetheless.
Linkin Park's traditional Transformers song is uncharacteristically slow and rather unnoticeable.  The audio effects often overshadow whatever soundtrack song is trying to set the mood.  This is rather unfortunate as it is probably the best Transformers soundtrack so far.
Overall the movie is just decent.  If this was a tale told without giant robots fighting each other it probably wouldn't even garner the score it did.  The story doesn't make any sense and the human characters are forgettable.  It is Optimus Prime, Megatron and company that make this film worthwhile.",1366588800,2,3329,4.953237410071942

4316834,1,B004BDOEZO,"Michael Bay proves yet again that special effects and explosions cannot make a moving film.  The Decepticons vs. Autobots is a black and white dichotomy that was ineffectual and uninspired.  The Decepticons are so 1 dimensional, that they cannot even reach victory without screwing it up with betrayal.  The Autobots get a quantum of better treatment, but, are just as 1 dimensional as the Decepticons.  Bay's treatment of women, and their subsequent comparison to automobiles is objectification at it's worst.  One shining feature, the robot battles are not super closeups of robot bodies filling the screen, making their combat indecipherable, but backed up, so one can understand that at least something is going on.

He tricks Optimus and company into a spaceship forcing the Autobots off the Earth and Shockwave proceeds to take over Chicago while Megatron takes over Washington DC to force the inhabitants to build a space bridge to bring Cybertron to Earth.

The story could have been done much better and the acting was phoned in.  The first movie was a great popcorn flick.  The second one you could see was just meant to capitalize on the success of the first one, which is often the case for sequels.  But usually if the second one does well enough, the third one is done well since they know it's unlikely that there will be more, at least from the same people.  This is a prime example of what happens when the only goal is to milk the franchise for money with no concern for the brand.  I'm not sure what I expected, just know that I was disappointed.

So wish they got rid of the Sam character early on and had another one fill in.  What better way to transition to a new character than Sam dying at  what seems like the end of the world and have another fighter step up and fill his shoes.

4316881,5,B004BDOEZO,My son who is seven was in love with the action packed movie. He wanted to purchase more of the Transformers movies. I even enjoyed watching it with hom.,1364947200,,153,4.310344827586207
4316882,4,B004BDOEZO,"Ok let's be honest, most action/adventure movies will never be nominated for (let alone win) the top Oscars. There are always a few exceptions (Heath Ledger, LOTR, etc) but they are few. I don't watch action movies with the idea that they will move me, if anything the trailers of most movies give so much away I usually have an idea of what's going to happen and how it will end. That being said I saw Dark of the Moon at the theater and enjoyed it enough to buy the blu ray.  I have to say that it was on par with my expectation of Michael Bay movies: loud, action packed, and lots of explosions.  I grew up watching the cartoon so perhaps my view is slightly skewed as I was stoked to see one of my favorite shows brought to life. I didn't care for the 2nd one and I thought the 3rd one was an improvement. Yes Shia LaBeouf is over the top and screaming frequently and Peter Cullen comes off pontificating whenever he speaks, but it's still a good popcorn movie.

The video was crisp and clear, the audio sounded excellent through my dated home theater system

One thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of special features.  I missed that it was only available for the 3D version, so that was irritating.  I've seen my share of movies in 3D and I don't personally see the need to own a 3D TV so I'm not wasting money on a 3D version of a movie.",1364860800,,1350,4.213178294573644

4316884,5,B004BDOEZO,Outstanding graphics and special affects.  Watched it via Amazon prime over a wireless connection in HD and the surround sound was great as well as the graphics and it never skipped or buffered once,1364688000,,198,4.823529411764706

4316903,3,B004BDOEZO,Like the intersection of the conspiracy mystique of the Kennedy period but I was really disappointed in the lack of transformer dialogue and transformation. Did they run out of money? It always seems like the human action is way longer than the transformer one and its hard to tell what took them so long to save them. Still tons of action.,1364256000,2,340,4.590163934426229

1. An incoherent mess of pictures and sounds.
2. Worse than reading the bible.
3. Possibly the worst movie ever.
4. I think the government used taxpayer money to make this film.
5. Nationalist message equating decepticons to terrorists and autobots as the heroic American military.

OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH MY SOURCES, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT MADE IT BETTER WAS SHIA LaBEOUF'S HOT NEW GIRLFRIEND. MEGAN WAS GOOD, BUT THIS ONE IS BETTER/HOTTER. THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THIS FLICK WAS THE GIRLFRIEND. I MEAN, AFTER YOU SEEN ONE TRANSFORMER KNOCK-DOWN-DRAG-OUT, YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL. ALSO, SHIA AND HIS STAGE PARENTS ARE FUN TO WATCH, AND I LOVE SHIA'S CHARACTER'S DEFIANCE OF CIVIL AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.

The action is looks better than in the second, wider shots allowing you to fully appreciate the massiveness of this machines but everything else just about sucks. Story wise there is a nice little pieces here and there but for the most part is to linear and simplistic that its quite predictable and boring. Honestly 3 stars is generous but mostly again because the action looks pretty good.",1363737600,2,558,4.88421052631579

4316933,2,B004BDOEZO,"I've enjoyed the previous two movies, this one though felt forced and disjointed. It was too focused on following the same formula of down and out hero with hot girlfriend. The storyline had potential, but it was almost like they tried to stick too much movie in too little time. There were times I had trouble even following the plot until I realized what the writers were attempting to portray. That's unusual for me.

If you just want explosions and hot chicks, good movie. If you are expecting something akin to the previous two, look elsewhere.",1363737600,,549,4.71875

I'm surprised it is not frequently counted among the best 3D depth and quality. The screen effects are jaw dropping! The story is intriguing too. All those people that blab about the poor quality of this movie possibly fueled by a personal vendetta with Michael Bay have a right to their opinion of course, but I dare them to present a movie they've directed and produced themselves before splashing their malicious and non professional reviews about this product of hard work and talent!

4317042,2,B004BDOEZO,"I wanted to like this movie but there were too many problems. I will say the action and CGI are top-notch, but it does take a while to get around to it and the final battle in particular goes so on so long you just want it to stop. The plot is somewhat clever and there's a good twist or two gien the premise of a robot smash-em-up flick, but that fact is trumped by other factors. The movie's biggest problem is that it tries to be more of a comedy than anything else, which does not work if 30 seconds prior to a joke you're filming people being literally obliterated by Decepticons. There's no fine-line being walked by Michael Bay there. Too much time is also wasted on Sam's relationship with his girlfriend who you wish would just stop talking and be the window dressing she's supposed to be. That said, the development of other characters is almost completely absent, whether we're talking about humans or transformers. This could have been a decent movie, but thanks to Bay's bombastic tendencies while trying to play cutesy, it actually winds up underwhelming us.",1361923200,,1072,4.588541666666667

4317050,4,B004BDOEZO,"The special effects on this movie were outstanding and the imagery was exceptional. They were so good, in fact, that they covered for the complete lack of writing. It almost seemed as if this movie was created as a series of 30 second bits intended solely to make good commercials.",1361836800,,281,4.64
4317051,1,B004BDOEZO,"Okay... for starters, I liked the first two Transformers movies; they're what got me BACK into Transformers. I know the second one had some serious flaws, but I enjoyed it for the mindless action Bay-film that it was.

Now, as I said, Michael Bay's movies got me back into Transformers. As a result, I watched some of the shows, did some research on characters and backstory, and played the High Moon Studios games. I made myself a die-hard Transformers fan, and when I saw MORE classic characters were going to be in THIS, Dark of the Moon, I was thrilled...

Then I saw it and ranted the next few days.

To sum up, pros and cons;

PROS:
*Apollo 11 references were cool
*The epic, tragic feel of the attack on Chicago and the havoc wrought on humanity
*Less of Bay's racial-based humor, though not entirely absent.

CONS (oh boy):
*Decepticons STILL suck; Megatron, Starscream and the other Decepticons can barely so much as scratch a HUMAN, let alone an Autobot. Very anti-climatic and a betrayal to their characters; Decepticons, especially Megatron, are supposed to be BAD-@$$. I was hoping they'd make Starscream and Megatron better, like in the first movie opposed to the second, but they just suck MORE.

*The new chick. I wasn't biased because I was a die-hard Megan Fox fan, but this new chick was pointless. She doesn't do ANYTHING to help other than irk a useless Megatron, and the first shot of her is her tush. Basically, Bay was like ""OH CRAP, our hot girl's gone, gotta get another- OH LOOK A VICTORIAN SECRET MODEL GET HER @$$ IN HERE!"" What the hell? I don't go to Transformers for the ditsy, useless hot chicks. Make her a strong character, at least Megan Fox helped FIGHT!

*Annoying, ""Original"" Transformers. Needed something to replace the racially insentive duo from the second one, didn't we?

*New villains. Shockwave was marketed as a major villain in this movie, but he has one line, does very little, and dies pathetically. Doesn't even get an actual fight, he just gets shot a bunch, stabbed and dies. Sentinel Prime, ANOTHER betrayal of the character Bay was basing him off, took Shockwave's spotlight and this was totally pointless.

*Not really a Transformers movie. Very few Autobot vs Decepticon fights. Most of it is just our Bay-glorified military flying in to save the day. I wouldn't have a problem with that if that's what I was EXPECTING, but this is FREAKING TRANSFORMERS!!!

Hate this movie, despite the few and far between good bits. Won't see Transformers 4, if there is one. The way Bay threw away Shockwave and other classic characters shows he doesn't care for their potential epic impact as he does their marketability. This movie showed me the kind of director Michael Bay is; an exploitative, money-grubbing director.",1361664000,3,2766,4.8042105263157895

4317053,1,B004BDOEZO,"It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior.  Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers.  I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better.  No, it wasn't.

1- The resolution of every single movie on there is so annoying. I hate how I'm only using 2 quarters of my 47 inch tv because the picture is cut from top and bottom. Don't tell me it's the tv settings, please. The only thing that fills up the screen is the ""zoom"" mode and no comment on that.
2- The ""amazon"" app on my smart tv (vizio) is ridiculous and needs tons of work. One of the issues that you only see a few movies that you can click on. You have to go to ""search"" to find the movie that you want to watch, other than that you'd think that they have no movies to offer at all.
3- There is no ""amazon instant video"" app for my samsung phone nor my samsung tablet. So amazon decided to provide thousands of other devices with this app (because I looked it up and saw the huge list that doesn't have neither my phone nor tablet) but chose not include the samsung devices. You can only find the app on the play store but it's ""not compatible with your device"" which made me really mad.

When the autobots said goodbye and walked into the shuttle, I felt tears prick my eyes - though I knew they would be back!
I will say though, that as part of the transformers movies go, it wasn't my favorite. And other than characters, there wasn't much to tie it to the past movies.

The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style.

4317222,2,B004BDOEZO,"Excellent CGI, awesome special effects, great machinery and sci-fi feel. Awesome robot-to-robot combat. Nice historical footage work.

Overall, terrible movie, due to inconsistencies, deus ex machina, plot holes all over the place, random things happening that have nothing to do with anything. This is really a ""B"" movie, like those B-movies that Mystery Science Theater 3000 rips on.

The plot is so thin an ant fart would rip it to shreds. Unfortunately, no ants farted at any point while I was watching two and a half hours of my life wander away from me in confusion.

Most entertaining human character: Jerry, the weird Asian.
Most entertaining robot: The little ones that you just wanna have as your own pet.

This movie uses the first hour to create an absolutely hopeless scenario that could have been a good set up for an awesome movie. I actually wondered if the Autobots could really save the day.

Instead, the movie used the last hour to rip off The Avengers. A portal ripping open the sky to another dimension to allow access to an alien homeworld? Large, whale-like ships floating around that are carriers for smaller craft?

If you liked the first film, don't watch this one. Just watch the Avengers again, or wait for Pacific Rim. Sorry Autobots.

If you want to just see things blow up, and watch robots fight each other, but without any other traditional movie elements such as reason, logic, acting, AND you watched all the videos on Youtube of rednecks and scientists and kids in their backyard blowing things up, and saw all the robots from MIT punching each other, then watch the film: Just don't tell anyone.",1358380800,,1633,4.810714285714286

4317236,5,B004BDOEZO,"Got a kick out of the tiny Decepticon Bots.  Really broke-up the fast-passed action with some good humor.

The only thing that drove me nuts, was the non-life like action of the human bodies being tossed about constantly for more then five minutes.  In real life, a quarter of a second of that much activity to the human body, and we'd be spaghetti noodles.  Drove me nuts waiting to see the bodies burst like zits.  Another thing, the robots were shown bleeding red fluids & slobbering while yelling.  Eh, not much of a fan of blood & guts, as it's not really needed to tell a story, and disallows the younger kids from watching and learning from the story lines.

Aside from this, gave it five stars as there are few good movies these days with a good plot line or lessons for the young to be learned.  Also, good unique humor.",1358208000,,829,4.407894736842105

The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?

There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.

The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things.

The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust).  The inept plot.  Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting.  Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels.  The endless stream of former A list actors showing up.  Etc.

With a good sound system (and I really do mean GOOD), the sound is ear-shattering and hugely enjoyable. On a small screen, (I found the same at my suburban cinema when I first saw this movie), there is so much going on and so much hardware moving so fast that it sometimes gets hard to distinguish the goodies from the baddies. I loved the steals from so many other movies, including (SPOILER ALERT), the Star Trek/Spock references, the various Alien and Predator looks of some of the Decepticons.

I am glad I always/usually watch the specials after the main movie because seeing and hearing how Michael Bay directs and how some of the actors prepare for a scene, I would have been a little put-off in some places. But the specials did show the extraordinary access they were given to areas of Detroit, Chicago and the NASA facilities. The behind-the-scenes stuff on the Blu-ray edition is comprehensive, extensive and impressive.

I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had.",1356739200,2,454,4.159090909090909

This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie.

4317371,3,B004BDOEZO,The only problem is when you replace the original cast it loses it`s basis. Not to mention what happened to the original girl. She should have been in it or at least showed a breakup. Otherwise a great film. Can you imagine Spock or bones being replaced? How about all those robots on Lost In Space and Star Wars being replaced? Or the princess being substituted for a sleep around slut?,1356393600,,387,4.464788732394366
4317372,1,B004BDOEZO,"Before getting into why this movies sucks i will first say this. I have seen all 3 movies in the series,the first was good although it focused more on story than action but it was i guess an introduction of the transformers for people that might not have watched the cartoon. Part 2 was in my opinion decent,there were things that i didn't really care for like the cornball comedy also Devastator what purpose did he serve? & Optimus Prime coming back to life and not only damaging Megatron but also defeating The Fallen so quickly,it seemed to me that the ending was rushed..Now on to this piece of crap,the reason why this film sucks is because it focuses more on the human element than it does on the actual robots. I also think that some of the actors in the film served absolutely no purpose in it except for making it longer and more tedious to watch. The special effects in certain parts particularly towards the end look downright clunky. I found the part where the soldiers are either flying or glding through the air hard to swallow as well and since when do transformers get taken out by humans? Sam taking out Starscream at the end of the film pissed me off! Cmon man if Starscream had to die at least let him get taken out by an Autobot not a puny human..I think Michael Bay or whoever the hell directs the next one (Really? another one as bad as this one was?)Needs to take this in a different direction because to me this series of films just keeps getting worse.",1356307200,,1478,4.417582417582418
4317373,5,B004BDOEZO,"Just when you think they could not top themselves, they bring in Leonard Nimoy to voice Sentinel Prime, Optimus' predecessor.  The CGI on this movie is so fantastic it feels real!  Michael Bay really has the feel for how they Transformers' need to act, and their interactions with the Human Race.  Hugo Weaving is perfect as Megatron in all 3 movies as well.  And it was nice to hear Peter Cullen return from the G1 series as the voice of Optimus.",1356307200,,447,4.481481481481482

4317395,1,B004BDOEZO,"This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.",1355875200,2,750,4.481751824817518

4317411,5,B004BDOEZO,"Beyond the in-depth film analysis that you can find elsewhere, it should be noted to any and all considering adding this 3D bluray to their stereoscopic collection that the 3D is just outstanding. Michael Bay and the Paramount execs decided to film this flick in native 3D and what a great decision that was. The first scene depicting the autobots fleeing Cybertron is an absolute 3D spectacle in its own right (granted entirely CGI). The depth contrast between the highly detailed Cybertron and the ships that surround it was a feast for the eyes. Another scene that comes to mind is the wing-suit team dropping in on Deceptacon occupied Chicago.

It also doesn't hurt that UPS did me a solid and delivered my copy a day ahead of the scheduled release so I was able to watch it a day before the rest of the country. What kind of Amazon prime member would I be if I didn't pay it forward with a 5 star review of the product?

The scenes are so discombobulated and do not flow well together at all.  The only one thing that could have deemed this movie is absent namely: Megan Fox vs. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.  I keep watching this movie hoping it will get better but so far it is still awful.  No more Michael Bay Transformer movies.  I think the only way to redeem the Transformer name is to return to an animated movie.

4317449,2,B004BDOEZO,"There is a lot of killing, smashing, crunching, exploding, punching, kicking, and even romance.  The only problem with the movie is the plot.  OK--nevermind that every single autobot and 70% of the decepticons all transform into GM vehicles.  Never mind that a 19 year old kid and his girlfriend always seem to get access to top-secret information without any clearence.  Of course in this movie, he's running around with an M-16 machine gun and a grenade launcher with no military training.

Megatron takes over Earth and declares himself ruler.  The biggest problem is that Megatron only has enough robots to take over New York.  Everyone seems to be OK with this and they send the Autobots away on a rocketship.  Earth is a planet of 5 billion people--technologically advanced and have nuclear weapons.  In previous movies, you can kill a Decepticon with three shots from a grenade launcher.  No one thinks to position a few battleships off the east coast and launch a couple of guided missles at them.  The robots shoot bullets and missles too, y'know.

No problem, the Autobots were hiding in the highly explosive rocket booster the whole time.  They land safely a couple thousand miles away in the ocean, but manage to drive all the way to New York in about 30 minutes even though they can't transform into anything except GM cars.  They swoop in to save earth. Now we have a half dozen metal heros who all know karate and can kill all the Decepticons by punching and kicking them to death. In the end, the 19 year old kid manages to shut the power off of the Cybertron portal even though Bumblebee could've just blown-up the controls with his unlimited arsenal of missiles he has stored in his wrist.  The movie starts bad and ends worse.  Each sequal gets dumber and dumber every time.  I just wish the plot was as advanced as the CGI effects.",1354579200,2,1851,4.681114551083591

Their planet, Cybertron was nigh destroyed in a terrible war led by Megatron, and The Fallen Prime. Optimus and his Autobot friends are on Earth trying to recover the All Spark. The all Spark gives life to any mechanical object. If Megatron gets his hands on it, he could raise an army that will destroy the Autobots, and the Earth for good. Sam is a young man who has become friends with the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. He helps them to fight against Megatron and his Decepticons.

In this volume Optimus discovers his former leader, Sentinel Prime, has been on the moon. After reviving him, they learn that he has created pillars that make a space bridge. Sentinel betrays the Autobots and allies himself with Megatron. They plan to bring Cybertron into Earth's orbit and rebuild it using the human race as slaves. Sam, the Autobots, and the military must stop the Decepticon's plan before humanity becomes a slave race.

This is an excellent movie. It has great special effects, acting, screenplay, and soundtrack. The action and suspense are also quite good. There is also a lot of comedy.

4317472,4,B004BDOEZO,"Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that's for another review.)  Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach.  She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things.  This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action.

I realize it wasn't advertised as HD but I don't think this quite DVD quality which at the very least is what I was hoping to get.  I would also like it if it wasn't encrypted so only the little Amazon video player can play it!  I bought the movie, let me watch it where I want!

Edit:  So my previous assessment was wrong... the problem was that Amazon didn't think my computer could play the HD so it was sending me the SD version when I would stream or download it.  That was bad considering a was watching it via HDMI on my big HD tv.  It looked TERRIBLE.  So I got on my xbox and downloaded the free Prime Video app which allowed me to watch that through my xbox on the same TV and this time I got the HD version.  It was beautiful.

4317548,5,B004BDOEZO,"I can't speak for others because personal taste is (well) a personal thing. When I sit down to watch a Transformers movie, I want to see the animated series portrayed as live action. To be certain, this will never win an Academy Award but at the same time, it makes for some good, mindless entertainment. I watched the animated series with my kids as they were growing up and this film (even more than the two proceeding it) was a closer match. Violence, destruction, fights with real anger and venom... those were the elements that marked the series and set it above other American made animation (still a ways to go to match some of the truly great Anime). This film matched the series on every level.

If you're a fan of the series and don't expect too much stimulating intellectual viewing, this film is for you. After all, Transformers is about the fighting... everything else is just filler.",1351382400,,897,4.6415094339622645
4317549,2,B004BDOEZO,"I had so many issues with this movie I had to write a review- I NEVER write reviews but this was just so bad.

1st the chick - The way Michael Bay portrays and films women in these movies totally sickens me, but he made it up in the first movie with the action and in the second with Megan's contribution during the fight scenes. It's so painfully obvious they only casted this girl because she was prettier than Megan- which isn't a good thing when it comes to quality. She was an okay actress but the relationship felt fake and she was completely useless throughout the whole thing. She was pretty much pushed and pulled throughout the whole movie!

2nd thing- what is up with all these random try-to-be-funny scenes? They felt SO out of place- Mr. Wang is a good comedy actor but the script they gave him was so far from the story it wasn't funny at all. It was like trying to mix the Hangover with Black Hawk Down or something.  Nothing flowed like in the 1st and 2nd movie- it all felt forced and random.

3rd- This was the biggest disappointment - barely any autobot scenes, a lot of stuck up human scenes. I don't know about you but the autobots is the whole reason I watched this series! Ugh,enough said.

I feel so bad giving this movie only two stars but I couldn't bring myself to give it more. I LOVE Optimus Prime! I  LOVE Bumblebee! I LOVE the cars! I LOVE the action! But it just dragged soooo bad for 2 1/2 hours I only gave it 2...sad.",1351296000,,1452,4.261818181818182

Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.

4317553,1,B004BDOEZO,"The original transformers were meant to be a two sided commodity, to be so one half would be a cartoon and the other an action figure line. The cartoon, to be successful would have to be accepted by kids and their parents. To please children it contained action, cars, and a variety of characters, some silly some serious. To please parents the shows would have a passing moral and a code of conduct. In the first animated Transformers movie that code changed and Optimus Prime died.
As I skimmed this movie I was treated to a world of unrealistic fantasy. There seemed to be some fun points, but overall this was a silly movie that crammed together pop icons, more story than was really useful, unbelievable relationships and situations (this is with suspension of disbelief at level 11) and a complete lack of any moral. In fact, when the final battle came to a conclusion it was the hero of the Autobots who took it into his own hands to brutally kill his two foes. The only good thing about this ending is that those foes would be necessary for a sequel. Optimus Prime and the entire cast of characters are all very much adult, all very much amoral when it comes to the enemies they face and the enemies the Autobots face are of course very amoral themselves.
So it comes down to a question of who cares. Who cares if the main human character has trouble finding a job, his girlfriend is smoking hot (but didn't she have black hair at some point?). Who cares if the Earth is threatened, we know it isn't going to be destroyed anyway. Who cares about the Autobots, they are friendly to humans, but they are just as violent as the Deceptocons when you get down to it. Who cares about the humans, they are a bumbling mess. Who cares about those two ity bity Autobots? Wait, I did, I actually thought their deaths (if they did die) were quite heroic.
So that is that, the stakes were low, my investment was low, and this movie, though a commercial success will surely go on the list of rarely watched movies from the teens because it truly sucks.",1350777600,,2046,4.458666666666667

Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible.

I know that's not a deal breaker for most people but it's something I enjoy. This movie had human suffering. Michael Bay usually avoids that which is what makes his the popcorn type of movie.

The storyline offers a pretty cool twist on what ""really happened"" during the 1st Moon landing. Plus you get gratuitous Buzz Aldrin as he is today in a cameo.

OK, so no Megan Fox but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's lips are able to at least act and look good at the same time so no great loss fox-wise. There's certainly not enough of the Witwicky parents who are pretty funny with the limited screentime they get.

Anyway, gratuitous Malkovich, gratuitous naked dude from the Hangover franchise, gratuitous McDreamy, gratuitous Lane from ""Gilmour Girls"" as well as Frances McDormand (say what?) has upped the acting ante but, honestly, any Transformers movie comes down to stuff that gets destroyed real good.

In this case Chicago is a great setting to wreck havoc to plus they apparently mechanized and weaponized a worm from Tremors (hey, everything is Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon---even decepticons) to slice through buildings. All in all it's a decent thrill ride.

4317591,1,B004BDOEZO,"This movie is terrible.  It is the kind of movie that you could dissect frame by frame and explain why literally EVERYTHING that is happening is stupid.  Everything. There is nothing redeeming about this film.  There is nothing memorable about this film.  There is nothing original, creative, or imaginative about this film.  Watching this film is like being chocked to death by having roadkill jammed down your throat.

Join me my friends on a journey of explanation - together we will walk the yellow brick road of why this film sucks.

The plot makes no sense.  None.  A ship escapes Cybertron during the last days of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons.  The ship is caring some ""Prime"" guy and a technological wonder - some sort of teleportation machine.  Apparently the Prime guy is a tech wiz and he is the only one that can make this teleportation apparatus work... and it is special because it could have ""ended the war.""  How?  Who knows.  Nevermind.

Well, the ship gets damaged and miraculously crosses half the known universe to crash on the dark side of the Moon.  Apparently, the Decepticons discover the ship at some point and they take most of the columns that make up the teleportation device.  However, they leave the Prime and 4 of the columns - because Prime is the only one that can operate the machine and they are going to trick the Autobots many years in the future into traveling to the moon to find the ship, and the Prime, bring him back to Earth with the 4 remaining columns, and use the Matirx to reactive him (because the Matrix is the only way to do it), then Prime will betray the Autobots and work with Megatron to reactivate the teleportation machine to ""bring"" Cybertron into Earth space for some reason that would actually make a difference but we really aren't sure of.

Got all that?

Hey Moondonkey? You ask.  How are the Autbots going to learn about the ship on the moon?

Weeeelllllllll... for some reason the Autobots are going to attack an underground Russian installation and find a piece of the ship.  Except that the Decepticons will also have a big worm-like robot there fighting to get the piece of the ship as well (sort of like a metal sandworm from Dune).  The Autobots need to defeat the worm in order to find the ship part so that they can discover the existence of the ship so that they can rescue Prime so that that can reactivate Prime so that Prime can betray the Autobots so that Prime can activate the teleportation machine so that a bunch of Decepticons can jump into Earth space (from where?) so that the decepticons can take over a big city (I forget which one it was) so that they can activate the machine from the top of a sky scraper so that they can teleport Cybertron into Earth space.

Again - got all that.

Soooo... what if the Decepticon worm had ""won"" and gotten away with the spacechip part?  What then?  Then the Autobots wouldn't realize the ship was on the moon and the Decepticon plot to activate the machine would fail.  Ok... So why the F is a damn Decepticon worm fighting the Autobots for the ship part?  Huh?  Why not just let the Autobots find the damn thing?  What sense does this make?

And this is just one example of how stupid this movie is.

Another brief example:
Skip back for a minute - recall how the Autobots went to the moon to find the ship.  They used a spaceship, right?  Later in the movie the Autobots get kicked off of Earth by the humans and they have to rig up a spaceship using shuttle parts because they don't have a ship capable of space travel.  Uhhhh... wait a minute, then what the heck did they use to travel to the moon in the first place?  Why doesn't that ship work?

Another example:
When the Decepticons take over the city, where do the giant Decepticon ships come from?  There are these giant alien Decepticon ships flying around.  Where did they come from?  When the Prime opens the teleportation gate for the first time, a FEW Decepticons slip through.  Ok, fine.  But there sure as heck weren't any giant Decepticon ships that came through the gate.  The next thing we know there is some sort of Decepticon space navy flying around.

Unfortunately, I can't go into every detail of how this movie sucks because it would probably take 20 pages.  I'm serious.  You can dissect every single scene in this film and explain how and why it is stupid.  Every scene.

Oh - final point.  Who is the moron that came up with the idea of making some of the autobots into stupid little comedy relief robots?  Any why would some robots have ""old"" looking robot hair like balding old men?  S...T...U...P...I...D.",1347667200,33,4625,4.530834340991536

Did that have to be the focus of half the movie?

Beyond that, I wanted to watch this movie with my kids, and there was multiple unnecessary swear words throughout. I'm not being a prude here, it was gratuitous use of ""holy s h * t"" and stuff like that. It's one thing if it's necessary for some intense scene, but this was just casual tossing around of swear words. Hey Optimus Prime, how the beep you doing, what a beeping nice day isn't it?

As for the transformers themselves, Sentinal Prime, who is activated after (thousands of) years of sleep after crash landing on the moon, wakes up, and is immediately barked orders at and questioned by this human intelligence leader. Instead of his first response being ""who are you, where am I, what's going on here?"" he simply very casually answers her like ""yeah well the reason is blah blah blah"". It made no sense.

I mean, I was never a fan of the cartoon series or the action figures as a kid and so the idea of Transformers on the big screen way back in 2007 wasn't something I was salivating over.  Still; I kind of loved it.  The first film was fun and fresh and witty and it just felt right.  The second film was a mess.  I kind of hated it.  It had its moments, but overall it just felt forced and overstuffed and messy.  `Transformers: Dark of the Moon' looked promising and then again, it suffered from a barrage of nasty reviews that kept me from giving it a shot; until last night.

I caved.

I said that already.

Here's the thing.  The acting is horrible.  The action is chaotic and stuffy and Michael Bay still has no idea how to edit.  I seriously fell asleep during the films horrifically elongated closing battle.  It was ridiculous.  Sure, the effects are spectacular and are probably the best in the series, but there is such a thing as too much and Bay doesn't know when to stop.  It just kept going and going and once you've seen one overlong battle sequence you've seen them all.  Bay should have trimmed it down a bit and maybe injected something unique instead of regurgitation.

Shia is charming and is becoming his own actor.  This is the worst of his latest performances, but that's because the character is written stupidly.  The rest of the characters are mere stereotypes and serve no purpose.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is hot...I mean REALLY hot, but everytime she's on the screen Michael Bay apparently thinks he's filming a music video.  Her introduction scene was retarded.  The rest of the cast is also surprisingly horrific.  John Tuturro thinks he's Al Pacino all of a sudden, and Al Pacino isn't even good at playing Al Pacino.  Frances McDormand must have had a big fight with her hubby, because she is so above this tripe.  Tyrese and Josh are here for their muscles and Dempsey has no point being here.  John Malkovich reenters his annoying habits for this film.  Yuck, and then there is Ken Jeong.

Just...NO.

The plot, while something `new' seems reminiscent of the previous films and the twist is one you saw coming a mile away.  The ending was also baffling.  The film literally just ends.  It felt off, severely.  I hated the voice over too.  Are we that stupid?  Don't answer that.  I also find the way the transformers talk to one another to be annoying over time.  The fact that they have to explain everything like we're all kindergarteners is just `eye-rolling'.

Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo.  Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog.

4317709,2,B004BDOEZO,"I have to say that I expected this one to be kind of good. But whatever. The visuals were absolutely awesome, that is a given. But overall, I just felt disappointed. The thing is, for a franchise that is ostensibly based on toy robots that turn into and from vehicles, Transformer has a great deal of serious dramatic potential. There are great characters to work with, and interesting philosophical questions to ponder. It was not that I thought that the plot of Dark of the Moon was not any good; it was just rushed, blitzed and obscured by the writing (oh, dialog), editing, and directing style. The one scene that I LOVED was when the Autobots were standing on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral in the sunlight, dwarfed by the starship towering above them. It was a quiet, slow, and sadly, emotionally poignant moment. They do not need rapid-fire, sensory overload battle sequences to be compelling characters. I wish that there had been more moments like that. So anyway, I guess that I was hoping for something different. Was this better than Revenge of the Fallen? I am not sure...I did find myself missing Megan Fox. But Josh Duhamel is always great in his role.",1335744000,,1172,4.694174757281553
4317710,2,B004BDOEZO,"Where do I begin? As a kid growing up in the '80's I loved all the great cartoons (G.I. Joe, Transformers, Thundercats, etc) so when I heard there would be a live-action Transformers film in 2007 I was totally cought up in the hype. Still, I knew all about Michael Bay's style of directing from his previous films (The Rock, Pearl Harbor, The Island). He shoots WAY TOO FAST, he makes sure the dialogue is spewed out so that no one can understand half of it, and he always makes sure the action scenes are so sloppy that no one can see whats happening.
  When I saw the first Transformers movie on opening day I expected that it would be like any previous Michael Bay film: loud, messy, and barely coherent...and he did not disappoint! Still, I found it to be an enjoyable movie despite its obvious flaws (I did buy it after all). Of course, since Hollywood can't leave well-enough alone, especially if they think they can make a buck or two, we all knew there would be multiple sequels and they wouldn't waste any time to crank them out. Since my views of the first film's flaws were shared by so many of the TRUE fans, I had hoped Bay would take them into consideration and correct them for the next films...oh how wrong I was!
  Transformers; Revenge of the Fallen was an unnecessary action trainwreck with annoying characters (the stereotyped Twins, anyone?), an uninspired story that no one could remember, and scenes that made no sense. Case in point: Sam and Mikaela are in the National Air and Space Museum in WASHINGTON DC when they find Jetfire, then they leave the building and suddenly they're in the middle of a DESERT? Can anyone explain that to me??? It was literally a non-stop action sequence that only appealed to pre-teens suffering from A.D.D. Needless to say, I did not add it to my DVD collection.
  With the disapointment of the 2nd film, I lost all faith in Michael Bay as a director, sketchy as it was to begin with. But you know what? I STILL went to see Dark of the Moon on opening day without any expectations that I would actually be sitting down to enjoy a GOOD movie. Two and a half hours later I left the theater with a splitting HEADACHE! You know you saw a terrible movie when it leaves you in physical pain caused by its stupidity. The visuals were good (as is always the case with Industrial Light and Magic), but it doesn't matter how real the effects look if you can't even see them! Every shot literally lasts less than 2 seconds. The only logical conclusion is that the film makers DID NOT want anyone to see what was happening. Really, would it hurt Michael Bay to slow things down even a little? Not at all. In fact, people would thank him for it!
  The new female lead played by Rose Huntington-Whitley (SP?) was only there for the eye-candy factor. Don't get me wrong, I love sexy ladies, but she literally added nothing else to the stoy. Why was she included at all? Because the film makers decided Shia needed a hot girlfriend. That's it. She's also always 'pristine'. She can be in the middle of a battle with smoke and debris everywhere, but she's still magazine-cover perfect. Get real. The only thing I was truly blown away by was finding out that Sentinal Prime was a bad guy ---- did not see that coming.
  Writing out all the GOOD things about the movie makes for a much shorter list, but it's in my nature to point out flaws that should be corrected instead of what needs no attention. Therefore, like Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers; Dark of the Moon was a never-ending action TRAINWRECK with total destruction in every shot; it only appeals to people with an I.Q. below 85. The effects were a sloppy mess, the plot was forgettable (but when was ""story"" ever a priority to Michael Bay?), every line of dialogue was SHOUTED, incoherent, or said so fast you could not understand it. This movie wouldn't even find a place of honor at a yard sale. Avoid it at all costs.",1335312000,,3925,4.484593837535014

4317712,1,B004BDOEZO,"Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers movie look like Citizen Kane. I got about halfway through this movie before I had to stop watching. The plot was utterly nonsensical. I had no sympathy for any of the characters--the sooner Megatron kills Shia LeBoeuf the better--in my opinion. The action scenes were so convoluted, I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be happening nine times out of ten.

4317714,2,B004BDOEZO,"Pros: Beautiful babe. Over-the-top special effects. Cons: Unbelievable script. Horrible writing. Cheesy acting.
The review: I really like Sci-Fi, and have watched every Transformers movie hoping they will be good. So far none have been better than average, and this one is no exception. The special effects are cool, and the great looking girlfriend make this movie worth watching for the eye candy alone. Everything else was... not good. I would recommend saving your money and renting this from the library, because it is not worth a second look. I like my fiction to at least be believable. Bringing another planet into orbit right next to earth? Even if this was possible the gravitational pull would destroy both planets. The parts written for the actors were just plain bad. There was not one person in the movie I could relate to on any level. When the shuttle blew up I was actually hoping the Autobots really did die so they (hopefully) wouldn't make anymore Transformers movies. At that point in the movie I would have been happy to see the Decepticons win. That would have made for an interesting plot twist, instead of the predictable ending we were served up here. I am quite full now, you don't need to feed me anymore sub-standard movies.",1334275200,,1253,4.832558139534884

The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves.

Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago.  Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek.  And what were you expecting Shindler's List?  L.A. Confidential?  The first time you saw Sixth Sense?  It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it.",1333152000,,440,4.551282051282051

It also has VERY, VERY good battle scenes as well, and introduces a lot of cool characters (some have been of course brought from the previous TF movies). I'm nearly speechless of what more to say for this movie. My complaints: The only complaints I have for this movie are really just 1. It is sooooooo draggy at the beginning. One might fast-forward the movie to a certain scene that's worth watching. (Or you can use the ""select scene"" option on the main menu before/after viewing). But be warned, fast-forwarding can cause a misunderstanding in your viewing. So in other words, if this is your first time viewing,(hate to say it),you might want to suffer through til' the good stuff comes along. Trust me, if you like/or love Transformers, and action-packed adventure, you will absolutely LOVE this movie! (Who knows, you will probably [but doubt it] love it more than I did).

So don't try and be super philosophical and deep about the movie and tell me and others we shouldn't like it. Every movie has it's own appeal and goal. The one thing all movies should be trying to do is ENTERTAIN. It's a movie, not a commentary on life and history. This movie is called Transformers. What I expect is giant robots going to war with one side good vs the evil side. In this movie, I got giant robots going to war with one side good vs one side evil. This is not Shakespeare, people. I was not disappointed, especially following the letdown of the 2nd one. I loved the little plot twists too like Sentinel betraying the autobots and the humans siding with Decepticon deal. The jokes were not over the top like Revenge and the action was STELLAR. Michael Bay knows how to do action and he amped it up to 1000. And who needs Megan Fox?",1332892800,2,1021,4.350785340314136

4317744,5,B004BDOEZO,"First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan. From ""Bad Boys"" to ""The Island"",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and ""Transformers 3"" is no different. I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment. And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links. Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox. Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.

4317765,3,B004BDOEZO,"I realize that the ""Transformer"" movies are generally regarded as the non plus ultra of soulless commercial moviemaking and that their popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as an art form.  But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).

Part 3, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" starts with a clever premise:  that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon.  Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.

On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job.  But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.

The one saving grace of the ""Transformer"" movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one).  Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of ""Dark of the Moon"" dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end.  And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role.  But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done.  Which pretty much describes the film itself, come to think of it.",1332028800,2,2149,5.182080924855492

4317837,4,B004BDOEZO,I love this movie. There was some excellent action and a blood pumping score! The actors weren't to bad either. Shia does a great job as Sam. Rosie Huntington Whitely is hot and charming. The Voice actors deserve Oscars! Peter Cullen is amazing as Prime! Lenard Nimoy is excellent as Sentinel (The bastard). And all others voice actors did excellent! Dark of the moon is a fun action movie but serious at the time and it works! It one problem was the ending and the story. THe ending was rushed and the story was weak and has holes here and there. Other than those 2 things a great addition to the action movie genre and the transformers universe.,1329177600,,647,4.491525423728813
4317838,3,B004BDOEZO,"Personally, I found the plot involving the space bridge and Sentinal Prime as traitor to be the most realistic of the three Transformers movies. What kept this movie from being a 5 star is the addition of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly.

First off, we are introduced to her by way of a pantie shot. Then, to ""prove"" that this until now unknown girl is in a ""serious"" relationship with Sam, she proceeds to stradle him while he is still in bed.
So, not only do we jump from Sam and Mikaela declaring there love for each other at the end of ROTF, we jump ahead to where Mikaela is history and Sam's been with some new girl for a long enough time that he finds her crawling on him to be more annoying than anything else.
This suggests to me that the script was written with Megan Fox in mind, but they had to quickly rewrite because Speilburg had a hissy fit regarding her.
My thoughts on this - if you find working with Megan Fox unbearable, just get a different acress to play the part of Mikaela. It was done in the Dark Knight and in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. It certainly would have made for a better story than the introduction of some girl whose relationship with Sam is less believable than the giant robots turning themselves into cars.

My other problem is the Autobots appearing more ruthless than the Decepticons.
The Autobot position is ""We're going to kill them all."" That's fine, but why have a scene where the autobots are taken prisoner by Decepticons where they are shocked that the Decepticons are going to kill them? If the Autobots have adopted a ""take no prisoners"" stance, why should we think it somehow more evil that the Decepticons took the same stance? Same with Dillon hesitating when he had the chance to shoot Sam, yet Sam not hesitating at all when their roles are reversed. It would seem to me that the GOOD guys would be the first to hesitate, not the BAD guys, before killing someone. (This problem, however, is nowhere near as bad as the addition of Carly to the film.)

The movie is quite long as well. If they cut the sophmoric sex jokes and the dull job hunting garbage, and that would cut the movie down to a more reasonable 2 hours.",1329091200,7,2186,4.432835820895522
4317839,5,B004BDOEZO,Dark of the Moon 3D is great! This is why I purchased a 3D TV for action films that make you feel like you are part of the action....,1329004800,2,133,3.6206896551724137
4317840,1,B004BDOEZO,"Look, I understand that with big-name films, there's going to be multiple home versions of it on any given format. Usually there's the basic version that includes the film and maybe one or two features, like a commentary or some deleted scenes or something, but otherwise pretty minimal stuff. That's fine, considering that they often charge only about $20-30 for that kind of version, and usually release the ""real"" special features-heavy version very close to or at the same time as that version. It makes sense, since we think we're getting the ""real"" version by paying more money for something that should be there to begin with. But the existence of the basic version tricks us into buying the ""real"" version, like it's some ultra-special edition, and to own the basic edition is a mark of shame. It makes sense, really. I mean, would you want the crap version of the film with nothing on it but the basic theater version? Of course you wouldn't. But we'll still charge you $10 extra for the ""real"" version under the pretext that it's a special edition of some kind, instead of the reality that it's the only version they expect you to buy at some point if you're a fan of the film.

So, you can see where I'm going here. This is the absolute bare-bones version of the film, with absolutely *zero* special features. No commentaries, no deleted scenes or outtakes, no featurettes, nothing. You get the film. No more.

We'll still charge you $30-40 for it, though. And the special edition, which will be released several months later, will cost just as much if not more than this version. So, what are you going to do? Spend the cash now for the basic version, or be the last to own it at home while waiting months for the real version with all the cool stuff? It puts you in an impossible dilemma that you can't escape. See, production companies have found that people often buy the basic version if they release it at the same time as the special edition, since people often don't care about anything but the film, and will gladly take the reduced price. That changes when they're spread out this far apart. This adds a whole new dimension of what's worth what--and I guarantee you that people are trading in their old editions for the new one right now, and in bundles, just as the studio always planned.

It's great marketing, sure, but it's also an obvious ripoff that doesn't even bother to hide that it's a ripoff. We could have at the very least been given some kind of commentary, bare minimum. Anything, really. Just...Anything. I mean, this is a full-price Blu-ray with a pretty moot digital copy, but it doesn't include what that often entails.

This, in a word, sucks. Hard. They threw out the Blu-ray as fast as humanly possible, while planning the entire time to release a real edition with special features out the whazoo. Studios are always trying to cash in on big-name films with their home releases, especially considering how awful box offices are doing these days (with the insane ticket prices and ridiculous emphasis on no-effort 3D effects, they should have seen that coming), but while I think this deserves no stars for being downright deceptive (no pun intended), you can't blame the studios for pulling off what works to get the most money for the least effort. So, here you go: Transformers 3 on Blu-ray, with all the audio and visual bells and whistles, just without any special features to speak of. And they know that by the time the ""real"" edition comes out, this'll drop in price so much that it'll have the image of being the bad version. Many of you will trade in the original for the new one, and I don't blame you. If you want those special features, you have no choice. This is how they operate, and it works. You don't have to like it, since money speaks for itself in this kind of massive industry.

As a final note, I remember the days when DVDs basically always had two versions that came out at the same time: The basic single-disc version, and the ""2-disc special edition"" version. Almost all movies with any impact did that. The key difference is that both came out at the same time, so you had a reasonable choice to make. One was typically $10 more than the other, maybe even less. The decision was clear, and everything was laid out. Not so here, not anymore. Now you don't even know what the special features are going to be ahead of time, and you're gambling that you can live with the basic version many months after the basic version is released. This kind of trend is very disturbing with the studios taking advantage of this, but again, it just works. The studios are frothing with excitement as people trade in their old Blu-rays for the new special one, just as they always wanted. They're getting literally more than double than what they would normally get if they did it the traditional way, since you're basically buying the movie twice if you fell into this trap.

This version sucks, and cons you into buying it anyway. Maybe you're the type who simply does not care at all about anything except the film, and special features and maybe some video and audio corrections aren't a big deal. Well, then you can probably live with this. If not, then, well, they've got the problem and the solution right here.",1328832000,3,5272,4.609158679446219
4317841,5,B004BDOEZO,"I recently picked up a copy of Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon which included the Blu-ray 3D disc and I am glad that I waited for this final release. I saw the movie in theater last summer and loved it. It was infinitely much better than part 2 in the series was, and almost, but not quite as good as the first one. I will also add that, yes, I missed seeing Megan Fox starring as Mikaela Banes, and I really do not know what the true story is on her departure from the third Transformers film outing is? On the special features disc, Michael Bay alludes to it being because Megan changed her appearance and other issues, and online I have read that Steven Spielberg had her ousted due to her remarks comparing Michael Bay to Hitler. Whatever the case may be, she was certainly missed by me--but--I still enjoyed the new love interest for Sam Witwicky in the form of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer. I think that Rosie did an excellent job in this film and was a joy to watch. If and when they do make a sequel, I hope that Rosie returns as Sam's girlfriend.

Other new cast members that made the movie a fun experience are Ken Jeong of The Hangover fame as Jerry Wang, John Malkovich as Bruce Brazos, Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing, and heck, even TV personality Bill O'Reilly and astronaut Buzz Aldrin make cameo appearances!

Returning supporting cast members include such favorites as Tyrese Gibson as Robert Epps, Josh Duhamel as Lt. Colonel William Lennox, John Turturro as Seymour Simmons, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam Witwicky's Ma and Dad.

Anyway, the best part of the movie is, of course, the Transformer robots themselves...and the action scenes--and man oh man does this movie ever deliver the goods in that department! The robots were awesome as always, especially my favorite robot character, Bumblebee, who saves Sam's ass at least twice in this movie, and Sentinel Prime and Optimus Prime were great as well.

The action scenes were through the roof and very impressive, especially the scenes filmed in Chicago! Certain other scenes were filmed right here in my hometown of Detroit as well.

There is just so much to see, appreciate, laugh with, and enjoy in this blockbuster movie. If you are a fan of the Transformers, or action movies in general, then give this film a go. The 3D was very good as well. It does not feature any ""Pop Out"" in-your-face effects, but it still was pretty fun and made some scenes feel even more interactive.",1328572800,3,2484,4.636363636363637

4317844,5,B004BDOEZO,"Hello

I watched this movie for the very first time today...yes, my first time with the movie. I held off for numerous reasons, one we had to get a new TV to replace our 2009 Sony LCD. That ended up being a Pansonic 55"" GT30 Plasma with new Panasonic BDT210 BR player and 3Active 3D glasses. I started out with the 3D movie and thenwtched the normal BR after it.

3D Movie.... as with most 3D movies you have to del with a slightly darker or toned down version from the normal BR due to the tint in the glasses. I changed my sets setting to ""Vivid"" with a some tweaks. Now some look at 3D as objects need to move forward and back to exprience it or enjoy it. If you're looking for a movie throwing things at you to make you jump and grab don't bother. It is there to add depth overall and not just motion. In some cases it's better with some scenes than others. Think of Transformers and you think action and this movie doen't disappoint in either action, sound and even 3D. There's penty of standout scenes that provides the viewer with more ""depth"" than others. I for one did enjoy the 3D disc.

For the normal BR I consider it almost reference quality ll the way around. You name it, it has it. For someone wanting to know how their TV or a set handles action and motion this BR will put it to the test. For anyone who has a calibrated TV this will also put the set to test in contrast, sharpness, color, details, texture and skin tones. The movie pretty much covers all the bases visually. For audio the True_HD 7.1 track is simply wicked and impressive with excellent surround, good center stage and solid low end. nothing short of a WOW factor.

For some CGI can be either not enough or too much. It needs to be a happy balance of being real and not real yet make believers out of the viewers. If this has too much CGI, not real looking, or unbelievable or fake looking I can only imagine what they call Avatar. With any series of movies one has to expect upping the ante to outdo the previous one. Dark of the Moon does exactlly that by increasing the size, scope, scale of the battle, location, participants. You have real people, real locations, real items, real buildings, real interaction of surroundings with a good balance of CGI thrown in. The camera work and angles is quite impressive. And the detail of the Auto_Bots is simply stunning with the complex machinery and parts. It's not like 75-80% of the film is all CGI. Storyline is in line with the other Transformers movies with the main plot around good and bad Auto-Bots, national security on line with love and family issues in the mix. Overal a fun ride and a sight to behold.

Fission Mailed

Where to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his fort and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place.

The movie; love it, the action sequences are pretty amazing and it looks great on Blu-ray. This final version of the series is much better than the second which was sort of silly and probably intended for teens. I'm also surprised the studio added not just the crappy version for ultraviolet but I think they realized users were pretty upset about the ultraviolet experiment and also added an iTunes versions. Yay, I think someone out there actually heard how upsetting ultraviolet was. The one true issue I have with this movie is the 3D. The 3D doesn't seem to have as much depth as other movies and I know they we're holding off on releasing the 3D version but I'm not sure it was worth waiting for.

Positives:
+Price (Incredible pricing) Disney should pay attention
+Picture (Looks sharp and bright in 3D and standard blu-ray)
+Sound (7.1 channels of heaven)
+Digital Copy ( Ultraviolet & iTunes Copy)

Negatives:
-3D (Not as much depth, was expecting more since they took a while to release the movie)
-Ultraviolet (this just needs to end)

If you were smart you waited until now to buy the movie and this time waiting really paid off.

Has anyone noticed there is a CGI soldier closer to the end of the movie?

4317862,5,B004BDOEZO,"Beyond the in-depth film analysis that you can find elsewhere, it should be noted to any and all considering adding this 3D bluray to their stereoscopic collection that the 3D is just outstanding. Michael Bay and the Paramount execs decided to film this flick in native 3D and what a great decision that was. The first scene depicting the autobots fleeing Cybertron is an absolute 3D spectacle in its own right (granted entirely CGI). The depth contrast between the highly detailed Cybertron and the ships that surround it was a feast for the eyes. Another scene that comes to mind is the wing-suit team dropping in on Deceptacon occupied Chicago.

It also doesn't hurt that UPS did me a solid and delivered my copy a day ahead of the scheduled release so I was able to watch it a day before the rest of the country. What kind of Amazon prime member would I be if I didn't pay it forward with a 5 star review of the product?

There were battle scenes where the Transformers changed form so rapidly and destroyed so much that you couldn't almost get your mind around it to see all the details.

The movie is just proof that special effects in and of themselves do not totally make a good movie. There has to be a solid script and some good character actors to make it an interesting movie. My wife fell asleep 3 times during the movie and she likes Sci-Fi.

The film is 154 minutes long and could have been edited to a two hour movie with a tighter script and plot and been much better. Megan Fox was replaced by a beautiful actress named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who is Sam Witwicky's new girlfriend. It is amazing that they found someone more beautiful than Megan Fox.

If you hated them both, then you're not reading this.

The visuals are, as has been the case with this iteration of Transformers, outstanding.  The Blu-ray quality is a must in my opinion as the details in the action sequences are spectacular.  I personally don't have a 3D television so I cannot comment on that feature, but, the video and audio quality made watching in high definition with an average sound system a very fun experience.  The visuals are very clear, the colors look great, and all of the explosions rumble proudly.

The story is, well, good enough.  I wasn't watching for the story.  I was watching for big robots and stuff blowing up.  The story delivered that in large supply.  If the goofiness of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen turned you off, I can honestly say that it has been toned down here, and the action, not the dialogue, carries this film.  You will have a much easier time believing that giant transforming robot aliens exist, than believing that Rosie Huntington Whiteley chooses to date an unemployed Shia LaBeouf however, when there is a billionaire ""McDreamy"" Patrick Dempsey knocking on the door.

Overall, transforming robots look really cool blowing up a city, and that's what this disc is all about.  Enjoy.",1326153600,13,1564,4.787313432835821

This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isn't self imposed.  The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.

Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience.

As for this particular item itself, I'm really getting upset w/distribution companies who make sure to put TM after Blu-Ray and R after Digital Copy on the front of the cases yet do nothing to denote there's a caveat to the digital copy. Then they put in tinytinytiny print on the back of the box that there's an expiration date for the digital copy installation. I have really good eyesight & I have a very hard time reading this info. For Transformers #3 the gotcha is that its code may not be valid after 09/30/2012.

4317946,2,B004BDOEZO,"Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.

This is the way ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was meant to be seen: in 3D!  I saw this movie in 3D at the theater and I can tell you it was a great experience.  The movie itself has some flaws, but the stereo image was simply amazing... say what you want about director Michael Bay, the man knows how to shoot action sequences!  This is one of the most entertaining 3D movies to date, and is a no-brainer for anyone with a 3D TV.

Not only is the picture quality top-notch, but the sound is great too.  I recently watched an interview with sound mixer Greg P. Russell, and he said that the TF3 blu-ray sound mix was specifically tailored for home video release.  Anyone who owns the previous blu-ray release would agree that the sound mix is incredible.  This blu-ray will make a great demo when you show off your home theater system!

4317967,1,B004BDOEZO,"Where to start....Well, firstly, why a national/world hero, who received a presidential medal, would be begging for a job? Anyone would hire him, if not for his skills, but in the very least, for publicity. John Malkovich's character was completely pointless and a waste of screen space (nothing against the actual actor, but he was poorly placed), ex: the red/yellow cup nonsense. Actually, about 30-40 minutes of the entire movie could've be easily taken out for the sheer god awful humor. Secondly, what is the purpose of Rosy's character? She is nothing but a piece of a** without any real functionality. Her relationship with Sam is not believable at all. I never bought for a second that they were in love and, in his words, she was ""the one"". At least Megan Fox was useful, she didn't just offer support to fight Deceptacons and help Sam, we could see their relationship grow and develop from high school acquaintances to full blown romance. But this woman was either flaunted as Sam's mandatory love interested or needed constant saving.

Surely, the movie has a lot of good special effects, but no actual plot, character development, humor, and believable romance. Sam keeps whining about the same things he did in the first film, except that now he should've grown up a bit.",1324857600,4,1284,4.863013698630137
4317968,5,B004BDOEZO,"Great movie in the series, Transformers 3 is just as good as the two before. Item was sent from Amazon with no problems at all. Thanks!",1324771200,,135,4.230769230769231
4317969,3,B004BDOEZO,"Good visual effects...but missing the relationship between the autobots and the main character.  I did not like the new girl, just a set of oversized lips.  I prefer Megan Fox who had attitude and natural beauty.  Would have been better if main character had put his friendship first with the autobots, then with his ""love?"" with the new gal.  I didn't see what he saw in her anyway, her character was horrible!!!  I still think Optimus and Bumblebee are the main stars that deserve more air time.",1324771200,,497,4.666666666666667
4317970,1,B004BDOEZO,"I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones!  I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections.  Ouch.  All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future.  My bad.",1324598400,3,499,4.221052631578948
4317971,5,B004BDOEZO,"Another great Transformer movie.  If you liked the first two Transformer movies, you'll like this one as well.  Several events from actual world history are worked into the story line early on, which makes the movie a little more interesting. Also, there is a twist about halfway through that you won't see coming, but it too makes the movie more interesting.",1324598400,,359,4.868852459016393
4317972,4,B004BDOEZO,"Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained.",1324512000,,693,4.421875
4317973,1,B004BDOEZO,"As usual in this series, the writing was a joke. The effects were spectacular, but I winced several times at the cheesy dialogue and woeful exposition.  The animated move from the 80's is a much better story.  I'd heard that this installment was much better than the first two, but I was just as dissapointed.  I also thought we might have less women walking around looking like expensive call girls with Megan Fox's exit, but there was even more gratuitous butt and boob exposure than in the others.  I should have known better than to waste my 4 dollars and 2 and a half hours.  Don't let your kids watch this!",1324425600,6,612,4.4774774774774775
4317974,5,B004BDOEZO,Love it but not as good as the other 2.  Shia is great as always and love the soundtrack also but that is just me.  Very good graphics but I was really paying more attention to the story and ya gotta just love it when dictator obama is spliced into a movie as the good leader that he isn't and they made George W. Bush look like an idiot.  But this is hollywood and they suck.,1324252800,2,376,3.9210526315789473

4317986,1,B004BDOEZO,"Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.

The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray.",1324252800,4,484,4.694117647058824
4317987,1,B004BDOEZO,"Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague.",1323993600,3,484,4.511363636363637
4317988,1,B004BDOEZO,Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011.

4317990,1,B004BDOEZO,"You know how people say ""There's bad, there's worse, and then there's so-so""? Well, there's bad, there's worse, and then there's Transformers: Dark Of The Moon.

Like every Michael Bay movie, there's bound to be explosions, over-the-top action, and gorgeous ladies galore!! After having seen Transformers 1 & 2, and hearing that Megan Fox had gotten replaced for comparing Michael Bay to Adolf Hitler(and perhaps he should be), it was a kinda curious matter that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was gonna be taking the hot GF spot over Megan Fox. Honestly it got me mad to the point of throwing out my July issue of Maxim cuz Huntington wound being on the cover.

On this movie, Rosie's charactor has no functionality other than showing off her rear-end, and then getting kidnapped by Decepticons. Everything else in the movie is just a bore until the last hour of the movie(its a long movie: 2 and 1/2 hours plus). It then becomes an incredible action movie. Its cool, or at least it wouldve been if the story was something truely unique, and not something that creates the lamest plotline ever. Personally, i think Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was 1000 times better than this movie and the best movie of 2011. I'm not bashing the cartoon that people have loved for so long. I'm bashing the damned moron responsible for making this atrocity happen, michael bay.",1323734400,4,1371,4.829787234042553
4317991,5,B004BDOEZO,have all of them now..was a good movie..only part that sucked was them replacing sam's girlfriend w/someone else..other than that it's filled w/lots of action and all those Autobots..,1323561600,,183,5.344827586206897
4317992,5,B004BDOEZO,I am so glad I got this Transformers Video for my younger brother he is going to love it and it is in brand new condition. Thank you for this great Christmas present at a great rate !,1323475200,,183,3.8421052631578947
4317993,5,B004BDOEZO,"Loved it!  I'm a big fan of the first two, so I was really surprised to find this one to be better than either of the previous ones.",1323388800,,132,3.7142857142857144
4317994,3,B004BDOEZO,"First of all this is a bare bones release, there is no extras here, none, not even a trailer, nothing, it is the movie on blu ray and on DVD and that is it. There will be more deluxe releases later so you might want to wait for those if you are interested in special features.

Now as for the movie itself it has it's good points and it's bad points. If you have seen the first two films, and you really should do that before watching this one then you already know the premise, a few yeas have passed since Revenge of the Fallen, Optimus Prime and his gang is helping the USA military keep law and order all over the world, a bit of an odd concept for those of us viewers who are not American, and Sam has graduated collage, got a new girlfriend and is trying to get a job while missing the adventures he used to have with his giant robot friends. Things get complicated quickly as it is discovered that Cybertronian artifacts where found on the Moon decades ago during the space race and now both sides of the Transformers want them.

Let me start with the good sides to this movie. The special effects are amazing, the robots are more fluid than ever before and fit seamlessly in with the real life actors in the finished product, those that made this movie know their computer graphics. We get to see more of the robots in this movie than the two preceding it, there is still to much focus on Sam and the other human characters but at least now the robots get enough screen time to develop their personalities a bit more. The twins are gone, yes you know the annoying, racist, hillbilly robots from the the second movie, yes they are gone, instead the two small Decepticon turncoats also encountered in Revenge of the Fallen are the new comic relief characters and they are actually funny and allot less annoying than the twins. The storyline in this movie is decent and is actually rather fun to watch.

The bad about this movie, well where do I begin, first off all it begins well but after a while the action get ridiculous, there is never a quit moment in this film, even when something is not blowing up and no one is fighting people are screaming, the little turncoats are up to their antics, and generally I found the movie tiering to watch as while I do appreciate some good action, without some quiet moments to digest it all it can get rather tiering and confusing. It is as if Michael Bay where afraid his head would implode if there where not action, screaming and frantic behavior in every single scene of this movie. I also think that many of the characters are under used, especially on the Decepticon side. Also as a life long Transformers fan I am still not to fond of the visual design of the robots and what Bay have chosen to do with the setting. Michael Bay have said that he disliked allot of the original Transformers setting as it shows, generally I think that someone who do not fondly remember Transformers from their childhood would enjoy this movie, and the others in the series, allot more than those of us that do.

All in all Transformers Dark of the Moon is a decent film, it have good action, an interesting story and good characters. I think the movie have some rather large flaws, and the lack of special effects on the blu ray set is disappointing but I still recommend this movie, I would however recommend that you wait with buying it until the more deluxe sets is released, and I also recommend that if you are a G1 Transformers fan that you banish the idea of this movie having anything to do with your childhood heroes before you see it, that way you will not ask why Ratchet is candy green, why Soundwave is a sports car and speaks in a warm, animated tone of voice and why Megatron transformers into a rusty lorry that look like it belong on a hillbilly farm.",1323388800,,3806,4.379066478076379
4317995,5,B004BDOEZO,"Outstanding!  PQ and AQ are 5x5, and earn my highest accolades.  Michael Bay really pulled out the stops on this one, so don't blink!  Only downside on this release is the lack of special features.",1323388800,,197,4.571428571428571
4317996,5,B004BDOEZO,"Michael Bay's third installment of ""Transformers"" is worth every penny, even if all you want to do is show off your surround and high-definition setup, especially due to its astounding 7.1-channel Dolby TrueHD audio and relentless action scenes. To the story in a minute, but first, the sound is a big deal because few big pictures as of the end of 2011 are filmed in 7.1. The difference between 7.1 and the 5.1 that your ears are used to is mind blowing, assuming you have a 7.1 system. It fills all the corners of your listening space freakishly well, putting even the subtlest sounds in the corners of the room, behind the couch, under the couch. The movie gives you crystal clear stereo transitions and sounds that seem to snake around you, moving from one speaker to the next. Sounds are where they should be, and they can surprise you. Simply put, this is one of the richest sound experiences you can get in a movie, even without 7.1 I'd wager.

Now, that story I promised. If you think ""Dark of the Moon"" is a rehashing of the same old stuff, you're not completely wrong. But the elements that made the first two movies work were pretty good. The Decepticons are back again with a plot to take over the world, and it's up to Sam and the Autobots to shut them down. Rounded characters and glimpses into the ""Transformers"" universe keep things interesting. Shia LaBeouf and the actors who portray his parents gel as well as ever, with Sam the ever-geeky comic with heart. And the guys won't be able to take their eyes off his girlfriend. Nearly every character has a motive and compels the story forward, and once it gets going, the action seems to never end. Bay takes us to the brink of Earth's destruction like never before. Perhaps there are only so many ways a robot can spin, dodge and attack another robot, but it never stops being fun to watch, especially with Bay's cinematic standards, with visuals so sharp and contrasty they almost hurt your eyes and animations that are still dumbfounding. You'll want to watch it again.

In perspective, if this had been the first ""Transformers,"" it would have been even more mind blowing. But if you can't walk away somehow enriched from some of the best visuals and audio on the planet, a compelling and fast-moving -- if not a bit complicated -- story, some of the most intense action ever, and the biggest-hearted robots in the universe, maybe movies aren't for you.",1323388800,,2422,4.617169373549884
4317997,3,B004BDOEZO,"This film makes an awesome *Blu-Ray*.  I would not have purchase it otherwise.

If I could I combine my score for the film (2) and my score for the Blu-Ray (5), I'd give it a 3.

So starting with the good, this film have great visuals.  This third entry in the series has really refined the CGI established in the first film.  The ""graphics"" look great especially in slow motion.  The special effects are for the most part seamless and very sharp.  There is so much that goes on in the third act in the movie that you can completely skip the first two thirds of the film just to see what in my mind are the most valuable parts in the film.  I watched this on a 120HZ TV with the ""Smooth Motion"" effect on.  If you have this feature it makes for a great viewing experience for this film.

Of course in an action movie like this you get amazing sound as well.  Transformers 3 makes excellent use of surround sound.  Just watch the opening prologue and the title card sequence and you'll see what I mean.  It's easier for me to rate video rather than sound so I'm not sure what else to add here.  It will make great use of all of your speakers is what I can say.

Transformers 3 is bad.  I like mindless popcorn films like Bad Boys II, Independence Day, Battle Los Angeles, and even the first Transformers.  I also like ""so bad it's good"" films; Wicker Man, Rocky IV, or Armageddon which kind of falls in between.  This film does not fall into either category for me.  It's neither a fluid popcorn film nor an ironic masterpiece.  I'll explain why.

Entertainment.  If I can watch a film from start to finish without being bored then that's mission accomplished on some level.  There's a large chunk of the first half of the film that deals with some fact-finding and conspiracy theory.  Although there's a little action thrown in, I absolutely did not care for this whole part of the movie.  Thing weren't worth watching until Chicago is mentioned.  If you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean.

The acting ranges from decent to good albeit a little over the top at times but this is mostly for comedic relief.  The characters were just not fun which again lowered the entertainment factor.  Most were just irritating and pointless.  I wish they had not brought back John Turturro or introduced Frances McDormand.  The second film already had the government officials acting as obstacles to the Transformers.  Introducing a really cold character lacking personality did nothing for me it was just a dislikable character and not in the cool Sylar from ""Heroes"" sort of way.  You'll notice these two also don't take part in the outstanding action scenes which show just how much you need these characters.

Speaking of useless characters, Rose Huntington-Whiteley is the love interest replacing Megan Fox and really the only example of truly bad acting in the film.  I felt this movie really didi not need a damsel in distress aspect.  After two films we're introduced to some strange woman with no established history and suddenly she's presented as the soul mate of our protagonist and also the centerpiece to the whole Chicago adventure (SPOILER: the main reason our heroes travel to Chicago is to save her).  Again, I don't think they needed John Tuturro or his butler.  The film wisely reduced the part of the parents which should have been done all around to shorten the boring parts.  The soldiers played by Josh Duhamel, Tyreese Gibson, and a few others are also in the film just so the Decepticons have someone too shoot at them and create explosions.  The plane jumping sequence was very cool though.

On the upside we have a character who I will not name for spoiler reasons.  I think it should have been established early on in the series that the Decepticons might have humans working for them.  This is shown early in the film during the exposition.  I think having an opposite to the Sam character should have been established in the second film if not the first and could have been interested to watch that character's journey which would culminate in a showdown in the 3rd film.

Finally, this movie did not feature the Transformers enough.  It's bad enough they used overcomplicated designs that strayed from the original Transformers (Optimus Prime being sort of the only exception) but we also don't get enough scenes where we see the robots interacting.  They're merely used for the action.  The scene where the Autobots are sneaking around Sam's house in part 1 and the desert meeting Megatron has with Sound Wave and Star Scream in part 3 are some of my favorite parts in the series.  It just feels like this is what Transformers should've been more about from a story perspective.

All that aside.  This is a great *Blu-Ray* to own and I will be keeping it in my collection.  It'll be nice to whip out every once in a while and kind of ignore in the background until that third act comes up.  At that point I'll take a seat and turn the volume up to high.",1323302400,,4980,4.580973952434881

4318005,1,B004BDOEZO,"I'll give this movie 5 stars for special effects, but who cares.  Talk about overkill. This is for the video game crowd who can stand to play for hours on end.  If you want a similar thrill as this movie gives but not take 2 1/2 hours to do it you could try to down a fifth of tequila real fast or jump off of a tall building and land on your head.

The effects are spectacular, the acting is very good, production values all top quality, and the soundtrack music reminds you when you should feel sad, excited, tense, or whatever.  The problem is I didn't feel much of anything except really bored.

My favorite part of the movie was the ending--or should I say, when it ended. Oh man, I couldn't wait for this film to end.  But compulsive as I am to watch a film all the way through, I stayed to the end.  What a waste.

Yeah, this is the kind of film the makes you want to stand up and cheer.  When it was over I jumped up and cheered, ""Yay! It's over at last!""

The things lacking in this movie are good story and heart.  It's the same old song that we've heard before and it's not one you want to sing along with.  Maybe if they'd saved a hundred million or so and made the film about an hour and a half shorter and then distributed the wealth of what they'd saved to people who needed it, the world would have been a better place and the film makers and investors would have still made a ton of money off of it.

If you haven't seen this film yet and decide to do so, you can't say I didn't warn you.  Sometimes people think they just have to suffer the torture to see what it's like for themselves.  Ouch--my head hurts.",1322870400,3,1626,4.069182389937107
4318016,2,B004BDOEZO,"Keep this in mind when reading this review: I LOVED Transformers as a kid. They were the popular thing when I was younger. The toys were hard to find and you were the coolest kid on your block if you had one. The cartoon was innocent and fun and the characters were easily identifiable.

Enter the first Transformers movie. Not bad, but too dumbed down (John Turturro, that was a laughably bad performance).

Enter the second Transformers movie. With the origin-related stuff out of the way, I expected this one would shine. It was AWFUL.

Enter the third Transformers movie. This may have been the movie Michael Bay was trying to make all along. It isn't nearly as ridiculous as the second movie but it still struggles. A lot of the action sequences are done with the shaky cam effect so it can be really difficult to discern at times what is going on. When one robot tackles another, good luck trying to make out who is who. The easily identifiable traits from the cartoon series have been replaced with a much more generic look for all of the robots. The comic relief seems to borrow from all kinds of undesirable stereotypes and the humor is largely classless. This isn't a movie you should be proud of showing to kids.

Of course, if you enjoyed both of the previous installments, you will most likely enjoy this one.

A couple nerd points: just because robots are old doesn't mean they should have beards. I mean, really. Also, why is Megatron, the most powerful evil robot, subjugated to being someone else's whipping boy in the last two movies? The entire cartoon series was between Megatron's Decepticons and Optimus Prime's Autobots. Isn't that enough? Why introduce ""the Fallen"" and then introduce this other character that nobody has ever heard of? Because the evil guy needs to die at the end and you can't re-kill Megatron over and over? It seems rather lazy of the ""writers"" to brush off the main rivalries.

All of the actors mailed this one in, too. ""Come do your scenes half-heartedly and let's make some money"" appears to have been their guiding directive. When movies gyrate between not taking anything seriously at all, then forcing these same goofballs to act deadly serious, it just doesn't work very well. It's disposable entertainment. And I'm rather pissed Michael Bay has chosen this franchise (he thought the Transformers franchise was a stupid idea before he took the job) to crap all over. This was my childhood. I had just forgotten what George Lucas did to the Indiana Jones series when this garbage came and destroyed something else that was good when I was a kid.",1322697600,,2597,4.7218543046357615

4318020,1,B004BDOEZO,"When I see people calling this movie ""great"" or any other word that's just talking it up so much, I want to smack the person that's saying it. The first movie in this franchise is a really good summer sci-fi/action movie. However, the second one in the series decided to focus more on having no plot at all, showing girls run in slow motion, horribly placed and distasteful humor, and having entirely too much of the human characters in the series.

Well, if you were a fan of the series hoping to see the wrongs of the second movie righted, you might as well not even watch this. This movie is two hours and 45 minutes long with nothing worthy of note until well into the third act. Half of the dialogue in this movie is made up of characters saying how hot Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is. Good thing, too, because she turns in a horrible acting performance, but don't worry... she's nowhere near alone. Ken Jeong, John Malkovich, and Patrick Dempsey give some of the worst performances that I have ever seen. This is hands down one of the worst experiences I've ever had watching a movie... I don't know if I've ever checked the time so much while watching one. I completely understand the ""suspension of disbelief"" involved with a sci-fi movie, but Michael Bay asks the audience to suspend their intelligence at many points in time during the film. If you like twenty minutes of mindless violence with two hours and twenty minutes of horrible plotline and absolutely no substance, then this is totally your movie.

I do appreciate the irony in the government getting outwitted by the Transformers again!

I know it's in the script, and it gives good drama... but it's the same story line over and over.

Pretty clear quality and great action. Too much focus on the humans, should feature more of the Transformers.
Bluray is great but contains NO extra content whatsoever. Only contains the DVD and Digital Copy.",1320451200,2,296,4.94
4318104,2,B004BDOEZO,"I think this one is worse than the second one, although I am not sure. I don't really even remember the intricacies of the plot. Something about a space gate being setup by the decepticons, sending evil aliens to earth through the portal. This was the master plan this time. Yeah, I'm pretty sure thats it and its in Chicago to. Also, Meagan fox is gone. Rosie Huntington-Whitley is in. Who? Yeah, I checked. She is a Victory Secret model. Never had done any acting before ever. Surprisingly, she was not even that bad and far from the worst thing about this movie.

Ok, plot you ask? Well, Shia Labeauf is jobless living with his new girlfiend, Rosie Huntinton-whit......(im not writing that every time). His decepticon fighting days are in the past. Bumblebee does not even live with him anymore, although he would not be able to fit in their ultra deluxe downtown apartment. Its a good thing Rosie has that sweet job for a really rich guy who sells cars. Otherwise, they would be out on the street, but sam feels lost. He can't find a job and when he does, its not what he wants. ""I just wanna do something where I'm appreciated"", says sam. I just wanna be somebody! ""You have to pay your dues"", says victoria secret model. Fortunately, the hum drum life of being regular is broken. Sam is needed once again to fight the decepticons. A new control freak type lady has taken over control of the autobot operation. She dosn't respect Sam and doesn't want his help. Of course, its irrelevant. We know he's back in the game. It's a new story this time. Probably better thought out than the last one, but its ultimately the same thing. Gotta keep those decepticons from doing bad stuff. The story is made to be much more epic and the last part of the movie is generally exciting albeit makes no sense. The Decepticons are trying to setup their portal in Chicago I think it was. Its a warzone in there. Sam goes into it with nothing. He flies on machines. Gets knocked around. Rosie is there to. So are the army dudes from the last two. Theres some excitement in sky scrapers with impossible falls and explosions. They end up back on the ground somehow from being 90 stories in the air.

I found this one to be more boring than the last one which was quite unexciting. The first one felt like a real adventure. This one does not capture any of that magic.",1320451200,2,2352,4.467441860465116

4318107,4,B004BDOEZO,"Michael Bay's third Transformers movie closes what begun with the first one (he said that himself). I can say that this movie is much better than the second one which was nothing more than a sex comedy with robots and explosions.
DOM is set in a much serious tone than ROTF. There are some points filled with a sense of doom, there are a lot of transformer deaths and for the first time in the cinematic saga of the Transformers, we see Cybertron!
The toilet humour is still here but fortunately it is pretty much contained. Hoewever, what i didn;t like is that there still emphasis torward the human (especially Sam) relationships.
Overhaul, it is a very good wrap up to the trilogy. If there are planning on new installments? Well only time will tell but if we take the box office performance into account, then Transformers 4 is not far away.",1320364800,2,845,4.565789473684211

4318169,1,B004BDOEZO,"As another reviewer wrote, I watched this partly out of morbid curiosity (while trapped on an 8-hour trans-Atlantic flight): How low could Michael Bay go?  Or could he somehow redeem the embarrassment that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and re-capture the excitement and solid sci-fi/action spirit of the first movie?  Well, the answer is no.  At the risk of repeating other disappointed reviewers, ""Dark of the Moon"" is an utterly lazy, mind-numbingly stupid re-hash of cliches, offensive potty humor, and implausible ""action"" scenes that insult the intelligence even of fans willing to go to great lengths to suspend disbelief for the sake of this movie (a dozen mostly-retired soldiers with 21st century firearms and 6-8 Autobots wipe out hundreds (or thousands...it's not really clear since they position themselves around the whole planet) of Decepticons armed with futuristic lasers??  The idiocy just goes on and on and on.  More pointless blather from Sam's parents; more offensive sterotypes in the form of bit-part Autobots; lots of blurry action that is so close-up you can't even tell what's happening.  It's as if Michael Bay decided since he did a decent job the first time, there was no need wasting good animation on the point of the WHOLE FRANCHISE: robots that ""Transform"" into vehicles!  The first film actually put some effort into depicting these scenes in CG.  In Dark of the Moon, the machines just pop in-and-out of vehicle or robot mode so fast you hardly notice.  Short story way too long: while I really enjoyed the first Transformers movie, Dark of the Moon is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.",1319846400,4,1635,4.981617647058823

4318189,3,B004BDOEZO,"Unlike many other reviewers I liked the plot of this movie.  I found it engaging and enjoyed the twists in the storyline.  The action scenes were awesome, though not comparable to the first film, I thought they looked great.  The scene with the building falling over was incredible.  I enjoyed that they continued to use recurring characters that are now very familiar.  It cracked me up that they were watching Star Trek and then Leonard Nemoy was the villain. So, I was fine with this film, no it wasn't the best out of the franchise, the first one is certainly my favorite, but this one wasn't as horrible as others are writing about. With one exception...
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was like a dead flower in a bouquet; everything else is pretty, but you're distracted with that dead flower and wonder, why is it there!!! It is made very clear what her purpose was when the very first shot of her is of her rear.  She might as well have been a cardboard cutout carried around with her hair that is always combed, lipstick always fresh, high heals always on, and ahhh that white coat that never gets dirty even during a battle.  She was so pointless in this movie I could only laugh. Are we the audience supposed to take the relationship between her and Sam seriously?  Who are they trying to kid!! She was the annoying, ALWAYS present damsel in distress.  I really came to resent her as a distraction.  This movie would have been so much better without the blond bimbo who's only reason to be there was to wear low-cut, tight clothing.
On a side note, I'm noticing that all reviews for this film that are 3 stars or less are all negative.  I'll be waiting for my first negative remark:)",1319673600,,1689,4.541254125412541

But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.

I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest.  Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful",1319673600,3,645,4.235772357723577

4318195,1,B004BDOEZO,"Why would you take a franchise that had so much promise, and turn it into a monstrosity of a movie?

When the first Transformers film was released back in 2007 as an `80s child I was highly anticipating my shape shifting robots on the big screen. When I found out that they took the time to gather Peter Cullen to go back to his roots and voice Optimus Prime I was awestruck. After a fantastic film that didn't really give me enough robots that I anticipated I was eager for more. Then came `Revenge of the Fallen' More robots, intense action, but unfortunately more humans and horrible acting in a over 2 hour film. After that a promise was made by Michael Bay that the third film was going to be one of the greatest action films ever and yes there would be more robots and more character development.

`Dark of the Moon' came, there were some amazing action sequences, and yes more robots...BUT...no plot, no acting skill and just a bunch of special effects and explosions to cover the mess all up. This movie has the word fail written all over it I don't even want to purchase this DVD. Hell, this movie makes `Revenge of the Fallen' look good and that says a lot! At this point I am devastated after 4 years of what could have been one of the greatest stories ever told on film based on a true animation revolution, I was left with disgust and sheer disappointment. Take these movies...maybe not the first and bury them deep underground and let's never speak of them again.

We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes.

4318230,2,B004BDOEZO,"It's not the worst Transformers movie... that was the second one.  It's not the best either - that was the first one by far.  This one is just kind of blah.  Lots of action, lots of explosions and not a lot of plot.  Normally that would rate 3 or possibly 4 stars but not this time.  Why?  There are a few reasons.  The new girlfriend is one of the reasons.  She's young, pretty and can almost act.  Sadly her addiction to lip injections at such a young age has given her duckface.  It's distracting and a little scary.  The next is Patrick Dempsey.  Normally he's a decent actor but his character waffled between whiny victim and smug arrogance for the entire film.  It was annoying without adding much to the plot.

The last problem and biggest one for me (which I know doesn't bother most people) was the product placement ads.  Yes, I know these deals are part of the movie industry but the number of times I say Waste Management's logo cross the screen made me feel like I was in a really long commercial for all of the Transformers corporate sponsers.",1319328000,2,1057,4.404145077720207

Shockwaves scenes are arguably some of the best ever done! Looking at these reviews people have become so jaded that nothing can no longer impress them.

4318244,3,B004BDOEZO,"Dark Side of the Moon, as others have pointed out, was not terrible. It had a lot of fun CG, plot, and action. My biggest complaints had more to do with Sam's constant screaming and/or ranting--and I mean CONSTANT--as well as the new girlfriend character. She was completely cardboard. I felt as though she added nothing to the movie aside from her good looks. At least the other girl had guts and grit and played a part in the action. This girl was just a pretty, blonde damsel in a white dress and pumps (oh, yeah--and don't forget the clunky black glasses for whenever the director wanted to show us she wasn't just a dumb hot chick. cheap. really cheap...)

My husband and I fast-forwarded through any relationship angst/talk between her and Sam--they seemed forced and insincere and they cluttered the movie in a weak attempt at a sub-plot. What could he see in her anyway(aside from the obvious)? She had no personality and just got in the way of the story. Yuck.

Otherwise, it was a fun no-brainer.",1318896000,,1006,4.614525139664805

4318257,5,B004BDOEZO,"I agree with a previous poster on the special features for this disc: nada. This film is one in which I'll make an exception about not having special features with it, though. There's no way I can penalize this movie for leaving out the special features because it delivers, no, over delivers on being what it states, and that is an action movie, a VERY BIG action movie. The little kid in me doesn't want to know how they did it. That's how much I enjoyed this film, as the review on its cover says ""the greatest action movie ever made,"" after the movie ended and even as I write this, I can't think of one greater, not even Avatar, which boasted being the most technically complex film made, after seeing this film, I don't know.

But I will say that I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. There were a few lags, some throw-in comedy relief provided by Sam's parents and a couple of small ugly robots, a subplot about Sam trying to land a job, love interest, jealousy, etc. I did get a kick out of John Malkovich as one of Sam's employers, very funny.

The plot was simple and for those who haven't seen it I won't give much away by telling you that the axis of this film involves the Deceptacons' ongoing attempt to take over earth, this time with the help of Sentinel Prime, former leader of the autobots. The difference between the prior films and this one are the scales on which these battles are waged. This one's outsized in comparison, everything's gargantuan. In fact, out of all three films, this one's my favorite and delivers all I ask of this type of film: action, giant robots, and unbelievable effects.

What I really respect about this movie that it is what it is. It's not trying to save the rain forests, it's not out to change the world or revolutionize the way I see movies. All it's trying to do, did, and will do again tonight, is entertain the hell out of me for a couple of mindless hours. I can appreciate this. It's pricey, though, at 29 bucks. Felt a little guilt and remorse when I bought it. After seeing it I was glad I'd spent the money. Thanks, Michael Bay.",1318809600,,2094,4.377892030848329

Hardly a mention of Megan Fox's character, after being the love of Sam's life for the first 2 movies, and knowing vital information about the Autobots. Now this new girl is all of a sudden privy to the information, just like that?  Weird, didn't make sense.  She could have been written in better. Sam's relationship is a very important aspect of these movies, but this transition was ridiculously done.  Horrible job by the writers on that one.

There were WAY too many action sequences in this movie. Michael Bay, true to his character, just enjoys blowing things up in Transformers movie. He took it to ridiculous extremes with this one.  The final HOUR of the movie was a straight fight sequence!  I've never seen anything like it, in over 30 years of watching movies.  Sam narrowly avoided being killed about 760 times during the movie.  Yawn.

This movie was a complete and utter disaster.  The CGI effects were pretty good, but you just didn't care this time around.  No character build-ups, too much action, storyline was hurried, just wasn't a good movie at all.  Please don't make a Transformers 4!",1318723200,4,1356,4.615062761506276

My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.

Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer.",1318723200,4,767,4.478571428571429

4318279,4,B004BDOEZO,"A good part of the idea for this film is based on a novel of a similar title by Alan Dean Foster as well as the 80s TRANSFORMERS TV show. There are some interesting ideas in here that made it more intriguing than the last movie. There are also a number of known actors and actresses who showed up to play supporting or tiny roles (i.e. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and the voice of Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime). In certain parts the story is good but in others it falls apart or has issues, especially when the love interest compels Megatron (come on, that isn't much of a spoiler if you watched the trailers or just know how these things work) and when Optimus Prime gets his second wind. I felt a tad ripped off with the Bee incident but I get a lot of kids are watching this and wanted it to go another way so I grudgingly understand. I did have some secret fun in yelling to my date ""He's no McDreamy now!"" but you have to have watched this movie and know GREY'S ANATOMY to get that reference. Megan Fox was said to have not been invited back by Bay after comparing his work methods to Adolf Hitler. Too bad because the new love interest got criticized even more than Fox. Shia LaBeouf said he would not do a fourth installment and some say that convinced Michael Bay to drop out of the franchise. Look for several Star Trek references.

4318282,1,B004BDOEZO,"A lot had been said by Michael Bay before this movie came out that he recognized the multitudes of problems with Transformers 2 and they were all going to be fixed for Transformers 3.

He lied. The only problem Michael Bay saw with Transformers 2 was that Transformers 2, at two and a half hours long, wasn't long enough.

Before I begin totally railing against this abomination, I'll say some nice things. Transformers 2 had no overarching story. This one kind of does, in that stuff that happens at the beginning factors into stuff that occasionally happens for the rest of the movie. Also, you can kind of make out what's going on in these action scenes, for perhaps the first time in this series. I dunno if that's due to Bay shooting for 3D or what, but you can actually see these action scenes.

Unfortunately, none of that matters. While we finally may be able to tell WHAT is going on on screen, there's still no way to decipher WHY any of it is going on on screen. Characters remain the bane of Bay's career, in that none of them are interesting in any way and none of them have arcs. What the hell have Tyrese or Josh Duhamel done in ANY of these movies? John Turturro? Shia's Parents? Half of the transformers whose names I can't remember because there's nothing memorable about them? I could go on. There are so many characters that serve no purpose and are only in there because Michael Bay thinks they're amusing. They're not amusing and the movie would be much better off without the lot of them. I must also pause and make special mention of Ken Jeong in this movie. His character and performance are surreal. I dunno if Bay let him run wild with the role or directed him that way, but he is the worst thing about this whole movie.

And then there's Shia. Maybe he kind of has an arc in this movie. He occasionally whines about growing up and being a man, but that's all he does. There's no resolution or moment of growth, he just talks about it every now and again. And Shia's acting is downright grating. He seemingly alternates between extreme emotions at random. Remember when Spielberg thought this guy was a big deal? Those times have passed. Even worse is Shia's new girlfriend. If you can find me a more bland leading woman in a film, I'd be shocked. I was no fan of Megan Fox, but she is leagues better than Rosie Big Lips. At least she had a personality.

It'd all be fine if the action was cool, but it's not. Everyone raves about the hour long action scene in Chicago. It's a terrible hour that never ends. There are action scenes that work within this scene (most notably the building falling set piece) but the rest take place for no reason. There's no objective for most of the action scenes and therefore nothing is ever accomplished. The wing suit scene? What the hell did those jerks do once they landed? Nothing! They land and are never heard from again. These action scenes carry all the weight of a screensaver.

I also must bring something else up. In said long action scene in Chicago, there is a good seventeen minutes of screen time where Optimus Prime is caught in wires. Optimus Prime, in case you don't know, is a giant robot who can fly and has a giant gun and carries a sword. And he's caught in wires. For seventeen minutes. Other Transformers even try to come and help him, and he's still caught IN F#@$ING WIRES for seventeen minutes. This is some of the laziest writing I've ever seen. It's also a very good indication that a) Optimus Prime is a terrible character and b) that action scene goes on for far too long.

I don't know why I watched either Transformers sequel. Morbid curiosity, I suppose. I just don't understand why this franchise makes a billion dollars every time out when we have plenty of blockbusters that bring the spectacle without forgoing basic filmmaking/storytelling competency. This summer alone we got Harry Potter, Captain America, X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. All of those movies are wildly better than this trash heap. Hell, even Fast Five puts this movie to shame.

To put it shortly, the Transformers trilogy is the worst trilogy ever made.",1318464000,58,4147,4.527369826435247
4318283,1,B004BDOEZO,"I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING.

It wasn't theatre quality, but it was pretty close to the next best thing, and I thought that it was a pretty awesome ending for the movie franchise.  Leave it to Michael Bay to make kick@$$ films like this one.  I think he was a good choice to helm these movies!",1318464000,,591,3.9411764705882355
4318285,3,B004BDOEZO,"After all the gossip going on during the beginning of shooting on this movie when Megan Fox was nixed from being in Michael Bay's flick because of their school girl sniping at each other, it should have been a hint of the distraction of the filmmakers when this third installment got underway.

We're back with good ol' Sam Witwicki, lovable nerd and accidental hero, who manages to get a medal from Obama that he parlays into snagging a Victoria's Secret model turned actress whom he sweetly calls 'Angel'  no product placement issues there, right?  and who appears to be supporting her unemployed Sammy boy toy because he can't find a job up to his exacting requirements.

Except Sam isn't cute anymore.  He's supposed to have been through literally earth shattering experiences by this time and he's still a stumble bum, except now, he's also acquired a 'look at me and marvel' complex.  The character of Sam has not grown through his supposed experiences, hardships and losses, he's the same stammering twerp except now he's got a blonde British girlfriend with inexplicable, disturbing fish lips and a taste for whining.

His parents, who were wonderful for comic relief and context in the first two movies are barely there in this movie.

The combat team lead by Josh Duhamel show up but they've been split up and no longer all serve duty together until the extra parts hit the fan.

They introduce this new character voiced by Leonard Nimoy and then insert what apparently they believe are subtle little homage lines to Star Trek for him to use during 'pivotal' scenes in the movie that just seem like cheap tricks.

They have relied heavily on the special effects to make this movie worthwhile but even those become tedious because there is no real storyline to support it.

Again, this is an action and sci-fi movie that is meant to entertain, and it does if only because of the ocean of special effects they used to keep it going, but if you're looking for a cohesive story line to pick up where the first movie started and the second movie stuttered, you're going to feel cheated.

It seems that story telling has been all but forgotten in lieu of using bigger and better CGI effects and this movie is a prime example.

What began as great entertainment in the first movie faltered in the second, likely because there was such a desire to beat the first's popularity and profitability.  The result was a good movie with some strong humor.

This installment was OK, but certainly not of the caliber that you'd expect based upon some of the professional reviews from the media movie critics.

I would suggest that Michael Bay take some of the money he uses on special effects and invest in a writer who can actually write a great story to stand up to all the special effects heaped on it.

Maybe then it would be more of a must see than a 'meh'.",1318377600,2,2854,4.642147117296223

4318298,1,B004BDOEZO,Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds.

4318304,1,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a movie I regret having purchased. It is an empty, heartless film; to watch it is to devalue your life a little.

Director Michael Bay has made only two good films: The Rock and Armageddon (the latter is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest, this horrible (and third, if you can believe it) Transformers movie, is his worst film ever.

Bay simply does not work well with CGI, and especially during action sequences. I am reminded of The Rock, and the expertly-directed car chase scene. The explosions, the shattered glass panes, and the upturned trolley were all practical effects. They were executed during the shooting of the film, not added in afterwards by an overpaid visual animation nerd.

Bay's quick cutting works well in his aforementioned two other films. However, in this latest Transformers movie, the cuts provide only confusion and an unwelcome sense of unwieldiness.

As for the acting, well, there is none. The good guys are all good and the bad guys all bad. I felt nothing but shame for serious actors like John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and John Turturro. We all need a paycheck, but to stoop this low is reprehensible.

The other characters--the main characters--are irrelevant. They basically yell and scream much of the time. Oh, and Shia LaBouf's character's girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitely) sure is smoking hot.

But there's no emotional connection between any of these characters. Bay's attempt at making me give a damn about ""Bumblebee"" or ""Optimus Prime"" fell flat, to say the  very least. I do not have feelings for a car that turns into a giant, ugly warrior robot. Call me crazy.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon amounts to 154 minutes of pure, unadulterated vapidity. Life is short, people; to waste two and a half hours of your existence on a film like this is a crime.",1318204800,10,1846,4.894230769230769
4318305,2,B004BDOEZO,"Megatron was going after the Cube on earth AND meeting up with Spock (aka Sentinel) for making the ultimate bad-ass portal?  How many other things will they tack on to that moment in history?  Transformers 4 anyone?

The Soviets took pictures in 1963 of the Pillars drag marks and stockpiled on the moon.  Who were these Decepticons that did this and why didn't they attack Earth for resources if they had nothing else to do?

Soviets never bothered to tell anyone about those early pictures they took?  Sure would have been helpful to the Autobots years ago huh?  Another story spoiler the writers couldn't afford.

Sam's hot model girlfriend (who cares what her name is) has her opening scene showing a close-up of her perfect a_ss in panties.  Can we get back to the robots now and schedule her p_orn movie later?  -And let me know the title for that movie

Poor Sam having it tough getting a job....that storyline took too long and got annoying fast.

Sam just happens to get a job where one of the few human worshiper-spies for the Decepticons works?  That sure was convenient.  And what was up with that psycho Asian guy's attitude?  Were they desperate for the underwear-disgusting, gay-like comedy?

The Autobots revive Sentinel and speak to him in English when they try to calm him down.  I sure hope he had been to earth in the past otherwise I can understand why he's so freaked out by the Autobots' voices.

Sam's parents camp out near Sam's hot model girlfriend's house and give him woman advice....creepy.

Sam tells his mom that his hot model girl is ""the one"".  Really?  If Mikaela dumped him after two big adventures and years together....how long can he last with a hot model who doesn't like him risking his life?

Just after Sentinel reveals he's really with the Decepticons and all h_ell breaks loose and Ironhide is killed, Sam goes back to visit his folks to have the girlfriend chat to change the pace of the movie??

I'm not sure which is worse:  McDreamy as the traitorous bad guy, or Spock doing Sentinel's voice.

The Autobots' ship is destroyed in true shuttle-Challenger-explosion fashion....double creepy.

Sam can't shoot McDreamy from 10 feet away before getting b_itch-slapped?  Of course not, we need McDreamy to turn the Pillar back on again later in the movie...and how did McDreamy know what to push?

Sam basically ruins the Autobots desperately needed surprise attack with his bungled rescue of the hot model.  Nothing like risking the fate of the world on a guy who's jealous-hot for a potential porn star and can't shoot a gun.

They spent a lot of movie time with human strike teams trying to get close to the Trump building but never did...Optimus shot at it via Shockwave's gun.  They could have made a mini-movie of the tipped-building scenes....and I have to say that was the toughest building to destroy I've ever seen.

The humans did ""deceptively"" well battling Decepticons with assault rifles.  Remember how Vortex (the Decepticon helicoptor) obliterated the military base in the first Transformers?

Spock gives his Vulcan line for ""The needs of the many outweigh...."" - that was my first clue that the film hit rock bottom.  There's already enough homage to Star Trek in this movie - don't mess with Star Trek II.

I'm sure Spock's plan to enslave us little fragile humans to work on the huge Cybertron metal planet will work just fine......was I the only one skeptical about this the moment he said it?

I'm also sure that bringing Cybertron into close proximity would have NO effect on the Earth.

Hot model girl saves the world by using her feminine wiles on Megatron??  That was my second clue that the film hit rock bottom.

Megatron can see Spock about to destroy Optimus, so he doesn't wait a few seconds first before shooting Spock?  And then Optimus takes the opportunity to kill Megatron.....see Megaton, that's what you get.

I was very happy that Optimus wasted no time killing Megatron and Spock....unlike Sam who when handed a pistol from Epps, grabs it like a little girl grabbing an icky worm with her fingers.

The film apparently had very obvious product placements, but I was too busy trying to find reasons to like the movie to notice.

What's the best parts?
1. Opening scene on Cybertron.
2. Whenever Optimus is fighting.
3. Any scenes of the hot model in panties or sexy outfits.  And to think, when she was a kid her classmates made fun of her big lips and no b_oobs....where are those loser classmates now?
(It should be noted - the ""Transporter"" dude is bangin her now and he's 20 years older than her.  Now that's a REAL hero.)",1318204800,3,4607,4.731155778894473

4318312,3,B004BDOEZO,"I still think the first Transformers was the best of the series. I had high hopes that the third installment would have redeeming factors after the second was so lack luster, but I was sadly disappointed. Sam has no job and is being supported by his new hot girlfriend Carly, and that's about all she is - hot and pretty.  She really serves no other purpose in this movie.

The Autobots have gone off in search of the Decepticons, but come back when they learn of a ship known as the Ark and its contents crashed on the moon after the Cybertron war back in the 60s.  This moon crash is revealed as being the main reason NASA went to the moon, but it was all covered up. The autobots go to the moon to bring back autobot Sentinel and some pillars that can be used to build a time space bridge for teleporting.

The main problem with the movie is that there really isn't a clear sense of plot line going on here.  It's pieced together with too many other story lines that really serve no importance other than to add time to the three hour movie. Sam is jealous of his girlfriend's relationship with his boss. Sam is mad because he can't find a job.  Sam gets a medal from the president. Sam's parents come to visit. Shia LaBeouf also seemed to be adlibbing most of the time - his banter and screaming really gets on your nerves after a while.

All havoc breaks loose when Sentinel is revived and begins setting up the bridge in favor of the Decepticons.  War breaks out, and you can pretty much guess how it all wraps up.  Not much has changed from the way the first two movies played out.

For a three hour film, it took too long to really pick up and by then it was too late. It's pieced together with too many useless scenes that while you do walk away from the film with somewhat of a clear sense of what happened, most of it just wasn't clearly defined or was left up to the viewer to decipher what was going on.  There's also quite a bit of political agenda which stole away from the quality of the film, and let's not forget all the B movie actors. The end was predictable, and the special effect scenes are nothing glamorous that you haven't already seen in the first two films.

Here's a few things to consider, though. In 2 1/2 hours of movie, I felt like I got about 10 minutes of Transformer fighting in. Seriously. Pretty bad for something billed ""The Greatest Action Movie of All Time."" There was more action of humans running to and from battles, but that was about it.

There's probably about 30 minutes of those slow motion scenes where someone's walking to or from something exploding, or that slow-motion ""dramatic pause"".

10 Minutes of Action does not make an Action Movie! I would have settled for ten minutes of good plot.

On to the spoilers (DO NOT GO PAST THIS POINT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE)
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

So let me get this right, Sentinel Prime is a traitor, but gives the life spark back to Optimus when it's offered to him. Ummm, bad guy Prime, that was game, set, and match. Would have made winning that war pretty easy. This scene is so bad when you see in the very next scene Sentinel shows he's a traitor.

And the second unbelievable point: Sentinal makes a deal with the Decepticons, but they Shoot Down His Ship while he's making a getaway to them? Really?

And the most powerful Transformer ever, Optimus Prime, can't fight his way out of a few cables? Doesn't even try?

Bumblebee and the others are fighting. Prime says ""it ends here!"" Literally 2 seconds later, in the next scene, they're all capture except for Prime and getting executed one by one.

Umm, Michael Bay, what's up with having two Autobots that just toss jokes back and forth? Were the ice-cream trucks lesson enough, or do you have to your own Jar-jar Binks in every movie?

As powerful as Soundwave is, why isn't he king of the Transformers? Seriously. You might have overpowered that guy.

And the guy who's saved the world twice can't even get a job recommendation from the government? Or even talk to the Autobots? Really?

I was so frustrated with this movie I got on just to write this review. I wish it made more sense, but hopefully it conveyed a complete and total frustration with the lack of quality directing and script-writing Hollywood is putting out. A big name or two, some special effects, and they hope we'll all drool through the movie.",1318032000,9,2566,4.941860465116279

4318327,1,B004BDOEZO,"First, let me say that I like the movie.  But if you don't like it, then ignore it.  If you don't know, check movie reviews or rent it first and decide for yourself.  That aside, this review isn't about the Movie - but rather the media.  So, I'll admit that I'm a little late to the HDTV party.  I've actively shunned Blu-Ray - price has been too high and also I have substantial DVD content.  When Amazon offered this title with the Triple format (Blu-Ray, DVD, AND Digital Copy) - and - the price was $19.99 (pre-order) I thought it had to be a mistake.  That's close to my personal 'price point' - and the DVD includes a Blu-Ray and Digital copy.  I've moved to streaming, use  both the Amazon Cloud as well as Amazon Digital Content and have setup my own DLNA Media Server.  This would be a perfect addition to my digital video library - and High Def.  Boy was I wrong.  After Amazon shipped, I started checking my Amazon Digital Library for my new purchase to show up.  Finally, the package from Amazon arrived ON FRIDAY !!! - New releases are on Tuesday, and previously w/Prime, Amazon has shipped on Monday.  Usually, I have the package on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I'm  Amazon Prime, pre-ordered weeks in advance, it's not like it was a surprise or something.  But, ok, I can live with that.  I drive by Wal-mart, Target, K-mart, Blockbuster, Costco & 5 Redboxes every day - If I really needed it on Tuesday or Wednesday I can shop there instead of Amazon.  When I finally GET my 'triple' play - I read on a little insert - that the Digital Copy is a Download from Paramount.  Oh, not quite what I was expecting, but again I can live with that.  So, off I go to the URL to download the Movie.  There is an ITunes option - but I don't do business with ITunes - I have Amazon.  First, you must download and install the Paramount Download Manager (great more crap-ware on the PC).  Only then you can download the Movie.  Transformers-DOTM runs 2:34:40 to watch.  The download file is 2.1GB (the maximum Amazon Cloud Video file size allowed is 2.0GB) - and the download took 4 1/2 DAYS.  The download manager would stop, apparently at random sometime after about 8 hours every day.  The download rate - when it was working varied between 20-50kb/s (old dialup modem speed).  Now, after 4 1/2 days, the resolution on the download is either 720x300 or 320x136 (a second 800mb version) - so It's not 1080 HD anyway - and is no better than the DVD.  They are Windows WMV files that carry DCP - so they don't work with the Logitech Revue - Google TV or the Google Chromebook and I and can't recode them to something else that is compatible - or even split it in 1/2 so I can upload it to the Amazon Cloud.  What a lousy mess - and terrible experience.  To be fair - I did find (too late) - a Amazon FAQ that gave some warning - and did clarify the Digital Copy didn't go to the Amazon Digital Media Library.  Believe me neither Paramount or Amazon will get me to waste any money - ever again on a Blu-Ray - Triple Play or anything else with the deplorable utility of the Digital Copy.",1318032000,5,3080,4.328671328671328
4318328,2,B004BDOEZO,"First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.

The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you.  A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab.  Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year.  From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes.  I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time.",1318032000,2,508,4.3052631578947365
4318329,1,B004BDOEZO,"And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!

And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!

This movie is like a 2.5 hours car crash. When you think it can't get any worse - it does.

It would deserve 2 stars if it didn't have any human actors. But Michael Bay is actually controlled by his computers, and they made him put these humans in this movie to make us suffer even more!!!

This is all I have to say. Transformers IV is coming soon to the theaters near you. Preorder your tickets now!!!",1317945600,6,505,4.229166666666667
4318330,5,B004BDOEZO,"While watching this epic I noticed the human characters didn't help the movie.  I would have much liked to see their final battle on a machine planet much like their own world. Perhaps the creators of Transformers 4 will remedy this in the next film.  I found myself wanting to see what happened before the war. The CGI was amazing.  Leonard Nimoy's voice as the ancient mentor to Optimus Prime was the best part of the movie. Nimoy even used a line he did in the Star Trek II feature film; only in a different context. I wanted to know more about the robots than the human characters.  Ironically, the humans took a back seat to the dynamic robots on the screen.  I certainly didn't buy this DVD so I could see a model with the lead actor, Shia La Bouf (I know I didn't spell that right).

The director did a seamless job with the actors interacting with the robots. That must be the hardest type of acting. Talking to a green screen with a character that hasn't been fully developed.

Another aspect of this movie that was impressive was the destruction of the city in the last moments of the film. The fault of this film was that it could have been a half hour shorter.  There were too many false and predictable moments that could have been on the cutting room floor. Other than that, it was fun to watch. I'd see it again for the battling robot portions of the film.",1317945600,2,1371,4.349019607843137
4318331,1,B004BDOEZO,"Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow.",1317945600,9,452,4.8076923076923075
4318332,5,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers Dark of the Moon is a thrill ride from start to finish! Dark of the Moon has the most compelling storyline of all three. I have been a transformers fan since the beginning in the 1980's and have loved every minute of comedy,romance, and thrilling action in all three films. Sam gets a new girlfriend in Carly and is ready for some more action instead of the daily grind. The shadow side of the moon holds a secret that will change both decepticon and autobot forever. I would have loved to see Megan fox in the third installment as well,but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley does just as good of an acting job to make the movie awesome all around. If you are a true transformer fan you will love Dark of the Moon along with the other two as well. Transformers Dark of the Moon has all of the amazing transformer characters with new weapons that are the coolest. The special effects are some of the best you will ever see,with some of the most kick-ass battle scenes to blow your mind. Bottom line Transformers Dark of the Moon is a 10 out of 10 DVD experience that will please any true transformer fan around. I highly recommend Dark of the Moon along with Transformers,and Revenge of the Fallen. Transformers Rule!!!",1317945600,2,1222,4.5590909090909095

4318334,1,B004BDOEZO,"I enjoyed the first movie.  I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought.  Wow, this one was just  atrocious.

I did like the action -- one of the most action-packed films of the summer. Shia LaBeouf is good as always. And I liked the inclusion of Soundwave and Shockwave, two of the coolest Decepticons. But all of that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. Despite delving deeper into the Transformers epic world-ending battle, which was another driving plot-point from ""Revenge,"" this film had elements that don't make sense -- the first being Laserbeak disguising himself as a pink female autobot. No. That's not how it is in the mythology and it's a little too close to the whole human female transformer from ""Revenge""; if I wanted cyborgs, I'd watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-Blu-ray/dp/B000F9RB9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator [Blu-ray</a>].

The main complaint I have is the girl that replaced Megan Fox.  I'm not a fan of Megan Fox, but this new girl was just awful as an actor and the character was equally as bad.  At least with Megan Fox's character and acting you could believe that she would thrive in those perilous situations (and without running around in super high heels and always bright white clothes the whole time.)

The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}.

There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime.

My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys.  The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever.

The only problem I have is...  special features?  Or maybe, the lack thereof.  I honestly have to admit that I didn't really look at the description to see about the special features because... it's a new movie!!  I pretty much thought all new movies came with SOME kind of special features, deleted scenes, commentary, gag reel, SOMETHING!!  But this didn't and it leads me to believe that they'll probably re-release all three together in a special 3-D, blu-ray pack with 'Never Before Seen Footage' etc... etc...

In my opinion it just sucked a little less than the first and a lot less than the second. The film follows Bay's classic formula for all his movies. People walking in slow motion, check. Incredibly sexy women running in spiked heels, check. Using black men for comic relief, check. Steady streams of explosions and incredible stunts, check. Shots of the military that could easily be put into any promotional material for the armed forces, check. Painfully cheesy dialog and sad attempts at humor. ""Dramatic"" scenes that are only dramatic because of the orchestral score of sad violins, check. Bottom line is that the movie is two hours too long. It's boring, really boring, with uninteresting characters, bad writing, and a paper thin plot. Just fast forward till you see an explosion or robots fighting and watch those parts. Should only take you half an hour. Better yet, don't buy or rent this movie so they will give the Transformers license that can actually direct.",1317600000,,1101,4.830687830687831

I felt whatever problems Megan Fox and the Director had, should have been placed aside and she should have been in this movie. If at all else maybe Sam shouldn't of had a girlfriend at all. I thought the actress in this movie did ok, but should not have been added to replace Megan Fox.
I noticed how they didn't even mention ""Makayla"" in this film. I suppose then they wouldn't have to compensate her for anything.
Some of the scenes left you thinking is it done yet or really, this is so fake...
Please, I hope this will finish it up or if you would make another one bring back Megan Fox and have the other girl be a Decepticon with Sam and Makayla getting back together... That would fix all, Oh and bring back Iron Hide!

I had ready plenty of reviews that said this was the best Transformers movie ever or at least that it was better then the last one.  Frankly, I am not sure what is different in this one that than the last one (2nd).  I will state:  I never watched the cartoon; I really enjoyed the first movie.  The story had a pretty good setup, but by the end I didn't care and just wanted the movie to be over.

The video quality on the disc is top-notch and the 7.1 sound was terrific on my 120"" scope/ 7.1 system.  I always like to see the subtitles in the picture (due to my constant in height setup).  I heard great directionality.  I saw no artifacts or any video problems.  Could easily be a demo disc for sound and audio.

As far as extras, this disc has none (probably why the video looks so good from a compression standpoint).  I can't seem to find time to watch all of the movies I want to, much less the extras.

It keeps things going with over dramatized lame acting, a vague storyline with very little interesting, and hard to follow even if there is something there to follow, even my wife said ""that does not make sense"" ""so much is not believable, even stupid"" (my wife never talks like that), and so much busy, loud and fast special effects action to keep your brain overloaded/confused so it cannot tell these many downfalls.

Leonard Nimoy voice is too well known from Star Trek (and many other appearances) and with just coming back in the last Star Trek of 2009, he cannot be something else, just too weird, messes it up big time!  The only thing enjoyable, fun or interesting, the (now) 2  little pet robots (where did the second one come from? no idea, my point with the movie all through it, rambles meaninglessly), they are funny and the only believable heroes in it (other than their sort-of cut short swear words when they commandeer a space ship, but decency and any level of good practice or censorship left years ago)!

Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie.  It would have been better without her all together.  And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox.  I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste.  Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program.  It would have been better as a cartoon.  If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it.  This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.

I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.

The story starts with an alternate history of the moon landing with an alien discovery twist and moves on to become a fast-paced action movie with the familiar heroes except for one, a new romantic interest. The new romantic interest, played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fails to measure up to the previous one played by Megan Fox.

The sound and video are both first rate and will rattle your rafters if you crank up the sound high enough. The story line holds ones interest and provides enough surprise elements to keep one guessing. This is a worthy addition to the franchise and a keeper for any collector of this genre.

4318406,5,B004BDOEZO,"I was so excited when I recieved the movie only 2 days after being told it had been shipped, and 2 days before it was estimated to get here. Insert dorky happy dance. I of course watched the movie right away and was completely stunned by the special effects. The other two movies had pretty awesome FX, but this movie topped them both. And there was just enough humor mixed in with all the action, I love how Bay makes it so you're one minute you're freaking out thinking a main characters going to die, and then the next you're laughing like crazy. Shia Labeouf contributed to that a lot, he's hilarious.
The only thing I had a problem movie-wise was a couple of new characters I didn't recognize. I don't know how many people are familiar with the original cartoon, or any of the others they made after that, but I'll admit that I am and I haven't heard of Que or Dino and some of the others before. Not that I didn't like the characters, I just don't understand why they had to make some of them up when they literally have probably hundreds of originals to choose from (And they had Sideswipe but no Sunstreaker, how weird is that?).
About the actual DVD though, I was disappointed in the lack of bonus features. I guess they're now charging us extra for that, too. Amazon needs to put in their product description that there are none on this DVD, so customers know ahead of time instead of popping the disc into their DVD player and being disappointed.
All in all, awesome movie, excellent shipping, not too bad a price either. I'm happy with my purchase:)",1317513600,2,1561,4.442508710801394
4318407,5,B004BDOEZO,"Just got this movie the other day.  I had enjoyed it so much in the movie theater this summer--I couldn't wait to get it home and play it on my own big screen LED (which IMO delivers much more clarity and pop then the high-tech/Digital large cinema screens) and my 5.1 surround sound system.  Transformers: Dark of the Moon 2D Blu-ray video, audio, and surround sound effects did not disappoint.  I highly recommend this movie as one of the best thrill-ride movies out of the summer 2011 lineup for your home library.

However, be warned this movie is rather sparse on ""plot"" and ""story line""( It didn't go over well with the majority of critics).  IMO this movie is more about crazy, over-the-top audio and visual special effects aka, F-U-N.

My only disappointment is that the 3D version is not yet for sale for some reason.  However, my package came with a $10 off coupon for whenever the 3D version comes out.  I'll reserve my opinion/comments on this tactic until I see how much it might cost me to purchase the 3D version using this enclosed $10 coupon) Until then, I'll just use the 2d-3d conversion button on my TV when I want to see this $19.99 2D movie in 3D.",1317513600,2,1169,4.507109004739337
4318408,5,B004BDOEZO,"You know going in what you are going to get with a Michael Bay flick....lots of explosions and copious hot chick butt shots. You certainly get that here. However, it does seem like he has taken the criticisms from the last two movies (and part 2 in particular) to heart. In this movie, you don't get lost in the combat scenes, for example. Also, where he went more Wild West for the battles, in this movie, the Transformers use more martial arts and medieval knight styles in the combat sequences. It worked quite well.
Emotionally, there was also more a draw in this movie. The comedic scenes were plentiful, and i laughed often throughout the movie. Also, when Ironhide dies, and when Bumblebee gets captured, you cant help but get a little choked up.
Megan Fox's replacement was equally hot, so no drop off there.

...and, much like the cartoons, while Megatron is a bad ass as a rule, he has moments where he seems quite frail. If you remember the old cartoons, there were moments of cowardice for him. Here, there arent, but there are moments of weakness.

I don't understand all the negative reviews here really. If you are expecting an oscar worthy movie, you shouldnt be watching this to begin with. If, however, you go in just expecting a fun and fast romp, i don't see how you could be disappointed. Also, for now at least, the reviews for the DVD.

My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.
Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.
Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.

The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information.",1317513600,3,1006,4.351063829787234

No extra disc with background information such as interviews, featurettes, deleted scenes, commentaries, bloopers, etc. No Digital Copy disc which is not necessarily a big deal but downloading a 2.24GB file is a bit too much for those of us with data caps from our internet providers (40GB in my case).

The first one was... okay, the second horrid and this, the third in the trilogy is a grand failure. Yes, the effects and battles are stunning, no issues there, but if that is all a movie is -is just effects and battles then what do we have? Michael Bay is known for his big budget stunners but this movie, though visually stunning was just boring.

I love how they tied in the Space Race of the 60's to the Transformer Mythology and I thought ""okay, good premise"" but after a half hour it just grew gruesomely tiresome. The parents make a couple of quick scenes, adding nothing but a comedic release, the new girl -whatever her name is, looks more fake and plastic (and acts that way too) than Megan Fox.

The movie was too much to absorb -the effects were hard to take in -which shows the level of detail given to them. Again, they are stunning but that's all there is. The acting is horrendous, the intros of past characters a waste, the sub-plots went nowhere -the movie didn't hold my attention.

I love effects based movies -really. I remember when ""Independence Day"" came out in '96 -back then that was a big deal but it had heart and humor. Even ""Armageddon"" -one of Bay's other movies from '98 had more heart and development than this. If you're a total geek (or 12) you'll love this -if you have any taste, rent it and watch it once.

The movie went down in price so I got $5 bucks back and I also got the movie delivered personally to me by an agent on the day before it was released (Sep. 29th) so BIG points for that. The disc case comes in a nice looking shielded cover and the product itself includes a Blu-Ray copy, DVD version and a code for a digital version copy which you can get on the website somehow which I haven't tried yet. The movie is beautiful Hi-Def which you would expect from any Blu-Ray movie, which is a real treat in this one when the sparks start flying(and there are many sparks).

The Movie itself should be viewed only as a blockbuster summer flick for entertainment purposes only. If you haven't watched this movie yet and are expecting it to be good then you will be utterly dissapointed. This movie has terrible story(tho not as bad as the second one), mediocre acting and the dialogue/humor sometimes is a little awkward and embarrassing(like almost any Michael Bay film these days). The action is great and intense just don't expect good deaths for the bad guys given almost all of them have a very stupid/pathetic death scene given to them regardless of how badass they are in the movie. Megatron, despite how badass he's supposed to be, is punked and pushed around the entire film and not given a proper death. Basically the movie feels a little rushed towards the end and the ending doesnt really feel like an ending more like they just wanted to finish the damm thing already.

Oh and for the idiot people complaining this movie isn't the extended edition and rating it down because of it, learn to read. This is the version that was in theaters not a special edition but I will have to agree with the people complaining about the lack of extras in this disc. There are NONE, which is stupid but then again I got this product for the movie itself not to see how they made the damm thing so I got what I expected.

4318428,1,B004BDOEZO,"Sorry with my english for i am from Montral.

I still do not want to give up on Michael Bay. When i see him in interviews, underneath his condescending tone and his obvious self-love, i see an educated and intelligent man. I still have hope that he will mature eventually and direct a genuine great film. But right now, he is a teenager. He obviously thinks that most of his audience is dumb, sexually depraved and uneducated. The way he films women, the way he portrays the adults, the things he makes them say and do, the ""comedy"" that he puts in there and that he thinks will make us laugh, all of this makes me think that Michael Bay simply sees his fans as cavemen. And by reading some of the comments here, well my God, he's about right!

It is not a question of putting your brain to neutral in order to enjoy a good old ""pop corn"" movie. Not all ""pop corn"" movies are good. ""Transformers 3"" is a bad movie. Just like the second one. Probably even more. The characters are stupid. The dialog is corny. The intentions are childish. And we just don't care about anything. And why, oh why, do incredible and sexy women fall so much in love with Sam? It is so obvious that Bay was a shy and rejected teenager and that he couldn't get... well, nevermind. I don't know how Michael Bay and his team can watch a movie like that knowing that other people will witness such a disgraceful work of art. How can they be proud?

God knows i enjoy all sort of films. Pop corn movies and art films. I loved the first ""Transformers"". But it is clear to me now that Steven Spielberg had more of a word to say in the first one.

And when i hear people calling this third film ""Excellent"" or ""Perfect""... it's beyond me.

The first part of the film, the prologue that is, when it deals with the missions on the Moon, well that part is truly fun. Those small parts are the ones that make me think that Bay will, one day, make a great ""Pop Corn"" movie. But the more i see him going and the more i hear him talk, i'm starting to think that he won't be able to do it on his own, that he'll need someone else to help him along the way, like Spielberg in the first ""Transformers"".

Again, i'm all for ""Pop Corn"" movies. I enjoy them. But the directors must respect the viewer's intelligence. Michael Bay does not. He is clearly saying that you are dumb. And some of you are worshiping him.

Michael Bay took a different approach with Transformers: Dark of the Moon than he did with the previous two and gave us a movie that is so adrenaline filled that it'll leave you pretty tired after you watch it. The action happens pretty much in every frame. Not only that but The Transformers themselves pretty much take center stage in the film as you see them alot more in this movie.

I personally loved the movie and love the direction that Michael Bay took with this one. It's played in a more serious tone as it should be. If serious Transformer fans don't like this movie, then- something is seriously wrong.",1317427200,,795,4.638297872340425
4318431,1,B004BDOEZO,"Being curious about the current 'state of the arts in Hollywood' is possibly an acceptable reason for viewing this grueling 2 1/2 hour + mechanical mishmash, but after enduring the storyless CGI exercise in visual and auditory assault the viewer can only hope that in the theaters, with the added dimension of 3D to the soup, the film might have had some saving graces.

Apparently the 'story' goes something like this (at least in a neutral writer's words): 'Autobots Bummblebee, Rachet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons, who are eager to avenge their recent defeat. The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets, and once again Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. New villain, Shockwave, who rules Cybertron, is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth.' In other words this is an action film where the main characters are expanding and imploding auto parts in some semblance of a battle for taking over the earth.  What little dialogue there is was written by Ehren Kruger and the comic book cum video game cum 3D epic was 'directed' by Michael Bay.

Given that the film did so well in the theaters (likely due to the novelty of 3D) it made a lot of money.  The cast assembled is an admirable one: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich (for his brief few seconds on screen), Ken Takemoto ,  and the voices of the mechanical dolls supplied by such actors as Hugo Weaving, Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy,  Robert Foxworth,  James Remar, and Francesco Quinn.  The problem is that there is so much destruction of the city of Chicago and the flying pieces of the fighting Autobots and Decepticons that finding a story and caring about the non-mechanical actors is tough.  But then this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this.  Could there possibly be another installment coming?  Probably.....

The first Transformers did a pretty good job. It has a great cast, great production value, a gripping score, and even a little humor. It's innocent enough that you feel for the character of Sam Witwicky, realize the scope of the Autobot/Decepticon war coming to earth, then get to watch it all unfold as a grand and adventurous sci-fi actioner. Revenge of the Fallen.. not so much. It takes the nobility out of Optimus Prime's character, overshadows the plot with a little too much juvenile humor, one-liners, and situational comedy for my tastes, then tries to go beyond the conventions of sci-fi by making a ""heaven for robots,"" while also making its female lead completely infallible to makeup discrepancies, then decides to ghetto-fies its robot cast by adding two inadvertently segregating ""black"" twin robots, and even flashes the movie-goers with John Toturo's ass in a jock strap (not a pretty sight). So yes; a writer's strike, no story or script, and only a year to shoot set the movie franchise back a bit (at least from a fanbase perspective). Thankfully, though, Dark of the Moon makes up for it, even surpassing TF1 in terms of character development, overall scope, and of course, brevity of action. For the writing, I enjoyed three particular elements: the ambition and search for self-worth of Sam's character, the more gritty and no-holds-barred nature of the storytelling, and the downright sense of treachery that seemed to loom throughout many of the characters. We see Sam yearning to feel useful and finding a purpose in life. He can't a find a job despite saving the world twice already, but at the same time knows he's capable of so much more than the office job he ends up with. His new girlfriend doesn't want him to be as ambitious because she feels that same kind of ambition is what got her bother killed in the military. Yes, the first half of the film is about as ""fluffy"" in spirit as the first two, but the overall structure is much less comedic than the former and substitutes it with a more epic story and darker tone in the second half. People and robots are killed, betrayal runs amok, and total kinetic action ensues for pretty much the entire duration of the movie thereafter. It's escapist sci-fi robot fantasy at its best that's a technical marvel, wonderfully choreographed, and everything one could hope for in a Michael Bay film.

Prior to this BD release I'd only seen Dark of the Moon in 3D in theaters (and 3 times, to boot). If the 3D was that impressive, I'm sure a 2D BD presentation would've been just as stellar as the previous entries, and boy is it. They really went all out in filming this using 6 different cameras, 4 types of film negatives, and another 6 types of cinematographic processes ranging between 35mm, digital, and 3D dual-strip. While TF2 barely accomplished anything with its crappy IMAX sequences (not crap in the sense of quality, but the fact that there was just so little of it), TF3 has some amazing cinematography in general, whether it be 2D or 3D. As far as the 2D presentation goes it's as demo-worthy as you can get. The CG and visual effects in particular are pristine and flawless in terms of detail and clarity. All the lines in the robotic parts, scuffs in peoples' faces, stubble on their chins, tiny bits of debris falling from the sky, sparks ricocheting off of exploding structures, water droplets from splashes, steam and smoke from fired weapons, everything is perfectly visible from any given angle under every kind of lighting imaginable. Blacks and contrast are the biggest draw for me revealing lots of fine texturing in the production design, while colors are very vibrant, particularly in opposition to the grittier look of the second half of the movie. There's hardly any noise to speak of aside from maybe a couple of dark shots filmed in 35mm. Everything has either a clean digital sheen or a fine layer of film grain. There's no over-saturation of colors, no noise reduction, edge enhancement, banding, or any of those detracting elements that may otherwise bog the video presentation. My favorite scenes for demo material would be the part where Sam meets Dylan for the first time (for a good contrast of colors with the least bit of CG) and, of course, any part of that massive last hour where they're fighting the Decepticons in Chicago (for a great mix of real and CG-integrated footage). I know the Oscar committee hates Michael Bay and are all about politics, but a film as technically sound as this needs to win an award at least for something like cinematography, visual effects, or editing.

Well, so much for Thor being my (previous) number one loudest BD (after its two-week reign). First, I want to address the supposed controversy about the use of a TrueHD encode. Yes, while TrueHD may be have the lowest bit rates of the three lossless codecs, it also takes up the least amount of disc space. I believe the reasoning behind this logic is because 1) it's still lossless; even TF1 has TrueHD and many people still refer to it as one of the premier demo discs, 2) not only does it still sound awesome, but it's even 7.1 to compensate for the fact that it is TrueHD in the first place, which if you consider TF1 to be pretty good, then this is even better, and 3) they need the extra space for the eventual 3D version which will surely take up more disc space, so instead of barely being able to fit a two and a half-hour movie in 3D AND with lossless audio without suffering possible compression issues, you do the math and tell me otherwise. Not to mention this disc already supports 3 other spoken languages in Dolby Digital 5.1 (again, more disc space). Now, as for the audio presentation itself, it should be a no-brainer. Greg P. Russell returns as re-recording mixer for, yet another, truly wonderful auditory experience. The guy has worked on all 3 Transformers films and 200 films altogether in his illustrious career. He's been nominated for 14 Oscars but hasn't won any because, again, the Oscar committee is full of pretentious sycophants that just won't give mainstream movies the credit they're due, let alone anything Michael Bay is a part of. Needless to say, this easily one of the finest presentations you'll hear on a BD. Dialogue remains clear from the center channel, even throughout the chaotic battle sequences, high and low ends are pitch-for-pitch perfect, directionality and separation are flawless from the remaining fronts, sides, and backs, and, of course, LFEs are expectedly ground-shaking. Specifically, the score by Steve Jablonsky is very fitting for the film. It works something to the affect of Hans Zimmer's work in The Dark Knight and Inception giving a very emotional feel to the happenings on screen. But it's to be expected since Jablonsky is a disciple of his. My favorite scenes: the highway chase when Bumblebee transforms in mid-air to catch Sam and the part where they fight Shockwave. Oscar committee, please be more open-minded and at least give Mr. Russell is much-deserved award.

Extras - 0.5

There's nothing here, of course, as they're pulling off an Avatar and trying to capitalize as fast as they can. But at least Paramount gave early warning. I'm sure the eventual deluxe package will have the usual commentary and 2+ hours of special features on a separate disc when it comes out. As much work as they put into this, I'm actually very eager to see how they did it.

Overall - 4.0

Based on the average scores and whether or not you even care for extras (or even 3D) this could either be a ""buy now"" or ""buy it later"" recommendation. I, for one, love special features in general and will gladly wait for a complete package. Those who don't mind a bare bones release, however, shouldn't hesitate to get this. This is easily the best of the three Transformers films. It has a gradually building plot structure, a better balance of humor, amazing production value, and is overall a darker and more satisfying film altogether. And with equally amazing A/V quality, fans of the franchise will definitely be pleased.",1317427200,3,8474,4.772851296043656
4318446,5,B004BDOEZO,"The first Transformers movie was as good as it gets, or so we thought as the audience, the second was pretty good but still was missing something. Then came Dark Of The Moon. This movies special effects and story line says it all and is leaving the audience saying well whats next. SPOILER ALERT, well since Megatron, Starscream, and Sentinel are all dead wats next. I don't know what the studio is planning on coming up with but a BILLION dollars richer may change the way they think about making another one even though they said they weren't. I predict there will be another three movies so they make it a saga, but who will star in it and who will direct it? But as long as u have Optimus, my man B, and the rest of the gang you cant go wrong.

The fantasy is a little too  fantastical.  The action not quite up to snuff.  The new girlfriend has the eye candy on her side, but the mystique is missing.  The returning characters did their part in upholding the imagination of the film.  I did not see this in the theater, thank goodness.

But For some reason everyone say's Rosie is a terrible actress, Personally myself I loved her in this not only because she was smoking (I'm a straight girl btw) but because I just loved the personality that she brought to the screen she made it sexy and just empowered. I loved, the CGI, all the effects are beyond amazing. I like that they used flashbacks of president Kennedy that was really awesome. I would recomend this if you have the time cuddle up and watch this. When I was watching it, time flew by it truly just caught me in, A little towards the end maybe 45 mins or so I got a little distracted with other things it started to just get a little predictable, But overall This movie was amazing :) I'd def. watch it again not only for Rosie but for the amazing actors.

One heads up for those who want to buy this now but also want the special features addition is that this version comes with a $10 coupon insert to be used for the special features addition that releases later this year. The movie is completely brilliant in the blu ray format, well worth buying. The 20 to 25 dollar price range that you can find this movie for is more than acceptable considering it comes with the movie in 3 different formats. Up to this point amazon provides the best market price I have for the movie although Best Buy is pretty close too. Don't miss out on the ""Now"" by waiting for the special features addition, just buy this one, enjoy it and save up for the next release and take advantage of the $10 coupon this one comes with.

4318457,5,B004BDOEZO,"I've been into director's commentaries and making of featurettes since they first started coming out on DVD's in the late 90's (The Matrix and Wargames come to mind for excellent commentaries).  I've found that there is diminishing returns on these.

Pretty much all the featurettes are worthless for new movies.  Actors running around in front of blue/green screens and graphic artists sitting in front of computers are pretty much all the same.  It's mostly boring stuff that might be watched once. They were cool when DVD was new and this stuff was fresh.  But now, except for the true classics (original Star Wars trilogy), aren't even worth the time to watch.  Transformers isn't going to have anything worth the time to even surf through.  I've seen the features on the first two movies deluxe sets and they weren't anything worth watching.

As for commentaries, these are sometimes very good.  But this is only true for certain directors/producers for certain types of material (Donnie Darko for instance, Zack Snider also does a good job).  Michael Bay's commentaries are generally worthless, where he just comments on how he likes some scene or how something looks totally awesome.  Really, who cares, so he liked his own movie.

Basically, this blu-ray has great picture and sound.  That's all that people on the whole really want for this release.  There isn't going to be some extended release later, so this isn't Avatar or Lord of the Rings ""bare bones.""  This is the movie.

So go buy it if you like big popcorn action/sci-fi, it's a decent film, with spectacular special effects.  I strongly doubt any of the rumored future versions with special features will add much of value.  What they will have is a higher price tag.",1317340800,7,1738,4.8938356164383565
4318458,3,B004BDOEZO,"While the Autobots are out saving the world along side the US military on a daily basis, Sam Witwicky is unemployed. But on their latest assignment to Chernobyl, Optimus Prime discovers that the US government has been keeping a big secret. Back when man first stepped foot on the moon, they uncovered the wreckage of an alien ship that came from the Autobots home planet. And as Sam soon learns, the Decepticons are on the move.

Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is still the same loveable geek, but now has a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Apparently dumped by his former, Sam somehow got an even hotter girlfriend who lets his unemployed self live and mooch off of her. This seems more improbable than intelligent machines from another planet coming to Earth. Unsurprisingly, Michael bay introduces the eventual damsel-in-distress by an eye-rolling, long, spray-tanned butt shot. Several other characters return for this latest adventure: John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. John Turturro is again fantastic, and brings the laughs along with Alan Tudyk, who plays his assistant. I only wish the two of them had more scenes, as they made the film bearable in between the suspense and action sequences. And to show that Michael Bay isn't a complete chauvinist, the boss in charge of the Autobots and military base is played by Frances McDormand, a tough-as-nails, female leader. And brief appearances by John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are silly and surprisingly fun. Throw in Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime with an all-too familiar Spock line, and this Star Trek fan was happy.

Thankfully, the story and action scenes more than make up for the second lackluster installment in the Transformers saga. My favorite scenes were of cleverly cut shots of the original lunar landing, with computerizes cameos of John F. Kennedy, and blending the top secret mission to the dark side of the moon. The story was pretty great and easy to follow, along with the action scenes being smoother. You can actually tell who's who. It's everything a summer blockbuster should be - action-packed, fun, with plenty of surprises. Its faults were easy enough to look over in favor of new characters, a strong story, and fantastic special effects.",1317340800,,2242,5.056756756756757

Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing.

The plot was ridiculous with awkward, lame attempts at comedy throughout the movie and I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters. Very weak story telling. It's a lot of boom, crash, explosions, wrapped around a stupid story line that requires you to leave your brain at the door. And if that doesn't make you want to run out screaming from this movie, maybe having to look at that perpetual duckfaced girl throughout the movie might. I almost turned this movie off about half way though because it's so boring, but I stuck it out. Hopefully, this is the last Transformers movie they make.

4318493,2,B004BDOEZO,"EDIT: If there's one good thing about this movie...Scott Krinsky makes a cameo! Yay!

So there's this one part where the Autobots get in a ship to leave Earth at the demand of the Decepticons, to avoid a war. But as the ship is leaving, the Decepticons destroy it. Oh noes! The Decepticons destroy most of Chicago, killing a whole lot of people. But it turns out that the Autobots faked their death, they had never intended to leave! So all those deaths could have been prevented! They could have just fought the villains head-on! Wait...WTF?!

*Ahem*...Okay, so Dark of the Moon is the best Michael Bay Transformers movie so far. The dialogue is a bit better; there's nothing like the mind-numbingly bad college scenes or the character Leo Spitz from Revenge of the Fallen. The acting is a bit better; instead of Megan Fox we have Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who's actually pretty okay (there's this one part where she says that Megatron is a certain other robot's biatch...to his face!), and Shaia Labeouf is over the top in a way that's kinda convincing and seems to make sense for the Sam Witwicky character. There are less shenanigans; the movie is focused on its plot, knows what it's about. The cinematography is good; I could actually understand what was happening in the action scenes and there were some pretty cool shots of the sundered world. The 3D is good; especially the parts with Shockwave. And Megan Fox isn't in it.

So that's great and all, but here's a problem for you: I just didn't care. I mean I didn't care about anything that was going on in this movie. The Decepticons have yet another plan for world domination, and to beat them there's a lot of fighting to be done. Many Transformers die. But I didn't care about them, because they've never been able to develop personalities. Are you even keeping track of who these guys are? Starscream is never actually called by his name. Soundwave is in like, one scene. Say, was that Ratchet? I see grey parts flying in every direction, not the deaths of characters. One of the only Transformers I came to like was George Coe as Cue the Autobot scientist. The Human characters aren't any better, either.

Some of the action sequences drag on and on. The falling skyscraper part comes to mind. Then there's the part where Sam fights Starscream. There's such an insane amount of flailing metal in that one, it's hard to believe that the squishy little Human is still alive. But there are sections with Shockwave and the tentacle thing and parts where Optimus is flying that were great. Combined with the 3D, it really felt like you were zooming through the air.

By movie's end there has been so much destruction and so many Transformers have died that it's hard to see the series going on from here. And nothing very special happend over the course of the film (like character development, closure to the series, etc.). Villains came, they saw, and they got their asses kicked. Yeah, it's hard to see the series going on, but it will. There's money to be made.

4318506,4,B004BDOEZO,"Optimus Prime and the Autobots are back in this third installation of Transformers.  I am hesitant to call this a trilogy as each story-line fails to support a continuance of the previous.  Nonetheless, this was a far better movie than the second.  The effects in this film are second to none; I have watched this film in HD as well as 3D and was definitely pleased.
The story is self-contained.  The Autobots, losing a war on Cybertron, attempt an escape with valuable technology that could change the war in their favor.  The Autobot vessel crash lands on the moon, and this in effect starts a space race between the US and the Russians.  A space race that abruptly ends without any real explanation (the reason behind Chernobyl was also a nice touch).  Unfortunately, betrayal changes the fates of many and is the cause for the loss of a comrade.  In the meantime, despite graduating from an ivy league school and receiving a medal from Obama himself, Sam (like most Americans today) struggles to find a job, and is caught between his new love and trying to prove his self-importance.
If you view this movie through the eyes of a 10 year old, you can ignore minor details like the Matrix of Leadership (wasn't that destroyed in the second movie by Prime himself) and since when did Decepticons bleed or were torn apart so easily.  This movie was meant to be enjoyed as an action-packed flick and in action, it did not disappoint.  The accompanying music was great, Linkin Park was brought in again, this time with 'Iridescent' as well as other artists.  The freeway scene about an hour into the movie was one of my favorites.  The new Autobots were refreshing (I like Dino); and nothing against General Motors, but it was nice to see other nameplates (Dodge and Mercedes) in the movie, though I did miss the other two Chevys, Mudflap and Skids.
Though a bit lacking in story/plot, this film made up for it in action, script, special effects and acting.  Sam and his parents had me laughing a lot, Simmons and Dutch are an awesome duo, and Charlotte Merring (Director of Intelligence and Simmons' ex-girl) was just too real a character.  All the actors deserve their praise.  They did a great job.  I definitely would recommend this movie (especially in Blu-Ray).",1316649600,,2265,4.710659898477157

4318508,1,B004BDOEZO,"How could anyone watch any of these Transformers movies and consider them to be anything but garbage of the lowest order? Michael Bay is without a doubt a brainless juvenile delinquent. Bayformers 3 might not be filled with as much cross burning racism and military propaganda as part 2, but it's still an insultingly stupid movie. Now, I know this is based on a cartoon about robots that turn into vehicles, but Thor/X-Men: First Class/Captain America were based on comic books and all three of those movies were very well made for the types of films that they were. Popcorn movies don't have to be dumb and when audiences flock to see crap like Bayformers they're practically paying to be treated as though they were mentally deficient.

Michael Bay's Transformers movies are to Science Fiction as the Twilight movies are to the Horror genre and it's truly sad to see that both franchises have made soo much money as it proves that I.Q.'s are dropping across the board. Bayformers is to cinema what The Jersey Shore is to television as Justin Bieber is to music; the lowest common denominator.",1316649600,27,1095,4.7936507936507935

4318512,5,B004BDOEZO,Transformers: dark of the moon took a more serious tone this time around and it was effective. There were scenes in the film when a decepticon would go after citizens and sending them to their death. The story behind NASA and the continuing battle between decepticons and the autobots were great and kept you interested. A few twists here and there gave the film the suspense building up to the climatic ending. The final hour of the film was filled with action and explosions. I felt the ending was a little too quick with the battle between Megatron and Optimus Prime and also the ending itself. I would definitly recommend this film to anyone who is into the transformers films.,1316044800,2,681,4.683333333333334

4318515,5,B004BDOEZO,"Thing is, should this be a review for the movie, or review for the home version and it's missing contents?  That is the question.  I'm giving this 5 stars for the movie alone, which was wonderful, just a bit long.  Now I read the novel first, I wish I hadn't.  The novel was great, and the movie follows the books to a ""T"".  We follow the wanna-be conspiracy with what's on the other side of the moon, Prime's anger over this, and Sam's story following the human interaction and deaths behind what the artifacts on the moon.  We can't have Transformers without Decepticons working with a few humans.  Where is Dr. Arkevil when you need him, eh Starscream?  Thing is, this movie is right up every Transformer fan who knows the G1 stories inside and out.  The movie weaves the basic stories behind ""More than meets the eye"" and ""Megatron's Master Plan"" perfectly.  Funny thing is, in the cartoon, Megatron simply ""lifted"" Lincoln of his memorial and sat down in one of the old episodes...not this new Megatron!  We finally see some new Transformer characters brought from the woodworks out of history from Sentinel Prime, Shockwave, and Laserbeak(who nearly steals the movie, in my opinion).

Plenty of action, and comedy, with enough seriousness that makes you think... how ARE they going to end this?  Though we DO see the Twins in background of one scene and their ""death scene"" from the novel is oddly missing, while many either hate or love the Twins, they should have finished the scene or left it in.  That part really ""redeems"" those characters for me (still like their fight against Devastator from the previous movie...).  While the action is intense, the military does an amazing job (again!) you just can't go wrong with the third installment.  A lot of bang for your dollar here.  The plot is fleshed out, where everything makes sense.  A few twists here and there, whether they are unpredictable or very predictable.  Many salutes to various G1 references all over the movie.  As I own the BluRay version, the quality is very nice and crisp.  Everything looks as real as it did in theater digitally.  A movie I'll watch over and over.

Great movie, the 3D version is out now(still don't have it), but the BluRay standard does come with a $10 coupon good for many months for the 3D version if you want to upgrade!  I really don't want the 3D(yet), but when you buy DVD or BluRay you do expect extras, and there are none here.  That was HOW the DVD market was originally handled when DVDs were even released originally over a decade ago, and we're left with a great movie release with no extras?  I don't think so.  3.5 stars for the product, 5 stars for the movie.  They are milking it for all it's worth in an economy that's still hurting.

4318534,2,B004BDOEZO,"First off, DIE HARD Transformers fan.

First transformers movie from a character development, plot, story telling and CGI standpoint one of the best movies in last 10 years for the genre.

Second one lacked many of those facets as the first had, but still produced a quality albeit flawed story.  Plus the action was better.

Third one lacked nearly any character development, story was poorly told with huge plot holes within the movie itself (not to mention tying any consistency with the previous two).

The action scene was almost to long while being non-linear and really not very epic.  Basically you sit through an hour and half of some comedic wit, tons of useless cameos, and watch Sam whine about how much his life sucks.  Also Michael Bay fails miserably in replacing Megan Fox.  I am not a huge fan of her as an actress but I found myself rooting for the decepticons to kill her replacement off often but to no avail.

Finally ""Spoiler alert""
We are to believe that this advanced alien race takes over the city of Chicago, and the primary reason they do this is to enslave mankind to rebuild their home world.  Yet in order to do this they go on a killing spree reminiscent of Mars Attacks on the city.  I don't know about you, but if the Egyptians had vaporized their slaves those pyramids would not have been built as quick...  Then we are forced to watch a movie called ""Transformers"" show us the epic struggle of mankind for another 30 minutes while a building is falling (physics and common sense aside).  Finally to have mankind's struggle really mean nothing when Optimus just owns everyone with a splash of help from Megatron.  Then the movie just ends...  Thats it, no closure, don't bother to tie any plot strings together let alone insert a plot.

I give the movie 2 stars to be generous because as I said, I am a Die Hard Transformers fan.  But this movie was a greater disappointment then Green Latern and superman returns combined in my humble opinion.",1315094400,9,1978,4.621776504297994
4318535,5,B004BDOEZO,"As a fairly new fan of the ""Transformers"" fandom, I eagerly watched one and two before going to see the third.  I found the first one extremely enjoyable, but absolutely hated the second. I see how the story was necessary to set up the third, but the rather painful quality of two made me somewhat apprehensive going into the third.

The first thing that struck me about the third was the opening sequences. The space race between the US and the Soviet Union has always fascinated me, and seeing the story opened with footage about it to introduce the ""dark of the moon"" made my expectations take a very large leap. I was extremely excited to see where the movie went next.

I knew that Megan Fox's character had been replaced, which I admit made me happy. I never liked Mikeala, but I did very much like Carly.  She was engaging, strong without being overbearing, and (in my opinion) far prettier and more suited to Sam's character. The actress did seem a little wooden in spots, but once she found her footing in the story and with her co-star, she did an excellent job integrating herself into an established universe. The movie also gave a believable reason for Mikaela's absence without slowing down the story.

Another thing that I enjoyed about the third movie more than one or two was the fact that there seemed to be an actual storyline, and they stuck through it. You could tell that the movie was driving itself toward an ultimate point, and though the special effects were just as spectacular as the others (perhaps even better!), it was not the focal point of the movie. It complimented the plot, instead of overpowering it. Also introduced in this movie was the autobot who was at one time Optimus Prime's mentor, voiced by Leonard Nimoy. It was quite fascinating to see the character who shaped Optimus and turned him into the autobot that he was throughout the first two movies, and into this one. The movie also kept up the humor throughout, which at some points was direly needed since ""Dark of the Moon"" has a darker and more serious tone than the preceding two. The plot of the third movie was also able to stand somewhat on its own, though familiarity with the first two movies made it clear to see how events in them were making those in the third bring everything together in a climax that was truly breathtaking.

The final thing that made this movie truly enjoyable was the score.  The first two had wonderful pieces of music, but on the whole ""Dark of the Moon"" far outshone the other two. The score could stand on its own, but at the same time it complimented the movie and enhanced the action and romantic scenes. The music told a story of its own, weaving deeper emotions into those already evoked by what was happening on screen.

4318538,5,B004BDOEZO,"Did we watch the same movie??!

When you consider the mindless dribble that passes for TV these days (which caused many of us to run not walk to cancel our cable service) and compare that against a contemporary America filled with 304 million plus half-wits, each of which is thoroughly convinced that they are intellectually superior over every other, I suppose these critiques shouldn't surprise me.  I thought these movies were excellent.  I know some of you just go because you like the pretty flickering lights, yet are easily frightened and confused, and others only go so they can bash the film after words, calling into perspective the stupidity of seeing a film and two sequels you obviously didn't care for on the conceptual level.  However, for some of us, not all movies have to be critically acclaimed Brokeback Mountain archetypes (which, since it didn't appeal to me to watch a story about gay cowboys, I simply didn't watch it, see how that works, it's easy).  Some movies can just be entertaining, and this movie, like its two predecessors delivered that in spades.

The movie is relevant, and for those of you who are dribbling a bit while reading this, that means it addresses current issues in subtle ways.  It addresses in a slightly comedic fashion just how ""perfect"" we must be in order to survive and remain employed today.  How about it depicts how insane the ruling classes are; how self-involved and arrogant our leaders can be; how those charged with protecting the nation tend to abysmally fail us when they are faced with something important or worse, that every time they have to make a decision, it's usually the wrong one; how brave our soldiers can be given even a set of incredibly unlikely events (like being human and having to engage in close combat with a thirty foot tall robot); how brave we can all be if called upon to take action against those who threaten our values; how diabolical and two faced our pompous wealthy can be; how love STILL conquers all; how our allies can betray us; how greed is STILL wrong; how sometimes we have to do things we don't agree with to protect our loved ones...

The score (for those of you who actually pay attention to these things) is actually sortof an amalgam of the last two films, Batman Begins, and The Last of the Mohicans - Epic, and worth a once over at the least.  I don't care about who is who or who was the apprentice of who, for those who like to argue about such nonsense.  The score set the mood very well, and supplemented the flow of the film quite nicely.

I could go on and on, but frankly, I know I'm only going to be reaching those of you actually paid attention and enjoyed the movie anyway, as the rest of you Android's Dungeon Comic Book Guy wannabes started mentally retorting at line 3 and are just skimming to the end, looking to be offended, and waiting to blast this review (and frankly, if you are one of those people and are still reading this, thank you for proving my earlier point about morons who go to see movies they've already convinced themselves they won't like).  The rest of you already know what I'm talking about,  EXCELLENT film, hopefully not the last.  Excellent and very imaginative action sequences, inclusive of how things can just go wrong (like real life), stunning cinematography, amazing attention to the G1 series including elements of the Animated Movie (I'm still drawing a few of those parallels).  If you aren't anti-action films and aren't carrying a personal vendetta against Michael Bay, see this film...or don't.  It's not a life or death decision dude, it was just a killer movie.

4318543,3,B004BDOEZO,"The third installment of the ""Transformers"" franchise is certainly better than the second one - perhaps filmmakers had read complaints from fans on the net - but still not as good as the first one. Though most of the annoying characters of the second film are gone (well, not quite, but their roles are smaller), and the film has stunning visuals and several thrilling action sequences, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is still a disappointment to me. The reason is simple. We don't want silly jokes or an uninteresting love romance. We want transformers. Much more.

Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, who, having already saved the world more than once, is still looking for a job. OK, you may fast-forward this part of the story. Frankly, the film's earlier chapters about Sam's job interviews (or John Malkovich's eccentric employer) are dull and pointless. Ken Jeong (who looks as if reprising his character in ""The Hangover"") is just annoying. And ... where is Bumblebee?

The film gets better in the second half, where you finally get to see more battles involving Autobots and Decepticons. The combat action scenes are more intense and violent (with villainous robots killing civilians). The climactic battle sequence, often ignoring the laws of physics, is overlong with so many characters, but the special effects are impressive.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replacing Megan Fox plays Sam's new girlfriend Carly. That she is virtually an amateur does not matter as none of the human actors including overacting Frances McDormand and over-the-top John Turturro are particularly great anyway. What is more important is that we don't need the obligatory role of the hero's girlfriend from the beginning, especially when she is not particularly a likable person. Or do we really need Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky in the first place?

The script of the long and meandering film (157 minutes) is penned by Ehren Kruger, whose earlier works include ""Arlington Road,"" a much tighter and slicker thriller starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins. But I know this is a Michael Bay film. He is the guy who made ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor,"" action-packed blockbusters with big actions and weak romances. But what we need here is a simpler approach to making action films, focusing main characters and actions, as seen in ""The Rock"" and the first ""Transformer"" film.",1313625600,4,2364,5.116580310880829

Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is a massive overload of action. By now, at the third entry in the series, you should know how you feel about Michael Bay's Transformers series, and Michael Bay movies in general. If you love dumb action,  hot girls, and the best CGI that mankind has to offer, then you will love this movie. If you hated the last two, this one definitely won't change your mind.

The setup for the film can be summarized pretty quickly: the film recounts the War for Cybertron (pretty neat) and explains that there was an ulterior motive behind the space race of the 60's. There's even a CGI JFK, which lasted about 3 seconds but still was kinda cool. Flash-forward to present day, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is having a hard time finding a job after college (there are some funny scenes with Sam on interviews). Elsewhere, Lt. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the NEST team of Autobots are taking out the fledgling Decepticons. The bad guys rise up and invade Chicago, planning to take over Earth. Obviously Optimus Prime is pissed.

The battles in this movie are better directed and easier to follow than in Transformers or Revenge of the Fallen.  They can still get pretty hectic, but in general I could tell who was fighting who more often than not. The fights were also visually more interesting, with great choreography and CGI. I still can't get over, after three movies, how freaking real the robots look standing right next to the human characters. ILM did a fantastic job once again.

The movie is a tiny bit darker, but Bay exaggerated a bit about it. The Decepticons have some cool parts where they get to show how evil they are, such as a sequence when they kill off some of their human allies. I was surprised when they actually showed large groups of humans being exploded into nothing by Decepticons. Also, there is quite a bit of bad language in the movie. I felt a little weird being surrounded by kids and babies, and seeing gratuitous ass shots and violence and hearing much more expletives than in the previous films. I could care less, but parents should know that it does push its PG-13 rating a bit far.

Most of the old cast returns, like the previously mentioned Shia  and Josh, along with Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and the always funny Agent Simmons, played by John Turturro. There are a good amount of newcomers this time around. John Malkovich is one of Sam's eccentric bosses. Ken Jeong is one of his co-workers, who was funny at first but they played his part out far too quicly, and he became annoying. The same could be said of Alan Tudyk (Steve The Pirate!) in some weird gay German sidekick shtick to Simmons. Kevin Dunn and Julie White are back as Sam's sometimes funny, sometimes grating parents. Here they are mostly grating. Frances McDormand plays National Intelligence Director Mearing. Patrick Dempsey makes a heel turn as a too-nice-to-be-true boss, who quickly shows his evil side. As you can see, there are a lot of characters stuffed into this mammoth, 2.5 hour movie.

The characters you will see the most of are of course Sam, the awesome robots and Megan Fox's replacement, model-turned-actress (Slashie Award!) Rosie-Huntington-Whitely. She is OK for a first time-actress, but to be honest her sugar sweet attitude gets annoying by the end, and dare I say it, I missed Megan Fox a bit. I'm sure water cooler debate will wage for some time to come over who was hotter, and I'd have to give the edge to Megan. Also, even though there are giant robots doing battle on the streets of Chicago in this movie, the least believable thing has to be that Sam's character can continue to get these supermodel girls.

Now for the robots. Optimus Prime is as badass as he's ever been, with awesome battles worthy of him. He also gets to use his cool sword more in this movie, and even takes a giant robo-shotgun to another bots face. Megatron is back in a smaller role than usual, with a cool hoodie/cloak type thing and a badly destroyed body from the ROTF end battle. Starscream and Shockwave are sweet. Some of those tiny, goofy, comedy relief robots are back and annoying as usual. There are some more dumb looking Autobots this time, like an Autobot that looks like an old man, with gray hair and everything. Since when do robots grow old or have hair? It's really dumb, unnecessary, and when he dies a horrible death (not a spoiler, nobody cares about him) most of the audience laughed. Those two racist robots from ROTF are gone, thank God. Finally, Leonard Nimoy voices a robot called Sentinel Prime.

After the travesty that was Revenge of the Fallen, Michael Bay and company try to redeem themselves a bit with Dark of the Moon. They aren't completely successful, as the movie still falls into many of the traps the last two did, but it is the most fun Transformers movie since the first film. The movie is definitely too long, has too many goofy slapstick bits, and too many characters. But if you're willing to go in with an open mind (and switched-off brain) you will have fun.",1311552000,3,5077,4.636262513904338
4318558,1,B004BDOEZO,"I didn't think Michael Bay could make a Transformers movie worse than Revenge of the Fallen.

How I sat through this horrid mess called Dark of the Moon, I'll never understand. I think it may have been a case of brain rot. Or perhaps that is what I suffer from after sitting through this pathetic excuse for perverted boys.

Bay shows us that, with the final of his Transformers films, he really could care less for people who enjoyed the first movie. Everything about this last one spat in its face.

Add to that Leonard Nemoy adding his voice to a new transformer (quoting his oft-repeated line from Star Trek), a worthless acting performance by a Victoria Secrets model and you will have the essential Bay puke-fest.

You don't go see these movies for the story, I get that. But man - please give me something more than adolescent lusting and jokes.

This movie should have been a direct-to-DVD. The 3D that Bay initially hated, but then joyously embraced adds nothing to the experience. A James Cameron he is not. Not even close.

The original ""Transformers"" film was clearly a fluke.

After a lot of initial skepticism, I went to see the original ""Transformers"" film and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Funny characters, exciting action scenes, really cool special effects thrown into Michael Bay's blender to produce a very enjoyable summer movie experience. In the inevitable sequel, ""Revenge of the Fallen"", Bay heaps on the characters, the special effects, the so-called 'funny moments' and a particularly jarring Jar-Jar Binks-esque pair of characters to create a loud mishmash that completely loses any humanity, any character the first film has. So, when I heard they were doing a third ""Transformers"" film, the eternal optimist in me hoped that Bay would learn from the mistakes of the second film and create something closer to the first.

But he seems to consider the huge box office of ""Fallen"" as license for more of the same.

""Dark of the Moon"" begins with an interesting premise. The entire Apollo Space program was a ruse, a cover-up to get to the moon and find and investigate a strange space craft. The space craft crashed many years ago when Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) managed to escape the destruction of the Transformers home planet carrying precious cargo. The United States and Russia begin the Space Race to find out what crash landed on the moon. Flash forward to present day. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Carly (British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whitely) are living in Washington and Sam is trying to get a job. He is more than a little pissed that he helped to save humanity twice, but can't get a job. His parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) pop up for a surprise visit and Sam manages to get a job with an accounting firm run by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich). At the same time, Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is still running the unit with the Transformers, traveling around the world to put a stop to the various Decepticons. But Optimus Prime is concerned about Mearing's (Frances McDormand) handling of the unit. Then he begins to realize the Decepticons are about to try and retrieve the cargo Sentinel Prime has on his ship. They race to the moon and bring the dormant Transformer back. Eventually, the Opticons and the Decepticons begin to battle in Chicago. And Sam, Carly, Lennox and Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are all back in the center of the action.

""Dark of the Moon"" is a little better than the last film. And this can be contributed to the pretty impressive battle in Chicago, which closes the film. It also lasts a long time, making it a little more impressive and also a little excessive. But it is still fun nonetheless.

But let's talk more about that in a minute.

The best summer films contain the most interesting characters, the most interesting character development. Without believable, or at least interesting, characters, why should we care about all of the special effects, explosions, car chases, etc. In ""Dark of the Moon"", the actors seem to be in a contest to see who can out mug each other. Each actor creates a human cartoon character with broad gestures, bugged out eyes, flailing hands, and the like. And the winner of this contest would have to be Shia LaBeouf. He starts screaming at people and yelling and overacting for little or no reason. And he does this throughout the film, basically at the drop of a hat. The whole idea wears thin quickly. Basically, his performance is nothing like what an actual human would do in the same situations. John Malkovich is also so broad, his performance is almost unwatchable. Generally, Malkovich plays strange, unusual people, but Brazos is just a strange, strange creation. Worse it is difficult to figure out why he is acting like this. He doesn't really seem to be a part of the plot. Kevin Dunn and Julie White seem to be comic relief because they appear to be used simply to make Sam cringe and start yelling. Frances McDormand (really?) is also pretty bad, doing very little to create a believable persona. Patrick Dempsey pops up a few times. His performance only prompts me again to wonder why he is working with such a bad agent. After making such an impact in ""Grey's Anatomy"", Dempsey has appeared in a number of films and all but one has not provided him with the opportunity to create a memorable character. But the worst is easily Ken Jeong, who made such an impact in ""The Hangover"". Because of the success of that role, he seems to be getting additional work in which the filmmakers simply want him to recreate that character, only broader. Yikes. Broader than ""The Hangover""? In ""Dark of the Moon"", he never utters a word in anything that could be considered a normal voice. He is always yelling, whispering in a loud voice, flailing his arms, the like. Basically, it is a repeat of his performance in ""The Hangover 2"".

On the opposite side of the coin, Josh Duhamel seems to be in a different film altogether. If the other characters are broad and over-the-top, Lennox is downright sedate. He is always serious, always has an eye on the situation at hand. In other words, he is in an action film and tries to figure out how to get out of the situations created by the Transformers.

When the action shifts to Chicago and the Decepticons begin to put their plan into motion, the film picks up a bit. Maybe this is because everyone is running around and fighting and there simply isn't any time to try and act.

Why this battle takes place in Chicago is still lost on me. For some reason, the Decepticons have chosen to use Chicago as Ground Zero for their plan. Their plan is to use these machines to... Well, if that is really that important to you, you should find out what their plan is by watching the film. But why they choose Chicago is vague.

The climatic battle is long, a little excessive and fun to watch. It's even a little corny because the Decepticons raise the bridges completely hampers the progress of the humans and this becomes the main thrust of their efforts for a while. ""We have to get the bridges lowered"". People are trying to hack into computers, soldiers are trying to get close to auxiliary switches, everyone wants to get close to the bridges because ""We have to get the bridges lowered."" I guess they can't use boats, swim, use the El tunnels, get close enough to use missile launchers, etc.

Once the fighting gets under way, everyone gets together to come up with a plan. They have to take out a certain tower, because the Decepticons have set up this machine that will... Again, see the movie. But to take out this tower, they have to get close to the tower. How do you do that when all of the bridges are up? Well, they decide to do a dangerous sky dive. This is really the centerpiece of the entire sequence and it is pretty impressive. A large group of soldiers drops into the sky and flies towards their target, small wings attached between their arms and bodies. It is a visually stunning stunt and pretty exciting to watch. Bay seems to realize this because he includes the stunt twice. Normally, doing something twice in a row would point out the lack of original ideas, but I didn't care because it was fun to watch.

At one point, all of the humans are trying to get to a floor in the building directly across from the Decepticons machine. Apparently, they can only disable the machine by shooting at it in a straight line, directly across from it. The Decepticons learn they are in the building and send Shock Wave to take them out. Shock Wave is a large Transformer with large extensions, tentacles, that appear to extend from the main body and can wind and tunnel into anything, in a more fluid manner. Shock Wave is introduced early in the film, but the true terror of the Decepticon doesn't come into play until this sequence.

And it also provides an opportunity for Sam and Carly to get in the way of danger. Repeatedly. And it provides an opportunity for Sam to save his pouty lipped girlfriend more than once.

The most impressive thing about the ""Transformers"" films is the special effects. Sure, CGI can let most filmmakers accomplish some pretty impressive stuff, but when your special effects move as fast as the Transformers do, that adds another degree of difficulty, another degree of interest and it really holds your attention.

The least impressive thing about the ""Transformers"" films (and any Michael Bay film for that matter) is the acting. But in the first film, the acting seemed to be sweet, somewhat genuine and even a little plausible. Sure, there was a lot of shouting and John Turturro was pretty over-the-top, but these moments seemed justified by the unique nature of the threat. In ""Fallen"", the balance shifted and the acting grew exponentially cartoonish. In ""Dark of the Moon"", I can't say the acting has improved, in fact, I think Shia LaBeouf is even worse in this film, but the balance has shifted again, just slightly. The unique and interesting nature of the special effects and some of the action scenes outweighs the arm flailing and histrionics from Sam.

Based on the enormous success of this film, there will be a sequel. Yawn. I want to say I won't be in the theater, waiting to get my money's worth. But by that point, I probably will have bought into the hype again and parked my but in a seat on the aisle, waiting for the silver screen to come to life.",1311292800,10,9376,4.6658595641646485
4318560,3,B004BDOEZO,Pretty entertaining. Lots of things blow up. There is sort of a story - that makes no sense. The ending went on too long for my taste. Shia LeBoeuf pulls off running pretty good - he's up there with Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford in that aspect of physical acting. Plus they give him some decent lines to say. I think he's improving as an actor. Still he should stick with this franchise. Definitely better than Transformers #2. Ken Jeoung of Community (TV series) fame is absolutely hilarious in a bit role as an engineer with special knowlede of the Decepticon's plot.,1310860800,2,568,4.578431372549019

4318562,5,B004BDOEZO,"In 2007, executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Michael Bay delivered to audiences walking, talking, robots in disguise with ""Transformers"". The summer blockbuster took the box office by storm and raised the bar for visual effects extravaganzas at the movies.

Two years later, Spielberg and Bay did it again with the outstanding follow-up (although many would contest my usage of the word ""outstanding"" in regards to that film) ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". Once more this franchise blew away box office expectations and elevated the aforementioned bar even higher.

Now, here we are in 2011, and like clockwork a third Transformers film has arrived in theaters under the guidance of the previously mentioned executive producer and director. So, does ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" have what it takes to surpass its predecessors or do these robots in disguise need to go back to Cybertron?

""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" begins a few years after the last film as Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has graduated college, has a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), and is looking for a job. Meanwhile, the Autobots are still working alongside the U.S. government to protect the planet from future Decepticon attacks. However, the tide of war is about to change as the Decepticons are working to reassemble a recently discovered Cybertronian technology that could resurrect the long-dead planet of Cybertron and destroy the Earth in the process.

Regarding the question I asked a moment ago, whether or not this film has what it takes, the answer is an absolute ""YES"", without a doubt! If you were one of the moviegoers that felt disappointed by the last installment, this newest entry will easily erase any lingering ill will you may still be harboring towards this franchise.

Written by Ehren Kruger (the only returning screenwriter from the previous film), this film boasts the biggest story, the craziest action and visual effects to feast your eyes upon, and stakes that feel higher than ever before. Plus, the story actually strikes a few surprising emotional chords that I didn't expect; resulting in a movie that feels much more mature and grown up than the other installments.

The previous film, although I found to be enjoyable, many felt was inferior to the original by having a story that was overly convoluted and over-the-top. Personally, I disagree, but that was the major consensus, so I'm in the minority.

This newest movie boasts a much more streamlined plot that is more centralized and focused on a few major set pieces as opposed to the globe-trotting escapades of its predecessor. By taking this approach some might wonder if the final product seems scaled back by comparison.

The answer: yes and no.

In my opinion, the film feels easily as epic in scope as the previous one, in terms of the action on display and the threat being leveled by the Decepticons. But the main story does feel somewhat smaller, more inline with the original film. It sort of brings everything full circle, back to the basic concept of a young man thrust into an extraordinary situation.

Truth be told, I think this was the best approach for the movie. Reason being, since this is Bay's supposed last go-round with the franchise; the film serves as a very nice bookend to the story that began four years ago with the original.

Another area that became a bit smaller is the cast of Transformers in the film. Unlike the last entry, where the number of robot characters increased dramatically; this time around, the core group of Transformers is relatively the same size as the original movie, just with some new faces.

This more concise core cast of Transformers is a wise choice as it provides audiences a chance to get to know who these various robots are and see more of their distinct personalities on display. Thus, allowing us viewers to develop an emotional investment in them, so that they actually become real characters to us and not just CGI creations.

While the robot cast may have downsized a bit, the human cast of characters the story focuses upon is much larger than ever before.

Leading the cast once again is Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky. By now, Shia is undoubtedly as comfortable playing Sam as he is in his own skin. Such familiarity with a character could lead to boredom seeping into an actor's performance, but not with Shia.

It's clear that Shia has grown over the course of these films right along with his character, and this time around everything about his performance feels so much more relaxed, natural, and mature. That's not to say that Shia's wit has died down as a result, far from it in fact. His comedic timing seems better than ever, and his one-liners and sarcastic observations are much keener than previously seen.

Next to Shia, through much of the film, is a new leading lady, played by model turned actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Some may miss former lead actress Megan Fox, whose departure from the film was highly publicized, but Rosie does a good job of stepping in as Shia's new girlfriend Carly. And as surprising as this may seem, Rosie actually is a decent actress, delivering a much more consistent performance than Megan did in either of her two outings.

Other returning cast members fleshing out the familiar supporting roles are Josh Duhamel as Lt. Colonel Lennox, Tyrese Gibson as Epps, and John Turturro as former S7 agent, Seymour Simmons.

Each of these actors get their time to shine in this film, just as they did in the previous two, but their characters feel more naturally integrated into the story than ever before. For instance, this time around the military's involvement seemed more logical due to the presence of Transformers on Earth no longer being kept secret.

As for Simmons, his involvement wasn't pure coincidence as it was last time. With the Transformers operating openly in the public, inserting Simmons into the action felt like an obvious choice given his character's obsession with the robots.

Speaking of John Turturro's character, I thought the eccentric nature of Simmons really fit with his demoted status quo in the last film. However, now that he's a filthy rich author due to his conspiracy theories and first-hand knowledge of the Transformers, his quirks are even better suited to the character.

Now some complain that John Turturro's performance as Simmons has always threatened to derail these movies. Personally, I've always gotten a big kick out of his portrayal and feel that just like everything else in this film, he's never been better.

Also, showing up in two brief cameo appearances are character actors, Julie White and Kevin Dunn, as Sam's parents. I have enjoyed their characters every time they have appeared in the previous movies, and I was glad to see they were included yet again.

Once more we are given several hilarious one-liners, especially from Julie as Sam's boundary-ignoring, borderline inappropriate mother. Sadly though, we were only given their two short appearances in the film. I for one would have enjoyed seeing more of them again, but honestly they wouldn't have really fit into the story, so it was probably for the best.

Newcomers to the cast, aside from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, are several high-profile, A-list actors and actresses ranging from John Malkovich (""Con Air"") and Frances McDormand (""Fargo"") to Alan Tudyk (""A Knight's Tale"") and the increasingly popular Ken Jeong (""The Hangover""). While some of these characters had moments of seriousness, Frances McDormand's character being the most serious-minded; for the most part, they all delivered great bits of levity amidst the robo-led apocalypse descending upon mankind.

Alongside the actors appearing on the screen were the talented voice-over actors breathing life into the CGI-created Transformers. Each voice-over cast member delivered excellent work and made their characters really feel alive to the audience. As always the sound of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime continues to make those of us who grew up watching the 1980's animated series feel like kids again.

Joining the voice-over cast is the legendary Leonard Nimoy (""Star Trek"") as the long-lost Autobot, Sentinel Prime. Leonard's gravelly voice brought a sense of gravitas and authority that was vital to the portrayal of Optimus' predecessor. Plus, the nod or two to Leonard's history as Spock from ""Star Trek"" was a fun little easter egg for fans to look and listen for.

Of course, with these films all of the cast and crew's hard work would be for naught if it wasn't for the outstanding visual effects work. As with the previous two movies, the bar for CGI in film has been raised once more. The realism on display when bringing the two warring factions of Transformers to life continues to be astounding. Not to mention, the final hour alone, when the war really comes to a crescendo, makes the whole movie worth watching.

So after all that, I leave you with this final thought. If you are one of the numerous fans who lost interest in this franchise after the perceived horror that was ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", then this latest installment will erase that pain and make you remember what it's like to be a kid again.

And in the end, just like its predecessors, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is the epitome of what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be and proud of it.

""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1310860800,2,9458,4.979074191502853
4318563,3,B004BDOEZO,"I went to see this one earlier in the week with a buddy of mine.  After finally getting caught up with some of the writing, I took a couple days to see Keith Birdsong and hung out in Muskogee, Oklahoma.  It was his birthday and he wanted to go see Transformers 3.  I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing the movie.  The second movie was too long, too loud, and too confusing.  I didn't enjoy it at all.

Sadly, this movie hit me the same way.  Some of the graphics were really awesome, some of the gags were incredibly funny, and I really enjoyed hearing Leonard Nimoy as a character.  I still maintain that Shia LeBeouf is an immensely watchable star and will be a remarkable leading man in a few more years.

Despite LeBeouf's acting, there's just not much of a story for him to work with.  His role throughout this film kept getting minimized and maximized, and I was never really sure if he was going to matter during the resolution.  As it turned out, not much.

John Tuturro won my heart with several lines and with his scenery-chewing acting.  He didn't mind going over the top with his character or making fun of it at the same time.  I think I'd love to see a movie that focuses on this character tracking down some government conspiracy.  It would be a lot of fun.

One of the things that really bothered me about this movie as well was a separation between Witwicki (LeBeouf) and Bumblebee.  I think they should have been together more.  That relationship was one of the things that really work for me in the first movie, which I did enjoy.

The graphic designs and effects were absolutely amazing though.  I loved seeing all the computer graphic action on the screen, as well as how the Transformers changed shape throughout.

So much of the story seemed to be add-ons.  Witwicky's scenes with his parents, the whole episode with John Malkovich, and even the subplot with the romantic triangle could have been dropped.  However, that would have left Witwicky off the screen.  They should have just made him part of the team and involved with the situation from the beginning.  That lay there wouldn't have been so much time lost looping in all of these other elements so that Witwicky would have had the screen time he did.

A quick look at the box office indicates that this film scored another high success in movie dollars, even though it didn't score so high with moviegoers.  I would suspect there will be a Transformers 4 coming.",1310860800,2,2464,4.515837104072398

Teleporting a whole planet arm's reach away from Earth -  well, even if you ignore the whole teleporting thing, the physics just don't add up. (Roche limit, anyone?) Then there's Carly with her high heels in a combat zone. I think that phrase says everything.

OK if you need an air-conditioned space on a summer day and want to see property values drop faster than collateralized debt obligations. Otherwise missable.

4318565,5,B004BDOEZO,i thought the action in this one was unbeleivable and just pure great. this is another movie that critics should just not give a review on. the acting is not the greatest but i am a fan of Labouf and the rest of the cast and i don't care what anyone else thinks but hes my favorite actor of my generation. this movie is mostly about the action the storyline is the same as the first two the dicepticons are trying to destroy the earth but Bay takes his skills to the next step and kicks some a** in these great CGI scenes. i won't go to far into it but this movie is something fun to watch where you root for the good guys thats it period i would love to see another one but i just don't see it happening Bay has said that himself but if he does do one wait a few years not two like the two before this one. GET THIS I WILL! TRANSFORMERS 3 RULES!!!,1310774400,2,848,3.936046511627907
4318566,4,B004BDOEZO,"My blurb.
I loved the entertainment this provided. Great CG effects. Great sound. Great 3D.
I didn't really watch the movie for the whole storyline as much as I did for effects which is probably a good thing.
Acting was okay and Megan Fox's replacement did a fine job but wasn't really something to gloat about.
Again, as happened in a previous Transformers movie, and at the beginning of this movie, the director wants us to believe there are sky scrapers in DC. This
is a glaring error that is hard to look over. Otherwise awesome entertainment!",1310428800,,547,4.649484536082475
4318567,2,B004BDOEZO,This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had.  I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's.  It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen.  I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment.  Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series.  I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film.  I was very disappointed!  As hard as that is to say.  It was really bad.,1310428800,6,488,3.8585858585858586
4318568,5,B004BDOEZO,"I LOVED IT!  It was about 2  hours long and was LOADED with action and CGI, and seeing this one in 3D added to the dimensionality of the movie.  The movie begins with a recap and then about 5-10 minutes historical clips of Kennedy, Nixon, and Cronkite from the NASA Moon Program. Pretty cool, I thought.  It seems as though there was other activity on the moon, before we got there.  Sentinel Prime and ship crashed there long ago, a mere 250 million miles from earth. Sentinel Prime was the ""guy"" who taught Optimus Prime.

Back on earth, our hero (Shia Labeof) is living with a gorgeous girl.  He got a really nice medal for saving the world but is currently unemployed.  The Autobots have formed an alliance with the government and are helping our allies with peacekeeping efforts, the whole time keeping their bot-eyes out for the Decepticons.

Finally!--I have seen a movie where 3D mattered.  (In their rush to make 3D movies lately, most of them seem as though the 3D just didn't add much.)  I also thought the vulture robot was awesome.  The little bad-mouthed jive robots are also awesome and get to play some contribute-to-save-the-world parts.  The battles are awesome with tons of action.  The combination of the stunts plus the CGI is just incredible (e.g. people sliding down outside a tall glass building while it is toppling over.)  There is intermittent humor and some appropriately placed music.  The parents return for a few brief comments here and there and to provide advice to our hero on love.  Patrick Dempsey plays a rich dude and John Malkovich plays a weird boss.  I will definitely watch this again.

And the highway chase. . . well, it's optimum-prime, Dude!",1310428800,3,1687,4.7353951890034365
4318569,5,B004BDOEZO,"I have seen this movie 2 times in theaters. Optimus Prime turns bad ass in this one when he says ""We will kill them all"". The wreckers are great as well as Sideswipe and Mirage. I strongly recommend.",1310256000,,199,4.2631578947368425
4318570,3,B004BDOEZO,"I will start this review by stating that I was not a fan if the previous entry in the series. OK let's be honest here: I hated it. And I really really hated it. Hated it so much at it left me wondering how a movie about gigantic Robots fighting could be so boring. Hell, you know a movie really sucks when even the director himself admits it sucks. So with that said, I was nervous when the announcement of a third Trannys movie had occurred.

Well for the most part, this review is full of compliments, but unfortunately, those compliments are for the technical stuff, and the acting.

The storyline is not as confusing as ROTF, but it still is quite messy. 2 years after the events that took place in Revenge of the Fallen, Sam has a new girlfriend, a smoking hit British gal Named Carly, who used to work for the British embassy and now works at a Vintage car dealership with a creepy and obsessive boss (played cleverly by Patrick Dempsey). Sam gets a job at an office building, and his parents have came to DC to visit.

Meanwhile, the Autobots find new enemies at hand: Soundwave, and Laserbeak, and even more so- a piece from a deception has been found while they were on mission in the Ukraine. This leads to the discovery of the fact that the 1969 Space Race was in response to the crashing of an Autobot on the dark side of the moon, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). Suddenly, things get out of hand when Optimus unknowingly sets off a war, causing Sentinel to betray Optimus by working for the Decepticons and begin t use Earth as a source of renewal for Cybertron, making our future look bleak.

Is your head hurting from reading the above two paragraphs? Don't worry, mine is hurting just from typing them (and on my iPad to boot).

The action is simply stellar. I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in the second movie, and so therefore a stationery camera and longer shots made it more easy to take. The finale lasts an hour long and boy does it rule. Some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen is in that hour, specifically  the scene where they slide down the building. It is worth it to see the movie in 3D, specifically for one scene: The wing suit scene. I got vertigo from that scene because I am TERRIFIED of heights!

Admit it, you thought it would suck without Megan Fox. Well it actually is BETTER without that trashy gal. Rosie Huntington Whitely is so much hotter and way better at acting than Megan Fox. She can actually carry an emotion, unlike Fox. Furthermore Shia actually is great for once here, and he really shines. And boy, Leonard Nimoy stole the show! Live long and prosper, Sentinel! \\\\////

Now for the bad. The story. ""But that story doesn't sound messy!"" It might not, but watch the movie. I found myself asking who was on whose side. Furthermore, the movie simply is too long. They dragged it out for longer than they needed to, and the film could have had maybe 20 minutes trimmed from it. As well as sam's parents UGGGGGHHHHHH. Also, is it just me or did the decepticons look all the same? It was hard to tell who was who because they looked too similar to each other. And Megatron should have had a bigger role. He literally is only in the movie for 5 minutes.

In short, this movie is better than it's predecessor but still flawed and not as good as Tranny 1. I would recommend it solely on the strength of the action.and do go see in 3D too.",1310256000,,3416,4.3924050632911396
4318571,3,B004BDOEZO,"The Review:

Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the latest and final installment of the film series based on the 1980s line of Hasbro toys that spawned the popular cartoon series and cult animated film. Michael Bay is in full effect here, surpassing the prior live action films in terms of storytelling and explosions--lots and lots of explosions. The first Transformers film was decent, but the follow-up, Revenge of the Fallen was an awful mess. Fortunately, Dark of the Moon makes up for its predecessor with better pacing, excellent fan service, some comic relief, a very clever set up and amazing action sequences.

Shia LaBeouf reprises his role, but Megan Foxx is nowhere to be found, replaced by the equally arresting Rosie Huntington-Whitely.  But more importantly, Optimus Prime, voiced by Peter Cullen, is back. Let's face it; every human is a bit player standing next to a 20 foot tall robot, who looms even larger in the minds of those of us who watched the cartoons in the 80s.  The Autobots and Decepticons are examples of computer generated actors that routinely upstage their human costars thanks to the wizardry of Industrial Light and Magic. Serious fans of Transformers that recall the original animated movie will recognize the voice talent of Leonard Nimoy, who is the voice of Galvatron from the original animated movie. Look out for the clever reference to another Nimoy character early in the film that foreshadows one of Dark of the Moon's awesome twists.

The premise of Dark of the Moon is that the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union was a cover to retrieve autobot technology that crash-landed on the moon. Control of that technology will determine not only the victor in the ongoing war between the Autobots and Decepticons, but the fate of mankind as well. Corny? Perhaps, but if I didn't know better, the production values of Dark of the Moon suggest Michael Bay rented the Space Shuttle Columbia and sent a film crew to film huge chunks of the movie in space. The FX are impeccably done with only one scene early on that looks (forgivably) fake.

At the end of the day, Dark of the Moon is a bombastic action film that is competently written. It succeeds primarily on the strength of its special effects and benefits from favorable comparison to the inferior Revenge of the Fallen which preceded it. The movie is for the most part lighthearted, but in the final act it shifts tone and becomes much darker. It becomes surprisingly violent and pushes the boundaries of its PG-13 rating. Oddly, robot on robot violence seems to give the film makers license to amp up the carnage. The robots are so lifelike that there's an eerie human quality to their very violent clashes that I found a bit jarring. The violence was also in stark contrast to the films earlier, often comedic moments. If you enjoyed the two prior films then you will enjoy Dark of the Moon which does homage to the spirit of the Transformers in explosive Michael Bay fashion.

4318572,2,B004BDOEZO,"After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong. This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest. I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking. Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it. Heres what you do. Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes. Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish. Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me.",1309910400,5,692,4.634146341463414
4318573,3,B004BDOEZO,"From a visual and aural point of view, this is a great movie. The action scenes in this, the third movie in the franchise are as spectacular as ever. The special effects are breathtaking (the stunning scene where Decepticon Shockwave's driller cuts a Chicago skyscraper in two is almost worth the entry price alone), the robot violence manic and the various scenes where Transformers transform from earthly vehicles into their robot forms brilliant as ever. The makers of this film were clearly enjoying themselves. And Autobot leader Optimus Prime is a valiant character, perhaps the best character in the film. Where this film falls down, though, is the narrative, which just doesn't deliver. There is some obscure stuff about the Decepticons murdering Russian and American scientists to cover up their secret plans. Then the characters of the film - both human and Transformer - proceed to mumble their way through the plot. Not great. On top of this, the characterization of the human characters in this film is a bit lacking. Also main character Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has become rather annoying in this third film, and I preferred his love interest in the previous two films Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) to her replacement in this film Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Finally the humour in this film falls a bit flat, and the ending is poor.

This could have been a very good sci-fi actioner. As it is, it is a missed opportunity.",1309910400,2,1449,4.962962962962963
4318574,4,B004BDOEZO,"Let me say this from the start: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a quantum leap improvement over its wretched predecessor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Revenge-of-the-Fallen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0019M5C0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  Featuring a comprehensible story that flows logically, some solid acting from Shia LaBeouf (in top form as the hyper Sam Witwicky), Peter Cullen (who IS Optimus Prime), John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Patrick Dempsey, and top-notch special effects, it is a fun ride that is very enjoyable to watch.

In fact, if someone stopped the movie after the first half, I would have said that it was THE best of the three movies by far.  (Minor spoilers ahead) Transformers: DOTM takes a risk in its opening scenes by deciding to jump into conspiracy theory territory with its assertion that the Apollo lunar program was designed to get NASA astronauts to the moon to investigate an alien crash landing, but the risk pays off marvelously as the film masterfully interweaves news footage of the lunar landing with the mysterious discovery of a crashed Transformer spacecraft.  This spacecraft (The Ark), as it turns out, contains Sentinel Prime (voiced by the always excellent Leonard Nimoy), former leader of the Autobots, in stasis.  Sentinel, in turn, is the only Transformer who can activate a device that could not only unleash an army of Decepticon warriors on Earth, but even end life as we know it.  The movie contains some nice plot twists and double crosses that I will not get into here, but all in all, it has a solid plot on par with the first film.  Visits from likeable characters from the previous films- Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), Agent Simmons (John Turturro), Lt. Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel), and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are very welcome.

Oh, and for those who were wondering if Megan Fox could be replaced, YES she can.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, besides featuring her obvious beauty and attractiveness, acquits herself quite nicely in her first movie.  Will she be winning an Oscar from this film?  Of course not, but let's face it: the script uses her mostly as eye candy, but she admirably rises above that as Sam's likeable and sweet new girlfriend.

Where the movie loses a point, and thus falls behind the first movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;IMHO, is in the second half, when the Autobots and Decepticons engage in a battle royale, winner-take-all struggle in Chicago.  It is at this point in the movie that you can almost sense that the script has been barely holding Director Michael Bay back like a rabid attack dog on a leash.  Once we get to Chicago, the leash is dropped and Bay ferociously attacks the viewer with a special effects assault unlike anything seen before.  Now, the effects are UNDENIABLY impressive.  The 2007 original film featured very impressive effects, and it is surprising how much they have improved in four years time.  Autobots and Decepticons destroy humans, buildings, and each other in a dazzling display of digital imagery.  The mistake Director Bay makes is failing to heed an important lesson: LESS IS MORE.  By having frame after frame after frame of shooting, explosions, carnage, and mayhem, eventually I became numb to the special effects and they lost some of their punch.

(Also, a word of warning to those who go see the movie in 3D- eat your popcorn/munchies before the battle in Chicago.  Besides numbing, I found the all-out special effects extravaganza to be slightly nauseating with the non-stop motion, loud noise, and explosions.)

In short, the movie would have been better if the Chicago battle was cut in half.  I cannot believe that SOMEONE- one of the editors or Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, for example- did not urge Bay to cut back on the special effects-laden climax (although in fairness, perhaps they did and were overruled by Bay, who is clearly in love with his digital toys that he can blow up).  Bay is a talented director to be sure, but the movie would have been better served if he had allowed the viewer to breathe from time to time in the second half.

So what we're left with is a fun summer, popcorn movie that I will be excited to add to my DVD collection right next to the first movie, and is a good end to the trilogy.  The new movie - wisely - ignores the second movie almost completely, so I think Transformers fans can be proud to have the first and third movies on their shelf and pretend the second one never happened.  Both Director Bay and Shia LaBeouf have stated that this is their last Transformers movie.  That may be for the best.  I would be excited to see what a director like J.J. Abrams - or even Steven Spielberg himself- could do with a Transformers reboot.  A movie that balanced character development, plot, and the JUDICIOUS use of special effects would give us the Optimus Prime of Transformers movies.",1309824000,2,5194,5.200480192076831

And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!",1309737600,3,653,4.45

Tied in with the NASA moon mission of the late '60s, the movie picks up with the Decepticons attempting to secure technology that will bring their home planet to Earth, allowing them to use our planet's resources to repair theirs. The special effects were top-notch and the destruction of Chicago was amazing to watch as the city was cordoned off by the Decepticons. The battle scene in Chicago's city limits to close the movie was fantastic and my boys (ages 11 and 8) were entranced throughout. Pure eye candy and definately a blu-ray purchase when released.

4318579,3,B004BDOEZO,"This movie was certainly not the worst scifi superheroish movie I've ever seen. It had some very good qualities to the storyline.

The battle at the end does go on much longer than it needed to. It began to lose some of the audiences interest as it continued on and on. However, the first two transformers movies did the same thing.

It was also rather obvious they were killing the bulk of their characters just so that they had a reason to end the franchise and not make a fourth movie. Ending on a third movie is becoming a bit of a cliche'. So many have ended on 3 movies that it's becoming very sad that they decided this magic number is the perfect place to fall on their swords. Some movies have decided not to follow the crowd and managed to make it past the third movie and further. Such as X-Men, Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Lord of the Rings.

Bottom line it was a good movie, but not good enough to warrent 5 stars. I plan to buy it when it is out on DVD, and recommend others to watch it.",1309651200,,1015,4.168367346938775

The battles were easier to distinguish between the robots, they where in much more detail than in the previous movies, the special effects were better and I loved that the human race had equal time in the fight and actually looked like they were able to fight back.

4318581,4,B004BDOEZO,"Someday they'll come out with Jane Austen's TRANSFORMERS, and that'll shut everyone's yaps. Me, I saw TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, and I wasn't sure whether to pat myself on the back or wallow in self-loathing. Because the parts that I liked, I really, really liked. And yet Michael Bay overnight hasn't become a more subtle, more graceful director, and so the stuff one resents about him is still there in glorious 2- or 3D. Like its predecessors, DARK OF THE MOON is essentially Michael Bay yelling at the top of his voice. If REVENGE OF THE FALLEN had a redeeming quality, it's probably  that it lowered the bar for future Transformers films. DARK OF THE MOON definitely benefits.

It starts off really promisingly, with a revisionist look at Apollo 11 and its historic landing on the moon, and what really galvanized the 1960s space race between the U.S. and the Soviets. The first fifteen minutes or so unspool fantastically as we get to relive the momentous lunar landing complete with archival (and ""new"") footage of JFK, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin. Then we arrive at the shocking revelation, that, once the public video feed is cut off, the real mission is launched, that of Armstrong and Aldrin investigating an alien vessel what crashed in the Sea of Tranquility.

We cut to present-day Washington, DC and catch up with Sam Witwicki who is three months out of college, is jobless, is Mikaela-less. Even though Sam's been decorated with a presidential hero medal, he's feeling unappreciated. And I guess having saved the world twice now will give you that sense of entitlement, right? Sam's hot new girlfriend Carly is inspiring him to new lows of inadequacy, what with her dazzlingly successful career and her being the money maker in the relationship. And, to make things worse, his crazy parents are visiting from out of town, so Sam is girding himself for all the inappropriate humor.

Sam seems to have lost touch with most of the Autobots. Even his pal, Bumblebee, has been making himself scarce of late. Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots have been whiling away their time by assisting their human allies with various covert ops, even as they cast a vigilant eye out for the true enemy, the Decepticons. And it was only a matter of time, isn't it? Megatron, ruinous parts and all, is still making a bid for power. He's already set his scheme in motion.

DARK OF THE MOON is best served during its opening and closing acts. The middle bits come off as Michael Bay's indulgence in silly stunt casting and asinine goings-on. I do think that Michael Bay is savvy in the ways of staging them epic action sequences. But he flounders in those intimate moments, y'know, those acting bits which are supposed to make us care about the characters. John Malkovich's role is unnecessary and, on top of that, there's a jarring character turn which is a complete departure from the personality he'd established earlier. Ken Jeong also has a small part as ""Deep Wang"" but it's basically Ken Jeong playing Ken Jeong, and while I thought he was pretty funny, his performance took me out of the movie. Alan Tudyk also has a supporting part as John Turturro's (German?) assistant, and, Buddha bless him, Alan Tudyk cannot do wrong. I thought he was marvelous and wicked funny. Yet again. By the way, I do appreciate it that John Turturro tones it down somewhat (but he's still plenty quirky). Meanwhile, Frances Mcdormand comes in as the no-nonsense Director of National Intelligence. With all that acting pedigree, you'd think Michael Bay would've been able to come up with a stronger human element to the story. What does it say when the most emotive character turns out to be a yellow Chevy Camaro?

Much noise about how the Victoria's Secret model would fare versus Megan Fox. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is just as hot as Megan Fox, and is as talented an actress as Megan. Michael Bay absolutely exploits her in this film, and you see how that isn't such a jerk move once you realize that Megan Fox's career was launched by Bay doing the exact same thing. ""Carly Spencer"" serves as eye candy, and she's admirably qualified. But, oh, did the snickers roll in as the pretty, pretty model just vacuously stood there for that one timeless moment whilst Transformers mayhem tore sh-- up in the background. What the hell was Bay thinking in that scene? It's so dismissive of her character.

The narrative touches a bit on the long-waged Autobot-Decepticon war and how the Autobots once had an opportunity to win it decisively, hinged on a game-changing invention of Sentinel Prime. And I do think it's an absolute coup snatching Leonard Nimoy to voice Sentinel Prime, who was once the Autobots' leader. Nimoy and Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus) play off each other beautifully. And I'd never heard Nimoy sound so gravelly and, er, emotional. He even drops a classic line from STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN. I'll leave it to you whether his quote was wise or groan-inducing.

Is there a danger of becoming desensitized? Absolutely. Bay injects his patented explosions on an ad nauseam constant, and you factor in, too, Bay's detached style of storytelling, his shaky knack for swaying you with the humanizing elements. Really, this franchise was never more resonant than when it was mostly about a boy and his car in the first film. Sam Witwicki, sequel by sequel, seems to engage more and more in histrionics. It's two and a half hours' worth of the Perils of Sam Witwicki. And his girlfriend is taller.

In the midst of warring giant robots, the humans are often overwhelmed and rendered near insignificant. So I like that, this time around, Sam and the military guys actually hold their own in certain scenes. I like that the film makes more use of slo-mo so that we can observe more closely just what the hell is going on during all the frenetic robot-on-robot violence. It's still frequently hard to distinguish who the 'bots are, apart from the higher profiled ones. I think that's Wheeljack over there sporting that stupid Einstein look.

Aside from the silly bits, DARK OF THE MOON is surprisingly dark in tone, and one wishes Bay had done away with all the frivolous indulgences. One fallout to how high the stakes are is that we get a more brutal Optimus Prime. The last 45 minutes or so is basically one long extended battle scene set in a devastated Chicago, and I wouldn't be surprised if $100 mil went into the making of it. It is glorious special effects.

I think, ultimately, DARK OF THE MOON does earn its spectacle. The opening segment and the last 45 minutes validate the thing. Maybe, during the saggy middle portion, you can slip out and sneak into LARRY CROWNE (although I hear that film's not exactly raking in the raves; oh, well, maybe BRIDESMAIDS is still out). Then come back for the final hour of this one. Sound like a plan? Let's do that. That way, we can skip flotsam and jetsam material such as that Autobot with the Irish accent, and Sam's annoying parents, and Malkovich's creepy Bumblebee fetish, and that tiresome LaBoeuf-Huntington-Whiteley-Dempsey triangle (which, if you're just read it, looks more like a quadrangle). I don't think any of that crap is in the Jane Austen version.

With some amazement, I'm rating this 3.5 stars out of 5. So I guess I'm recommending DARK OF THE MOON. Huh.",1309651200,2,7332,4.769109535066982

People have said that Bay was sad after people hated Falled so much,and so he tried to make Sam feal like him. Why is Bay so greedy for money anyway? He shouldn't have made this one,it is horrible to say that Megan Fox's character dumped Sam. After all they have been through??? I mean seriously! Can you imagine going back to watch the first two where the relationship was built knowing that it would be torn dow in the third?
But then it transformed faster than Magatron can into a comedy which can be compared to the Muppets. The jokes are insane and sick. I was surprised and started to worry that the whole movie would be like that.
Nope. Then came part two. Optimus Prime allows an ENTIRE city of people to die just to prove a point.
Then comes part three. BOOM! SMASH! PUNCH! BOOM! SMASH! PUNCH!,wait a moment,I thought I just watched that! It went on forever! There was a moment where I was just sitting there staring at the screen and allowing my attention to wander. I was just waiting for it to end...
And then it did end:The battle was all too fast and short.",1309651200,7,1305,4.308943089430894
4318584,5,B004BDOEZO,"""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" is great! This is how the story goes: When a mysterious event from Earth's past erupts into the present day it threatens to bring a war to Earth so big that the Transformers alone will not be able to save us.

The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Sam), Josh Duhamel (as Lennox), John Turturro (as Simmons), Tyrese Gibson (as Epps), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (as Carly), & Patrick Dempsey (as Dylan) is great. The directing by Michael Bay (who also executive produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Ehren Kruger is great.

The music by Steve Jablonsky is great. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is great. The film editing by Roger Barton, William Goldenberg & Joel Negron is great. The casting by Denise Chamian is great. The production design by Nigel Phelps is great. The art direction by Benjamin Edelberg, Kevin Ishioka & Richard L. Johnson is great. The set decoration by Jennifer Williams is great. The costume design by Deborah L. Scott is great. The visual effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) & Digital Domain is excellent.

This is a great sequel that is just as good as its original and a sequel that is better than its recent sequel. This is another hit for Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. This is one of the best movies of the summer and the best action movies of the year, so far.",1309651200,3,1354,4.656903765690377
4318585,3,B004BDOEZO,"Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) now working as a mail deliverer in an office building, but he thinks he deserves better since he saved the world 2 times ""yet, he leaves out that his giant robot friends helped...or did most the work"".  Sam has also replaced the other hot girl who was just there for eye candy, with Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington) who's also just here for eye candy.
  While the Decepticons are back and Dylan (Patrick Dempsey), a rich playboy is working for them and wants to use Sam to get information from the Autobots. The Decepticons also want to bring there planet to Earth and wipe out mankind, yet Dylan thinks he'll be spared of course. You also have Optimus Prime having to go up against his former mentor, Sentinal Prime who's helping the Decepticons.
  Transformers: Dark of the Moon is about as loud as part 2 with non-stop action that involves Transformers clunking together and ripping each other apart , but it's more fun with a better story ""what there is of one."" While there's some nice visuals, like when the soldiers are gliding through the air through the city on hang-gliders. When Witwicky and friends are hanging from a falling building is also a pretty well done disaster sequence.
  However, Michael Bay needs to stop thinking that he's making Gone with the Wind, when he's just making a Transformer movie, lol. What I mean, is that these films are too long and there's not enough story for them to be so long and then just give us a similar ending with Optimus Prime giving another corny speech. Megatron is also wasted as the villain yet again and always seems to just be there, so he can eventually be ripped apart by Optimus, yet again. If Michael Bay doesn't come back for part 4 and is replaced by someone more talented, I won't shed a tear.",1309564800,,1785,4.59433962264151
4318596,3,B004BDOEZO,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a stupid summer movie, but it is a huge improvement over the last film in the series and features some of the best CGI ever. The story is oh so familiar, you know, giant robots from outer space fighting the other space robots that have taken a liking to the human race. This time we learn about a secret 1969 mission to the moon that had to do more with stealing alien technology than just the accomplishment of the landing on a moving space rock before the Russians.

Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, this is a long movie (nearly 3 hours with previews) and you will definitely feel the length. As great as the visuals are, director Michael Bay never lets up in the last hour and it becomes a draining experience. But hey, there is some beautiful destruction as the robots demolish Chicago. Not to mention that the fight scenes are shot well enough to tell who is fighting who.

The cast is huge and they do a good enough job, though most of the dialogue, as expected in a Michael Bay film, is very weak. I will admit that some of the jokes landed this time around. Shia LaBeouf was less annoying here than in the previous two and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaced Megan Fox with ease. She looked good and her character's personality was way more likeable. Not bad for a Victoria's Secret models first acting role. Francis McDormand added a bit of believability to all the stupidity, while John Turturro, John Malkovich and Ken Jeong provided plenty of weirdness. At least they seemed to be having fun, but we all know the real stars of the series are the robots. We get a bunch of new ones and the old favorites. Leonard Nimoy provided excellent voice work for the former Autobot leader (I loved the Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan reference).  Hugo Weaving still gives Megatron the right amount of ferocity, but the standout, as in the previous two movies, is Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. His voice adds a quality of strength and compassion to an already noble character. When he is not talking, let's just say that Optimus does not mess around in this one.

I tried to see it in IMAX 3-D. To my disappointment the theater was only showing it in digital 3-D, so I went with that after reading that 3-D is the only way to see it. I was very impressed. Probably the best since Avatar. I noticed almost no blurring and the picture was crystal clear.

To my surprise, half the theater clapped when it was over and that rarely happens. As for myself, I wasn't expecting what I predict The Dark Knight Rises will deliver next summer. It's a good summer movie that never pretends to be anything more. The CGI is worth admission alone, but there are a number of good laughs, more action than anything in existence and the moon landing sequence might trick you into believing that you won't lose as many brain cells as you did with Revenge of the Fallen, but don't worry, they will be gone forever by the time the end credits role.

4318597,4,B004BDOEZO,One of the things that people make a mistake on is that these transformers movies do not and i repeat do not follow a story the way a normal triogy does. these movies while i love them and hope to see another transformers movie in the future the movies play out like full length live action animated features films and to me that is what they are. this new movie in my opinion has no connection to the other transformerss movies and that is how people should look at this new movie and the second transformers movie revenge of the fallen they are just another transformers movie. believe me this movie is worth checking out.,1309478400,3,624,4.434782608695652
4318598,2,B004BDOEZO,"One thing that baffles me, is how someone who was never a fan of the original cartoon and an almost 70 year old producer are somehow qualified to revamp a franchise and cater it to the same kids-now adults that will wonder if they ever watched the series, researched the series or have a clue as to why kids liked it in the first place.  Somehow I can't find the answer and that has been the biggest problem with this franchise.  Besides Prime, nothing is relatable to the original series to tie these same adults to it in a manner that will have longevity.  Basically they got it wrong, when sometimes people get it right and satisfy the youth locked into the 20-30 something adult much like some goof-off movie like Fanboys or recently Iron Man.  Still, all nostalgia aside even as a casual fan, the last two movie totally sucked.  The story's were lame and the dialogue was horrible and almost embarrassing, I would never tell someone to watch it out of feeling shame when they thought it sucked.
I walked into this movie expecting it to be worse, as usually the middle act of a trilogy is the best and thus I had no inclination that this could be drug out of the gutter.  I was surprised.  The movie still suffers from the usual nonsense however.  Steven Spielberg has this penchant for always adding wise cracking ""Gremlin"" style characters to his movies and they are in abundance here.  Laserbeak looks like a robotic reject puppet part from the movie ""The Dark Crystal"" without the puppet cast and has the most annoying, cliche' 80's sultress cartoon voice.  Imagine a evil female villian from any Disney film and there you go.  These characters use social dialogue which will only date a film years past and are annoying in present day as it is, adding horrible top 40 music doesn't help either.  How can I get into a movie with that girlie guy from American Idol singing in the background, its impossible.  The script is a little better this time around but for a movie targeted at kids and to sell kids toys and other stuff, its laced with adult themes and slander.  I would not take a child to this movie under 10, maybe 13.  When gremlin mini robot says ""this is a cluster"" at which time the scene changes everyone knows what they are implying.  So whats the point of that?  To be clever?  This movie is dumbed down like a comedy, but uses adult themes like a drama, but has hardcore action scenes like a ""R"" action movie, autobots getting their heads blown off execution style.  Who is this catered too?  Kids?  Adults?  Again I am lost.  The action scenes were well done, way better than the previous films inwhich the director is so impressed with the CGI that they slow it down and ram it down your throats while ignoring the reason they are in the scene to begin with.  I once knew someone that said they thought it was awesome because the affects were so neat.  Thats a sad thing to say about a movie.  This time they ace all the close-ups of the gears and constant motion and use longer shots and more character driven scenes, such as between Bumblebee and that kid who isn't called Spike.  There are some throwbacks in this film, unlike the others that avoided them.  Megatron is still nothing like the character people rememeber.  They debut Shockwave but give no explaination of where he came from, however he is at least similar to the origianl.  They break out a new ""Prime"" using Leonard Nimoy, who voiced Galvatron in the animated cult classic.  He is moreless Ronimus Prime gone bad.  The movie imploys the storyline losely of the episode ""The Ultimate Doom"" from the 84 season.  Bringing Cybertron to earth.  Cybertron by the way is a desolate shell of a planet with no life...why bring it to Earth via a space bridge is never explained.  Another thing never explained is how this kid picks up hot chicks like his love interest.  That is more unbelievable that anything in the movie.",1309478400,3,3911,4.545064377682404
4318599,3,B004BDOEZO,"You would think that after two giant movies in a franchise, the people in charge would learn from mistakes, and make sure the series finale would have all that was good, and jettison everything that didn't work.  Astonishingly, while ""Dark"" features more of what we want, it has seemingly failed to learn from it's predecessors and their mistakes.

""Dark of the Moon"" follows the autobots, valiant robots from outer space, as they continue their endless struggle for freedom and tyranny.  Only this time, the evil decepticons have a secret weapon that can turn the tide in their favor, and not even the combined forces of the autobots may be enough to save humanity this time.

After the previous entry in the series, ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" Michael Bay promised that the third film would be the best in the series, and to that end, he was mostly right.  ""Dark"" is indeed the most enjoyable movie of the trilogy, in that the story is fairly straightforward, there's a higher sense of menace, and the robot action is the best yet, especially at certain points during the climactic Chicago battle.  Yet, despite being the best film in the series, ""Dark"" has the the exact same flaws in the previous two films:  Humans take up a majority of the story instead of the robots, to the point where it feels like the transformers are guest stars in their own movie; there are too many human characters who add little to nothing to the story, such as Simmons (who doesn't need to be in the film at all) and his bodyguard; and the film is too long, with numerous scenes that should have been cut out (mostly everything with Sam trying to find a job, and his parents).

Still, despite all the flaws, ""Dark"" does offer quite a bit of fun.  When the transformers themselves finally get to do things, they are relentlessly compelling to watch, thanks to the photo-realistic CGI.  Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) is a fascinating character, while Optimus and all the other robots, both autobot and decepticon, continue to hold our attention.  The cinematography is also excellent this time around, with many gorgeous vistas and great scenery.  The fight scenes are also more enjoyable, due to the camera lingering on each shot for a few seconds longer then in previous films.

Overall, ""Dark"" is something of a mixed bag.  While it does offer the best that the Transformers series has to offer, it's impressive visuals and action are marred by mistakes that have been repeated time and time again.  For those who enjoy Mr. Bay's brand of films, and are willing to overlook the fat and excess screen time for unneeded human characters should find plenty to enjoy here.",1309392000,2,2661,4.754347826086956
4318600,5,B004BDOEZO,This is by far the best of the current trilogy of the Transformers movies franchies.  I cannot wait till it is in IMAX in my area and comes to Blu-Ray.  This is a must to see.,1309305600,3,175,3.8333333333333335
4318601,5,B004BDOEZO,"Slick and badass is a good way to describe the movie. If you have seen the other two movies, you know what to expect: impressive special effects, lots of action, lots of battles with Autobots and Decepticons and much more. The movie didn't letdown in any category.

Story: After the moon expedition in late 60s, Nasa discovers a piece a relic from Cyberton wars in the form of Sentinel prime-the original leader of the Autobots. The Autobots are angry that the earthlings have kept this discovery from them, but greater troubles lay ahead as the Decepticons are also aware of the finding and look to use Sentinel's return for their own advantage.

That's pretty much the gist of it without giving away much spoilers. There's also a side story with Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) again trying to adjust to some normalcy as the quite hero who this time has trouble finding employment. Megan Fox was fired and replaced by Rosie Huntington as everybody knows. People said this would hurt the movie but really it had no effect whatsoever on it. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back to reprise again their roles of Lennox and Epps.

The acting was fine. There was a lot of comedy as well, but when the action starts up, it didn't let up. Once again whether you love or hate Michael Bay you cannot deny that this franchise under his direction has been pretty cool. Yes it's flashy, it's slick, occasionally using some slapstick, but it's fun and entertaining. He knows when to tone things down and then turn the gears on when it's time.

Really that's what you come to expect from a movie like Transformers for a great time and to again recall some nostalgia from your childhood with these live adaptations. All in all a very good effort, no complaints at all. Recommended.",1309305600,3,1765,4.665594855305466
4318602,5,B004BDOEZO,"Now this is how you make a summer blockbuster movie! The action is so epic and it never stops. The visuals are insane and breath-taking. It has those hilarious moments, and even Mr. Chow from The Hangover gives a great cameo. It's a much darker film and not entirely kid-friendly. I'm sure anyone that grew up with the cartoon in the 80's would love it. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a newcomer this time playing Carly, Sam's new love interest. If you don't dwell on it, you probably won't miss Megan Fox.

The Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. They soon find out why they originally sent Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, to discover a Cybertronian ship piloted by Sentinel Prime carrying pillars called The Ark. Optimus revives Sentinel and is immediately betrayed by one of his own. Sentinel and Megatron team up and try to bring their planet; Cybertron to earth. It's up to Sam, Carly, Lennox, Epps and the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons once and for all. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON!!!",1309305600,,1025,4.694444444444445
4318603,2,B004BDOEZO,"*** Warning, potential spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.  Some events intentionally discussed in different order than they really occurred***

Whatever you do, don't be deceived by all the glowing reviews here.  After sitting through this movie and seeing for myself, I can easily say that it's the worst by far in the series.  The plot has holes big enough to hide Cybertron (i.e. how did Megatron come back to life again, and end up in the middle of Africa?).  The acting is equally forced and without any dramatic effect (why in God's name do they keep insisting on pushing Sam's lame parents into the story?!)  And why couldn't Sam have finally found a real woman with an actual brain to be his girlfriend?  Rosie is even more lifeless than Megan Fox on screen and is obviously little more than eye candy since even her few dialogue scenes are shot from behind to highlight the backside that is her only real asset.

Did I mention this is also the longest Transformers movie (152 minutes?!)?  That really shocks me - especially when nothing really important even happens during the entire first half of the film.  I found myself checking my watch several times throughout, and that is never a good sign when watching a movie.  They start by showing the back-story involving the manned space missions to the moon, but after that it just stalls for at least 45 minutes as it flails around trying to fill in the last few years of Sam's life (oh, he's ended up with another bimbo, big surprise; gee, nothing says ""exciting action movie"" like a half hour of Sam sitting around pushing paper in an office cubicle).  If they had at least given Sam somebody actually worth saving, the movie might have had some actual drama to it.  Even in the eventual cliche ""lovers reunite and run towards each other to embrace"" scene, Rosie stops after only a couple awkward steps and makes Sam run the entire distance to her (wow, really great job capturing the drama there, Bay).  Even Shia has this weird ""was she really even worth it"" expression on his face during their embrace (you can tell throughout the entire movie that Shia had to force himself to work with her).  Then, after an eternity (probably close to an hour in), the film finally gets back to the Autobots trying to reach the moon before the Decepticons in order to protect whatever it is that's there.  I'm still not sure how they never detected the energy signature on the moon two movies ago when they were first flying towards Earth but, hey, it is what it is.

Then, inexplicably (it's almost like Bay just ran checked his watch and said ""okay, we filled 2.5 hours, let's quit""), the movie decides to go on fast-forward and end after yet another super quick (read, one hit) battle between Optimus and Megatron in which Megatron's head is dismembered.  Literally, after Optimus wins and utters a stupid one-liner about never forsaking humans, the credits roll.  Wait, isn't this supposed to be a grand finale to the series?  And the utlimate climactic sequence took only two minutes and there was no real conclusion whatsoever?  Just another mailed-in money grab that puts a once promising franchise out of its misery at a new low.  In fact, the best part was actually the Captain America trailer that showed before it started.",1309305600,8,3288,4.691637630662021
4318604,5,B004BDOEZO,"The most technologically astounding film franchise concludes with its strongest and finest installment. This movie truly is ""More than meets the eye."" In 2007 Michael Bay brought to life the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons added in with the human touch of a teenage boy getting his first car. Transformers truly has been my favorite movie since the day I saw it, and then in 2009 the Transformers returned to the big screen in a very critically bashed sequel, that I still found to be just as fun as the first. Transformers Dark of the Moon is so different than the first two installments in every way. Making it more serious, dark and overall believeable and enjoyable. I don't think I must adress the effects because Transformers fan or not you cant deny that the effects raise the bar for what had been seen in a film. Michael Bay has made his masterpiece film, attempting things that have never been thought of before. Some parts in the movie will make you want to think they are digital effects, but in fact many of the shots are genuine. The soldiers diving out of planes flying through the city of Chicago in their own flight suits was real. Unlike the plot line of the first film, you have many human elements to the story line but still keeping it otherworldly. The plot twists major events from throughout history such as the moon landing, explaining that the space race between the United States and The USSR was to investigate a detected crash that turns out to be the flagship of the Autobots. These events held from Optimus and the other Autobots from the first film. The plot ties together very well, and features so many classic 60's sci-fi elements. On the note of the Transformers, like in the second movie there are new Autobots on Earth, but it is explained how they got there. Robot characters each have there own good amount of screen time and dialogue. Instead of delivering one liners in the second film. The movie has some great big name actors introduced into the series, such as Patrick Dempsey and John Malkovich. True Malkovichs character was as unneeded as Leo in the second film, but surprisingly Dempsey was great, SPOILER Humans are working with the decepticons, Dempsey is the great, badass playboy millionaire that he needs to be. Sentinal Prime voiced by the all time legendary Leonard Nimoy. Sentinal is my new favorite character of the Transformers franchise. He just has a great tone to him and he was beautifully designed. I was worried that the events of the second film would not continue on into the third, yet the Matrix of Leadership plays as a major key point. Adressing the whole Megan Fox is gone, a Transformers movie is not a Transformers movie because of whatever hot brain dead female actor they throw in for eye candy. Yet Rosie is much different that Megans character, she is much more confident and putting aside who looks better than who she does have a much brighter acting career ahead of her than Fox, she is a plot point and is in fact needed to the story. The film opens with some light comedy, that is actually very funny and easy to laugh out loud at. Wheter your immeressed in the Transformers mythos or not there is no denying that this is easily one of the best times you will have in the theater. This movie makes the first two look like mere commercials for this epic adventure. I feel my review is very clich using words such as epic and amazing but there is simply no other way to put it that I just watched to most enjoyable film of my life, and is by far my favorite movie along side the first Transformers. Easily an 11/10",1309305600,14,3608,4.569444444444445
4318605,5,B004BDOEZO,"Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots!
