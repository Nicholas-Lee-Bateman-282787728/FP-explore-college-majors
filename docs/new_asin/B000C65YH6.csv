8096036,2,B000C65YH6,"VOODOO BLACK EXORCIST (aka: BLOODY VOUDOU- 1974) starts off w/ a painted bald man named Nibo (Aldo Sambrell) and his painted, be-wigged woman friend (Eva Leon), in a canoe. Another bald guy -the betrayed husband?- attacks and is slain by Nibo. Thus, does the voodoo ritual ensue, complete w/ non-painted extras and bongo drums. A beheading of the painted girlfriend, the passing around of a rubber head, and topless dancing follow! The paint-covered Nibo is mummified and sealed in a coffin, in a cave. Space-age stock footage and acid rock, let us know that 2000 years have passed. The coffin is loaded onto a luxury cruise ship, and stuffed in the hold. Hyper-annoying passengers chatter. A fortune-teller predicts doom, A blazing-hot, Tongolele-like dancer eats fire, and momentarily allows us to forget this wretched movie. Nibo wakes up and begins his, now, un-painted rampage of unstoppable baldness, while wearing a fab-u-lous gold shirt! He suddenly sees the now paint-less reincarnation of his girlfriend (now named Sylvia), and turns himself into a heavily-painted prune man. He must reunite w/ her, the infra-red flashbacks tell us so! Oh, yes they do! Thank the voodoo gods, the hot dancer returns for another go! Alas, she's interrupted, a lot, by boring characters and their blither-blather! More psychedelic, hoodoo flashbacks occur. A man's severed head takes a stroll through the ship, winding up in Sylvia's bed, Godfather style! Death-by-steamroller is carried out by mummy man. A detective attempts to get to the bottom of things. Nibo fills Sylvia in on all the latest mummy news. A century's-worth of dull dialogue unfolds. Where's that voodoo dancer? Oh boy! There she is, and she's eating more fire!  Oh no! She is attacked by Nibo! The scene of her violent assault is a masterwork of idiocy, as we clearly see the camera crew reflected in the mirror in front of her! Nibo, looking like an oatmeal-covered John Malkovich, continues his onslaught. Will Sylvia realize who she really is? Will she find happiness w/ her moldy man-friend? Will that voodoo dancer return for a glorious encore?? Steel yourself for the big, fiery cave finale!...",1515888000,2,2163,5.110169491525424
8096037,2,B000C65YH6,"Here was a horror movie Id never heard of until this release on disc. My guess is it never opened wide and had limited airplay, including cable stations. So when I heard about it, being the horror fan I am, I thought Id give it a try. The end result is mixed.

The story involves a Caribbean voodoo priest who died years ago. At that time he was captured and force to watch the woman he loved decapitated while he was prepared for mummification. Years later that mummy has been purchased and is now on board a cruise ship on open water. Of course said mummy comes to life and must feed off of the living to retain his youthful appearance rather than the standard wrinkly form he arrived with.

His rampage isn't spread out to all thought as he focuses on several passengers who remind him of those who killed his long lost love. And, as is the case with most horror films, one of the passengers resembles that long lost love who he then believes to be a reincarnation of her. But when only one member of a couple thinks that way the odds of a romantic reunion aren't likely.

There you have it, the basic plotline for this film. Is it a good one? On so many levels the answer is no. The make up for the mummy looks as if someone took tissue paper, added some Elmers glue to have it adhere to the actors face and then put makeup on it. The beheadings look, as one reviewer put it, mannequin heads with red paint on the bases and squirt guns used to project blood. The acting isn't the worst ever but not for lack of trying. The story is confusing at times but easy enough to follow. And perhaps one of the worst things is the poor decision to take white actors and put them in blackface to portray the ill-fated island couple at the films opening.

All of that being said there is still a certain charm to the film. With a title like this if you expected a mega-budgeted extravaganza that shows more naivet on your part than on that of the film makers. This was an attempt at a horror film whose name was switched up to take advantage of hit films from the past. It wasn't the first time that was done nor will it be the last. Ive seen worse than this done with higher budgets.

The movie becomes one of those films you put on when friends gather around and have a few drinks, cracking wise on the actions onscreen while watching. A person would be hard pressed to take it seriously. But it can be fun in the right setting.

Many might ask why bother saving a film like this. The answer is simple. All film no matter what type it is deserves to be preserved. It becomes a part of our cinematic history, good or bad. Not all movies will be blockbusters and not all will rival those of Ed Wood. Most fall somewhere in between. But they are a part of history that someday movie fans will look at to find out what to do or not to do. They help provide a backdrop for other films to be measured against. This movie may not be your cup of tea but at least its there to be judged unlike a large number of films that have disappeared. At least there is that.",1505001600,,3049,4.194539249146757
8096038,1,B000C65YH6,"What negative thing can I say about this mummy film that hasn't been said before? 1,000 year old mummy is revived. Speaks English. Kills people. Wants Silvia (Eva Leon) who does take a gratuitous bath. They used a woman in the beginning with dark black skin and white features. Not sure what that was about. The lighting suddenly goes from daylight to night aka Ed Wood. While playing their drums there were electrical instruments mixed in...because...? Was that a camera man in the mirror?

In spite of all those short comings, the dubbing is horrible as was the plot and dialogue. Available on a 50 DVD set.

VOODOO BLACK EXORCIST (Spain-1974) is easily THE worst film I've seen this year. It's laughable, with goshawful sound effects, background music and English dubbing.

RANDOM IMPRESSIONS (Spoilers? How can you spoil garbage?)
They used to show these type of throwaways on late night local TV. For every great scary movie there has to be at least one ""Voodoo Black Exorcist,"" and yet, it's hard to imagine that someone took the trouble to create this turkey.

A bleached-out flashback beach scene of the prince and his lover running toward each in slo-mo is repeated too many times.

Every time the mummy reincarnates he's wearing different garments: in a couple of shots a gold lam Nehru jacket, in another black turtleneck and slacks, now a dark gray suit coat, collarless white shirt and brick red neck scarf. From scene to scene, the outfits change. Sequentially he's in a white turtleneck shirt and plaid gray jacket, then without explanation it's the black turtleneck again and a faintly striped coat. This monster's got more clothing combinations than Liberace!

In Port au Prince, sweating natives pound drums and other exotic percussion instruments while a barely clad big-breasted girl does an ecstatic fire dance. Meanwhile, the prince wanders corridors in search of his next victim, a man he throttles with one arm.

This guy is also into beheading with an inscripted assagai (talk about mixing cultures!).
The heads are THE fakiest papier mache affairs. Talk about a film perfect for MST3K spoofing.

Bad movies can be a hoot, but not all the time. This one just lays there like a lox.",1382140800,3,1828,4.973770491803279
8096042,1,B000C65YH6,"Let me state the obvious: This film has nothing to do with voodoo, there are no blacks in it and nary an exorcism occurs. This was filmed at the height of the blaxploitation/horror era when movies Like ""Blackenstein"" and ""Blacula"" were popular, as was a film titled ""The Exorcist.""

If you think using burnt cork to make white actors ""look black"" is a hoot (and racist), then this film will leave you shaking your head and wanting to conjure up the ghost of Al Jolson real quick. I don't know what they used to darken the skin of these untalented actors, but to me it looks like watered-down Shinola.

I own this DVD as it was part of the 50-pack ""Drive In Movie Classics"" set, but I only keep it for historical / hysterical reasons, as I am a collector of old ""classics.""

The only redeemable thing about this film is that for the most part, white producers and directors are a bit more in tune with black sensibilities.",1261353600,4,921,4.437869822485207
8096043,1,B000C65YH6,"I once owned this and have no idea why it's called  From the'Hood. What in the 'Hood are they talking about?In one feature a group of archaeologist dig up a mummy and everybody gets killed on a ship transporting the find to America. The other feature takes place in the jungle with a zombie/cannibal and a tribe that gives the monster offerings of young girls. He eats the eyeballs and entrails,then plays around with their privates. A group of kidnappers take a rich white girl and hold her for ransom in the jungle,you can guess the rest. Just don't waste your time viewing this double feature to see for yourself. The transfer is AWFUL I mean"" ATROCIOUS"".The absolute worst. Looks like they transferd this from a really bad VHS video tape. The movies themselves seemed like they could have been a riot to watch,except you can't watch this double feature because you can hardly see any thing at all. Also a lot of the nudity is blurred out. Perhaps this probally would have gotten a X rating back in the 80's when the VHS tapes of these movies surfaced. There must have been at least a good dozen scenes totally blurred out. Gave me a headache trying to view this mess. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star amazon forces you to give. Amazon really needs to correct this bulls##t. Again,I can't understand why this is called ""Terror Tales From The Hood"".The girl with the afro on the cover is a white girl with a curly 70's perm job and a slight tan by the way,in case your wondering and her scenes take place on a ship in the mummy feature. I'm all for old beat up pictures with lines,hairs and scratches. I think they add a certain charm for novelty purposes,but this is beyond beat up. Way too dark and fuzzy to enjoy at all.""Terror Tales:From the 'Hood""is my first purchase of the Terror Tales product and last.",1229212800,7,1811,4.521341463414634
8096044,1,B000C65YH6,"""Voodoo Black Exorcist"" is the only Spanish zombie movie I have seen that is worse than ""Vengeance of the Zombies."" It is technically awful, with horrible color balance (it now comes across as various hues of aqua, pale yellow, and brown), awful acting, atrocious dubbing, plodding pacing, and a ridiculous premise.

The film opens with a man and a woman (in preposterous makeup) on a beach ""in ancient Nigeria"" where they are received with some degree of hostility involving dancing and a beheading. The film then cuts to extensive stock footage of an Apollo moonshot, including scenes of lunar rendezvous and Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon while the credits roll. Your guess is as good as mine as to the point of this excursion into the cosmos: I eventually settled on the premise that it symbolized the passage of time from ancient Nigeria.

After the credits, the film cuts to a cruise ship full of unlikable people on a voyage to Haiti. The sarcophagus of the mummy from ancient Nigeria is in the cargo hold, and strange things start to happen immediately. Before it's over there is a beheading, lots of dancing, and long stretches of padding where the cameraman just walks around the ship.

The mummy awakens and befriends his escort scientist, but intermittently goes nuts with mayhem the result. The mummy takes one shore excursion, to squash Dr. Craig, a top voodoo scholar under a steamroller and assume his identity. He then begins to put the moves on Sylvia, girlfriend of the resident scientist, and goes through a long explanation about how they were once in love in Nigeria. All this winds up with the mummy, the scientist, Sylvia, and the entire Haitian police force in a cave. The movie has the least satisfying but most abrupt conclusion of any film I can remember (but the producer rented the flamethrower, and he was determined to use it). In the end nothing gets resolved, and the only emotion the viewer feels is loathing of this movie.

Even for people who normally enjoy bad movies for their camp value, I warn you: there are no redeeming qualities to be found here.",1220054400,2,2092,4.7707182320441985
