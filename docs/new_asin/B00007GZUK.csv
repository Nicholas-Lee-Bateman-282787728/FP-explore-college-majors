7976568,5,B00007GZUK,"I purchased this on a whim, mainly because I am an amateur chef and it is somewhat related. Being Italian-American was another reason. I am not going to get into the plot. Instead I'll provide some highlights that made this film a personal delight.

First, of course, is the restaurant aspect. Seeing this made me realize what a complex, choreographed process it is from the time a patron places an order until it's served. What happens in the kitchen is only a part of that process. For example, the scene where a waiter is practicing the correct pronunciation of the specials and dishes for that evening, and the other preparations portray the incredible level of detail one must manage to run a successful restaurant.

Food management 101 is not the theme of this movie, however. There is a very real storyline, but that is interwoven into the overall film. That storyline uses a lot of foreshadowing and is as intricate as the choreographed food service aspect. More importantly, the end is a big surprise. I am usually pretty good at guessing endings, but was so caught up in the characters and many back stories that I was distracted. I am sure that is part of the overall script.

One of my favorite back stories and one to which I can relate is the overarching theme between traditional and modern. The main focus is the differences of opinion between father and chef son about traditional Italian food and noveau Italian cuisine. It also extends to mob related activities to a lesser degree, especially in the opening scenes.

After watching this the first time I realized that I missed a lot of clues because my attention was more on the food and management aspects, as well as the back stories. A few more viewings revealed just how beautifully crafted the script was, and what a masterpiece of a whodunit this movie really is.

It's almost like a three ring circus, so when you watch it keep your eyes on the clowns. Buon appetito.",1446076800,2,1943,4.686217008797654

7976570,5,B00007GZUK,"Dinner Rush demands attention, but it is as rewarding as a good meal to the engaged viewer. Every single performance is brilliant, and buildup in tension to the payoff is like the bending of a longbow until it snaps.",1414281600,,216,4.564102564102564
7976571,4,B00007GZUK,"The director of this somewhat dark comedy, Bob Giraldi, is also owner of the restaurant where the picture was filmed.

In DINNER RUSH, a hearty-eatin' Italian restaurant that's been in the family four generations has been transformed by Aiello's master chef son into a trendy Tribecca trattoria, a place where you cannot find a meatball.

After his partner of 25 years (Bongiomo) is murdered by two thugs from Queens, restaurateur and small-time numbers man Aiello invites the killers to dinner. Also present at Danny's request are a NYC detective and his wife.

Not hard to figure out where this one's going but it's still an enjoyable movie.
