3045329,3,B00104AYSI,"The jokes in the latest Farrelly Brothers comedy are fast and furious. It's just too bad they couldn't find a heart to hang them from. ""The Heartbreak Kid"" starts off promisingly enough, when Ben Stiller seems to finally find the girl he may actually be a match with. But then Lila (Malin Akerman, channeling Cameron Diaz) turns out to be the HellBride of Doom, and Stiller winds up trapped in Cabo with a woman he can't get away from.

About now is when the movie makes a sudden turn off a cliff, in my mind. Instead of keeping Stiller's Eddie as a lovable schmo who has to wrestle the situation with smarts and heart, he turns into an absolute heel. He meets the Mississippi lady on vacation with her family Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and before you can say ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" Stiller is aping every bad man-sex cliche he can. Miranda's family are played as one-dimensional buffoons for most of the movie, and the piling on of the gross-out jokes reaches a climactic peak of awful when a very large chunk of carpet with a piercing shows up. At that point, I just groaned and wondered what had happened to the two guys who made the classic ""There's Something About Mary"" and the sweetly funny ""Fever Pitch."" Because ""The Heartbreak Kid"" is both misogynistic and misanthropic, loading up the stupid human tricks till you wonder if the idea was to make a movie so heartless that you could better understand why ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" are so brilliantly funny.

That's not to say there aren't some funny spots. The sex scenes are screamingly hilarious the first few times before wearing thin. Jerry Stiller plays Eddie's dad as an over-sexed lout and gets the film's best lines. Rob Corddry jumps away from his Daily Show life to be a scene stealing p-ssy-whipped husband, and the Donkey Dance is a classic set piece. Even the overlong scenes of Eddie trying to get back into America were pretty funny, as they were some of the too few moments that took advantage of Stiller's good-natured comedic skills. Too bad it doesn't all add up to a coherent film. If you think I am being too harsh, go back and rent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Me-Myself-Irene/dp/B00003CXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Me, Myself & Irene</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-About-Mary/dp/B0006GANPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something About Mary</a>&nbsp;to remind yourself just how brilliant the Farralleys can be.",1192406400,,2518,5.30827067669173
3045330,3,B00104AYSI,"Ben Stiller is a 40 year old bachelor who doesn't see the point in settling down. But after he is forced to sit at the singles table with a few children at his ex's wedding, he decides to at least embrace the thoughts of a relationship.

He accidentally ""rescues"" a Marine Biologist who was doing laundry named Lila by attempting to fight off a purse snatcher who gets away. She tracks him down at a store he owns and they start to date. But after only 6 weeks of dating, she discovers she has to leave the country to follow her career. She is the only person that can do it, because she is the only one who is not married. Armed with all the Pro's(none of the con's)of marrying Lila from his married friend, his father (Ben Stiller's on screen and off screen father), and a couple of bratty twins at a wedding, he decides to exchange vows with Lila.

The road trip to their honeymoon in Mexico turns out to be a little more than he bargained for, because her singing goes from cute to hilariously annoying as she sing along to every single song on the radio, from every genre of music. The honeymoon is where Ben discovers she MAY not be the girl for him. Turns out there was a lot about her that he did not know, like her wild sexual habits, her deviated septum and how she got it, details of her past relationships, and her career goals. In the midst of it all, he meets a down to earth woman who he falls deeply for, but does not know how to tell his current wife that he wants to leave her, or the woman he fell in love with that he is on his honeymoon and exchanged vows less than a week ago.

I rated the movie a 3 out of 5 only because the character Ben Stiller was not very likeable. He married before knowing the person he was going to marry and was not hesitant to leave his wife for someone who he thought was better meaning he didn't take marriage seriously. Ben Stiller played a scripted character beautifully but me being a woman, it was character that I really didn't care for by the end of the movie, a character which we found did not seem to learn from his mistakes.

All in all, the movie was very enjoyable, but usually the main character is someone who we could relate to, sympathize with, and fall in love with by the end of the movie. But by the end of this movie, I really wanted to slap Ben Stiller's character in the face with a jellyfish and watch him squirm and then call Lila to ""soothe"" it like she did when he stumbled upon our tentacled friend.....",1192406400,,2481,4.205882352941177
3045331,4,B00104AYSI,"Eddie (Ben Stiller) is a bachelor approaching 40 who, following his ex-girlfriend's wedding, is feeling increasing pressure to get married. He meets and begins dating a woman named Lila (Malin Akerman). But she says work will force her to move to Rotterdam if they don't get married right away. Eddie takes the bait and jumps into a quickie marriage with a woman he hardly knows. But Eddie soon realizes he has married the wife from hell. While on their honeymoon to Cabo, Eddie meets Miranda (Michelle Monaguay). Eddie has much more in common with this fun, intelligent and down to earth gal and the two fall madly in love. But Eddie never tells Miranda the truth about already being married and, following a big misunderstanding, she heads back home to Mississippi with her family. The film ends with a final strange plot twist that I won't give away.

The ""Heartbreak Kid"" is very loosely based on a 1972 comedy starring Charles Grodin and Cybil Shepard. But, of course, here the movie is given the classic Farrelly Brothers treatment, with lots of over the top gags and raunchy jokes. I did get enough laughs from the movie to make it worth seeing. But I don't think it is quite as original and funny as the the best Farrelly Brother's films, such as ""Something About Mary."" I most enjoyed the first half, the roadtrip and early honeymoon scenes are hilarious and Lila truly is a man's worst nightmare. The second half is OK and Miranda is certainly a likable character. But the story bogs down a bit and the laughs don't come at quite the same fast and furious pace.

Still this is a well made comedy and fans of the Farrelly Brothers extreme style of humor will want to see it.",1192233600,,1683,4.6066666666666665
3045332,3,B00104AYSI,"Now that he's single after losing his fiance (Ali Hallis), Eddie Cantrow is wandering aimlessly, unsure of what he wants in a companion. He makes it on the rebound when he meets a young lady named Lila (Malin Akerman). Six weeks into the relationship, Lila tells Eddie that she'll have to move away for two years as part of her job requirement. After being goaded by his dad (Jerry Stiller) and best friend (Rob Corddry), Eddie decides to marry Lila on the spot, and they take a honeymoon in Mexico. But it's at that point that Lila shows her true colors as a total annoyance. Eddie now regrets what he has done, and his troubles are about to rise when he meets the real woman for him, Mississippi high school teacher Miranda (Michelle Monaghan).

I'm sort of disappointed with Peter and Bobby Farrelly's return to raunchy comedy, The Heartbreak Kid. It's been seven years since they've explored this territory after Me, Myself & Irene ate up box office numbers in 2000. Since then, David Dobkin and Judd Apatow took over with their raunchy classics (I think we all know the movie titles, so I won't get into it). While The Heartbreak Kid aces Superbad in terms of narrative and laughs, I'm still at different ends whether or not to support this film or forget about it.

And I'm a Ben Stiller fan, as is everybody else. Reuniting with his partners in crime since The Heartbreak Kid, Stiller carries the film and balances his patented neurotic acts and comedic frustrations that have been missed for quite some time. He's even complimented by a strong cast, which includes Michelle Monaghan, finally free of Tom Cruise's clutches post-Mission: Impossible III, Malin Akerman (don't be surprised if she takes some roles away from Anna Faris; this is a true breaktrhough performance as Isla Fisher's in Wedding Crashers), Rob Corddry (who finally makes a solid debut after some disappointing co-starring roles), Jerry Stiller (at his best, as always), and even Carlos Mencia (a wickedly underrated comedian who is funnier than George Lopez).

But the Farrellys jumped the ball with Danny R. McBride. Fresh off the semi-success of Hot Rod, it seems like McBride has taken Dan Fogler's crappy comedy agenda and just be irritating as possible. He plays the overprotective cousin character with a whole lot of indication. While it's not a method-abusing performance, McBride eventually wears thin on the viewer trying too hard to be funny, but coming off like a jerk-off. Even the scene where she shoves a chili pepper up Ben Stiller's nose had the chance to be a laugh-riot, but his overbearing presence kills that chance.

Another problem is that the film is quite long. Much like Superbad, The Heartbreak Kid starts off as a traditional comedy with every trademark comedy bit from the director. As I stated, Ackerman's willingness to have fun (and get naked as well) is the most endearing part of the film, and the raucous sex scenes are fall-down hilarious. And then there's the scene with a donkey dry-humping a woman that will be chalked up as another Farrelly brother highlight.

But once the film gets to the point where nothing can go wrong, it does. Most of the film is a light-as-a-feather sex farce, yet as the film gets close to the end, the Farrely brothers start to lose steam as they struggle for a conclusion that becomes disheartening. While it does make room for some good laughs (including one where Eddie joins a group of illegal aliens to get back to America, and growing lots of facial hair in the process), there are long chasms of scenes that make little or no sense (most including McBride), and the ending, while realistic, sort of left me in the cold. I won't tell you what happens, but there's an appearance from an overexposed celebrity who is shoved in my face (and the public's I'm sure).

Maybe it's the fact that Judd Apatow is now taking over where they left off. But the Farrelly bros. dropped the ball with this film. Oh, yes, there are laughs, but it ain't the laugh riot that they've been known for. Better luck next time, I guess?",1192147200,,4063,4.756028368794326

This is a redoing of a film of the same name from 1972, which featured Elaine May as Director, and perhaps to a degree, writer.  The modern film [2007] by the Farrelly brothers, is not as serious and dead pan, but it is a decided improvement being due to the fact that it is broadly speaking lighter fare, and offering larger scope.  The Farrelly's attempt to be more illustrative of the man's side, while nonetheless retaining the whimsical comedy and basic dignity that was so characteristic of the Elaine May and Mike Nichols movies of the 60s/70s, and which made them in a manner so charming and notable.  A refinement of the original vision, therefore, and highly recommended.",1449792000,,815,4.792857142857143

3045547,2,B00104AYSI,"The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, make comedies.  Some of them, like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" are funny.  Some of them, like ""Kingpin"" and ""Fever Pitch,"" are only so-so; and others, like ""Osmosis Jones"" and ""Shallow Hal,"" are outright duds.  Count 2007's ""The Heartbreak Kid"" among the duds.  Well, at least the movie is a dud; the video quality of this Blu-ray edition is outstanding.  Small compensation.

The Farrellys have always had a playful mean streak in them, and they have often worked physical or mental disabilities into their films:  stupid people, obese people, mentally challenged people, one-handed people, sick people.  But in their adaptation of the 1972 Neil Simon-Elaine May movie of the same title, they seem just plain malicious.

Let me give you the setup first.  Ben Stiller plays a forty-year-old confirmed bachelor, Eddie Cantrow.  He owns a sporting goods store in San Francisco, and he seems content.  However, no one around him is content about his being unattached, including his father (played by Ben Stiller's real-life father, Jerry Stiller).  When Eddie goes to his ex-fiancee's wedding, practically everybody there ridicules him for still being single.

Then he meets a pretty blonde, Lila (Malin Akerman), who sweeps him off his feet.  After a whirlwind courtship, he marries her, and on their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas, the trouble starts.  Eddie realizes too late that he doesn't really know her.  Among other things, she talks and sings constantly, she won't shut up, she's a lot more aggressive than he realized, and she has any number of distasteful secrets that he just now finds out.  She is, in fact, pretty obnoxious, and he begins to have his doubts about having married her.

That's when he meets Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a young woman visiting Cabo with her family, and he falls in love with her.  So, that's the premise:  What do you do when on your honeymoon you realize you've made a huge mistake in marrying the wrong person and simultaneously find the real girl of your dreams?

What seemed humorous and daring thirty-odd years ago in Neil Simon's screenplay seems merely cruel in the Farrellys' rewritten account.  What we get here is a new wife who's an idiot and a new husband who's a cad, a liar, and an idiot.

The Farrellys' fill ""The Heartbreak Kid"" with crude language, crude jokes, and crude sex, little of which is even faintly amusing.  The gags are often of the slapstick variety, especially the ones that portray Lila as a klutz.  OK, I did find myself giggling briefly at one salacious scene where Eddie's dad is in a hot tub in Vegas with a woman of prodigious breast size.  But the rest of the film is almost painfully unfunny.

The misunderstandings that follow the film's setup are sometimes genuinely unbearable to watch, and the movie only gets worse as it goes along.  I found it largely gross, mean-spirited, frustrating, and ugly.

Final note:  When DreamWorks released ""The Heartbreak Kid"" to theaters, it carried an R rating for ""strong sexual content, crude humor and language.""  Here on Blu-ray, it continues with an R rating, yet we also find the following message preceding the movie:  ""This film has been modified from its original theatrical version.  It has been edited for content.""  Make of that what you will.

Video:
It's hard to find fault with the dual-layer BD50, 1080p, MPEG4/AVC transfer.  Indeed, it's so good it tends to reinforce my axiom that the worse the movie, the better the video quality.  The transfer retains the movie's 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio and the movie's robust colors.  Indeed, the colors are so bright and vivid, they fairly pop off the screen, which is perhaps a bit too much of a good thing because they are brighter and more vivid than real life.  I suppose the colors are appropriate, though, for a comedy that exaggerates life the way this one does.  Definition is good, skin tones are natural, clarity is exceptional, and black levels are deep.  Interior detailing is also good, and from a normal viewing distance the picture looks downright gorgeous.

Audio:
The English track's Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sounds fine, given that it has virtually nothing to do but reproduce dialogue and some fragments of forgettable background music.  It handles the job nicely, with overkill the order of the day.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc contains the usual assortment of extras, some of them even having to do with the movie.  The first thing up is an audio commentary by the film's directors, the Farrelly brothers.  They're surprisingly serious; somehow, I expected them to be joking through the whole commentary.  Next is a series of four featurettes.  The first is ""The Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition,"" about sixteen minutes long, providing a little history of the brothers in filmmaking.  Second is ""Ben & Jerry,"" five minutes about the Stillers, father and son, working together.  Third is ""Heartbreak Halloween,"" three minutes about a Halloween party the cast and crew had on the set.  And fourth is ""The Egg Toss,"" eight minutes about the egg tosses on the set.  Then there's a gag reel, four minutes, and six deleted scenes, about seven-and-a-half minutes.  All of these items are in standard definition.

Things conclude with sixteen scene selections and bookmarks; a high-def theatrical trailer; a guide to elapsed time; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
If this new Farrelly brothers version of Neil Simon's ""The Heartbreak Kid"" does anything good, it may be to send viewers out looking for the original 1972 movie.  That one wasn't the height of comedic genius, but at least it wasn't as joyless as this depressingly downbeat remake.",1433548800,,5829,5.007284079084287

I don't know if its high-horse-itude or being Poindexters, or just having a really grown up approach to comedies, but this is > not < a smart comedy. In fact, its a really, really ""stupid comedy"" -- but big time funny if you're into similar movies.  To help you decide, here is my opinionated preference guide:
Which is funnier:
1. Dumb and Dumber or any movie with Hugh Grant?
2. Anchorman or When Harry Met Sally?
I could go on, but my point is this: I gave this 5 stars in the context of comparing it to other comedies. I cant argue in a film class that this is a ""5 star film. Comparing it to the classics, it may even be forgettable.  But if you still call them movies (not films), and you like physical comedy or Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, etc, this is well worth the low price.",1403222400,,972,4.260869565217392

3045657,5,B00104AYSI,"If you are expecting a traditional romantic comedy, this is not it.  It is more like a spoof of a romantic comedy, with jokes that can get very vulgar.  So if those kinds of comedies are not something you find entertaining, then stay away from this one.

The plot is pretty simple.  A lifelong bachelor finally decides to get married, but only after knowing the bride for a few weeks.  On the way to, and during the honeymoon he discovers she is totally crazy.  Malin Ackerman totally plays up the crazy role, and runs with the totally over the top jokes.  The part of the movie that is the more traditional romantic comedy, is when Stiller's character meets a new love interest on his honeymoon, and tries to woo her, all while trying to keep her from learning about his wife.

This is definitely not a movie for kids or one for those who don't like the kind of humor.  There is a lot of swearing, nudity and sex jokes in it.  If you do like those kinds of movies, then it is worth checking out.",1365379200,,996,4.306451612903226

These characters are repulsive and the acting is too slow. The shock value of the Farrelly Brothers is just a cheap (and dirty) trick. So I feel like I should have known better, but nonetheless, this movie is completely degrading towards women, sex, and not actually a satiric depiction of dating, just gross.",1363219200,,474,4.654761904761905

I was surprised to see the black screen pop up at the beginning saying, ""this movie has been edited for content."" Hmm. They usually only do that on TV. It's just as well, because if that was the edited version, I'd hate to see the unedited version! Half the movies you see these days have unnecessary sex scenes in them, so this movie was not worse than MANY other movies. The language and the innuendo I would say went beyond funny bordering on gross. Some of it was funny, but most of it just makes you cringe.

The real problem comes when you cannot sympathize with the main character. His new wife did not have a complete personality change the instant they got married, like the previews implied. He was just a guy with no patience. So his wife likes to sing along to music in the car. Well, that's great. Most people would get bored and irritable and complain on a long car trip. Maybe he should be grateful!

I happen to love him and think this movie was hilarious.  There were some dull moments and maybe one or two that leave you shaking your head for a second, but seriously, what movie has your interest and is completely perfect 100% of the time?

There are lines from the movie (that I saw last well over a year ago) that I quote on a regular....the movie was just funny!

The movie can be quite raunchy and vulgar in some areas so you'll really never see a TV version that comes close to the original.  Note that some of the raunchy scenes are incredibly funny - all the more reason for owning the DVD.

The story line is witty and funny and the chemistry between all of the characters is very good.  Just don't watch with kids around as some sex scenes can be a little more than you'd expect from a Ben Stiller movie.  I don't buy many DVD's but this was a must own for me.

Special Note:

I think the rating is somewhat dumbed down on Amazon due to the fact that they offer an HD DVD version for very cheap.  HD DVD is NOT Blu-ray and wil become a coaster.

3045687,1,B00104AYSI,"Rarely do I hand out a one-star rating for a movie, because surely no movie can be THAT bad. But as I discovered with ""The Heartbreak Kid"", it is indeed possible. I literally hated this movie, and was repulsed beyond anything I'd seen before.

The movie opens normally enough, and even showed promise- with a cameo from actor Ben Stiller's real dad, Jerry, the movie could have followed Ben and his real dad into Las Vegas, and become a ""The Hangover""-esque film, for which I could have forgiven it. But the film derails as soon as it introduced the pretty, seemingly perfect Lila, whom Eddie (Ben Stiller) decides to marry on a whim. On their honeymoon, Lila becomes increasingly creepy and odd, causing Eddie to hate his snap decision to marry the woman he barely knew- especially when he meets someone else.

The whole film is a disaster. Crude to the point of cringing, blatantly cussing where it was hardly appopriate (the line, ""Let's go to a motel and f**k"" disgusted me), and downright embarrassing for stars like Ben Stiller and Michelle Monaghan to be attached to such a film, ""The Heartbreak Kid"" is one of the worst films you'll ever see.

Branching off quickly and wildly from the hasty marriage between Lila and Eddie to their honeymoon on a beautiful island, the films spins out of control, as if the directors got bored and rapidly began shooting ideas- which they all agreed to keep. The love-triangle between Eddie, Lila, and Michelle Monaghan's character, Miranda, is awkward and weird. The shocking crudeness was over the top, and leaves a bad taste that overshadows the attempts at humor.

The film feels like several writers were undecided on what kind of film to write. Some parts are clearly a romantic comedy, while others are severely crude and flat gross-outs. In the end, it branches off into an ending so bizarre and unsatisfying that I turned off the TV. The third act made no sense, and for the first time, I truly felt disgustingly cheated out of an hour and fourty minutes of my life.

""The Heartbreak Kid"" messes with the traditional romantic-movie formula, lacks heart, and tries vulgarity where it ruins the scenes. There's just no soul whatever to the film, and it feels pieced together imperfectly, trampling over you and leaving the viewer with a twisted, gross, unhappy feeling in their gut.

So the bottom line? The Farrelly Brothers have spawned several movies I've grown to hate, and this movie tops the list. I was throughly disappointed, because this movie could have been a lot funnier and sweeter if they had only cut out some of the scarring scenes. Buy it if you like, but when you turn off the TV, revolted, like I did: well, let's just say, I told you so.",1296259200,5,2706,4.7224576271186445
3045688,2,B00104AYSI,"I hate to start by saying `The Heartbreak Kid' is an extremely weak film and a huge disappointment. From the trailer this looks to be a typical funny Ben Stiller film, but you quickly realise that the best scenes are shown in the trailer and furthermore they are less funny when in the context of the film! There are unnecessarily crass moments in this film and rather than making you laugh, they make you double take and question how appropriate they are. There is also use of the `C' word which was completely out of place, out of keeping with the feel of the film and completely inappropriate. Generally I have no problem with crass jokes, or even use of the `C' word, but only in context and particular genres of film, these elements were out of step with what is marketed as a light hearted comedy. Sadly to say, after seeing Stiller in other funny films, this film has very little to offer and although it raises a chuckle in places it left me bored by the end and waiting for it's conclusion. Worth a look if you're a HUGE fan of Ben Stiller, otherwise you can give it a miss and not lose any sleep.

3045689,5,B00104AYSI,Its funny on TV but even funnier on DVD b/c no censorship.  The scenes w/nudity or graphic content contribute to the humor and serve to highlight the big differences between this mis-matched couple.,1289779200,,198,5.0
3045692,3,B00104AYSI,"A movie of this title starring Ben Stiller is bound to be hit, or at least worth its weight in laughs.  So when I saw this film, I was not disappointed, yet I found the visual aspects of a few over-the-top sex scenes rather raunchy and certainly not necessary for the humor this crazed plot and Stiller's comic appeal readily provided.

Tired of getting teased for his bachelorhood, Eddie Cantrow was quick to fall for the first pretty damsel in distress he befriended on a city street.  With the urging of Stiller's real-life and on-screen dad, this leading character marries who he believes to be the girl of his dreams. Two minutes into his honeymoon, he begins to have second thoughts that keep escalating until he realizes he's in his worst nightmare and not about to wake up anytime soon.

The only comforting part of this bad dream is the presence of Miranda, another woman on vacation with her family at the same resort where Eddie is honeymooning.  Afraid of losing Miranda and equally fearful of hurting his wife, it is easy for the viewer to sympathize with Stiller's character.  But Miranda's family is a frying pan waiting for Eddie to leap into after the fire.  Miranda herself proves to be not too stable, and Eddie has enough character flaws to deserve both women and plenty more.

While this movie was definitely funny, what I liked best was its unpredictable and open ending.  It was not the quick fix, or rescue scene, or typical ending I had in mind when I saw the previews.  For a few laughs, I would recommend this video - but put kids to bed first.",1285632000,,1571,4.578571428571428

3045694,2,B00104AYSI,"This film is not nearly as funny as it should be.  It was nowhere close to ""There's Something About Mary.""  Ben Stiller did a surprisingly good acting job in the film, but the film itself was not consistently laugh-out-loud, and I generally laugh at stupid, silly films that have the raunchy scenes that this film had.  What makes matters worse is that this film is based on the screenplay by Neil Simon.  Neil Simon plays are funny mainly because the lines are good.  This film seemed to lack the clever script and instead focused on sex and swearing, which can be funny in other films, but I think the fact that I saw and really enjoyed the original version of this film made me realize how less superior this one is.  In addition, for some reason, this DVD has been edited from the original version.  That seems absurd to me.  Yes, the DVD contains many Rated R scenes, but why the original version is not being sold is beyond me.  That in itself reduced my rating by one star.",1279756800,,980,4.430167597765363
3045695,4,B00104AYSI,"Talk about a movie that takes you, spins your head around in circles and dumps you all over the place the Heartbreak Kid breaks a lot of rules of film making and comedy and does it well.

It tells the story of a single guy Ben Stiller who is unable to find a woman, his sex obsessed father (played by his father Jerry) and his best pal Mac who are all looking to get him married off.

The movie starts to get you invested in his plight as he goes from embarrassment to embarrassment until he seems to come across the right girl, Lila.

In a mere 5 weeks pushed by his father and friend he marries her, and it is on the drive down to their honeymoon retreat to Mexico that things get interesting...

...that's where he meets the girl of his dreams, Miranda.

From here the plot twist and turns from disaster to disaster, in terms of the comedy the Farrellys set you up for every turn from Carlos Mencia through Miranda's family to the twins who after a brief introduction at the beginning of the film are used for great comic effect.  The reaction of his father and best friends to his martial problems made me instantly think of the famous Three Stooges short&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Collection-Volume-2/dp/B0006BECCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges Collection Volume 2</a>&nbsp;Husbands Beware.

The comedy becomes so odd and the situations so ridiculous (one scene with Jerry Stiller on the phone with his son from Vegas still gives me the shudders) that you don't know what to do.  The Farrellys slowly build up sympathy for Eddie as the film and then slowly bit by bit start to remove it until you wonder if you want him to get the girl of his dreams.

When you see the final scene (not counting the Easter egg with the Donkey)you realize who and what these characters are.  It is a very disarming experience.

Oh and don't do what I did, I watched it directly after seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trade/dp/B000YIGND6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trade</a>&nbsp;talk about getting your head and mind twisted all over the place.

This film is so not for kids it isn't funny, there are at least two sex scenes where I wonder how the actors involved managed to keep a straight face.  I couldn't do it.  Paradoxically it is, in many ways, a morality play, all the wrong and foolish decisions have all the consequences they should have, in at least one case tragic results.  So on second thought maybe you should make your teenage daughters watch it and Learn!

It is slapstick, it is deep comedy, it is sexual comedy, it is mind games, it is a morality play, it is cheep bawdy humor all rolled up into one brilliant package!

My wife turned this movie on while I was fielding some email, and I would peek up every now and then to see what she was watching.  My wife is a big ""romantic comedy"" and chick flick lover, so when I saw Ben Stiller, I zoned out thinking it was probably some crap like ""Along Came Polly"".  But then I saw that Stiller was playing the ""annoyed guy"" role and started watching more, then laughing, then launched IMDb and saw that it was a Farrelly Brothers film and started to get into it.  My wife went to bed halfway through it and I continued the movie in the bedroom and laughed my butt off!

Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Now just because it's a Farrelly Brothers movie, didn't guarantee that it would be a good or funny movie.  They've got some bombs in their catalog.  But ""Heartbreak Kid"" is definitely a 4 out of 5 stars.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say it's a 7.5.  Not great.  But entertaining as all hell!

I would suspect that people that got offended by this movie, are the types of people that get offended by films by Kevin Smith, Todd Philips, the Wayans and probably even Judd Apatow.

 It is R rated for a reason....in fact, I would say several very funny reasons. And Stiller, along with all the cast, proves that they have not only depth of character, but a sense of humor for electing to be in it.

Don't get me wrong, this movie does have several funny moments; I was literally rolling on the floor with one particular scene involving Carlos Mencia as the 'victim' of a vicious hand slap.  Yet the film doesn't work for a myriad of reasons, the most obvious one being Ben Stiller's character.  When the story begins, Stiller plays a commitment-evasive guy who finally takes the plunge and marries what he thinks is his 'dream girl.'  Trouble is, she's his Nightmare on Elm Street; so our protagonist feels compelled to lie, manipulate, connive, trick, thwart, deceive, and weave to get into the good graces of a new woman he's met. . .on his honeymoon.  Of course, the more he dodges and weaves, the more trouble he finds himself in--surely, by the end of the film, a golden lesson has been learned?

By the end, alas, Stiller's character is still a liar, manipulator, conniver, trickster, thwarter, deceiver, and dodge 'n weaver (this guy oughta run for office).  I discovered I didn't give two cents about him at the beginning of the film, and the character sure didn't appreciate in value by the end.  Heads up:  This is not your favorite aunt's 'There's Something About Mary'. . .there are some eye-popping scenes that are definitely not for the faint of heart.  Maybe that's why this turkey is called THE HEARTBREAK KID.  Might be on to something.

In other words, leave your brain at the door and get down to those base instincts when you watch one of his flicks: hunger, sex ...and more sex. And THE HEARTBREAK KID is no exception.

And so the story goes...

Eddie (Stiller) is having commitment issues. He seems destined to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>, but without the virginity. He just can't find the right gal to marry and looks to be headed toward loneliness in his latter years. This is proven to be correct when he's invited to an ex-girlfriend's wedding and has to sit at the singles' table which is surrounded by 12 year olds. His father Doc (real-life father Jerry Stiller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hairspray/dp/B000W4KT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hairspray</a>) doesn't have much sound advice, nor does his best friend Mac (Rob Corddry,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Failure-to-Launch/dp/B000FILV1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Failure to Launch</a>). His father is only interested in the carnal portions of any relationship, while Mac is so whipped by his wife he can't do or go anywhere without her knowing it (his personalized ring-tone for her is hilarious, by the way).

But then Eddie meets Lila (Malin Akerman) and his life seems to have found its partner ...until they go on their honeymoon. ""Like a switch"" being turned, Lila begins to exhibit some very unusual behavior, including rough sex talk (and rough sex itself) and information about her life that startles Eddie (""I thought you worked?"") After Lila gets a nasty sunburn, Eddie heads out onto the beaches of Cabo and meets the girl of his dreams. Her name is Miranda (Michelle Monaghan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-Baby-Gone/dp/B0010ZR160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone Baby Gone</a>) and she's on vacation with her father, mother, cousins, and brothers. The two spark immediately and Eddie feels the need to get out of his new marriage and into something of more ...umm ...stability with Miranda.

Miscommunications and deceit are the nature with which Eddie finds himself lost in the quagmire of newlywedism and true love.

Bit parts move the film along, including a typical nasty role from Carlos Mencia as Tito, a perverted employee at the hotel where Eddie is staying; and Roy Jenkins as Buzz, Miranda's brother and protector who shoves a few things where they don't belong when he learns of Eddie's deception.

The film's most troubling aspect, though, is that it jumps around a lot and loses focus. From Carlos Mencia placing his ""thing"" in Lila's hand, to a very long section about Eddie trying to get back to America and having to go ""wet-back"" in order to do so, these diversions really hurt the main portions of the film.

But the surprise ending really helped the story tremendously. I won't give it away, but I will say that it surprised me greatly; I hadn't seen it coming but it was perfectly in line with what probably would've actually happened.

Just remember, though, it's still comedy-lite.

This movie is excruciatingly bad for the first half and only mildly redeems itself in the second half. A really off mix of extreme ""'raunch' & romance!"" One of the biggest problems is Stiller's newlywed wife is so obnoxious, you grow tired of watching her and just want to throw her down the nearest elevator shaft! I realize this is the intended response to her, but there's a fine line to walk when you want an audience to stay interested.

The humor is pretty raunchy which doesn't bother me so much, but I was watching this one with my 80+ year old parents! lol! Which had me wincing a few times, wondering how they would react to this vulgar humor. They did survive this uneven mess and actually liked it to a degree because of the relationship between Stiller and his new love interest.

3045762,2,B00104AYSI,"The Heartbreak Kid is a 2007 remake of a 1972 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/with-the-same-name/dp/6304836627/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">with the same name</a>.  Having never seen the original film but knowing that it is cited as pretty funny for its time, I fail to see how any of the lame cheap jokes in this remake that caught me with a few guilty impulsive chuckles could've received any reaction other than disgust in 1972, as it probably does even today.  Suffice to say, I think that means that as a remake this movie fails miserably, but I can't be sure.  So, I am judging The Heartbreak Kid strictly on its own merit, and this movie sucks.

The Farrelly brothers, who brought us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dumb-and-Dumber/dp/0780618556/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dumb and Dumber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-About-Mary/dp/B0006GANP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something About Mary</a>, put this mish-mash together using Ben Stiller as its main protagonist.  This also stars a disposable Michelle Monaghan and the completely unfunny Carlos Mencia.  Rob Corddy is funny in a few scenes as Stiller's best friend but Danny McBride and Jerry Stiller are not the least bit funny in roles where they are really trying hard to be. The only person who shouldn't feel at least moderately ashamed is Malin kerman, who manages to be exceptionally funny and overall pretty great in an awful production.  The story is basically about how Eddie (Stiller) marries Lila (kerman) and finds out after they marry that he made a huge mistake.  The Farrelly gross-out shenanigans ensue with a fraction of the charm that exists in their prior films.  Lila is disgusting in many ways and really, her scenes revealing these things are all that is funny about The Heartbreak Kid.  Soon, Eddie, on his Honeymoon no less, falls for another girl named Miranda (Monaghan) and we are supposed to care and root for him.

I don't blame Stiller as much as I'd like to.  I blame whoever thought the audience would want to identify with a pathetically weak and morally deficient jerk like Eddie.  On the other side of that coin, we are also expected to enjoy the demise of kerman's character and find humor in her pain.  Sure, she can be gross with her deviated septum and annoying for her taste in music, but people have flaws.  I actually kind of liked her, especially after her bedroom scenes, and I respected her even more after her heroics on the beach after Eddie was attacked by a jellyfish.  The contrast I'm sure the Farrelly brothers were looking for was her zany and shallow behavior combined with her model looks.  Everyone just hates a gal like that, don't they? That's all well and good but Stiller's Eddie is far more shallow and he is also incredibly dull.  Furthermore, Monaghan's Miranda is just as dull as Eddie.  It is very clear who the Farrellys want us to root for, but I was rooting for the doomed Lila all along.  Obviously, that could ruin anyone's viewing experience.

This is almost two-hours of watching Ben Stiller whine his way from scene to scene with very little to laugh at, and I guess we are all supposed to whine right along with him.  This is probably not worth a moment of your time, but kerman is definitely a talent to watch out for.",1211414400,3,3429,5.299445471349353
3045763,2,B00104AYSI,"When the lonely Eddie (Ben Stiller) meets the perky, young, blonde woman of his dreams, Lila (Malin Akerman), in Paramount's The Heartbreak Kid, the audience immediately expects something to be wrong with her because she seems to genuinely laugh at his bumbling, neurotic behavior.  Somehow, even after forty-plus years of chronic bachelor behavior, he is convinced she is the one for him--despite not really knowing anything about her-- and they marry.  Of course minutes after the fact, though, when they embark on a road trip on their honeymoon, he begins to see her in a new light and progressively regrets his decision--mostly do to the fact that he meets another woman, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and becomes convinced she is ""the one,"" despite not knowing her at all either.  Directed by the Farrelly brothers, The Heartbreak Kid is indecisive not only in the individual characters' decisions but on the whole in the tone of the film itself.  It rides the line between bittersweet comedy and painfully awkward profanity, all things Stiller and both Farrellys are known for taking on (and doing so successfully) in the past.  Unfortunately here, that tired, old formula is just plain painful.

When Lila's ""quirks,"" shall we say, first start coming to light, you can't help but wonder why Eddie isn't just blinded by the love he supposedly had for her only seconds before on-screen.  Instead, though, he is utterly annoyed and horrified, and completely writes her off, even though--while exaggerated--those little bits of character, such as singing along to every little thing on the radio, are ultimately harmless.  He even leaves her nursing a sunburn to drink and flirt with Miranda at the hotel bar; he is the epitome of the anti-hero, and he is completely dislikeable as a lead.  The Farrelly's The Heartbreak Kid is a poor attempt at remaking the 1970s version starring Charles Grodin and Cybil Shepard.  In fact, it is still unclear why one would need a new version of an unflashy, morally objective film in the first place.  There are no CGI additions, and the star power of Stiller alone is not nearly enough to save this less-than-mediocre attempt.

The Heartbreak Kid is full of tantrum-throwing caricatures, with the sole exception of Monaghan's Miranda, who is not really developed enough to form a knowledgeable opinion.  Therefore, the special features on the DVD must be relied upon to offer insight into the direction of said characters.  Unfortunately, though, all the audio commentary showcases is that the stereotypical portrayal, mostly on Stiller's part, was not so much direction as a lack thereof.  Nepotism runs rampant in Hollywood, but working with your friends time and again has become a worse syndrome, and the Farrellys prove that in the commentary, sharing stories how about how utterly fun it was to be in Stiller's presence on-set everyday.  They may have shared some laughs in rehearsals and at lunch, but that humor certainly didn't translate to the scenes as scripted.

The ""Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition"" is a talking-heads documentary in the directors' own words about how they got started in the film industry and worked their way up from indie comedies.  Of course there are also six deleted scenes and what the DVD calls a gag reel but is really more of a musical montage of the cast laughing and mumbling when they didn't seem to realize the camera was already rolling.  The few tidbits from Jerry Stiller actually elicit chuckling, though, and to expand on the humor he offers, ""Ben & Jerry"" is a five-minute featurette about what it was like for the two generations of Stillers to together for the umpteenth time but finally play father and son on-screen.

""Heartbreak Halloween"" is a quick but comical behind-the-scenes look at production on Halloween, when the entire crew came dressed in costumes.  ""The Egg Toss"" is another behind-the-scenes look at the cast and crew, this time featuring a weekly egg toss competition in the downtime on-set.  The addition of these two features on the DVD seems like yet another desperate attempt to show that the crew had fun making the movie... maybe so you should feel like you have to have fun while watching it?  If more features such as these are what the audience can expect as the Youtube generation gradually takes over, it would be greatly advised to salvage a few minutes of your life and just skip them.

To top off this oddly somber viewing experience, the DVD also features previews for some similar comedies, some of which have not yet been released (Drillbit Taylor), some that are also now available on DVD (Hot Rod), and one that is just a shameless plug for one of the film's stars other projects (Mind of Mencia: Season 3 Uncensored).  None of these sound particularly groundbreaking, and yet after The Heartbreak Kid, it has to be assumed that any one of them is funnier than the film featured on this disc.",1210982400,,4931,4.940677966101695

3045765,2,B00104AYSI,"Credit goes to Jerry Stiller for keeping this from being a total bore.  Well, Jerry Stiller and a few snickers at Carlos Mencia as well.

I should have started by saying that I hope the magazine whose name starts with an Ma and ends with xim canned the reviewer whose comments were clipped to put on the box.  ""It's Ben Stiller's funniest movie.""  What planet does that reviewer live on?!  Funniest movie?  Most definitely not.

This movie is proof that you can take most of the team that brought us Something about Mary and realize that Cameron Diaz must be a comic genius because without her you just don't get the desired effect.  Malin Akerman seems to be trying to channel Diaz but just can't pull it off.  Perhaps it's because in this movie, for the most part, it's the female lead that is serving as the brunt of the jokes where in Mary it was Stiller who kept having stupid things happen to him.  Eventually that happens in this movie too, but by the time it does happen you've probably given up on the idea that the movie will ever really be funny.

Part 40-year old virgin wannabe, part Something About Mary wannabe, and very few parts funny.  That is what is left at the end of this film.

I rated this at 2 stars.  It might rise to the level of 2.5 stars, but barely.  It is most definitely not the Farrelly brother's best work, nor is it the best from any of the others in the cast (except for perhaps the elder Stiller, but that likely isn't true either...)  Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language.  114 minutes of running time you should spend on other, better, films.  If you really loved Something about Mary you might enjoy this one, but know going in that it's not the best.",1209859200,,1709,4.388535031847134

3045767,3,B00104AYSI,"Ben Stiller steps in with the Farrelly brothers one more time in ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  It's the story of Eddie (Stiller), an unmarried and seemingly unlucky in love man who's just attended his ex-girlfriend's wedding.  He's humiliated at the wedding by being placed at the ""singles"" table (kid's table) and made fun of indirectly during the toasts at the reception.  A few days later he has a run-in with a purse snatcher and meets Lila (Malin Akerman).  The two eventually become a couple.  After much coaching from his father (real life dad, Jerry Stiller) and his best friend and a very brief courtship, Eddie takes the plunge and marries Lila. Everything is perfect until Eddie meets Lila's mom who, genetically speaking, doesn't give him much to look forward to.  Things go from bad to worse while driving down to Cabo for their honeymoon.  It gets even worse as the honeymoon unfurls.  Eventually, Eddie runs into and falls in love with Miranda (Michelle Monaghan).  She's the perfect woman for him and nothing like the complete stranger he's married to.  From here, the viewer is spoonfed tired Farrelly gag after tired Farrelly gag.  Eddie gets into all sorts of situations (some funny, most not) trying to hide his new love from his wife and vice versa.

The film drags quite a bit, especially when Akerman and Stiller are interacting.  Sure, there are some funny sex scenes but there's nothing new to them as far as humor goes.  The funniest scenes involve Miranda's Mississippi family.  From Martin to ""Byoo,"" they keep this film afloat.

Stiller's character isn't that likeable of a guy.  Akerman is cute, but I felt as if I was watching a Farrelly brothers' knock-off of Cameron Diaz.  Monaghan is excellent in this film and is the only character that I became remotely interested in.  Carlos Mencia plays uncle Tito, one of the worst gag characters in Farrelly history.

If you're used to the trashy (and when executed perfectly, funny) humor of the Farrelly brothers, you'll probably get some pleasure from ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  It's not their greatest film, but it does provide a few laughs.  It isn't as terrible as a lot of reviewers have stated here, but it is too much of a mish-mash to recommend it as a purchase.

3045787,4,B00104AYSI,"The films made by the Farrelly Brothers up to the point before this film had all been able to maintain a level of heart not seen before, or after in films containing some gross-out comedy. It's this blend of heart and knowledge of when to go for the kill that make them undeniably entertaining and they've made some great comedies with Mary and Dumb and Dumber being the bes, but all of their films up to this point has been immensely watchable.  With this film I think it may change for a lot people.  The heart of the brothers' is still in here but it's tonally different from anything they've released before. I think part of the reason is because they've approached this one from a previously existing framework and concept as opposed to an original idea based on genre (as all of their films are, which makes them so accessible on the surface). This film is funny and charming and contains heart, but part of the problem that a lot of people will have with the film is that when watching it you will be remembering the other films and no film makes you think of their other films like this one. The main reason for this, I think, is in the casting. Ben Stiller was the star of their most popular film his co star for a majority of the film is an actress who's unbelievably similar in numerous ways to Cameron Diaz who also starred in Mary. This film suffers by comparison because the aims of this movie are more sophisticated.  In their other films they had protagonists and other characters who did bad things and somehow you laughed at it because they were like harmless children who didn't know any better. Stiller's character in this film is different in that the Brother's attempt to make us feel for him as a mature adult while also recognizing that he does equally deplorable things, that may not seem deplorable at first, but end up being that way.  The end leaves you with a feeling that I'm not sure anyone would be prepared for knowing they were watching a film of the Farrelly's. This all results in a great juxtaposition of humor and light horror since the humor in this feels extremely dark, but really isn't. Watching it makes me long to see more of Malin Akerman, but I wonder if she'll last longer enough to get a distinctive role and hold onto it. We'll see. As for unfunny, the king of unfunny is in this movie and is the only reason I'm giving this a 4 star rating. Carlos Mencia has got to be the dryest no-talent comedian out there. Everything he does feels like a knee jerk reaction to what's going on in the world and what's worse, he never has a full comic persona so he halfs his performance in everything he does, this movie included.

3045810,1,B00104AYSI,"""Heartbreak Kid"" is a travesty of moviemaking. The only redeeming quality is the setting: the scenery is gorgeous, whether or not actually filmed in Cabo, Mexico.

The premise: A forty-year-old, never-married man, Eddy is the epitome of the male unable to commit for fear of finding the right woman just around the corner. That remains the premise to the last credit, regardless of so-called plot. Ben Stiller has done better, even though he too frequently plays the loser or near-loser with aplomb. He is definitely a loser in this film even though that is not how he plays it this time. And what is with his appearance? He has aged twenty years since ""Night at the Museum,"" at least a movie in which his losing character eventually wins. In this loser movie though, Stiller appears to have pumped up a few muscles for his sex scenes, but his extreme thinness makes him look awful

As for Jerry Stiller, who, haha, plays his father, he is such a caricature of himself. From his ""Seinfeld"" days to this role, the elder Stiller looks so cartoonish with his dyed hair and strange fashions. And the outrageous vulgarities he has to speak! Is he for real? The lovely Malin Ackerman is fixed in my memory now as this horrible she-witch. At least, she can act. Ditto for Michelle Monagham, the next heart to break.

If Uncle Tito is supposed to add humor, someone is seriously lacking in what passes for humor. He was not funny. Crude, cruel, and misguided. He is no Rob Schneider. Farrelly Brothers, I hold you responsible for this character disaster.

The ending? Is it better? My question is: Who would fall for this person in the first place? The movie's title implies fun to me. Heartbreak Kid. Whop-de-do! Break hearts! What fun!

3045811,3,B00104AYSI,"I'm writing this because too many reviewers are going crazy like The Heartbreak Kid was the worst movie ever made or something which is just ridiculous. Regarding 2007's comedies, Superbad and Knocked Up were both grossly overrated. They had about 20 minutes of funny parts each. It seemed like the producers just rushed them out the door without bothering to give them a couple of much needed rewrites and still the world has gone crazy over them. Personally, I laughed more consistently while watching The Heartbreak Kid. For my money, The 40 Year Old Virgin is the best comedy to have come out in the past three or four years as it is filled with laughs and has no long dry spells like Knocked Up, Superbad, and even The Heartbreak Kid to a lesser degree.

Does THK blaze new trails? No. Is it going to win Oscars or become a timeless classic? No. That said, it's got a lot of laughs and is definitely worth renting. I suspect it just became trendy to rag on it and now everybody's piling on. The same thing happened with The Cable Guy which is a great film, IMO. The Farrelly Brothers movies aren't all equal but they all have funny parts. If you liked Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me Myself and Irene, and Shallow Hal you should get a kick out of this one too, though you might not watch it repeatedly. If the other Farrelly Brothers movies gross you out or offend you with their utter disregard for political correctness, then steer clear. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can deny that the scenes were Lila shows her true colors as a sexually insatiable, tasteless halfwit with baggage galore are laugh out loud funny. Stiller's immigration troubles are great as well. Jerry Stiller wasn't given enough good lines to maximize his potential, which is unfortunate but certainly not a deal-breaker regarding the whole ""to see or not to see"" question. Also, I didn't find either of the leading ladies particularly fetching, though I did appreciate the cool, girl next door quailty of Miranda.

While I did not expect the typical romantic-comedy for which Stiller is known (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Along-Came-Polly/dp/B00005JMW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Along Came Polly</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeping-the-Faith/dp/B00003CXHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeping the Faith</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-the-Parents/dp/B00003CXO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet the Parents</a>&nbsp;etc...), I did expect a role worthy of his immense talent (I mean this is the guy who did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Permanent-Midnight/dp/6305260621/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Permanent Midnight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zero-Effect/dp/0780623223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zero Effect</a>, The Cable Guy , AND Mystery Men ... he can be silly, cutting-edge, and intense!!).  His skills as an actor were entirely wasted here (any actor can play a desperate bachelor experiencing a mid-life crisis ... YAWNNNN!). Ditto for Jerry Stiller (that all of his jokes hinged on some manner of vulgarity is sooooo pedestrian!!)

This film has not a speck of playfulness (which is why most people enjoy the Farrelly Brothers). And, I assure you, I will think twice before investing in another of their works. They have forgotten their audience and reek of desperation. (Guys, you do not have to keep up with the new directors, just do your own thing!!)

In sum: I'm not advising you against watching it, I'm just suggesting that you rent it before you buy it. As far as this film is concerned, it is literally one of the worst directed (no need to delve into it here), worst (re)written (see for yourself), disasters of the year.",1201910400,17,3500,8.05699481865285

I would rather spend 2 hours getting paper cuts on the most sensitive parts of my body than to watch this movie again.  The plot is non-existent.  The weak attempt at humor is tasteless and just awful.  The acting is like a home movie that people forgot to turn the camera off and recorded two hours of nothing.  I am astounded at how bad this movie was.  I mean it wasn't even cult classic bad.  It made Army of Darkness seem like a modern art masterpiece.

3045819,3,B00104AYSI,"Situational comedy is something that Ben Stiller knows and knows how to do well. There's something About Mary and Meet the Parents are perfect examples of the kind of ""next door guy"" character he is known for. The Heartbreak Kid is yet another film about a guy who cannot find true love, but meets Miss Right who is not that ""right"" after all. Stiller is charming, the situational jokes are entertaining for the most part--perhaps raunchier that the movies I mentioned above--but the film looses momentum in the second act due to some flat soapy situations. despite its flaws; The Heartbreak Kid gets a passing grade even though the title of the film doesn't really go with our protagonist.

Brief Intro Story:
40-year old San Francisco bachelor Eddie Cantrow (Ben Stiller) is down and out because his former fiance is getting married--apparently he is afraid of commitment. To make things worse, he gets invited to her wedding only to get humiliated some more by his ex and her father--maybe he got invited for that very reason. On his way home, he sees a guy stealing a girl's purse. He tries to stop him, but he thief sprays some perfume on his eyes and gets away with her purse. Lila (Malin Akerman) thanks him for the effort and a romantic relationship begins. After some pressure from his eccentric father Doc (Jerry Stiller [Ben's real father]) and best friend to marry this woman, he finally does and they go to their honeymoon in Mexico.

While they are staying in the hotel, he finds out serious personality issues and ugly truths about Lila. He now thinks that he rushed to get married and made a huge mistake. In all of this confusion, he meets the beautiful Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) and they clicked instantly. What would happen to Lila? Will he tell her that he just got married?

Review:
Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly (Shallow Hal, There's Something About Mary) are veterans in the genre of situational romantic comedies. Most of them are pretty good so if you liked their early movies, you might like this one. They are not over the top with profanity and vulgarity like recent comedies as Knocked Up or Superbad. They do, however, add some unnecessary nudity with hit-or-miss sex jokes, but overall, they mostly work.

The first act of the film is brilliant. We get to know Eddie's personality. He is an easy going, charming, and down to earth next-door guy. Sometimes he could be insecure and involved in misunderstandings--think of Gaylord Focker from Meet the Parents--but unlike Focker, this time he is afraid of serious relationships. As I said earlier, he can do this kind of character with half of his brain. But the problems begin in the second act (in their honeymoon when he meets Miranda). The film drags now with soapy dilemmas like: Do I go out with this girl but I just got married? Should I tell her about my wife? These are burning question that Eddie asks himself, but this situation goes on for way too long with the jokes becoming scarce and more annoying characters in the horizon--the editing could have been much better here, perhaps they should have focused more on Eddie and Lila. In the end, the fun picks up a little bit, but the charisma of the protagonist seems to fade away.

The Verdict:
Not as funny as Meet the Parents and way raunchier than There's Something About Mary, The Heartbreak Kid probably won't disappoint Stiller's fans. He delivers the jokes the way he knows how, but the Soap-TV draggy moments and those hit-or-miss jokes take away some of the fun.",1200268800,,3519,4.743464052287582

This movie started off kind of dumb and boring and I was like, ""uh oh....another waste"".  Finally the story got interesting when he met the psycho girlfriend.  I was totally impressed with her performance (Mila Akerman?). She reminds me of Cameron Diaz. But if Cameron Diaz played the part of the girlfriend, I know I wouldn't have liked this movie, she's too over the top and self-aware and a crap actress.  What I loved about this movie is the unraveling of how much of a loser she turns out to be. I enjoyed watching Ben Stiller have to deal with her and slowly start to realize what he had got himself into.  I was like, ""ha ha, you ended up with a looneybird"".  If you have issues with men, you actually get enjoyment out of seeing him all dissapointed and screwed over.  There are some dull moments, it's not a perfect comedy, but overall, ""Hearbreak Kid"" had me laughing out loud in the genuine giddy way near tears.  It's extremely rare for me to laugh, I'm sort of jaded like everybody these days.  I think Ben Stiller is fantastic, and I loved Mila's performance,  she made the movie for me.

I tend to judge a comedy by the amount of laughs I get out of it and I had several ""lol"" moments in this movie. Sure, some of the humor is crude and some of it is done in bad taste, but that is to be expected in a Farrelly brothers movie. I thought the way that Stiller's character finds out all the bad and surprising history of his new bride was very entertaining. It's worth at least a rent if you like the Farrelly brothers movies or are a fan of Ben Stiller.",1199232000,8,706,4.086330935251799
3045838,2,B00104AYSI,"I'm a longtime fan of Ben Stiller's, but this movie left a bad taste in my mouth. What could have been a funny exploration of why some men fail to commit and why chemistry works with some and not others is totally lost in a mishmash of self-congratulatory, immature frat-boy humor (in the worst sense; I loved the frat-boy humor in Something About Mary and Knocked Up). I like Stiller best when he's paired with either a script or a lead actress with some heart, like in Meet the Parents, but in this movie the two actresses serve little function other than stereotypes on extreme ends of a testosterone-driven spectrum. For this movie to work, the wife must be truly awful on a grand scale, but I found myself feeling sorry for her and disliking Stiller's character more and more as the movie went on. The wife won't go deep-sea fishing. Horrors! She burns too easily! She thinks his nickname ""Ed"" is short for Edmund instead of Edward! That's grounds for divorce right there!

What can a man do? Only run to the arms of the dark haired salt-of-the-earth Mississippi girl who shoots tequila with gusto and laughs at his jokes. Monaghan is likeable but hardly transcends above the ideal good sport girl next door; there is no real personality that would set her so far above anyone else, that I could see.
Never explained is Ed and Lila spent 6 weeks together prior to nuptials and never discussed her job, their debts, their musical tastes, etc. Maybe there is a lesson to be learned there, but it isn't worth the two hours of life wasted on watching this movie.",1199232000,2,1563,4.582142857142857

First, I simply do not like Ben Stiller and second, I saw the original, loved it and feared being disappointed. I have to say, I was impressed. The charactor played by Michelle Monaghan was so delightfully inspiring and just down right adorable, any man that has a beating heart would have to fall in love with her. It is definately not a polically correct movie in any shape or form, nor was it intended to be. Maybe that's the reason so many are trashing it. But my personal philosophy is and always has been that, ""Polical Correctness"", is nothing more than tyranny against freedom of speech, stealthfully misplaced in mannerisms. Could the movie have been better? Sure, they probably could have cut about 12 mins. out of the beginning and removed some of the slapstick. But the acting was some of the best you will see in a comedy and for the most part it was pretty darn funny! So rent it and see for yourself. Just remember it was not made for children.

Moreover, the film shows a particularly cruel streak toward the two women involved in the shenanigans. The bloom may finally be off the hair goo.

The plot starts out promisingly in a particularly picturesque San Francisco (thanks to Matthew Leonetti's crisp cinematography) as Eddie Cantrow, the lonely owner of a San Francisco sporting-goods store, has a history of averting commitment in his long-term relationships. Turning forty and watching his last girlfriend of five years get married from the desperate kiddie table, he decides to throw caution to the wind when he meets Lila, a seemingly sweet blonde beauty, in a meet-cute situation involving a mugger. They get married after only six weeks of dating, but the marriage starts to unravel on the car trip down to their honeymoon destination, Los Cabos. One bad revelation after revelation comes out, and she evolves into a nightmarish freak with a free-flowing deviated septum. In a twist of fate, she suffers from severe sunburn and is stuck in the hotel room recovering. Enter Miranda, a good-humored girl-next-door from Mississippi in Los Cabos with her extended family. Naturally, Eddie and Miranda hit it off, and you can guess the rest.

Ben Stiller plays Eddie in familiar manic mode, though his character degenerates through the course of the story from likeable schlub to obsessive jerk. Some of the turns he takes are hilarious, like the out-of-kilter segment where he illegally crosses the border back from Mexico, but for the most part, he just feels like a sketch of a person. Malin Akerman deserves a medal for subjecting herself to a series of humiliations that turn her into an imbecilic harridan, while Michelle Monaghan provides a unique version of the ""dream girl"" as Miranda. It was a creative move to have a blonde bombshell like Akerman play the one Eddie tries to jettison, but the problem is that both she and Monaghan come across more as victims of their characters' stupidity than Eddie's machinations. By the end of this overlong movie, I became indifferent to anyone's fate as the story spits and sputters in the final stretch. As the final credits roll, there are two random scenes included that extend on the characters, but they aren't worth the wait.

The speedy end-of-2007 DVD release, less than three months after the original release, reflects its lackluster box office performance. Even so, there are a robust number of extras to be found. First off is Peter and Bobby Farrelly's informative commentary track which shows how seriously they took the venture despite the result. There is a decent 16-minute making-of featurette, ""The Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition"", which was taped mostly on the set. Three shorts are more disposable - a sentimental interview with the father and son Stillers (Jerry plays Ben's irascible father), an irreverent look at an egg toss contest conducted during the production, and a quick video of the cast Halloween party. Six deleted scenes, a gag reel, and the original theatrical trailer round out the extras.",1199059200,2,4468,5.665671641791045

He marries a girl that he barely knows, realizes that she's not the person he thought she was (she's very disturbed, in a Farrelly Brothers sort of way) , meets a normal (and I might add very hot) girl while on his honeymoon, and falls in love with her.

An afront to thinking men, women and children this venture finds no value in Mexican culture nor the animal world (in a graphic scene of bestiality).

But then Lila (Malin Akerman, channeling Cameron Diaz) turns out to be the HellBride of Doom, and Stiller winds up trapped in Cabo with a woman he can't get away from.

About now is when the movie makes a sudden turn off a cliff, in my mind. Instead of keeping Stiller's Eddie as a lovable schmoe who has to wrestle the situation with smarts and heart, he turns into an absolute heel. He meets a Mississippi lady on vacation with her family, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and before you can say ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">40-Year-Old Virgin</a>,"" Stiller is aping every bad man-sex cliche he can.

Expect to struggle, along with Elaine May and Neil Simon (no doubt), to forgive this 2007 comedic transgression because we--and their legacies-- deserve better.  These two comedic titans conspired to bring us the original movie The Heartbreak Kid (1972)--May directed and Simon wrote the screenplay, after adapting Bruce Jay Friedman's short story. That movie, with adept co-stars Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, amusingly captures irrepressible Jewish male angst and falling in impractical love. The current version drops into the prickly directorial hands of the Farrelly brothers (Fever Pitch)--once again reinforcing the notion that comedy necessitates flair, not impudence.

Ben Stiller (Night at the Museum) is Eddie Cantrow, a 40-year-old bachelor who owns a sporting goods store. Following the wedding of his ex-fianc of five years, he gets vulgar counsel about getting on with life and women, from both his 77-year-old dad (Jerry Stiller, Ben's father in real life) and browbeaten married friend Mac (Rob Corddry, Blades of Glory). With God (or the devil?) smiling upon him, Eddie meets Lila (Malin Akerman, The Brothers Solomon) when he intervenes as her purse is snatched (on Valentine 's Day-- contrived? you bet). Within weeks the two get married and honeymoon at a Mexico resort. There, Eddie rapidly realizes--thanks to Lila's irritating singing with the car radio, butchering of English (""Inhabitate is not a word""), preference for masochist sex, revealed unemployment, etc.--that he may have jumped a tad too quickly into marriage. Following a catastrophic sunburn, Lila stays hidden in their hotel suite. This leaves Eddie time to court the beautiful, and sports loving, vacationing Miranda (Michelle Monaghan, Mission: Impossible III). Eddie gets more than he bargained for, though, when he realizes he is falling into and out of love--all while still honeymooning.

Making his second Farrelly brothers turn (There's Something About Mary, 1998), Ben Stiller perpetuates his Everyman persona by appearing to be a bumbling yet reasonable guy--who, as events unfold, proves as morally bankrupt as everyone else in his life. With this, their 9th  directorial effort, I have come to expect coarse humor wrapped in the Farrelly brothers' unconventional (and now mechanical) boy gets-loses-gets girl package. In The Heartbreak Kid, the brothers cast an intensified spotlight on sophomoric behavior--love hurts, they reiterate and so does comedy when bungled with such fruitless ribaldry.

R for strong sexual content, crude humor and language.

It should not come as a big surprise that Farrellys focus most of their attention on the humiliation and gross-out antics, but their techniques seem more contrived and their set-ups more scripted this time around, especially when Judd Apatow has done a better job humanizing such hi-jinks in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>. Moreover, the film shows a particularly cruel streak toward the two women involved in the shenanigans. The bloom may finally be off the hair goo.

The plot starts out promisingly in a particularly picturesque San Francisco (thanks to Matthew Leonetti's crisp cinematography) as Eddie Cantrow, the lonely owner of a San Francisco sporting-goods store, has a history of averting commitment in his long-term relationships. Turning forty and watching his last girlfriend of five years get married from the desperate kiddie table, he decides to throw caution to the wind when he meets Lila, a seemingly sweet blonde beauty, in a meet-cute situation involving a mugger. They get married after only six weeks of dating, but the marriage starts to unravel on the car trip down to their honeymoon destination, Los Cabos. One bad revelation after revelation comes out, and she evolves into a nightmarish freak with a free-flowing deviated septum. In a twist of fate, she suffers from severe sunburn and is stuck in the hotel room recovering. Enter Miranda, a good-humored girl-next-door from Mississippi in Los Cabos with her extended family. Naturally, Eddie and Miranda hit it off, and you can guess the rest.

Ben Stiller plays Eddie in familiar manic mode, though his character degenerates through the course of the story from likeable schlub to obsessive jerk. Some of the turns he takes are hilarious, like the out-of-kilter segment where he illegally crosses the border back from Mexico, but for the most part, he just feels like a sketch of a person. Malin Akerman deserves a medal for subjecting herself to a series of humiliations that turn her into an imbecilic harridan, while Michelle Monaghan provides a unique version of the ""dream girl"" as Miranda. It was a creative move to have a blonde bombshell like Akerman play the one Eddie tries to jettison, but the problem is that both she and Monaghan come across more as victims of their characters' stupidity than Eddie's machinations. By the end of this overlong movie, I became indifferent to anyone's fate as the story spits and sputters in the final stretch. As the final credits roll, there are two random scenes included that extend on the characters, but they aren't worth the wait.",1192579200,4,3661,5.7652495378927915
3279826,3,B00104AYSI,"The jokes in the latest Farrelly Brothers comedy are fast and furious. It's just too bad they couldn't find a heart to hang them from. ""The Heartbreak Kid"" starts off promisingly enough, when Ben Stiller seems to finally find the girl he may actually be a match with. But then Lila (Malin Akerman, channeling Cameron Diaz) turns out to be the HellBride of Doom, and Stiller winds up trapped in Cabo with a woman he can't get away from.

About now is when the movie makes a sudden turn off a cliff, in my mind. Instead of keeping Stiller's Eddie as a lovable schmo who has to wrestle the situation with smarts and heart, he turns into an absolute heel. He meets the Mississippi lady on vacation with her family Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and before you can say ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" Stiller is aping every bad man-sex cliche he can. Miranda's family are played as one-dimensional buffoons for most of the movie, and the piling on of the gross-out jokes reaches a climactic peak of awful when a very large chunk of carpet with a piercing shows up. At that point, I just groaned and wondered what had happened to the two guys who made the classic ""There's Something About Mary"" and the sweetly funny ""Fever Pitch."" Because ""The Heartbreak Kid"" is both misogynistic and misanthropic, loading up the stupid human tricks till you wonder if the idea was to make a movie so heartless that you could better understand why ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" are so brilliantly funny.

That's not to say there aren't some funny spots. The sex scenes are screamingly hilarious the first few times before wearing thin. Jerry Stiller plays Eddie's dad as an over-sexed lout and gets the film's best lines. Rob Corddry jumps away from his Daily Show life to be a scene stealing p-ssy-whipped husband, and the Donkey Dance is a classic set piece. Even the overlong scenes of Eddie trying to get back into America were pretty funny, as they were some of the too few moments that took advantage of Stiller's good-natured comedic skills. Too bad it doesn't all add up to a coherent film. If you think I am being too harsh, go back and rent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Me-Myself-Irene/dp/B00003CXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Me, Myself & Irene</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-About-Mary/dp/B0006GANPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something About Mary</a>&nbsp;to remind yourself just how brilliant the Farralleys can be.",1192406400,,2518,5.30827067669173
3279827,3,B00104AYSI,"Ben Stiller is a 40 year old bachelor who doesn't see the point in settling down. But after he is forced to sit at the singles table with a few children at his ex's wedding, he decides to at least embrace the thoughts of a relationship.

He accidentally ""rescues"" a Marine Biologist who was doing laundry named Lila by attempting to fight off a purse snatcher who gets away. She tracks him down at a store he owns and they start to date. But after only 6 weeks of dating, she discovers she has to leave the country to follow her career. She is the only person that can do it, because she is the only one who is not married. Armed with all the Pro's(none of the con's)of marrying Lila from his married friend, his father (Ben Stiller's on screen and off screen father), and a couple of bratty twins at a wedding, he decides to exchange vows with Lila.

The road trip to their honeymoon in Mexico turns out to be a little more than he bargained for, because her singing goes from cute to hilariously annoying as she sing along to every single song on the radio, from every genre of music. The honeymoon is where Ben discovers she MAY not be the girl for him. Turns out there was a lot about her that he did not know, like her wild sexual habits, her deviated septum and how she got it, details of her past relationships, and her career goals. In the midst of it all, he meets a down to earth woman who he falls deeply for, but does not know how to tell his current wife that he wants to leave her, or the woman he fell in love with that he is on his honeymoon and exchanged vows less than a week ago.

I rated the movie a 3 out of 5 only because the character Ben Stiller was not very likeable. He married before knowing the person he was going to marry and was not hesitant to leave his wife for someone who he thought was better meaning he didn't take marriage seriously. Ben Stiller played a scripted character beautifully but me being a woman, it was character that I really didn't care for by the end of the movie, a character which we found did not seem to learn from his mistakes.

All in all, the movie was very enjoyable, but usually the main character is someone who we could relate to, sympathize with, and fall in love with by the end of the movie. But by the end of this movie, I really wanted to slap Ben Stiller's character in the face with a jellyfish and watch him squirm and then call Lila to ""soothe"" it like she did when he stumbled upon our tentacled friend.....",1192406400,,2481,4.205882352941177
3279828,4,B00104AYSI,"Eddie (Ben Stiller) is a bachelor approaching 40 who, following his ex-girlfriend's wedding, is feeling increasing pressure to get married. He meets and begins dating a woman named Lila (Malin Akerman). But she says work will force her to move to Rotterdam if they don't get married right away. Eddie takes the bait and jumps into a quickie marriage with a woman he hardly knows. But Eddie soon realizes he has married the wife from hell. While on their honeymoon to Cabo, Eddie meets Miranda (Michelle Monaguay). Eddie has much more in common with this fun, intelligent and down to earth gal and the two fall madly in love. But Eddie never tells Miranda the truth about already being married and, following a big misunderstanding, she heads back home to Mississippi with her family. The film ends with a final strange plot twist that I won't give away.

The ""Heartbreak Kid"" is very loosely based on a 1972 comedy starring Charles Grodin and Cybil Shepard. But, of course, here the movie is given the classic Farrelly Brothers treatment, with lots of over the top gags and raunchy jokes. I did get enough laughs from the movie to make it worth seeing. But I don't think it is quite as original and funny as the the best Farrelly Brother's films, such as ""Something About Mary."" I most enjoyed the first half, the roadtrip and early honeymoon scenes are hilarious and Lila truly is a man's worst nightmare. The second half is OK and Miranda is certainly a likable character. But the story bogs down a bit and the laughs don't come at quite the same fast and furious pace.

Still this is a well made comedy and fans of the Farrelly Brothers extreme style of humor will want to see it.",1192233600,,1683,4.6066666666666665
3279829,3,B00104AYSI,"Now that he's single after losing his fiance (Ali Hallis), Eddie Cantrow is wandering aimlessly, unsure of what he wants in a companion. He makes it on the rebound when he meets a young lady named Lila (Malin Akerman). Six weeks into the relationship, Lila tells Eddie that she'll have to move away for two years as part of her job requirement. After being goaded by his dad (Jerry Stiller) and best friend (Rob Corddry), Eddie decides to marry Lila on the spot, and they take a honeymoon in Mexico. But it's at that point that Lila shows her true colors as a total annoyance. Eddie now regrets what he has done, and his troubles are about to rise when he meets the real woman for him, Mississippi high school teacher Miranda (Michelle Monaghan).

I'm sort of disappointed with Peter and Bobby Farrelly's return to raunchy comedy, The Heartbreak Kid. It's been seven years since they've explored this territory after Me, Myself & Irene ate up box office numbers in 2000. Since then, David Dobkin and Judd Apatow took over with their raunchy classics (I think we all know the movie titles, so I won't get into it). While The Heartbreak Kid aces Superbad in terms of narrative and laughs, I'm still at different ends whether or not to support this film or forget about it.

And I'm a Ben Stiller fan, as is everybody else. Reuniting with his partners in crime since The Heartbreak Kid, Stiller carries the film and balances his patented neurotic acts and comedic frustrations that have been missed for quite some time. He's even complimented by a strong cast, which includes Michelle Monaghan, finally free of Tom Cruise's clutches post-Mission: Impossible III, Malin Akerman (don't be surprised if she takes some roles away from Anna Faris; this is a true breaktrhough performance as Isla Fisher's in Wedding Crashers), Rob Corddry (who finally makes a solid debut after some disappointing co-starring roles), Jerry Stiller (at his best, as always), and even Carlos Mencia (a wickedly underrated comedian who is funnier than George Lopez).

But the Farrellys jumped the ball with Danny R. McBride. Fresh off the semi-success of Hot Rod, it seems like McBride has taken Dan Fogler's crappy comedy agenda and just be irritating as possible. He plays the overprotective cousin character with a whole lot of indication. While it's not a method-abusing performance, McBride eventually wears thin on the viewer trying too hard to be funny, but coming off like a jerk-off. Even the scene where she shoves a chili pepper up Ben Stiller's nose had the chance to be a laugh-riot, but his overbearing presence kills that chance.

Another problem is that the film is quite long. Much like Superbad, The Heartbreak Kid starts off as a traditional comedy with every trademark comedy bit from the director. As I stated, Ackerman's willingness to have fun (and get naked as well) is the most endearing part of the film, and the raucous sex scenes are fall-down hilarious. And then there's the scene with a donkey dry-humping a woman that will be chalked up as another Farrelly brother highlight.

But once the film gets to the point where nothing can go wrong, it does. Most of the film is a light-as-a-feather sex farce, yet as the film gets close to the end, the Farrely brothers start to lose steam as they struggle for a conclusion that becomes disheartening. While it does make room for some good laughs (including one where Eddie joins a group of illegal aliens to get back to America, and growing lots of facial hair in the process), there are long chasms of scenes that make little or no sense (most including McBride), and the ending, while realistic, sort of left me in the cold. I won't tell you what happens, but there's an appearance from an overexposed celebrity who is shoved in my face (and the public's I'm sure).

Maybe it's the fact that Judd Apatow is now taking over where they left off. But the Farrelly bros. dropped the ball with this film. Oh, yes, there are laughs, but it ain't the laugh riot that they've been known for. Better luck next time, I guess?",1192147200,,4063,4.756028368794326

3279996,5,B00104AYSI,"One the finest films Ben Stiller has done...!  Not so much a comedy, as it presents rather droll, unusual, and adult, entertainment.  This is a redoing of a film of the same name from 1972, which featured Elaine May as Director, and perhaps to a degree, writer.  The modern film [2007] by the Farrelly brothers, is not as serious and dead pan, but it is a decided improvement being due to the fact that it is broadly speaking lighter fare, and offering larger scope.  The Farrelly's attempt to be more illustrative of the man's side, while nonetheless retaining the whimsical comedy and basic dignity that was so characteristic of the Elaine May and Mike Nichols movies of the 60s/70s, and which made them in a manner so charming and notable.  A refinement of the original vision, therefore, and highly recommended.",1449792000,,815,4.792857142857143

3280044,2,B00104AYSI,"The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, make comedies.  Some of them, like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" are funny.  Some of them, like ""Kingpin"" and ""Fever Pitch,"" are only so-so; and others, like ""Osmosis Jones"" and ""Shallow Hal,"" are outright duds.  Count 2007's ""The Heartbreak Kid"" among the duds.  Well, at least the movie is a dud; the video quality of this Blu-ray edition is outstanding.  Small compensation.

The Farrellys have always had a playful mean streak in them, and they have often worked physical or mental disabilities into their films:  stupid people, obese people, mentally challenged people, one-handed people, sick people.  But in their adaptation of the 1972 Neil Simon-Elaine May movie of the same title, they seem just plain malicious.

Let me give you the setup first.  Ben Stiller plays a forty-year-old confirmed bachelor, Eddie Cantrow.  He owns a sporting goods store in San Francisco, and he seems content.  However, no one around him is content about his being unattached, including his father (played by Ben Stiller's real-life father, Jerry Stiller).  When Eddie goes to his ex-fiancee's wedding, practically everybody there ridicules him for still being single.

Then he meets a pretty blonde, Lila (Malin Akerman), who sweeps him off his feet.  After a whirlwind courtship, he marries her, and on their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas, the trouble starts.  Eddie realizes too late that he doesn't really know her.  Among other things, she talks and sings constantly, she won't shut up, she's a lot more aggressive than he realized, and she has any number of distasteful secrets that he just now finds out.  She is, in fact, pretty obnoxious, and he begins to have his doubts about having married her.

That's when he meets Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a young woman visiting Cabo with her family, and he falls in love with her.  So, that's the premise:  What do you do when on your honeymoon you realize you've made a huge mistake in marrying the wrong person and simultaneously find the real girl of your dreams?

What seemed humorous and daring thirty-odd years ago in Neil Simon's screenplay seems merely cruel in the Farrellys' rewritten account.  What we get here is a new wife who's an idiot and a new husband who's a cad, a liar, and an idiot.

The Farrellys' fill ""The Heartbreak Kid"" with crude language, crude jokes, and crude sex, little of which is even faintly amusing.  The gags are often of the slapstick variety, especially the ones that portray Lila as a klutz.  OK, I did find myself giggling briefly at one salacious scene where Eddie's dad is in a hot tub in Vegas with a woman of prodigious breast size.  But the rest of the film is almost painfully unfunny.

The misunderstandings that follow the film's setup are sometimes genuinely unbearable to watch, and the movie only gets worse as it goes along.  I found it largely gross, mean-spirited, frustrating, and ugly.

Final note:  When DreamWorks released ""The Heartbreak Kid"" to theaters, it carried an R rating for ""strong sexual content, crude humor and language.""  Here on Blu-ray, it continues with an R rating, yet we also find the following message preceding the movie:  ""This film has been modified from its original theatrical version.  It has been edited for content.""  Make of that what you will.

Video:
It's hard to find fault with the dual-layer BD50, 1080p, MPEG4/AVC transfer.  Indeed, it's so good it tends to reinforce my axiom that the worse the movie, the better the video quality.  The transfer retains the movie's 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio and the movie's robust colors.  Indeed, the colors are so bright and vivid, they fairly pop off the screen, which is perhaps a bit too much of a good thing because they are brighter and more vivid than real life.  I suppose the colors are appropriate, though, for a comedy that exaggerates life the way this one does.  Definition is good, skin tones are natural, clarity is exceptional, and black levels are deep.  Interior detailing is also good, and from a normal viewing distance the picture looks downright gorgeous.

Audio:
The English track's Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sounds fine, given that it has virtually nothing to do but reproduce dialogue and some fragments of forgettable background music.  It handles the job nicely, with overkill the order of the day.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc contains the usual assortment of extras, some of them even having to do with the movie.  The first thing up is an audio commentary by the film's directors, the Farrelly brothers.  They're surprisingly serious; somehow, I expected them to be joking through the whole commentary.  Next is a series of four featurettes.  The first is ""The Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition,"" about sixteen minutes long, providing a little history of the brothers in filmmaking.  Second is ""Ben & Jerry,"" five minutes about the Stillers, father and son, working together.  Third is ""Heartbreak Halloween,"" three minutes about a Halloween party the cast and crew had on the set.  And fourth is ""The Egg Toss,"" eight minutes about the egg tosses on the set.  Then there's a gag reel, four minutes, and six deleted scenes, about seven-and-a-half minutes.  All of these items are in standard definition.

Things conclude with sixteen scene selections and bookmarks; a high-def theatrical trailer; a guide to elapsed time; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
If this new Farrelly brothers version of Neil Simon's ""The Heartbreak Kid"" does anything good, it may be to send viewers out looking for the original 1972 movie.  That one wasn't the height of comedic genius, but at least it wasn't as joyless as this depressingly downbeat remake.",1433548800,,5829,5.007284079084287

3280121,5,B00104AYSI,"In a few scenes, I was laughing so hard, I was heaving for air (e.g., kitty ring).  Some other reviewers dogged this movie, mentioning the likes of Neil Simon and Cybil Sheppard.  Oh, my.  I don't know if its high-horse-itude or being Poindexters, or just having a really grown up approach to comedies, but this is > not < a smart comedy. In fact, its a really, really ""stupid comedy"" -- but big time funny if you're into similar movies.  To help you decide, here is my opinionated preference guide:
Which is funnier:
1. Dumb and Dumber or any movie with Hugh Grant?
2. Anchorman or When Harry Met Sally?
I could go on, but my point is this: I gave this 5 stars in the context of comparing it to other comedies. I cant argue in a film class that this is a ""5 star film. Comparing it to the classics, it may even be forgettable.  But if you still call them movies (not films), and you like physical comedy or Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, etc, this is well worth the low price.",1403222400,,972,4.260869565217392

3280154,5,B00104AYSI,"If you are expecting a traditional romantic comedy, this is not it.  It is more like a spoof of a romantic comedy, with jokes that can get very vulgar.  So if those kinds of comedies are not something you find entertaining, then stay away from this one.

The plot is pretty simple.  A lifelong bachelor finally decides to get married, but only after knowing the bride for a few weeks.  On the way to, and during the honeymoon he discovers she is totally crazy.  Malin Ackerman totally plays up the crazy role, and runs with the totally over the top jokes.  The part of the movie that is the more traditional romantic comedy, is when Stiller's character meets a new love interest on his honeymoon, and tries to woo her, all while trying to keep her from learning about his wife.

This is definitely not a movie for kids or one for those who don't like the kind of humor.  There is a lot of swearing, nudity and sex jokes in it.  If you do like those kinds of movies, then it is worth checking out.",1365379200,,996,4.306451612903226

These characters are repulsive and the acting is too slow. The shock value of the Farrelly Brothers is just a cheap (and dirty) trick. So I feel like I should have known better, but nonetheless, this movie is completely degrading towards women, sex, and not actually a satiric depiction of dating, just gross.",1363219200,,474,4.654761904761905

I was surprised to see the black screen pop up at the beginning saying, ""this movie has been edited for content."" Hmm. They usually only do that on TV. It's just as well, because if that was the edited version, I'd hate to see the unedited version! Half the movies you see these days have unnecessary sex scenes in them, so this movie was not worse than MANY other movies. The language and the innuendo I would say went beyond funny bordering on gross. Some of it was funny, but most of it just makes you cringe.

The real problem comes when you cannot sympathize with the main character. His new wife did not have a complete personality change the instant they got married, like the previews implied. He was just a guy with no patience. So his wife likes to sing along to music in the car. Well, that's great. Most people would get bored and irritable and complain on a long car trip. Maybe he should be grateful!

I happen to love him and think this movie was hilarious.  There were some dull moments and maybe one or two that leave you shaking your head for a second, but seriously, what movie has your interest and is completely perfect 100% of the time?

There are lines from the movie (that I saw last well over a year ago) that I quote on a regular....the movie was just funny!

3280176,5,B00104AYSI,"Dont know why I love this movie so much.  Perhaps it's all of my trips to Cancun.  The movie can be quite raunchy and vulgar in some areas so you'll really never see a TV version that comes close to the original.  Note that some of the raunchy scenes are incredibly funny - all the more reason for owning the DVD.

The story line is witty and funny and the chemistry between all of the characters is very good.  Just don't watch with kids around as some sex scenes can be a little more than you'd expect from a Ben Stiller movie.  I don't buy many DVD's but this was a must own for me.

Special Note:

I think the rating is somewhat dumbed down on Amazon due to the fact that they offer an HD DVD version for very cheap.  HD DVD is NOT Blu-ray and wil become a coaster.

3280184,1,B00104AYSI,"Rarely do I hand out a one-star rating for a movie, because surely no movie can be THAT bad. But as I discovered with ""The Heartbreak Kid"", it is indeed possible. I literally hated this movie, and was repulsed beyond anything I'd seen before.

The movie opens normally enough, and even showed promise- with a cameo from actor Ben Stiller's real dad, Jerry, the movie could have followed Ben and his real dad into Las Vegas, and become a ""The Hangover""-esque film, for which I could have forgiven it. But the film derails as soon as it introduced the pretty, seemingly perfect Lila, whom Eddie (Ben Stiller) decides to marry on a whim. On their honeymoon, Lila becomes increasingly creepy and odd, causing Eddie to hate his snap decision to marry the woman he barely knew- especially when he meets someone else.

The whole film is a disaster. Crude to the point of cringing, blatantly cussing where it was hardly appopriate (the line, ""Let's go to a motel and f**k"" disgusted me), and downright embarrassing for stars like Ben Stiller and Michelle Monaghan to be attached to such a film, ""The Heartbreak Kid"" is one of the worst films you'll ever see.

Branching off quickly and wildly from the hasty marriage between Lila and Eddie to their honeymoon on a beautiful island, the films spins out of control, as if the directors got bored and rapidly began shooting ideas- which they all agreed to keep. The love-triangle between Eddie, Lila, and Michelle Monaghan's character, Miranda, is awkward and weird. The shocking crudeness was over the top, and leaves a bad taste that overshadows the attempts at humor.

The film feels like several writers were undecided on what kind of film to write. Some parts are clearly a romantic comedy, while others are severely crude and flat gross-outs. In the end, it branches off into an ending so bizarre and unsatisfying that I turned off the TV. The third act made no sense, and for the first time, I truly felt disgustingly cheated out of an hour and fourty minutes of my life.

""The Heartbreak Kid"" messes with the traditional romantic-movie formula, lacks heart, and tries vulgarity where it ruins the scenes. There's just no soul whatever to the film, and it feels pieced together imperfectly, trampling over you and leaving the viewer with a twisted, gross, unhappy feeling in their gut.

So the bottom line? The Farrelly Brothers have spawned several movies I've grown to hate, and this movie tops the list. I was throughly disappointed, because this movie could have been a lot funnier and sweeter if they had only cut out some of the scarring scenes. Buy it if you like, but when you turn off the TV, revolted, like I did: well, let's just say, I told you so.",1296259200,5,2706,4.7224576271186445
3280185,2,B00104AYSI,"I hate to start by saying `The Heartbreak Kid' is an extremely weak film and a huge disappointment. From the trailer this looks to be a typical funny Ben Stiller film, but you quickly realise that the best scenes are shown in the trailer and furthermore they are less funny when in the context of the film! There are unnecessarily crass moments in this film and rather than making you laugh, they make you double take and question how appropriate they are. There is also use of the `C' word which was completely out of place, out of keeping with the feel of the film and completely inappropriate. Generally I have no problem with crass jokes, or even use of the `C' word, but only in context and particular genres of film, these elements were out of step with what is marketed as a light hearted comedy. Sadly to say, after seeing Stiller in other funny films, this film has very little to offer and although it raises a chuckle in places it left me bored by the end and waiting for it's conclusion. Worth a look if you're a HUGE fan of Ben Stiller, otherwise you can give it a miss and not lose any sleep.

3280186,5,B00104AYSI,Its funny on TV but even funnier on DVD b/c no censorship.  The scenes w/nudity or graphic content contribute to the humor and serve to highlight the big differences between this mis-matched couple.,1289779200,,198,5.0
3280189,3,B00104AYSI,"A movie of this title starring Ben Stiller is bound to be hit, or at least worth its weight in laughs.  So when I saw this film, I was not disappointed, yet I found the visual aspects of a few over-the-top sex scenes rather raunchy and certainly not necessary for the humor this crazed plot and Stiller's comic appeal readily provided.

Tired of getting teased for his bachelorhood, Eddie Cantrow was quick to fall for the first pretty damsel in distress he befriended on a city street.  With the urging of Stiller's real-life and on-screen dad, this leading character marries who he believes to be the girl of his dreams. Two minutes into his honeymoon, he begins to have second thoughts that keep escalating until he realizes he's in his worst nightmare and not about to wake up anytime soon.

The only comforting part of this bad dream is the presence of Miranda, another woman on vacation with her family at the same resort where Eddie is honeymooning.  Afraid of losing Miranda and equally fearful of hurting his wife, it is easy for the viewer to sympathize with Stiller's character.  But Miranda's family is a frying pan waiting for Eddie to leap into after the fire.  Miranda herself proves to be not too stable, and Eddie has enough character flaws to deserve both women and plenty more.

While this movie was definitely funny, what I liked best was its unpredictable and open ending.  It was not the quick fix, or rescue scene, or typical ending I had in mind when I saw the previews.  For a few laughs, I would recommend this video - but put kids to bed first.",1285632000,,1571,4.578571428571428

3280191,2,B00104AYSI,"This film is not nearly as funny as it should be.  It was nowhere close to ""There's Something About Mary.""  Ben Stiller did a surprisingly good acting job in the film, but the film itself was not consistently laugh-out-loud, and I generally laugh at stupid, silly films that have the raunchy scenes that this film had.  What makes matters worse is that this film is based on the screenplay by Neil Simon.  Neil Simon plays are funny mainly because the lines are good.  This film seemed to lack the clever script and instead focused on sex and swearing, which can be funny in other films, but I think the fact that I saw and really enjoyed the original version of this film made me realize how less superior this one is.  In addition, for some reason, this DVD has been edited from the original version.  That seems absurd to me.  Yes, the DVD contains many Rated R scenes, but why the original version is not being sold is beyond me.  That in itself reduced my rating by one star.",1279756800,,980,4.430167597765363
3280192,4,B00104AYSI,"Talk about a movie that takes you, spins your head around in circles and dumps you all over the place the Heartbreak Kid breaks a lot of rules of film making and comedy and does it well.

It tells the story of a single guy Ben Stiller who is unable to find a woman, his sex obsessed father (played by his father Jerry) and his best pal Mac who are all looking to get him married off.

The movie starts to get you invested in his plight as he goes from embarrassment to embarrassment until he seems to come across the right girl, Lila.

In a mere 5 weeks pushed by his father and friend he marries her, and it is on the drive down to their honeymoon retreat to Mexico that things get interesting...

...that's where he meets the girl of his dreams, Miranda.

From here the plot twist and turns from disaster to disaster, in terms of the comedy the Farrellys set you up for every turn from Carlos Mencia through Miranda's family to the twins who after a brief introduction at the beginning of the film are used for great comic effect.  The reaction of his father and best friends to his martial problems made me instantly think of the famous Three Stooges short&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Collection-Volume-2/dp/B0006BECCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges Collection Volume 2</a>&nbsp;Husbands Beware.

The comedy becomes so odd and the situations so ridiculous (one scene with Jerry Stiller on the phone with his son from Vegas still gives me the shudders) that you don't know what to do.  The Farrellys slowly build up sympathy for Eddie as the film and then slowly bit by bit start to remove it until you wonder if you want him to get the girl of his dreams.

When you see the final scene (not counting the Easter egg with the Donkey)you realize who and what these characters are.  It is a very disarming experience.

Oh and don't do what I did, I watched it directly after seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trade/dp/B000YIGND6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trade</a>&nbsp;talk about getting your head and mind twisted all over the place.

This film is so not for kids it isn't funny, there are at least two sex scenes where I wonder how the actors involved managed to keep a straight face.  I couldn't do it.  Paradoxically it is, in many ways, a morality play, all the wrong and foolish decisions have all the consequences they should have, in at least one case tragic results.  So on second thought maybe you should make your teenage daughters watch it and Learn!

It is slapstick, it is deep comedy, it is sexual comedy, it is mind games, it is a morality play, it is cheep bawdy humor all rolled up into one brilliant package!

I don't know if it's a keeper but it should be seen at least once.

My wife turned this movie on while I was fielding some email, and I would peek up every now and then to see what she was watching.  My wife is a big ""romantic comedy"" and chick flick lover, so when I saw Ben Stiller, I zoned out thinking it was probably some crap like ""Along Came Polly"".  But then I saw that Stiller was playing the ""annoyed guy"" role and started watching more, then laughing, then launched IMDb and saw that it was a Farrelly Brothers film and started to get into it.  My wife went to bed halfway through it and I continued the movie in the bedroom and laughed my butt off!

Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Now just because it's a Farrelly Brothers movie, didn't guarantee that it would be a good or funny movie.  They've got some bombs in their catalog.  But ""Heartbreak Kid"" is definitely a 4 out of 5 stars.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say it's a 7.5.  Not great.  But entertaining as all hell!

I would suspect that people that got offended by this movie, are the types of people that get offended by films by Kevin Smith, Todd Philips, the Wayans and probably even Judd Apatow.  Those are the kind of people that I try to avoid in my daily life.  This movie definitely has some ""raunchy"" moments.

 It is R rated for a reason....in fact, I would say several very funny reasons. And Stiller, along with all the cast, proves that they have not only depth of character, but a sense of humor for electing to be in it.

Don't get me wrong, this movie does have several funny moments; I was literally rolling on the floor with one particular scene involving Carlos Mencia as the 'victim' of a vicious hand slap.  Yet the film doesn't work for a myriad of reasons, the most obvious one being Ben Stiller's character.  When the story begins, Stiller plays a commitment-evasive guy who finally takes the plunge and marries what he thinks is his 'dream girl.'  Trouble is, she's his Nightmare on Elm Street; so our protagonist feels compelled to lie, manipulate, connive, trick, thwart, deceive, and weave to get into the good graces of a new woman he's met. . .on his honeymoon.  Of course, the more he dodges and weaves, the more trouble he finds himself in--surely, by the end of the film, a golden lesson has been learned?

By the end, alas, Stiller's character is still a liar, manipulator, conniver, trickster, thwarter, deceiver, and dodge 'n weaver (this guy oughta run for office).  I discovered I didn't give two cents about him at the beginning of the film, and the character sure didn't appreciate in value by the end.  Heads up:  This is not your favorite aunt's 'There's Something About Mary'. . .there are some eye-popping scenes that are definitely not for the faint of heart.  Maybe that's why this turkey is called THE HEARTBREAK KID.  Might be on to something.

""Like a switch"" being turned, Lila begins to exhibit some very unusual behavior, including rough sex talk (and rough sex itself) and information about her life that startles Eddie (""I thought you worked?"") After Lila gets a nasty sunburn, Eddie heads out onto the beaches of Cabo and meets the girl of his dreams. Her name is Miranda (Michelle Monaghan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-Baby-Gone/dp/B0010ZR160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone Baby Gone</a>) and she's on vacation with her father, mother, cousins, and brothers. The two spark immediately and Eddie feels the need to get out of his new marriage and into something of more ...umm ...stability with Miranda.

Miscommunications and deceit are the nature with which Eddie finds himself lost in the quagmire of newlywedism and true love.

Bit parts move the film along, including a typical nasty role from Carlos Mencia as Tito, a perverted employee at the hotel where Eddie is staying; and Roy Jenkins as Buzz, Miranda's brother and protector who shoves a few things where they don't belong when he learns of Eddie's deception.

The film's most troubling aspect, though, is that it jumps around a lot and loses focus. From Carlos Mencia placing his ""thing"" in Lila's hand, to a very long section about Eddie trying to get back to America and having to go ""wet-back"" in order to do so, these diversions really hurt the main portions of the film.

But the surprise ending really helped the story tremendously. I won't give it away, but I will say that it surprised me greatly; I hadn't seen it coming but it was perfectly in line with what probably would've actually happened.

Just remember, though, it's still comedy-lite.

P.S. Did anyone else think of Cameron Diaz in the role of Miranda? Maybe it was just me...",1218067200,,3715,6.170212765957447

One of the biggest problems is Stiller's newlywed wife is so obnoxious, you grow tired of watching her and just want to throw her down the nearest elevator shaft! I realize this is the intended response to her, but there's a fine line to walk when you want an audience to stay interested.

The humor is pretty raunchy which doesn't bother me so much, but I was watching this one with my 80+ year old parents! lol!

3280259,2,B00104AYSI,"The Heartbreak Kid is a 2007 remake of a 1972 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/with-the-same-name/dp/6304836627/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">with the same name</a>.  Having never seen the original film but knowing that it is cited as pretty funny for its time, I fail to see how any of the lame cheap jokes in this remake that caught me with a few guilty impulsive chuckles could've received any reaction other than disgust in 1972, as it probably does even today.  Suffice to say, I think that means that as a remake this movie fails miserably, but I can't be sure.  So, I am judging The Heartbreak Kid strictly on its own merit, and this movie sucks.

The Farrelly brothers, who brought us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dumb-and-Dumber/dp/0780618556/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dumb and Dumber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-About-Mary/dp/B0006GANP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something About Mary</a>, put this mish-mash together using Ben Stiller as its main protagonist.  This also stars a disposable Michelle Monaghan and the completely unfunny Carlos Mencia.  Rob Corddy is funny in a few scenes as Stiller's best friend but Danny McBride and Jerry Stiller are not the least bit funny in roles where they are really trying hard to be. The only person who shouldn't feel at least moderately ashamed is Malin kerman, who manages to be exceptionally funny and overall pretty great in an awful production.  The story is basically about how Eddie (Stiller) marries Lila (kerman) and finds out after they marry that he made a huge mistake.  The Farrelly gross-out shenanigans ensue with a fraction of the charm that exists in their prior films.  Lila is disgusting in many ways and really, her scenes revealing these things are all that is funny about The Heartbreak Kid.  Soon, Eddie, on his Honeymoon no less, falls for another girl named Miranda (Monaghan) and we are supposed to care and root for him.

I don't blame Stiller as much as I'd like to.  I blame whoever thought the audience would want to identify with a pathetically weak and morally deficient jerk like Eddie.  On the other side of that coin, we are also expected to enjoy the demise of kerman's character and find humor in her pain.  Sure, she can be gross with her deviated septum and annoying for her taste in music, but people have flaws.  I actually kind of liked her, especially after her bedroom scenes, and I respected her even more after her heroics on the beach after Eddie was attacked by a jellyfish.  The contrast I'm sure the Farrelly brothers were looking for was her zany and shallow behavior combined with her model looks.  Everyone just hates a gal like that, don't they? That's all well and good but Stiller's Eddie is far more shallow and he is also incredibly dull.  Furthermore, Monaghan's Miranda is just as dull as Eddie.  It is very clear who the Farrellys want us to root for, but I was rooting for the doomed Lila all along.  Obviously, that could ruin anyone's viewing experience.

This is almost two-hours of watching Ben Stiller whine his way from scene to scene with very little to laugh at, and I guess we are all supposed to whine right along with him.  This is probably not worth a moment of your time, but kerman is definitely a talent to watch out for.",1211414400,3,3429,5.299445471349353
3280260,2,B00104AYSI,"When the lonely Eddie (Ben Stiller) meets the perky, young, blonde woman of his dreams, Lila (Malin Akerman), in Paramount's The Heartbreak Kid, the audience immediately expects something to be wrong with her because she seems to genuinely laugh at his bumbling, neurotic behavior.  Somehow, even after forty-plus years of chronic bachelor behavior, he is convinced she is the one for him--despite not really knowing anything about her-- and they marry.  Of course minutes after the fact, though, when they embark on a road trip on their honeymoon, he begins to see her in a new light and progressively regrets his decision--mostly do to the fact that he meets another woman, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and becomes convinced she is ""the one,"" despite not knowing her at all either.  Directed by the Farrelly brothers, The Heartbreak Kid is indecisive not only in the individual characters' decisions but on the whole in the tone of the film itself.  It rides the line between bittersweet comedy and painfully awkward profanity, all things Stiller and both Farrellys are known for taking on (and doing so successfully) in the past.  Unfortunately here, that tired, old formula is just plain painful.

When Lila's ""quirks,"" shall we say, first start coming to light, you can't help but wonder why Eddie isn't just blinded by the love he supposedly had for her only seconds before on-screen.  Instead, though, he is utterly annoyed and horrified, and completely writes her off, even though--while exaggerated--those little bits of character, such as singing along to every little thing on the radio, are ultimately harmless.  He even leaves her nursing a sunburn to drink and flirt with Miranda at the hotel bar; he is the epitome of the anti-hero, and he is completely dislikeable as a lead.  The Farrelly's The Heartbreak Kid is a poor attempt at remaking the 1970s version starring Charles Grodin and Cybil Shepard.  In fact, it is still unclear why one would need a new version of an unflashy, morally objective film in the first place.  There are no CGI additions, and the star power of Stiller alone is not nearly enough to save this less-than-mediocre attempt.

The Heartbreak Kid is full of tantrum-throwing caricatures, with the sole exception of Monaghan's Miranda, who is not really developed enough to form a knowledgeable opinion.  Therefore, the special features on the DVD must be relied upon to offer insight into the direction of said characters.  Unfortunately, though, all the audio commentary showcases is that the stereotypical portrayal, mostly on Stiller's part, was not so much direction as a lack thereof.  Nepotism runs rampant in Hollywood, but working with your friends time and again has become a worse syndrome, and the Farrellys prove that in the commentary, sharing stories how about how utterly fun it was to be in Stiller's presence on-set everyday.  They may have shared some laughs in rehearsals and at lunch, but that humor certainly didn't translate to the scenes as scripted.

The ""Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition"" is a talking-heads documentary in the directors' own words about how they got started in the film industry and worked their way up from indie comedies.  Of course there are also six deleted scenes and what the DVD calls a gag reel but is really more of a musical montage of the cast laughing and mumbling when they didn't seem to realize the camera was already rolling.  The few tidbits from Jerry Stiller actually elicit chuckling, though, and to expand on the humor he offers, ""Ben & Jerry"" is a five-minute featurette about what it was like for the two generations of Stillers to together for the umpteenth time but finally play father and son on-screen.

""Heartbreak Halloween"" is a quick but comical behind-the-scenes look at production on Halloween, when the entire crew came dressed in costumes.  ""The Egg Toss"" is another behind-the-scenes look at the cast and crew, this time featuring a weekly egg toss competition in the downtime on-set.  The addition of these two features on the DVD seems like yet another desperate attempt to show that the crew had fun making the movie... maybe so you should feel like you have to have fun while watching it?  If more features such as these are what the audience can expect as the Youtube generation gradually takes over, it would be greatly advised to salvage a few minutes of your life and just skip them.

To top off this oddly somber viewing experience, the DVD also features previews for some similar comedies, some of which have not yet been released (Drillbit Taylor), some that are also now available on DVD (Hot Rod), and one that is just a shameless plug for one of the film's stars other projects (Mind of Mencia: Season 3 Uncensored).  None of these sound particularly groundbreaking, and yet after The Heartbreak Kid, it has to be assumed that any one of them is funnier than the film featured on this disc.",1210982400,,4931,4.940677966101695

3280262,2,B00104AYSI,"Credit goes to Jerry Stiller for keeping this from being a total bore.  Well, Jerry Stiller and a few snickers at Carlos Mencia as well.

I should have started by saying that I hope the magazine whose name starts with an Ma and ends with xim canned the reviewer whose comments were clipped to put on the box.  ""It's Ben Stiller's funniest movie.""  What planet does that reviewer live on?!  Funniest movie?  Most definitely not.

This movie is proof that you can take most of the team that brought us Something about Mary and realize that Cameron Diaz must be a comic genius because without her you just don't get the desired effect.  Malin Akerman seems to be trying to channel Diaz but just can't pull it off.  Perhaps it's because in this movie, for the most part, it's the female lead that is serving as the brunt of the jokes where in Mary it was Stiller who kept having stupid things happen to him.  Eventually that happens in this movie too, but by the time it does happen you've probably given up on the idea that the movie will ever really be funny.

Part 40-year old virgin wannabe, part Something About Mary wannabe, and very few parts funny.  That is what is left at the end of this film.

I rated this at 2 stars.  It might rise to the level of 2.5 stars, but barely.  It is most definitely not the Farrelly brother's best work, nor is it the best from any of the others in the cast (except for perhaps the elder Stiller, but that likely isn't true either...)  Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language.  114 minutes of running time you should spend on other, better, films.

3280264,3,B00104AYSI,"Ben Stiller steps in with the Farrelly brothers one more time in ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  It's the story of Eddie (Stiller), an unmarried and seemingly unlucky in love man who's just attended his ex-girlfriend's wedding.  He's humiliated at the wedding by being placed at the ""singles"" table (kid's table) and made fun of indirectly during the toasts at the reception.  A few days later he has a run-in with a purse snatcher and meets Lila (Malin Akerman).  The two eventually become a couple.  After much coaching from his father (real life dad, Jerry Stiller) and his best friend and a very brief courtship, Eddie takes the plunge and marries Lila. Everything is perfect until Eddie meets Lila's mom who, genetically speaking, doesn't give him much to look forward to.  Things go from bad to worse while driving down to Cabo for their honeymoon.  It gets even worse as the honeymoon unfurls.  Eventually, Eddie runs into and falls in love with Miranda (Michelle Monaghan).  She's the perfect woman for him and nothing like the complete stranger he's married to.  From here, the viewer is spoonfed tired Farrelly gag after tired Farrelly gag.  Eddie gets into all sorts of situations (some funny, most not) trying to hide his new love from his wife and vice versa.

The film drags quite a bit, especially when Akerman and Stiller are interacting.  Sure, there are some funny sex scenes but there's nothing new to them as far as humor goes.  The funniest scenes involve Miranda's Mississippi family.  From Martin to ""Byoo,"" they keep this film afloat.

Stiller's character isn't that likeable of a guy.  Akerman is cute, but I felt as if I was watching a Farrelly brothers' knock-off of Cameron Diaz.  Monaghan is excellent in this film and is the only character that I became remotely interested in.  Carlos Mencia plays uncle Tito, one of the worst gag characters in Farrelly history.

If you're used to the trashy (and when executed perfectly, funny) humor of the Farrelly brothers, you'll probably get some pleasure from ""The Heartbreak Kid.""

3280284,4,B00104AYSI,"The films made by the Farrelly Brothers up to the point before this film had all been able to maintain a level of heart not seen before, or after in films containing some gross-out comedy. It's this blend of heart and knowledge of when to go for the kill that make them undeniably entertaining and they've made some great comedies with Mary and Dumb and Dumber being the bes, but all of their films up to this point has been immensely watchable.  With this film I think it may change for a lot people.  The heart of the brothers' is still in here but it's tonally different from anything they've released before. I think part of the reason is because they've approached this one from a previously existing framework and concept as opposed to an original idea based on genre (as all of their films are, which makes them so accessible on the surface). This film is funny and charming and contains heart, but part of the problem that a lot of people will have with the film is that when watching it you will be remembering the other films and no film makes you think of their other films like this one. The main reason for this, I think, is in the casting. Ben Stiller was the star of their most popular film his co star for a majority of the film is an actress who's unbelievably similar in numerous ways to Cameron Diaz who also starred in Mary. This film suffers by comparison because the aims of this movie are more sophisticated.  In their other films they had protagonists and other characters who did bad things and somehow you laughed at it because they were like harmless children who didn't know any better. Stiller's character in this film is different in that the Brother's attempt to make us feel for him as a mature adult while also recognizing that he does equally deplorable things, that may not seem deplorable at first, but end up being that way.  The end leaves you with a feeling that I'm not sure anyone would be prepared for knowing they were watching a film of the Farrelly's. This all results in a great juxtaposition of humor and light horror since the humor in this feels extremely dark, but really isn't. Watching it makes me long to see more of Malin Akerman, but I wonder if she'll last longer enough to get a distinctive role and hold onto it. We'll see. As for unfunny, the king of unfunny is in this movie and is the only reason I'm giving this a 4 star rating. Carlos Mencia has got to be the dryest no-talent comedian out there. Everything he does feels like a knee jerk reaction to what's going on in the world and what's worse, he never has a full comic persona so he halfs his performance in everything he does, this movie included.

3280307,1,B00104AYSI,"""Heartbreak Kid"" is a travesty of moviemaking. The only redeeming quality is the setting: the scenery is gorgeous, whether or not actually filmed in Cabo, Mexico.

The premise: A forty-year-old, never-married man, Eddy is the epitome of the male unable to commit for fear of finding the right woman just around the corner. That remains the premise to the last credit, regardless of so-called plot. Ben Stiller has done better, even though he too frequently plays the loser or near-loser with aplomb. He is definitely a loser in this film even though that is not how he plays it this time. And what is with his appearance? He has aged twenty years since ""Night at the Museum,"" at least a movie in which his losing character eventually wins. In this loser movie though, Stiller appears to have pumped up a few muscles for his sex scenes, but his extreme thinness makes him look awful

As for Jerry Stiller, who, haha, plays his father, he is such a caricature of himself. From his ""Seinfeld"" days to this role, the elder Stiller looks so cartoonish with his dyed hair and strange fashions. And the outrageous vulgarities he has to speak! Is he for real? The lovely Malin Ackerman is fixed in my memory now as this horrible she-witch. At least, she can act. Ditto for Michelle Monagham, the next heart to break.

If Uncle Tito is supposed to add humor, someone is seriously lacking in what passes for humor. He was not funny. Crude, cruel, and misguided. He is no Rob Schneider. Farrelly Brothers, I hold you responsible for this character disaster.

The ending? Is it better? My question is: Who would fall for this person in the first place? The movie's title implies fun to me. Heartbreak Kid. Whop-de-do! Break hearts! What fun!

3280308,3,B00104AYSI,"I'm writing this because too many reviewers are going crazy like The Heartbreak Kid was the worst movie ever made or something which is just ridiculous. Regarding 2007's comedies, Superbad and Knocked Up were both grossly overrated. They had about 20 minutes of funny parts each. It seemed like the producers just rushed them out the door without bothering to give them a couple of much needed rewrites and still the world has gone crazy over them. Personally, I laughed more consistently while watching The Heartbreak Kid. For my money, The 40 Year Old Virgin is the best comedy to have come out in the past three or four years as it is filled with laughs and has no long dry spells like Knocked Up, Superbad, and even The Heartbreak Kid to a lesser degree.

Does THK blaze new trails? No. Is it going to win Oscars or become a timeless classic? No. That said, it's got a lot of laughs and is definitely worth renting. I suspect it just became trendy to rag on it and now everybody's piling on. The same thing happened with The Cable Guy which is a great film, IMO. The Farrelly Brothers movies aren't all equal but they all have funny parts. If you liked Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me Myself and Irene, and Shallow Hal you should get a kick out of this one too, though you might not watch it repeatedly. If the other Farrelly Brothers movies gross you out or offend you with their utter disregard for political correctness, then steer clear. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can deny that the scenes were Lila shows her true colors as a sexually insatiable, tasteless halfwit with baggage galore are laugh out loud funny. Stiller's immigration troubles are great as well. Jerry Stiller wasn't given enough good lines to maximize his potential, which is unfortunate but certainly not a deal-breaker regarding the whole ""to see or not to see"" question. Also, I didn't find either of the leading ladies particularly fetching, though I did appreciate the cool, girl next door quailty of Miranda.

Malin Akerman and Michelle Monaghan provide OK support, but not much more, as the crazy bride and the girl he falls in love with, respectively (I  really don't get Monaghan's appeal, but maybe that's just me.)",1202515200,,708,4.430769230769231

This film has not a speck of playfulness (which is why most people enjoy the Farrelly Brothers). And, I assure you, I will think twice before investing in another of their works. They have forgotten their audience and reek of desperation. (Guys, you do not have to keep up with the new directors, just do your own thing!!)

In sum: I'm not advising you against watching it, I'm just suggesting that you rent it before you buy it. As far as this film is concerned, it is literally one of the worst directed (no need to delve into it here), worst (re)written (see for yourself), disasters of the year.",1201910400,17,3500,8.05699481865285

I would rather spend 2 hours getting paper cuts on the most sensitive parts of my body than to watch this movie again.  The plot is non-existent.  The weak attempt at humor is tasteless and just awful.  The acting is like a home movie that people forgot to turn the camera off and recorded two hours of nothing.  I am astounded at how bad this movie was.  I mean it wasn't even cult classic bad.  It made Army of Darkness seem like a modern art masterpiece.

3280316,3,B00104AYSI,"Situational comedy is something that Ben Stiller knows and knows how to do well. There's something About Mary and Meet the Parents are perfect examples of the kind of ""next door guy"" character he is known for. The Heartbreak Kid is yet another film about a guy who cannot find true love, but meets Miss Right who is not that ""right"" after all. Stiller is charming, the situational jokes are entertaining for the most part--perhaps raunchier that the movies I mentioned above--but the film looses momentum in the second act due to some flat soapy situations. despite its flaws; The Heartbreak Kid gets a passing grade even though the title of the film doesn't really go with our protagonist.

Brief Intro Story:
40-year old San Francisco bachelor Eddie Cantrow (Ben Stiller) is down and out because his former fiance is getting married--apparently he is afraid of commitment. To make things worse, he gets invited to her wedding only to get humiliated some more by his ex and her father--maybe he got invited for that very reason. On his way home, he sees a guy stealing a girl's purse. He tries to stop him, but he thief sprays some perfume on his eyes and gets away with her purse. Lila (Malin Akerman) thanks him for the effort and a romantic relationship begins. After some pressure from his eccentric father Doc (Jerry Stiller [Ben's real father]) and best friend to marry this woman, he finally does and they go to their honeymoon in Mexico.

While they are staying in the hotel, he finds out serious personality issues and ugly truths about Lila. He now thinks that he rushed to get married and made a huge mistake. In all of this confusion, he meets the beautiful Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) and they clicked instantly. What would happen to Lila? Will he tell her that he just got married?

Review:
Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly (Shallow Hal, There's Something About Mary) are veterans in the genre of situational romantic comedies. Most of them are pretty good so if you liked their early movies, you might like this one. They are not over the top with profanity and vulgarity like recent comedies as Knocked Up or Superbad. They do, however, add some unnecessary nudity with hit-or-miss sex jokes, but overall, they mostly work.

The first act of the film is brilliant. We get to know Eddie's personality. He is an easy going, charming, and down to earth next-door guy. Sometimes he could be insecure and involved in misunderstandings--think of Gaylord Focker from Meet the Parents--but unlike Focker, this time he is afraid of serious relationships. As I said earlier, he can do this kind of character with half of his brain. But the problems begin in the second act (in their honeymoon when he meets Miranda). The film drags now with soapy dilemmas like: Do I go out with this girl but I just got married? Should I tell her about my wife? These are burning question that Eddie asks himself, but this situation goes on for way too long with the jokes becoming scarce and more annoying characters in the horizon--the editing could have been much better here, perhaps they should have focused more on Eddie and Lila. In the end, the fun picks up a little bit, but the charisma of the protagonist seems to fade away.

The Verdict:
Not as funny as Meet the Parents and way raunchier than There's Something About Mary, The Heartbreak Kid probably won't disappoint Stiller's fans. He delivers the jokes the way he knows how, but the Soap-TV draggy moments and those hit-or-miss jokes take away some of the fun.",1200268800,,3519,4.743464052287582

This movie started off kind of dumb and boring and I was like, ""uh oh....another waste"".  Finally the story got interesting when he met the psycho girlfriend.  I was totally impressed with her performance (Mila Akerman?). She reminds me of Cameron Diaz. But if Cameron Diaz played the part of the girlfriend, I know I wouldn't have liked this movie, she's too over the top and self-aware and a crap actress.  What I loved about this movie is the unraveling of how much of a loser she turns out to be. I enjoyed watching Ben Stiller have to deal with her and slowly start to realize what he had got himself into.  I was like, ""ha ha, you ended up with a looneybird"".  If you have issues with men, you actually get enjoyment out of seeing him all dissapointed and screwed over.  There are some dull moments, it's not a perfect comedy, but overall, ""Hearbreak Kid"" had me laughing out loud in the genuine giddy way near tears.  It's extremely rare for me to laugh, I'm sort of jaded like everybody these days.  I think Ben Stiller is fantastic, and I loved Mila's performance,  she made the movie for me.

I tend to judge a comedy by the amount of laughs I get out of it and I had several ""lol"" moments in this movie. Sure, some of the humor is crude and some of it is done in bad taste, but that is to be expected in a Farrelly brothers movie. I thought the way that Stiller's character finds out all the bad and surprising history of his new bride was very entertaining.

3280335,2,B00104AYSI,"I'm a longtime fan of Ben Stiller's, but this movie left a bad taste in my mouth. What could have been a funny exploration of why some men fail to commit and why chemistry works with some and not others is totally lost in a mishmash of self-congratulatory, immature frat-boy humor (in the worst sense; I loved the frat-boy humor in Something About Mary and Knocked Up). I like Stiller best when he's paired with either a script or a lead actress with some heart, like in Meet the Parents, but in this movie the two actresses serve little function other than stereotypes on extreme ends of a testosterone-driven spectrum. For this movie to work, the wife must be truly awful on a grand scale, but I found myself feeling sorry for her and disliking Stiller's character more and more as the movie went on. The wife won't go deep-sea fishing. Horrors! She burns too easily! She thinks his nickname ""Ed"" is short for Edmund instead of Edward! That's grounds for divorce right there!

What can a man do? Only run to the arms of the dark haired salt-of-the-earth Mississippi girl who shoots tequila with gusto and laughs at his jokes. Monaghan is likeable but hardly transcends above the ideal good sport girl next door; there is no real personality that would set her so far above anyone else, that I could see.
Never explained is Ed and Lila spent 6 weeks together prior to nuptials and never discussed her job, their debts, their musical tastes, etc. Maybe there is a lesson to be learned there, but it isn't worth the two hours of life wasted on watching this movie.",1199232000,2,1563,4.582142857142857

First, I simply do not like Ben Stiller and second, I saw the original, loved it and feared being disappointed. I have to say, I was impressed. The charactor played by Michelle Monaghan was so delightfully inspiring and just down right adorable, any man that has a beating heart would have to fall in love with her. It is definately not a polically correct movie in any shape or form, nor was it intended to be. Maybe that's the reason so many are trashing it. But my personal philosophy is and always has been that, ""Polical Correctness"", is nothing more than tyranny against freedom of speech, stealthfully misplaced in mannerisms. Could the movie have been better? Sure, they probably could have cut about 12 mins. out of the beginning and removed some of the slapstick. But the acting was some of the best you will see in a comedy and for the most part it was pretty darn funny! So rent it and see for yourself. Just remember it was not made for children.

3280347,2,B00104AYSI,"There is a smattering of laughs in this 2007 comedy, the latest over-the-top concoction from the Farrelly Brothers, but the laugh quotient is not nearly enough to sustain interest in this particularly mean-spirited movie. Ostensibly a remake of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1972-Elaine-May-directed-comedy/dp/B00005R24E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1972 Elaine May-directed comedy</a>&nbsp;penned by Neil Simon, this film trivializes the original's overriding theme of the have-nots coveting the privileged lives of the haves by focusing more strictly on the premise of a lifelong bachelor who decides to marry only to find out it's a grave mistake and moves from one deception to the next to get out of it once he thinks he has found his soul mate. It should not come as a big surprise that Farrellys focus most of their attention on the humiliation and gross-out antics, but their techniques seem more contrived and their set-ups more scripted this time around, especially when Judd Apatow has done a better job humanizing such hi-jinks in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>. Moreover, the film shows a particularly cruel streak toward the two women involved in the shenanigans. The bloom may finally be off the hair goo.

The plot starts out promisingly in a particularly picturesque San Francisco (thanks to Matthew Leonetti's crisp cinematography) as Eddie Cantrow, the lonely owner of a San Francisco sporting-goods store, has a history of averting commitment in his long-term relationships. Turning forty and watching his last girlfriend of five years get married from the desperate kiddie table, he decides to throw caution to the wind when he meets Lila, a seemingly sweet blonde beauty, in a meet-cute situation involving a mugger. They get married after only six weeks of dating, but the marriage starts to unravel on the car trip down to their honeymoon destination, Los Cabos. One bad revelation after revelation comes out, and she evolves into a nightmarish freak with a free-flowing deviated septum. In a twist of fate, she suffers from severe sunburn and is stuck in the hotel room recovering. Enter Miranda, a good-humored girl-next-door from Mississippi in Los Cabos with her extended family. Naturally, Eddie and Miranda hit it off, and you can guess the rest.

Ben Stiller plays Eddie in familiar manic mode, though his character degenerates through the course of the story from likeable schlub to obsessive jerk. Some of the turns he takes are hilarious, like the out-of-kilter segment where he illegally crosses the border back from Mexico, but for the most part, he just feels like a sketch of a person. Malin Akerman deserves a medal for subjecting herself to a series of humiliations that turn her into an imbecilic harridan, while Michelle Monaghan provides a unique version of the ""dream girl"" as Miranda. It was a creative move to have a blonde bombshell like Akerman play the one Eddie tries to jettison, but the problem is that both she and Monaghan come across more as victims of their characters' stupidity than Eddie's machinations. By the end of this overlong movie, I became indifferent to anyone's fate as the story spits and sputters in the final stretch. As the final credits roll, there are two random scenes included that extend on the characters, but they aren't worth the wait.

The speedy end-of-2007 DVD release, less than three months after the original release, reflects its lackluster box office performance. Even so, there are a robust number of extras to be found. First off is Peter and Bobby Farrelly's informative commentary track which shows how seriously they took the venture despite the result. There is a decent 16-minute making-of featurette, ""The Farrelly Brothers in the French Tradition"", which was taped mostly on the set. Three shorts are more disposable - a sentimental interview with the father and son Stillers (Jerry plays Ben's irascible father), an irreverent look at an egg toss contest conducted during the production, and a quick video of the cast Halloween party. Six deleted scenes, a gag reel, and the original theatrical trailer round out the extras.",1199059200,2,4468,5.665671641791045

He marries a girl that he barely knows, realizes that she's not the person he thought she was (she's very disturbed, in a Farrelly Brothers sort of way) , meets a normal (and I might add very hot) girl while on his honeymoon, and falls in love with her.

An afront to thinking men, women and children this venture finds no value in Mexican culture nor the animal world (in a graphic scene of bestiality). Unfortunately, better cast members than BS are taken down with this sticky man of war and will no doubt regret all but the great Mexican beach location.

But then Lila (Malin Akerman, channeling Cameron Diaz) turns out to be the HellBride of Doom, and Stiller winds up trapped in Cabo with a woman he can't get away from.

About now is when the movie makes a sudden turn off a cliff, in my mind. Instead of keeping Stiller's Eddie as a lovable schmoe who has to wrestle the situation with smarts and heart, he turns into an absolute heel. He meets a Mississippi lady on vacation with her family, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), and before you can say ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">40-Year-Old Virgin</a>,"" Stiller is aping every bad man-sex cliche he can.

Rob Corddry jumps away from his Daily Show life to be a scene stealing p-ssy-whipped husband, and the Donkey Dance is a classic set piece.

These two comedic titans conspired to bring us the original movie The Heartbreak Kid (1972)--May directed and Simon wrote the screenplay, after adapting Bruce Jay Friedman's short story. That movie, with adept co-stars Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, amusingly captures irrepressible Jewish male angst and falling in impractical love. The current version drops into the prickly directorial hands of the Farrelly brothers (Fever Pitch)--once again reinforcing the notion that comedy necessitates flair, not impudence.

Ben Stiller (Night at the Museum) is Eddie Cantrow, a 40-year-old bachelor who owns a sporting goods store. Following the wedding of his ex-fianc of five years, he gets vulgar counsel about getting on with life and women, from both his 77-year-old dad (Jerry Stiller, Ben's father in real life) and browbeaten married friend Mac (Rob Corddry, Blades of Glory). With God (or the devil?) smiling upon him, Eddie meets Lila (Malin Akerman, The Brothers Solomon) when he intervenes as her purse is snatched (on Valentine 's Day-- contrived? you bet). Within weeks the two get married and honeymoon at a Mexico resort. There, Eddie rapidly realizes--thanks to Lila's irritating singing with the car radio, butchering of English (""Inhabitate is not a word""), preference for masochist sex, revealed unemployment, etc.--that he may have jumped a tad too quickly into marriage. Following a catastrophic sunburn, Lila stays hidden in their hotel suite. This leaves Eddie time to court the beautiful, and sports loving, vacationing Miranda (Michelle Monaghan, Mission: Impossible III). Eddie gets more than he bargained for, though, when he realizes he is falling into and out of love--all while still honeymooning.

Making his second Farrelly brothers turn (There's Something About Mary, 1998), Ben Stiller perpetuates his Everyman persona by appearing to be a bumbling yet reasonable guy--who, as events unfold, proves as morally bankrupt as everyone else in his life. With this, their 9th  directorial effort, I have come to expect coarse humor wrapped in the Farrelly brothers' unconventional (and now mechanical) boy gets-loses-gets girl package. In The Heartbreak Kid, the brothers cast an intensified spotlight on sophomoric behavior--love hurts, they reiterate and so does comedy when bungled with such fruitless ribaldry.

R for strong sexual content, crude humor and language.

3280356,2,B00104AYSI,"There is a smattering of laughs in this 2007 comedy, the latest over-the-top concoction from the Farrelly Brothers, but the laugh quotient is not nearly enough to sustain interest in this particularly mean-spirited movie. Ostensibly a remake of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1972-Elaine-May-directed-comedy/dp/B00005R24E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1972 Elaine May-directed comedy</a>&nbsp;penned by Neil Simon, this film trivializes the original's overriding theme of the have-nots coveting the privileged lives of the haves by focusing more strictly on the premise of a lifelong bachelor who decides to marry only to find out it's a grave mistake and moves from one deception to the next to get out of it once he thinks he has found his soul mate. It should not come as a big surprise that Farrellys focus most of their attention on the humiliation and gross-out antics, but their techniques seem more contrived and their set-ups more scripted this time around, especially when Judd Apatow has done a better job humanizing such hi-jinks in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>. Moreover, the film shows a particularly cruel streak toward the two women involved in the shenanigans. The bloom may finally be off the hair goo.

The plot starts out promisingly in a particularly picturesque San Francisco (thanks to Matthew Leonetti's crisp cinematography) as Eddie Cantrow, the lonely owner of a San Francisco sporting-goods store, has a history of averting commitment in his long-term relationships. Turning forty and watching his last girlfriend of five years get married from the desperate kiddie table, he decides to throw caution to the wind when he meets Lila, a seemingly sweet blonde beauty, in a meet-cute situation involving a mugger. They get married after only six weeks of dating, but the marriage starts to unravel on the car trip down to their honeymoon destination, Los Cabos. One bad revelation after revelation comes out, and she evolves into a nightmarish freak with a free-flowing deviated septum. In a twist of fate, she suffers from severe sunburn and is stuck in the hotel room recovering. Enter Miranda, a good-humored girl-next-door from Mississippi in Los Cabos with her extended family. Naturally, Eddie and Miranda hit it off, and you can guess the rest.

Ben Stiller plays Eddie in familiar manic mode, though his character degenerates through the course of the story from likeable schlub to obsessive jerk. Some of the turns he takes are hilarious, like the out-of-kilter segment where he illegally crosses the border back from Mexico, but for the most part, he just feels like a sketch of a person. Malin Akerman deserves a medal for subjecting herself to a series of humiliations that turn her into an imbecilic harridan, while Michelle Monaghan provides a unique version of the ""dream girl"" as Miranda. It was a creative move to have a blonde bombshell like Akerman play the one Eddie tries to jettison, but the problem is that both she and Monaghan come across more as victims of their characters' stupidity than Eddie's machinations. By the end of this overlong movie, I became indifferent to anyone's fate as the story spits and sputters in the final stretch. As the final credits roll, there are two random scenes included that extend on the characters, but they aren't worth the wait.",1192579200,4,3661,5.7652495378927915

8236751,1,B00104AYSI,"If I  could write a review with no stars I would. This movie is so offensive on so many levels.  It takes marriage and makes a mockery of it.  Several sexual references are just down right disgusting,  not funny. The stereotypes they portrayed were offensive. Stiller's character has no redeeming qualities,  even though his new wife is painted as an undesirable match for him. The only likable characters in the whole movie are the other girl he falls in love with and her family. Ben Stiller truly played a horrible part. If he was supposed to be the romantic lead, he missed the mark, big time! All you want to do throughout the movie and even at the end, is yell at this poor girl, run away, run away!

The 1972 version of this script is so outstanding, and this is such a bust.  Silly, inane, pointless, completely disappointing.  The role of Lila is completely miscast...the actress tries hard to be disagreeable but she is far too attractive.  Jeannie Berlin (in the original) is very attractive, however, she manages to make  her character rise above physicality...acting, direction, I don't know.  In this film the entire point of the story is lost...it should not be just  about a hasty marriage of two people who are not a match, but a cultural commentary.  That is not addressed in this film.  Don't watch unless you have seen or plan to see the original 1972 version .  It is well photographed.",1514764800,,816,4.883211678832117

8236754,3,B00104AYSI,"I must have watched the time-honored original ""Heartbreak Kid"" 4 times over the years since 1972.  So I was expecting an updated version of that classic.  I did not notice this movie was by the Farrelly brothers or i would have known better, and that I should expect a wild comedy instead.  That said I guess if you are a fan of off the wall comedy then it doesn't disappoint--but it was not my cup of tea, though I do like Ben Stiller and he most likely fulfilled the role of being a sympathetic down-on-his-luck funny character.  I just hope the Farrelly brothers don't get ahold of ""The Last Picture Show"" for a remake.  I will be sure to check who is making that one.",1514332800,,671,4.336
