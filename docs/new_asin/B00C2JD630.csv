Two Canadian brothers take on their adventure to circumnavigate the country in a mere 65 day adventure to help us see it's never ending challenges, changes and future.

5688872,5,B00C2JD630,"I planned on watching one episode, and ended up watching the whole series in one sitting. The Middle Kingdom Ride is an amazing way to see the side of China that we are not normally exposed to, and also a funny view into the relationship between two brothers. I'm not a motorcycle guy at all, but the series is more about seeking adventure and overcoming the challenges along the way.

5688874,5,B00C2JD630,"The Middle Kingdom Ride chronicles 2 brothers journey to circumnavigate China by motorcycle. This is a major undertaking by anyone, particularly for two Canadian brothers one of which doesn't speak or read the native language, the other only somewhat so fluent in Mandarin making it difficult to locate such things as ferry entrances in their efforts to not get too lost, too often: arranging lodging and avoiding getting scammed by overpaying for services leading to a very expensive trip. Ultimately the brothers traveled 18,000 km in 65 days in extreme weather conditions from extreme cold and ice, torrential rains and dessert sands.

When a book is turned into a video, generally I prefer the book however in this case the video is amazing! The book chronicles many of the actual events that occurred, there are some descriptions of the local scenery but it is mostly in terms of how it affected their journey, not the actual scenery. In this regard the video is top notch as it highlights more of the scenery in China that's missing from the book version.

The Middle Kingdom Ride is worthwhile reading or watching, it's an interesting twist to visiting a foreign country and leaving all the tourist destinations behind.",1423872000,,1226,4.975609756097561
5688875,5,B00C2JD630,"I have always been fascinated by China, its landscapes, history and culture. A Westerner like myself can only imagine the wealth of knowledge and experience the Pyle brothers were privy to. And here it is, a documented trip to the most remote parts of this enigmatic country, rife with regular people like you and me, and happily living a life of their choice.

It was gratifying to see the remote areas, and to know that hospitality is so generous. Kids will be kids, and they are no different there than here. Seeing the end of the Great Wall was fascinating, and the trip into Manchuria (and the North Korean border) might've been more substantial, but bad weather prevented that. If you want to see Heavenly Lake, you'll have to go online.

It looks like it was possibly filmed as a TV reality show, but, regardless, it was as riveting as any ""home video"" adventure I've seen. The Pyle brothers are to be commended on many levels, mostly for the courage they displayed as they endured some pretty rough set-backs. Anyone could say they did such a trip, but having it documented in such a no-frills way was courageous and impressive.

I just can't say enough about how much I truly appreciated the endeavor.  Anyone remotely interested in the mystery of China, the REAL China, would be hard pressed to find a more thorough, fascinating and detailed account. BRAVO to all involved!  Highly recommended.",1423526400,,1404,4.761316872427984
5688876,5,B00C2JD630,"This 2 disc DVD set  is a video diary of a world record setting motorcycle journey around China. Yes, these guys received a certificate from the Guiness World Record folks after their journey.  This is not a reality show which is mostly fabricated, this is the real thing.  The good, the bad, all types of terrain and all types of weather are shown as they actually experienced it.  There are no recreations of events after the fact.  An interesting story of these two brothers and a close look at what I think is one of the most mysterious countries in the world.  If you want to get a good idea of the vastness, diversity, and beauty of China this 2 and a half hours is well worth the investment.  Highly recommended.",1423526400,,719,4.442748091603053
5688877,5,B00C2JD630,"Now THIS is what I call travel! None of that guided tour, tourist trap, souvenir buying here! I received a copy of the DVD for review. Not my typical stuff, but hey, I'm into adventure. And this definitely brings it.

Somewhere back in my younger years I would have jumped at the chance to take a motorcycle on any adventure, let alone going to another country. These brothers don't make it look like a walk in the park. They make it look exactly like it is: rough and rugged. You're not going to see these guys promoting Perillo tours any time soon. Although you might see them pass a tour bus on their way out of town and into the ""real world"".
The landscapes in the video are breathtaking. The shots of real life outside of the China megacities shows you just what life is like. Heck, just trying to get parts for their bikes was a MAJOR issue! All the issues, all the tumbles, it's all there. And they tell it like it is with the f-bomb thrown in a few times. Not an issue for me, but if you are freaky about it just be warned.
I originally intended to just watch a bit before I had to get some honey-do's out of the way. The honey-do's became honey-I'll do it later. I ended up watching all of it in one sitting. Then I watched it again with family later. My only complaint, I would have liked to see more ride time rather than video diary. Problem is, if you take out any of the video diary, then you lose a little of the ""feel"". Hearing what these guys had to say, watching their attitudes about the ride, and the other commentary really added to the entire experience. I guess they will just have to come out with another vid.

Whether you have any intentions of duplicating their ride or not, this is an enjoyable video. It piqued interests that I didn't realize I had. I never had much interest in China, until I watched this. Seeing the country like it is and not displayed through the lens of tourism or government agencies. No big name film companies involved. Just two brothers rekindling their love of adventure and family, and taking you along for the ride. Don't take that to mean boring vacation videos. These guys have skills behind the camera and this is very professionally done. This is more like something you would see on the Discovery Channel or Travel Channel. It's one I will be sharing and watching again.",1423440000,2,2333,4.38568129330254
5688878,5,B00C2JD630,"I've watched this several times now, and have truly enjoyed it each time!  Having lived in Toronto myself and now in Michigan with a business who manufactures in China, I've always (like most) thought of China as over-populated, filthy, etc. etc.  I now, want to visit and travel throughout China.

Two brothers, leaving the Rat Race of the West and documenting an amazing motorbike adventure around China.  Never done before, and an opportunity of a life-time.  Taking you along with them through their challenges in the desert, snow, flooding, traffic jams, break-downs, and so forth.  You soon learn that the majority of China is rural, and from one village/city to another, nobody looks the same.  The cultures vary tremendously.

A few things that I really loved were:

*  The movie Wall St. (1987 original) was your inspiration...Classic!
*  Toe-crossing the ""line"" at the border of North Korea had me in a laughing fit!
*  Handing out candy to children who only knew 2 English words ""Hello"" & ""Money"" - yet they seemed so happy

I'm sure you both learned so much on this journey and most of all, reconnected as siblings.

I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon shopper.",1423180800,,1310,4.713656387665198

5688880,5,B00C2JD630,"Recently I read the e-book, The Middle Kingdom Ride, written by Ryan and Colin Pyle.  It was an awesome adventure two brothers endured riding their motorcycles around the borders of China.  It excited me and the video is just as exciting to see the actual trip, the tiredness they felt from time to time, the tension of riding without permission on some of the Chinese roadways, and the extreme weather changes.  The photographer does an exemplary job of editing and producing this film which is on two DVDs.  These brothers have set themselves challenges which they meet no matter how difficult.  If you dream of adventure, this film will inspire you to meet your dreams as Ryan and Colin Pyle do.",1422748800,,698,4.735537190082645
5688881,5,B00C2JD630,"Spellbinding! This is almost too hard to believe! It's enough to travel that far... on a motorcycle... and in China! The filming is almost unbelievable. I felt as though I was right there with the brothers. I saw sights that I never imagined! Those guys have certainly captured a lifetime of memories on this unusual trip. This video is extremely enjoyable and I can certainly recommend it, whether you are a motorcyclist, an adventurer, a traveler, or interested in seeing China. This is the one for you!",1422489600,,505,4.816091954022989
5688882,3,B00C2JD630,"I'm an adventure motorcycle rider and have been from before that term was coined. Adventure riding means riding to often remote places often with poor infrastructure and marginal or missing altogether roads. A major element of adventure riding is self-reliance. The nature of sketchy infrastructure is that you don't have support in the form of mechanics or dealers or even parts during much of your ride.

This is a nice and well shot travelogue about two Canadian brothers who buy F series BMW's in Shanghai and take off for a round trip of China. They include Tibet as a province of China which will irk some, I'm sure. The problem I had with these brothers is that they fail to plan properly, are anything but self reliant and are, at best, inexpert bike riders who hope to survive via the help of a sag wagon Toyota's crew. Weirdly, the Toyota breaks down along the way.

Here's an example of failing to plan. They expect to travel to several places great in elevation as they pass through or by the Himalayas. They fail to take adequate clothing which may be a failure to plan or an example of their lack of bike experience. Anybody whose ever ridden at these elevations could tell them that electric cloths are mandatory. Instead, we're regaled by these guys complaining about being cold - at one point so cold they park the bikes and can't get one started afterwards so they fail to achieve their day's goal.

In another breathtaking example of ineptitude, one of the brothers gets a flat tire. Getting that fixed is something a typical 8 year old dirt bike rider has already mastered but these guys need to load the entire bike on a flat bed tow truck so it can be repaired in a distant city.

Seeing the China sights was great and like the DVD said over and over, this is not one's general idea of what China is, but this rider got annoyed over and over by seeing the poor bike techniques exhibited by these clowns, listening to the repetitious narrative (one brother calls everything 'unbelievable' x 1001) and seeing how dependent these fellows were.

My guess would be that this is a series better enjoyed by those who don't know just how pathetic these brothers were on this ride not as people but as riders. It rankled.",1422489600,,2234,4.5889724310776945
5688883,5,B00C2JD630,"I was thrilled to get a set of DVDs to review for this awe-inspiring adventure, and immediately sat through both disks, hating for the story to end.

The adventure cannot help but conjure up memories of ""The Long Way Round"", a trip done by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman. However, Ryan and Colin Pyle, two Canadian brothers, have done Ewan and Charley one better, at least in China, by circumnavigating the entire country. From horrid scenes of Shanghai traffic to splendid vistas of barren desert and snow capped mountains in Tibet, this trip will keep you pinned to your seat, taking in breathtaking scenery after breathtaking scenery and scary motorcycle accidents in some of the remotest areas of the planet. But the brothers are undaunted, and instead of giving up, the rigors and dangers of the road only serve to strengthen their resolve to complete the journey.

As someone who has seen a bit of China myself, and an avid motorcyclist, I am simultaneously appalled and enthralled at these two intrepid brothers thumbing their noses at the elements in what had to have been one of the ultimate experiences of a lifetime. Thumbs UP!",1422403200,,1141,4.876288659793815
5688884,3,B00C2JD630,"You saw it on 'Tough Rides' now own your own DVD!  I accepted an invitation to review this set because I was interested in an 'inside' look around China--a big and 'happening' country.  Anyone who likes BMW bikes and road adventures will think this set is AT LEAST okay.  Other reviewers like it even better than that.  The brothers are talented and likable and the challenge they have taken up is pretty 'extreme.' Production values and sound are professional class. Viewers WILL see plenty of footage of challenging roads and 'sorta' roads.  Our two heroes get to face a lot of bad weather--particularly mud and rain and chilly temperatures.  Naturally, that is what we see, too.  They do have some sort of support network/camera crew traveling with them but...they also are undertaking a journey that will test them physically and mentally and that will break their bikes in a country where BMW spares are difficult to impossible to get.  They take spills.  This type of trip is not for amateurs and it looks from time to time like they could have been a bit more thorough in their pre-trip planning.  I would have welcomed more footage on that subject.

We do see some sacred spots (some look rather bleak and not worth the ride) and we get a basic look at some industrial settings, some out of the way village life, some spectacular scenery...but mostly viewers see 'road' and traffic.  The bikes and the cameras keep moving and human contact is brief, important to the continuation of the journey, and otherwise superficial.  Bikers dreaming about their own long-distance adventures can take useful notes about making better preparations.  The brothers are already planning to do their next ride--around India...and that DVD is already for sale on Amazon.  Don't let your wives or mothers watch this if you are planning a similar adventure!",1422144000,,1846,4.890675241157556

This is awesome. These two brothers are far tougher and more courageous than meets the eye.

On surface it seems a reasonable trek. Hell, it's just two guys on their motorcycles going across country. Remember Then Came Bronson? No big deal, in this age of computers, Internet, videocams and GPS, what's the big deal, right?

A 12,000 bike ride with several hundred miles at an altitude of 15,000 feet of uninhabited wilderness or several thousand miles of roads blocked by mud slides or passing through horrendous buckets of cold, pelting rain...or hot, dry dusty gravel roads....well, you gain an appreciation for the risks taken by these two men from Canada.

I first lived in Egypt when I was about Ryan's age. Several years later I lived in Libya. In both countries, I found myself in a fresh, new land that, at the same time, was as ancient as mankind. What I mean is, both nations were newly re-opened to the outside world. As such, they were isolated from most modernity. In essence, they were a museum of an earlier time. In the eighties, when an Egyptian called to order a phone line, it was a two year wait.

So, had I to do it all over again, I would have loved to do in Egypt and Libya what Ryan and Colin did in the Middle Kingdom of China.

I earnestly believe there are two fabulous methods to explore: horseback or by bikeback.

I delighted in viewing the complimentary two-disk video provided to me in exchange for an honest review.

One note of caution. The narration or side comments, as you will. Do include the occasional mule skinner's f-bomb. Although I was not bothered by this, I do know a few people might be upset.

Overall, I heartily, with no reservation, recommend this video that will give you an understanding, free of stereotypes, of the vast variety evident in China today.

A fabulous journey by two modern Marco Polo guys.",1422057600,4,1880,4.635542168674699
5688886,4,B00C2JD630,"Brothers Pyle take off on a pair of modified BMW motorcycle to traverse China on a 65 day, 18,000 km tour of China.  Starting and ending in Shanghai, the brothers ride to the North Korean border, through Inner Mongolia, across the Silk Road and Xinjiang, then turn South to the Pakistani border, Tibet, Mt. Everest Base Camp and through the Yunnan and Guangdong Province.

It is a striking example of the multitudes of various climates within China: desert, rolling fields, mountains, isolation, and urban sprawl.  Roads vary greatly on this journey and a few spills happen along the way.  Lake Longmu, which is 5200m above sea level, is this beautiful lake near mountains and dirt roads without a population near.  It is literally just a lake out in the middle of China.  There are many interesting scenes in this collection.

The DVD is surprisingly high quality:  The footage, graphics, audio are for the most part something you'd see on broadcast.  Who knew sheep and Yak poo could be used in lieu of wood for fires?  Well, you do now.  I would have liked to see more sequences of the environment, but they had to balance scenery with the ups/downs of the motorbike journey. In all, this is a fun video that allows the viewer to see the various images from China.

5688887,5,B00C2JD630,"Two brothers from Canada (one living in China) take a once-in-a-lifetime, motorcycle ride circumventing the country of China. Its a 65 day, 18,000 km (over 11,000 miles) journey that will surprise and challenge them both in a way no one could expect. Culminated into six episodes in a cleverly edited documentary style, the brother s (and driver) are covered with helmet, motorcycle, car and diary cams to record the journey as if you were there. It took a lot of strength, bravery and determination to complete this journey to share with the world.

Colin and Ryan Pyle being their journey in densely populated and polluted Shanghai heading north toward North Korea, head west to the Gobi desert, the end of the Great Wall, many large glacial lakes, remote villages, the border of Pakistan, the base camp of Mount Everest and the southern-to northeast journey back to Shanghai. Along the way, the viewer is treated to scenes of 100-mile long traffic jams, floods, landslides, motorcycles accidents, freezing cold, torrential downpours and sand storms.

But within these adventure lie the beauty of the land of China with its small ancient villages, the enormously friendly and physically diverse Chinese people, amazing stretches of beautiful desolation, the 3rd lowest spot on earth, huge mountain palaces, stunning views, Mount Everest and in every town they stay in, there is a wonderful story of kin-ship with the generous villagers who take them in with gregarious generosity.

The challenges don't simply lie with riding a motorcycle throughout the trip, but the frequent breakdown of machine and possibly man under bad circumstances. With no time to order parts, the Pyle brothers made do with what local car shops can manage. They also manage to recruit a few eager helpers along the way, happy to be part of this adventure. This s not the China most people expect.

The story is original, humors and challenging. The scenery is breathtaking. The Chinese are fascinating. The least of all these great achievements is that the trip made the Guinness Book of World Records and that speaks volumes.",1419552000,,2104,5.072254335260116
5688888,5,B00C2JD630,"I didn't know WHAT to think after getting this, double DVD----6-episode----documentary.
The only experience that I have with motorcycles is from my wilder----""daze""----days. I won't relate
THAT part of MY life, other than to say I lived through it; so did Colin and Ryan Pyle.
Our experiences were different. My adventure was in a blizzard, after a bachelor party, with a borrowed
Harley. THEIR 18,000 kilometer adventure was shorter than some of MY adventures... longer than most.
I helped tow a ship from Guam to Texas. That involved getting from The Pacific to the Atlantic via The
Panama Canal. I've been on the Transiberian Express. I made it back from Vietnam in the 'sixties... but,
I've never been on a 2-wheel vehicle longer than TWO hours. I'm content to sit back on my COUCH, and
watch THE PYLES get all those saddle-blisters and cracked ribs!

The Pyle brothers did MUCH more than I ever dared to... and on only TWO wheels! What an adventure!

One brother was a successful---Canadian equivelant of a---Wall Street banker. He sold his house, quit
his job, and joined his brother that has lived in CHINA (of all places!)for over 11 years. I can understand
THAT, though. I've got an itch in my shoes too. I'm a 65-year-old, retired military man that has lived in
Germany the past 21 years. Since the age of 19---after a Jimi Hendrix concert and a draft notice call-up---
I have lived all over the world. I returned to America in 1973, left in 1976, and have returned only once,
for four years, in the '90s.

I UNDERSTAND the travelling bug. I do. I've had bullets buzzing past my head, and often. I'm adventurous,
and I'm a really big fan of the Pyle COUSINS: Goober and Gomer. The BROTHERS: Colin and Ryan, may SEEM
to be almost as ""goofy"" to most people [that've never been outside of their home country].

The Pyle brothers set out to see all they could---on BMW motorcycles---driving around China [for 65 days].

They have a Guiness World Record.

They started out in Shanghai. Neither a mechanic, but learned along the way. Six EXCELLENT 26-minute epi-
sodes, they're in Shanghai again... planning a trip around INDIA. Ah! I've never been to India... but I WAS
on a ship during the Indian/Pakistan War and circled Sri Lanka [then, Ceylon] for a few months.

I enjoyed THIS so much, I'll buy THAT [next] series... after I finish reading the book about the adventure:

Their motorcycle ride was one filled with challenges, a test of endurance and will, which are recorded in the DVD and book.

5688891,5,B00C2JD630,"My daughter and I had planned on watching just one or two episodes, but ended up watching the entire series in one evening.
I ride motorcycles, and love a good adventure.  I had imagined that it would focus on the motorcycle-end of things, but it didn't.  They had a chase-vehicle carrying their luggage, so they didn't have to deal with the hardships of cross-country riding the way that you do when you do it without a chase vehicle.  Knowing that they had this SUV behind them kind of took away the ""dangers"" and ""hardships"" of riding around the country.  I'm not saying that they didn't have a hard ride--they did.  Rain, ice, snow, sand storms...they hit it all (and fell a few times).  But it's in the back of your mind when you watch this--they have someone in a truck videotaping and making sure they're okay.

This best part of the movie focused on China--the beauty, the people, the goodness that we never hear about.  We both really enjoyed the ""real-life"" aspect of this movie, and now have a totally different view of China than we are given by our U.S. media outlets.
I had no idea that China was so pretty!  It was heartwarming to see the happiness, generosity, kindness, and love of the Chinese people.  The landscapes are amazing.  The different weather patterns were awesome.
There definitely are urban issues in China.  The pollution, traffic, and craziness are all exactly what you've heard about..but the people are patient and happy.

The two brothers are likable--very real, and unedited (language alert for those who are sensitive to these things).  Seeing their relationship was heartening, and how the older brother wanted to watch out for the younger brother.

This is a quality documentary, and we thoroughly enjoyed watching.  It opened our eyes to a surprising side of China.

Colin and Ryan Pyle are two brothers; the younger, Colin, lives in Canada, while Ryan has been living in Shanghai, China for ten years.  He is a seasoned veteran who knows some of the Chinese language; also, he has traveled extensively in the country.  Ryan has convinced his brother Colin to take a motorcycle trip around the circumference of China, a very long and what will turn out to be an arduous trip.

The two brothers plan to take approximately sixty days to go completely around the country on their brand new BMW motorcycles.  They have a trailing vehicle with much of the gear they will need to make this long and difficult trip.  Also, a person in the trailing vehicle will shoot video footage of Colin and Ryan on their bikes and the scenery they pass through each day.  The boys have their own video cameras on their person and film their adventure as they are riding along and also when they stop at places of interest along the way.

It is fair to say they found many places of interest in China.  I was most interested in the Chinese cities they visited.  Throughout the entire trip the Chinese people the boys met in the cities and on the road were friendly and welcoming.  They invited the boys into their homes for dinners and socializing.  When the boys had mechanical problems with their bikes, they found mechanics who often were able to fix the problems.

Tough Rides is reality television.  Anyone who decides to buy this DVD should understand that often the pictures will look like they have been taken by an amateur, not a professional filmmaker.  Also, the weather did not help with the filming. Sadly, the boys encountered much rain along the way, which was both dangerous and uncomfortable riding their bikes and made getting good film footage difficult.

That said, the film the boys and their crew shot was on balance very good.  The boys were more impressed with the scenery they encountered along the way than I was, but they were on the ground in person and I was watching on TV.

As mentioned earlier, what I was most impressed with was the people and their cities and towns.  Ryan, the older brother who turned thirty-two on the trip, loves China and it is easy to see why.  It is a large country, just a tiny bit smaller than the United States, if we include Alaska.  1.357 billion people live in China, whereas we have 318.9 million - that's over a billion more people in a country just about our size in terms of space available to live.  The boys discovered that any stereotypes we have about the Chinese are wrong.  There is tremendous diversity in this great country.

I watched the entire series of films at one sitting - not quite three hours of viewing.  The time passed quickly because I was most interested in the subject matter and it was easy for me to relate to the boys and their adventure.  For anyone interested in China, the land and its people, I don't think they will be disappointed with this series of reality television.",1442707200,,3200,4.548951048951049
8576566,5,B00C2JD630,"This is the motorcycle ride around China with two brothers. One is an expat in China, and one is visiting his brother for this epic bike ride. They say in the video that nobody has every motorbiked around China before, but I'm pretty sure that's not true. But, it's probably true that nobody has motorbiked around China on the huge bikes that they imported into China.

It's kind of a wanna-be reality show, and it has a great mix between raw unadulterated reality and some really cool visual images of different parts of China. China is such a huge country, and these videos really demonstrate how varied and interesting China is. Because they're on motorcycles most of the time, then this mostly shows awesome scenery and landscapes. There are also a few parts where they interact with people in the cities.

Overall, this is awesome, especially if you're someone who wants to take a motorbike trip in a foreign country.

Pros:
+Excellent visual imagery
+Fun adventure of two Canadians in China
+A visual ride through all of China
+Great basic introduction to Chinese culture

Cons:
-A little slow at times

I actually found more value in the book, however, I must admit that some of the visuals in this DVD are just so stunning that it makes one look on in awe at so much of the beauty they encountered on the trip. One minor complaint, namely that I would have preferred it if they had not included a retrospective at the start of tracks two through five since in my view it wasn't necessary.",1427241600,,439,4.116279069767442

Each episode starts off with a quick review of the previous episode and each ends with a quick preview of what is to come.

The ""ride"" is a documentary with a family video feel.  The book with the same title compliments the DVDs with additional comments and notations about the journey that are not in the video.  The documentary is more personal than many where you may either just hear a voice or have a person walking/standing in front of the camera and telling you a bunch of facts.  We get a sense of being right there with the brothers and the camera crew through the good and the not-so-good journey.",1427155200,,772,4.439716312056738
8576569,5,B00C2JD630,"Very unusual subject matter for me, but everyone needs a little change now and then, eh? Variety, as they say, is the spice of life.

I recently had the opportunity of a review copy of this book (and the associated DVD) and rearranged my reading schedule to fit it in. Nearly everything I read is historical, where it be fiction or non-fiction, but my love of travel and adventure is strong too, and I am a sucker for travelogues on TV, so I jumped at this chance.

Amazingly, this tremendous journey, painstakingly documented in both text and film, was carried out by the two stars from their own funds. They did not receive the financial and logistical backing of the BBC or Nat Geo, or any of the great media groups that usually produce such series. They did not get given special treatment from the authorities as media stars. They were not donated bikes. They used up their savings, sold a house, quit jobs and did it themselves. Did what? you ask Oh yeah. Heres what they did:

Ryan Pyle is a freelance photographer from Canada whos lived in Shanghai for a decade now. He loves China. He loves the culture and the people and has been documenting it with his camera now for years. Hes also an enthusiastic, if relatively amateur, motorcyclist. His brother Colin owned a company back in Canada, but was tiring of the life and sought adventure  and hes also a biker! So from Ryans enthusiasm and Colins need for change was born the idea of the Middle Kingdom Ride. The Middle Kingdom, you see, is a phrase derived from Chinas name for itself, based on the principle that China was at the centre of its world. Ryan had this crazy idea that the two brothers could leave behind work and ordinary life  including, most wrenchingly, their wives  and take two bikes and a small support crew and ride around the circumference of China. China hold the longest unbroken border that can be driven or ridden, and to do so would not only be fascinating and an amazing achievement, but it would also be a world record.

Ryan and Colin sought financial and logistical support, but the deals they made fell through, leaving them alone. Not to be thwarted, the pair decided that they would do what they intended, with or without support. And so they found a filmmaker who was enthusiastic over the idea, who would travel behind the bikes in an SUV. And through careful planning around the route, arranged a series of local guides from each region who would join the support vehicle for a section of the trip. That was it. Two brothers on bikes, and two men in an SUV behind them.

So thats the background. As for the ride itself? Well suffice it to say that, despite having recently watched Sue Perkins Mekong journey and Levison Woods Walking the Nile, this journey was at least up there with the others, and was actually better than them in some ways. The journey has everything, because the brothers are not just riding bikes around the country, they are also immersing themselves in the culture at every opportunity. Thus we are treated to seeing the more draconian side of the Chinese administration, the life of Mongolian peasants from their own level, oppressed-yet-rebellious Tibet, tourist-oriented river journeys and everything in between. One thing that struck me throughout was how friendly and helpful and genuinely interested almost everyone they met seemed to be.

Then there were the hiccups. From broken bikes to more broken bikes, to two broken bikes at the same time, to almost uncrossable terrain, to impassable landslides, to forbidden expressways with angry policemen, to whole forbidden regions, the world seems to batter the pair on a regular basis. And yet, the brothers continually push down the disappointments and fears and overcome to push on. Even with the requisite number of falls  some of them quite hard, too. Anyone whos ridden a bike will probably tell you that a fall is inevitable at some point. I myself have come off one a few times, though never badly. All I would say it that, given the terrain across which these two rode, it is just astounding that they didn't fall more often.

I won't delve any deeper into the content of the journey, as thats for the reader/watcher to discover for themselves.

I read the book and then watched the DVD, and if you feel like doing both, that is most definitely the order in which to do it. The DVD will allow you to picture what you have already read, and the  by necessity  sparser detail in the DVD is best approached by having read the book and being able to fill in the blanks as it were

The DVD matches up in its production to any of the travelogues you will catch on TV. Using footage from the support crew as well as from the helmet cameras of both riders and their video diaries at the days end, the film-maker has done an excellent job of production. It is a thoroughly professional piece. Split into six episodes it allows you to in some way, join in with the ride, and experience some of what the brothers felt and saw. I have two minor criticisms of the DVD. One was the length of the introduction and previously on at the start of each episode, which had to be sat through to get to the film (though this is a common problem Ive found with travelogues and in no way unique to this DVD!) And the other is that in places the sound is not so good. Of course, that is occasioned by the fact that this was a proper adventure with only two men supporting, not a whole film crew with a mic boom and so on. So the sound you hear on the film is not the clean sound of the large-scale documentary film-maker, but the real sound of the journey. And while that means that sometime you might have to listen hard to hear over the truckstop noises, it does mean that you are truly immersed in the journey. So I suppose in retrospect they're not so much criticisms, as comments. The DVD does not have the level of detail that the book has, of course, so as I suggested earlier, if you get both book and DVD, read the book first. However, the DVD is well enough produced and written that if you don't read the book, you won't know you're missing the minutiae, and the DVD will still be a treat to watch. Really, the scenery alone makes it worthwhile, to be honest.

So there you go: two brothers, two motorcycles, 18,000 kilometers. One of the most fascinating, varied, and well-documented journeys you will get to read or see. And now, it seems, the brothers have gone on to ride around the edge of India next!",1426723200,,6475,4.535561268209083
8576570,5,B00C2JD630,"When Canadian brother Colin and Ryan Pyle set out from Shanghai on a motorbike journey that had never been attempted, they thought they a somewhat of an idea of what lay before them. It was a misconception that was evident by the end of Day 1. But, despite the many challenges they faced, 65 days and 18,000 km later they'd succeeded in circumventing China.

When a book is turned into a movie I always prefer the book as it allows you to imagine the scenery and what the characters are feeling. But, this movie is the exception to that. I really enjoyed the movie, but you have to read the book too.

Anyone that is planing a trip around China on a motorcycle you need to watch this!",1425427200,,684,4.3359375

Let me start by saying that I am more of a reader than television watcher, so while I figured I would like these dvds, I wasn't expecting to enjoy them as much as I ultimately did. It shows many different places in this gigantic country. Some locations were surprisingly similar to places here in the U.S., while others were breathtakingly different and beautiful. This was exactly what I would expect of this type of presentation. What I didn't expect was how much I would enjoy the interplay between the brothers and the people they met.

It's obvious the brothers love each other with all that entails (teasing, prods, freaking out when the other gets hurt, laughing, bickering- the whole thing), and it added so much more than just a standard travelogue. Their interaction with the people they met were also interesting. At one point they end up in a courtyard where monks go everyday to talk philosophy and debate, and I'll tell you- I wanted to BE THERE. It's these small interactions that made us watch every evening, and wish there had been more when it ended.",1425427200,,1241,4.610859728506787
8576572,5,B00C2JD630,"This is a review of The Middle Kingdom Ride DVD. I was provided with a free copy of the DVD for review.

I'm not trying to increase sales here, but seriously, if you are interested in this journey, you should read the book AND view the DVD. The book contains info that is not in the DVD and the DVD contributes visually, in a stunning way, the landscape of China and the rigors of the ride in a way the book cannot.

This incredible journey, a circumnavigation around the China continent on motorcycles, is  quite a ride. The two brothers had pretty much everything but the kitchen sink thrown at them during this journey. They somehow managed to survive this epic journey relatively unscathed, although there were some very serious situations they encountered that could have ended very differently.

I love how the DVD complements the book. The DVD shows the vast amount of contrast that China provides. It's produced quite well and was engrossing.

For the short amount of planning that these guys actually did in preparation for this journey, I'm actually quite surprised it ended as well for them as it did.

Can't wait to read about their trip around India.",1424995200,,1163,4.704433497536946
