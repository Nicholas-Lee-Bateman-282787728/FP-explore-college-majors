8034096,4,B0002XBCRU,"This tape is very ""rich"" with information and techniques.  There is a lot of information to dissect in this tape and it bears multiple viewings.  It is not for someone without a martial arts background after the fist 5 minutes.  This video is a good reference for people that have a background in Jeet Kune Do or Wing Chung, escrima, and knowledge of the human pressure points.  Features that I particularly liked are:

* Demonstrating how the short stick can be substituted by a folding knife or a small flash light (practicle)

* Joint locks and take downs

* Attacking the pressure points

*  Multiple striking options after the initial contact

* Examples of free flowing drills",1126828800,2,682,4.752136752136752
