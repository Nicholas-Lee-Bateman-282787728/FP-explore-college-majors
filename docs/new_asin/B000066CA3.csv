Reggie Bannister, better known for ""Phantasm"", also kicked but as a cop!
The movie has a story where everyone shares the same real-world nightmare.

I won't give out spoilers. I don't usually hand out five-star ratings.
But this movie... Oscar Worthy!",1465430400,,279,5.065217391304348
7962246,5,B000066CA3,"The film is not as bad as I was led to believe.  There is promise of what could have been.  Interstate pays homage to one of the earlier films in the film noir genre, Detour and is kind of a road-noir.  There is, however a bright light and a revelation to this film.  The emergence of a young face well-suited to film noir.  A very gifted actress by the name of Alexandra Ackerman, who should have a long and prosperous career in film.  As the female lead, Veronica she is alluring and seductive.  You cant take your eyes off her.  She is every guys vision of a goddess.  There is something captivating about her.  While this may not be a great film, the mere presence of this actress makes it worth watching.  I look forward to seeing other films with her in the lead.  For this reason alone, I recommend the film.",1444521600,,815,4.2894736842105265
7962247,1,B000066CA3,"This is just a terrible movie.  I bought it by mistake, when I was trying to purchase ""Interstate 60"" (which I highly recommend).  You can imagine my despair when Amazon would not let me undo the purchase, especially if you see both and see the MEGA difference in the two movies.  I can not recommend this movie to anyone.  I can recommend ""Interstate 60"" to everyone!!

7962248,4,B000066CA3,"This is not a typical thriller perhaps that's why the original review was so negative.  Its basically a roadmovie with thriller elements.  But in defense of this film it must be said that it is a really good movie.  Perhaps its shortcoming is that it starts out as a roadmovie and stays that way for the first 2/3 of its length and then gradually moves much further toward being a thriller.  Anyway, the end was really enthralling and the movie builds up enough suspense, but as mentioned it takes its time in doing so and is at times far more of a psychological thriller between 2 girls and a guy who take an adventurous trip across the interstate highways.
What I really like about the DVD was the somewhat fresh approach toward producing a thriller by combining 2 genrers - the roadmovie and thriller ones.

Summary: This is for all roadmovie and (psychological) thriller fans.",1267315200,,880,4.651612903225806
7962249,1,B000066CA3,"According to the cover, this film is supposed to be a thriller, but there was nothing thrilling about it. The cover also has a quote that the lead actor is like a ""young Joaquin Phoenix"". I thought this meant that his acting ability was similar to Joaquin's, but the only similarity I could see was his grimace during the entire movie (like he just smelled something foul).
The plot was flimsy, the characters were boring, & the movie ended abruptly. When the credits began rolling, I just sat there wishing I had spent the $4.00 rental fee on a gallon of gas instead.
I love to find great low-budget indies -- this wasn't a great find.",1212019200,2,636,4.491379310344827
