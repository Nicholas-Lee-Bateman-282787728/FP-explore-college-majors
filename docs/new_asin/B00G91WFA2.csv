8621396,3,B00G91WFA2,"Interesting curiosity from early in Luchino Visconti's career -a neo-realismo version of James Cain's Postman Always Rings Twice.
Earthier and more convincingly realistic (shot outdoors, on location) than the glossy M-G-M Lana Turner film, story meanders after the initial, steamy encounter. The two leads, however, really look like people instead of movie stars, and the rural farmhouse setting is charming in a seedy way. Not exactly Italian Noir, but a pre-cursor (1943) of what to be developed in Hollywood. Compare it to the poetic-realism of France, in the same period, however, and it barely holds its own. Curiously, though Italy was in the midst of a world war, there is no reference to this.",1436400000,,701,5.157894736842105
