8406731,5,B003VE9WT2,"Another great character piece from Victor Nunez. Not as good as Ulees Gold or Coastlines but the same story theme which seems to be a trademark in his films of a major character that returns ""home"" to try and build a new life but is in reality escaping from it. Just like those films, in this story everything comes full circle and ends up the way it's supposed to be, our main characters the better off for it thru the learning experience. Highly recommend, the acting as usual is great.",1344902400,,488,4.433333333333334

8406734,5,B003VE9WT2,"Having received a thumbs up from Roger Ebert and a NY Times Critic's pick of the week, SPOKEN WORD, will make you want to go home this Thanksgiving and speak to your family.  Director, Victor Nunez, proves again he can elicit Oscar worthy performances.  Ruben Blades's performance as Senior deserves such kudos.  This bitter sweet drama speaks volumes of truth about the power of communication from the heart -- also know as poetry.",1286668800,4,432,4.890410958904109
