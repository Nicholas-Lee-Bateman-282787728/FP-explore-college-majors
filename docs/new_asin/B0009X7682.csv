2334030,4,B0009X7682,"A wealthy kleptomaniac(Gene Tierney) falls under the spell of a slick, debonair astrologer/hypnotist/gigolo (Jose Ferrer) and winds up accused of murder. Her psychoanalyst husband (Richard Conte) battles to figure it out. 20th Century Fox gave this film first class treatment and it shows. With Otto Preminger directing from a Ben Hecht script and Tierney's clothes designed by then husband Oleg Cassini, this noir drama has a certain high gloss look. And the DVD print is near flawless with the b&w contrasts very sharp. Tierney is lovely and properly distressed but Ferrer is fantastic as Korvo the hypnotist. Watching his performance is an acting course unto itself. Worth watching for film buffs and noir fans. Kudos to Fox for bringing these forgotten films their due.",1126051200,4,773,5.241935483870968
2334031,4,B0009X7682,"If you've never seen Otto Preminger's ""Whirlpool"" you'd be well advised to avoid reading anyone's plot synopsis.  Like Preminger's ""Laura,"" the script takes some turns you will probably not anticipate.

Though it isn't quite ""noir"" in the gumshoe sense, it plays on important themes of the genre, notably strong independent women falling prey to parasitic men (as in ""Mildred Pierce,"" ""Born To Kill"", and of course ""Laura"").

Jose Ferrer is easily the worst of all the ""male fatales""--it's an amazing performance.  And Tierney again typifies the restless postwar gal--the strong glamour girl relegated to bored housewife, which is always a recipe for disaster.

The black & white DVD transfer is luminous--as it should be, since this movie is almost never played anywhere, and has never been on video before. There's also a commentary by Richard Schickel (havent heard it yet, but lets hope it's better than the dreadful commentary Fox put on ""Leave Her To Heaven"").",1125878400,5,966,5.166666666666667

Hypnosis did have some 'bad guys' during that era, and Jose Ferrer is the baddest of them all! What a sleaze, he played his part perfectly.

Loved Gene Tierney's portrayal of the mixed up and mesmerized doctor's wife, she also played it to perfection.

I'm taking off 1 star as I did think this was one of Richard Conte's less than stellar performances. He seemed to be sleep-walking (no pun intended) through this film, with very little emotion shown.

2334047,3,B0009X7682,"I'm a Richard Conte fan, and someone who employs hypnosis, so this should have been just my cup of tea.  I found it only mildly interesting.  It's deemed film noir (not sure why) but I thought it lacked the finesse and style of other examples of the genre, most notably, two of Preminger's- Where the Sidewalk Ends and Fallen Angel, two favorites I think marvelous, so I was very surprised.  At first this suggested to me that maybe Preminger was only as good as the script, but actually the premise and plot were quite good, and that doesn't explain the insipid camera work, the lack-lustre lighting- the all-round sub-par execution.

Richard Conte, normally intense and charismatic, hadn't nearly enough to do, didn't command the screen as he normally does, nor did Tierney.  In fact, everyone seemed oddly depressed (perhaps Preminger himself was depressed).  By far the best performance was Jose Ferrer's.

Even the hypnosis sessions and the Freudian analysis of Tierney's neurosis weren't enough to sustain my interest.  The hypnosis scenes should have been mysterious and suspenseful, and the end could have been ultra-dramatic, a real missed opportunity.  And [SPOILER ALERT], why on earth would Ferrer have Tierney secrete the incriminating recording in the murdered woman's house, AND, why wouldn't the police have found it?  A better ending might have been Bickford's detective orchestrating the nurse's comments about the police being hot on the heels of the recording, Columbo-like, and then trailing Ferrer to its hiding place, perhaps with Conte and Tierney already there, recovering her lost memories and each other, oblivious to their imminent, heart-in-your-mouth peril (""Get OUT of there..!"")

I give Whirlpool 2  stars, perhaps OK for a rainy day when you can't find anything else to do.

2334050,3,B0009X7682,"Whirlpool is yet another film in this Fox Noir series whose principal assets are visual -- this this case, fine black and white photography, designed sets that are gorgeously moody, and Gene Tierney dressed by Oleg Cassini. And at least in the beginning the plot unfolds with wonderful uncertainty: A rich psychoanalyst's wife (Tierney) shoplifts an item from an exclusive store, but a seemingly innocent bystander (Jose Ferrer) who also is well-known for dabbling in the mind negotiates a settlement on the spot that saves her reputation. Later, convincing her that she has fundamental psychological problems, Ferrer becomes her secret therapist, except that the therapy disguises an insidious and deadly strategy of hypnotic manipulation. When the plan reaches its climax, Tierney is the prime suspect in a murder. As I said, in the beginning we don't know what Ferrer's real plans are, and so when at lunch he gathers up Tierney's scarf and a wine glass she has touched, we don't know yet that he plans to turn those items into incriminating pieces of evidence against Tierney. However, it's at this point that the films story line devolves into specious theories, far-fetched events and contrived coincidences, and everything ends just too conveniently. Ferrer is excellent as the wicked Korvo, and Richard Conte delivers a solid, earnest performance as Tierney's husband. Tierney hereself, though, seems to sleepwalk through most of the picture, punctuating her somnambulance with occasional fits of yelling. Along for the ride in the second half is Charles Bickford, turning in his usual skilled performance in a supporting role as the principal investigating detective, whose opinion, in my opinion, is too easily swayed in the end. And in the end, I view this mainly as eye candy for 40s black and white devotees -- which I have to admit describes me -- and so I'm going to be kind and give this three stars instead of the two that it arguably deserves.",1358985600,2,1961,5.074303405572755
2334051,4,B0009X7682,"It is tough, tough indeed for a smooth, suave, sophisticated if shady guy to make his way in this wicked old world. Just ask David Korvo (played by Jose Ferrer). All he wanted was to fleece some rich dames of their ill-gotten goods, have a Mayfair swells good time, and then move on.  And helping him to do this was a line of pitter-patter, some wit and, if he needed to use the heavy ammunition, a little hypnosis. All in a day's work, and no heavy lifting. But things got sticky; one of those rich dames he fleeced decided that she was going to tell all once she and he had run through her daughter's legacy.

And that is really where this story begins because no way, no way in hell is smooth operator (although filled with all kinds of class resentments not all of them bad) David is taking the fall. And that is where the sins of the rich and famous, the ones that are swept under the rug at any cost are forced to see the light of day. See David has already picked out his fall-girl, the rich but very insecure Mrs. Sutton (played by Gene Tierney) who has a secret; she steals stuff, stuff from department stores and the like. Our David uses that against her, along with a little hypnosis, to frame her, frame her big time for the murder of that ""born again"" spendthrift rich woman who decided to spill the beans.

But you know one thing, no, two things once you read the line-up of the cast. No way, no way in hell is good girl (if misunderstood, misunderstood by shrink hubby played by Richard Conte most of all) Gene Tierney is going to take the fall for murder. And two, the set up here is a classic case of crime doesn't pay that drives all these cinematic crime noir and so David, maybe just a tad bit smarter than your average crook, and certainly more resourceful is doomed by his own greed. Dialogue by Ben Hecht helps move this one along. But women, rich women with little back room secrets, beware of Svengalis okay.",1345248000,,1933,4.319559228650138
2334052,4,B0009X7682,"In the 1940's, Otto Preminger directed three notable examples of film noir.

WHIRLPOOL, 1949, was written by Ben Hecht (under the blacklist pseudonym Lester Barstow) and Andrew Solt, adapted from Guy Endore's novel. The film Stars Gene Tierney, Richard Conte, Jos Ferrer, and Charles Bickford. Tierney, the wife of a successful psychoanalyst (Richard Conte), is arrested for shoplifting. She is saved from scandal by smooth-talking hypnotist, Jos Ferrer.  Ferrer, however, is not what he appears and Tierney soon finds herself involved in blackmail and murder. Although Preminger was smart enough to bring along the enchanting Gene Tierney and the talented Ben Hecht, the plot is pretty ridiculous and full of implausible twists. Although this is an enjoyable film, it pales in comparison to LAURA.",1326153600,,1157,6.310126582278481

2334054,3,B0009X7682,"Whirlpool dabbles in Freudian psychology and hypnosis that were reminiscent of the times, but almost to a fault. The film involves a quack of a psychologist, Dr. Korvo, coming to the aid Ann Sutton, who has stolen an item from a department store. Korvo saves Sutton from public shame by discussing the matter with the store's owner and talking them out of pressing charges (it also helps that Sutton is wife of a prominent psychoanalyst). Feeling indebted to Korvo, Ann Sutton begins a covert relationship with him; several meetings take place with him prying into her problems of insomnia as well as her compulsion to steal. Under his guise of helping the poor, forgotten and neglected wife, his true intentions come into view later. Clearly bait for the scheming Korvo, Ann Sutton is unaware that the scheming man is using her for his own devious agenda. Korvo's slick and slimy personality is ably played by Jose Ferrer, as we see him use knowledge of hypnosis to get into Ann's conscience. When a murder takes place, the police have a clear path to the suspect, but what appears to be an open and closed case is a bit more complicated.

I usually love noir films, but Whirlpool, while it has a little bit of intrigue, suffers from mediocrity due to an improbable plot, plodding pace and less-than-memorable performaces. There are points in the story where we literally have to believe the most far-fetched of events, such as a doctor hypnotizing himself. The actors were marginal in their roles, but nothing really to stand out or remember. Gene Tierney, for comparison, was fantastic in many of her other roles (Dragonwyck, Laura, Leave Her to Heaven, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), but seems to be sleepwalking a bit here. Still, the film's premise was quite unique and kept me entertained, and there is enough mystery to keep you engaged to wait for the conclusion.

Whirlpool is a sleek thriller about the well-to-do. Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), the fashionable, neurotic wife of a prominent psychoanalyst, is kleptomaniac --- When she is arrested at an upscale department store for stealing a broach, she is save by Korvo (Jos Ferrer), an astrologer and hypnotist who specializes in separating gullible rich women from their money.

An interesting film that is well worth watching --- Jose Ferrer as Korvo is a standout but Gene Tierney seems to have lost her fire and ends up sleepwalking through the film, even when she is not hypnotized.

The shot in which Gene Tierney stands before the portrait is an obvious homage to Laura and a rare moment of self-quotation in Preminger's oeuvre. David Raksin's theme song, good but not great evokes the heroine's descent into a vortex.

2334057,1,B0009X7682,"Advertised in the 1949 trailer as the next great drama since Gene Tierney's appearance in the movie Laura (1945) it plainly is not. It is an Otto Preminger exploitation attempt on Gene Tierney's and his own directing fame from Laura made 5 years earlier.

The movie has a story deep enough for a 30 minute Hitchcock type murder matinee that bores when stretched to 97 minutes. I am afraid this is another film advertised as Noir that is not. Even with known good actors the program bores. Classic B movie cop scene where she walks into a room and touches a dead body then police jump out of an adjacent room to arrest her though no proof of murder is shown. This is done on what seems to be a low budget film set. None of the sets live up the beauty of the film Laura or any other good film though the movie is sold as a followup to Laura.

An interesting example of showing the climatic scenes without sufficient build. Scary from the prospective of hopeful filmmakers who hope to make great films since ""all the elements"" seem to be here at least in part but the film is a total bore.

As a person who loves Noir films if I can't be even partially satisfied they have really missed the genre expectations. Unfortunately this film does not reward by giving you something else. I don't believe the positive reviews. They must be people fascinated with Gene Tierney though she can't fix this ""party that never happens"".",1288310400,3,1418,4.467181467181467
2334058,4,B0009X7682,"""Whirlpool"" is sometimes labeled ""film noir"", but  I think that's inaccurate. It's a psychological thriller in a more conventional -and more superficial- vein. It was adapted from Guy Endore's novel ""Me Thinks the Lady"" by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt and directed by Otto Preminger, who manages to make a wacky plot sufficiently engaging. Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is an elegant, well-to-do woman married to prominent psychiatrist Dr. William Sutton (Richard  Conte). Caving into emotional exhaustion one day, she shoplifts a piece of jewelry in a department store. She's saved from embarrassment by David Korvo (Jose Ferrer), a persuasive and charming man who is a practitioner of unconventional methods of psychoanalysis, including hypnotism. He recognizes Ann's kleptomania, insomnia, and headaches and offers to treat her. But Korvo is concealing other plans for Ann.

It comes down to dueling psychoanalysts: the respectable, scrupulous Dr. Sutton versus the clever but uncredentialed and sinister Korvo. It is through Ann and Theresa Randolph (Barbara O'Neil), a former patient of Korvo's, now a patient of Sutton's, that the men fight. The women are victims, though they try mightily not to be. Gene Tierney's icy aloofness works fine in this role. She only has to adore her husband and bemoan her fate. Beyond Otto Preminger, credit for the success of this preposterous plot goes to Jose Ferrer. He conjures a slick and manipulative villain whose self-conscious wit is great fun, even if he is a thieving, murdering louse. ""Whirlpool"" isn't a great film by any means, but it's a well-crafted mid-century melodrama. It left me wondering, though, if Preminger's long takes might have been more interesting filmed by frequent collaborator Joseph LaShelle.

The DVD (Fox 2005): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min) and an audio commentary by  Richard Schickel, who discusses Preminger's ""objective"" style, his long takes, plot, characters, cast, relationships between characters, and does some scene analysis.

2334061,2,B0009X7682,"Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is married to Dr. Bill Sutton, an upright psychoanalyst (played by a completely miscast Richard Conte). When we first meet Ann, she's getting arrested by a store detective in a department store after attempting to steal an expensive piece of jewelry. Okay, so that's a bit of a twist--our heroine is a kleptomaniac. Next into the mix is the oily David Korvo (nicely and seedily played by Jose Ferrer). He knows the department store owner and convinces him to drop the charges against Ann.

Korvo is 1949's answer to a new age practitioner: he dabbles in astrology but is principally a hypnotist. At first Ann believes Korvo is trying to blackmail her but he persuades her that he really wants to be her 'therapist'. Ann is smart enough to realize that Korvo is trying to get her to come up to his hotel room so they can have sex so she meets him downstairs in the hotel lobby. Korvo gives up on the sex idea but has more sinister plans. At first, he charges $50 for hypnotism sessions which appear to be helping Ann with her insomnia.

We learn more about Korvo from one of Bill Sutton's patients, Theresa Randolph, who tries to warn Ann that Korvo is a blackmailer and up to no good but Ann believes that Theresa is merely jealous of her relationship with this extremely crafty Svengali (apparently Bill adheres to a strict code of doctor-patient confidentiality as Ann has never met Theresa Randolph before). Bill records his therapy sessions on new-fangled long playing records which he stores in a closet in his home. Everything about Korvo's 'modus operandi' (his penchant for blackmail and physical abuse) are detailed in these recordings and Korvo realizes that he has to get his hands on them if he is to continue in his career as a con artist.

So what does Korvo do? He murders Randolph (just as she's about to change her will negating a bequest that leaves Korvo a large amount of money as part of her estate). He also hypnotizes Ann and has her steal the Randolph therapy session recordings and puts them in a closet in Randolph's house. He sets Ann up by leaving a glass with Ann's fingerprint on it in Randolph's home. The police arrive and arrest Ann for murder.

Now it gets strange, real strange! Korvo needs an alibi. Apparently he's been having gall bladder problems so he arranges to have an operation at two in the afternoon on the day of the murder. The murder occurs at nine in the evening so how does Korvo pull it off? Well we find out (quite improbably) that Korvo hypnotized himself and was able to drag himself out of bed and commit the murder.

The hypnotist's power of suggestion has a prominent role in this film but unfortunately much too prominent. I always believed that hypnotism might be a useful tool in helping people overcome minor health or psychological problems (such as Ann being helped with her insomnia at the beginning of the film). But I didn't buy it for a minute when Korvo orders Ann around in a trance and then hypnotizes himself hours after major surgery. And then Korvo does it again--he hypnotizes himself once more so he can leave the hospital and try and get his hands on the recordings. But instead of taking the recordings and getting out of the deceased Randolph's house right away (or even destroying them at the house), he tarries and begins playing them on the phonograph in the living room. This gives the Suttons and the investigating detective enough time to arrive at the crime scene where they eventually confront Korvo, who drops dead from blood loss (apparently his hypnotic suggestions are not powerful enough to stanch the bleeding--complications from his surgery earlier that afternoon).

Aside from the obvious plot holes, there is also a distasteful conceit being peddled by the film's screenwriters here. The dubious and subjective 'profession' of psychoanalysis not only is depicted as being highly 'scientific' but is also placed on par with practitioners in the medical profession. 'Unscientific', unlicensed 'healers' (represented by the evil Korvo) are presented as bogus and manipulative in striking contrast to the upright Dr. Sutton (who uses his psychobabble) to uncover the ROOT of his wife's kleptomania. With some kind soothing words, Dr. Sutton will soon solve his wife's neurosis and they can once again move amongst their social equals and bring good cheer to them without the fear of scandal.

If you see this on DVD, there's some interesting commentary by film critic Richard Shickel. He notes that the late film critic, Pauline Kael, termed this film ""a real stinker"". But Schikel is more on the side of critic Andrew Sarris who felt there were a lot of worthwhile things about the film. While Tierney and Ferrer's performances draw you in, the plot holes and the psychobabble are enough to keep one from taking the DVD off the shelf and watching it every couple of months. I'm not sure if 'Whirlpool' deserves to be called a 'real stinker' but it's decidedly no great work of art!",1236988800,2,5000,4.780092592592593
2334062,2,B0009X7682,"Offered as part of Fox's film noir series, this 1949 drama is drawn into the inescapable spiral of noir by its psychoanalytic themes and hypnosis-based plot device. In its visuals, dialog, pacing and mood, however, it rarely delivers on the bleakness, inevitability or hardness of classic noir. The story of a troubled woman controlled by an unethical charlatan has potential, but the script (by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt) is surprising only in its dullness and ridiculous plotting. The story is developed slowly and much of the dialog is delivered lethargically rather than with actual dramatics. In contrast David Raskin's musical score is overbearing with its flourishes, attempting to create tension where the film itself cannot. Gene Tierney's lead performance is hammy and often overwrought, and though Jose Ferrer's murderous quack rises to a sweat-soaked evilness, he's undone by the script's poorly wrought psychobabble, unbelievable police procedure and illogical plotting.

2334063,2,B0009X7682,"This to me was lacking, it just wasn't a magical atmospheric film noir like the others Fox has released.
It didn't quick click despite the cast. Gene Tierney had a very bad haircut,and this time around she wasn't good in the acting department. Richard Conte didn't seem convincing to me as a psychotherapist and Jose Ferrer had a sleazy role but hypnotizing himself while he was sick so he could commit murder was a stretch for me. It is a murder mystery of sorts, but it is just lacking - it just didn't have the power films like Laura and I wake up screaming had  Whirlpool really did not come across as a classic Noir..its not the worst but certainly not a great one either. Gene wasn't very good to look at and the movie wasn't very good to watch. See Laura instead.",1231632000,,770,4.384615384615385
2334064,2,B0009X7682,"This isn't a great film. Part of the problem lies with the character assigned to Gene Tierney. The character she plays comes across more as distraught and hysterical than anything else. It's hard to imagine that anyone, regardless of how much they loved her, could believe in her. To make matters worse some of the dialogue she delivers is awful. There isn't an actor dead or alive who could make a character like that fully believable. But part of the fault lies with Tierney herself. She spends most of her screen time looking like she's in a trance, even when she's not supposed to be in one. Many of her most emotional moments are overwrought. And there are times when she doesn't seem as involved as she should be. There are some flashes of brilliance but her work here is inconsistent.

The rest of the members of the cast fare better. Richard Conte turns in a fine performance. There's never a moment when his concern or sincerity is in doubt. His character exudes confidence but allows his vulnerability show at the same time. Charles Bickford is in fine form as the cynical and weary cop who can't ignore the improbable regardless of what his training dictates. Both play off of each other and the other characters in the film well. Barbara O'Neil brings style to the role of the woman who tries to warn Tierney about the character played by (Jose) Ferrer. But it's Jose Ferrer who gives the performance that steals the spotlight. In the scenes he shares with (Gene) Tierney he plays off her in such as way as to carry them both. His moments with Richard Conte and Charles Bickford belong to him as well. Their animosity toward him becomes palpable because he passes those feelings directly to the viewer. He ends up as one of those characters that has to be hated even though his performance is loved.

The technical work on the film is strong as well. The cinematography by Arthur C. Miller is excellent. The narrative flow from scene to scene is good. Many of the shots are brilliantly atmospheric. The sets are lavish but uncluttered and done in good taste. And there are none of the fashion blunders that plague the film 'Laura'. The outfits shown in this film are sharp and tasteful. The lighting (as is often the case with the 'Fox noir' films) is often stunning. The restoration and transfer to DVD is exemplary so it looks as good as it can look.

Unfortunately, the Direction, by Otto Preminger, is erratic. His pacing, as usual, is sharp. His placement of characters and props is solid as well. But, he has to share some of the blame for the way (Gene) Tierney's character fails. There were limits to what he could do to shape the character, that's true. It would have taken an extensive re-write to make the character more believable. But he could have pressed for more restraint when the woman was at her most overwrought. He didn't and he should have.

As a film, 'Whirlpool', has a lot going for it. The plot is an intriguing one. The story-line, which was based on a novel by Guy Endore and adapted by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt, takes some turns that are impossible to be prepared for. It's hard to say whether all the things that take place are medically possible or not but, who cares? That's Hollywood. Viable or not the improbable premise makes for an engaging and unpredictable yarn. Many of the people, both in front of and behind the camera, were among the 'crme de la crme' of the industry at that time. Preminger did know how to pace a story, even a weak one. Gene Tierney never failed to light up a screen, even when she wasn't at her best. And the cast and crew involved in this didn't fail to make this entertaining and good to look at.

It's no 'Laura' but it does look good. And it's fun to watch.",1220745600,2,3736,4.528888888888889

Of course, Gene Tierney is pretty easy on the eyes, but the film is not really noir, more of a psychological thriller. Not a good place to start if your just getting into classic film noir, but a fine little film nevertheless.

Silver and Ward's encyclopedic ""Film Noir"" does not list it, though it does mention other releases by the lading cast members.  No matter, W can stand on its' own merits. As the story opens, Gene Tierney is pinched for shoplifting by the house dick at a fancy department store in LA.  Quickly, perhaps a bit conveniently, GT is sprung by a smooth talking Jose Ferrer.  It develops that GT is a very vulnerable young woman.  Among her problems is kleptomania and JF is quick to exploit.  He hypnotizes GT under the guise of ""helping her sleep at night"" but he has far darker motives. It seems he has bilked Barbara O'Neill out of $60Gs and O'N wants her $$ back.  Soon she is found murdered-with GT at the crime scene! As many of previous reviews have revealed the resolution, this one will try to maintain an air of mystery.  Will justice be done?  Is GT on her way to the electric chair? Her lawyer is planning an insanity defense! What happens? My amazon friends will have to watch for themselves, but what develops is a very solid murder mystery with many more angles than mentioned here.  This reviewer believes that the males carry W. Richard Conte is GT's supportive husband, capably shedding his customary tough guy role. (He is a shrink with a penchant for taping his sessions!) Charles Bickford is perfect as the gruff but patient veteran homicide detective.  And Ferrer is over the top as an effete oily, smug villain with an airtight alibi. (Wasn't he flat on his back in a hospital bed the night O'N met her demise?) One wonders why he didn't play the black hat more often.  With all the references to hypnosis and kleptomania W is an easy movie to over analyze. Amazoners are urged to resist this temptation and simply enjoy W on its' own terms. Watch attentively.

2334070,3,B0009X7682,"Jose Ferrer proved he had a strong acting presence and reached his peak in his virtuoso role in ""Cyrano de Bergerac.""  In ""Whirlpool"" he is cast in a role that stretches his talents.

Ferrer can display a modicum of style mixed with a strong measure of authority when he is so disposed.  Ultimately he emerges as a satanic Svengali hell bent on destroying beautiful Gene Tierney.

Tierney, for her part, is cast as a vulnerable woman who is seen as ripe pickings by the opportunistic Ferrer.  After all, she is the wife of a prominent psychiatrist, played by Richard Conte in a shift from more traditionally machismo roles, and has plenty of money.

Otto Preminger, the director who specialized in films dealing with the ""moral ambiguity"" of America in the mid-century period, was just the person to develop such a conflict on screen in this 1949 release.

It was only natural for veteran scenarist Ben Hecht to write the screenplay, working with Andrew Solt.  After all, it was Hecht who gave us such psychological thrillers working with Alfred Hitchcock as ""Spellbound"" and ""Notorious.""

The film begins with Ferrer helping Tierney out of a jam.  Even though she lives an affluent life with her highly successful husband, Tierney is a kleptomaniac.  When she attempts to steal a brooch from a department store the store's detective is there to apprehend her before she has a chance to drive away.

Ferrer comes to the rescue of Tierney.  The store manager knows him well and immediately seeks to bring an unfortunate matter to a close.  His conduct tips off viewers early that Ferrer is the type of individual who can and will cause trouble if and when he feels so disposed and has a formidable reputation.

It takes Ferrer little time to adopt his Svengali manner and seek to dominate Tierney, who in turn resists.  Before long circumstances develop under Ferrer's unscrupulous planning that she is charged with a murder.

To give away more would interfere with the suspense plotting, but it can be said without giving away critical facts that Ferrer is a man who plays by the ""take no prisoners"" rules.  Opportunism and domination are his twin hallmarks.

Just as we have an ongoing conflict in the relationship between Ferrer and Tierney, we have a corresponding cooperative alliance that emerges between Tierney's husband Conte and police-investigating detective Charles Bickford.

When Bickford sees that Conte is a loyal husband convinced that the woman he loves is innocent, Bickford confides that his wife died recently, generating empathy between the two men as he begins to increasingly believe that Tierney is an innocent victim.

Bickford, as a shrewd and veteran police officer, realizes that he can benefit from Conte's professional expertise from his background as a world famous psychiatrist.  Conte's knowledge of the effects of hypnosis proves highly beneficial in helping solve the case.

Bickford at a critical juncture treats Conte more like an investigative partner rather than the husband of the official prime suspect of the moment and his strategy ploy brings results when a Conte strategy ploy results with Ferrer figuratively ""hanging himself on his own petard.""",1170892800,5,3191,5.047709923664122
2334071,5,B0009X7682,"This is a marvelous film noir story set in every day upper-middle-class America.  It presents the popular ambivalence felt at the time about psychoanalysis, with one ""good"" Doctor and one charlatan.

I am a fan of Gene Tierney, without thinking she a great actress. She was exceptionally pretty, had a very polished manner, and very average in range.  This made her a wonderful representative of both the middle class, and their hopes of being refined.  To my mind, while this is not her best film (That being either THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR or LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN), this IS her finest acting work.  It uses her blankness to advantage, and this script also gives her the pathos and confusion to vent full emotional range which is rare for her films.  (To the observant person, it also displays the flaws of her presentational acting style; as when she breaks down in a torrent of bitter tears, and looks up afterwards - dry eyed and serene.  But for THIS film - playing a woman completely divorced from her own emotions - even that works to the benefit of the plot.)

An actor is always helped - made better, challenged more - by working with other great actors, and she is working here with one of the very best, Jose Ferrer.  This was shortly before his academy award win in CYRANNO, and quite possibly, this incredibly complex performance contributed to that win, he is simply excellent.  All screen villains should watch this, every second of his performance is filled with a gamut of emotions, and mundane details.  It is clear that not only is his character the smartest person in the room, but Ferrer may be as well.  Tierney carries the story and Ferrer moves it along.  Charles Bickford also gives a marvelous performance in a smaller, yet layered role as the rumpled, grieving Detective.

Richard Conte, is the real oddball casting.  His street-tough demeanor is what carried his career.  (He is magnificent as the psycho mob boss in stylish expressionistic noir film, THE BIG COMBO.)  So it was an interesting choice to cast him as the intellectual top-notch psychologist, and ideal husband, but it doesn't really work.  We just can't really believe that people would turn to him for help, that level of sensitivity isn't there.  Ultimately, this is an undercurrent of the movie, however, and Director Otto Preminger may have been making the point that even a good Psychiatrist may not be that good for people.

This film was probably shocking in its day - not very nice - like watching those lovely people next door have a drunken brawl.  A larger theme which is being exposed here is that the ""perfect post-war life"" is an empty faade.  Since this was made in 1949, this film presents a very early warning shot across the bow of the ""Cleaver Family"" faade.  It would be almost 10 years before this was a much more common thread, in such movies as the Kim Novak/Kirk Douglas ""STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET,"" and then films with James Dean, who became the poster boy of idyllic family life with a dysfunctional core.

The talented Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay with Andrew Solt, based on a novel by Guy Endore.  Much more than mystery, much more than noir, this is a very fine story with good plot twists, emotional life (which is usually absent or ice-cold in noir), developed with subtlety and brains.  It is still a joy to watch for itself, but made timeless by the despicable, love-to-hate-him performance of Jose Ferrer.",1153699200,16,3429,4.721008403361345

Joe Ferrer's hypnosis of Gene Tierney to allow her to sleep is nothing compared to the yawns brought about by the agonizingly slow pace, lack of action, and interminable pauses between lines. At one point, Gene Tierney swears that she hasn't been lying, and you find yourself wanting to respond: ""Of course, you haven't. You haven't said anything of import.""

up the perfect crime so what does he do? He returns to the scene for no apparent reason other than to be captured. He hypnotizes Gene Tierney to steal incriminating evidence and then has her place the items where they will inexorably be discovered.

It is an unusual film noir from Otto Preminger and his favorite leading lady, Gene Tierney, who had starred in his classic ""Laura"" and whom had just completed her maternity leave when production began on ""Whirlpool"".

Tierney gives a fascinating performance as Ann Sutton, the beautiful wife of a prominent psychiatrist (Richard Conte) who suffers from kleptomania but who will do anything to conceal this. When hypnotist David Korvo (Jose Ferrer, very menacing here), gets her out of a jam with the local authorities due to her shoplifting tendencies, he decides to use it as a form of blackmail against her in order to use his hypnotizing skills on her. He gets her to perform all kinds of shady deeds, while succeeding in getting her conscious mind to suppress it. She is strangely drawn to him, while her dumbfounded husband can come to only one conclusion - that she and Korvo are involved in an illicit affair. Ann desperately tries to prove her innocence, and in the process, leads all involved in a potentially deadly trap to stop Korvo.

There are echoes of ""Laura"" throughout, including the portrait that hangs over the mantle at the home of the ill-fated Theresa Randolph (Barbara O'Neill, best remembered as Scarlett's mother in GWTW), and the final shootout. Definitely an off-beat movie of the noir genre, it is still a very watchable one.

2334079,4,B0009X7682,"Believe it or not, Whirlpool (1949) is my very first Otto Preminger film, probably because I spend a great deal of time rummaging around in the cinematic `bargain bin', meaning many of the movies I watch (almost exclusively on DVD) tend not to be of the highest caliber...that's not to say I don't enjoy wonderful films like this, but I may not review them as often as I should...anyway, based on a novel by Guy Endore titled ""Methinks The Lady"", and directed by Otto Preminger (Laura, The Man with the Golden Arm, Porgy and Bess), the film stars the very lovely Gene Tierney (Laura, Leave Her to Heaven, The Razor's Edge), Richard Conte (Call Northside 777, The Blue Gardenia, Ocean's Eleven), and Jos Ferrer (Cyrano de Bergerac, Moulin Rouge), whom I'm thankful to see in a decent, if not excellent role, given the last two films I saw him in, Dracula's Dog (1978) and Bloody Birthday (1981), were hardly vehicles that showcased his true talents, but I suppose in Hollywood, to maintain a sense of longevity in terms of an acting career, you take what you can get...also appearing is Charles Bickford (Brute Force, A Star Is Born) and Barbara O'Neil (Gone with the Wind, I Remember Mama).

As the film begins we see an attractive woman (Tierney) leaving a department store (stores have valet parking?  I gotta get out more...), soon to be accosted by the store detective, as she's caught stealing an expensive trinket.  As she's hauled back in, protesting all the way, a man named David Korvo (Ferrer) recognizes the woman, and comes to her aide.  Turns out she's Ann Sutton, wife to a prominent and affluent psychoanalyst named Dr. William Sutton (Conte).  The management, seeing the possibility of negative publicity for the store, releases Ann (must be nice...if this happened to me I'd probably be enjoying the comforts of a 6 by 9 concrete room with burly man named Bubba), but thus begins her relationship with Korvo, an oily, opportunistic, highly intelligent and perceptive con artist who passes himself off as a doctor of sort, his specialty being astrology and hypnosis.  Given this recent event, you'd think it a prime opportunity for blackmail, but Korvo expresses interest in helping Ann with her issues, which include a persistent case of insomnia.  Ann secretly takes Korvo up on his offer mainly due to the fact her husband doesn't know about her condition, as she's afraid of the adverse effects her problems may have on her husband's career (and their marriage) if word ever got out, but Korvo's machinations prove a slippery slope marked with lies, deceit, and even murder.

There were two stand out performances here for me, that of Gene Tierney, sporting a very short hairdo (she looks so much better with it long), and Jos Ferrer, whose credentials I began to question lately due to some of his later choices in film roles.  Tierney does a great job filling out her character, one full of emotion, passion, fear, love, and confusion.  She's a strong, beautiful, and intelligent woman, struggling with her supposed role in life, specifically the perceptions of what she's supposed to be, and what she would like to be...the psychological conflict is purposely buried, but ends up manifesting itself in strange behavior.  Ferrer's character, picks up on this enough so to work himself around it, insinuating himself into Ann's life, and setting in motion a carefully crafted, highly devious plan designed to misdirect, confuse, and obfuscate the truth.  Oh how I hated him (his character, that is)...he was so manipulative, smug and pretentious...and greasy...oh, not physically, but on the inside.  Some of my favorite lines in the film occur at the afternoon society party thrown for Korvo, as he makes various cloaked, verbal jabs at his host...was she deserving?  Probably so, but once you get a full realization of from who the remarks are coming from, it tends to feel much like the pot calling the kettle black, except for the fact the kettle is really only gray and the pot is completely charred.  Does that make sense?  Probably not...the really interesting thing about this movie is I doubt any of the characters here are people I'd want to spend time with...a thief who has clandestine meetings with another man and keeps past indiscretions from her spouse, her knuckleheaded husband who sees his wife as more of a trophy rather than an individual, despite obvious signs the role is not a good fit for her, and a top notch con man willing to do anything to protect himself from trouble.  As far as the rest of the performances, some were good, albeit familiar (Bickford), while others seemed acceptable (Conte).  As intelligent as Conte's character was supposed to be, he seemed always a few steps (at least) behind what was actually going on...I guess the difficulty I had here was not with the performer, but more so the character, as he presented these perfectly simplistic notions with regards to his relationship with his wife (along with some associated lines of dialog), unable to sense the turmoil developing within, especially given his profession.  Was it a case of not seeing the forest for the trees?  No, it was more like not seeing the forest or the trees...I found it hard to buy off that Conte's character could be as noted and respected as he was within his profession, yet so dense when it came to his own wife.  Despite this gripe, the overall story is solid, interesting and filmed immaculately well, and the dialog strong and supportive and in tune of the differing characters and the performers playing them.  The story does feature some fantastical elements to be sure, but there's a level of complexity within the material that can actually support the burden, and create a sense of plausibility, for myself, at least...

The picture on this DVD, presented in the original aspect ration (1.33:1), looks exceptionally clean and sharp, and the audio comes through excellent, available in both Dolby Digital stereo and Dolby Digital mono.  Special features include a commentary track with film critic Richard Schickel, a theatrical trailer, and trailers for other Fox noir DVD releases like Call Northside 777 (1948), The Dark Corner (1946), House of Bamboo (1955), Laura (1944), Nightmare Alley (), Panic in the Streets (1947), and The Street with No Name (1948).

2) Jose Ferrer, who is so casually suave and interesting and funny and assured, he not only belongs in a different movie but in a different reality.  His charlatan, Korvo, should've wound up in a film by William Friedkin or James Toback.  He looks a little like the actor Tim Blake Nelson and his physical appearance is so antithetical to the character he plays -- a mink-smooth, mesmerizing con artist -- that at first I was disappointed and I wondered if he could pull it off. ""Is *that* the bad guy?"" I thought, when he first appeared onscreen.  Almost immediately -- during the department store debate -- he proved he was and then immediately transcended an otherwise forgettable picture.

The movie itself is semi-noir hogwash -- psychoanalysis from the perspective of 1949 but what we're really talking here is a Preminger sermon on the sanctity of marriage and the trouble girls can get into when they misbehave.  Only when it speaks so frankly it actually trumps the sordid subtext (with exchanges such as, ""He helped me sleep!"" ""How?  By making love to you?"") does it extend past its pulpy plot.",1127347200,9,1173,4.7772277227722775

The story starts in an upscale department store where Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), the wife a successful psychiatrist named Dr. William Sutton (Richard Conte), is caught shoplifting.  A total stranger named David Korvo (Jose Ferrer) intercedes on her behalf and convinces the store management to let her buy the item and drop any criminal charges.  But as it turns out, Korvo's successful rescue has strings attached.  Initially, it appears that Korvo wants to blackmail Ann but instead Korvo reveals that he's a therapist and can help her with her apparent personal problems and its also obvious she's too ashamed to admit her problems to her husband.  Finally, Korvo uses hypnosis to help her with her existing problems, but as it turns out, he uses treachery in his practices and the therapy becomes totally manipulative.  This sets up the remainder of the movie where a murder is committed and Ann becomes the primary suspect.

It's actually a great film most of the way through.  Jos' Ferrer, as usual, gives an outstanding performance as a despicable predator of wealthy women and Gene Tierney does a fine job as his latest victim.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with Richard Conte.  His performance was mechanical and boring.  The film hinges on what can or cannot be done under hypnosis.  If you believe anything can be done while under hypnosis, then you will probably enjoy this film more than I did.  But even if you accept that premise, the ending falls apart with one of the most unimaginative climaxes I've seen in a long time.

The DVD transfer is very sharp but some tiny specs of deterioration were noticeable once in a while during the film. The sound is very good.  The only bonus is optional real-time commentary by film critic Richard Schickel.

2334082,4,B0009X7682,"There are no hard-boiled detectives or sultry femme fatales in 'Whirlpool', so if that is your (limited) idea of film noir, then perhaps you will not like this film.  The plotline about hypnotism seems taken straight out of a psychoanalysis textbook and has more to do with postwar domestic femininity than anything else.  Its very enjoyable though, especially the first time around.  Gene Tierney looks as beautiful as ever, although already showing signs of age, and gives a good performance, but this is really a showcase for the great Puerto Rican actor Jose Ferrer.  As much as I liked it, the film will not stand as many repeated viewings as ""Laura"", the sublime first teaming of Gene Tierney and Otto Preminger.  'Whirlpool' looks great on the DVD transfer and I definitively recommend watching it, especially if you enjoyed the similarly themed 'Spellbound'. I think the film should be part of the collection of any film noir, Otto Preminger or Gene Tierney fan, but others may be satisfied with a simple rental.",1126742400,5,1020,4.941520467836257

However, this noirish suspense drama does have a lot going for it: Gene Tierney is quite stunning, Richard Conte playing a respectable and caring professional and Jose Ferrer really stealing the show. Perhaps not one of Preminger's very best but very enjoyable. Still, I refuse to buy the DVD at that price.",1515283200,,376,4.8

A woman is arrested for shoplifting in a store. A man intervenes, explains she is a wealthy woman with an account at the store. It is settled without calling the police. Kleptomania? The story continues by introducing her background and society. One is a psychoanalyst who is a sharp observer and a hypnotist. There are scenes that tell more about the people and their character. In time there is a dead body, a strangled woman. The police investigation uncovers evidence that implicates the wife of that psychoanalyst. She says she remembers nothing. Is there something wrong with her? Ann tells about David Corvo.

Why did she fight with Mrs. Randolph? Ann says she was sick. How did she meet David Corvo? Dr. Sutton says Ann is protecting David Corvo, who swindled Mrs. Randolph out of a fortune intended for her daughter. The psychoanalyst talks about his patient. The police locate David Corvo, who was in the hospital for a gall bladder operation. This is an ironclad alibi. Is there something wrong? Where is the recording for Mrs. Randolph? The lawyer will plead temporary insanity for Anns defense. Corvo talks with Dr. Sutton in the hospital. Back home the police search Dr. Suttons office. There is a conflict between Ann and Bill Sutton. Ann talks about her past, and why she stole things.

The detective questions Corvo about his relationship with Ann, and Mrs. Randolph. Sutton says Ann took the missing recording. Sutton has a solution to the murder, but the detective doesnt believe it. A nurse tells Corvo about a search for a recording. At night Corvo gets out of bed and looks into a mirror! Then he leaves the hospital and drives away. Corvo listens to the recording of Mrs. Randolph speaking to Dr. Sutton. Next the police detective and the Suttons arrive at that apartment. Bill talks to Ann, can he get her to remember? But Corvo appears with a revolver in his hand! The police detective calls for an ambulance.

This story starts out slow but gets more interesting in the second half. It depends on the idea that a person can be hypnotized to perform an illegal or immoral act. Is this true or fiction? A lot or people don't have to be hypnotized to do that. This seems like a low budget production given the cast and story. The Asphalt Jungle is a better movie from 1949, after watching it you may find the novel is better.",1511654400,,2370,4.703614457831326
