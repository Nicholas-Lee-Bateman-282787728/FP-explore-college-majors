7838337,4,6303115233,"Well, Star Trek has the answer for all of you who where having high blood pressure from this question....Just Kidding.  Plot:  The Enterprise finds a planet that is full of tornadic force winds with temperatures pushing absolute zero (not you're Sunday afternoon picnic spot).  Well, interestingly, they find a structure on that planet, so Riker, Worf, and Data go down and investigate.  I love this next part.  Riker reports that there appears to a force field that is keeping the winds from pushing to the front door and that there's a revolving door in front of them.  Picard mutters, wondering, ""Revolving door?  Number One, proceed with caution.""  Well, the trio does, and they find the building to be the ""Hotel Royale"", a casino/hotel with what appear to be humans.  Well, things appear fun at first, but then the situation gets interesting.  Riker, Worf, and Data can't leave the building.  So, now they have to find out why they can't and see if there's a way to escape.

Overall, a pretty good episode.  It's really not a very serious episode (like say in ""Contagion"" or ""Pen Pals"") but it is well paced and has plenty of humor.

Gets a 4 (pushing 5) stars.",1158364800,,1167,4.712871287128713
7838338,5,6303115233,"""The Royale"" was generally well received when it originally aired during the second season.  Within a short while though fans and critics alike accused this show of being too deriative of ST:TOS's ""A Piece Of The Action"", but I prefer to see it as a tribute to that episode, a fan favorite.
As in the original series' show, here the trapped Enterprise crew members throw themselves into the roles being forced on them and the result is memorably funny.  There are ample enjoyable elements that make this episode one of my favorites: The casino set piece is one of TNG's most memorable; the compliant but condescending desk clerk; the cheesy dialogue spoken by the casino characters - particularly the bellhop and Mickey Dee; Noble Willingham is a hoot as 'Tex'; seeing Data at the crap table in the final sequence really puts the show over the top.  Also, the mathematical puzzle Picard is trying to solve in the intro and his explanation of it to Number 1 is a perfect bridging device for this episode.
Not to be taken seriously, ""The Royale"" is both an homage to Trek's earlier incarnation and a bouquet to fans of each of the series.",1037318400,,1136,4.67

7838340,3,6303115233,"Okay, it's really silly. An alien race constructed a Vegas casino because they felt bad for a lost 20th century astronaut. The away team gets trapped  inside and loses communication with the Enterprise! Can they escape?
Not  exactly a nail-biting premise.
But it's great fun. Data shoots craps like  a king, Worf growls at the room service staff and generally looks  bewildered, and Riker gleefully gets into the swing of things. Chalk this  one up under gulity-pleasure viewing, and definitely don't take it  seriously.",966470400,10,520,5.130952380952381
