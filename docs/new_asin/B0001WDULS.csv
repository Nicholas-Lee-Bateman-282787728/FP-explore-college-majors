2032619,3,B0001WDULS,"I'm never sure how to rate a movie I enjoyed in spite of itself. Witchtrap is made by the same people who brought us Witchboard and Night of the Demons, so that gives you a little notion of what to expect. Expect something closer to Witchboard in tone and execution, though be aware this is not a sequel. Seriously, the distributor wants viewers to be aware of that, it's on the box. Actually, if you've ever seen the miniseries Rose Red then you're familiar with the cast and plot. This, like Rose Red, is a variation on Shirley Jackson's The Haunting. A team of parapsychologists are hired to cleanse an old property of a warlock's ghost so that the inheritor can turn the place into a bed and breakfast. Each member of the team is going into the job with their own preconceptions and motivations, some of them conflicting. You've got the parapsychologist leading the charge who can't wait to try out her new witch trap, her husband the spirit medium, their colleague who specializes in filming ghostly phenomena (played by Linnea Quigley), two grumpy private detectives and their avaricious boss tagging along to make sure they don't destroy the property in their zeal to find ghosts, and the reluctant physical medium whose presence could endanger them all. Because the dead warlock is still on the premises and he has a plan. He also has a groundskeeper lurking about to make sure that plan goes off without a hitch. The script is actually quite competent. Sure it's derivative and the dialogue is riddled with cliches, but it's derivative and cliche-ridden in a very entertaining manner. The script to Ouija wishes it was this fun. It's the acting and special effects that are (mostly) incompetent, in the most hilarious ways. You kind of have to see it to believe it.",1440288000,,1774,4.744336569579288

* The atheist leader believes that hauntings can be scientifically explained as electrical energy emanating from human consciousness. This energy normally dissipates when we die, but is sometimes trapped in a house, hence, a ""haunting.""

There are some differences. In WITCHCRAFT, the paranormal team is accompanied by three detectives for security purposes. (Thus resulting in a higher body count.)

In WITCHTRAP most of the actors are so wooden in their delivery, it's like watching a cast of plywood boards.

The writing is also poor. Lots of chatter and padding. The characters are melodramatic. The hero detective is a Native American who's always sniping at his boss, and sneering at the paranormal investigators. The writer apparently sough to introduce some pointless bickering for the sake of ""tense drama,"" but it comes across as pointless bickering.

There's some cheap racial dialog.

The Native American's boss says, ""We're getting paid a lot for this job."" And the Native American snaps back, ""What do you mean we, white man?""

Later, the boss orders another subordinate (who's black) to get the police. The black detective refuses. The boss detective yells, ""You get going or I'll kick your black ass down those stairs!"" The black detective shouts back, ""You try that and I'll tap dance on your face like Bojangles!""

I think the writer thinks he's being anti-racist, because the subordinates of color tell off their white boss. But sometimes they're the ones initiating the bickering. Really, it's a wonder this team continues to work together.

The Native American hero detective is always complaining to everyone. He complains to his boss about his job, because it's not hard enough. HUH? Don't most people welcome easy gigs?

Linnea Quigley has a brief role as a technician. After an initial seance, she goes upstairs for a shower, and we're treated to full frontal -- and full back -- nudity. Which is obviously why she was cast.

Objects start moving and killing the various characters. Especially cool was the bullet which rose off a table and then shot itself (without use of a gun) into someone's head.

2032622,5,B0001WDULS,Movie works better then I thought it would. For the beginning credits it's all snow distortion that adjusting the tracking does nothing. But gets perfectly clear just as it shoes the dead magician in the beginning on the sidewalk in front of the house lol,1415145600,3,255,4.688888888888889
2032623,2,B0001WDULS,"This is from Kevin Tenney, who did witch board and night of the demons 3, and directed part one. Its stars Liannea Quigley,from alot of cult movies[""kown4 showing skin""}. And the funny, Hal Havins,aka ""stooge"" from notd part one, and Jim quinns, from witchboard and, does all the demon voices in night of the demons. It was made in 1988,but went straight 2 video in 89'. So far so good right? ""ehhh.."" wrong answer. Now i like 80,s cheese,but not in excess. Its about ghost hunter type people going 2 a haunted house, by the former dead resident,and now occupied by his ghost and the looney care keeper,{""hal havins""].So they go 2 rid the ghost along with personal bodyguards, aka rent a cops, so it can be safe 2 sell for the present owner, its kevin t. making a cameo. Anyway things go wrong with the house and the film. It has bad acting, bad lines, effects not 2bad but, the story isn't as good as it mite sound. Now i know why it hasn't seen a dvd release or, isn't talk about. Its not worth the hour and a half.",1326931200,,1017,4.329842931937173
2032624,5,B0001WDULS,I saw this years ago and have been looking for it to come out on DVD or Bluray. It's a great horror flick from the 80's. A bunch of want to be ghost hunters tread in to an evil ghost domain and the blood starts flying! If you love 80's horror flix you will love this movie!!!,1275004800,3,275,3.8421052631578947
2032625,3,B0001WDULS,"A man inherits a secluded mansion that he had intended to open as a bed-and-breakfast inn, but it turns out the mansion is haunted. He hires a paranormal specialist to investigate the mansion, but insists that the psychic investigators be accompanied by three private detectives for safety.

James Quinn plays one of the private detectives who is a skeptic about the mansion being haunted. He makes this film worth watching. He adds a comic style to an otherwise typical scary movie. Some of the acting appears to be poor, but I think, in retrospect, that they were just playing their roles too seriously in contrast to James Quinn's lighthearted skeptic role. It's as if they were just saying their lines out loud with no character or emphasis and this did detract from the movie. But the evil spirit possesses one of the psychic investigators and the deaths mount up and the survivors have to figure out how to stop it. Just a fun flick.

Despite some of the acting and poor photography in this movie, I would like to have it on DVD. The director, Kevin Tenney, and some of the actors from ""Night of the Demons"", and ""Witchboard"", appear in this film: Linnea Quigley, James Quinn and Judy Tatum. Although not one of Kevin Tenney's better movies, it was interesting to see some of the actors from his more popular films. This, in itself, would make this a nice addition to my collection of ""Witchboard"" and ""Night of the Demons"".

There is this one scene in ""Witchtrap"" when someone looks at the mansion for the first time and says something like, ""How much do you think a mansion like that costs?""  James Quinn, who's voice was used as Angela's demon voice in ""Night of the Demons"", responded mockingly in Angela's demon voice, ""Your very soul!""  I definitely recognized that voice! Hopefully Anchor Bay will bring this film to DVD someday.",1093564800,3,1842,4.725856697819315

8016860,1,B0001WDULS,"Sorry, but I completely disagree with most reviewers of this movie. I would have given it two stars if it had more than just bland acting. The plot is thin and totally predictable, with nothing interesting about it. I expected a movie like Legend of Hell House, but it pales (nay, vanishes) in comparison. Not worth seeing it, unless you can find it for free in the Web. I may keep it, if only as the first item to kick start a personal collection of extremely bad movies. I am not finicky about films, but movies like this one are a waste of cinematographic resources and viewers time.",1497830400,,586,4.435185185185185

8016865,3,B0001WDULS,"I rate the WITCHTRAP Blu Ray 3 stars based on a cross between the movie itself and the technical quality of the release.  The technical merits deserve another point though.  This is a really good transfer of a late 80's horror movie that was only ever released on VHS.  The picture quality on this transfer is very nice.  I saw the movie as a kid and remember thinking parts of it were spooky.  However, after seeing it again for the first time in about 25 years, I found it to be dull at times and not very spooky, although there are some scenes that are still very memorable.  The worst thing for me this time around was that I really saw how bad some of the acting was.  Some of it was worse than a soap opera.  There were a couple good gore effects and the main villain, played by the same scary looking guy from ""Witchboard"" (JP Lupsen, or something like that) once again does a great job.  He has a spooky look to him and he uses it to the film's advantage.  This disc also features some nice bonus features such as a making of retrospective that details the origins of the film and many aspects of making it.  This was a really good feature.  Not sure why JP was missing from it though, since he did appear on the ""Witchboard"" retrospective.  Overall, it isn't too bad and does have some nice ideas but I don't see myself watching it again anytime soon.  ""Witchboard"" which was made by the same director previous to this film is definitely the better of the two and contains some solid scares.",1493164800,2,1500,4.329749103942652
