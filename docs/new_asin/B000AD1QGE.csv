2385096,5,B000AD1QGE,"Ignore the critics; Battleship is a hugely enjoyable movie that will have you wanting for more!! When I went to see this movie I was apprehensive that it was just another Transformers film. Fortunately director Peter Berg didn't let the aliens run riot unlike some movies I could mention. He seemed to have more control and as a result there is a much better balance to this movie. The story opens with NASA sending out signals to a distant solar system where they believe the existence of a possible habitable or Goldilocks planet. (How ironic that NASA recently discovered such a planet in real life, and should really please the production team). Unfortunately five years later the Aliens from said planet decided to pay Earth a visit. It is from this point the story really takes off with some sub-plots added that for once work in the movies favor. I also liked the misinterpretation angle used in the film between Earthlings v. Aliens and the fear from both sides you would expect in such a stand off scenario. There was a big question about Taylor Kitsch's ability to play a lead role, suffice to say he held his own on this occasion. The only disappointment is that there should have been a better rapport between Liam Neeson's character and Kitsch's. I felt Neeson's role as Kitsch's potential father-in-law was underused. In addition the soundtrack is extremely loud, so hopefully when shown in US cinemas the distributors will address this issue. Rihanna was also a surprise and proved she can handle action movies; fans will love her. Finally, without giving too much away its use of a very famous ship in the Finale sequence should appeal to many Americans, in fact I found the last 15 mins to be a very emotional thrill a minute ride. Don't miss it!!",1335657600,3,1764,4.73051948051948
2385097,5,B000AD1QGE,"The film starts with a NASA announcement that they are sending signals to a nearby ""Goldilocks"" planet to see if there is any life. We then switch to a bar scene where Alex (Taylor Kitsch) is ""celebrating"" his birthday with his naval officer brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgrd). He sees a young lady at the bar attempting to score a chicken burrito...which leads us to some comical events and then the opening credits.

After the credits, the film jumps some undisclosed years ahead. Alex is a full lieutenant in the navy on a ship (normally takes 8-10 years to rise that high). The girl, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) happens to be the daughter of the Fleet Admiral (Liam Neeson). They want to get married. The admiral loathes Alex because he is a gross underachiever. Everything is fun and games until...the subplots come together. At this point we can write the rest of the script. The alien ships were akin to transformers.

I must apologize, but I enjoyed the film. The inane plot continuity issues and science was Asylum grade from beginning to end. I could be here all day writing about how absurd things were.  But unlike an Asylum film, they didn't cheat us on a soundtrack which ranged from Henry Mancini to AC/DC. We had quality actors playing likable characters with some decent lines. And no one can beat WWII vets during an AC/DC music montage.

Think of the movie as ""Independence Day"" light with cheese. Good fun, good action, break out the popcorn and park your brain at the door.

No sex, no nudity, near F-bombs.",1334966400,149,1527,4.725563909774436
2385098,4,B000AD1QGE,"Good thing I was not dissuaded by the ""professional critics"" to stay far away from this movie. Sure, this is no art movie and it is not the best movie ever made but I enjoyed every minute of it, well almost every.

To me, the acid test of a good movie is how quickly time flies (during the movie) and when the movie is about to end, I'd hope it'd run another hour or two - in my book, this is one of those movies.

Yes, this movie could have been better, have fewer holes, have more ""soul"" and not so bloody loud but still it is good enough for now... till The Avengers?

Bottom line: This movie sure kept me wanting more... like Battleship II and III!

P.S. To give you an idea if you should give any weight to my ""review""... I loved Source Code, Iron Man (Iron Man II not so much), ID4, The Incredibles & The Rock. Absolutely hated Inception and True Grit. And I did not like the first 2 Transformers movies either (boring), couldn't be bothered to catch the 3rd.",1334620800,9,965,4.172043010752688
2385099,5,B000AD1QGE,"Hal Holbrook narrates the two-hour documentary that traces the history of the development and deployment of the world's Dreadnought-design battleships.

Leading off with the dramatic appearance of the Missouri and Wisconsin off the shores of Kuwait in Desert Storm, then diverting to the resting place of the USS Arizona, an old ship when she was sunk on the morning of December 7th, 1941 at Pearl Harbor, you are taken on a journey through the development and deployment of these powerful warships.

These ships were the floating seagoing equivalent of armored tanks.  The four ships of the Iowa class, the Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, were the fastest, most graceful and most powerful armored battelships the United States Navy ever put to sea.

Follow the great Battleships of the world through the years when they were the ultimate weapon of their day.  The men who served on these were their Navys' best.

They each carry a proud legacy all their own.",1256169600,2,970,4.9937888198757765

Some of the famous battleships include the North Carolina, battleships of the Iowa Class, german battleships, japanese, and others. I got interested in battleships a few years ago, and am always on the lookout for battleship videos/dvd's. This is always one of my favorites. Very informative, and filming is excellent.

This movie is true to the game to a fault, while also drifting so far away from the source material at the same time lol. Without this movie we would have never gotten Director Peter Berg's next film, Lone Survivor. The first of three films in the True American Heroes Trilogy he made with Mark Whalberg.

I didn't have to be in the Navy in a prior life to know you cant get a mothballed battleship underway in a few hours.

2385136,4,B000AD1QGE,"Very quick review here.  I really liked this movie, but some things seemed quite ""Pie"" in the ""Sky!""  Our hero's ""girlfriend""  actor Liam Neeson's daughter, plays a ""physical""  therapist.  In a scene that depicts where she works, with US Military veteran's presumably, they in fact have more than 22-veteran's of all service's doing all sorts of things on ""ultra-modern"" to ""Star-War's"" like equipment, with highly caring and ""apparently"" highly caring personnel!  If this was, in fact made to portray the US Dept. of Veteran Affairs (US DVA), well the US General Public, has in fact been very sorely misled?!?!  If it was to ""picture"" an ""ideal"" world for US Armed Service veterans' of all ""US Conflict's, it makes the US DVA look simply like a little person ""T-Ball"" league, and not even using ""wood"" or ""aluminum"" bats yet.

The closet I have seen to this, in my sad and very ""unfortunate"" 10(+) year experience was in fact the SHARE/Shepherd Center's in Atlanta Georgia!  Unfortunately, for me, due to Ex-US DVA employee had a lees than ""ideal"" experience her as well, but the fact remains, it puts the US DVA to shame by any and all ""standards!!!!""

Like this ""movie"" at SHARE, they encouraged utilizing ""leisure"" activities such as music, art, etc.. to tie in with other more serious ""therapeutic goals"" such as ""memory"" improvement, eye movement, balance, etc..... Resultant, this movie, as about US Navy, ""harkened"" me back to my day's stationed in USARK and fishing ""Prince William Sound"" in Valdez, AK, as well as made me look up ""fathom's"" in Webster's Third International Dictionary sold here on Amazon.com.  A fathom is roughly 6-feet or 1.83 meter's and the map of ""Prince William Sound"" I have goes to 11-Fathoms or 66-feet!!!  In the movie, they utilize ""water-displacement"" from US NOAA bouy's to track ""Alien"" craft....wonder if that is done in the ""real"" world, as ""scientifically"" possible given all the bouy's around the globe- and the advanced pace of IT-or ""information"" technology (9+20)!!!! (sse attached photo-presentation!!!)

Furthermore, as the ""Mighty Mo"" was about to be sunk off ""Hawaii""- it is supposedly a ""British"" pilot that save's the day, and the UK is one of the US ""staunchest"" allies- good?- ""visual"" depiction there!!!!  Kind of a ""Tandem Thrust!"" so to speak!!!!

Any-way, this was a very ""good"" and highly ""thought"" provoking movie- hopefully depicting where the US DVA needs to go- but as they say ""its a long, hard road to get there"" due to all the internal and ""ex-ternal"" factors that play into the US DVA!  Kind of like ""Catcxh-22!""",1518307200,,2581,4.981351981351981

Those ships are small but they pack a powerful punch for their size.  I found the scenes in the combat control center of the destroyer to be really interesting.,1501286400,,486,4.3076923076923075

The part near the end where the WWII veterans step up to help fight the aliens? I feel totally manipulated, but I still get a knot in my throat every time. It just doesn't add why I like this movie so much. Maybe it's all the naval protocol; maybe it's the music; maybe it's the way that battleship rains down hell on the invaders.

Lets face it, I am a guy that doesn't want to get sad for 120 mins in a drama. I don't movies to be real life ..I live it. This movie is just over the top nonsense and it is entertaining. Rihanna is in it..that to me is a selling point. John Tui on screen is a pretty likable guy..you care what happens to him. Liam Neeson didn't have to say ""where is my daughter"" for the whole movie and really I don't know if he cared. Taylor Kitsch was great in the roll..Brooklyn Decker was eye candy but she also was a Strong Woman Roll..Peter Berg..is a good director and actor..can't go wrong..If you get past the idea is board game cheese..it is a good movie..it is made to get your out of your own world into something crazy and hyped.

2385293,5,B000AD1QGE,"The battleship Missouri, a WWII era warship but now a historic site, is pressed into service by the survivors from two destroyers which had been destroyed battling alien machines from outer space.  She has the most profound mission of her career; to attack the alien mothership and disrupt a signal to outer space from a Hawaiian island based science observatory occupied by an alien ground team.  I won't spoil the end for you, but it is surely quite a thrill ride.  During the preliminary sea battles between two American and one Japanese destroyer versus alien craft able to leapfrog through the ocean and make themselves invisible to radar, homage was paid to the board game of the same name.  While invisible to radar and out of sight, the leap of an alien ship disturbs tsunami warning buoys operated by NOAA.  By referencing buoy disturbances, the commander, who is Japanese, tries to predict the area in the ocean where the alien craft will land and become vulnerable.  The missiles fired by the alien ships are reminiscent of the pegs used on the board game Battleship.  One of the most inspirational persons in the film is a real-life wounded GI, who lost his legs in war.  He is undergoing physical therapy to adapt to his new prostheses, and becomes the backbone behind leading the resistance to the aliens on the island.  Liam Neeson, the most recognizable actor in the credits, has a relatively secondary role while the aircraft carrier he is on is crippled by alien force fields.  He is able to get back into the fight at the end.",1488153600,2,1545,4.731343283582089

2385308,1,B000AD1QGE,"Alexandar Skarsgaard should be truly embarrassed about this one.  But the problem was the idiot cast as his ""brother"" with bad hair extensions. This is a movie so patently ridiculous that only the most naive and testosterone poisoned male persona could enjoy.  If it was presented as a comedy (like McHale's Navy) then fine.  But it isn't.  They really expect us to believe that a early twentysomething who did B&E to get a burrito for a girl he just met would be commanding anything other than a spatula at McDonalds.  Or that a beautiful admiral's daughter would look at him with anything other than utter contempt.  I didn't even get to the alien attack parts because it was so inane up to that point I couldn't stomach any more.  Pure trash.",1486166400,3,745,4.641221374045801

The movie box office failed to recoup the cost of production, never a good sign. he battleships look like toys on screen their main function being to lob shells and blow up.

So there's one scene where they somewhat mirror the board game, its actually a good scene.  Most of the movie though is about a handful of trapped modern Navy destroyers vs aliens.  Deck guns shooting, explosions, tactical moves, its all done in a very exciting way.  (spoiler alert) After they lose everything destroying most of the alien ships, this all leads to the final battle between the alien base ship vs the mothballed museum battleship USS Missouri with half the crew WWII and Korean War vets who know how to get the thing to move, AC/DC blaring over full broadsides coming out of the 70+ year old warship.

2385459,3,B000AD1QGE,"Battleship
 As hugely expensive blockbuster summer extravaganza movies starring Taylor Kitsch go, this one was a lot better than then the recent John Carter.  John Carter was not a successful film on any level, costing its creators about $100 million more than it garnered.  To be better than John Carter is faint praise indeed.  But Battleship isn't horrid, just not much.  The Avengers, which has now burst through the one billion dollar mark in ticket sales, is a much better movie, the mark that must be met.  It is not impossible to make a good film for $209 million but it is difficult.
 Besides Taylor Kitsch, who might have a curse to be the leading man in two huge, expensive and not very successful films in the same spring, might be an interesting young actor but he clearly cannot compel fans into the theater in the way that someone like George Clooney or Bruce Willis is able to do.  In fact, in this mega special effects fest, the cast might well be irrelevant.  We have two beautiful, staggeringly beautiful, ladies.  Brooklyn Decker (Just Go with It, What to Expect When You Are Expecting-also just out) has to be in the top one percent of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood but the script uses her as drapery.  Popular songstress (and beauty) Rihanna has more to do as an actress in this her first time out on the big screen.  She gets to shoot aliens and generally show off and has a lot more screen time than the more experienced Decker.  Liam Neeson plays the Navy admiral and father to the Decker character with a kind of embarrassed determination.
 Director Peter Berg keeps the action moving along, Ill say that.  The aliens are very good, near human in form with enough weirdness to be frightening and disgusting.  And they are lavish in their willingness to destroy as many humans as it takes.  The set up in the story is fine but a lot is lost in the telling.  There are chronological lapses that just about jarred me out of my seat.  We meet Taylor Kitsch as a slacker in his twenties who is working his way into alcoholism when he meets Brooklyn Decker, the daughter of the head of the Pacific Fleet.  In the next scene Kitsch is not just in the Navy but is several ranks up the ladder already.  This is a social impossibility (he also shows up on duty with a Miami Vice style five oclock shadow which would never work in the Navy).
 Writers Erich Hober (who penned the amusing and entertaining REDS of 2010) and Scott Stuber (most recently writer of the superb Safe House) have both done much better work.
 Still, the PG-13, two hour eleven minute splosion factory was diverting enough to rate an almost average two and a half saw blades.  There were some cool things besides the bright lights and loud noises.  Gregory D. Gadson plays a double amputee Army officer who joins the battle against the aliens.  Gadson in real life is not an actor but an Army officer who is a double amputee.  Gadson is an authentic hero with important medals and it is a tribute to director Berg that he cast Gadson in the film.  There is also a tribute to the sailors who served aboard the USS Missouri.  The Mighty Mo appears in the climax of the battle against the aliens in a heart stirring struggle which should bump up Navy enlistments.  Watch for the scene that takes us back to the childrens game of Battleship.
 Relax and enjoy the summer movies.  The popcorn is great, the theater air-conditioned and Battleship, for all its shortcomings, is a lot more fun than What Ever Happened to Virginia Wolf.",1469836800,,3526,4.556438791732909

Its definitely not a movie to be taken seriously.  It is eye candy, but I love the script.  I have read the reviews condemning the script.  Maybe these people just don't have a sense of humor.  I think the script is hilarious; and eminently quotable.  The cast is perfect.  Jesse Plemons is very funny as the dumb Boatswains Mate, Jimmy Ordy Ord (And I kept saying, This is a BAD idea.).  Rihanna looks great and is a treat to watch.  Taylor Kitsch does a great job as do, Gregory Right Now You Are Going To ACQUIRE That Courage, OR Gadson and Tadanobu Dat book is Chinese.  My way is better Asano.  I love John Tui as Chief Petty Office Walter the Beast Lynch.  Hamish Its down THERE, in that NEST of ALIENS. Linklater plays his part perfectly as the nerdy astrophysicist.

Although the movie starts off a little slowly, it is necessary to set up the main characters.  Once moving, there is plenty of fun action.  There is a lot to recommend this movie when it comes to light sci-fi viewing.  The sound track is very good IMO, too.
Battleship is also a bit of a recruiting advertisement for the U.S. Navy (but that isn't a terrible thing).

If you can maintain a bit of a sense of humor, watch it!  I think youll like it.",1524700800,,1439,4.275092936802974
