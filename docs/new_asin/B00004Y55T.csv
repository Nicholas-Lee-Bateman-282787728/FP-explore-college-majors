7926924,4,B00004Y55T,"In 1990 Jim Whittaker (first American to climb Everest, in 1963. See  ""Americans on Everest"" tape) led a large team of climbers from  the USA, China, and the former Soviet Union to climb Everest. While there  were language barriers, and medical emergencies, the team was very  successful. Viewers younger than about 30 may find the comradery shown (or  simply filmed to show) to be corney, given the long ago demise of the Cold  War. Something that the filmmakers attempted to use for narrative. But on a  historical level, this was an interesting concept ten short years ago. Of  the three Everest films produced by Pal Productions, this one is my least  favorite (Everest: North Wall, and Winds of Everest being the other two).",969062400,4,729,4.861788617886178
