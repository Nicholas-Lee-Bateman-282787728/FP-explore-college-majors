8734322,3,B015QO71B0,"Der Freischutz is considered the ""first"" modern German opera and has at least one notable section (the bullet forging scene). As a piece of drama it is terribly dated and as music its finest moments do not necessarily warrant continued listening to the whole. That said: I am pleased with the purchase as seeing in this case to understand the entire experience of the opera does more than listening on CD.",1516233600,,405,4.71830985915493
8734323,4,B015QO71B0,"Fantastic orchestral sound, could be a little more present.  I'm somewhat disappointed with the singers, they're adequate for their roles, but the voices lack conviction.  I kept straining to hear them.  And I miss a real bass for the role of Kasper.  In this production he does some dastardly deeds, but with that baby face and rather high baritone it doesn't convince.
Maestro Thielemann thrills with his direction.",1494979200,,417,5.088235294117647
8734324,4,B015QO71B0,"Thielemann is  a very commited director.  This version shows traditional scenary and video , as  well as  a  satisfactory musicianship.  Nevertheless, in Audio, it can never  overtake Kubelik s  recording  on CD  or Vinyl.  Hunting Men Chorus sounds flat ,likewise is given Second Act finale,  whose  climax seems  unforgettably thrilling under  Kubelik.  Please read  my review  to Kubelik CD.

PORTUGUS:  Thielemann   um diretor  competente. Esta  verso mostra um cenrio  e video  tradicionais, bem como uma  satisfatria  musicalidade.  Entretanto, em Audio, ela nunca poder suplantar a gravao  de Kublik, em CD  ou vinil.  O Coro dos Caadores soa fraco, como tambm o finale  do Segundo Ato, cujo  clmax  parece  inesquecivelmente  emocionante  sob Kubelik.  Favor ler  meu  comentrio sobre o CD  de
 Kubelik.
