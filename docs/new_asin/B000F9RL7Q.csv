Second on the double bill is a ""Gunfire"" (1950) (59 min. B/W)....under director/producer William A. Berke, screenplay by Victor West, musical score by Albert Glasser ....the cast includes Don 'Red' Barry (Frank James and Bat Fenton), Robert Lowery (Sheriff John Kelly), Pamela Blake (Cynthy), Wally Vernon (Clem, Cynthy's Uncle), Claude Stroud (Jim Mundy, outlaw), Leonard Penn (Dan Simons, saloon owner), Steve Pendleton (Charlie Ford (as Gaylord Pendleton), Tommy Farrell (Lerner, Money-Wagon Driver), Dean Riesner (Outlaw Mack), Paul Jordan (Johnny James), Steve Conti (Matt Riley, outlaw), Roger Anderson (Bob Ford),

Gilbert Fallman (Bank President),William Bailey (2nd Sheriff),Barbara Woodell (Emily James), Kathleen Magginetti (Amy James) ----- our story has Don ""Red"" Barry who can be in two places at the same time swearing to never use his guns again...but is there someone out there impersonating him, will Marshal Robert Lowery believe and help him prove he's not pulling off all the lawlessness on the Lippert Picture lot ----- special footnote actor Don ""Red"" Barry was a college football star, went into acting on the stage then to Hollywood, played various henchmen and villains then got a big break as Red Ryder in the Republic Pictures serial ""Adventures of Red Ryder"" (1940). Although he had appeared in westerns for two years or so, this was the one that would keep him there. He would acquire the nickname ""Red"" from his association with the Red Ryder character. After the success of ""Red Ryder"" Barry starred in a string of westerns for Republic, ""The Tulsa Kid"" (1940), ""Frontier Vengeance"" (1940), ""Texas Terrors"" (1940), ""The Phantom Cowboy"" (1941), ""The Apache Kid"" (1941), ""Arizona Terrors"" (1942), ""The Sombrero Kid"" (1942), ""Carson City Cyclone"" (1943), Studio chief Herbert J. Yates got the idea that Barry could be Republic's version of James Cagney, as he was short and had the same scrappy, feisty nature that Cagney had, Barry could in fact be a good actor when he wanted to be--as he showed in the WW II drama ""The Purple Heart"" (1944), then came ""I Shot Billy the Kid"" (1950), ""Jesse James' Women"" (1954), ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" (1955)...appeared in over 225 films and various television series right up until his death in 1980 ----- there's a great deal of entertainment here for all the film noir fans out there...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features like this one.
