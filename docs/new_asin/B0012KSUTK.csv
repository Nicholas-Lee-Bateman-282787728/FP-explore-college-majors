3091666,5,B0012KSUTK,Another great collection of movies starring the talented Bette Davis. No other actress comes close! She's #1!!!,1222732800,2,111,5.588235294117647
3091667,5,B0012KSUTK,I only have one thing to say. I love Bette Davis & I have as many of her movies as I can. I watch them over & over. All are great & this is a wonderful way to get many at one time.,1215734400,4,180,3.2093023255813953

3091669,3,B0012KSUTK,"My title refers to the fact that the Joan Crawford ""Hush,Hush Sweet Charlotte footage is absent despite one poster claiming that there was more than ten minutes included. There are quite a few production stills of Joan Crawford on the set and in scenes.

Since Bette Davis is always worth watching, the set is worth having. If you are buying it (as I did) mainly for Crawford footage; there a'int any!!!",1208995200,7,403,4.676056338028169
3091670,1,B0012KSUTK,"I ordered this set through Amazon, and when it arrived, three of the films (Charlotte, Eve and Phone Call) didn't play at all. They just kept spinning in my dvd player as if my player couldn't read the discs. So I sent it back, and the new set arrived today. Same exact problem with Eve and Charlotte; they don't play at all, although the supplemental disc for Eve does. Now, my dvd player is almost seven years old, but it plays everything, including new releases just fine. I'm at a loss. Guess I'll try playing these discs on a friend's dvd player and see what happens. If they still don't play, then there some majorly defective discs out there!",1208476800,6,649,4.46218487394958
3091671,4,B0012KSUTK,"20th Century FOx doesn't hold many Bette Davis movies so they stash all of them in this fine box. But how? In slimline cases, so kinda cheap, maybe not, but what kind of idiot packs a two-disc edition in slimline case WITH a booklet inside that obvisouly is going to be punched through in the middle several times because that's how the casing works? Only idiots approve these. It's really a low low shot and I would not expect this from ANYONE, not even the cheapest studio ever. It's just unbelievable. And that's supposed to be the special edition movie of the pack!!!!
As for the content, no complaint there, and love the extras on Hush Hush where for the first time I see more than one still of Joan Crawford on the set and there's even a featurette on the backstory.",1208304000,18,772,4.443661971830986
3091672,2,B0012KSUTK,"Did we really need to reissue ""All About Eve"" and ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" again?  The new ""extras"" in these (especially those in ""Eve"") aren't worth forking over the extra bucks.

I was looking forward to the ""Charlotte"" extras but found them disappointing.  There are stills of Joan Crawford's scenes but the actual filmed footage of her as Miriam is not included being either lost or they just didn't include it.  There are interviews here with Michael Merrill, Bruce Dern, and Robert Aldrich's daughter but again, it isn't worth buying the box set for this.

The rest of the films are Davis ""lesser"" films...""Phone Call From a Stranger"", ""The Virgin Queen"" and ""The Nanny"".  Of these three, ""The Nanny"" is the most entertaining but other than a theatrical trailer and photo stills, no extras are included.

I would rather they have included ""Beyond the Forest"", ""The Sisters"", and ""Dangerous"".

This boxed set is a disappointment.  If it was on sale for $20.00 I'd say go ahead and buy it, but at $40.00 to $50.00 for films that have already been released on DVD and for mediocre films, I do not recommend this set.",1207785600,17,1124,4.782383419689119
3091673,5,B0012KSUTK,"""All About Eve"" & ""Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte"" are re-issued and re-packaged with new extras in this fine set. New to DVD are ""The Virgin Queen"", ""The Nanny"", and ""Phone Call From a Stranger"".  All are encased in their own individual slim-cases with art work. For Davis fans, this edition is completely worth it. A bravura array of Davis performances is featured here. And the performances couldn't be more different: a Broadway star, a haunted Southern recluse, a Queen of England, a British nanny, and the small but pivotal role of a wife of a plane crash victim. The prints are fine and the extras are good including a 4-page booklet with added info on each film. As with all these sets, it just leaves you wanting more. However, this one was worth waiting for. Enjoy.",1207612800,31,772,4.718518518518518
3091674,3,B0012KSUTK,"This new box looks lovely, but why not put movies in it that have not already been released on DVD, like Warner Bros did with the Bette Davis Collection Vol. 2 + 3?

""All about Eve"" has already has numerous re-releases, and I think ""The Nanny"" has already been re-released on DVD three times. ""The queen"" and ""Charlotte"" have had been released to dvd once.

Now Bette Davis fans are 'forced' to buy this dvd-box just for 'Phonecall from a stranger"", in which Bette plays only a minor part, which hasn't been released on DVD before.

They can keep the box;  I'll only buy ""Phonecall"" as a single dvd.",1204675200,6,599,4.467889908256881
3091675,4,B0012KSUTK,"This is the second of two boxed sets celebrating the one hundredth birthday of Bette Davis. The other one is from Warner Home Video, and since Bette Davis is often called ""the fifth Warner Brother"", obviously Warner's has a much larger library of films from which to choose. My main complaint with this set is not that the films are not good, but that two of the films - ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" and ""All About Eve"" have already been released by Fox under the Studio Classics label. That leaves only three films new to DVD in this set.

As for the three films that are new to DVD, chances are you may have never even heard of them, much less seen them. The problem is that Fox owns the rights, won't let anyone else such as Turner Classic Movies televise them, and would rather televise ""Wall Street"" ten times a month on the Fox Movie Channel rather than put these older good films on at all.

All About Eve (1950) - This film brought Davis' career back from the brink and set up a very productive second act in her career. Margo (Bette Davis) plays an insecure aging star who helps a very poisonous young ingenue, Eve, (Anne Baxter) get started. As Margo, Davis throws some of the best tantrums of her career. Just when you think there is nobody more evil than Anne Baxter's Eve Harrington, along comes George Sander's Addison DeWitt and kicks her to the curb in that category.

Phone Call From a Stranger (1952) - This is an odd pick for a boxed set about Bette Davis, since she has practically a cameo role here. Instead the lead role goes to Davis' husband at the time, Gary Merrill. The film is about four strangers on a plane that is destined to crash. Only one survives (Gary Merrill). After the crash, he goes to contact the families of the three who did not survive the crash and finds three very different groups of people with different problems. You hardly ever see this one on TV, and it is very good so that is too bad. Just don't expect big doses of Davis in this one.

The Queen (1955) - This is Davis' second film in which she plays Queen Elizabeth I of England. Personally, I thought 1939's ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" was better, but it is hard to compare the two since this film takes place 15 years earlier in history than ""Private Lives"" and has Davis essentially playing Elizabeth at the age - 47 - that Davis actually is. Here Richard Todd plays Sir Walter Raleigh, who, like Essex in the earlier film, is a younger man who trades on Elizabeth's love for him to gain some personal glory. Richard Todd plays Raleigh effectively, but there is just no topping the charisma of Flynn in the earlier movie. Special features:
Behind the Scenes - A ""Making Of"" featurette

Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte (1964) - Meant to be a kind of sequel to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", this film is missing the dynamic of those dueling actresses, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Instead we have the perennial sweet thing of the golden age of Hollywood, Olivia de Havilland, playing opposite to Bette Davis. As a teenager Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis) was presumed guilty of killing her married lover. Her wealthy father got her out of it, but Charlotte has lived as a recluse ever since and is facing eviction from the family plantation. Her cousin Miriam Deering (Olivia de Havilland) comes to visit just as Charlotte seems to be going over the edge with visions of her murdered lover from 37 years before.

The Nanny (1965) - Another one you don't see very often anywhere. In fact it's been years since I've seen it and I can't even remember where. Ten year old Joey has a new nanny, Bette Davis. I don't think she even had a name in this one, just ""the nanny"". Nobody believes disturbed Joey when he claims that the nanny is evil and wants to kill him - she's such a sweet old lady. You know where this one is probably going from the start, but it's interesting to watch it play out. However, there is some very disturbing stuff in this one, so note that it might be difficult to watch. It takes real advantage of the fact that Davis could play anything from the sweetest to the most evil person in the world, and turn on a dime at either end of the scale.

All of the films have trailers and a stills gallery as extras. I am rating this set as follows:

Value - 3 stars due to the two double-dips.
Quality - 5 stars since the films are all very good.

Result: 4 stars",1201305600,66,5336,4.6025236593059935

A ""centennial"" collection should feature the best of the best of a particular artist, yes.  I agree with that.  But what backstreet no-good-niks thought of this collection as celebratory?  ""All About Eve""?  Again?  ""Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte"" we've already seen innumerable times and own it and yes, sometimes, can even quote from it.  ""The Nanny""?  ""Phone Call From A Stranger""?  Interesting films but nowhere near what should be in a ""centennial"" celebration.  Who the hell okayed this overpriced mess????

""The Virgin Queen"".  Ah.  This film came to be ""refound"" in the 80's after Joan Collins (who has a role in it) sped to TV stardom as the yes-I'm-a-woman-but-I've-a-drag-queen-mentality scheming Alexis on ""Dynasty"".  When everyone wanted to know more about Joan Collins this turkey showed up on her (and Bette's) resume.  It's an overhyped, lousy and gamy film.

Only idiots approve these. It's really a low low shot and I would not expect this from ANYONE, not even the cheapest studio ever. It's just unbelievable. And that's supposed to be the special edition movie of the pack!!!!
As for the content, no complaint there, and love the extras on Hush Hush where for the first time I see more than one still of Joan Crawford on the set and there's even a featurette on the backstory.",1208304000,18,772,4.443661971830986
3326169,2,B0012KSUTK,"Did we really need to reissue ""All About Eve"" and ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" again?  The new ""extras"" in these (especially those in ""Eve"") aren't worth forking over the extra bucks.

I was looking forward to the ""Charlotte"" extras but found them disappointing.  There are stills of Joan Crawford's scenes but the actual filmed footage of her as Miriam is not included being either lost or they just didn't include it.  There are interviews here with Michael Merrill, Bruce Dern, and Robert Aldrich's daughter but again, it isn't worth buying the box set for this.

The rest of the films are Davis ""lesser"" films...""Phone Call From a Stranger"", ""The Virgin Queen"" and ""The Nanny"".  Of these three, ""The Nanny"" is the most entertaining but other than a theatrical trailer and photo stills, no extras are included.

I would rather they have included ""Beyond the Forest"", ""The Sisters"", and ""Dangerous"".

This boxed set is a disappointment.  If it was on sale for $20.00 I'd say go ahead and buy it, but at $40.00 to $50.00 for films that have already been released on DVD and for mediocre films, I do not recommend this set.",1207785600,17,1124,4.782383419689119

For Davis fans, this edition is completely worth it. A bravura array of Davis performances is featured here. And the performances couldn't be more different: a Broadway star, a haunted Southern recluse, a Queen of England, a British nanny, and the small but pivotal role of a wife of a plane crash victim. The prints are fine and the extras are good including a 4-page booklet with added info on each film. As with all these sets, it just leaves you wanting more. However, this one was worth waiting for.

""All about Eve"" has already has numerous re-releases, and I think ""The Nanny"" has already been re-released on DVD three times. ""The queen"" and ""Charlotte"" have had been released to dvd once.

Now Bette Davis fans are 'forced' to buy this dvd-box just for 'Phonecall from a stranger"", in which Bette plays only a minor part, which hasn't been released on DVD before.

They can keep the box;  I'll only buy ""Phonecall"" as a single dvd.",1204675200,6,599,4.467889908256881
3326172,4,B0012KSUTK,"This is the second of two boxed sets celebrating the one hundredth birthday of Bette Davis. The other one is from Warner Home Video, and since Bette Davis is often called ""the fifth Warner Brother"", obviously Warner's has a much larger library of films from which to choose. My main complaint with this set is not that the films are not good, but that two of the films - ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" and ""All About Eve"" have already been released by Fox under the Studio Classics label. That leaves only three films new to DVD in this set.

As for the three films that are new to DVD, chances are you may have never even heard of them, much less seen them. The problem is that Fox owns the rights, won't let anyone else such as Turner Classic Movies televise them, and would rather televise ""Wall Street"" ten times a month on the Fox Movie Channel rather than put these older good films on at all.

All About Eve (1950) - This film brought Davis' career back from the brink and set up a very productive second act in her career. Margo (Bette Davis) plays an insecure aging star who helps a very poisonous young ingenue, Eve, (Anne Baxter) get started. As Margo, Davis throws some of the best tantrums of her career. Just when you think there is nobody more evil than Anne Baxter's Eve Harrington, along comes George Sander's Addison DeWitt and kicks her to the curb in that category.

Phone Call From a Stranger (1952) - This is an odd pick for a boxed set about Bette Davis, since she has practically a cameo role here. Instead the lead role goes to Davis' husband at the time, Gary Merrill. The film is about four strangers on a plane that is destined to crash. Only one survives (Gary Merrill). After the crash, he goes to contact the families of the three who did not survive the crash and finds three very different groups of people with different problems. You hardly ever see this one on TV, and it is very good so that is too bad. Just don't expect big doses of Davis in this one.

The Queen (1955) - This is Davis' second film in which she plays Queen Elizabeth I of England. Personally, I thought 1939's ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" was better, but it is hard to compare the two since this film takes place 15 years earlier in history than ""Private Lives"" and has Davis essentially playing Elizabeth at the age - 47 - that Davis actually is. Here Richard Todd plays Sir Walter Raleigh, who, like Essex in the earlier film, is a younger man who trades on Elizabeth's love for him to gain some personal glory. Richard Todd plays Raleigh effectively, but there is just no topping the charisma of Flynn in the earlier movie. Special features:
Behind the Scenes - A ""Making Of"" featurette

Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte (1964) - Meant to be a kind of sequel to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", this film is missing the dynamic of those dueling actresses, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Instead we have the perennial sweet thing of the golden age of Hollywood, Olivia de Havilland, playing opposite to Bette Davis. As a teenager Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis) was presumed guilty of killing her married lover. Her wealthy father got her out of it, but Charlotte has lived as a recluse ever since and is facing eviction from the family plantation. Her cousin Miriam Deering (Olivia de Havilland) comes to visit just as Charlotte seems to be going over the edge with visions of her murdered lover from 37 years before.

The Nanny (1965) - Another one you don't see very often anywhere. In fact it's been years since I've seen it and I can't even remember where. Ten year old Joey has a new nanny, Bette Davis. I don't think she even had a name in this one, just ""the nanny"". Nobody believes disturbed Joey when he claims that the nanny is evil and wants to kill him - she's such a sweet old lady. You know where this one is probably going from the start, but it's interesting to watch it play out. However, there is some very disturbing stuff in this one, so note that it might be difficult to watch. It takes real advantage of the fact that Davis could play anything from the sweetest to the most evil person in the world, and turn on a dime at either end of the scale.

All of the films have trailers and a stills gallery as extras. I am rating this set as follows:

Value - 3 stars due to the two double-dips.
Quality - 5 stars since the films are all very good.

Result: 4 stars",1201305600,66,5336,4.6025236593059935

""Phone Call From A Stranger""?  Interesting films but nowhere near what should be in a ""centennial"" celebration.  Who the hell okayed this overpriced mess????

""The Virgin Queen"".  Ah.  This film came to be ""refound"" in the 80's after Joan Collins (who has a role in it) sped to TV stardom as the yes-I'm-a-woman-but-I've-a-drag-queen-mentality scheming Alexis on ""Dynasty"".  When everyone wanted to know more about Joan Collins this turkey showed up on her (and Bette's) resume.  It's an overhyped, lousy and gamy film.

3326315,5,B0012KSUTK,"The Bette Davis Centenary Collection is an interesting collection of her films. These films from the 1950s and the 1960s show the broad range of Miss Davis' acting gifts. The only odd choice is Phone Call From A Stranger. In this film Bette Davis has a very small part.

I recommend this collection.",1325548800,,299,4.6415094339622645
3326316,4,B0012KSUTK,Three great classics of Bette Davis with two weaker ones - Her performance in all is just pure Bette - Great buy - Enjoyable classics  !!!,1317427200,,138,4.3076923076923075
3326317,2,B0012KSUTK,"ok so most of these films already had a dvd release and in ""Phone call from a stranger"" Bette isn't even the main star at all!. For this collection i would have liked to see ""The catered Affair"" ""Dangerous"" ""Payment On demand"" ""Beyond the forest"" and ""Winter Meeting""",1293494400,,267,4.583333333333333

I am happy with the product - it is only dvds so there is not a lot to say about their performance! being a Bette Davis fan I just love every one of the movies.",1263686400,,342,3.9565217391304346
3326321,3,B0012KSUTK,"The films selected for this set are, by and large, satisfactory.  The Nanny could have been omitted, or better yet, included in another set for those who like her most recent films.  Chief among the criticisms which could be made of this collection is the print quality of All About Eve.  It is extremely distracting and,on a personal note, I an not very sensitive to these issues. Cannot recommend this collection.",1260489600,,415,4.816901408450704
3326322,2,B0012KSUTK,"As far as I'm concerned Bette Davis can do no wrong;however, whoever put this compilation together took advantage of my love for Bette. All about Eve and Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte were excellent movies, but they boxed them with 3 duds. The Nanny was horrible. Bette isn't hardly in Phone Call from a Stranger, and I haven't had the stomach to watch the Virgin Queen. Save yourself some money and watch All About Eve on TCM and buy the individual DVD for Hush Hush.",1242518400,3,464,4.535714285714286
