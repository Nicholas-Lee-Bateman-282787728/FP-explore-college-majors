333966,4,6301558448,"""That'll be the Day"" is a small, well written and acted film made in 1973 that shares similar themes with the better known ""Quadrophenia"" made 5 years later.  Side note:  In ""That'll be the Day,"" the Who's Keith Moon has a cameo as a drummer, and the Pete Townshend composition ""Long Live Rock,"" is heard at a dance hall.  Both films tell the story of young men in their late teens/early twenties in England who become disillusioned with their lives and most everything around them.  In ""Quadrophenia,"" Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels) quits his job and runs Ace Face's (Sting) scooter off the seaside cliffs, symbolically severing his ties with the ""Mod"" lifestyle.  The future for Jimmy is uncertain at the end of ""Quadrophenia.""  The ending of ""That'll be the Day,"" however, is much less ambiguous as Jim MacLaine (David Essex) leaves his job and family (including his infant child) for the life of a rock star (further continued in the 1974 sequel ""Stardust"").
Like ""Quadrophenia,"" ""That'll be the Day"" is not a musical, though it has plenty of music in it, including the likes of Richie Valens, the Everly Brothers, Dion, etc.  The live bands at the dance halls, for the most part, play cover versions of American artists.  The real rock stars in the film -- Essex, Ringo Starr, and Billy Fury and Keith Moon in small cameos -- all do an excellent acting job.  Essex, in particular, is terrific as Jim and Ringo, as Jim's carny friend Mike, proves that he really can act in a serious role, given the right material (his work here will make you quickly forget about ""Caveman"").  Rosemary Leach, as Jim's mother, and Rosalind Ayres, as the wife he leaves, are also impressive.  Even the small roles are well cast in this film.  There's a great scene where young Jim breaks into a seaside arcade on his birthday and proceeds to get drunk.  Along comes an English bobby on a bicycle.  Rather than arresting him for breaking & entering and disorderly conduct, the compassionate policeman helps Jim home.  It's a small, but wonderfully played scene by Ron Hackett as the policeman.  Such are the performances throughout this film.
Anchor Bay, as usual, does a great job with the visual presentation of this film, but save for a trailer (shown, for some inexplicable reason, in three different sizes!), there are no extras.  This is the type of film where a commentary from David Essex, or the film's director (Claude Whatham) or screenwriter (Ray Connolly) really would have added a lot for fans, in much the way that Director Franc Roddam's commentary added to the viewing experience of ""Quadrophenia.""  If and when ""Stardust"" is ever released on DVD, let's hope that ""the powers that be"" will include a commentary track (hint:  Director Michael Apted would be great).
Note:  Despite it's PG rating, this is not a children's film.  In addition to some unsavory characters and mild profanity, there is implied sex as well as a surprisingly graphic sex scene for a PG rated film (the MPAA ratings standards were much laxer in the early 1970s then they are now).  Mercifully, there is no drug usage.",1018915200,15,3091,4.7924528301886795
333967,4,6301558448,"From Anchor Bay Entertainment comes the long-awaited restored version of a classic rock movie.
The place is Britain.  The time: 1958.  Said to be based on the early life of John Lennon, this honest and gritty drama is widely considered to be the best depiction of the 1950's British rock scene. Jim McLain (David Essex) leaves home and takes a series of low level jobs at a seaside amusement park.  His new friend, played by Ringo Starr, introduces him to a world of tawdry sex and petty crime.  Jim's world comes to a shocking and brutal end and he returns home to face his adult future as the local music scene explodes.  Will it be responsible adulthood or a new phenomenon called Rock & Roll?  The soundtrack features songs by The Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion, Del Shannon and more as well as David Essex's # 1 hit ""Rock On.""  A terrific movie if you like classic rock.  Straightforward direction by Claude Whatham.  (Widescreen, 91 minutes, Rated PG)",1009929600,3,965,4.662721893491124
333968,4,6301558448,"I really enjoyed this film, not just because of the great music, but because it portrays the life I have always wanted to lead. Everyone wants to be a pop star, don't they? (If not, you might not enjoy this so much). I was a bit baffled by the shift forward in time by its sequel Stardust, which seems to take place in the 1970s whereas this is set in the 1950s. Writer Ray Connolly has written a lot about the Beatles, so the film's story has some similarities to their life, but it is clearly not meant to be about any one actual person any more than Spinal Tap is meant to be about Status Quo. Nevertheless the central performances from David Essex and Ringo Starr are good, and there is a superb cameo by Billy Fury, reason alone to buy this film if you're a Fury fan!",1005523200,2,772,4.1879194630872485
333969,4,6301558448,"I enjoyed this movie 28 years ago and haven't seen it since. Some films are like that, you watch them once then many years later you realise you simply ""must"" go back to school. ""That'll Be The Day"" is such a film. It was that good. Why have I waited so long?",976579200,,259,4.0
334000,5,6301558448,"When I first saw ""That'll Be the Day"" and ""Stardust"" I was suffering a night of insomnia back in the 1970s when HBO was new and was keeping their programming on until 3 AM on Friday and Saturday nights. Not many people realize that Sunday through Thursday back then HBO ceased transmitting at midnight. Anyway, They showed the two movies back-to-back and I was mesmerized. The reality of the world of rock-n-roll was tremendous and driven home even more so by the appearance of Keith Moon and Ringo Starr. The fact that the banner star was David Essex (whose hit song ""Dream Weaver"" was going to number one with a bullet at the time) was interesting considering that he had very little acting experience but his performance as Jim MacLaine was outstanding as the hapless street urchin in Liverpool with gobs of talent (ala The Beatles) who goes on to co-found a band called The Stray Cats (not to be confused with Brian Seltzer's later band of the same name although I've often wondered if he took the name from the film or not?) which is the most popular rock band in history (also mirroring The Beatles career).

Subsequently the instant fame is overwhelming and the pressure to turn music out like a jukebox causes infighting to happen and a tug-o-war begins between the two most talented members of the band causing the entire situation to implode. Although the circumstances surrounding this fictional band's collapse is radically different the outcome is the same: The two former members of the groups who were best friends become bitter enemies and rivals as they embark on solo careers with MacLaine having the most successful career of the two.

In the end MacLaine has every material need a man could want but his ego pushes all his friends away and he has no emotional relationships with anyone. His only apparent outlet is a syringe full of heroine.

The crescendo scene comes when he shuts the blinds to his bedroom and plays the song ""Layla"" by Derek and the Dominos on his stereo as loud as it will go.

I won't give it away but for it's time the film was a snoot full of reality and considering that The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, not only was in the film but wrote it as well it was entirely too spooky that the fate of MacLaine and the real fate of Moon were so much alike.",1311638400,3,2291,4.580487804878048
334001,5,6301558448,"I'd seen STARDUST in a theatre about 25 years ago, and loved it.  I could never find it on DVD in the US, so was so happy to track this seller down.  They responded quickly to say that I could, in fact, view the UK-version on my computer.  It worked out well & i was very pleased with the prompt service.",1306022400,3,304,3.9508196721311477
334002,1,6301558448,"I gave this movie one star because it did show the late Billy Fury in action as well as having a very nice, though very short, drum solo from Keith Moon.

This movie is not just about the Fifties as one reviewer suggested nor only about the Sixties as another indicated.  The period covered is the late Fifties to the early Sixties though it is often anachronistic if we are to follow strictly the film's implied chronology.

The central figure in the movie is regarded in too friendly a fashion by some reviewers here.  ""A working class lad"" who is ""bedding ladies"" flatters both the grammar school dropout and his usually willing 'victims' who are seen as mostly concerned that no one discovers their furtive sexual adventure (""You won't tell anyone will you?"") rather than weak and naive dupes who really only want to marry a cute boy and have babies as another reviewer seems to imply. There are  three truly sympathetic figures in the film:  the boy's mother, his young wife and his best friend who he repays in false coin by deflowering his fiancee.

This movie seems to belong to the growing genre that over-glamorizes rock and roll and its sometimes degraded protagonists and seeks to want to reconstruct the early rock era to some extent in the shoddy image of much of the film industry.  I am a fan of rock music myself and I actually  grew up in this time period.  Some of the movie rings very true but much is overdrawn, blurred and misrepresented.  Those who see the central figure in the film as ""typical"" of his time are right in some instances (such as his love of rock music and recurring daydreams about being rich and famous) but are also wrong in fundamentals.  As some have said, and as the movie indicates, neither Essex or Starr play the parts of ""typical"" teens but typical ROGUE teens who steal and fornicate freely and with little or no evidence of conscience.  Everyone knew people something like this but they were not usually regarded sympathetically.  Starr is ultimatley portrayed as at least marginally more sexually moral and responsible than Essex. It is he who is beaten up for his blatant thievery while Essex suffers no consequences for his actions.  You would think that the actions of the character Essex plays would have led to at least his being the recipient of an occasional good drubbing himself, a paternity suit or two, as well as an occasional anxious trip  to the V.D. clinic (although he does seem to, at times, prey on the sexually inexperienced - even to the point of apparently raping a thirteen year old girl ignoring her repeated protests and pleas).  While my generation were all more or less flawed this kind of behavior would be roundly condemned by most all of us, yet the film-smiths treat it all glibly and in fact rather like one big romp, and make Essex come out of it all apparently unhurt and the script dumps his victims as readily and as blithely as does the film's central character.

The final and total product is totally uninspiring, unreal,  and as pointless and amoral as it main protagonist.  The comparison with ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is rather apposite in one important sense, as would be comparisons generally with the whole genre of films it represents.  The villain and any implied ""rebellion against society's mores"", if that is what is really intended or implied, is shallow, empty and irresponsible.",1300320000,,3381,4.715986394557823
334003,5,6301558448,"This is a brilliant film.  Probably the most realistic portrait of the 'rock'n'roll dream that we British kids lived, - ever portrayed on the big screen, (now the small screen via DVD).  When I saw it I thought ""Wow, that was me! - that lovable (and self loving) rat"" thinking of love (sex) when the girls we were dating were thinking of love (marriage and babies).  You can smugly run your moralistic slide rules over it if you want, but remember - it's only the moralistic values you've been fed by some establishment controllers wanting to up the birth rate, and keeping the human race to survive for another 6 million years.  This is the early 'sixties fan's sides view of Heartbreak Hotel, When I Saw Her Standing There, and Foxy Lady.  So what's the American equivalent of this one? - The Last Picture Show? American Graffiti?",1262822400,,832,4.63265306122449
334004,5,6301558448,"I've been hoping to get ahold of a DVD of this, but settled for the VHS so I would at least have some form of it.  This is mostly available from British online stores and thus only in PAL form and/or ""Region 2"" DVDs - incompatible with US DVD players.

Getting the chance to see the REAL Keith Moon and Ringo Starr doing great jobs as actors in a Rock n Roll historical fable is a real treat.  I only paid a few bucks for this and it's a cornerstone of my Rock Library.

Now if I could just get this as a DVD with the sequel ""Stardust"" which continues the tale into the 70's - That would be hip...",1199059200,,597,3.95
334005,5,6301558448,"Seems everyone who denigrates this movie at all, does so bc Essex's character is such a scumbag. That's what makes it real. I felt I was almost watching a documentary.",1170374400,4,167,4.6
334006,3,6301558448,"David Essex stars in this movie about a young knockabout in 60s Britain who is attracted to rock and roll, mainly as a way of avoiding the responsibilities of work and adulthood in general. The movie has a great authentic atmosphere, but the viewpoint about the main character is not clear. It's removed, almost documentary tone reminded me of ""Georgie Girl.""

Ringo Starr has a featured role as a carnival worker who befriends him and shows him the ropes. He is outstanding, and made me wish he had more movie roles like this one.",1163030400,,531,4.648936170212766
334007,4,6301558448,"This film evokes the fifties rock 'n' roll period quite well, thank you.  The film tells the story of a disaffected youth (David Essex) who runs away from the monotony of his ""normal life"" and it's inherent responsibilities.  He finds himself working odd jobs at a seaside carnival where he befriends another kindred soul(Ringo Starr).  Later, he gets his girlfriend pregnant and finds the responsibility of husband and father so overbearing when he hears the clarion call of rock 'n' roll.  David Essex is quite excellent in the lead role, and the film is at pains not to portray his decisions as noble ones.  What I don't get is that Essex's character is supposed to be a John Lennon type but I just don't see it.  Ringo gives probably his best screen appearance, ever!  It's the first time I've seen a film he's appeared in where you think he's in character and not an extension of his Beatles persona.  It's also good to see Keith Moon in a nice little cameo.  I'm still waiting for the film's sequel, ""Stardust"" to come out on DVD.",1099008000,3,1036,4.586956521739131
334008,3,6301558448,"Other than a brief, but tantalizing few scenes with Billy Fury, there isn't much charisma in the stars.  I bought this dvd for the Billy Fury scenes.  Billy is incredible. His image and performances are vital.  Wish they'd had just footage of his performances as a bonus on the dvd.  David Essex plays his role well, but the character is very unlikable.  Ringo is excellent.",1072742400,,374,4.6923076923076925
334009,2,6301558448,"I really wanted to enjoy this film. I've always been very passionate about music, and always wanted to be a musician, myself. I purchased this DVD due to the reviews here and elsewhere, but I have to say I was disappointed.
The film is long..and boring. It is not a rock and roll film, per se. I was expecting that mid-way through the film, the character of Jim will have started a rock band and have played a major role in helping to bring about the British Invasion. Not so.  This is just a story about a directionless young man who quits school, gets seasonal jobs to support himself, engages in cheap sex, watches (and does nothing) as his friend Mike (Ringo) gets beaten up by customers, comes home after two years, marries and has a kid, then leaves them and everyone else to embark on his rock and roll dream. END OF PICTURE.
The music is great and the film DOES have potential. But I think it would have been better served to have half of the movie reflect Jim's disillusionment and aimlessness, and the other half reflect what happened as a result of this. As it stands, watching this film is like going to the theatre, and having to leave just as the movie starts.  You never get to see what becomes of Jim as he embraces his new-found ""freedom"".  For that, I guess you have to see the sequel they mention.
I love David Essex in this movie. He's very cute and a good actor. Disappointing, however, was his character. He's not a very sympathetic ""bloke""; rather, he's self-absorbed, deceitful and a cheat..and certainly not anyone you can depend upon in your time of need.
Ringo does a great turn and it's interesting to see him in this context. I am a big Beatle fan, and I enjoyed seeing him in something different and stretching his obvious acting abilities.
That said, I think this movie could have been much better. To add insult to injury, they listed ""Rock On"" as being in the movie, but nowhere do you hear it played in the film. Perhaps it was in the sequel, but then the makers of this film should not have deceived the public into thinking it is heard in the film, because it isn't.
Maybe a second viewing of this film will put things in better perspective for me, but for now, this is my opinion and I'm sticking to it.",1062720000,2,2240,4.405797101449275

7812583,4,6301558448,"Less a film and its sequel than the 1st and 2nd act of one story, these two films are much more powerful seen together than separately.

Together the two films give us over 3 hours of the life of Jim MacLaine as he goes from bright mid 1950s schoolboy to an aimless drifter shagging every woman he can get his hands on, breaking the hearts of everyone close to him, to stumbling into a career in rock 'n roll, to becoming one of the biggest stars in the world, with all the attendant hollowness of super-stardom in a business designed to make you self your soul and lose sight of what's real.

This 2nd film makes up the rock-star years of Jim's life, but the 1st film makes it clear that his self-destructive tendencies were there long before stardom, And if he's taken advantage of by managers and record labels, he's also a man who was amoral, selfish and at sea long before that.

It's a shame that pop star David Essex isn't an even stronger actor. He's not at all bad, but this is the kind of rich, juicy role in which a great actor could have exposed multiple layers of depth and complexity. Essex does his best, and is always natural, but isn't able to go that step beyond. (director Michael Apted apparently learned that lesson, and had actors play singers to great effect in his later 'Coal Miner's Daughter').

It would also have been great if the films had managed to avoid some of the clichs around the music business and sex, drugs and rock and roll. It may well be that they're clichs because they're true, but we've also seen them many times, in many films before  even by 1974 when 'Stardust' was made.

One odd thought; on some level 'Stardust' seems to be channeling Peter Watkins' far more original, political and challenging 1967 U.K. rock film ""Privilege', with more slickness, but less grand ambition. No idea if that's intentional, but watching this film made we want to go back and re-visit that one.",1420502400,,1925,4.517241379310345
