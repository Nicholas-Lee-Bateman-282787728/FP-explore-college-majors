8112492,1,B000EOTVX4,"This 2004 Mexican movie was basically pretty bad.  There really isn't a plot, just family members cheating, marrying, planning to cheat, etc.  I can't put it into any understandable structure.

First of all, I call it an advertiser's dream, what I assume are mostly Procter and Gamble products properly placed in perfect view of the camera.  Products in the medicine cabinet, products on the kitchen counter, Max Factor products in the bathroom, products in the grocery store, etc.  Products so nicely arranged for viewing.

It is a film with pretty people everywhere, no creativity with characters, just pretty people.  I don't know the actors as some are from Mexico, and it appears others from Puerto Rico.  It is supposed to be funny, but really falls flat.

Also, at one point, a microphone attendant is accidently in view, holding the microphone over the actors.  The home is beautiful, colorful, and the subtitles are nice, large and clear to read.  The best and only good part of the movie was the end, where Mariachi Nuevo Mexico sings.

What I can't believe is that there is a sequel to this !!  Rizzo",1254787200,,1111,4.814814814814815
8112493,1,B000EOTVX4,"I rented this movie in the belief it follows the recent trend of rather good movies filmed in Puerto Rico like Casi Casi, Ladrones Y Mentirosos among others. I should have known better when I saw Nydia Caro as part of the cast. She was a good singer but NEVER an actress of any kind. However I saw Fernando Allende in the cast and gave it a try. Nydia Caro delivered in being a bad actress, but Allende established a new low point on his career. If there is someone who deserves a Razzy award will be him, he makes Steven Segal look like Oscar material. The script was beyond bad, awful, dumb, superficial. The direction was even worse. To be honest I think the actors on this movies must have worked on commission and not paid. I give it a minus 5 in a scale of 10 and it bumps the late 1980's movie Salsa with Robbie Rosa out of my list of worse movie ever. Don't waste you money on this movie, go play the lottery with it or give it to a street bum. I had to give it one star because the website required me to do so.",1222992000,3,1020,4.054455445544554
8112494,3,B000EOTVX4,"I  understand why a previous reviewer was unhappy with this movie. It is superficial and sometimes insensitive. But it is also funny, and easily understood by a non-native speaker. I cringed at the stereotypical moments, but also laughed. I really liked the jealous wife portrayal.  Most of the Spanish language movies I have viewed so far have had depressing or highly sexualized themes. This was an exception to that trend. Other than the portrayal of the Chinese boss, there is nothing  I would hesitate to show my children or students. And I would use that flaw to talk about different views on cultural portrayals. Not everyone in every culture is worried about offending people. Perhaps when no offense is meant, none should be taken. This is not an artistic or intellectual film. But obviously it wasn't intended to be.",1193011200,,826,4.928057553956834
8112495,1,B000EOTVX4,"This movie was a terrible dissappointment. It was vulgar and insipid. It was insulting to the different cultures represented. I bought it to show to my first year college students and was so thoroughly disgusted, I threw it away.  Thankfully I previewed it before I showed it and saved myself further mortification by not exposing my students to such trash. For shame on Fernando Allende and the other cast members for doing something that is not only in bad taste but insulting to our diverse and rich culture. It doesn't even deserve one star.",1192060800,,545,4.797872340425532
8112496,3,B000EOTVX4,"I recomend this movie to teachers of Spanish who want to include in their selection a light-hearted movie with family as a topic at its heart. The actors' accents and idiomatic expressions are true to their characters and authentic: Fernando Allende is Mexican, just like his character, Armando Gutirrez. Nydia Caro is Puerto Rican, just like her character Lulli. The main characters' mothers have come to join their household; their names are the same the VIrgin Mary has in Mexico (Guadalupe) and in Puerto Rico (Providencia). The Gutirrez's son is engaged to the daughter of a Cuban father and an Argentinian mother; their daughter, to a very dark-skinned gringo. They converge in their house to celebrate theire son's engagement. The situations and crises the characters go through are very comical and it all has a happy ending.

The family is modern, upper middle class but tradtions and cultural references to the different countries represented in it are there. The enunciation of the characters is clear enough for intermediate and advanced classes in Spanish. It has subtitles to help those in lower level classes. The script is more suitable for a half-hour sitcom than a movie and the editing isn't the best. Its value is more in cultural and linguistic richness.

This is a movie for those who want to see a different aspect of Hispanic cultures, a fresh modern one not based on corruption, politics, drug-trafficking, and guerrilla movements in poverty-ridden backgrounds.",1179705600,5,1486,5.136363636363637
