Both actors played together again in a movie called A Beautiful Life, which is a lot better. This movie holds its ground, good quality being dvd and good sound as well. Not as dramatic as the other one I mentioned. But great story. Highly recommend.",1458345600,,341,4.2615384615384615
8025511,4,B0002B55XE,"""The Foliage"" begins in 1974 near the end of the disastrous Cultural Revolution in China, when many young people, especially from families of intellectuals, were sent to the countryside.  Many of them, such as Xing-Yu, want to return to the cities.  In her case she is especially eager to return to Kumming to help take care of her father.

  An unexpected, accidental meeting with Sie Mong, who helps her catch a ride on a bus, has a major impact upon both of them.  While it is somewhat hard to believe he would maintain his love for her over twenty-nine years, while she married another man, this development makes for an interesting love story.

  The ending, actually a possible alternative beginning, is ambiguous, but thought provoking.  Is Xing-Yu wondering how her life would have changed if Sie Mong had not stopped the bus twenty-nine years earlier?  I am not sure.

  The very beginning of the movie, showing black and white photographs, of actual young people sent to the countyside during the Cultural Revolution is interesting.  While the events in this movie take place near the end of the Cultural Revolution, they do not convey what a terrible experience this was for hundreds of thousands of young people.  For a better historical understanding of these events, I highly recommend Jung Chang's ""Wild Swans."" one of my favorite books.

  This is a very worthwhile movie to watch and is visually enjoyable.",1193961600,5,1423,4.9033613445378155
8025512,4,B0002B55XE,"An different kind of love story that unfolds over several decades.  Shu Qi, as usual does a good job with what's she's given.  Four stars!",1170374400,,138,4.48
8025513,4,B0002B55XE,"This is a wonderful movie,a very elaborate peice of work on Chinese Communist leader's Mao ruling and governing of China in 1974.

The natives of the country were then divided in to various infantries,wear green and dull-looking clothes,and addressed each other as 'comrades'. Life was tough,and those living inthe rural plains wants to go the city.

Politics aside,The Foliage is mostly a love story. Shu Qi,who recently won Best Actress in the Golden Horse Awards (Chinese equivalent of the Oscars) for her perfomance in Three Times,portrays convincingly as Xing-Yu,a young female intellectual who has just return from the city state,and is awaiting for the goverment to grant her a discharge to move to the city.

Here,on the way back home,she befriends a young rebel,Sie Mong,who falls for her. It did not help when Xing-Yu's childhood sweetheart felt indignant as he realises she,too,is in love with Sie Mong. Because Sie Mong and Xing-Yu are both from different infantries (that is,communities),they have to share a forbidden love affair. Expect lots of clashes,fights and the death of a close friend.

The movie also goes to some 29 years later. It is poignant,as the two young lovers were not together. Xing-Yu later married,and it was only her journey back to the village for her husband's burial that she meets Sie Mong. It was only then she realised she and Sie Mong still love one another. I didn't quite get the ending part,the one where a young Xing-Yu chased after a bus while Sie Mong looks out,for in the beginning of the movie,there was another version,that is Sie Mong stopped the bus driver for Xing-Yu to come on board.

Whatever it is,i think this is a brilliant movie. It is between two young intelletuals pursing a passionate,yet forbidden love affair. It does not help that both leads,Shu Qi and Liu Ye (Sie Mong) are both eye candies.",1132358400,10,1860,4.948717948717949
