7915689,4,B00002E20D,"I'm not a full fledged expert on Roy Rogers films so when I was reading reviews, the Roan Group kept coming up as the best of the digitizing. Well I've watched both movies on this disk and they are pretty good. In Hands across the border, which in my opinion has plot problems... their is a bit where the lips and the words are not fully synchronized in the first scene at the Ranch. But it may be from the original film, I don't know. It's not a problem though watching the film. Hands Across the border is the movie where Roy meets Trigger. It's not clear that trigger belongs to him by the end of the movie, but Roy rides him as if.

In Billy the Kid returns, we have Roy as Billy, and then again as the man mistaken for Billy. (funny how people in the movie could make that mistake!) But in this movie the plot is fairly straight forward, and easy to follow with lots of gun play, fast and furious riding, and the standard group of bad guys who learned to shoot at ""The Empire's storm trooper shooting school."" (In other words, they can't hit the broad side of a barn.)

Still these movies are a slice of Americana and fun to watch. And look for the other 2 DVD's that the Roan group did.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heldorado-In-Old-Cheyenne/dp/B00004WMKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heldorado/In Old Cheyenne</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roy-Rogers-Vol-1-Roll-On-Texas-Moon-King-of-the-Cowboys-The-Days-of-Jesse-James/dp/6305436347/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roy Rogers, Vol. 1: Roll On Texas Moon/King of the Cowboys/The Days of Jesse James</a>",1234224000,,1636,5.488095238095238
7915690,5,B00002E20D,"Wonderful, Pure nostalgia, I wrote to Roy as a young lad in the early 50`s. Never had a reply. Never got over it. This certainly makes up for it...I am still the front row kid thrilling to Roy and Triggers adventures even though i am now 60 years of age..For anyone who wants to be transported back 50 odd years or so this is for you. As the Lone Ranger intro used to say. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear
 The only thing that i can never understand and i hope one day to find out. George Gabby Hayes was in most of the early ones and he was nearly always Gabby Whitaker..WHY.",1049241600,,600,4.128205128205129
7915691,5,B00002E20D,"Roy fans know these films. They have been available for years on tape. If you like Roy, you will love the films.
What makes this and the other Roan Group release special is the care that went into the restoration and DVD transfer. There are loads of bad transfers of films with a limited audience being issued, but this is NOT one of them. These discs are beautiful! In addition, the menus are coded with a musical note to indicate that a song starts at that point.
Can it GET any better than that?!? It sure can! The bonus items on Volume One are very, very cool.
I hope there is more of this catalog to come, but I have tried every way possible to contact the Roan Group. It looks like they are out of business. I suggest you get these two DVDs while you still can.",971395200,16,767,4.1891891891891895
