3555234,3,B001EJZNEE,"I would like to see more of the early episodes of Zoom. There was not enough coverage for each group of zoomers. Is it possible to get more episodes of 1972 and 1973? If so, please include me on your mailing list. What are the zoomers doing now? Is there a video or dvd showing interviews or the life styles of how the once before zoomers? I am really a nostalgic fan. Thanks for all your efforts towards putting all of the Zoom episodes together!",1269907200,4,447,4.270588235294118
3555235,5,B001EJZNEE,"I remember actually watching this show back in my elementary school days.  A lot of people I know have never heard of it because it was on public access television.  I have always wondered what had happened to some of the cast members and this set let's you know.  Glad to hear that they are all well.  My favorite thing about Zoom was ""it's time to roll out the barrel"" and ""Fannee Doolee"".  Thanks for the memories.",1264982400,8,417,4.363636363636363
3555236,3,B001EJZNEE,"I have not actually watched this DVD, but I was a huge fan of ZOOM when I was a kid. The problem with picking and choosing best moments in a program of this sort is that everyone I knew watched it for a different reason. The songs were fantastic, as were the sketches, but there were also the spots about craft projects, such as a model ship made from matchsticks and cardboard and the water walking shoes made of styrofoam and old Venitian blinds. And, of course, everybody's favorite twisted language: Ubby-dubby. I would love to be able to show the entire run of the show to my younger relatives - I think they would get a kick out of it.

There is also a fantastic teachable moment I remember very distinctly. Someone wrote in to the show calling Ubby-dubby frightening and disturbing. She even claimed it was either the language of the dead or of the Devil. One of the cast read the letter and Ubby-dubby was never spoken again on the show. Of all the things I remember from ZOOM, this one is the most vivid.

If there are any fans of ""MYTHBUSTERS"" reading this, you may remember in one of the Ninja episodes, Adam tried to build shoes which allowed him to walk on water and failed. The water walking shoes I mentioned above work perfectly - I built a pair and 'walked' across the inlet to Acabonack Harbor in Springs, NY back when I was 12.",1252972800,,1346,4.38
3555237,5,B001EJZNEE,"For those of us who were kids in the 70's, ZOOM was one of our favorite shows and one that is very fondly remembered. It was really well made and with a unique concept - kids being kids, never talking down to them and showing all the cool stuff they were capable of doing, like playing hockey, being a ham radio operator or making amateur stop-motion films.
The DVD is excellent and a must buy for any ZOOM fan. Disc one gives you a ""best of"" from the whole run of the show plus some DVD-ROM extras like computer wallpaper, ZOOM cards and ZOOM activities. Disc two gives you 4 complete episodes from different seasons, credits and all. My one complaint? The whole thing is too short! For a 2 DVD set there should have been more episodes included. Let's hope that there will be more episodes released in the future.",1231113600,18,814,4.397350993377484
3555238,5,B001EJZNEE,"I'm so glad this was finally done. Watching this not only re-educated me but I'm sure would be interesting to very young kids today. It seemed like the kids back then were more into discovery, creativity and intellectual stimulation; they didn't get easily bored - weren't caught up in the plastic of society but celebrated being an individual. When I watch this, I only remember feeling happy as a kid and forget the drag of what's going on today. There're just too many unforgettable and informative episodes in this series to stop at this DVD.  This is a successful breakthrough and will continue to be as such, in the educational system.  Highly recommended for those who want to remember 'happy' and 'carefree'.",1225238400,34,716,4.860655737704918

This DVD features different groups of kids from over the years, but only a handful of random episodes and a couple of Zoom guests.

3555248,3,B001EJZNEE,"Hubby frub-iends,

I remember Zoom from the 70's. It was the type of show that I would have never admitted to watching but secretely did. It was a little bit hip because it looked like ""street level"" kids in the ensemble. They pranced around without shoes, looked a little disheveled, and cast a little of an attitude.  I'd watch it and lusted for the similarly aged, 10, 11, 12 year old girls to myself.

In hindsight, I think this was supposed to be some kind of kids self-produced, self-written show.

By today's standards, the content could not be any cornier. A 10 year old would watch this and gag. Other than being nostalgic for somebody that grew up in the early to mid 70's, this would have no appeal.

Today, similar to Three Stooges, Twilight Zone, Monty Python, etc, this is total ""stoner"" entertainment. This is perfect for a weird 40-50 year old to get wasted to and then watch this odd little PBS show from their yesteryear.

The ""ubby dubby"" thing was their secret code, similar to pig latin.",1297814400,,1008,4.572222222222222

8298411,5,B001EJZNEE,I was completely fascinated by ZOOM as a child in the 1970's because of Bernadette and her amazing ability to create an illusion which caused her arms to appear to spin in impossible ways.  Seeing this show on DVD so clear and so sharp and to have Bernadette carefully explain to the world how she created that illusion... is worth this whole two-disc set!  It was a full circle moment to watch this after almost forty years.  A must have if you watched this show in the 1970's.,1490054400,,478,4.409090909090909

8298419,5,B001EJZNEE,"I picked this up after having seen it here and having read reviews of it, and was not disappointed. I grew up in the original Zoom program on PBS in the 1970's and was largely the target audience for this program. When it made its debut in the January of '72, I was still in the 1st grade so I literally grew up with this show and remember it well. It, along with the Electric Company amongst other shows were what I would often watch after school in the afternoons between 3-5pm or so on my local PBS station, in black & white as that was all we had for a TV for many years.

Nonetheless, have wanted this for a while and finally, in January, bought this via Amazon, along with some other items, thanks to Christmas and birthday money and am glad I did buy it as it was exactly as I remember it and have many, many fond memories of watching this show as a young kid back in the day.

Great seeing many of the segments, and hearing the classic Zoom Do intro from the second season takes me back. This, like the Electric Company are great to view even now as an adult in his middle years. I do this for ME, not anyone else, and watching the full episodes is also cool, and love that the original PBS and WGBH Boston logos were left intact, such fun to see those again.

I think my favorite cast is the second and third seasons, though the first season is great too, and love the early versions of the theme. I find the later rewrite not nearly as good, and remember feeling similar back then even.

However, a couple of things I'd love to see be released are more episodes of the original show, and include the song about bones rising again, and the Zoom Do where a an older boy builds a tree house, I think from either the 2nd season, or third season, but they all are great.

Definitely worth it for those of us who watched the show fervently as young kids and despite it being originally a VHS release, the DVD version is well done, and may have been expanded upon since it contains 2 disks, though it would be fantastic if they expanded it more and included more full episodes on extra discs, Ala the Electric Company. Oh well, at least we get to see this venerable series from back in the day.",1430697600,3,2197,4.209026128266033
