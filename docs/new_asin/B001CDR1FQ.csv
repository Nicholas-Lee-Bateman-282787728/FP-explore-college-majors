8500903,4,B001CDR1FQ,All the bands had three songs each.  That is ok for the bands I don't care for.  I really wanted to see more music from the bands I like.,1361404800,,137,3.689655172413793
8500904,2,B001CDR1FQ,"I agree that this dvd was a pretty big disappointment.  I went to this tour twice, once in Atlanta and once in Denver.  It was an amazing show and so I expected the DVD that I pre-ordered to be able to capture this.  I too was appalled with most everything to do with this DVD.  Particularly the song selection, and the lack of special features.  I think for the price each band should have gotten more songs, especially Decapitated, whom is no longer together because of the tragedy. I would like to comment though on the fact of why Arsis is not on the DVD.  For those of you who may know, Arsis had broken down while on this tour and missed quite a few shows (including the show that the dvd was filmed at).  That is why they are not on the dvd, but they should have taken their name off of the cover.  Altogether, I felt completely ripped off buying this dvd.  It's a good thing the live shows were so unbelievable.",1231372800,2,919,4.235632183908046
8500905,2,B001CDR1FQ,"great bands of the  Metal Extreme, all so brutals,
but I hoped much more of Necrophagist, more songs,
I buy this dvd for they,

I feel a little disappointed",1231286400,2,156,4.344827586206897
8500906,3,B001CDR1FQ,"Decent enough audio quality.  Video is quite dark during most sets, although the camera angles are carefully chosen.
My main gripe is that there is only one Decapitated song...and the audio mix for them is awful (bass guitar overshadows everything else significantly) If this is supposed to be in tribute to the mighty Vitek, then this DVD is actually an insult.  Check out the Winds Of Creation reissue or the Humans Dust DVD for much better footage of the band.
The Necrophagist song selection is poor as well...Stillborn isn't exactly their definitive work...and won't do anything to bring new fans to the band.  The Marco Minnemann drum solo was a nice addition, though.
Actually, with the exception of Decapitated, every band on here seemed to get shafted with song selection....
Last but certainly not least....an Arsis performance is nowhere to be found on this DVD....yet they played the tour and are listed on the front cover!
Overall Pick this one up in the used bin, don't blow $20 on it.",1222560000,,999,4.864705882352941
8500907,1,B001CDR1FQ,"Not even close to what I expected. I thought maybe 2 songs from the support bands, fine.  But the whole setlist of necrophagist at least.  No only 2 songs from each band.  Amazing production values, but overall not worth purchasing.",1220659200,,232,4.75
8500908,2,B001CDR1FQ,"This DVD just really isn't what I expected.  To bring up what's wrong with it in a nutshell, too short, each band only plays a two song set, only one interview with any of the bands (Cephalic Carnage).  About the only good things on this movie are the sound quality and the camera work.  Other than that I can't say that I'm overly impressed by this movie in the least.  Plus, some of the songs that were chosen for the bands sets are not their best titles.",1220486400,2,457,4.218390804597701
