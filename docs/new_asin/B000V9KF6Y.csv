8217428,5,B000V9KF6Y,I loved this movie and I have been looking for it for years.  I think a scene was deleted from the original.  At the beginning of the movie I remember Donald was taking his siblings to the playground after dark and pushing them on the swings.  I am so happy to have this movie on DVD.  Every time I watch it I am just as moved as the first time I saw it.,1364860800,,354,3.808219178082192
8217429,5,B000V9KF6Y,This movie was one of my favorites & it's very emotional to see what kids go through when they are in foster care or with the adoption agencies...very touching,1356739200,,159,4.517241379310345
8217430,5,B000V9KF6Y,"This is a very touchy movie.  It is so sad to watch the 3 very mis-fortunate children growing up with pain and separation. A handkerchief is surely needed during the movie.  I watched this movie repeatedly on TV during the early 80', and had been looking for this movie for so many years.  I finally own a copy. It is a great collection to keep.",1355097600,,345,4.276923076923077

8217432,5,B000V9KF6Y,I saw the last part of this movie on TV way back in about the mid 1980s.  I've been wanting it every since.  I just received the DVD of it today.  I've waited around 25 years to finally get a copy of this movie.  I just finished watching the whole thing.  I love it!  It's a very touching and inspiring movie!  I love that heart-warming ending!  :),1341619200,,348,4.08955223880597
8217433,5,B000V9KF6Y,This film was shown on T.V. some time ago-a marvellous film-WHY OH WHY has nobody in the UK had the initiative to make it available on DVD which can be played and watched at a reasonable price-the one shown on TV starred Timothy Hutton and Rosanna Arquette-Help!,1340150400,,262,4.595744680851064
