1946158,5,B0000TWMPC,"The only qualification that I could imagine someone making about this miraculous performance is that it takes place in a very small theater on a very small stage.  But the singers are all fantastic--just to hear Florez sing Fenton's Act III aria is worth the price of admission.  The women are simply delightful, Falstaff rich and characterful; only Ford is a bit mild and reserved.  The sets are delicate, evocative and wonderfully old-fashioned (based on a 1913 Toscanini-conducted performance). Muti's conducting is light and effective--one needs to get adjusted to the lack of a full string section, but once that is made, everything flows beautifully.  This really is a great, intimate performance and video. You feel lucky to be present in a small, cultured Italian town with the best singers and musicians imaginable.",1119312000,14,824,5.172932330827067
1946159,2,B0000TWMPC,"I was persuaded to buy this dvd by the other reviewers.  As I teach this work in class, I was looking to upgrade my beloved, older vhs of the 1983 Covent Garden performance with Bruson and Giulini, so that I could more easily access selected scenes.

However, I was sorely disappointed by this performance.  Despite the reviewers' comments, I found the staging and performances to be leaden, with everyone most often simply standing in a line and singing with their eyes on the conductor, not on each other.  In fact, Maestri seemed downright uncomfortable in the role and not able to take his eyes off of Muti.  And I agree with the reviewer who said that Meastri is made up to look like Bozo the Clown!  Falstaff is a real, dimensional character -- silly yet loveable, who ultimately wins our sympathy and respect.  None of that character subtlety is in Maestri's performance for me -- especially coming on the heels of Bruson's totally convincing performance on the vhs/Covent Garden version.  At the end of this performance, as the orchestra plays out after the fugue, the Covent Garden performance has everyone dancing about in general merrymaking -- here they all simply stand in a line (again!) with their arms raised like a bad high school musical tableau.

If you're considering this performance -- keep looking.",1113955200,29,1321,4.861607142857143
1946160,5,B0000TWMPC,"I loved this production. It was lively and colorful. The costumes were copies of the 1913 production.  The singers were the best, starting with the principal singer Ambroglio Maestri. Barbara Frittoli, Frontali, Mula and Antonacci were absolutely fantastic. Bernadette Manca di Nissa was a great Mrs. Quickly. Although the stage was small, the singers were able to make the best of space. The stereo surround sound was really wonderful. The Met production cannot compare to this one. Costumes were simpler and sets not too appealing. The best of this Falstaff was the clarity of the Italian. Every singer's Italian was crisp and clear for anyone who understands Italian to catch every nuance. Bravo Verdi!

What octets and quartets!",1094342400,5,732,5.194915254237288
1946161,5,B0000TWMPC,"You will hardly find a Falstaff like this once again in your life. There is not a flaw in this DVD: the singers, the orchestra, the direction, the sound, la mise en scne, they are all simply extraordinary. The most enjoyable surprise is Ambrosio Maestri, who performs the best Falstaff  I have ever seen in my life. I used to think Bryn Terfel was the best singer in the world for  this role, but it sufficed one minute listening to Maestri's  voice to change my mind immediately. The warmth of his voice and the quality of his acting make him a perfect Sir John. Roberto Frontali and Barbara Fritolli as Mr and Mrs Ford are also wonderful. Juan Diego Flores (the great Peruvian tenor) and Inva Mula are splendid as Fenton and Nanetta. The rest of the cast are also brilliant, and Riccardo Mutti's conduction is exceptional. Finally, I want to mention that this DVD was so hard to find that the only way to get it was through the Amazon's British store",1073433600,48,952,4.491329479768786
1946162,5,B0000TWMPC,This is a traditional production with world greatest singer.  I own every Fallstaff available on DVD and this one is definitely the BEST of all....this is a MUST HAVE DVD.,1072224000,7,171,4.7
8002950,1,B0000TWMPC,"I would like to ask prospective buyers.  Do you enjoy Archie Bunker in 'All in the Family'?  Even though he has a lot of buffoonish ways and loutish opinions we disagree with, he's funny to watch. Mostly agreed?  OK then, True or False:  since he's such a buffoon, it would be even MORE enjoyable if we dressed him up and painted his face like a clown, right?  Makes sense, doesn't it?

Well, I would humbly submit: False. Archie Bunker is funny because he LOOKS normal, but ACTS far outside what we consider acceptable. Making him visually a clown would not enhance the comedy, it would destroy it.

Same goes for Falstaff.

Now, for those who say this is a 1913 production and therefore must be good.  I say, bull.  Verdi had passed on 12 years earlier, and I can't believe he would have approved. It only indicates to me there were some clueless opera designers then as well as now.

For a traditional Falstaff DVD in the vein ""I believe"" would have been awarded the composer's blessings:

8002951,2,B0000TWMPC,"I suppose I'll need to qualify this by saying that of the operas I have watched, I found this uninspiring. The score isn't great in my opinion and there are no real stunning musical moments. The plot is contrived and not well executed.

The above rests on Verdi's broad shoulders. This just isn't a great opera. It really reminded me of a senior citizen version of Glee. There is all the sexual tension of a retirement community.

If you are new to opera, don't add this to your collection until you've been through the wealth of better selections.

The camera work is good. Sir John is a buffoon and does look the part of Bozo the Clown. The acting is 'hammy'. This may be the best production available but it's not an opera most will appreciate.

UPDATE: I bought the Von Karajan version from 1982. I love it!!!! That completely changed my opinion of this opera. In fact, that production makes this production look so bad, I took off another star. I'm glad I didn't give up on the opera. The Von Karajan production is a delight!",1396915200,,1030,4.491978609625669
8002952,4,B0000TWMPC,"My wife and I had just finished watching the Metropolitan Opera HD broadcast of Falstaff that was set in the 1950s.  I wanted to contrast what we saw with something more traditional so after a full afternoon of Falstaff, this DVD occupied our evening.  The contrast between the more modern production on the huge Met Stage and this more intimate production were impressive but both productions were very satisfying.  I think musically this 1913 reconstruction was more precise; particularly the orchestra under the direction of Ricardo Muti.  I did feel that the action was a bit static at times.  However all in all this was a most satisfying version of Verdi's last opera.  The DTS sound was excellent.  The image quality was excellent.  The color palatte tended toward earth tones.  The last act in the forest was sublime.",1387065600,2,825,4.920289855072464
8002953,5,B0000TWMPC,"Never mind the one ( picky picky)  unfavorable review; almost everyone agrees that this production brings new meaning to the word
superlative. I bought  this opera a couple years ago, and could not even finish watching it; and sold here so I could buy
another opera. I didn't think it was possible to do this opera well...welllll...it's like Jim Baker's intriguing book ""I Was Wrong""!

If any of you can imagine in your mind a Fragonard painting..here it is in living color and motion. The SET is ASTOUNDING!! All you community theater people, set builders, costume seamstresses, lighting directors..pay close attention to the consummate
mastery laid out before you. Many stages are really too big!..the players look a little like hamsters in a railroad box car...and with lighting dead  flat. Scene flats, and flies from above absent in many operas, which most people dislike,leaving us feelign short changed...we want 'magic' we want to be trasnsported...NOT watch an opera in a barren deserted warehouse!

A ""chiascuro"" painting means ""light emerging from darkness"".  This requires a bonafide real artist/draftsman to pull off. Thank God we finally have such a ""Master!"" designing this production. Every camera angle, every framed shot shows off the superb lighting. and glorious color juxtapostion...backdrops a marvelous exhibition of ""trompe l'oeill"". It is astonishing to see what can be done with a tiny stage. The bottom floor looks like it holds maybe a couple hundred people, the rest stacked up like a wedding cake in the balconies. All sound technicians know that tall and narrow, like singing in the shower, is the best acoustics of all. This tallness also has ample room above the stage and for stage machinery to raise and lower the ""fly"". Every square inch is glorious to drink in...so much visual stimulation, one is likely to forget to pay attention to the music-wellllll don't do that! Focus on that music...a small orchestra with phenomenally perfect sound!!...the music obviously revealing the genius of Verdi's last opera in his late 70's...and inspiration to anyone over 60.

Barbara Frittoli is just plain  beautiful and  melifluous ; Inva Mula playing Nannetta has the most lovely soprano I have heard in years of watching and loving operas. Last but not least:  Ambrogio Maestri, actually obese, shocks and surprises with his most melifluous, pleasant Baritone..and with enormous range and startling power. It takes great humility as well as prodigious talent, I'm sure, to take on a role  of a ""despiccable me"" character, yet one the audience actually sort of likes! They all get a thunderous applause, but when Ambrogio finally comes out last, it is beyond thunderous applause...screaming with delight applause...and well deserved...WELL DONE! This is opera production mastery...It's how we like our operas done..every person involved enormously talented people.",1374969600,4,2891,5.276688453159041
8002954,5,B0000TWMPC,"There are some problems with this 2001 recreation of a 1913 production in a small theater with a reduced orchestra.  The stage does seem too crowded at times, and the business with the basket and screen perhaps especially suffers.  I also have some question about the sound -- at times the orchestra does overwhelm the microphones.  In terms of the performance itself, I thought Roberto Frontali was underpowered as Ford: he barked and was shaky at times, but he looked good and acted well.  Otherwise, I thought it was great:  Ambrogio Maestri sang and acted beautifully as Falstaff, the young lovers (Juan Diego Florez and Inva Mula) couldn't be better, Bernadette Manca Di Nissa was a splendid Quickly, and Barbara Frittoli was a wonderful Alice.  Any good performance builds to a climax, and the whole of Act 3 was magical here, from Falstaff's ""Mondo Ladro"" soliloquy through the plotting music at the end of scene 1 to the Windsor Forest scene, beautifully lit (if, again, a bit crowded) and very well sung.  Muti makes it all hang together.  It must have been a wonderful evening in the theater. I have no basis of comparison on DVD -- the 2009 Terfel sounds inviting: Frontali, Frittoli, and Manca di Nissa all reprise their roles for Haitink and Covent Garden -- but you can't miss with this.

Some reviewers are complaining about Falstaff's ""Bozo the Clown"" costuming.  I think they're missing the point.  This opera is not a profound character-study couched in terms of ""verismo"" style.  It's much closer to commedia del' arte, and Verdi has found a musical language that has the kind of comic formality to express that.  The director of this production realizes this too -- notice the discreet use of masks in a number of scenes as well as the knockabout comedy acting in places and the physical composition of the women's scenes.  Falstaff is a type of a kind of masculinity as Ford is another, and I think it's a mistake to see Ford as a watered-down Otello.  The women are all of a piece, sensible and pragmatic.  The treatment is very close to the spirit of Shakespeare's original.  Musically, the commedia del' arte formality is especially evident in the concerted women's numbers and, of course in the concluding ensemble.",1356912000,3,2240,4.821989528795812
8002955,2,B0000TWMPC,"Musically, this is a memorable performance; dramatically, it's an unmitigated disaster. The director has utterly dehumanized this great opera, reducing it to horrendously clichd routines, mechanically executed in time to the music. There's much play with parasols, lots of 'funny' walks, atrociously timed double takes, and the like, more suitable to a third-rate television sitcom than to this immortal work. Any sense that Falstaff has anything to say to us is utterly dissipated. I have rarely felt such painfully excruciating dissonance between the musical excellence of a performance and the hopeless inadequacy of the staging. I must say that Ambrogio Maestri as Falstaff, and the very young Juan Diego Florez as Fenton, are vocally as perfect for their roles as could be wished. The 1913 sets are attractive; but Falstaff's costume, and particularly his clownish topknot, make him ridiculous rather than profoundly funny - and deeply human, as he should be. This is one of my very favourite operas, and I am profoundly grieved by the shallow realization on offer here.",1347408000,,1075,5.292397660818714
8002956,5,B0000TWMPC,This is a fun Opera with lots of humor and enjoyable aria's.  The participants are good actors and singers.  It's money well spent.  I've watched and listened to it several times.  A nice change from the many 'tragic' operas.,1265068800,,225,4.6923076923076925
8002957,5,B0000TWMPC,"Falstaff, Verdi's last opera, premiered in 1893 when the composer was 80 years of age, is full of energy, the pace frenetic, yet his most stingy score with not one note superfluous.  In short, compact, a chamber piece despite the complex orchestration.

This DVD, a live performance recorded in 2001 in the small and cosy Teatro Verdi in Busseto, close to Verdi's place of birth, a century after his death, is an appropriate venue to showcase this masterpiece. Some have complained that the stage was too small, too crowded, claustrophobic.  But Falstaff is a chamber opera, and the tight setting fits admirably.

Others complain about the weak peformance of Ambrogio Maestri in the title role.  They may be more familiar with the interpretations by Valdengo, Gobbi (especially), Evans, Bruson, Terfel, Pertusi, etc..., where Falstaff's buffonery takes centre stage.  True, this performance highlghts the women, Alice (Barbara Fritolli) especially, but also Quickly (Bernadette Manca di Nissa), yet Maestri manages to hold his own.  The young lovers, Nanetta (Inva Mula) and Fenton (Juan Diego Florez) are a delightful diversion.  At the end, of course, the balance is restored.  All are winners and losers.

Ruggero Cappuccio's direction is superb.  The sets are evocative without being distracting, the characters, in period costumes, move naturally across the small stage, every facial expression, gesture, caught by the camera (thanks to Pierre Cavasillas).  No weak links.

Riccardo Muti, with a scaled-down Teatro alla Scala orchestra and chorus, produces a sparkling interpretation.

A fitting tribute to mark the centenary of the master's departure.  And his last opera, a semi-private reflection on life, in a most intimate setting.",1252713600,3,1741,5.4200743494423795
8002958,4,B0000TWMPC,"First, let me say Verdi's  Falstaff is not an opera for beginners. If you are just discovering the powerful magic in Rigoletto-Traviata-Trovatore, this opera is quite different, and perhaps you should go through the Don Carlos-Aida-Otello path before trying Falstaff.

This DVD is unique in one thing: it's a ""chamber version"", due to the reduced size of the Teatro Verdi (only 328 seats!) in Bussetto, the small town where Verdi lived his school days and always returned to, disregarding a more glamorous life in Milan or Paris. In this 2001 production, scenery and costumes were ""recreated"" from a historical performance of 1913, and, as then with Toscanini on the podium, La Scala selected forces under Riccardo Muti came to Bussetto.

So, don't expect a super-production, resounding voices, thunderous finales and deafening applause, but rather a small-is-beautiful, intimate performance of this wonderful opera. All singers are very good, women better than men indeed, the scenery and lighting is modest but tasty, the stage direction is nearly perfect and the plot is well served by all players. Highest scores goes to velvet voiced Barbara Frittoli (Alice) and the young lovers Juan Diego Florez (Fenton) and Inva Mula (Nannetta).

I've read some acid criticism on the clownish look of young Ambrogio Maestri (Falstaff), and I must agree: making ""O sweet Sir John"" look as a clown is not the wisest thing to do. Maestri was just 31 at the recording, and though he delivers a superb Falstaff vocally, he simply lacks the ""old dog"" attitude the role requires. If a seasoned Falstaff is a must for you (or Ford, or Quickly), try the Taddei-Panerai-Ludwig 1982 Salzburg  magnificent production, no matter its lesser (older) video and audio quality. Back to costumes and wigs, I think the ladies' show an exaggerated opulence, which is incoherent with the overall austerity of the production. These merry wives don't look as common Windsor Town housewives, but  they rather seem to dwell in Windsor Palace, and Alice certainly looks as ravishing as the Queen.

But these are minor complaints, and I've cut just one star for that. This DVD contains beautiful widescreen picture, excellent sound (Dolby 5ch and DTS), subtitles in English, German, French, Italian and (very good) Spanish. If , like Verdi, you have ever dreamed about seeing Falstaff represented at your home, get this one. It's close.",1248912000,3,2400,5.138461538461539
8002959,4,B0000TWMPC,"This is an acceptable rendering of a great opera.  From my perspective what keeps it from high praise is that one never believes the characters are real.  Yes, it is and should be opera buffo, but when we make characters total buffons or use extreme characterizations we lose poignance and to my mind relevance.  We are thus the less likely to watch this and see the flaws withing our own character.",1246233600,,399,4.591549295774648
