8249603,2,B0009K3J1I,I was not happy with this video. I was hoping for the instructor to be more descriptive of each exercise she presented and I would have like to see kids that knew what they were doing. It was a waste of money.,1242432000,,209,4.0

8249605,5,B0009K3J1I,"Roberta's Fitness for Kids is a great workout. It includes aerobic exercise, weight lifting using light weights(3-5 lbs.), abdominal exercises, medicine ball exercises, rubber tubing, tae-kwon-do and kickboxing. It also includes nutrition tips which is essential to a healthy diet.
  I've given a garden variety of exercises for them to choose from. They can do portions of the workout or the entire thing. It is a great way for any child to start a safe and fun exercise program. Have a happy and healthy New Year! - Roberta Bergman, ACE Certified Trainer and Group Exercise Instructor",1197504000,5,586,5.09375
