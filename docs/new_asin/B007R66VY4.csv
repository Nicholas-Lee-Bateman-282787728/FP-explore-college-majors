The red rock and warm Navajo sandstone color completely takes my mind off the rainy cold days that I can't ride outside. As the dvd description reads, you basically cycle through the best of Zion National Park and see everything it has to offer. I know the elevations in the park range from about 3,000 to 8,000 ft above sea level so in the video you're doing some climbs and descents all along the way. You also will be passing picturesque rock formations, natural arches, rivers and canyons, buttes and mesas. There is so much to see along the route that you'll finish cycling the 98 minutes before you know it and want more. I also appreciate that I don't see many cars, or tour buses and tourists as one would expect in a national park which might spoil the sight-seeing as you ride. I highly recommend this dvd and I have permission from the owner to share the youtube clip. I really enjoy all these videos and they've made my indoor workouts not work at all but a real pleasure. I've lost weight and am healthier and it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't found these videos.  http://youtu.be/Sf8XkBDYLnI?list=UUgEFJI7fpe9yP8mizL55Vpw",1363219200,,1550,5.95067264573991
