6080990,4,B00GKLV2KK,"BODY SHOP is one of the latest offerings in instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness DVD series.  Like all of the DVDs in this series, BODY SHOP offers two main workouts (each about 30 minutes in length) plus a variety of premix workout options, making it a great value.  These routines focus on strength training using dumbbells (Kelly recommends use of ""light"" and ""heavy""), but Kelly also adds in a few unweighted intervals to keep the heart rate up.  A mat is also used for the floorwork.

Kelly instructs live in a somewhat bland, industrial-looking studio (I prefer the windowed spaces of her prior videos).  She works out with four background exercisers, one of whom shows some modifications.  The options on the Main Menu are as follows:  Introduction--Body Shop Workout #1--Body Shop Workout #2--Premixes--Credits--Music On/Off.  I have described the two main workouts below.

BODY SHOP WORKOUT #1 (33 minutes)
Short warm-up (<2 minutes):
*side taps, a shoulder stretch, squats, and arm circles
One heavy dumbbell:
*1-arm row, alternating between overhand and underhand grip; 2 sets each side
*reverse lunge with rear leg lift
*combine reverse lunge with 1-arm row; 1 set
Two heavy dumbbells:
*1-arm bicep curl (two pulses, one full curl); 2 sets each side
*""suitcase"" (1-leg) deadlift; 2 sets each leg
*half-deadlift with bicep curl

*squats right-left, reach overhead
One light dumbbell:
*overhead press with side leg lift; 3 sets each side
*1-arm triceps kickback; 3 sets each side plus one ""running"" set
No weights:
*""hurdle"" steps (large hydrant lunge)
Floorwork (at 24.5 minutes):
*pullovers/flies; 3 sets of each, with knee-ins in-between
*1-leg hip lifts; 3 sets plus 1 set pulsing
Stretch (2 minutes):
*seated stretches for side, neck, and arms; finish standing

BODY SHOP WORKOUT #2 (31 minutes)
Kelly starts here by introducing her crew:  Michele (shows modifications), Marcus, Lori, and Samantha
Warm-up (about 1.5 minutes):
*arm circles, slow squats, side stretch, rear lunge, side squats
Two heavy dumbbells:
*overhead lat pull down/wide-legged plie; 2 sets each
*combine for alternating pull-down/plie; 1 set

One light dumbbell:
*1-arm side lateral raise with arm to knee; 3 sets
*1-arm triceps overhead press with forward lunge to opposite knee twist; 3 sets
*1-arm triceps overhead press; 1 set plus 1 set pulsing
No weights:
*large knee steps from side-to-side
Floorwork:
*alternate hand push-ups; 3 sets plus 1 set hover push-ups
*on all 4s with weights behind knees, bent leg raises; 3 sets plus 1 set pulsing
*abs: alternating knee-ins (3 sets), bicycles, uppers/lowers (3 sets)
Stretch (3 minutes):
*Figure 4 stretch on floor, seated hamstring and side stretch, cobra and pigeon, finish standing for upper body and neck stretches

As noted, this DVD also offers many premix options, nine total.  Here is how they appear on the Premix menu:

Combined Body Shop Workouts 1 & 2 61:30
Chest, Glutes & Abs 18:11
Lower Body Shop 18:17
Split Body Shop (Back, Biceps & Legs) 23:31
Split Body Shop (Shoulders & Triceps) 16:21
Upper Body Shop 32:26
Fast Track (Compound Moves Only) 17:35
Workout 1 (Less Compound Moves) 30:40
Workout 2 (Less Compound Moves) 28:58

Kelly's premixes vastly increase the usability of her DVDs.  For example, although I didn't like the second workout as much as the first here (I thought that the floorwork dragged on too long), I know that I will still use this DVD often, as I have plenty of alternative workout options in the premixes.  I used 10-lb. dumbbells as my ""heavy"" weights in these workouts, and I found that these were definitely heavy enough, especially for the multiple sets.  (I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser.)  For the ""light"" weights, I used 5-lb. in the first workout and thought I could go a bit heavier, so I tried 8-lb. in the second workout; some people might want three sets of weights to find what's exactly right for them.

Overall, I enjoyed these workouts and am glad to have this DVD.  There are a few things I found a bit odd.  For example, it seems like Workout #2 may have been intended as the first workout, as that's when Kelly introduces her background exercises.  I also thought that Kelly was a bit remiss with the warm-ups:  although I don't mind short warm-ups, I think that some brief cardio to truly warm the body would have been more appropriate than the more stretching-type moves which Kelly includes.  Despite these minor issues, I would recommend this DVD, particularly for intermediate exercisers and beyond.",1373932800,16,4718,5.048969072164948
6080991,5,B00GKLV2KK,This DVD consists of two main workouts each about 30 minutes plus 9 premixes from 16 to 62 minutes in length. You may think that it is strictly weight work but she throws in a cardio interval here and there which makes this so efficient and satisfying as a total body workout. You can go heavy and it feels great. I love Kelly's matter-of-fact excellent cueing and music selection.,1371427200,3,381,4.536231884057971
6080992,5,B00GKLV2KK,"I have several of KCM's DVDs.  They are all good in my opinion.  What I like about this one is that it really targets every part of your body. Lots of upper body work - biceps, triceps, chest work, back work.  Lots of compound moves.  Lots of leg work, squats, lunges.  It just has everything and she does a lot of reps so that I really feel like I am burning that muscle out.  The variety is good and I am not bored yet - I have done this workout probably 7-8 times thus far.  The ONLY thing that could be better is the music.  It is very cheesy.  I guess I can just workout at this point with my headphones on since I already know the routines.  Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do!",1431475200,6,679,4.0
6080993,5,B00GKLV2KK,Great voice to listen too. First time with DVD for weights. She is just great,1429228800,,77,4.2
6080994,4,B00GKLV2KK,"This DVD has two 30-minute full body strength workouts. The moves are generally traditional exercises with some twists to help achieve certain goals with the moves. Upper body muscle groups are superset with lower body exercises and then followed up with a compound move to further challenge the muscles being worked. In each of the two workouts she approaches the major muscle groups in different ways and you can do them individuall or use the premix that combines them into one workout to hit everything.

For these workouts Kelly tells you to have a set of heavy and a set of light dumbbells. You may want a wider variety than just two sets of dumbbells. You may have a conflict with some of the compound exercises because you can go much heavier on one of the exercises than the other.

The premixes let you customize this workout. Don't like compound moves? Do that premix? Think 30 minutes isn't long enough? Do a longer premix. I would classify the two workouts as intermediate to high intermediate/low advanced which you can make more difficult by increasing the weight of your dumbbells or doing a more intense premix.

Instructor Comments:
Kelly is fun and encouraging in this workout. There is a modifier.",1425427200,10,1217,4.813397129186603
6080995,5,B00GKLV2KK,"Good, effective workout in 30 minutes. I like that I can also customize my workouts in the menu. I bought 3 KCM DVD's at the same time based on some reviews of them that I read on a forum and I am glad that I did!",1421625600,3,213,3.652173913043478
6080996,5,B00GKLV2KK,Body Shop is an excellent total body workout at home within an hour total for both sections.  The exercises flow well and overall the workout is enjoyable.,1419984000,4,155,4.7407407407407405

6081000,5,B00GKLV2KK,"Full body workout in 30-minutes.  I love that this video targets every body part and can be done with light weights, heavy weights, or no weights - can easily be adjusted for all fitness levels",1407456000,,193,4.514285714285714
6081001,5,B00GKLV2KK,Kelly has become my new go to for a quick and efficient workout.  I have several of her DVD's now and have not been disappointed in any of them so far.  I think Body Shop may be my favorite.  It does a very nice job of covering all the bases in a short amount of time.,1400544000,7,268,3.75
6081002,5,B00GKLV2KK,I love this dvd. I found it very challenging and i was sore in all the right places! This instructor is the best i've ever had as far as workout dvd's. I highly recommend this one if you love toning and working out with dumbells.,1398211200,,229,4.111111111111111
6081003,5,B00GKLV2KK,"This was my very first dvd by Kelly Coffey and after using it once,I quickly ordered several more of her workouts. I have been an at home excerciser for many years and had became bored with my collection of Jillian,Jari Love,Jackie Warner,etc. Kelly has many innovative excercises in her dvds and I get excited once again for my workouts! I prefer her strength dvds to her Cardio,as I am very uncoordinated and her cardio moves tend to move too fast for me. Besides this dvd,I also love Muscle Definition,Plateau Buster ,NYC&Circuit Burn. I also love that Kelly is close to my age and looks amazing-I hate working out to trainers who are so young and look like Barbie dolls,as I feel like I can't ever aspire to look like them! This workout really made me a fan of Kelly!",1393200000,26,771,4.553956834532374
6081004,3,B00GKLV2KK,"I work out to Cathe, Jillian and sometimes Kelly.  I like Kelly but sometimes feel its not enough and moves too slow for intermediate or advanced.  I will most likely keep it and use it on ""down"" days or for a change.  I can say though that I enjoy Kelly's ""30 minutes"" approach to fitness.  It goes by quick and actually IS an ok workout...just not one of my daily go to's.",1391040000,3,374,4.152777777777778
6081005,4,B00GKLV2KK,"I love KCM's workouts and have many that I return to again and again. Sadly, ""Body Shop"" is not one of them. It's not bad; it's pretty good, I just don't enjoy it as much as the others. I prefer KCM's ""Your Best Body"" for total body strength training.",1391040000,,251,4.142857142857143
6081006,5,B00GKLV2KK,"I started working out in September after not having worked out for 4 years.  I started with Kelly's Fitness Start Here.  I loved that so much, I decided to get some of her other DVD's.  This is definitely more challenging than the first one.  It gets my heart rate up.  I've only done the first routine.  This routine requires sets of light and heavy weights.  I use 5 and 7-pound weights.  She alternates between arms, legs, and combination moves.  I like this style, because my muscles get rest without stopping.  She has one person showing a lower-impact version of the moves.  She demonstrates the moves before having you follow.  So, you can follow starting at count 1.  The cardio warm-up is included in the routine rather than as a separate menu item.  Unlike the weight routine, I didn't like her cues in the warm-up.  She didn't demonstrate beforehand, and I wasn't familiar with the moves she mentioned.  So, the first few times, I struggled during the transitions.",1386201600,,975,4.748502994011976
6081007,4,B00GKLV2KK,"I consider myself at an intermediate advanced level of fitness.

I like this instructor and have tried most of her other workouts.  This one was not one of my favorites.  The music was on the quiet side and made the workout seem a little quiet and dull with no consistent beat to follow (but sometimes that is better than music I just don't really like so this is preferable.)

Having said that, the productions values were good, instructor cued well, the backup exercisers non-annoying, as always.  The first workout was easier than the second, often working one arm at a time instead of both at once.  The second workout was a little more challenging.  The moves were fine but overall a little too easy for me.  I would have to up my usual weights to get a better workout with this number of reps and difficulty.  Generally, I prefer cardio between reps but this one was not that style of workout.

Depending on your level and preferences, this workout was decent.",1378857600,5,966,4.5964912280701755
6081008,5,B00GKLV2KK,"This is my first KCM video and I love it.  She works out the whole body in 30 min and she challenges you to use heavier weights.  There is a slight cardio effect to this workout as well.  KCM has a friendly, encouraging demeanor.  A definite keeper for me.",1378166400,3,256,4.163265306122449
6081009,5,B00GKLV2KK,"I was looking for something that was broken down into 30 minute ALL BODY workouts, not just focusing on one particular area of the body.  This dvd gives two such workouts.  Perfect for someone just starting out.",1376697600,,211,4.675675675675675
6081010,3,B00GKLV2KK,"It's a good workout nothing to crazy . If you need a quick workout
This is a good one  for  beginner , intermediate . It's certainly not
Advanced but you could certainly increase the weights if you want to.",1376179200,2,206,4.256410256410256
6081011,5,B00GKLV2KK,"I won't break down the workout here because I see another reviewer has that covered.  However, I want to add another voice of praise for this video.

Kelly is my favorite video fitness instructor - by far.  She's upbeat, has great cuing, and provides an intelligent and solid workout in 30 minutes.  I had a very difficult time sticking to a workout routine until I found her 30-minutes-to-fitness series.  Her videos have changed my life.

Back to this particular video... Body Shop provides 2 30-minute total-body strength training workouts with a variety of premixes available.  I love both workouts and they've become part of my regular rotation.  As usual, there is a modifier in her crew so if you feel that any move is too rough on a knee or a hip, you can follow the modifier.  If you are a beginner, you grab light weights and follow the modifier.  If you are advanced, you grab heavy weights and follow Kelly.

It's hard for me to judge the individual exercises because I don't have enough knowledge in physiology to make assessments like that.  But, I will say that I've been using Kelly's 30-minutes-to-fitness videos consistently for over a year and the changes in my body (shape, strength and endurance) have been remarkable.  And, the fact that I've been able to stay with an exercise routine, even while moving out-of-state, says a lot about the likeability of Kelly and how she manages to keep the fun-factor in her workouts.

For those that already are familiar with Kelly's work, you will not be disappointed.  She's done it again!",1375315200,18,1550,4.774436090225564

8624098,3,B00GKLV2KK,"First off, I love KCM. I own 6 of her workout DVDs, this one being the seventh. This is not a total body workout. Mainly, all you're working is your arms, and legs. No ab work, no cardio whatsoever, and a little bit of glute work thrown in at the end. It would be ideal if all I were looking for was strength training. But when the title says Total Body, I expect a total body workout. Nevertheless, Kelley is still a good trainer.",1500076800,,431,4.142857142857143
8624099,5,B00GKLV2KK,"Love this DVD. I have done both workouts back to back 3 times since receiving my order and it kicked my butt. I find doing both  ensures a thorough workout, but doing one 30 minute workout on days when time is limited will work too. Haven't tried the other pre mixes on the disc though. Kelly is fun, encouraging and not annoying. Her moves are creative which is a great break from the routine of Jari Love DVDs.
