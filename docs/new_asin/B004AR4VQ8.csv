4310912,4,B004AR4VQ8,I bought this for my friends daughter. She loves Dinosaur train and will watch it again and again. Jim Henson creative.,1316908800,2,119,4.714285714285714
4310913,4,B004AR4VQ8,"The DVD is a request from my nephews who are three and five for CHristmas. It looks like what they wanted, so we shall see.",1316908800,,123,3.96
4310914,5,B004AR4VQ8,"If your kids love Dinosaur Train, or even just dinosaurs, they'll love this show.  It can be watched as a full-length movie with a cohesive theme (a train journey with several overnights), or as four episodes, each with two parts.  In each episode, we learn about a new dinosaur or pterosaur, but there are other many other things to learn as well; What is a carnivore? Do all theropods walk on two feet? What are spikes and spines for? What is a herd? What kind of animals are awake during the night?  This DVD also deals with issues that aren't species specific - losing a beloved toy, playing Go Fish, having a hard time sleeping in a new place, making friends, etc.  Nearly every minute of the show is packed with learning.

As far as the ""World Tour"" goes, kids aren't going to be learning geography from this.  Adults will pick up on the accents of dinosaurs, and other hints about location (White Cliffs) but the Time Tunnel and other imaginary devices make it too confusing too much real information to come through.  Also, the Earth looked different during the Cretaceous period, as you'll see in the pictures.

It is a bummer that Dr. Scott isn't in this DVD.  Normally the episodes have shorts, skits, and Dr. Scott's informative scenes inserted between each episode half.  This one has credits between the episodes, and PBSkids.org ads, but nothing else.

Episodes and new dinosaurs:
Pteranodon Family World Tour (Amargasaurus, Giganotosaurus)
Gilbert the Junior Conductor (Troodon, Argentinosaurus)
Confuciusornis Says (Confuciusornis)
Tiny's Tiny Doll (Velociraptor, Zhejiangopterus)
Iggy Iguanodon (Iguanodon)
Shiny Can't Sleep (nocturnal creatures)
Kenny Kentrosaurus (Kentrosaurus, Lesothosaurus)
Don and the Troodons (learn how to play Go Fish!)",1311552000,26,1763,5.172535211267606
4310915,5,B004AR4VQ8,"My son watches dinosaur train over and over.  My only complaint is that Doctor Scott didn't make the DVD.  If you kid(s) love dinosaur train, they will love this DVD",1310342400,3,165,4.466666666666667
4310916,5,B004AR4VQ8,"My little man is into a lot of things. He loves pretend play, acting like a soldier, playing with cars, but he really likes dinosaurs, especially the popular PBS Kids show Dinosaur Train! I knew this movie would be a big hit. When the DVD arrived, I couldn't press play fast enough for him!

4310931,4,B004AR4VQ8,"This is my 2.5 yo daughter's favorite tv show in DVD form. I love that it's not annoying, and the characters a are all entertaining and have personalities. I also appreciate that my daughter is never ""scared"" of this show. (She doesn't like the dark scene in other tv shows or movies, so we have to skip all the hyena parts in the Lion King & only watch about 20 minutes of that.)
I can't figure out how to make all the episodes play at one time. We bought the dvd for long car trips so she won't get bored after we run out of books/music and other non-tv car things that a 2yo can do, so it would be great if we didn't have to press play every 25 or so minutes.",1420416000,,662,3.9849624060150375

It does a great job of actually teaching all the types of dinosaurs and lots of facts about them. We love all the characters and the fun songs too!

4310966,5,B004AR4VQ8,"My daughter is almost 2 and has loved Dinosaur Train for about a year now. The Pteranodon Family Adventure is one of my personal favorites. The family goes on a ""World Tour"" where they travel to different continents to meet and learn about different creatures and their habitats.  This particular disc does not have the Dr Scott segment under Special Features like some other titles, but it is still entertaining and somewhat educational.
As a Prime subscriber, I'm always amazed at how quickly these discs arrive. Though I select to use my free two day shipping option, they are often delivered before noon the day after I order. This is always a pleasant surprise for me and my daughter! We've ordered several different Dinosaur Train titles and haven't had any problems with the discs or delivery.
Overall I can't complain about the price or quality of the item. We love Dinosaur Train, PBS, and Amazon!",1366502400,,906,4.84516129032258

8420722,2,B004AR4VQ8,"My kids love Dinosaur Train, so we bought the DVD hoping to bring it on trips with us and to have if our tivo ever crashes. Unfortunately, the DVD has no Dr. Scott parts. If your kids won't care, then this will be fine for you Mine, like most toddlers and small children, will not be happy. When they want to watch Dinosaur Train, they want the show as they have come to see it on tv, and completely missing Dr. Scott is just going to throw them all off. It isn't even worth the meltdown to show it to them. unfortunately, we couldn't possibly have known that the Dr. Scott parts were not there until opening the package, so now I get the joy of seeing if I can return this even though it is open. Otherwise I just bought a very expensive coaster.",1437264000,3,747,4.158620689655172
