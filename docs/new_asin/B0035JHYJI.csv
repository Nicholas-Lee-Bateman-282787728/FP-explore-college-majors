4070777,4,B0035JHYJI,I thought it was a very good product and enjoyed all three movies. The Sackets and Conagher could have been done in wide screen or the same as Catlow as if when you compare them to the VHS tapes they cut out some of the scenes at the edges of the picture.,1295740800,7,255,3.923076923076923
4070778,5,B0035JHYJI,"5 Stars..... goes to This Western Movie The Sacketts by L'Amour it still is one of the Best movies to add to your Western Collection. If your hero's are cowboys you won't be disappointed with this line up of well known actors. Its got plenty of action, a good wholesome story all done up in style. This movie The Sacketts comes as a 2 disk DVD in the  L'Amour s collection which also includeds 2 additional separate feature movies Conagher and Catlow that I personally did not care for However, The Sacketts staring Sam Elliott and Tom Sellick is on of their best done up Western movies around. See for yourself rent it before you purchase you too will agree its one of thee Best Cowboy Westerns this side of the Pacos...",1295136000,2,721,4.462121212121212
4070779,4,B0035JHYJI,I ordered these movies for my husband (51) for Christmas.  He has enjoyed watching them so much he has passed them onto his dad and brothers.,1294704000,3,141,4.423076923076923
4070780,5,B0035JHYJI,"The Sacketts is the quintessentiall western staring two of the best western actors of this generation. It has all the ingredients ,brothers who fight for right justice and love. And to help open up the south-west.the acting is realistic and directing and casting is also very good. Amazons service is with out peer. Sam Elliot& Tom Selleck carry the story with Ben Johnson and Jeff Osterhage. I believe it deserves 5 stars as does Amazon.",1293753600,12,438,4.8533333333333335
4070781,3,B0035JHYJI,"I initially purchased this collection to get a copy of the Sacketts but after watching all the 3 films I find it is the weaker. Conagher was for me the strongest of the offerings with Catlow a surprising second. I remember years ago catching a glimpse of Catlow on TV. I was not excited by the 50's looking hat worn by our russian friend, Mr. Brynner. So I was not inclined to watch further. That was my mistake. Perhaps it is my aging but Catlow was a very entertaining film, carried well by Richard Crenna and by Yul's great laugh. Leonard Nimoy's bad guy roll was credible. Conagher was most successful in giving a true L'amour experience. L'amour's moral sense makes itself well evident in this well acted and strong tale of life, strength and loneliness. Sam Elliot was a more mature rough guy with a heart. The Sacketts showed its TV age. It would have been better if it had been longer and the relationships and the diverse transecting events were allowed to breathe. It still was enjoyable, tho' dated. As a DVD compilation of L'amour films it is worth the surprisingly low price. I give this package 3.5 stars, 4 for Conagher, 3 for Catlow, and 2.5 for The Sacketts.",1292457600,56,1175,4.547169811320755
4070782,5,B0035JHYJI,"I purchased these movies for my husband because he is an avid western fan.  And although I do not share his love for this type of genre, I am glad that he was pleased to receive these movies for his birthday.  I would like to say that as always, Amazon.com is a quality supplier and I am not hesitant to purchase anything that is sold by this company.  I must admit that I expected the movies to arrive at a later date because I did not order them until September 2, 2010; however, the movies arrived at our house on September 8, 2010 (my husband's birthday)!",1286323200,3,559,4.254716981132075

One of the best westerns ever made.
When you watch it, you'll agree - but I kinda never likes the very end. I can only assume It follows the book ending . . .
I also already had the Sacketts on DVD so I gave that copy to my daughter - The Sacketts (& Shadow Riders) are both great westerns and fun.
Catlow is a pretty good 'classic' western - it's worth watching Brenner altho' the accent throws you - I try to imagine he as an oriental laundry owner turned outlaw - I think it woulda been a good back-story for the character . . .  lol

So, two of these movies are great.
But, the third, ""Catlow"", was not very good at all.  I have read the book so I and know the storyline.  But, the movie didn't work for me.  And I think the reason is, is because the main character is played by Yul Brynner.  He doesn't fit.  A Russian (although he did claim to be Mongolian, he was actually Russian) accent is too distracting on an Old West Cowboy.

Conagher: Store of a man and a widow and her kids (not as mushy as it sounds, lots of action.

Catlow: Yul Brenner and Richard Crenna in a lighthearted western about two friends on each side of the law and a caper about 2 million dollars in Confederate gold. (male nudity)Lenard Ninoy in the heavy (and does a nude scene)

4070941,5,B0035JHYJI,what more is there to say- Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot- really enjoyed all three movies,1410652800,,86,4.4375
4070942,2,B0035JHYJI,"This set has one pretty good movie and two pretty bad ones.  The good one is Conagher, it has some good acting a decent script and nice sets.  It is more thoughtful than many westerns with Sam Elliot.  He actually does a decent job in this one.
Catlow has to be someones idea of a joke, Bryner is such a ham and the rest of the cast seems to be phoning it in, a total waste of time.
The biggest disappointment was The Sacketts, first let me say that I have all of Lamour's books and have read and enjoyed them for years.  Yes he is repetitive and formulaic and his hero's never lose and are always the fastest, toughest and can take any punishment and come out swinging but they are good short stories and easy to read.  The Sackett's film is based on 2 different books and they have tried to mingle the 2 stories together to make one film.  Nice try but it didn't work.  The script is laughable, the acting is wooden and totally unbelievable and the pacing is a joke as it keeps skipping back and forth between the 2 plots.
I will keep the set because of Conagher but will never watch the other 2 again, if you can get it cheap enough give it a try but don't expect much in the way of entertainment.",1410480000,,1200,4.146551724137931

4070960,5,B0035JHYJI,These movies can be counted among the classics.  The stars are wonderful and memorable.  Louis L'Amour should be proud of how the movies turned out.  His books are awesome and so are the movie adaptations.,1400198400,,205,4.8

4070965,4,B0035JHYJI,Catlow is mediocre.  Selleck is great in the Sacketts.  Sam Elliot is at his best in  Conagher.  Conagher is the gem in this collection.  Great plot with real characters that are not cartoonish like the characters in Catlow.  These are a good addition to my westerns collection.,1396137600,,278,4.808510638297872
4070966,4,B0035JHYJI,"They could have eliminated "" Catlow "" from this & put another Selleck movie in it's place.  Conager was pretty good.  Not a whole lot of shoot-em up like other westerns.  And "" The Sacketts "" will be one of the better western films, in my opinion.
  It's just an enjoyable film to watch.  Great script & acting by all.",1395878400,,318,4.216666666666667

4070975,3,B0035JHYJI,"The presentation was weak. The best was Gonagher. The worst was Catlow---I could not get through it. The Sacketts was OK, at best. That's it. I can't recommend it.",1390953600,,163,4.655172413793103

4071011,4,B0035JHYJI,Sacketts is a stand-alone five star film. Conager is a four star. Catlow was a disappointment - had never heard of it and now know why.,1367107200,,135,4.230769230769231

4071014,5,B0035JHYJI,"Elliot's love and appreciation for L'Amour comes through. I especially like Conagher as this movie presents a more realistic side of what the old West was like. Elliott's character portrays high morals and ethics and provides a contrast to his antagonists. I understand that this movie was the project of Elliott and his wife, Katherine Ross, who co-stars in the movie. The Sacketts is purely L'Amour, a bit too much ""we are the best"" but done with adventure. Catlow is a lighthearted Western pitting two friend/rival men in a game of cat and mouse. These movies are fun and entertaining.",1365811200,,588,4.89

4071017,5,B0035JHYJI,"We loved the Sackett Series of books by Louis L'Amour.  The DVD ""The Sacketts"" stayed close to the way the story was written.  Sam Elliot personifies the old West.

I only wish I could find every book made into a movie and Sam and Tom would be in every one that their character was written in.",1361836800,,328,3.838235294117647
4071024,4,B0035JHYJI,"The Sackett family stories are L'Amour's best known work, and this was a first-rate representation.  Conagher is a bit more obscure, but one of his better romances.  Sam Elliott shines in both, although Tom Selleck seems just a bit less capable than usual.  Still, if you've read L'Amour, you'll appreciate these respectful, modest deliveries by actors who obviously love the stories they're telling.  All I'll say about Catlow is that if they did a re-make, it would likely star Bruce Willis.",1361577600,,493,5.049382716049383

4071040,3,B0035JHYJI,"Loved the Sacketts book series many years ago. Louis L'Amour wrote prolific good, action packed, simple ""good v bad"" westerns; actually the same western with different titles most of the time. I really liked the ""Crossfire Trail"" dvd and tried these on a whim. ""The Sacketts"" is good, ""Conagher"" is a quiet, gentle, character driven tale, and ""Catlow"", which had the most potential as the funniest, action packed novel of the three, is poor. It should have been much lighter and comedic, but is just bland, wooden, and episodic. Still a really cheap price, one good film (Sacketts) one gentle but forgettable film (Conagher) and one poor film (Catlow), made more disappointing if you enjoyed the book. Basically simple westerns and a fair deal.",1348963200,,744,5.008064516129032

4071042,5,B0035JHYJI,"I'm a big fan of the late Louis L'Amour. I bought and read 24 of his novels, 3 short story collections, 4 non western books and his first book of poems. Almost all 5 stars.... see my reviews. Louis L'Amour was one of America's great authors and INMO was much more than a Western writer.

Louis L'Amour's 3 movie DVD collection on 4 DVDs was spectacular. The best DVD Western collection I ever bought. The color and sound were great. The scene selection worked great on the DVDs.

The back of the DVD box says it better than I could. Here goes.

The Sacketts
""Tom Selleck, Sam Elliot and Jeff Osterhage play brothers who migrate west to make their fortunes in cattle herding and gold prospecting. Each aims to make it on his own, but each also stands up for the other when the going gets tough. And their guns blaze a name for themselves in untamed New Mexico territory.""

A great movie on 2 DVDs, lots of action,great acting and a great plot...5 stars

Conagher
""He conquered the range. She conquered his heart. Sam Elliot and Katherine Ross star as a cowhand and a widowed ranch owner who draw to each other when ruthless rustlers threaten his livelihood and her homestead.""

Lots of emotion in this movie. Great fight scene, great acting and plot. I really cheered for Conagher and had deep empathy for the widow...5 stars

Catlow
""A renegade outlaw wants to pull off a gold heist but finds it hard because he's such a wanted man, by the Mexican Army, his hellcat girlfriend, an Indian war party, a vengeful killer and several hotheaded cowpokes from his former gang. Yul Brynner, Richard Crenna and Leonard Nimoy star.""

Yul Brynner as the outlaw Catlow and Leonard Nimoy as the killer were great. Richard Creena as the Marshal and Catlow's friend acted great.... but his part INMO had him doing too many bumbling scenes and made to look foolish too many times. A few times would of been OK but too many bumbling parts. I'm not knocking his acting just the way his part was wrote for the movie. Still a great movie...4 1/2 stars

Total 5 stars and the best western DVD collection I have ever watched and proudly added to our family DVD library.",1330905600,23,2147,4.541450777202073

For such good movies as The Sacketts and Conagher,the collection deserves a better third movie.  Usually Yul Brenner movies are pretty good, but we were disappointed with Catlow.",1325548800,3,347,5.035087719298246

You can't get much better for a cowboy than Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott.  I am glad to add this fine collection

4071054,5,B0035JHYJI,"I have watched these 4 movies in this collection just about every night since I bought them. Not only do you get Sam Elliot, Tom Selleck, Jeff, Ben Johnson, also you get Kathryn Ross. Three brothers as close as brothers should be, a good friend, and a woman as pretty as can be. It takes you in so different places, the when you think one of them sure could use help,it brings another into the puzzle. And all together they fight all kinds of bad men who like to contest them to see if they really are men true to the bone. Oh boy are they. They will have you on the edge of your seats, thinking nothing can get worse, and oh no trouble again. You will not lack intertainment out of these movies, I don't want to tell you the end before the beginning, so my advice is get on your computer, and order this collection, you'll never be bored. ACTION, Action, and pure pleasure......",1300233600,25,879,4.269461077844311
