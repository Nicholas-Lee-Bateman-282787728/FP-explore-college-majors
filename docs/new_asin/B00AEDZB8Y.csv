5410365,2,B00AEDZB8Y,"This long, tedious diatribe is delivered by a white-bearded ex-Satanist occultist, who apparently converted to being a Christian in some kind of church and has decided that Masons worship Baal, a pagan god from ancient Palestine. The thesis of the director, Mr. Black, is that Freemasons take blood oaths at the altar of Baal and thereby unwittingly open themselves up to invasion by demons.  How he arrives at the conclusion that the altar of Masonry (which is in fact not a religious altar of any kind) is dedicated to Baal includes making connections to the mythology of Isis and Osiris.  Because part of that myth is that Osiris could not be ressurrected by Isis when he was killed and dismembered by Set (his evil brother), he became Lord of the Underworld.  Therefore, he is Satan in Christian terms.  Osiris is missing his phallus which could never be found, though the rest of him was reconstructed.  Nevertheless, according to Mr. Black and his Satanist friend, this all becomes about ""solar-phallic"" worship.  All obelisks are phallic symbols.  So are pillars and columns.  The Washington Monument is the biggest phallic symbol in the world and that is why Americans are turning away from Christianity -- because Satan is being channeled by Freemasons through their lodge room altars.

It is true that in Scottish Rite Freemasonry and some other so-called ""high degree"" orders, the degrees invite the candidate to open his mind to other religions and develop an attitude of religious freedom and toleration.  Some of the Scottish Rite degrees might freak out a devout Christian because of their ""pagan"" images.  But Scottish Rite Freemasonry is not actually a part of Craft Masonry as taught and practiced in lodges.  The three degrees of the Symbolic Lodge use stonemasons' tools as symbols of moral lessons to teach men to focus on virtue not vice.  The symbolic penalties of the degrees, which the makers of this film call ""blood oaths"" do sound grisly, but they are intended as symbols -- just as everything in Masonry is a symbol or an allegory.  It is true that this is a different set of symbols and allegories -- different from Christian symbols and allegoires and differetn from any other religion, yet fundamentally never ""against"" anyone's religion, so long as it upholds virtue.

That the speaker in this film and apparently its originator William Schnoebelen, used to be a Satanist occultist and practicing that ""religion"" joined a Masonic Lodge speaks very poorly of that Lodge's investigation team.  It is true that Masons are not to exclude men of any good religion, but that means mostly Christians in America, along with a few Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists.  You can even be a Deist like Thomas Jefferson (though he was not a Mason).  But no lodge would be likely to openly admit a Satanist.  A Pagan practicing Wicca might possibly pass, but that is an essentially dualist religion without a ""supreme being.""  On the other hand, if your supeme being is the Earth Mother or Gaia, that would probably be close enough.  Supreme Being is defined as a Father-figure in Masonry and all people as brothers.

The arguments in this film are drawn from quoting scripture passages, most of which seem benign enough, except the one that is used most centrally.  Taking the quotation that compares the Kingdom of Heaven to leaven in bread, Mr. Schnoebelen, turns its meaning upside down and claims that the verse is telling us that sin is leaven which spreads ""like a virus.""  Jesus said that a little bit of the Kingdom could spread and grown within the person, like leaven in bread.  It does not therefore puff one up with pride, as Mr. Schnoebelen says, but rather fills one with the Spirit.  That seems like a pretty obvious interpretation of the metaphor to me.

On the Masonic side, the use of sources is very slipshod.  Quoting Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma is always what anti-masons have done in the 20th century because Pike was such a major figure in the Scottish Rite and is, frankly, rather idolized. He did teach religious toleration and sometimes seems to have felt that pious Christains were worshipping Mamon and hate rather than the benevolent God of Light and Love.  His crack about Lucifer meaning ""the light bringer"" was probably intended to imply that the use of that name by Christians shows their ignorance of what it means.  In any case, nothing in the Scottish Rite ever suggests that one should worship Satan or Lucifer or channel demons to gain ""energy.""

The suggestion that Masons are child molesters is grotesque and highly offensive to any Mason.  The suggestion that Masonry is a ""solar-phallic"" cult would shock them and probably send them rolling on the floor laughing. The old ""solar-phallic"" cult interpretation of pagan religions was discredited decades ago.  Pike might have believed it, but whoop-dee-doo.  He was one Mason.  Albert Pike does not have the authority to speak for all Masons and he himself says so at the begining of Morals and Dogma.  The book is not some sort of ""Masonic Bible.""  In fact few Masons can manage to read it because it is so turgid.  Still, it contains a lot of wisdom from a 19th century genius and polymath.  True, he did quote Eliphas Levi, the famous French occultist, but Levi was not suggesting that anyone worship the Devil either.  His picture of Baphomet was something weirdly symbolic of the union of opposites, but no more.  What more is needed?

Manly P. Hall, who is cited repeatedly as ""the greatest Masonic philosopher"" was not a Mason when he wrote about paganism and the occult traditions of the West.  His book ""The Secret Teachings  of All Ages"" was published when he was about twenty-five and he did not become a Freemason until he was an old man.  So, calling him a Masonic philosopher is a bit misleading.  He wrote about Freemasonry alongside the Ancient Mystery Schools and other ancient religions or wisdom traditions because he was recommending Wisdom, not because he was recommending anyone worship Baal or a Phallus, or even the Sun.  He did live in California, however, so that might make him suspect.

The anecdotal stories of a woman in the Order of the Eastern Star having dreams about Baphomet sounds convincing but, alas, anecdotes cannot be used as proof of anything, and it is a logical fallacy to generalize from them.  Mr. Schnoebelen's claim to have counseled ""over and over and over"" children and grandchildren abused by their Masonic relatives also holds no water without proof, and even if it was factual would not allow one to generalize to all Masons.  Some Masons do bad things.  Masonry has no control over the behavior of its members -- only the influence of spending time with other men dedicated to virtue and truth.

The Shriner who they interview who says he is ""pure and innocent"" and worships Lucifer (or whatever he is saying) must have been either drunk or messing with the annoying evangelists.  He does not sound like a particlarly well-versed Bible Scholar, but that is actually pretty typical of most Christians, I should think.  It is a hard book to read or study because it is so full of disjointed stories from different periods of history, most of which are fiction or personal revelations, not facts.  Much like Pike's massive tome.

In the end, Mr. Schnoebelen (does he realize he has ""Bel"" in the middle of his name?) and Mr. Dark claim that to get yourself free of the Masons and Saved, you have to have a formal Divorce from Baal, burn all your Masonic regalia and bling, and renounce your oaths.  I find it very suspicious that these people who are so against swearing oaths think that renouncing oaths is good.  It's a very odd worldview they have, of demons and evil spirits who will enter your soul and plague your family with learning disabilities should you join the Masonic Fraternity.

The reality, from my own personal experience, is quite different.  I was raised Christian and am a practicing Druid.  I don't think these two sets of beliefs are mutually exclusive, but that is because I do not believe in Church dogma and I don't believe everything in the Bible accurately repressents the real teachings of Yeshua.  There is no way to get a single unified answer out of the Bible.  Every one of the thousands of original manuscripts of the Christian scriptures are copies made decades or centuries after the events they purportedly describe.  The gospels all contradict each other, or repeat things taken from earler documents of dubious reliability.  But it would be pointless to make that observation to the makers of this film.  They are believers who believe that God speaks to them (or excuse me, YHVH, since the word ""god"" is too generic for them).

Masons, on the whole do not believe God speaks to them with personal revelations.  Nobody believes that the Great Architect of the Universe is Satan or Baal or Osiris.  The only World-Creator god in the Western civilization was the one taken from the Jews and their myths.  Who thinks Satan created the world?  No one that I know of.  Some Christians believe Satan is the Ruler of the material worlld, but that is hardly the same as being the Grand Architect of the Universe.  So equating them is absurd.  Not, however, as laughable as claiming that the name Hiram actually is code for ""High Ram"" presumably in a sheep cult rather than a goat cult.  Maybe he means mountain sheep which are sometimes mistakenly called ""goats.""  As the High Priests of the Jews used a ram's horn to trumpet their jubilees, it seems a bit odd to associate common livestock with the Prince of Evil.  Do they really beleive Satan looks like the Baphomet drawing or the picture on the Tarot card?

Since Mr. Schnoebelen (Belenus is another form of this Sun-god's name, among the Celts) used to be a Satanist, I suspect he might believe that Satan literally looks like half man,half goat, or half woman, half man, two thirds goat -- or something.  Why?  Because he no doubt studied the medieval demonology textbooks like the Goetia or Lemegeton, which has charming descriptions of some quite grotesque demons.  Yet, most of the princes an dukes of Hell are actually very attractive, according to the writers of such books.

Freemasonry rose out of the Age of Reason and the European Enlightenment. The men of that time were sometimes interested in Kabbalah and alchemy, and even the ancient pagans (meaning most often the Greeks and Romans), but they also knew their Bibles by heart.  Mostly Masons back then as now are ordinary men of good reputation who go to work and love their families and also find congenial relaxation and spiritual inspiration from the lessons of the Lodge.  Some Masons like Pike and Waite and Hall have been ""occultists"" of a sort during a period when many people were interested in such things as a serious ""spiritual science.'  None of them were Satanists or Sun-worshippers so far as I've ever read.  The worst thing you can say about Albert Pike is that he was verbose and a plagiarist, but he never claimed his big book was all his own words.

One good question raised was this: how can you come as a candidate for Masonry and become blind and penniless like an infant, if your heart is already filled with the Light of the World?  I think the filmmakers have a point in that.  If you are an evangelical Christian and believe you already possess all the knowledge and wisdom in the world, then you are not suitable for Masonry, for above all, a Mason must become humble to enter into the Lodge, and acknowledge his own blindness to spiritual things.  If you are the kind of Christian who sees yourself as an imperfect follower of Christ's model of virtue and humility, then nothing in Masonry will likely upset your beliefs.

Another point made repeatedly was that a Christian cannot yoke himself ""unevenly"" to unbelievers.  If you believe that the practitioners of other religions are not your equal, then again you aren't suited to be a Mason.  It takes an open mind and heart and true brotherly love for all human beings to be a good Mason.  That is not easy to cultivate.  You have to work at it in life.  I don't personally believe that any amount of Divine Grace or Salvation will make you a good person.  You cannot have it given to you on a golden platter.  God admonishes us to make ourselves better and thus to make the world just that little bit better.  Masonry has no doctrine of Salvation, or resurrection for that matter, but its allegories do hint at the possibility of rebirth, for the good man.

This film was predicated on the question of why people are leaving churches in droves.  Well, it isn't the work of Freemasons.  Masonic lodges, like all places of spiritual pursuit, are dwindling too in membership, but in the case of Masonry I think we are getting a high quality of candidates today who really want to practice some spiritual discipline in their lives.  Just having faith that someone is going to Save you if you just believe hard enough, is not a doctrine calculated to appeal to very intelligent listeners.  It apparently appeals to Satanists, though, which may be a saving grace.",1398038400,23,13144,4.780585106382978

5410368,2,B00AEDZB8Y,"I have been very highly involved in FreeMasonry for many years now, presently holding the highest rank in the blue lodge, which is Master Mason. Now I have seen and heard everything that there is to see! Whoever this Bill guy is, he is totally out of his mind, and makes a complete ass of himself by making this movie! I love how when you ask for proof of any of the things that he alleges, or that anyone does for that matter, they always say that the lower ranks don't know about the conspiracies and crimes that the upper command does! It makes us all sound like total idiots! I guess that all of the charities that we help, and the largest funded free hospital for children in the world, the Shriners Hospital, is the devils work! This organization tried to make it;s members look within themselves to make each and everyone of us a better person, and that is truly what it does! Do we have secrets, and ancient traditions that some don't understand, or feel comfortable with? Yes we do, but that is our freedom of choice. I can assure you, that I hold three degrees, one in forensic psychology, and there is nothing evil about this organization. The only oath that I took was to my God, who happens to be Christ, and not some satanic statue or being! Masons are made up of some of the best, high charactered, good willed, and God fearing people that you could ever meet. Veterans, business owners, doctors, lawyers, factory workers, and people from every profession and walk of life, and i have yet to be involved in any conversation about a new world order, or taking over the country! Get a life, and stop being so pissed off that you didn't want to go through the initiation, or couldn't make it through!

5410371,3,B00AEDZB8Y,"The rabbi (? he wears a skull cap but never says if he is a rabbi, though his beard is longer than Moses') rambles all over the place about Masonry.  He points out what an evil ""fraternity"" it really is.  The arguments he makes are clearly right.  You can't be
a good God-fearing person and be into all the occult craziness that is the heart of freemasonry.  I am speaking as a
person who has dealt with Masonry first-hand though I'm fearful to say that because people who ""squeal"" on the Masons
here in the USA, still do, too often, end up killed.  That's part of the first degree.  If U rat out the frat as being nutzo, they
will kill you.  Its not some false threat.  They follow through.  Its scary as hell.

Whatever U do, don't join the Masons.  And, for the sake of knowing what this cult is all about, buy the DVD and listen
to the rabbi.  Remember, the rabbi is a bit disorganized. He jumps from one thing to another.

In the process, the producers of this DVD tell us that the Eastern Orthodox church (the Russian-Greek, etc. churches) are
also satanic.  If U believe that, like the guys who put out this DVD do, U R crazy.

Needless to say, the producers of the DVD also say that the apostolic Roman Catholic Church (and presumably the 18 other
rites of the western Catholic Church: Byzantine, Carthusian, Greek Catholic, Maronite, Coptic, etc. etc.)  are part of
satanism, too.  The only group that doesn't get dissed are fundamentalist protestant types, from what I can tell from
the DVD.

Still, I recommend buying this thing.  Just take the trashing of other religions with a grain of salt.  I don't know why the producers
decided that had to trash bonafide christians  when the title is about the Masons.

I still have very close friends who are Masons.  Thus, I might not survive posting this but
I'm old enough (past 60) where I don't really care.

The producers have enough dirt on the Masons to expose them as what I've always
known them to be.  In essence, an occult type group that preaches Unitarianism & tolerates ""Christians"" as long as they don't say any thing about Jesus.",1439769600,7,2099,4.48941798941799

His facts about masonry are especially inaccurate! Everything he says is not substantiated by a shred of fact, and furthermore not even substantiated by logic. To say every freemason is an evil, devil worshipping demon shows how far gone this guy is. It's hard to take someone like this seriously when he twists all facts and makes these kinds of claims. There were a few good historical points about the origins of masonry, but instead of objectifying gods like Shiva or Osiris, they claim both are satan because Osiris is ""king of the underworld"" and Shiva, ""god of destruction"". So quickly they forget that 'satan' only exists in Christian teachings and taking a 'god' with a seemingly negative attribute in a vastly different religion as support for their argument is just a huge huge stretch.

I would not suggest this as a good source of exposing the errors of the cult of freemasonry. It's weirdness towards the end makes the people look like unwise conspiracy theory types. The people doing this study would have been better off sticking with citing the groups recognized authorities within masonry and then refuting the practices with the Holy scriptures of the Bible. Then you would have a wise case for standing against what the Lord God clearly forbids in secret societies and merging the false gods masons do in their rituals into the different degrees. But when i got to the last 40 minutes of the presentation all of a sudden they started inserting images of satan and making accusations of child molestation and false meanings of the Lamb skin or loin clothe that masons wear as covering the symbol of the assumed false phallus god masons supposedly worship along with other symbols; the presentation was taking a very strange turn indeed, I stopped the Dvd and was going to return it for a refund but decided it was so far off and slanderous that I out of all fairness should destroy it. It is one thing to expose something that is wrong before God; it is a whole other thing to give false information at best even though as i said they did in the beginning give source materials from the Masons recognized authorities which was revealing enough to show it is cultic in origin and a person should Not be a part of it especially if one is a Christian.
