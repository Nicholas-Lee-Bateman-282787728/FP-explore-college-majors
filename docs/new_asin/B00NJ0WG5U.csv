6657944,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"I very much enjoyed the journey.  A beautiful movie with a powerful message.  How awesome to be able to follow the little rainbow VW complete the goal of 50 states.  After years of traveling the lower 48, Fagbug, takes off on a journey across the big ocean to Hawaii.  The real stories of real people along the way and the struggles they face.  Erin returns to the mainland only to start on the long journey to the last state, Alaska.  The film documents the journey, the struggles, and the beauty of completing the goal of 50 states.  The stories of the people Erin meets along the path are touching.  Erin documents the struggle that still exists of our LGBT youth.  The stories make you laugh, they make you cry, they make you cheer.  A perfect addition to the original Fagbug documentary. An inspiration!  A perfect documentary for an GSA movie night.  Kids from 8 to 80 will fall in love with the rainbow VW.",1416960000,,913,4.5
6657945,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"The perfect follow-up to the original ""Fagbug,"" the tale of Davies' 50-state roadtrip is an excellent study in activism, guerilla education and sheer perseverance. I'm sure the original vandals never imagined their poorly executed act of hatred would spawn a nationwide campaign of tolerance and understanding.

The thing that struck me as most powerful and original about this documentary were the reactions Davies recorded in every far-flung corner of the country. As anyone who's fought in our culture wars could tell you, Supreme Court cases and sitcoms and trending hashtags are all important/helpful/appreciated, but true acceptance is earned on the ground through individual hearts and minds.

Seeing clearly unscripted reactions to Davies' car from seemingly every age/race/socioeconomic background was truly heartening. That is more of a testament to our progress than anything the media could report. It's a provocative issue, using a provocative word, presented in a provocative way. Watching people processing it in a documentary style was powerful.

Davies' own journey echoes what's going on nationally, it would seem. The struggle for equality is sweeping, however slowly, across all fifty states. Her marriage, both in its beauty and struggle (finding a state, being discriminated against by the hotelier, having her own 5-year-old nephews assess the notion as ""weird""), shows how far we've come and how far we have left to go.

And nothing was more moving than the stories of some of the children in the film. It was moving to see the young man with the fake eyelash collection, who had been bullied for being effeminate, be so lovingly embraced and supported by his mother. The testimony of the LDS mother's unconditional love for her 13-year-old gay son brought a tear to my eye. But the story of the young man who was bullied to the point of saying he thought suicide was his only option really drove home the reality of the progress yet to be made.

All in all, I appreciated the film for its very real look at what it's like on the ground right now. Davies' activism is inspirational, and having owned a Beetle myself, the number of miles she's put on that car are truly remarkable.",1416873600,,2204,5.0606060606060606
6657946,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"Erin Davies knows the power of words.  She knows firsthand the dramatic impact the word ""Fagbug"" has on people across the country.  Fagbug Nation shares diverse reactions to seeing her car and gets people talking.  Erin show us that the more we talk openly, the more people will understand the power words hold and the power we each have to make a difference.  By adressing sensitive issues and teaching others about respect, acceptance and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community we all can join Erin Davies on her journey of activism on wheels with Fagbug Nation.",1416873600,,560,4.863157894736842

6657949,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"Along comes, ""Fagbug Nation"", the much anticipated sequel and much needed update on the work of Erin Davies.  The goal now, some years later since the release of ""Fagbug"", is to take the now rainbow covered Volkswagen to the Aloha state of Hawaii and the Final Frontier state of Alaska!  The trek was long and not without many challenges but as you will see in this wonderfully directed documentary, not without its rewards and uplifting messages.  ""Fagbug Nation"" answers to the question, has there been positive change in attitudes towards the GLBT community within the last few years?  How much work remains to invite more acceptance and tolerance for same sex couples and the GLBT community?  How close are we to seeing nationwide acceptance?  If hate remains, where is it coming from?  Is there hope for the future? More than these questions are adressed and it is refreshing to see that answers seem to come from all walks of life and from all corners of the country now-- answers that come not as a result of cohersion or invasion, but rather spontaneously and sometimes humorously when Fagbug cruises along on its merry way through each state.

Erin Davies allows and invites the people to speak their minds and more often, speak from their hearts.  You will see people young and old now in Hawaii and Alaska speak up and add to the nationwide dialouge about why we as people might still hate and show intolerance towards the GLBT community and same sex marriage.  You will also hear from the GLBT a variety of responses to hate speech. Yet you will also hear from the GLBT community how much awareness has spread and how change has been made, even in the most unlikely places.

Another facinating and equally entertaining aspect of ""Fagbug Nation"" is that we can see just how hard Erin Davies works to spread awareness and just how much of her life has changed since her first documentary film, ""Fagbug"" was released some years ago.  You see a very personal story continue to develop and if you have seen ""Fagbug"", this sequel will only bring you closer to Erin Davies and invite you to reflect upon how a act of hate crime against an ordinary college student out of Albany, New York has produced a passionate advocate for GLBT equality and education.  It is a wonderful study into how sometimes our personal callings in life come from unexpected directions and circumstances.  So with all this being said, hop on board with Erin Davies and her furry sidekick, Hoosick, and enjoy the ride as she educates and enlightens and spreads her simple but vitally important message of love, acceptance, and respect for all.  -- Rachel Conlin McLeod, transgender activist and GLBT advocate, and author.",1416873600,,2701,4.790948275862069
6657962,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"An important and inspirational documentary, especially for those who are struggling to find peace with whatever situation they find themselves in. Erin Davies does an amazing job of finding support for the LGBTQ+ community in the most unlikely places. I definitely recommend watching this film.",1417996800,,294,5.555555555555555
6657963,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"Erin Davies never ceases to amaze me. This sequel ""Fagbug Nation"" follows her in a continuing adventure across the US and into Canada where she tries to accomplish her goal in getting her once vandalized now rainbow striped VW Beetle affectionately called ""Fagbug"" into the last two states Hawaii and Alaska. The story of how her car became this way is throughly covered in her first movie titled ""Fagbug"" which I strongly encourage all to watch. The sequel film ""Fagbug Nation"" however stands on its own. The goal in the movie is to get her car to all 50 states. The last ones left are the hardest to get to, Hawaii and Alaska. This in itself is a logistical nightmare that doesn't seem to get Erin down. She faces setbacks with the car shipping companies, with car repairs and discouraging family members yet still stays on tract with her goal in mind. What's uncovered in her journey is more than anyone could imagine...

My favorite thing about this movie is Erin's uncanny ability to allow people of all walks of life to express their opinion openly. She has the gift of letting people feel comfortable enough to express these feelings and thoughts without fearing any judgement or criticism on the other side. There are definitely some controversial and politically unfriendly remarks made by some, however Erin responds in an even keel manner that allows the viewer to make their own mind up without any bias or agenda.  She talks to all walks of life. I believe the people she encounters in her travels are a Macro view of American society today. There are people who identify as straight, bi, queer, gay, transgender, Christians, Mormons, a gay/straight couple and sadly bullied children who's hearts are clearly breaking at too young of an age. All of these people have interesting and differing views on all of the hot topics of today. I found all the interviews fascinating and incredibly moving. The interview with the mormon mother in particular really touched me on a personal level. Coming from a very rigid and unaccepting christian family it was so nice to see a Mother that would openly love and embrace her gay son. It made me have hope for our future generation knowing that even a mother coming from a very strict faith could value love over religion.

The cinamatography in this film is absolutely stunning! From the intense lush colors of Maui to the intense mountain views of British Columbia into Alaska. Erin did an incredible job of filming this on her own. You would think she had a full film crew with her, but no it was just Erin and her ever adorably cute Pomeranian Hoosick in Alaska and Erin and her wife Sonya with her in Maui.

This movie is a MUST SEE!!! Watching this movie is a cathartic experience with emotional crescendos. It had me on an emotional roller coaster the entire time. I've watched it at least 3 times now, by myself and with different family and friends. Just like her car driving across the country this movie invokes thoughts and opens up a dialogue that otherwise might not exist.  5 stars. 2 Thumbs up. 10 out of 10.",1417910400,,3075,4.687037037037037
6657964,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"I have worked with Erin for several years in an educational capacity & can recommend the film highly for college viewing--and for anyone interested in social justice.  It gets students talking about social activism, queer rights, and how to be better allies, among other important topics.  Erin's message is inclusive, positive, and inspiring.  See the film & consider bringing her to your campus!",1417651200,,397,5.26984126984127
6657965,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"""Fagbug Nation"" ROCKS!  Erin Davies is the owner of the Fagbug car and producer of this film.  I have come to know and deeply respect her and the work that she is doing.  She has created this sequel to her award-winning first movie, ""Fagbug.""  It is a moving documentary that shows the good side and the not-so-good side of the American people, and how they respond to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) issues.  It would be hard to not notice her rainbow VW bug if it were to drive up beside you.  Erin videotapes the reactions of those who see it, and interviews those that are willing.  The end result is a mix of supportive and bigoted comments - words that are both beautiful and ugly.  I laughed and cried while watching this film.  Erin should be applauded for this amazing piece of art, and the mountains she had to move (and cross!) to accomplish her goal.  She has given us a wonderful gift with this film.",1417564800,,932,4.494047619047619
6657966,5,B00NJ0WG5U,FAGBUG is truly activism on wheels. An inspiring movie about about how a car and it's driver Erin Davies can change the lives of people who encounter them. It brings hope and awareness to everyone who watches it.,1417564800,,212,4.605263157894737
6657967,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"When I first heard about the Fagbug and Erin's story, I didn't fully understand how deep of an impact it was having. This film has helped open my eyes to the importance of her message. When you're in the LGBT+ community, it is often difficult to remember that you have people in your corner who are changing the world around you. She puts her experience in the spotlight with this film. Her rainbow car is sending shockwaves of acceptance through the United States with every mile travelled and every city visited. Erin is able to infuse her mission and journey with an infectious hope and determination that draws people to her. Every interview cements the power of the Fagbug in drawing people's true feelings forward. Her interview with a couple who married for interesting reasons is particularly fascinating.

I was constantly amazed by how far Erin was willing to go in the documentary to reach Hawaii and Alaska. Exhausting plane rides, constant repair shop visits, tense transportation of the Fagbug and harrowing car rides highlight the strength of Erin's character. You feel the love in her journey. My favorite parts of the movie were of Erin and Hoosick travelling down the Alaskan road, a woman with her faithful dog changing the world. I will always recommend this film to people and repeat Erin's story and message. If anybody as not seen this movie, I would suggest they give it a watch.",1417478400,,1403,4.821576763485477
6657968,5,B00NJ0WG5U,Great documentary.  Erin Davies is truly an inspiration.  A must see!,1417478400,,69,5.181818181818182
6657969,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"I was very moved by Erin's first film, FagBug.  If you haven't seen that one, you should.  It requires a great deal of bravery to take something so hurtful and hateful and to own it and wear it proudly for all the world to see.  Not everyone can do what Erin has done, not for so long, and not with as much grace and continued passion.

FagBug Nation has even surpassed Erin's first film.  The message is still going strong, as is the car and especially Erin herself.  There are many laughs and tears in this one, and the music and sound quality are nothing short of big-budget, professional grade.  Erin has assembled an incredibly talented group of people to make this film something truly special.",1417478400,,700,4.507936507936508
6657970,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"It is really amazing to me the varied reactions that Davies and the Fagbug receive and I love that she isn't afraid to show those reactions. We get to see the good, the bad and everything in between. Davies shows depth of character by always keeping her sense of humor and takes whatever is thrown her way. This is a great follow up to the original Fagbug movie!",1417478400,,362,4.338235294117647
6657971,5,B00NJ0WG5U,Great documentary! One minute you are crying and the next you are laughing. A must see ! Way to go Erin :),1417478400,,106,3.8636363636363638
6657972,5,B00NJ0WG5U,Fagbug Nation was an excellent documentary that brings life to the reality of discrimination in a very creative way.  You will fall in love with Erin's great sense of humor as you travel along with her in her journey to Hawaii and Alaska in the Fagbug.,1417478400,,252,4.478260869565218
6657973,5,B00NJ0WG5U,Fagbug Nation is truly a five-star film.  Erin allows the viewer to take an interesting and different perspective on the LGBT community.  We are able to hear and see how she is changing the nation one state at a time.  Her determination and ambition to finish her journey and visit all fifty states is sure to be an inspiration to all.,1417478400,,335,4.459016393442623
6657974,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"Erin has done it again. An amazing sequel to the original movie. Again, I laughed, I cryed, and I mostly feel empowered. As an avid VW enthusiast, and a gay male, this movie really touches me on so many levels. I have met Erin in person, and she's been a huge inspiration to me. Great job Erin, love Aaron.",1417392000,,306,4.203389830508475
6657975,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"This is a very well produced documentary that shows how responses never change, they just get better at how they portray what they think about why things are the way they are. Celebrating honest reactions helps us move into new beginnings.",1417392000,,239,4.853658536585366
6657976,5,B00NJ0WG5U,I absolutely LOVE both Fagbug and Fagbug Nation! These films are so inspiring and had such a big impact on my family and I! I can't say enough good things about Fagbug. Erin Davies is not just an activist but an artist as well and I love how she is changing people's lives along the way! You've got to see Fagbug and Fagbug Nation! They're at the top of my list! I just had to review everything Fagbug related because I really think everybody should see the Fagbug movies!,1417392000,,472,4.314606741573034
6657977,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"What I really appreciate about this documentary is that it shows people's own views on how they see bullying and equal marriage. Persons who Erin meets during her adventurous travel in the US are from  all ages, genders, sexualities, colors, cities, etc. That's the one thing that makes this documentary so beautiful: it's very inclusive. Even when talking about such difficult topics...no one is left out. Children and elderly people are in and everybody in between.
You also get to see the humorous sides of being an activist...she meets many unexpected creatures on the road...I laughed a lot ;)
As a European I found this culturally very very interesting as well.",1417392000,,667,5.009009009009009
6657978,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"Watch Erin Davies as she finally fulfills her dream to get her rainbow VW Beetle to all 50 states, sparking meaningful dialogue, social change, and strong reactions along the way.  Fagbug Nation is the documentary that chronicles the continuation and culmination of a journey that began in Davies first documentary, Fagbug.  However, the film is so much more than a self-serving, personal chronicle of an exciting, American road trip.  Davies puts herself and her car right in the eye of the cultural storm, inviting and maybe even daring the general public to comment and react.  The beating heart of this film is the collection of stories told by the people Davies interviewed in the film, all of whom by the way, approached the filmmaker of their own accord.  Davies did not solicit interviews from anyone in the film- the beauty of the activists car is that IT provokes the conversation and the reactions, many of them visceral and therefore clearly authentic.  Davies does a fair job of including a diverse bunch of interviewees, both in terms of viewpoint and demographics.  And what they have to say is at times heartening, heart-rending, funny, informative, charming, inspiring, joyful, and sad.  Thats how and why this film deeply affected me.  The face of the movement for equality is laid bare and it is made up of the experiences of the people who have lived and are living their lives in service to its progress- people like those interviewed in the film.

Rock on Erin, for so beautifully and skillfully capturing the depth of the problems of homophobia and bullying without neglecting to show the hopeful and beautiful acts of change and progress! 5 stars, easy.  Watch it and Fagbug, immediately!",1417392000,,1712,4.930313588850174
6657979,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"The scenery is beautiful, and Erin has definitely improved as a filmmaker since the original Fagbug. It's surprisingly funny at points and includes some very earnest interviews by every day people that showcase the increasingly positive relationship between America and homosexuality, though there is still a ways to go. If you're looking for a travel documentary about a gay car, this one's for you. Four stars for the movie, and an extra star for the great music video by Fortress of Attitude at the end!",1417392000,,506,4.964705882352941
6657980,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"When Erin Davies, a lesbian film maker, set out to make her sophomore film, Fagbug Nation, she began from a point evolution. Drawing from her experiences from Fagbug, her first movie, a movie that was born out of a response to gay hate vandalism left on her VW Beetle.  Fagbug Nation, now explores the life of Erin Davies and the people she encounters, as she embarks on a quest to reach all fifty states, in her now rainbow beetle!
 It is apparent throughout the movie that this is a labor of love.  The countless miles, the dangers of traveling alone, often traveling to places without cell service (can you even believe it?), showcases the dedication Davies has to being a visible light in the battle for LGBTQ equality.
A lot has happened in the life of Erin Davies, since she first decided to take her vandalized car on a journey across America.  An art educator, originally, Davies is now traveling the country as professional speaker. Her message is simple: Trust your gut. Her impact is profound.
The reoccurring theme throughout the movie is: one person can make a difference. This is evidenced through the numerous interviews of people along the way.  We hear amazing tales, each with a very unique perspective. Davies, effectively weaves a powerful message of pride.  It is hard to not feel inspired, while watching this movie.
One of the most notable changes is the addition of a fury feline, Hoosick, a Pomeranian, who accompanies her on her travels and offers support, companionship and often comic relief. Davies also found love and allows us to partake in her journey down the aisle and while allowing her personal life to take center stage. It is a beautiful tale of a modern woman, claiming her own story and bringing awareness to the lives of LGBTQ people, in the hopes of building community.",1417305600,,1811,4.7699680511182105
6657981,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"After seeing the first Fagbug documentary, I was touched by Erin's story of becoming an accidental activist of sorts (after her car was vandalized, she took it as an opportunity to speak out rather than an excuse to hide).  I was instantly inspired to start following her constantly developing story at that point.  I have followed her journey through her website and social media pages.
I am thrilled that I have finally gotten to watch the next step of her journey by watching Fagbug Nation.  I finally got to hear the stories about those photographs taken throughout her travels and hear the stories of those she encountered along the way.  I think this one is even more touching and amazing than the first!  Erin has a way of talking about LGBT issues in a very personal way by inviting the viewers into her life as well as talking to others to find out how they look these subjects as well.
Fagbug Nation has the feel of watching a friend or loved one reach a personal goal and discover a lot of things along the way.  That is part of what makes it so powerful.  That is what make me cry a few tears when hearing the stories of those who had faced bullying and hate just because they were part of the LGBT community as well as what made me smile at each victory or success that Erin had along her journey.
I highly recommend watching this documentary.  It is a story that is worth hearing and one that is told in a fantastic way.",1417219200,,1434,4.384905660377359

Along the way, Erin documents the struggles and bullying gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals encounter in their everyday lives.

She brings her travels to your home in the infamous ""fagbug"", her Volkswagen Beetle that was once vandalized in an act of hate.  Since then, Erin and her car have long since become a testament for standing up to hate and bigotry.  An amazing movement for love has grown out of this single act of violence.

""Fagbug Nation"" is a wonderful film filled with interviews from a great diversity of individuals all across the 50 United States.  It is definitely worth the ride and generates emotions from each end of the spectrum.  Definitely recommended! :)",1417219200,,869,4.910958904109589

What I appreciate about Fagbug Nation is how Davies shows how homophobia impacts us all.  The scenes with the children are the most powerful. The support the youths in Fagbug Nation feel from these few families magnifies how not all youth (or even adults), regardless of the reasons for which which they are bullied/judged, receive that sort of security, whether it be physical, mental, or even spiritual, thus illustrating how dangerous hate and bullying are when left unchecked.  I do agree with earlier recommenders that as a stand alone film, this one is not as strong as the original Fagbug, but it is worthy of our time, just the same.",1417132800,,803,4.839416058394161

While typical media isolates, Fagbug Nation reminds us that we are all connected and that talking to the people around us is both possible and potentially transformative.  I love Fagbug Nation and commend Erin on her willingness to fully offer herself to this conversation by embodying it fully, and continuing to make herself available, regardless of the inconvenience.  Being a symbol of hope or a target of criticism for so many is no easy task. Erin, thank you for your creativity, vision and the love and inspiration you offer us all!

I am a single mom and a lesbian and this film, like the original, portrays the fight against homophobia and bullying gays in a refreshing and comedic light. My children sat through the entire film and enjoyed both the message of the film, all the individual stories, and the scenery. Erin's trips around this country to bring awwareness to a terrible and continued injustice is an inspiration to all the other slacktivists out there. Watch this film. Be inspired.

The stories are touching and insightful and Erin continues to prove that you can take an act of discrimination and turn it into something positive!

8678493,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"I found out about Erin Davies and her vandalized VW Bug last year when I watched Fagbug on Netflix. This week I watched her sequel, Fagbug Nation. After the first film, I wondered if that was the end of her activism on the subject of LGBT rights and equality. I thought, maybe she will go back to ""normal"" life now. I was pleasantly surprised to learn of her devotion to the cause and that she continued on with her mission of raising LGBT awareness. I watched this sequel, clinging to Erin's every word and the words of those she interviewed, imagining myself driving all those miles, to all of the speaking events, staying in motels, getting little sleep, paying thousands for car repairs, yet still pushing onward. Honestly, I lack the mental or physical capacity to embark on such a mission. But Erin persisted through all the obstacles. She is truly an activist of my generation. In both Fagbug and Fagbug Nation, her warmth, authenticity and empathy come across beautifully on-screen. With her personality and dedication to the cause, she is sincerely a force to be reckoned with. Her power lies in her words, in her commitment and in her passion for spreading the message of tolerance and acceptance. I recommend both of Erin's films to everyone and particularly encourage people who identify as members of the LGBTQIA community to share them with their friends and relatives. It is up to Erin's supporters, to all supporters of equal rights, to continue to promote attention to the issues in hopes of furthering positive social change.",1422662400,,1543,4.848484848484849
8678494,5,B00NJ0WG5U,"While not LGBT myself, I find the topic of gay rights very important. Important obviously for LGBT people, but just as important to everyone. All people being equal, all people should be treated equal and as a friend to some LGBT people, it pleases me greatly that the countries attitude is changing, albeit slowly. This documentary is about a woman traveling to and fro, trying to get to all 50 states with her awesome rainbow Volkswagen Beetle and having those experiences recorded, I thank Erin Davies for that. I'm glad I got to see this! This movie really shows the ridiculous things LGBT people have put up with and be subjected to, little things that you wouldn't even think about. It also shows you just how fragile people's acceptance is and just how shallow their prejudices lie - and sometimes come out even without their knowledge.",1422403200,,843,4.780821917808219
