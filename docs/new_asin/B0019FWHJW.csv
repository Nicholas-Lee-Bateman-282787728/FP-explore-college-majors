8273947,5,B0019FWHJW,"If you are going to watch one of these, you might as well watch the entire (currently) three-volume set.  I have a comprehensive review for the set, on the set's Amazon page for those interest.  The one thing I will note, here, is that these discs are valuable to those who have quite a bit of knowledge already about Objectivism and Rand.  The series IS NOT an introduction.  (See my review of the set.)",1407801600,,404,4.418918918918919
8273948,1,B0019FWHJW,Branden is once again taking advantage of Rand's genius. Not a single showing of Ms Rand during the whole DVD.,1359331200,,110,4.55
8273949,3,B0019FWHJW,"I have watched Vol. 1 and 2, but I don't feel that they are anything like an oral history of objectivism. Both DVDs include interesting reminiscences of Rand by people who knew her back in the day. That's mostly what you get. Vol. I-2 are titled: ""Remembering the Early Years"" and ""A Movement is Launched."" These titles imply the narrative of a cultural history. You don't get anything like that implied history in these DVDs. I am not unhappy that I own these; I am just disappointed that the Objectivist History Project did not really offer a history or much in the way of the materials of a history.",1342051200,,602,4.532110091743119
