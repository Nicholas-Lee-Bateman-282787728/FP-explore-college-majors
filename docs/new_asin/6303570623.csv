7852693,4,6303570623,"Martial arts star Jeff Wincott doesn't come out kicking in THE DONOR, but he delivers a solid, convincing performance nonetheless.

Wincott plays Billy Castle, a stuntman who picks up a beautiful girl in a local bar, takes her to a motel and wakes up the next morning with one of his kidneys missing!  He has a lovely doctor, played with stylish gusto by Michelle Johnson, and a bunch of inept cops who don't really think his story is worth digging into.  Wincott however doesn't curry much favor to what has been done to him, and takes off on a man or woman hunt to find the dastardly fiends who did this to him.

There's a nice touch with a Victims Survival Group, headed by the understated Amanda Tapping, which provides some comfort and support for Wincott's character, who at first resists the need.  There are lots of red herrings, including a kindly doctor played by DYNASTY'S Gordon Thomson and even Wincott's closest friends.

An interesting clue is a contact which is found in Wincott's surgical wound...amazing how many people wear them.

A nice change of pace for Wincott and an entertaining and frightening concept done well.",1097366400,,1138,4.775510204081633

his liver were taken out.)  Second, the woman who drugs him is NOT
the one who removes his kidney.  I guess other reviewers were not
paying attention.",1089763200,,223,4.525
7852695,4,6303570623,"Jeff Wincott returns to Canada for this Suspence not martial arts movie. He plays a stuntman who is drugged while with a woman, who removes his liver for the Black market. It was filmed in and around the city I live,  which is rare because films mostly prefer to use the Downtown Toronto  areas. Worth a look.",958694400,,309,4.4035087719298245
