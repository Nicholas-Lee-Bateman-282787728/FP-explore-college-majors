8011468,5,B0001ENX4A,"A arrest and trial of a man supposedly innocent, but history says otherwise because he treated the accused assassin Booth's broken leg after shooting President Lincoln. Dennis Weaver did Mudd justice and a good portrayal of a doctor forever caught up in the mysteries and unsolved intrigue of he Lincoln assassination and it's aftermath.",1417132800,,337,5.2592592592592595
8011469,5,B0001ENX4A,"In the 1970's and 1980, the hotel I worked for had 12 movie crews, staying there. Some great movie stars, and a few great actors. ""The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd"", was a very good movie, and I especially love the scenes I saw shot. Guy Del Russo, was the makeup artist on the film, and a good friend of mine, who died shortly after filming. That makes this movie very special. If you want to know how much this movie means to me. I paid a private individual $99.00, for my copy of the DVD. I say, it was a bargain. This movie, in my opinion, was one of the best performances, by Dennis Weaver, a great actor, who is missed. Also the acting in the best tradition, were Richard Dysart, and Susan Sullivan. I say, get this movie, and see the injustice, this government, imposed on one very great man, played by a great man. This one's for you Guy. J. Russell, ""Marty"", Savannah, Georgia",1380153600,3,875,4.27710843373494

Dennis took my son around the shoot, then wrote a note--an excuse from school for him. My son's teacher excused his absence.....and kept the note.

8011472,4,B0001ENX4A,We had taken a trip to the island where Dr. Mudd was held it made the movie even better. This is a lost piece of lost history. The movie is a little slow but tell of the aftermath of the President Lincoln assassination. Dr. Mudds true story of being in the wrong place doing good things and having half a life time of trouble because of it.,1265328000,3,340,4.08955223880597
8011473,4,B0001ENX4A,"A wonderful performance by All the Players taking part in this chunk of history, as astonishing as; ""The Prisoner of Shark Island."" To quote from James Swanson's informative and meticulously researched book 'Manhunt' - Asia Booth's (John Wilkes Booth's sister) loving memory to her brother closes with a graveside elegy: ""But, granting that he died in vain, yet gave his all on earth, youth, beauty, manhood, a great human love, the certainty of excellence in his profession,a powerful brain, the strength of an athlete, health and great wealth, for 'his cause.' This man was noble in life, he periled his immortal soul, and he was brave in death. Already his hidden remains are given Christian burial, and strangers have piled his grave with flowers."" ""'So runs the world away.'""",1194739200,3,780,5.054263565891473
8011474,5,B0001ENX4A,"Very well acted and factual, I waited many years to finally SEE this one again, much less get it on DVD and it was well worth the wait! Dennis Weaver as Dr. Mudd and Susan Sullivan as his wife are virtually flawless in their respective roles. I've only had it for 2 months and have watched it twice; once myself and again when friends came over a week later and wanted to see it and THEY loved it so much that they ordered a copy.  It's well worth getting!!

I also reccommend PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND,it's an older MUDD type video,now available on another website, but a great flick.",1091664000,10,584,4.348623853211009
