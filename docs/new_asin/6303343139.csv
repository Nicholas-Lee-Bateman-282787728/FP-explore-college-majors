7844385,5,6303343139,"To understand most of Tintin movies you have to read the books, i grew up reading all of Herge Adventures of Tintin, the movis does not end in the middle it ends just as the book wants it to end, in the Secret of the Unicorn the movie is about finding the maps which will lead to the treasure, but to continue the story you have to read RED RACKHAMS TREASURE that is where the story continues, i would advise to buy the books first read them and then watch the movies, just like Destination Moon continues with Explorers on the moon, The Seven Crytal balls continue with the Prisoners of the Sun, so some of these books/movies are in a series, so don't be impatient but read the books and you'll get the whole stories, my favourites are the Calculus Affair, the Castafiore Emerald.etc",1051401600,4,784,4.413793103448276
7844386,5,6303343139,"People who have *read* the Tintin book ""Secret of The Unicorn"" know that it ends with them finding the maps. The whole point of the book is to find the maps. What happens with the maps is told in the book ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". Before grousing that Amazon is falsely advertising movies and that the movie is incomplete, please take the time to read the books this movie based on. The books are just as good or better than the movie. Thank you",998784000,,445,4.373493975903615
7844387,4,6303343139,"Excellent rendition of the book! I grew up with these stories and was excited to show my son (too young to read). To those who think the video is only half of the story, you're obviously not a true Tintin reader! The Secret of the Unicorn is depicted in it's entierty. What Tintin and the rest do with the three maps can only be seen in Red Rackham's Treasure! It was fantastic to see these childhood favorites come to life. Bravo!",988934400,5,431,4.333333333333333
7844388,3,6303343139,"The movie stops in the middle of the story. TinTin gets all the 3 maps and the movies is over....! My son is extremely  very angry on this incomplete movie. If the movie is based on a story book called ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" then it must complete the whole story other wise they should NOT release this video. The Amazon.com customer service also refused me to take return this VHS and refund my money. It is not only disappointing, it is frustrating. They says it is only 30 minutes coverage of the story. My question to them, If  you do NOT have a complete movie ready according to the story book, then why are you selling this VHS ?",981763200,9,640,4.2809917355371905
7844389,5,6303343139,"Very true to the book, which is refreshing.  I wish all the books were available on video in English.  Good clean adventures, with good (subtle) lessons about doing the right thing.  Tintin is an excellent, humble, hero--snowy too!  So rare today in kids entertainment.",978912000,,269,5.045454545454546
7844390,5,6303343139,Since I was a kid I read all the stories in Spanish. I still have all the collection. Some years ago HBO presented all the stories in video and we tape them all. My kids love them. It is known that Herge would take up to a  year to complete one of Tintin's adventures and the detail and quality is  marvelous. The video presentation is a faithful representation of the  original stories. Great for ALL ages.,952646400,13,407,4.328947368421052
7844391,5,6303343139,"This movie is an excellent addition to any tintin fan's collection. See Marlinspike hall as it was occupied by the Bird Brothers. Even the Captian's Butler, Nestor, is with them! A definite buy!",937612800,7,194,4.909090909090909
