371229,1,6301851293,"I thought nothing could be worse than part 2 or 3 but we have a new candiate here for Initiation(which should have been the title of the movie)is the worst in the series by far. First off it has nothing to with the series and doesn't have anything to do with christmas(don't be fooled by the x-mas tree on the cover,you won't see santa in this movie)and the isn't even remotely entertaining to say the least. Its about a cult the manipulates a TV reporter into joining their cult. The movie has stupid effects with bugs as other reviewers have said and the effects are downright awful. This is the halloween 3 of the series,it is a bad excuse for a side story that should have never have been a movie in the first place just like (Season Of The Witch)or (New Beginning) of Friday The 13th for that matter. In other words the movie doesn't belong. SKIP THIS AND SEE THE CLASSIC HORROR MOVIE(1984/SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT)INSTEAD AND YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!",1056931200,2,958,4.511494252873563
371230,2,6301851293,"No relation to earlier films in the series (I haven't seen #3 yet) which is a good thing.
The movie stars Maud Adams (007's MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and OCTOPUSSY) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother).
A female news reporter Kim (Neith Hunter) is investigating the mysterious case of a woman's death by spontaneous combustion, which are linked to a bizzare satanic cult led by occult bookstore owner Adams and her freaky son Howard, who are on a quest for immortality.
The movie is still nothing special, although there is a standout scene where Hunter is lying on her back in the grass looking up at some trees and the trees form the image of a face smiling down at her,  and another good scene where a topless Hunter vomits bugs then her face melts. Nice huh? Merry Xmas everyone.",1039651200,4,777,4.55
371231,2,6301851293,"There is no connection between this film and the first three in the series, but that is not an automatic positive.
This straightforward, gruesome story has a cute plucky reporter with boyfriend troubles investigating the mysterious death of a woman, and getting caught up in a witches' coven led by Maud Adams, eons from ""Octopussy.""
The lead actress is easy on these tired eyes, Clint Howard plays the same nutjob role he always gets outside of his brother's films, and the movie keeps a tight pace. But take away the ""Part 4"" from the title, and this is just another straight to video gorefest that was not good enough to get wide release in the theaters first. Sure, the gore involving giant bugs is good, but there is nothing really special here. That said, this is still severed head and shoulders above the first three entries in the series.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore, profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, sexual content, and adult situations.",1022630400,6,1008,4.866279069767442
371232,1,6301851293,"I love the SN,DN series, and I shudder to think that I almost gave the series up after seeing this crap(my first viewing of any chapter in this series).  It involves a woman being forced to join an evil cult of man-hating she-demons.  Their henchman is named Ricky, but it is definately  not the Ricky from the last 3 films.  He is well acted by Clint Howard, but  a very boring character.  All of the acting here is horrid (except Clint's  of course...) and the story is confusing, boring, sexist, and just plain  bad.  True, the first one in the series was bad, but in a good, fun sort of  way.  This movie just sucks.  The special effects are good, but that and  Clint are the only things that are.  This movie has very little to do with  Christmas and NOTHING to do with the first three films.  SN,DN parts  2,3,and 5 are all five-star movies.  The original is only a three-star  movie and this is a no-star movie.  I only gave it one star because I had  to.  Please, AVOID SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 4: INITIATION, LIKE THE  PLAGUE!  IT IS VERY VERY BAD!",957225600,2,1058,4.3076923076923075
371233,4,6301851293,"This was one hell of a weird movie!  It was well made, a bit slow, but the end result isn't as bad as one might expect. I juts didn't get what the bugs were for, but its ok, the movie kept me in suspense throughout, even  the scenes that were less suspenseful were nevertheless very engrossing,  because the movie itself was so strange and weird. It's well worth it  though, just to take a look if you've seen any of the other Silent Night  films. Not for all tastes though, keep that in mind.",946425600,2,493,4.202127659574468
7816155,2,6301851293,"Silent night Deadly night 4 is a mess of a movie.  The movie has nothing to do with the original about a killer dressed in a Santa suit.  There is no Santa at all in this movie.  It does take place during the Christmas season.  The movie begins with a woman falling off a buildings roof engulfed in flames.  A female reporter is investigating the case of what is thought to be spontaneous combustion.  Then we learn that the flaming woman is linked to a group of man hating woman who are either witches or Satanists I couldn't figure out which. The group is lead by a blonde woman who owns a bookstore in L.A.  She meets the reporter when she buys some books about spontaneous combustion.  She gives the reporter a dried date and then takes the pit when she spits it out.  They do have one man who helps them a man named Ricky who is played by Clint Howard, Ron's brother.  The woman want to Initiate the reporter and have her be one of them.  The initiation involves some large slimy parasites that chew abdomens.  And that bowl of dates shows up again  But this time the date turns into a beetle before she eats it.  At one point the groups leader says to the reporter it's hard to give birth to yourself.  What does it all mean? who knows.  I think the only reason they gave this movie the Silent Night, Deadly Night title was to try to get people to watch this mess.  This movie made me want to eat some dates years ago I ate them all the time.",1418428800,,1448,4.207272727272727

In the end the woman brakes the curse by killing the person behind the curse. This movie is boring, foolish, and pointless. Dont waste your money and time on this movie. They have made some great silent night movies which include part 2, part 3, part 5, and the 2012 remake watch those ones they are worth watching, unlike this goffy movie.",1367539200,,457,4.325581395348837
7816157,2,6301851293,"An investigative reporter is attempting to solve a recent suicide that seems to be linked to a mysterious feminist cult in SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 4. This film couldn't have anything less to do with the rest of the series, and clearly had the name tacked on at the last minute for publicity. No Santa Claus. No Christmas killing spree. No Fun. Instead, it plays closer to THE WICKER MAN or THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM. Only badly. The confused plot even has the lead fantasize about giant bugs before transforming into one herself? And for no better reason than to show off more of Screaming Mad George's gruesome creature effects. Clint Howard takes over for Eric Freeman and Bill Moseley in a throwaway role as ""Ricky Caldwell,"" if you can even call him that. Another terrible sequel.

7816159,1,6301851293,"When it comes to the Christmas season we feel it necessary to sprinkle in some b relating to our favorite holiday. Since it's our roots we always like to bring at least one horror into play. Last year we went with the extremely laughable Christmas Evil and decided this year to go with one of the Silent Night Deadly Night flicks. The reason for choosing the 4th installment was simple...CLINT HOWARD. With that name tagged to a movie there really is no other choice besides moving forward. Unfortunately this mess couldn't capitalize off of a very insane homeless Howard leaving it a 1 star rating at best.

Within the first minute of the film we were sure that it would be a classic when Clint Howard finds a half eaten burger on the side of the road and digs in. As he scarfs his newly found treat he watches a women screaming atop a building. For some reason she catches fire as she spills to the streets and we just laughed and laughed. From there we're introduced to the main character reporter lady as she gets plowed by her greased up boyfriend to be interrupted by the story of the dead woman. She decides she wants to report the case and gets approval from her boss, who just happened to be Reggie from the Phantasm series. Yes the same Reggie we've always claimed to look like Clint, and here they are in the same movie which should have been so sweet. But it wasn't which is why our synopsis has to end here.

With a street wandering Clint Howard, his stunt double Reggie, and a kid named Lonny we can't understand how this one wasn't a great success. It's a real mystery why they decided to switch up the premise of these films at number 4, but it was a grave mistake. The potential was limitless and should have been so bad it's good with ease. We really tried so hard to be interested by it but couldn't get past the boring premise and horrific acting. Now we are going to have to find some other Christmas horror b to wash away the memory of this waste. So this one will get the patent when you return it to the video store of ""he's gone, the evils gone from here!""",1259452800,3,2081,4.333333333333333

7816161,3,6301851293,"The Film: Silent Night Deadly Night 4 Initiation
Year Released: 1990

Overview: A beautiful reporter, Kim (Neith Hunter) is the witness of a woman who falls to her death and spontaneously combusts into flames.  She begins to investigate the death of the woman, but finds herself caught up in a group of witches who want her to be their new member.  Only trouble is, Kim refuses to be one of them!

The Package: 3 Stars. This review is for the VHS tape of this film, from live home video.  The tape is recorded in SP mode which is what you want when it comes to VHS.  The box is interesting.  The white box cover, combined with a woman holding a large knife and a Christmas tree in the background makes this look interesting and something I would want to buy.

Spook Meter: 2 Stars. Their is nothing really scary here at all.  A few scenes with Ricky will give you a light ""chill"" but nothing much.  This has nothing to do with the first brilliant film Silent Night Deadly Night.  The only thing this film has to do with it at all is a guy named Ricky is in this but the story has nothing to do with the original film. Don't expect any kind of Santa killing people, because it's just not here.  I don't have a problem with that, if this was a great film in itself, but it's not very good. I almost don't even consider this a horror film; it's more along the lines of mystery/suspense. The concept of this is interesting but this just kind of plods along with only a few parts throughout that sort of grab the viewer's attention but not for long.  Kim (Neith Hunter) does a very good job acting, as with Ricky (Clint Howard) which does help things some.

Gore/Violence Meter: 3 Stars. There is some blood/gore here but not a whole lot.  A few scenes are a bit gory so I bumped up the meter one notch.  There are some parts that may gross out some viewers but it's not over the top by any means.

Profanity Meter: 4 Strikes. There is a lot of language in this film, which I find dissapointing.

Sexual Meter: 4 Strikes.  There are scenes where a woman's breasts are shown.  There is some fairly strong sexual make out scenes that maybe considered pretty strong and some viewers will not wish to see.

Final Thoughts: This is ok in some aspects.  If you watch this with the idea that it's nothing to do with the first Silent Night Deadly Night and if you don't expect a deep horror thrill ride, then you might kind of find this interesting to watch since it does have some interesting twists and turns that might spark your interest some.  Not a total disappointment by any means,  but could have been much better.",1198540800,2,2610,4.345041322314049
