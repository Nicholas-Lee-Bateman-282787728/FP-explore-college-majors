Thanks for the memories TESLA and thanks for continuing to DO WHAT YOU DO!!,1124064000,3,523,4.350515463917525
1711272,4,B000066726,"I constantly have to justify Tesla's greatness to my Radiohead-listening, artsy-fartsy elitist friends. It becomes harder to do while watching this DVD. I'm not much of a showman myself, but these guys put on quite a show in their early days. A lot of guitar hero moves, headbands, sparkly belts and other cheeseball outfits. I never believed my friend when she said she hung out with Tesla back in the day and they were glammy. They certainly weren't glammy as in makeup and skintight leather pants, but they had those fancy moves onstage, fireballs in the videos and just other wacky 80's things that made me absolutely cringe. The interviews are cool, and they show the down to earth side that exists underneath the showman. I also hate editing-why do they throw in footage where the members are obviously playing a completely different song or part of the music? Come on, spend some money to synch it up. Other than that, it's a cool video. It's also interesting to find out how much Jeff was hurt by the death of his dog. Tesla has farms philosophy-simple folk stuff, and it's refreshing. Focus on the great music and you'll be okay.",1037145600,7,1138,4.695
1711273,5,B000066726,"Tesla rocks and they rock HARD on this DVD!! It's great to have every single Tesla video clip on crystal clear DVD. These videos bring back many memories. I totally recommend this DVD to all fans of pure hard rock!! Tesla is one the best bands EVER! I cannot say enough good things about them! Hope to see them in concert some day. I hear that Tesla are explosive live, and every time I listen to the OUTSTANDING 2CD Replugged Live set I am blown away! Times Makin Changes gives you a look at the bands stage performance, although all audio tracks except for Lazy Days, Crazy Nights & the Five Man Jam clips are from studio albums. Do yourself a favor and pick this DVD up! You won't regret it!",1023408000,4,694,4.305343511450381

7961634,5,B000066726,"Ummm, Amazon, don't mean to be petty cuz I LOVE you guys! But Tesla is NOT a Southern California band as you stated. They are Sacramento boys as they are very proud to say! Also, I lived in Sacramento when they started out and were playing all the small clubs around there. So this is just to set the record (pun intended) straight! Haha",1442275200,,337,4.28125

7961638,5,B000066726,I think without a doubt that Tesla is be one of those bands that don't give up lightly and they have shown us through time that a great band holds their own and comes back for more and gives far more than any band of their time. Sure a CD is fine in the car but with this band video's are what sets them apart from all the others and I'm not saying that the others aren't great because they are but Tesla far exceeds my expectations of what a rock band can and will do. Keep it up Tesla you rock!,1348963200,,496,3.872549019607843

7961640,5,B000066726,"Tesla's Time's Makin' Changes The Videos and More is an essential must have for fans of rock/hard rock. Originally released on vhs back in 1995 it was released for a short time on DVD and is now currently out of print.
Alot of people tend to lump Tesla into the hair metal category, but that's a gross injustice to them, they were and continue to make great rock n roll music. Included on this DVD are interviews, concert footage (including soundback performances on a couple tracks, and of course the video clips for classics such as ""Modern Day Cowboy"", ""Little Suzy"", ""Lovesong"", ""The Way it is"" and others. Included are 2 performances from their legendary 5 man acoustical band release, ""Signs"" and ""Paradise"". The DVD for the most part follows the track list found on the greatest hits cd of the same name, Time's Makin' Changes, the best of Tesla. I was thrilled to see that the band included footage of them performing one of my favorite songs from them, ""Lazy Days, Crazy Nights"".",1215648000,2,988,4.683908045977011
