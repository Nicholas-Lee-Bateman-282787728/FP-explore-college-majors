3901456,4,B002BXGIPA,"I am still hooked on finding out who the real Shelburn is.  I figured this show would keep me hooked on to that storyline and it did.  I don't think I was too excited for the wedding of Chin-Ho and Malia, as I don't really like her.  But the storyline was simple and easy to follow.  I mean, that's what I like about Hawaii Five-), takes me back to Hawaii-nei, quick mystery in one show, sprinkled in with the longer storyline of Wo-Fat, McG., Shelburn, etc.  I'm not really looking for any serious stuff here.  At the end of a long, day, it's enough mushiness to entertain me.  I actually liked this episode.",1324252800,,609,4.336283185840708
3901457,1,B002BXGIPA,"There were so many things wrong with this episode, I don't even know where to begin.  First, it was hyped as the Hawaii Five-O wedding.  The scenes used in those promos were no where to be seen, and the much hyped wedding lasted just under 2 minutes.

Second, too much story and not enough space to go through it.  It left me kind of confused, and feeling unresolved.  It also cut down the amount of time spent with real character interactions, and really I watch this show for the chemistry between the cast... so definitely bit into my enjoyment of the show.

Third, that Lori person.  Still don't like her, still don't understand why she's in the show (other than as obvious eye candy).  I wish they'd write her out.

All in all, probably the worst Five-0 episode I've seen to date.",1324080000,,785,4.471830985915493
3901458,2,B002BXGIPA,"Admittedly I did not purchase the HD version, but there are spots in this video that come out exceptionally poor even accounting for it being non-HD.  Almost grainy, in fact.  This happens on and off, and is particularly distracting when it occurs during close ups of the characters' expressions.

Otherwise, a decent episode.  Glad to see more of Kono!!",1322697600,,354,4.9491525423728815
3901459,3,B002BXGIPA,"Is it just me, or are they trying to attract more viewers by replacing Kono?  I can't figure out if they're trying to appeal to more guys by adding a ""sexy lady"" type or trying to appeal to girls by putting in a love interest for McGarrett.

Either way, I don't like it.  It's just too obvious a retool for ratings.  Plus, it means a thin Kono story line, and I love Kono (even if she's too skinny to be legit surfer girl!).  Also, I didn't much like the shows usage of Seal Team 9 here.  It felt like they were taking advantage of the Team's popularity for a ratings grab as well.

Other than that, typically Hawaii Five-0: Lots of action, the occasional gaping plot hole or unreasonably illegal police acts, but fun all the same.  Plus, you get to see some gorgeous shots of Hawaii.",1322697600,2,784,4.285714285714286
3901460,5,B002BXGIPA,"The beginning of ""Hawaii Five-O"" Season Two finds the Five-O team disbanded, thanks to an insidious and devastating attack by the gangster Wo Fat at the end of Season One.  Team leader Steve McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) is in jail, accused of murdering the governor.  Kono (Grace Park) is under investigation by HPD internal affairs and facing the loss of her badge.  Danny Williams (Scott Caan) is off the force and mourning the departure from Hawaii of his former wife and child.  Only Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) still has a badge and a chance to put things right.

Help comes in the form of Commander Joe White (Terry O'Quin), McGarrett's former SEAL mentor, who helps Chin Ho resurrect the team.  On probation with the new governor, the team must accept a new member, former FBI agent Lori Weston (Lauren German) who is supposed to ride herd on the unorthodox McGarrett, but who may have another agenda.  Meanwhile, former CIA analyst Jenna Kaye departs the team under mysterious circumstances, as the villainous Wo Fat tidies up the loose ends of his plot.  And how will Kono be redeemed from her banishment?

The second season features the Five-O team tackling exciting crime-of-the-week challenges in Hawaii, while McGarrett continues to pursue the investigation initiated by his father and that resulted in his murder.  However, it appears that investigation is leading to dark, dangerous, and confusing waters involving the CIA, Wo Fat, corrupt officials and perhaps even members of the Five-O team.  Stay tuned for the excitement, including a couple of exciting cross-overs with NCIS-LA's agents.  Season Two is highly recommended to ""Hawaii Five-O"" fans.",1319414400,48,1668,5.091911764705882

3901478,5,B002BXGIPA,"This excellent remake of the original CBS crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O"" features Alex O'Loughlin as Commander Steve McGarrett, the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O, along with Scott Caan portraying his loyal sidekick, Detective Danny Williams. This second season of ""Hawaii Five-O"" continues its depiction of the exploits of Commander Steve McGarrett, Detective Danny Williams, and the other members of the Special Task Force, as they valiantly battle the criminal element in the state of Hawaii. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is characterized by superb writing, acting, and development of its story lines, and the various crime capers are interesting and engaging. In addition, the beautiful Hawaiian scenery is absolutely spectacular. There is a strong camaraderie among the members of the Hawaii Five-O Special Task Force, and the conclusion of each episode with a team dinner on the beach serves to highlight their dedication to the overall mission, and to each other. This remake of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a supremely entertaining crime drama, and I enthusiastically give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485648000,,1160,5.45

3901496,5,B002BXGIPA,"When the all-new Hawaii Five-0 premiered on CBS six years ago, it quickly established itself as a worthy successor to Hawaii Five-O, its 1960s-70s predecessor. The shows premise essentially remained the same both series, although the characters in the new show all received 21st century updates. In both shows, a team of special investigators, appointed by Hawaiis governor, tackles the mission of solving the toughest and most high profile criminal cases.  Steve McGarrett (Alex OLoughlin) leads the Five-0 team, assisted by Detective Danny Williams (Scott Caan), Honolulu police lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), and rookie police officer Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park).

Hawaii Five-0s second season gets off to a rip-roaring start as the Five-0 team deals with the cliffhanger left over from the Season 1 finale. Twenty-two action-packed and suspenseful episodes follow. They include: Kamee (The Hero,) where Five-0 investigates the murder of a Navy SEAL;  Pahele (Trap), where the team takes on a gang of drug dealers that are holding a school bus full of students hostage, while demanding the return of a large shipment of cocaine seized by the police; and Pa Make Loa (Touch of Death), the first half of a two-part cross-over episode with NCIS: Los Angeles, in which Five-0 joins forces with NCIS a desperate search for a bio-terrorist with vials containing the smallpox virus.

Hawaii Five-0s scripts are very well written; most often they combine healthy doses of character-driven crime drama and  generous dollops of technology-driven police procedural. Season 2 delves deeper into the personal lives of each main character. McGarrett and Danny continue their constant light-hearted and friendly squabbles, adding a touch of humor to the show. McGarrett mysteriously disappears for a time, leaving the team to investigate some cases on its own. Danny draws closer to his ex-wife, even though she is now remarried to a wealthy business executive. Both Chin Ho Kelly and Kono Kalakaua find themselves slowly sucked into separate police corruption scandals.

As  Hawaii Five-0s second season clearly demonstrates, here is a show that brings the very best its predecessor had to offer - an original concept, excellent story lines, and Hawaii's magnificent scenery - and transforms them all into a modern-day viewers delight. Highly recommended.",1472601600,,2355,5.365853658536586

There are so many special episodes. I love all the characters; not only are the men strong but the women are, too. They all work so well together and bring those excellent stories together. The writing is fabulous and I enjoy the humor that's interjected and also the holidays they celebrate. The ""history"" lessons are great, too; they make the show even stronger. I have enjoyed watching the guests, famous stars who will be remembered again because they performed beautifully on Hawaii Five-0. (I hope Carol Burnett makes another appearance before she ""dies."") I'd like very much to see Michelle Borth remain a permanent member of their elite force.  And how can one not enjoy seeing Hawaii, Oahu in particular. I visited that Island about six years ago and have been wishing to return. Now I have, vicariously through watching Hawaii Five-0. The scenery is breathtaking and interesting. Not to mention educational. Everything about the show should make one want to tune in every week to watch it. And if you've missed it from the beginning and would like to catch up, don't forget the DVDs you can purchase as I did. (Hint: they make great gifts!)",1433203200,,1321,4.845132743362832

And how about the teen-age-girl bickering between McGarrett and Danno? And of course, all the women cops can do anything the men cops can do, including beating up perps twice their size. While I like the Kono character it's absolutely impossible to suspend my disbelief quite that far (no, women CAN'T do everything men can do and yes, I'm female). And as for the gaping holes in logic throughout the entire series, don't get me started. This is a kids show mentally and emotionally while being way too violent for kids. Seeing people executed in cold blood is not my idea of ""entertainment"".

3901569,5,B002BXGIPA,"I'm really liking the show more as each season goes on. The episodes feel action packed most of the time, and the characters are really likeable.

3901574,5,B002BXGIPA,"WARNING...This will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 yet, skip the first couple paragraphs.

The show kept the footing it established in season 1, with a case of the week for most episodes mixed in with episodes advancing the larger story arcs involving the characters.  It begins shortly after the events of Season 1, with McGarrett in jail (which obviously gets resolved early on), Chin back with HPD, Kono suspended and Danny as a civilian.  The team ultimately is reassembled under order of the new Governor (played by Richard T Jones), but with some revisions.

The big story arcs continues to be the investigation started by Steve's father that played out through season one.  That story introduces the character of Joe White (played by the great Terry O'Quinn from Lost and Alias fame).  It is hard not to see and hear Locke or Kendall when you see him, and whether by intention or coincidence, much like those characters Joe knows more than he is letting on.  The big part of that story that is brought out this season is the identity of Shelburne, who Wo-Fat is trying to find.  Part of that story is resolved by the end of the season and part continues on into season 3.

The other big story arc of the season involves a group of ex dirty cops, headed by Frank Delano (played by William Baldwin) and pursued by ex internal affairs head and new HPD head of detectives Vince Fryer (played by Tom Sizemore).  That story heavily involves Kono and to some extent Chin (especially toward the end of the season).  There is not as much of the Danny/Rachel/Grace storyline this season aside from a couple, very good,  episodes.  For part of the season a new member of the team, Lori Weston (played by Lauren German) is forced in by the Governor as a babysitter to make sure they do not go over the line.

Like in season 1, the show does a good job balancing the story of the week episodes with the arc centric ones.  The show is definitely action heavy, and can be kind of cheesy sometimes, but they also do a good job giving the characters depth and making them likable enough that you get invested in them.  This season they tied into the original series bringing in Ed Asner to reprise his role as smuggler/fence August March.  The season again ends with the team fractured and in trouble with a couple cliffhangers and a big reveal.  There are twists and turns throughout the season and you are not always sure of every characters intentions, but most of them worked really well, and the show did a good job wrapping up the stories that did not work as well or had just become stale or were becoming stale.  There is also a great Max centric episode (Masi Oka is on as a series regular this season) as well as a pretty funny nod to the series Heroes in a scene between Masi Oka and the guest starring Greg Grunberg.  There is also a cross over episode with NCIS Los Angeles where LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnel come to Hawaii and Daniel Dae Kim and Scott Caan go to Los Angeles.  Both show's episodes are included so you see the entire story.  The highlight of the season was probably the guest appearance by James Caan as a private detective working with the team to solve the murder of his friend.

For those who get the blu rays, the series looks and sounds great.  The extras were very similar to what was included on the season 1 release.  Cast and crew commentaries on select episodes, deleted scenes on select episodes a few behind the scenes and making of features and a gag reel.  A lot there for those who like to go through the bonus material.

The show is definitely not everyone's ""cup of tea"", but if you like shows in the genre and liked season 1, then you will very likely enjoy season 2.",1422144000,2,3786,4.455732946298984

3901675,5,B002BXGIPA,"This new McGarret in this remake is bolder, stronger, and more driven than the original. That is not to say that the original was bad, it was actually great. This remake has a chemistry that the original did not have though. The main actors in this show fit together like a glove with a perfect fit. The stories are solid, the acting is great, and the action explosive. This show has it all, action, comedy, love, romance, and of course crime drama. It's the type of show where you can't wait to watch the next episode. And, unlike the first season dvd set, this one translates the Hawaiian titles into English for you.  Well, you got both versions actually. This season picks up exactly where the first season cliff hanger left off and takes off from there, resolving the cliffhanger in the first few minutes of the first episode.

It's a great season, and I highly recommend it.

3901700,3,B002BXGIPA,"They're getting there. I think season one sputtered but two is better, lots of guest stars to amp up the stories. Most shows are variations on movies like Fast and Furious, Big Trouble in Little China, any kidnap story, any drug and drug cartel story. The uber bad guy Woo Fat is the bad guy in Big Trouble and the parade of guest stars who get to go to Hawaii to shoot is immense. I still can't get behind Scott Cann, he always has a face like a walnut and a furrowed bow; it's not real good acting or reacting, oh well. Looks like they are switching out female leads. Good camera and FX work. Some funny moments between old Lost cast mates and JJimmy Buffet as an old chopper pilot is interesting. Bad guys you hate and good guys that grow on you. McGarrett and Danno regularly violate people's civil rights and enjoy doing it. Can't wait to see season3.",1401840000,,856,4.3229813664596275

3901783,5,B002BXGIPA,I really liked the original series and the remake is no different.  I started watching the remake because I really enjoy the acting of Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan.  There is a little bit of everything in this show. The show is also very much about the main characters and what is happening in their lives.,1369094400,,308,4.482142857142857

3901799,5,B002BXGIPA,It seems like most of the rebooted series lack some of their own style. 5-0 takes you back with a twist. The show maintains some of the classic police drama as is sets the viewer in the present. The characters are great together and the shooting locations (Hawaii) are breath taking!  Looking forward to every new episode,1364169600,,321,4.631578947368421

Maybe find some mountain bike trails and rally soak in the beauty of the place. If you need two reasons the second would be for Steve and Danno having their little quarrels, so funny.

3901804,3,B002BXGIPA,"I waited with impatience for the season 2. But... I was a little disappointed! I do not think that bringing a new girl into the team was a good idea. If McGarrett sparkled in the season 1, in this one he is a pale copy of himself. The actress never was a part of the team. The dialogues lost their power, and the stories were less powerful.",1363305600,,340,4.08955223880597

If you are an old 50 fan Jack Lord from 70's you should like the New 50.
The shows are different but both focus on everyday Hawaiian life.
Much has changed in Hawaii since Jack Lord's version, but if you have been to Honolulu Hawaii you will love the new show
because of being filmed in Hawaii. We love recognizing places the new show is filming at and it makes the film interactive for us.
Hope this helps. Thank you.
Blessings,
Phil",1363046400,,515,4.608695652173913

3901808,1,B002BXGIPA,"IF you grew up loving the Jack Lord stuff, chances are you won't like the remake

Likes:
a. the windows cell phones are great and the use of SkyDrive and Surface - that table-top touch screen computer - fun
b. the different firearms are also cool although they seem more military than a police force

Dislikes:
a. tries too hard - so just because Steve used to be Navy SEAL, he's in tactical vests all the time
and he flies choppers too

b. lack of logic - how many times have we seen Steve and Danny dressed in normal clothes
But when then screech-stop and leap out of (another) Chevy, both are in tactical clothes
When and how did this quick change take place?

c. lack of logic Part II - these guys are plain clothes cops but they might as well be in uniform since:
- they always have their shields on their belts
- giant paddle holsters sticking ut
Hawaiian crooks got to be dumb not to spot them

d. lack of logic Part III
So Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett is son of the original Steve, played by Jack Lord
Fair enough
But explain to me (as Danny would say) this:
- is the 'new'Danny Williams son of the Danno played by James Mac?
- is Chin Ho Kelly the son of the original played by Kam Fong?
- Kono, hmmm, did she lose weight and change her gender

I mean, come on, this is really grasping at straws, retaining all the original cast
They're even SO desperate Luke Lukella also appears

Retaining Wo Fat but making him trendily trim - doesn't do it, but that's just me

By all means, do a remake, but please have some respect for the original

The show gets itself into all kinds of spots and loses cred because of the silly premises:
a. Wo Fat killed the original Steve
b. NAVY SEAL Commander Steve's mum is a spy, or maybe not
Because of these 2 dumb assertions, subsequent plots get unbelievable

Things get Rambo-ish further on
With Steve going to an Axis of Evil country
And the rest of 5-o - Rambolike - going to save him

Come on guys",1362009600,,1953,4.265582655826559

They did make a bit of a mess of the menu's though, you have to click on each episode to see if it has any extras so if it doesn't it goes straight into that episode and starts playing. Bit of a pain, CBS need to rethink that.",1359849600,,336,3.8142857142857145

One of the Disc has really poor quality, probably damaged in route due to not being packaged securely. It was not bad enough that I could not watch it, just poor quality on the one disc.

3901829,2,B002BXGIPA,"I am a fan of the original five-0 and this show is a joke to the standards of the old show of the 1970's. The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD.

3901886,5,B002BXGIPA,Wonderful Hawaiian scenery intercut with provocative story lines and a cast that works well together... what more can you ask for?  The addition of Masi Oka as among the series regulars is a big plus.  He adds quirkiness and fun to the wonderful verbal tussles of the two leads (McGarret and Danno).  Not a lot of series showcase Asian-American actors but this show certainly delivers giving both Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim strong story lines.  The only critique would be the sudden departure of Lauren German mid-season...  Here's hoping that this show lives up to its potential as the Third Season unfolds!,1350777600,,611,4.893203883495145

3901889,5,B002BXGIPA,"After the Season 1 finale cliff hanger, I was wondering how the Five-0 team would all be put back together, but it was definitly a fun ride. Alex O'Loughlin is still the perfect Steve McGarrett. He is so good at playing the intensity and focus that would go along with being a Navy Seal, but he also ROCKS the action sequences (doing most of his own stunts) and the emotional scenes. (He is so cute with Danny's daughter Grace.) Danny (Scott Caan) is always there for some comic relief. In fact, one of my favorite episodes of the season was when his dad, James Caan, guest starred in the episode 18th ""Lekio"" as Tony Archer. Their banter was great! Chin Ho and Kono are still great as well. And I love Masi Oka as Dr. Max Bergman!

New to the cast this season are Commander Joe White (Terry O'Quin), McGarrett's former SEAL trainer and mentor; former Homeland Security/FBI agent Lori Weston (Lauren German), who is supposed to ""babysit"" the unorthodox Five-0 team for the new Governor, and former CIA analyst Jenna Kaye (Larisa Oleynik), who is trying to find out if her CIA agent fiance is still alive.

We've just finished watching the season and enjoyed it very much.  While each episode has the same characters in it, there is a resolution to the episodes dilemma each show.  The larger theme carries through the season, but it is satisfying to see results in every episode.",1350086400,,513,4.483870967741935
3901892,2,B002BXGIPA,"While comparisons between the original Hawaii Five-O and the reboot series are inevitable, both shows are actually quite different in characterization and style. In fact Version 2.0 probably is closer to CSI: Miami than the Jack Lord version. Hmmm, CSI: Hawaii.

It is kind of hard to see it today but the classic series was rather pioneering for the time - the location filming and the liberal use of local, non-white actors was unusual in the late 1960s. Of more importance were the excellent stories ranging from the bones of Peking Man, to Red Chinese agents, to residual intrigues left over from Pearl Harbor. Granted there were cheesy episodes and the last couple of seasons were lacking. But overall the original was excellent by all measures.

The new series lacks the distinctive character of the original. It isn't any different than any of the other police procedural shows airing in the early 2000s, with the shaky camera shots, faux forensic and computer science, and sappy character back stories. Heck the show even has the requisite lab guy with a cane. How can you have a 2000s-era police show without the handicapped/eccentric lab or computer expert? The tropical setting and the saturated color palette is reminiscent of CSI Miami although Alex O'Loughlin is a much better actor than David Caruso is. And the new Five-0 isn't as over-the-top as CSI: Miami, although the way Wo Fat was broken out of custody was on par with amount of cheese.

Even Reza Badiyi's famed opening credits of the classic Five-O doesn't escape the attention span-challenged reworking of the new series. The credits of the original series (which originally ran right after a dramatic intro sequence) ran a full minute and promised the exotic essence of the show. The new version cuts this down to 30 seconds and crams in so many visuals to make it look as if it was designed by a monkey on a weekend sugar binge. The presentation of the opening credits feel more like it is going through the motions than offering any enticement to the show.

One positive of the show is to give the supporting characters more of a role. Kono, Chin Ho, Duke, Ben, and Che of the original didn't nearly have the kind of proactive role they could've or should've. Too bad the character back stories are rather banal.

The new Steve McGarrett looks like he needs a shower - unshaven with shirt unbuttoned. A far cry to the buttoned-down appearance of the original McGarrett but clearly an attempt to appeal to female viewers (just as the new Kono is eye-candy for male viewers). And the new Danno is just plain grating. However some of the banter between the two is occasionally entertaining. I like Daniel Dae Kim as Chin Ho, but Grace Kim just can't fill the original Kono's shoes (literally or figuratively).

Bottom line: Hawaii Five-0 2.0 is just another typical cop show circa 2010, guilty of following the same formula. Book-em Danno.",1349740800,2,2914,4.818

""Hawaii Five-O: The Second Season""
---------------------------------------------------------------
By the end of Season One, the rebooted 2.0 version of ""Hawaii Five-O"" had moved out of an adventure-of-the-week format into a more melodramatic, ongoing political-conspiracy story arc, which is picked up again at the start of Season Two.

Shot in bright, vivid, richly saturated colors and making the most of the exotic island locales, the new Five-O is a fun, propulsive modern cop show, with the same sort of glitzy lack of logic that made ""Miami Vice"" a camp classic. The cast is packed with great character actors, including Daniel Dae Kim and his ""Lost"" co-star Terry O'Quinn; Grace Park (of ""Battlestar Galactica""); ""Buffy"" fave James Marsters and Masi Oka hamming it up as a CSI labbie who dreams of being Columbo. The show is fun and delivers on the action while never taking itself too seriously. Lots of great footage of Oahu (and some of the other islands) and enough bikinis and sixpack abs to satisfy the shallowest of TV viewers. I'm definitely looking forward to Season Three!

3901902,5,B002BXGIPA,"Season Two of the new Five-O was fantastic, hands down. No let-down from Season One, in fact, maybe stronger in some ways.
The DVD set has deleted scenes and commentary from actors/directors/producers on many of the episodes. The crossover episode

The final disc contains several bonus featurettes, including an inter-active tour of the locations on Oahu where the episodes
were filmed - showing clips from the episodes and interviews with cast members and guest stars (including Jimmy Buffett,
Ed Asner, James Caan and Tom Sizemore). The usual behind-the-scenes and gag reel are also included, along with a
featurette on the action and stunts of Season Two. Picture and sound are the best there is on TV these days, so buy it now.",1348185600,,851,4.916666666666667

3901912,4,B002BXGIPA,"I like to refer to McGarrett as ""Supersteve,"" and in this episode, he earns that name! I'ts ridiculous, but fun to watch. He gets stabbed in the stomach, overpowers the EMTs in the ambulance and jumps out (while it's moving!), climbs a fence, overpowers a cop and steals his squad car, and makes it to Max's apartment before collapsing. Whew!! After a few minutes' rest, he continues to run around, trying to find the person who shot the governor. When he finds out the perpetrator might be escaping on a boat, he, Chin and Danny hop into speedboat and give chase. When they catch the yacht, Steve leaps onto it, tumbles once and plugs a bad guy. Now, that's a long day even for Supersteve!
I think the series needs the action to make up for the writing. The cast is attractive, the location is attractive, but the writing leaves much to be desired. I still watch it and I may buy the second season on DVD just so I can watch the skydiving stunt that's in a later episode over and over! Most excellent skydiving stunt ever on TV!!

It makes it a little more interesting sometimes but I just really hope that they don't continue it throughout season three.  I love Alex and Scott and think that they are amazing in this show and love the banter between Steve and Danny.  I just hope the writers don't continue to make the next season not as good as the one before.

3901915,5,B002BXGIPA,"Season 2 of Hawaii Five-0 was just as great as season 1, with the exception of the addition of Lori.  Nothing against the actress, but the character was dry and did not mesh at all with the existing team.  For a while I felt as though the writers were trying to stick her in every scene, and I started to tune her out entirely.  It got to the point when I was just HOPING they'd kill her off.  However, scenes that excluded Lori were wonderful, strong, and just plain good entertainment.
The first episode of the season was AMAZING.  It had lots of twists and turns that I never expected (the final scene actually made me gasp).  The Lori-less episodes were the strongest of the season (along with the Lori-less scenes), filled with action, suspense, humor and of course the Steve and Danny carguments.  They made up for the first half of the season big time.  The season finale was also a big highlight of the season - just when you thought the episode was coming to a close, there were two huge cliffhangers that had us looking forward to season 3.
I liked the addition of Joe and all of the guest stars, especially James Caan.  I also enjoyed the crossover episodes with NCIS: LA and hope that the NCIS: LA episode is included in the DVD so everyone can see how the crossover story concluded.
Also, big kudos to the writers and actors who were able to seamlessly put together two episodes without the main character, Steve, due to Alex O'Loughlin's temporary leave.  Though his presence was missed in the episodes, the writers did such a good job with the other characters and they didn't just hastily mention Steve wasn't around - they pretty much developed a story about his absence.
All in all I can say a handful of episodes were weak, yet still good, but the rest of the episodes were even better than those in season 1.  Don't base the season on the first few episodes because you'll miss out on a great show if you do.",1339113600,13,1928,4.448863636363637
3901916,4,B002BXGIPA,"NO SPOILERS!

Of all of the TV that I watch (including DVD's of foreign programming) there are very few US network programs that I pull off the DVR shortly after an episode is completed.  Hawaii Five-0 is on that short list.

I partially agree with other reviewers that at times, season 2 falls short of season 1.  However, the last 4-episodes are very-very good.

I always have mixed emotions re: series that end the season with a cliff-hanger.  However, with that said, I most definitely did not see this one coming and there are actually several cliff-hangers.

I have heard that eye candy personified, Michelle Borth (once dubbed as ""the nakedest person in TV history"") will have a more permanent role in season 3, as Steve's (US Navy) girlfriend.  She will compliment nicely the Grace Park ""pout"" =:)

This is one of a handful of network programs where I will actually be looking forward to the new season.",1339027200,2,911,4.715189873417722

Danny is caught by the CIA trying to solve the murder of a CIA agent, and trying to help McG get back safely from Japan.  The CIA is involved in this one and they get caught-maybe or maybe not, in bed with WoFat.  Incidentally, I've come to appreciate Alex O's (McGarrett) acting more and more.

The second episode of Season two it all fell apart.  I have no idea who thought Lauren German was the right person to add to the cast (when it should just be the original four anyway) because she was as exciting to watch as watching paint dry.  I can think of a thousand other actresses who would have done a much better job and who would have actually had chemistry with the main stars.  Because of Alex, Grace, Scott, and Daniel I forced myself to watch the show because I kept praying someone would come to their senses and kill off Lori Weston( Lauren). All the lines that should have been Grace's went to Lauren and there was just nothing she couldn't do.  It was ridiculous. It took a while but once she was gone the show started to get back to what I liked about it in the first place.  The guess stars were awesome.  I so hope they bring back Scott Caan's dad James because he just nailed his role.  Alex missed a couple of episodes and he was so missed.  Hopefully season three they will get better writers and we can get the show rocking like it did in season one.",1335830400,8,1225,4.218884120171674

Not enough vision in my opinion.  But, the bickering between Steve and Danno...ahhhhh, good to have that back, though in this ep. there wasn't near enough.  I've stopped watching the show because of the blonde.  Just waiting for her to get written out.  It seems that's happened, so, I'm back, but was bored with this ep.

3901933,2,B002BXGIPA,"I'm a big fan of Five-0. However, this episode seemed too thrown together.  Ed Asner was cool, and the flashbacks were fine, but I didn't really see the point to having him there, or even his character.  Bringing in the dirty cop, Kalea, from earlier episodes, didn't really make sense either.  It's like they just needed another bad guy to make the story fly and so they brought him in.  Also the whole play-out of diamond story was interesting, but was too predictable.  McGarret's sister was framed, the guy who threatened her was in cahoots with her friend who got the stewardess job, wow!  Surprise.

The one meaty thread through the story, however, was the regular insinuations that Captain Friar (Tom Sizemore) was dirty.  If it wasn't evident to you before, then this episode will at least point you towards that conclusion.  Who knows?  Maybe this episode is setting up further story-lines.  We'll see.  But left something to be desired on this episode.

Who else but Alex could step into the shoes of an iconic character - and make that character better than the original?  The man can do anything on film, and the fact that Alex does most of his own stunts makes it even more exciting to watch.

Alex himself has said how he wouldn't ever want to do a ""procedural"" crime drama, and he and the writers have managed to make it so much more than that.  The show has action, the gorgeous background of Hawaii, a stellar cast - and one of my favorite things about the show is the humor.  The ""carguments"" between Steve and Danny never get old, I just love them.

The characters that had started off in Season One as a united family, occasional fun and humorous story lines have degenerated into dark, brooding characters and story lines.  Are the writers afraid if one of the characters smiles it will ruin the story???  If there is a Season Three, I sincerely hope they return to the old format.  I don't want one theme or mystery running through an entire season and carrying over into the next season.  I want to see a crime drama that has a story and then wraps everything up in one episode.",1328486400,16,708,4.457364341085271
3901938,2,B002BXGIPA,"I am currently on the fence about this item. The sophmore season of Hawaii 5-O, in my opinion, has fallen far short of my hopes and expectations after such a great first season.

Season 1 had action, mystery and a fair bit of comedy. We learned that Ohana meant family and the 4 main cast members made us believe in their family.

Season 2...not so much. During the summer break they managed, in my opinion, to lose the magic. The cliff hanger from S1 was resolved far too quickly and the sense of Ohana has all but disappeared.

My issues with this season?
1)The new governor wanted accountability, so how did he hold Steve accountable for the  prison guard, paramedic, and police officer he knocked out??

2)They introduce a new character who is supposed to report back to the governor when 5-O crosses the line. Unless the writers are going to take the lazy way out and say she has been doing it off screen, she has yet to fulfill her duty to the governor. In fact they have done a disservace to the actress by basically giving her a roll that has no depth and seems to be of no real value to the show, other than to disrupt the sense of family and camaraderie between the 4 main cast members.

3)Instead of showing the team slowly coming to trust her, after the 1st ep she is immediatly accepted as one of them.

Overall my biggest disappointment has been the loss of the sense of ohana, the missed opportunities (they could have done so much more with the whole Danny bunking with Steve)the way they had Danny behave at the Hawaiian burial ground, (and not showing any repercussions from Chin and Kono he insulted their culture)and the continued efforts of the writers to make us think that the Lori character is a female Steve. Enough already.

There are still several episodes left so I will remain hopeful that they get back to basics and make this season worth buying the dvds.",1327536000,23,1886,4.494152046783626
