8497239,3,B006FYR800,"Recently purchased this product-the winter scenes for the most part are indeed as advertised-good movement of camera shots so the scenery is constantly changing which in general is a good thing-the problem I have with this product is the editing-The video is divided into themed segments which is fine but within the segments the winter landscape will suddenly morph into a springlike or even summerlike scene with no obvious connection-I know the filmmaker had some metaphor in mind but it doesn't make sense in most cases-It is almost impossible to imagine what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish at times-In short, we need more winter shots and much less spring and summer contrast. Also, I would expect the opening segment of a video entitled ""winter wonderland to open with some spectacular winter nature scene of some sort-not so here-we are treated to a very light snow flurry falling on some dingy city streetscape-the confusion begins right out of the gate--Even so,as stated earlier, the actual winter mountain scenery is at times spectacular, just wish there was more of it.",1387670400,,1091,5.100558659217877
