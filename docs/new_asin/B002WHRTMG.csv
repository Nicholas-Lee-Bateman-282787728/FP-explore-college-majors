4006931,5,B002WHRTMG,I wasn't sure what this DVD was all about. It was very interesting how it was told. It was something from the '80's like the movies they spoke of. The end was surprising. It was a good movie for those who really liked those movies from that writer.,1349222400,,248,4.1875
4006932,1,B002WHRTMG,Not worth the $5.99 I paid for it. Rent it or watch it online first before you buy. I had a hard time staying awake.,1319760000,,116,3.68
4006933,3,B002WHRTMG,"As the other 3 reviewers have stated, this is a small treasure for those of us who happened to experience our high school years right along with the creations of Mr. Hughes.  I must also echo that there was more attention paid to the filmmakers than I would have liked, but the interviews that are available here are more than I had ever hoped to see in one place.

I saw this on Netflix Instant and couldn't help but wonder:  are there any extra interviews included on the actual disc?  If so, I may be inclined to purchase.",1305504000,,525,4.326530612244898
4006934,4,B002WHRTMG,"I love John Hughes, and I am very happy I purchased this DVD documentary.  I've watched it three times as of this writing, with many more to go.

That said, I don't think most of you will be happy you purchased this.  However, you will enjoy this film.  It contains great interviews with some unlikely collaborators and actors.  There are a few key folks missing.  Among them are Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Matthew Broadrick.

The ""quest"" of the film makers to find John Hughes in the Chicago burbs is anticlimactic.  This type of ""quest"" story worked great in the film ""My Date with Drew,"" but it doesn't work here.  The interviews and narrative of John's life are well worth the time investment, though.

Hope this helps!  Enjoy!",1286928000,2,745,4.6976744186046515
4006935,4,B002WHRTMG,"There's some nice interviews with the many actors who have worked with Hughes, and it's interesting to hear their insights on the way he worked and perhaps some of the reasons he decided to leave the business. It mainly documents the team's journey to find Hughes and not much else.",1271462400,2,282,4.66

Prior to watching this film I wasn't well informed on who John Hughes was or what he did. But there is one thing I did know: the 80's are synonymous with ""John Hughes films"" and this film explained why.

My wife is a big fan of these movies so when I saw that this documentary was available streaming via NetFlix I queued it up and we watched it together. Like a lot of amateur documentaries too much of the film consists of conversations between the producers instead of interviews with the principles. Even so, the film is illuminating for novice Hughes fans, like myself, and an entertaining walk down memory lane to long time fans, like my wife. At the end of the film, our knowledge of Hughes' work and our appreciation for what the filmaker meant to several generations is clearly understood and felt.

I recommend it to all fans of Hughes work and those who have heard of him but haven't yet realized how much he has influenced their lives.",1264809600,11,1717,6.835616438356165
8383085,2,B002WHRTMG,They never get to talk to him. What was the point? It didn't suck. It just didn't deliver anything useful.,1500076800,,106,4.35

8383088,3,B002WHRTMG,"Interesting interviews with some of the people behind the John Hughes films (as well as the fans). The documentary includes interviews with some of the stars and other notable film personalities- absent from this documentary were Molly Ringwald and Michael Anthony Hall (the recently released book, John Hughes, A Life in Film, provides a more clear insight into their absence and into the John Hughes ""mystique""). Overall, it would probably please hard core Hughes fans.",1432339200,,471,5.293333333333333

8383090,3,B002WHRTMG,"Thankfully, I saw this on TV, so I don't have to feel bad about paying to see it. Most of it was cool, but the hunt was what made me not like it. I grew up watching John Hughes movies, I was introduced to them by my older cousins (I was born in 1984).  I liked the interviews from the casts of his movies, but Hughes has contributed enough, he didn't need to be hounded by these pretentious film students.  By the end I was hoping they wouldn't get in touch with him.  He obviously knows how deeply people feel about his movies and he chose not to be in the public eye for a reason.  If it hadn't had the whole search, I would have liked it a lot more.

8383093,3,B002WHRTMG,"Just as described, brand new I thought this movie was going to be interviewed by the actors of the brat pack, but it was really good I enjoyed it, since its kinda of a tribute to Hohn hughes",1353715200,,190,4.026315789473684
8383094,3,B002WHRTMG,"Insightful commentary from filmmakers and actors of the time and/or the genre, and a fun collage of clips from the great Hughes films.

This is good nostalgia if you love the Hughes films, but it's not a great documentary. As a fan of the Hughes films, I want to agree with these filmmakers as they reminisce, but much of their original material, from filming to writing, is somewhat weak -- although the editing is good. The comparison to movies of today is interesting if it can be substantiated: that teenagers identified with the Hughes movies in their time in a way that teenagers cannot identify with the movies and television of today. This seems to be the central viewpoint of the film, and it does gain some support and traction as the movie progresses. Expert insight comes from an array of filmmakers and actors who were there at the time or otherwise relevant to the topic, the profession, and John Hughes. Their collective commentary on corporate, product-driven Hollywood is significant.
There are no interviews with John Hughes himself -- nor Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Jon Cryer, or Matthew Broderick -- but you do hear from: Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Gedde Watanabe, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, and Kelly LeBrock, as well as Kevin Smith, among many others. The closing remarks directed at John Hughes are endearing.

These enterprising filmmakers deserve credit for getting their project done, but I would not recommend this film on its own merits. I enjoyed it as someone who loves the Hughes films since seeing them in the theaters in 1984-1986 as I went from junior high to high school. These movies were influential. If you relate the same way, this is almost like a supplemental title to the original movies, which you'll watch for the millionth time because they capture a particular time and place. For big John Hughes fans this is a welcome addition to the movies themselves.",1350345600,6,1958,4.930303030303031
