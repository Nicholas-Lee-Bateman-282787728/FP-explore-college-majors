5190504,5,B0071IUMK2,"I have always had a soft spot for Columbo, and with Father's Day approaching, thought it would be a gift for my husband.  We didn't wait for Father's Day, and have watched all the episodes, wish there were more.  I guess it is hard to get enough of these detective stories.  I might have to purchase more.",1402444800,2,305,4.315789473684211

5190507,5,B0071IUMK2,"Herein one gets ""tude in Black"" with John Cassavetes, ""A Stitch in Crime"" with Leonard Nimoy, ""The Most Dangerous Match"" with Laurence Harvey and ""Double Shock"" with Martin Landau.

But the real treasures here are:
""The Greenhouse Jungle"" with the great Ray Milland

""The Most Crucial Game"" starring Robert Culp as the general manager of a L.A. football team. Great line of Columbo: ""That ding-a-ling ice cream. Don't ever change that.""

""Dagger of the Mind""  is a great episode with Columbo in London! (ably assisted by John Williams, Richard Basehart,  Honor Blackman, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and my favorite Bernard Fox playing Detective Chief Superintendent William Durk).",1379376000,7,672,5.3619047619047615

5190519,5,B0071IUMK2,"What can possibly be said about the best murder mystery program ever created? Columbo is the finest and most entertaining series of this genre, and it has certainly stood the test of time. Although the fashions have changed, and police work has become more scientific, I prefer watching a true detective solve the crime by using his brain. Portraying an air of disorganization and incompetence, Columbo successfully lures the criminals into a false sense of superiority and security. Meanwhile, as they let their guard down, the Lieutenant skilfully ties up any loose ends and brings the hammer down when least expected. A master of the game, Peter Falk is superb and I dare say we will never see the likes of him again.

Episodes I can (and have) watched over and over again! Thank you, Lieutenant Columbo!",1454371200,2,807,4.890510948905109

8532370,5,B0071IUMK2,"Several shows rotated in the ""NBC Mystery Movie"" series in the Seventies, and one of the most popular was ""Columbo.""  Peter Falk starred as Los Angeles Police Lieutenant Columbo, an intuitive and tenacious homicide detective.  This DVD set contains all eight episodes of the second season of ""Columbo"" that aired from September 1972 to March 1973.

In each episode, the viewer saw the crime committed and then saw Columbo gradually close in on the solution by asking excellent questions and making incisive observations, so this was not a whodunit series.  In this season, one episode takes place in London and the detective briefly travels to Las Vegas in another.  Anne Baxter, Leonard Nimoy, and Dabney Coleman guest star during the season, and making a cameo appearance in one of the episodes were some of the then-defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers, including a sideburned Pat Riley.

In addition to the great writing, the viewer gets to see the cool period cars, clothes, and public buildings.  ""Columbo"" is one of the most acclaimed detective dramas in television historythose who remember its initial run would enjoy revisiting it, and those in the under-40 age bracket who love detective shows but have never seen ""Columbo"" would likely be glad they investigated it.",1499212800,,1282,5.105263157894737
8532371,5,B0071IUMK2,"What else can be said--it's classic Columbo.  ""Ahh...just one more thing"".  He definitely remains a dog that won't let go of his bone.",1495670400,,134,4.782608695652174

8532375,5,B0071IUMK2,"We absolutely LOVE the DVD's of the old Columbo Series.  We order one season at a time and on nights when there is nothing on worth watching - which is often - we spend the evening with Columbo - ""OH and one more thing - :-)  we've never regretted buying these one season at a time. :-)
We are doing the same with the Mentalist Seasons - ordering one season at a time.  LOVE these DVD's and it makes it so nice - on nights when nothing good is on - to have these to fall back on ...",1488499200,,482,3.8484848484848486
