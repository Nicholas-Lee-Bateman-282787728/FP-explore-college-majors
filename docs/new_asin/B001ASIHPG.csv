8279516,5,B001ASIHPG,"Who, you may ask, is Ben Corbett? Well, he's a character actor that's appeared in countless B-Westerns on both sides of the law. He's probably best known as ""MAGPIE"" in a series of Tim McCoy's LIGHTENIN' BILL CARSON oaters. He's the second bananna/sidekick who holds his own and helps things along. He's middle-aged, rather dumpy with a potbelly, but manages to get things done.
In the first movie here, Bill Cody's BORDER MENACE (1934), Ben plays the guy in the cell that relates through flashback how Bill Cody set him up in order to infiltrate the gang. Ben escapes in enough time to expose Cody as the two-timin', back-stabbin' hero that he is. George Chesebro shines as chief henchie Chuck Adams (there should've been an Academy Award for guys like Chesebro!) And, YES, once again Bill Cody's hat is way-TOO BIG for his head. He even removes it in an action scene!
In movie #2, CIRCLE OF DEATH (1935), Ben plays the chief henchman who, in a running gag, keeps getting tied up to his horse all the time. Ben Corbett is an ordinary average-looking kindda paunchy guy who is just plain likable. He just happens to be a dastardly thug in both of these films.
In CIRCLE OF DEATH, Monte Montana, a somewhat wooden actor, does ok as a white child brought into adulthood by Indians who adopted him after attacking and destroying a wagon train heading for the promised land. I liked this one better, but that's really just a personal preference.
In the world of B-Westerns, plot matters little. What you need to know here is that both (ALPHA dvd) movies look pretty good, are somewhat clear with an audible track that doesn't sound as if it's been submerged under the Atlantic ocean. The usual scratches, jumps, cuts, etc., exist.
A TRUE Ben Corbett film-fest double feature!
