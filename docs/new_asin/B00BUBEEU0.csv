5674676,2,B00BUBEEU0,"A childish drama about a girl who finds a series of love letters in library books. She gets infatuated with the letters and falls in love with the anonymous writer while ignoring another guy who is already interested in her. Overall, there might be one emotional scene, at best. Wasn't worth my time but it was fun seeing the main female actress in a different film setting (she was also in Cloud Atlas).",1368144000,3,404,4.5479452054794525
5674677,2,B00BUBEEU0,"I had such high hopes for ""Spring Bears Love"", but this movie falls flat and is the epitome of corny movies that have no point and a weak story. You're better off watching these legendary Korean movies:
1. Castaway on the Moon
2. The Art of Seduction
3. Love Impossible
4. Shotgun Love",1435449600,,285,4.39622641509434

5674680,5,B00BUBEEU0,"I am not one for writing reviews. Story starts off a little slow but picks up some steam towards the end. Despite knowing how it is going to end, you keep watching until the end.",1417651200,,178,4.114285714285714
5674681,4,B00BUBEEU0,"Well.... I fell in love with the coverart but, alas, it was nothing like the movie. Cute film if you love kdrama.",1413331200,,113,4.181818181818182
5674682,5,B00BUBEEU0,"To be able to truly love, one has to overcome the imperfection of vanities and courageously peel off the layers of masks to show the beautiful you.  I enjoyed that sensation in this gem of a movie.",1407024000,,197,4.324324324324325
5674683,4,B00BUBEEU0,"I thought it was an enjoyable, pleasant movie. I Always enjoy any movie with Bae Doona. She is one of my favorite actresses.",1393977600,3,124,4.434782608695652
5674684,2,B00BUBEEU0,I liked the concept of the movie but some of the characters were rather annoying and the story moved along slowly. The ending though had a nice twist.,1393718400,,150,4.392857142857143
5674685,4,B00BUBEEU0,What do you do when none of your arranged dates ever want to date?  Who is this person writing notes in library books?  Are they for you?  If you love her will you help in the search to hand her off to someone else?  What do trains and bears and a first love have to do with this anyway.  This movie is delightful!,1373068800,3,314,3.9206349206349205
5674686,4,B00BUBEEU0,"What if you thought someone was interested in you - But they weren't really?

A case of mistaken identity, not noticing the people who do love you while you chase the people who don't, cute actors do a fairly good job of telling the story... held my interest.",1369267200,5,259,4.395833333333333
8573962,2,B00BUBEEU0,The female was so dense that you could not like her !,1497139200,,53,3.5
8573963,3,B00BUBEEU0,"It had some of the over the top characteristics that are legendary to Korean cinema. Unfortunately I felt that it just fell short of what I had hoped. It certainly wasn't helped by the subtitles. It would appear that person didn't feel they were paid enough to do their job properly. I don't understand enough Korean (particularly if the person speaks quickly) to make it through an entire movie but I understand enough to know that that person didn't do the best job. Yes, some translations are difficult as with most languages but this one really was sticking me throughout and is the major culprit for 3 stars instead of more. They did a nice job of really rolling through the seasons to frame the timeline. It felt natural through the film.",1494633600,,744,4.643939393939394
8573964,1,B00BUBEEU0,Wasn't a fan of the movie,1489449600,,25,3.3333333333333335
8573965,4,B00BUBEEU0,Again the front picture shows more than you will see in the movie. A good finding love story about a brash girl who scares off most of her possibilities.,1484697600,,153,4.310344827586207
8573966,3,B00BUBEEU0,Better than watching Kardashians,1474848000,2,32,7.25
8573967,5,B00BUBEEU0,I enjoyed the movie.  I don't speak there language but the subtitles was easy to follow through.  It is a funny movie and cute as well.,1473292800,,135,4.153846153846154
8573968,4,B00BUBEEU0,"I really liked this movie. I thought it was funny in some parts and sad in others. I could really relate to the main guy, because I'm just an average dude myself. He's in love with his dream woman, but of course she wants someone better. Ain't it always the case? Anyway this movie stars Bae Doona, who I think is one of the cutest girls in the world, so it's worth watching just to see her in her cashier's outfit and glasses.",1463184000,,427,4.156626506024097
8573969,3,B00BUBEEU0,"The premise is somewhat interesting, albeit not entirely original and rather predictable. My biggest issue with the movie was the female lead. I couldn't sympathize with her character because she was so egocentric and one-dimensional. I was constantly baffled by what the male lead found so appealing about her. Maybe the message of the film should of been: ""love is blind?""",1450742400,2,374,5.147540983606557
8573970,4,B00BUBEEU0,Enjoyed the movie.,1448064000,,18,5.333333333333333
