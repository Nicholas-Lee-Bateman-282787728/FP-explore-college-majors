2548301,5,B000F1IQI2,"...and so far, season two is better than season three.

Season two is where Vincent Chase (played by Adrian Grenier) comes into his own. He's now on the verge of superstar status as he goes from acting in Sundance hit ""Queens Boulevard"" to potentially starring in ""Aquaman"", a James Cameron blockbuster. But there's one thing standing in the way of his success... his leading lady in ""Aquaman"" (Mandy Moore) is the one love he never got over. And now she's engaged to another man.

This conflict creates great storylines for the last few episodes of the season. The entire ""Aquaman"" film is in jeopardy because of his obsession with Moore.

Meanwhile, his brother Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon) is still struggling to resuscitate his own acting career in the shadow of his successful baby brother, and his ""one hit wonder"" status starring in 90's TV show ""Viking Quest"". One of the best episodes of season two is when Drama visits the comic convention in San Diego, where he still has some semblance of fame. A classic.

Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) and Eric (Kevin Connolly) continue their struggle to grow their careers in Vince's superstar shadow. One classic episode has Turtle trying to sign rap star ""Saigon"" after Saigon steals Eric's Maserati, mistaking it for a record producer's car that he wanted to leave a demo CD in.

Eric, on the other hand, is busy learning the ins and outs of Hollywood as he tries to manage Vince's career. He falls for Vince's agent Ari's partner's daughter. Follow me?

This brings me to Vince's agent Ari. (Jeremy Piven)

Ari is the comic relief of the show and accurately portrays every sleazy Hollywood agent you've ever met. He's cruel. He's cold. He's calculating. He has a razor edged tongue and you love to hate him. In season two, Ari shines. He has some of his best one liners ever. (How do you top ""Let's hug it out...!""?

New characters include Lloyd (Rex Lee), Ari's gay Asian assistant and Sloan (Emanuelle Chriqui), Eric's girlfriend and the daughter of Ari's ex-partner.

Season two shines. Great writing. Great story lines. And best of all - you can believe that all of these scenes actually happened to Mark Wahlberg. (Upon whom the series is based)

I recently convinced a female friend who was a die-hard ""Sex and the City"" fan to check out ""Entourage"" after ""Sex and the City"" went off the air. She was hesitant to get into a show about a bunch of ""guys in Hollywood"", but after two episodes she was hooked.

You really do like these guys, and season two makes you understand them even more.

5 stars. (If I could give ""Entourage"" 6 stars, I would)",1151712000,3,2596,4.706401766004415
2548302,2,B000F1IQI2,"I found that your enjoyment of Entourage. 2 is proportional to how much you A) savor a good tabloid read, B) trust in cool product placements, C) love celebrity cameos and D) yearn for more insider trivia on IMDB. After enjoying the first season, I wanted more from this group. But season 2 gave me the sensation of eating too much cookie dough. Everyone is so beautiful and the music is so good, and gosh, the celebrity cameos are really just the best! Dreams of Laker games, beach parties at Jamie Pressly's house, and Sundance sustain me in times of grief and pain. Thank god I waited for this on video. I found myself fast-forwarding through the same endless weed drenched I-can't-get-la*d rich white boy whining just to get to Piven - who blows everyone away. Piven and the absolute skewering of Harry Knowles barely save this thing from being this decade's equivalent to 90210.",1150934400,3,883,4.703225806451613
2548303,5,B000F1IQI2,"Last summer I watched the whole first season of Entourage in one sitting, costing myself half a night's sleep. This summer, I snatched up the second season as soon as it was available on DVD and watched the whole thing in a few days. The show is as addictive as eating potato chips. I'm strongly tempted to get digital cable and subscribe to HBO just to keep up with season three but I can't bring myself to do it. You have to draw the line somewhere and watching the episodes back to back is an unmitigated joy.

This season centers on Vince starring in a big screen adaptation of the comic book Aquaman. The movie will be directed by James Cameron and Cameron needs to be convinced that Vince is right for the leading role. Subplots involve Vince's romance with the film's leading lady, Mandy Moore, Turtle's fledgling career as a music talent agent and political infighting at Ari's agency. Highlights for the season include the boys taking a trip to Utah for the premiere of Vince's indy movie, Queens Boulevard, the guys attending a party at the Playboy mansion, the group attending Ari's daughter's Bat Mitzvah and the gang visiting a comic book convention where Vince will promote his new movie and Drama will milk whatever fame is left from his stint on Viking Quest. All of these episodes are hilarious.

To be honest, the season wasn't flawless. It became too bogged down in Vince's on-again off-again relationship with Mandy Moore. What I like best about this show is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It works best when the guys are put into humorous situations and we get to see them react to them. It should be more a sitcom, like Seinfeld, then a dramatic show. Even so, the show is still better than most of what's on television and I will certainly be back next summer for season three.",1150416000,2,1812,4.606811145510836
2548304,5,B000F1IQI2,This collection is awesome. Amazing adventures experienecd by a  cast of varied personalities. You will laugh and smile and talk about these episodes at work for weeks after you watch!,1147219200,2,184,5.133333333333334
2548305,5,B000F1IQI2,"For anyone planning a move to Hollywood to work in the film business, ""Entourage-The Complete Second Season"" is your video reference to success.  In this very clever and slyly entertaining show, the Hollywood adventures of four pals from Queens reminds me of an updated and inverted version of a classic MGM musical from years ago ""On The Town,"" in which three sailors have only 24 hours to discover New York and all its possibilities.  Fortunately for all concerned, our ""Entourage"" foursome have their HBO contracts and the creative talents of all connected with the show to discover and explore the intricacies and mysteries of the Hollywood movie scene.  As to the nuts and bolts of ""Entourage"", struggling actors and their helpful friends and associates achieve phenomenal levels of success along with an ample slice of what makes for an exciting movie life - both good and not so good.  But when you're young and bullet proof like Vince, Johnny, Turtle and E, all things are possible to include always finding a parking space in front of your favorite club or restaurant and driving a car with a perpetually clean windshield in good old 'air you can see' L.A.  What more could you ask for?",1146614400,9,1195,4.838235294117647
2548306,5,B000F1IQI2,"I tried to explain this show to somebody the other day, and the most appropriate description that I could come up with was ""Entourage is like the male version of 'Sex & The City', but based in Hollywood and with a more clearly defined plot.""  So, yeah... that's pretty much it.

If you watch one episode and enjoy it, then you MUST try to watch the whole series in its' entirety.  Sure, you could jump in and start watching at any time, but the only way that you'll appreciate the inside jokes and past references is to see it from front to back.  The show's writers really get into a great rhythm around the middle of season two.

In my opinion, the REAL stars of this series are Johnny Drama, Turtle, and Ari.  Sure, the relationship between Eric (aka 'E') and movie star Vince is the engine that drives the show, but the funniest moments in the show involve the other members of the entourage.  'E' tends to take himself a little too seriously, and his girl problems are rather contrived at times.  Vince is certainly the center of attention in his little universe because everything hinges on his career, but he couldn't function without his support group - which is the point of the show, I think.

My favorite facet of the show is how everybody that they interact with on a regular basis are all stereotypical entertainment industry people; from the sycophantic personal assistants and ubiquitous groupies, to the slick and smarmy super-agents and power mad producers.  Also, the nature of the show's Hollywood locale results in the inclusion of tons of great Star Cameos.

Entourage was one of the few shows in recent memory that had me laughing out loud and actually giving a crap about what happened to the characters as the story developed.  I can't wait to see what goes down in Season Three.  If you'd like a solid TV drama/comedy that's got a shot of testosterone, or if you're tired of your girl forcing you to sit through re-runs of 'Sex & The City' and want to make her watch something you BOTH might enjoy for a change, then you should check out Entourage.",1145577600,35,2073,4.57027027027027
2548307,5,B000F1IQI2,"One day My cousin was over my house and turned on the TV and started watching this HBO series called ""Entourage"". He gave me the main synopsis of the show- There is Vince Chase, the actor and his entourage- Eric ""E"" Murphy, his childhood best Friend and now his manager. Johhny ""Drama"" Chase, Vince's one time famous older brother. Turtle, Vincent friend who tags along and starts the parties. And then their is Ari, Vince's unique foul mouthed agent. I started watching a few episodes with him, and I absolutely loved it. The show is not based on jokes or ridiculous physical comedic moments that many comedy shows today feature.  The dialogue is what show has going for it and it is just awesome. And it's like the way you talk to your friends. Its not goofy oscar winning pieces that have went thru multiple rewrites, its the stereotypical way people talk with their friends with the insults and the comebacks. Its the stuff you just love to hear (ex.- I'd say lets hug it out, but I do not want you drawin wood!) From that day, I was hooked on the show,(its a very addictive series) for the rest of the summer, I always waited for the end of the week to see the next episode. Here are the episode list

Episode 9, The boys are Back in Town. The entourage returns from NY after filming Queens Blvd. Eric tries to control the frustration caused by his relationship with Kristen and Ari proposes a new project to Vince- AQUAMAN.

Episode 13, Neighbors. Eric must hide the fact from Vince that he is not officially Aquaman yet while Ari tries to set up a meeting between Vince and Cameron in order to seal the deal. Meanwhile Vince meets his new neighbor Bob Saget.

Episode 15, the Sundance Kids. The boys travel to Sundance film festival for the premier of Queens BLVD. Also awaitng for James Cameron to see the movie and see if he wants Vince as Aquaman. Also Turtle and Drama try to romance the same woman.

Episode 16, Oh Mandy. Vince is now officially Aquaman but now a new problem arises; Mandy Moore is going to aqua girl. Apparently Vince and Mandy share an unpleasant history together-They once dated, it did not end so well and now she is engaged.

Episode 17 I Love You Too. The boys head to a comic convention to promote Aquaman, also Drama is a big star there. Mandy tries to make sure that she and Vince can remain friends, however Eric hints trouble. And if that is not enough an Internet Journalist plans to ruin Vince's career as Aquaman after a bad meeting.

Episode 18, The Bat MitzVah. Vince finally admits to Mandy the he loves and has never stopped loving her. While preparing for his daughter's Bat MitzVah, Ari sense's trouble when his former boss/now partner Terrence, takes an interest in Vince and perhaps steal him from Ari. Also Eric takes an interest in the man's daughter, Sloan.

Episode 20, Good Morning Saigon. After getting back Eric's stolen car, Turtle finds a demo Cd which leads to him meeting Saigon, ad wants to be his manager. A Vince and Mandy's relationship intensifies, Eric must not only deal with Ari but with Mandy's people as well.

Episode 21, Exodus. Turtle, Eric and Drama become suspicious when they spot Mandy with her ex-fiance. Ari's conflict with his partner/boss Terence intensifies when he learns his contract with the company expires in a year. Ari then decides to plan a coup.

Episode 22, The Abyss. After being dumped by Mandy, Vince decides not to do Aquaman which not only upsets Eric but angers him very much. He thinks about quitting as his manager and have Vince fend for himself, convinced Vince screwed up on his own. Meanwhile, Ari tries to get back in the game.

So this really was an exciting season. There also was a serious change in the characters attitudes. At first they were always being big money spenders, but at the end of the season, they were all taking some responsibilities. This was a fun season to watch and I highly recommend buying it on dvd.",1145318400,,5189,4.581445523193096

2548446,5,B000F1IQI2,"Rewatching this series. The first season is pretty good in introducing the characters. After I saw Season 1 for the first time, I thought well I'll give the new season a try. Not a problem because Season 2 is when this show really hits its stride.

I loved the Aquaman movie goal. It's weird because after all the wheeling and dealing, I really wanted to actually see James Cameron's Aquaman and Billy Walsh's Queens Boulevard. Too bad these movies don't really exist.

They also really start developing Ari Gold's character and giving him a storyline that's separate yet parallel to Vince and the boys. The dialogue and banter between the characters is typically cuttingly fast, especially between Ari and Eric.

All the seasons are good from here, but this is the one that really hooks you in. If you've watched Season 1, keep going because this is where it's at.",1466726400,,865,4.753333333333333

Likewise, I would expect there to be only a very few women out there who would enjoy Entourage.  If you're a guy though, it's a feel good story about great friends picking one another up, and ranking on one another the way great friends do every minute of the day.

And with episodes only 30 minutes long, it's definitely pretty easy to get sucked in. HBO never seems to disappoint when it comes to their original TV Series!",1441238400,,263,4.387755102040816

2549002,3,B000F1IQI2,"Watched all eight seasons, and it was a serious period of weakness. Four functional retards, with weekly life changing ups and downs, who are little more than mattress jumpers. You really cannot find a character to latch onto, setting aside Jeremy Piven, who knocks it out of the park, and the only reason for 3 stars, or to watch it beyond the first couple of episodes. Turtle is a goofy soft heart in constant clown attire. Johnny is a whiner with no acting chops or other talents (both the character and the actor Kevin Dillon - I think its genetic). Eric is a man void of confidence, who once he is given a bit of power becomes a power mad irritant - problem is his character actually has good foresight. Rex Lee does a good job, but he is over the top flamboyant, and it becomes a grind.",1441152000,,792,4.358108108108108

They roam through Hollywood and other places like a pack of wolves, alternately using women or being used by them, all the while Chase's career hangs by a thread as super agent Ari Gold wrangles offers for the next big movie. Sometimes the potty humor goes too far, but for the most part, this show will make you laugh and wonder if this is what is might be like to be a movie star or a hanger-on. What makes the show most enjoyable is how things don't always go right, but they do work out. There actually is a lot of tension and pressure to make the right decisions in a world where what is best can hardly be known until after the fact. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. It's a wild one.",1400544000,,823,4.248407643312102

2549281,5,B000F1IQI2,This is a show I thought I would not like but I really enjoyed it. The second season was just as good as the first.

2549299,4,B000F1IQI2,"I happened upon this at the library; yet another tv series I knew next to nothing of (watching almost no tv will do that). But I've always laughed at Piven elsewhere, and HBO is the best at letting writers write, so I gave it a shot; season two was all they had, so I started here.

I didn't know the backstory of season one but it became pretty clear, and the characters grew on me within a few shows, as the writing is hard to not like--- quick and barbed and crisp. I'd heard that Ari Gold is based on Ari Emanuel, real-life Hollywood sleazebag agent (and brother of Obama's top aide...you do the math), so I was amazed to see how much of a weasel they portray him as.

I was immediately reminded of the classic character Peter Dragon, Jay Mohr's similarly nasty agent in the short-lived cult series Action (worth watching for any fans of this show, and clearly its predecessor). Gold and Dragon are cut from the same cloth, where greed and ego are woven into one slick, shiny surface. Piven is perfect, and very funny at moments.

But what grew on me most as the shows went by was Kevin Dillon's sense of humor. Despite flashing back constantly in my mind to his brother Matt's role in Something About Mary, I found myself looking forward to every line from Dillon. The guy becomes this character flawlessly, and his lines are much more subtly humorous than Piven's. Something about him just cracks me up; his lack of guile is at the top of the list. While Piven gets better lines that are sure-fire laughs, Dillon makes even more of his and ends up being the highlight of the show for me.

The best episode is the one written by Larry Charles, of Borat and Seinfeld fame. Now that's some edgy, funny writing. Watch for it in the middle of the season.

I'll check out the first and next seasons, purely for Piven, Dillon, and the solid writing.",1261526400,,1848,4.423529411764706

The show highlights beautiful LA where rich and famous hang out and lived.  Absolutely fascinating!  Season 2 has three disks and the setup is much easier and faster to get to each episode.  It has a special bonus feature where the executive producer Mark Wahlberg interviews the cast and other production members.  Mark allows his star to talk and doesn't steal the show - what a guy!  Great show all around.,1258156800,,586,5.094736842105263
2549303,5,B000F1IQI2,"I have no idea how much women may enjoy ""Entourage"" - I'm also reminded of my brother's description: it's like a he-man woman-hater's club for grown-ups, for those who remember that episode of the old Hal Roach Little Rascals.

Entourage, like other great shows of the past, starts off strong in season one, then in the second season becomes even more fleshed out as the cast and writers become more familiar with their format.

Adrian Grenier's Vinny Chase is coming off filming of the art-house ""Queen's Boulevard"" and is hoping for another meaty project.  He is not particularly interested in donning the glittering suit as Aquaman.  Kevin Connolly's ""E"" continues to grow from former pizza-boy to Hollywood manager - at one point he is recruited by the owner of Ari's agency (played as a magnificent white-haired lion by Malcolm McDowell).  Jerry Ferraro as Turtle gets a little more meat - when he recovers their stolen ride from the police pound he finds a hip-hop demo by Saigon in the CD player.  Instead of turning in Saigon he thinks the music would sound great on the soundtrack of ""Queen's Boulevard"" and offers to be Saigon's manager.  Kevin Dillon is again miraculous as the bundled mess of anxiety and bravado that is Johnny Drama Chase.

Jeremy Piven stands out in an exceptional cast as Vincent's agent Ari - part Andrew Dice Clay, part Tasmanian Devil.  Ari percolates along a hair-trigger away from a volcanic eruption of biblical proportion and you get the idea that he'd sell his own grandmother for a good movie deal.

Celebrity guest roles remain an important part of the mix and you have to give 'em credit - Bob Saget, Gary Busey, Mandy Moore, James Woods, Ralph Macchio and several others play fictional versions of themselves that are hilarious and self-deprecating.  (Saget hangs out at the high-class house of ill repute down the street from the Entourage manse, Macchio is quick to drop into a Karate Kid-like stance when challenged... in other words - the celebrity appearances aren't just cameos - they're actually worked into the story, and they're FUNNY.)",1253577600,2,2089,4.90625
2549304,5,B000F1IQI2,"After watching the second season of ENTOURAGE, I will be getting the rest of the seasons and watching them.  And probably not as fast as I'd like.  Because I have to work and sleep and stuff.

In the second season, the show feels like its coming into better focus, the characters are sharper, the tensions are greater.  And the comedy is funnier.  Ari's new secretary, a gay Asian named Lloyd, is hilarious (""potty mouth,"" he pouts after a screaming call from Ari).  Whether complaining that Ari's slurs are culturally inaccurate (""I'm from China, not Japan,"" Lloyd moans after one demeaning tirade) or playing as Ari's inside man during a ""code red"" at the agency, Lloyd is a great, funny addition to the show.

And Ari Gold is still too much fun to watch.  This is one of those perfect casting moments that strike gold, like James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.

This is not the kind of show that looks like they've just turned some cameras on in Hollywood and improvised more lame movie star stuff.  The stories are very well crafted and the dialogue is spot-on.

ENTOURAGE comes across with an authenticity that makes it infinitely more ""real"" than anything on ""Entertainment Tonight"" and the E! Channel.",1251072000,,1205,4.7729468599033815

The story revolves around a huge new movie that Vince doesn't want, then wants, with a co-star that Vince used to want, now doesn't, then does.  It is all very exciting if you love entourage!

Looks like a Scorcese drama, but it's actually Mark Walhberg's work. Very much worth watching.",1213747200,,411,4.5675675675675675
2549309,5,B000F1IQI2,"The gang is back and this time around Vinny is going to be in the newest hit movie ""Aquaman"" directed by James Cameron. Vinny's co-star for Aquaman will be Mandy Moore. Come to find out, Vinny's heart was crushed by Mandy on the movie `A Walk to Remember'. Yep... our woman hungry movie star Vinny at one time actually had his heart broken. He was in love. Mandy is now happily engaged to someone else and all she wants to be with Vinny is friends. Or does she. Ah, gotta love some good drama. Speaking of drama, Johnny Drama is headed to Comic Con to dress up as his old character from Viking Quest (think of the old TV show Hercules) and sign autographs and make a few bucks. Vince is going to promote his movie so of course Turtle and Eric go also. But here at Comic Con, the tides have changed and Johnny is the big star. He's got hot women all over him and everyone wants to talk to him. Turtle later on finds an up and coming music star and wants to manage him, even though the guy stole Vince's car. E finds new love in Ari Gold's boss's daughter.

Now even though the gang is a good group of guys and actors, I think if someone else would have played their characters (from the beginning of the show), we would still be laughing (maybe not Drama though). I have one exception though and that is Ari Gold who is played by Jeremy Piven. The guy is a genius. Just about all of his lines are a godsend to the show whether they are crude, witty, loving, mad, scared, sarcastic, or genuine, they are all great lines. Most of the time funny as hell lines. His actions are another thing that's great about him because he seems to be a big ball of energy that's about to explode. I've always liked him in just about everything he's been in, but he has really found himself in this show.

One other guy I'd like to mention is the newcomer Lloyd. Ari's new assistant. I didn't think I was going to like him that much, but he has brought a LOT of comedy to this show. Main reason for that is because he's Asian and he's gay. So now Ari has even more ammunition for his onslaught of mean sarcasm. And because Lloyd is a man, Ari is a little harder on him than if he was a woman. But Lloyd is VERY feminine and will cry and get hurt and will just ignore Ari if he wants to which aggravates Ari even more. You can't help but root for Lloyd almost all of the time. Such a great new character.

When it comes to the jokes and glamour, not much has changed, but that's good. The writing is still hilarious and very witty. The show is full of guest cameos which are great if you are a big movie fan like I am. I believe season 2 is better than season 1 and I really liked season 1. This show honestly gets better as it get older.

2549312,5,B000F1IQI2,"The most hilarious thiong about this show is how Vincent gets all the attention in the world while the rest of the Entourage get none of it and yet, they consider themselves important. E as Vin's manager is hilarious in his little act. A little man (not much shorter than me) who has his own set of troubles to take care of, who doesnt have commitment issues but thinks he does - is a great act and despite being the most uncomfortable character manages to somehow intrigue the watcher. Entourage is not a Comedy show, it's not a Drama, it's not reality based tv. It's a guy show with no girls as lead characters. Strange as that may sound, it is still very hip and self content. It's no Seinfeld and there are no observations. The show circles around 4 main characters. Kevin Dillon's character is somehow the Cosmo Kramer of the show and manages to derive most laughs. His awkwardness reminds me of my own. The center character, the Jerry Seinfeld of the show, is Vinnie. I'm sure he doesn't get a lot of credit but the fact that he is always in one mood, is simply superb. That, from what I understand, is a great act. Where do I start about turtle? The George Costanza of the show who couldn't care less. Initially, I thought I'd hate his character cause I hate guys like him. You and I both know how many Turtles we run into everyday life so I didn't know what to expect when I saw him on tv. A lot of reviewers admit to loving turtle. I'm sure they're six feet tall studs who love to hug shorter, rounder men...oops let me not drift away. Entourage owns. There is nothing like Entourage. I must say in the last two years, Television is back. Jeremy Piven is about as good as you hear he is. I love his assistant.

Q. Why should you buy season 2?
A. Season 2 would explain the storyline in a superb way. This is the season that made the show. Definitely. It also has a lot of heart and emotions considering Mandy and Vince hit it on and off. Besides all that poker, it's just a must have, really.",1185235200,,2001,4.2936507936507935

2549318,4,B000F1IQI2,"ENTOURAGE: SEASON 2 begins three months after the first season ended.  When we last left Vince and his gang, they were flying back home to New York for Vince's starring role in the hot indie film, QUEEN'S BOULEVARD.  Season 2 begins with the gang flying back to L.A. after the shoot in New York has ended.  Eric is now officially Vince's manager and all major money decisions have to be run by him.  QUEENS BOULEVARD is already generating positive buzz and things look good for Vince.  Remembering their agreement to do a studio picture before leaving for New York, Ari has been busy behind the scenes trying to get Vince a role in the next big budget superhero picture:  Aquaman.  Unlike many superhero pictures, rumor has it that the film has a great script and might be the career making movie for the right actor.  The majority of Season 2 revolves around the pursuit of Vince for the Aquaman project.  Major subplots include the gang being kicked out of the mansion and Vince buying his own, Vince re-establishing his relationship with Mandy Moore, Turtle becoming the manager for rapper Saigon, Drama obsessing about getting calf implants, and Eric learning how to balance his roll as both Vince's manager and best friend.  There are a huge amount of celebrities that make appearances in various episodes including among others James Cameron, Hugh Hefner, Ludacris, Ralph Macchio, Jaime Pressly, Bob Saget, Brooke Shields, Gary Busey, and Pauly Shore.

My favorite episodes from the Season are:

""Episode 10: The Bat Mitzvah""--the gang attends Ari's daughter's Bat Mitzvah.

""Episode 13: Exodus""--Ari's career reaches a crisis.

""Episode 14: The Abyss""--Vince is emotionally devastated and threatens to walk away from the biggest movie of his life.

I enjoyed ENTOURAGE SEASON 2 a little better than Season 1.  The second season dives a little deeper into the main characters of the cast.  I really liked how the shows tried to illustrate that even though Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) appears to be an A-level jerk, he actually is a good guy and cares for Vince.  The one drawback is that I would have liked to have seen more of Shauna (Debi Mazar), Vince's publicist.  Shauna is a very interesting character and I would have liked to seen a story or two focus on her a bit more.

Viewers shouldn't get the wrong idea, though.  Even though SEASON 2 explores the relationships and lives of the main characters more, ENTOURAGE basically is still a man's soap opera about living the good life.  Also, like the first season, SEASON 2 is seriously lacking in extras.  The first season at least had a few commentaries.  SEASON 2 has none.  The only extra is a bonus feature entitled ""The Mark Wahlberg Sessions"" which is basically Mark chatting with the cast and crew.  I don't blame Wahlberg because he apparently wanted this extra to be a great behind the scenes look.  However, the cast and crew apparently weren't very cooperative.  Jeremy Piven is rather friendly and Jerry Ferrara tells an interesting story about Gary Busey tickling Kevin Connolly in an attempt to get him to urinate, but other than that most of the conversations are dull and are rehashes of stuff from the extras of the first season.

I liked ENTOURAGE: SEASON 2.  However, it's not for everyone.  I'd recommend it only for fans of the show or for people who have a serious interest in the filmmaking business.",1176163200,,3381,4.827826086956522

2549325,4,B000F1IQI2,"Back when this season was originally airing the New York Times made the point that this show is so good that it nearly renders ""Sex and the City"" obsolete. It seemed to me to be an extreme stance, but just maybe they have a point. ""Entourage"" is the obvious successor to ""Sex and the City,"" four people of the same gender living free and trying to get lucky with the opposite sex. But is it so much better? I would say that character wise the two shows are equal; ""Entourage"" holds the edge in dialogue, which is sharper, plus there is the added bonus of no shoes and no sappiness. So yes, ""Entourage"" win, and it is so good in fact that it is currently the best show on TV. Season 2 will likely to remembered for the Vince Chase (Adrian Grenier)/Mandy Moore (herself) romance. Vince, famous for his ability to not give a crap, really does give a crap when Mandy Moore reenters his life as they are going to film James Cameron's ""Aquaman"" together. So Moore, with her seductive hold over Vince, works as a sort of Kryptonite for Aquaman. He stops showing up for meeting and begins proclaiming that the only thing he cares about is her. The show moves towards a finale in which the group has to resist the urge to split apart. Vince's posse, in it supposedly out of loyalty, has that loyalty tested when the money threatens to disappear thanks to Vince's love life. The ride you go on with this characters has a velocity that is off the charts. The wit found here is breathtaking. Everything is done with such energy (even mundane business meetings) that you can't help but watch. The show does everything right, and it looks as though they aren't even trying.

I would be beyond remiss if I didn't say a few words about the inspired performance of Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold, Vince's agent. It has no boundaries, no lack of enthusiasm, and has a knack for becoming unhinged. It is the kind of performance that Al Pacino built his career around. It is over the top, but endlessly entertaining and exciting. He gets some wicked lines to work with and nails them all. Without him the show would lose more than a step. The show is also about the love of movies. The more you know about the history of cinema the more of the inside jokes you will get. Some are easier to get than others, such as Bob Sagat showing up to play against his ""Full House"" type and swear at the boys while warning them away from his daughters. Sagat's rebirth is a source of much enjoyment for me. ""Entourage"" is a near perfect show. It matches ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" cringe inducing moment for cringe inducing moment. Their continuity is solid and creative, seen this season when they bring back Emily, this time as an agent for James Cameron. Even when they sell out and devote an entire episode to one product (""Fight Night Round 2"") you don't have time to be outraged because you are having too much fun. Every season the boys grow up a little bit more. The lesson they learn here is that their carefree ways are subsidized by Vince actually caring once in a while. An ""Aquaman"" paycheck will allow you to have your integrity, as long as you sacrifice it for the duration of filming. Money is still the name of the game even though they have more than any reasonable person could ever spend. I could have done without the constant swooning over material wealth, but at least they don't have a serious shoe addiction.",1166832000,6,3390,4.476575121163166

2549329,5,B000F1IQI2,"What a great show! Really, I found myself howling with laughter, espcially with some of the dialog that Ari spews. His profanity, masagonistic, racist off color remarks are captivating. As is his adrenaline stoked performance.  He is one of my favorite characters, you love to hate him, then he shows his sensitive caring side and draws you in.  Entourage is really a captivating look at the free ride most folks in the business of LA have...and how unworldly it all is.  Vice's brother, and buddies leech of him, but also provide him the buffer he needs from the real world.  It is amazing how they bumble into more money, pussie, and pot without ever really having to break a sweat.  It isn't fair! But that is Hollywood.  Crisp fast paced writing and shooting make this a must see comedy for anyone who loves the ""inside"" scoop on Hollywood. I can't wait for the third season.",1162425600,,879,4.638709677419355
2549330,4,B000F1IQI2,"Let me start off by saying that Entourage is currently my favorite show to watch. You don't have to live in Hollywood or be in the business to appreciate the rapid-fire banter and acid-tongued humour of mostly soulless, bottom-line crazy, image obsessed actors and the agents, publicists, managers and hangers-on who indulge them.

As a huge fan of Sex and the City, I immediately got hooked on this show not just for its intelligent blend/balance of humour and pathos (none of whom do it better than Jeremy Piven and the extremely underrated Kevin Dillon) but much like Sex and the City, it is a show about a fantasy world for 4 people who go through so much, get screwed by so many but will always have each other. The family bond between Vince, E, Drama and Turtle (I love that we don't know his real name) is what drives the show and keeps it grounded no matter how crazy things get. No one anticipated the show's return for Season 3 more than I and it didn't disappoint.

The DVD, however, did. The great thing about Entourage is that it is such a ""behind-the-scenes"" show. Not only giving you a behind the scenes look at Hollywood and the business that is Hollywood but also because the writers are so great at creating backstories to just about every character without actually telling you what they are. I was so hoping that the DVD for Season 2 would reveal how they managed to get this actor to guest star or what funny/crazy/scary story happened when they shot on such and such location but instead we got nothing. No audio commentaries, no deleted scenes or alternate endings. No footage of Johnny Drama's previous guest spots (I mean, come on, who isn't dying to see him playing the bulimic pedophile on the Commish). There are so many episodes of Season 2 that I would have loved to have known more about but all we get are the Mark Wahlberg sessions, which a) I had already seen on HBO On Demand and b) weren't that interesting because we don't really learn more about the show and c) Mark Wahlberg comes off as a bit of a douchebag.

I would have loved audio commentary on Chinatown, if not for the last 2 minutes alone and because I love Asian cinema. How could they not have Chris Henchy, one of the writers of the show, comment on Blueballs Lagoon which guest starred his real life wife, Brooke Shields?! James Cameron, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, does a recurring guest spot and no one has anything to say about it? Mandy Moore plays a huge role and we are left wondering why they decided to give Vince a real relationship, why Mandy Moore (I felt it was a bit of an odd choice) and why did she refuse to come back in the 3rd season and they basically act like she never existed. You would think a writing staff of men would have something to say about shooting at the Playboy Mansion (Aquamansion, great episode, with great scenes by Ralph Macchio and Pauly Shore) or at Sundance or at a real Lakers game.

I was really let down with the lack of extras in the DVD, especially with the lack of audio commentary. Hopefully, they will beef it up for Season 3.

Not to deter anyone from watching the show, this is one of the best written shows on television. If you loved Sex and the City and you are not watching this show then you are truly missing out. Networks have tried to emulate the magic that was SATC (cough, Heather Graham, cough) but none have come close. That is because SATC already has an heir to the throne and Entourage is it. People are just fooled because the show is about 4 men instead of 4 women and is in LA, not New York. And if you have not discovered the wonder that is Kevin Dillon...I mean, I never even knew that Matt Dillon had a brother until this show! Kevin Dillon's Johnny Drama is probably one of the funniest, smartest and most complex characters written on television to date. He is absurd, self-centered, pathetic, self-conscious, puerile, weathered, smart, stupid and still a very real human being. Dillon manages to take the most ridiculous character and fill him with so many nuances that Drama can go from one extreme to the next in a matter of seconds (and he often does) and you still totally buy it. I could watch Dillon act for hours, he's that good and while I love Jeremey Piven, I have to say if anyone should be nominated for and win an Emmy, it should be Dillon.

I'm giving the Season 2 DVD 4 out of 5 stars. Season 2 gets 5 out of 5 but the DVD gets 3 out of 5 because of lack of extras.",1161388800,3,4472,4.401451027811366
2549331,5,B000F1IQI2,"This is such a great show. I have to watch every episode

  Highly recommended.",1155600000,,143,4.111111111111111
2549332,4,B000F1IQI2,"The Helpful Part:  Season Two continues where the first left off, following Vince Chase, a young actor on the cusp of greatness, as he and his friends try to survive in Hollywood.  This season includes Vincent getting a lead in a James Cameron movie and getting tangled up with an old love interest (Mandy Moore).  Meanwhile, Ari gets in a battle with his boss over who should represent Vince, Eric gets a new love interest, and Turtle discovers and represents a rapper.

The Review:  I watched the first season of Entourage and I enjoyed it, but I wasn't exactly hooked.  When the second season came along I wasn't that eager to watch until I saw a marathon one day and ended up watching 3 episodes in a row.

You can criticize a lot about the show--it appeals mostly to males, the acting is poor (except Jeremy Piven), and there is very little in the way of plot and conflict.  But, in the end, it's still pretty entertaining and one of the better shows on TV.  You get a nice glimpse of how catty Hollywood can be.  Some of the characters aren't fully developed (Turtle), but three of them are exceptional:  Ari, the agent; Vincent, shallow prima donna; and Johnny Drama, the washed up older brother.

What really pushes this show over the top are the cameos.  On some shows that comes off like a gimmick for ratings, but that never seems to happen here.  Mandy Moore and James Cameron do an excellent job of playing themselves.  There are quick appearances by Jaime Pressly, Lamar Odom, Chris Penn, Amanda Peet, Garey Busey, Vanessa Angel, Brooke Shields, and many others.  Then there is the episode with Bob Saget playing the hard partying neighbor--probably the best episode so far and one of the funniest cameos in TV history.",1154995200,3,1733,4.632786885245902
2549333,5,B000F1IQI2,"At first I expected Entourage to be a macho treatise all about Marky Mark, the stud; however, by the Second Season, it is proven to be much more that that, without including some really brilliant cameos from celebrities who do not feel gimmicky but, rather, increase credibility.  The writing and acting is what makes this show great.  Thus, this show must be about the producer's (Mark Wahlberg) vision, who definitely knows his stuff, and not Marky Mark, the super stud.

Granted, these characters are masculine in a modern sense, but WHO expects every man to be poetically sensitive???  I'm glad that macho and effeminate have found a relative meeting ground (for awhile at least).

I'm still not all that keen on ""the birth of a star,"" general plot, but depiction of forces necessary to merely survive in the entertainment business keeps this show interesting.  We've all heard about the value of support groups either at home, the workplace, or in therapy.  The rising star's friends, family, and employees are a colorful bunch.  Each of the ""boys"" brings something valuable to the group, and are essential to its functioning.  Apparently, members of the ""industry"" swear by the show's authenticity, and look to it for inspiration.

I am an aesthete, so I confess that my favorite parts consist of the art direction: the settings, props, and clothes.  Next, is the way the men and women interact; then, the rap-oriented, pop-oriented soundtrack.  All these lend to authenticity and credibility for this L.A. Story.  And, last but not least, is the brutal reality of show business.  It's like ""Get rich or die trying.""  This stuff is inspiring.

This show should last at least five seasons.  It may take that long just to tell the basic story of these guys, and making it in a creative, competitive industry.",1154736000,2,1812,4.927392739273928

2549337,5,B000F1IQI2,"As I said in my review for Entourage's first season, while it was a good run of episodes, it's probably a good thing that I knew that they would improve, or I may not have stuck with the show.  Season 2 improves on every aspect of the show; the characters become more developed, the writing improves, and the jokes seem to get funnier.
The year begins 3 months after the end of season 1; the boys have just returned from New York, where Vince (Adrian Grenier) was shooting an independent film.  While he didn't get a large paycheck for it, it was a dream project for him, and it seemed that the role was tailored for Vince.  Immediately, Vince's agent Ari (Jeremy Piven) is hounding Vince about his next project.  Vince and his manager/best friend Eric ""E"" Murphy (Kevin Connolly) want to get a film called Medellin, which is the story of Pablo Escabar, but Ari insists that they do a film version of Aquaman.  Vince and Eric object to Aquaman, seeing it as a waste of time, seeing as how he will be doing a lot of blue-screen work, about a lame superhero.  Medellin, they argue, is the best of both worlds; it is another pet project for Vince, but it is a studio picture that will earn Vince a large paycheck.  However, Vince soon learns that he does not yet have the clout to get Medellin, and if he does Aquaman (and does a good job), Ari can nearly guarantee him Medellin.  Aquaman is embraced fully by Vince when he learns that James Cameron is attached to direct, but the moment that happens, the offer for Vince is withdrawn.
The Aquaman story is the main plot for the year, and it broken into different parts (the initial offer, getting the offer back, and then dealing with pre-production).  However, numerous sub-plots develop that involve the rest of the entourage.  Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon), Vince's washed-up brother finally succeeds in getting a job, and his dream comes true when Brooke Shields is revealed to be his costar.  Meanwhile, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) begins to show that he is good for something besides just mooching off Vince when he decides to manage an up-and-coming rapper.  Eric, meanwhile, must deal with the stress of being Vince's manager; whether dealing with Ari, with whom he shares a mutual hatred, or Vince's publicist Shauna (Debi Mazar), he always seems to get his head torn off.  Though they are nothing compared to people outside Vince's employment, such as a Harvey Weinstein stand-in (it's likely that Weinstein didn't want to play himself in a role that mocked him) that nearly killed him and Ari over a dispute involving Vince.  Finally, Ari had a story involving his partner, Terrence McQuiwick (Malcolm McDowell).  Fearing that Terrence wants to usurp Vince from him, Ari does everything he can, including embarrassing his daughter at her own bat mitzvah to foil Terrence's plans.
The humor this season seemed to be ten times better than the jokes in the first season.  Drama remains my favorite character; whether stating his bizarre theories about why good bagels are only available on one square block of LA to making a fool out of himself at Comic Con to his scene with his celebrity crush Brooke Shields, Drama always succeeds at making me laugh.  Ari is a close second favorite for me, and his verbal sparring with Eric remains great.  Ari's ability to thoroughly humiliate Eric and then wonder why Eric would even think of insulting him is great, and his ruthlessness is made even better by the way he is so completely afraid of his wife.  Turtle is sitll my least favorite character, but I found that I don't dislike him anymore.  Also, this year the celebrity cameos actually had a purpose (for the most part).  Shields, Cameron, Mandy Moore, Pauly Shore, and Ralph Macchio all contributed to the plot.  There were a few cameos that were there for the sake of a cameo, but the one I found truly amazing was Bob Saget.  He didn't have much to contribute nor did he do anything extremely funny, but the fact that he appeared as himself in a role that so thoroughly mocked him surprises me.
As I said, every main character had a chance to grow this year, and Vince finally stopped being a one-dimensional protagonist.  He still is the least developed (but as other reviewers have said, that may be intentional), but at least he showed that he has a mood besides just ""yeah, whatever"".
There were also numerous characters introduced this year who added to the fun.  Terrence was a great villain and foil for Ari; here was a man who was just as ruthless as Ari, but he is able to offer things to Vince that Ari can't, which is saying a lot.  He is richer and better connected than Ari, who, up until Terrence was introduced, had the best connections on the show.  Terrence's daughter Sloan (Emmanuelle Chriqui) is one of the first girls on the show to ward off Vince in favor of Eric, and the pair's relationship causes happiness for them and worry for Ari (he fears that Eric may be sleeping with the enemy).  Best of all, this year introduces Lloyd (Rex Lee), Ari's new assistant.  While Emily was better to look at, Lloyd is hilarious.  A ""gaysian"" as Ari calls him, Lloyd's mannerisms are great, and his relationship with Ari is priceless, especially in the last two episodes.  It seems like Lloyd is the only person besides Mrs. Ari who can stand up to Ari and tell him how he feels about the way Ari treats him (though, unlike Mrs. Ari, Ari does not fear Lloyd).
The season ended with a huge twist (by Entourage's standards), and leaves the audience wanting more.  It's amazing how great a show about the extravagent lifestyle of a Hollywood star can be, but if you don't believe me, see for yourself.  Entourage is a surprisingly good show that tells us that the life in Hollywood isn't all fun and games.",1153094400,2,5775,4.635917566241413

Or maybe the writing has improved just a smidgen, and that's all it took for this show to deliver on its potential? Anyway, the storylines now click, the banter and comedy flow naturally (none of the ""trying too hard"" syndrome I noticed first time out), and the actors are delivering the goods. Much has been made of Jeremy Piven nailing his role of Ari, but the supporting cast (especially the  guy who plays Lloyd, Ari's secretary) are really hitting their marks too.",1152316800,2,777,4.705882352941177

There is some great cameo appearances and guest stars in this season.  There's James Cameron, Lamar Odom, Brooke Shields, U2 (the guys went to an actual concert of theirs and Bono gave a shout out to Drama), Anthony Anderson, Amanda Peet, Melinda Clarke, Bob Saget, Mandy Moore etc etc.
The main focus of this season has been to get Vincent into a movie called Aquaman.  I love watching Ari in action trying to make things happen.  I loved when he fired the mail guy by mistake and how whipped he is by his wife.
