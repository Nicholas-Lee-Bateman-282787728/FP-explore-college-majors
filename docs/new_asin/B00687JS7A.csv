4977476,5,B00687JS7A,Good show and brought together great comedienes.  Very well done and nostalgic for me.  Quality of video  excellent.  If saw original as child will enjoy.,1384646400,,154,5.04
4977477,3,B00687JS7A,So funny to look at what humor used to be. As opposed to todays comedians. Smart and witty jokes. Fun.,1379030400,,102,4.15
4977478,4,B00687JS7A,I enjoyed this very much back then the performers looked as though they were just having fun and it happened to be in front of an audience.,1373500800,2,139,4.185185185185185
4977479,3,B00687JS7A,"This variety show, broadcast in November of 1959, was the final ""entertainment"" appearance of Eddie Cantor.  (He narrated a television show a few months later and continued to do pre-recorded radio for the next few years, though the shows were recorded at his home). Cantor appears with old pals Burns, Benny and the omni-present Jessel.  Mr. Cantor was deep in the agony of grief at this point, having lost his eldest daughter to cancer just a few months earlier.  His own health was deteriorating rapidly, evidenced by his gaunt appearance and slow speech.  Nonetheless, Eddie summoned the energy for a brief reprisal of a bit he had done with Jessel in vaudeville thirty years earlier and held his own nicely in an extended dressing room sketch with all four gents late in the show.",1327276800,3,785,4.835820895522388
4977480,2,B00687JS7A,I'm a fan of both George Burns and Eddie Cantor. Unfortunately the picture quality of this recording is terrible and I was unable to watch it. (I suppose I could have listened to it and pretended it was radio but for that I have....a radio.) I was enjoying the show and all but the blurry faces and lousy quality drove me away. If that doesn't bother you and you enjoy these old time comedians you still may like it.,1438128000,,416,4.2784810126582276
4977481,5,B00687JS7A,such fun to watch,1436745600,,17,3.5

4977484,5,B00687JS7A,Great collection of the really wonderfully funny comedians of the time.  Brings back fond memories.,1425945600,,99,5.6

4977486,3,B00687JS7A,"George Burns is a very funny man!
He is a natural for the stage!
I think anyone would love this comedy!",1402790400,,103,3.9523809523809526
4977487,4,B00687JS7A,"I like George Burns, although I miss seeing his wife Gracie in the show, the two together make such a wonderful show, but this one is entertaining and had very good singers and comedians",1399420800,,186,4.5
4977488,3,B00687JS7A,"Anyone who grew up watching George and Gracie on black & white TV in the 1950s will enjoy this nostalgic trip back in time. The humor is gentle and unthreatening, the plots are sweet, and George's sardonic attitude is very funny. An enjoyable escape.",1398470400,,250,4.704545454545454
4977489,5,B00687JS7A,"great comedy very well written. Nothing like that today.  Gracie burns was extremely talented, especially the way she could give the straight lines",1395705600,,147,5.391304347826087
8494656,5,B00687JS7A,"The picture quality of the Synergy release which I streamed via Amazon Prime is not very good.  Fortunately this episode of Ford Television Theatre, revving vaudeville for tv in 1959, is very good despite the picture quality.  It was fun watching old friends George Burns, Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor and George Jessel getting together for old vaudeville acts.",1477440000,,357,5.137931034482759
8494657,5,B00687JS7A,They don't make 'em like this anymore.  In real life Jack and George were best friends and lived about 3 blocks from each other.  Was also fun seeing a very young Bobby Darin.  Loved watching all of it.,1472774400,,202,4.2631578947368425
8494658,2,B00687JS7A,"George Burns, Edie Cantor, Georgie Jessel were quite disappointing as comedians--and Burns as a singer as well. The one bright note: Jack Benny, especially in the ""hands"" routine. Bobby Daren at 23 was prematurely old. Only the Kingston Trio performed as I remembered them.",1471824000,,273,5.2272727272727275

8494661,3,B00687JS7A,I never knew George was ever a young guy :).  The Kingston Trio was pretty sweet too.  good show.,1466985600,,97,4.052631578947368

8494664,3,B00687JS7A,"I am amazed at the talent that George and others on the show exhibited.  They didn't have all the video and audio capabilities that we have today.  It's really great to see ""unenhanced"", raw talent being displayed by dance and vocal performers.  I mean, come on!  When have you last seen someone spread salt on the floor so you could hear them slide their feet to the music.  It was probably all done with a real live orchestra, too!",1459209600,,433,4.430379746835443
8494665,5,B00687JS7A,What can you say about George Burns? His dry humor was always wonderful and loved his guest stars on this program! Another vintage winner! Keep em coming!,1442102400,2,154,4.7407407407407405
