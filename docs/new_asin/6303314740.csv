7842997,5,6303314740,"This is a computer animation with new-age music.  I'm normally not a fan of new age music, but for some reason I found this video very mesmerizing and almost hypnotic.  Then animation is very colorful and interesting to look at, and is synchronized with the music.  This is not currently available on DVD, which is a shame.",1456876800,,323,4.631578947368421
7842998,4,6303314740,"It's a 50-minute long piece of visual abstract art, with Serrie's music to accompany it. The graphics for this video are pretty to regard, was pretty cutting edge for its day, but it's the kind of thing that could be rendered in real time by even the most lowly of modern computers. It makes a fine background animation, gives people something non-repetitive to look at while they aren't otherwise engaged. If it was available on DVD, I'd scoop it up.",1368835200,,451,4.65
7842999,5,6303314740,"Oh, my WORD!!!  I loooooooooooooooooove this album... it is soooooo beautiful and soothing and relaxing and wonderful.  Some of the selections are dreamy and calming, and there are also a few really upbeat and energizing pieces on it, too.  And I'm a ""tough customer"" who is difficult to satisfy, so if I say that this recording is really nice, you can count on it that it is OUTSTANDING!  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",1179705600,,417,4.830985915492958
7843000,5,6303314740,"I can't recommend this relaxation video enough! The fractals are varied, quite colorful and interesting to watch. The New Age music is done by various artists containing many well know tunes! While I was a bit confused by the previous reviews, let make it clear: this is an outstanding relaxation tape! One I hope will be distributed wide and far!",1110931200,,347,4.8
