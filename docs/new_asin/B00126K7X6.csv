8244261,5,B00126K7X6,"I bought Burn to Sing DVD and Sing-Aerobics Workout CD by Elisabeth Howard and Howard Austin from Amazon. It was shipped to me very fast and well protected.
As I learnt before, it was said if one has to sing, there are certain things he needs to eat or avoid in order to have nice singing voice. With born to sing I found that eating rules do not matter well if one knows how to control his voice any how he wants.
With my small experience on receiving voice training using Burn to Sing DVD and Sing-Aerobics Workout CD,they are very good voice training tools that give you every opportunity to train your voice at home to an expert level of singing. Born to Sing made me to know that no matter my type of voice and style of singing, my voice can be trained to achieve my goal. I see it not just for me at the beginner's level but it is very good for the professionals too, as I compare many professional singers voices to these Born to Sing voice training DVD and Aerobics Workout CD.
Burn to Sing DVD and Sing-Aerobics Workout CD by Elisabeth Howard and Howard Austin are good home voice training tools for every singer(s), individual or group, even for music teachers.",1351814400,,1171,4.376146788990826
8244262,5,B00126K7X6,"I have purchased SEVERAL of Elizabeth Howard's and Howard Austin's vocal singing products. They are absolutely the BEST products for anyone serious about developing his/her vocal instrument. They focus on breath support, vibrato, technique, strength and so much more! These awesome singing products have enabled me to sing publically (in churches,specifically) with the confidence that I never had prior to using them. They have also worked to not only develop my singing and speaking voice but to strengthen it as well. I don't know much about Howard but I do know that Elizabeth was trained at the fantastic Julliard School (I think this school focuses on vocal development). This lady can SING! She sings so beautifully in many different genres such as ballads, country, and rock. I've had a few vocal teachers but Elizabeth Howard and Howard Austin are by far the absolute best vocal teachers I've had the delight to experience and grow by. Anyone unsure about purchasing a product from them  needn't be...I'm a Christian and I would absolutely not say this if I did not fully believe it. To all who are searching for an answer, take care and may God guide you in this decision.",1316908800,,1182,4.939698492462312
