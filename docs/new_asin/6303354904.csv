628187,3,6303354904,This movie is alright. Not nearly as good as the first one. But like I always say I'm a movie collector. So its a must to complete Ure collection.,1334361600,,146,4.068965517241379
628188,4,6303354904,This sequel was a lot different then the original. Not as good as the first but still recommend.,1286582400,3,96,4.388888888888889
628189,5,6303354904,"The first time I watched this I immediately fell in love with it.
It's crazy, funny, random and adventurous.
May not be better than the first but it DOES break from the story.
The characters even talk about it during the beginning.

And how can you not love Feldman and Haim playing Bobby and Dinger!
Even though ""Bobby""(Feldman) is more mature in this one he is still funny.
As for ""Dinger""(Haim)...he didn't change much at all.
Still cute and hilarious.
If you have a Corey's Collection this is defiantly must have.",1275004800,2,517,4.681318681318682
628190,3,6303354904,This movie isn't nearly as good as the first one but its not horrible. The main reason I bought this movie is becouse I liked the first one so much. Im also a fan of the two Coreys. Love them but not this movie. Its just an OK type movie. I would not recommend buying this movie unless your like me a fan of the two Coreys.,1268870400,,323,3.8358208955223883
628191,1,6303354904,"I went through a period of fandom for Feldman and Haim and watched every movie of theirs I could get my hands on.  Even then, in the height of my adoration of the two, it was hard to enjoy this, and now it's just downright horrendous.

It's probably a good movie to drink excessively to.  Maybe you could take a shot every time you hear another bad Corey Feldman song on the soundtrack, or every time their lips aren't in sync with the audio track.  OR, every time Feldman has another Michael Jackson-esque wardrobe change!

The acting is sub-par even for the Corey's.  The budget is low even for a B movie.  The ""unbelievably hot babe that all the guys want"" wasn't even mildly attractive.  She had acne scars and untamed hair and wore a ridiculous shade of all purple that wasn't even appealing back in the 90's.  The dialog is utterly ludicrous, and I've a feeling that Feldman might have had a hand in writing it, considering how largely his name is plastered on the cover and the music and how cool it attempts (and fails) to make him look.

Dream a Little Dream was an enjoyable, if bad, classic 80's flick.  Both the boys were decent in it even if the plot was sort of insubstantial.  Dream a Little Dream 2 is a sad attempt to reconnect on past glory.

I bought it for $5.  It's fun to laugh at.  :-)",1208736000,19,1308,4.325102880658436
628192,1,6303354904,"I had seen parts of this movie many years ago and I wanted to not only own it on DVD, (because I have ""Dream A Little Dream"" 1, but I wanted to watch this movie all the way though, plus complete the 2 movie set of ""Dream A Little Dream."")  I have to say that the movie is VERY disappointing and is even hokey, (more hokier than the first movie with the same name with the 2 Coreys in it was a few years prior to this movie being released.)  I am also not really happy with Corey Feldman as an actor in this movie any way, because he isn't that good of an actor even outside of this movie and Corey Feldman was a jerk in the A & E show called the ""2 Coreys.""",1191110400,6,657,3.823529411764706
628193,2,6303354904,"Dream a Little Dream was one of my favorite movies from the 80's.  It had the Corey's with their great style and chemistry together, it had vintage actors like Jason Robards and Piper Laurie and it had Meredith Salenger (whom I could watch read the phone book for 2 hours and not complain).  When I found out there was a SEQUEL I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  But, as sequels often are, Dream a Little Dream 2 is a cheap imitation.  The story line is a far stretch at best from the original.  Magic glasses that allow the wearer to control another persons actions, come on.  Robyn Lively takes over as Feldman's love interest (not bad, but she's no Meredith).  Stacie Randall takes a turn as both the Coreys' dream girl and makes for pretty good eye candy, but not very convincing as the villan.  Robards and Laurie are gone which loses alot of the class of the original.  Also, at this point in their careers the Corey's don't have their same flair together as it seems they were starting to outgrow each other and venture out on their own.  Not a horrible movie, but not a worthy sequel to an 80's pop classic.",972864000,44,1124,4.360576923076923
628194,1,6303354904,"This movie is a disastar compared to the first one, wich is one of my all time favorite movies.  I can't believe the same stars (Haim, Feldmen) returned to make such a bad follow up to a great story.",952819200,9,199,4.102564102564102
