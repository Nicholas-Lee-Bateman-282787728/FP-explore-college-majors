This beautiful African American Princess's story takes place in the vibrant city of New Orleans...the settings covered everything from the bayou to the French Quarter...it showcased the music, the art, and the delicious food of the crescent city....the bright colors and choreography durings the songs, were spectacular!!.....this movie showed that no matter the class or race, hard work is worth it, that family is important, and that love can prevail.",1530835200,,543,5.112359550561798
