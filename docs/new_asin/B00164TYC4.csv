8260832,5,B00164TYC4,"I first saw this on Amazon Prime. I didn't know what to expect except maybe a bad B-movie. I was wrong. Troy Mink is a one man show doing 13 different characters on stage. The story revolves around the town of Midway TN and the murder/suicide of a local named Mary.  This ""movie"" is so creative and unique. Troy has southerners down, I'm from GA. and could picture people I know in every one of his characters.  The film is very humorous with a good deal of tragedy tossed in. Troy is very talented and after seeing it on Prime (several times) I went looking to see if it was on dvd because if and when Amazon pulls it from their lineup I wanted to be able to watch it again and again.  He brings all the characters to life and moves seamlessly from one to another. My husband and my favorite character is Stewart.  There is no expensive scenery, no special effects, nothing high tech. It's just a man and the stage and it is great.  I wish he would make more stage plays with these characters. He does an amazing job and I am glad to be able to own it.  I would say it would be close to a PG-13 mainly for one characters use of obscenities but other than that it is very clean.",1503014400,,1178,4.144736842105263
