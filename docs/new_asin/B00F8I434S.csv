8613049,5,B00F8I434S,"Visually, this Cosi is gorgeous: the colors, the feel of space, the play with time. Musically and dramatically, it ranges from very good to excellent. A perceptively done Mozart makes you realize that the music conveys more than you, or the previous productions, have quite dared to explore. This version generated such moments for me. An alternative sub-title for Cosi could be `All you ever wanted to know about love but were afraid to learn'. The duo of Despina and Don Alfonso is done brilliantly: I see and hear things that I have not grasped before. The four protagonists are well sung and in some cases also superbly acted. The name Michael Haneke is not a particular draw for me: I was indeed braced for an over-designed production. Unnecessarily so. Haneke has really listened to the music and knows when to get out of the way.

There is no such thing as the best Cosi in my view, as every production demands choices from the directors. The question of who feels what for whom, when, and why requires an answer if one is to stage the opera, but no answer can entirely match the music. This Cosi is among the most intelligent available today and it may be a good place from which to start your journey. Once you set off, there is no turning back.",1403654400,14,1254,4.548672566371682
8613050,5,B00F8I434S,"Cosi Fan Tutte is one of my favorite operas.  The best Mozart music; Di Ponte's best liberetto; and this the best production---ever.  This production brings a new and disturbing look and interpretation.  Three couples instead of two--Despina here is in love with the protagonist; usually they merely pass in the action.
This production is about the ambiguity of love: the passing passion; the lusts & losses; the enduring working together to make a life and children.
Modern dress or ancient costumes mix to create an atmosphere of uncertainty as is the commitment of the lovers to each other.  And the ending leaves you wondering who couples with whom?
No cloying, standard opera conventions here.  Rather a modern, cinematic touch of idealistic, sublimated illusion.  Such beautiful women and good-looking men all acting with skill and precision.  And singing to the high ceilings.
Get this DVD.  If you watch no other Cosi, watch this one.  It is the best ever.",1399075200,13,964,5.050632911392405
8613051,5,B00F8I434S,"In many ways, this is Mozart's most modern opera. For many years I taught a gen ed course in opera, and, when it came to Mozart, this is the opera we dealt with in depth because it was very easy for undergrads to relate to its complexities. Michael Haneke has laid bare the bleak realities underlying the blithe and totally wrong-headed obsessions of the youngsters and the bleak prospects of the cynical and jaded Don Alfonso and Despina. When the curtain comes down on the finale of Cos, we are left with so many questions, all begging for answers and resolutions.",1396483200,7,566,4.6138613861386135
8613052,5,B00F8I434S,"Michael Haneke is a very special director: Cool, intellectual, intense. This Cosi is cool, but also heartwarming. Great singers in wonderful performance in Madrid. Great stuff.",1392336000,5,176,5.8076923076923075
8613053,4,B00F8I434S,"Despite coming up with a brilliant and brutal depiction of Don Giovanni for the Paris Opera a few years ago, it's hard to imagine what the Austrian film director Michael Haneke could find of interest in what is perhaps the least substantial of Mozart's mature operas, or at least the lesser of the composer's collaborations with librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte.  A light amusement at the School for Lovers by the director of Cach&egrave;/Hidden?  It doesn't take too long however to recognise a distinctive twist on the discord between the two couples in the work.  Two couples?  There would appear to be three couples in Haneke's version, the other one being made up of Don Alfonso and Despina.  This unconventional couple don't so much dispense a lesson in love here as exhibit a cruel streak towards the gender politics in the work and attacks middle-class complacency.  Some 'Funny Games' here perhaps?

Or perhaps 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses'?  Haneke sets the production in what looks at first glance like a soir&eacute;e at a French chateau, where some of the guests wear modern-day formal dinner-party dresses while others wear 18th century costumes.  Is it a fancy dress party where costumes are optional, or is the director attempting to make a distinction between modern and rather older-fashioned attitudes towards love and affairs?  Whatever the reason for the disparity, the dress, the corrupting behaviour and the attitudes expressed by this Don Alfonso in his assessment that women are not capable of being faithful is far from playful.  There's a suggestion rather that he has rather more sinister motives for setting the couples of Dorabella and Ferrando and Flordiligi and Gugliemo against each other.  His partner in crime Despina likewise seems to have a point to prove through her complicity in the events that ensue.

The allusions to near contemporary 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' might be coincidental (or just in my own mind), but they are certainly in the spirit of the method that Haneke employs here.  We might believe that our attitudes are more modern, sophisticated and enlightened than those expressed in the period of Mozart, Da Ponte and Choderlos de Laclos, but are we really all that different?  As in his film Hidden, Haneke typically suggests that there are deeper, darker, less acceptable impulses involved that we'd rather not openly acknowledge.  It's significant perhaps in this respect that there is no real effort made to put Ferrando and Gugliemo into convincing disguises that would fool their partners.  Their real feelings and baser impulses in the nature of their seduction of each other's partner is undisguised, and perhaps even the women know it and are complicit on some level too.  It's a rather mean-spirited view of the characters in Cos&igrave; Fan Tutte and of humanity in general, but what else would you expect from Michael Haneke?

If there's a characteristic cruelty in Haneke's reading of the work, there is however no violence expressed at all in the musical performance.  Sylvain Cambrelling's conducting of the Madrid orchestra is soft, delicate and as beautiful as the score is capable of being.  Rather than work against Haneke's intentions, the director uses the gentility of the performance here to complement or enhance the cool cynicism of his Don Alfonso.  The delicate musical arrangement and lightheartedness of the libretto create an unsettling and somewhat sinister contrast then with the Master's actual expressions, his gestures and the viciousness of his behaviour.  There's a similar dichotomy present in all of the characters and it's in the expression of this - as opposed to a concept that is somewhat questionable - that Haneke makes his own particular outlook on Cos&igrave; Fan Tutte work to some extent.

William Shimell, a baritone who has worked as an actor for Haneke (in the Oscar winning 'Amour') and for Abbas Kiarostami in 'Certified Copy' (and as it happens also played Don Alfonso in a Cos&igrave; for Aix-en-Provence directed by Kiarostami) is really the key player here and his acting is strong enough to make this kind of twist in his persona credible.  All of the cast however have clearly been well-directed and give strong performances with Anett Fritsch in particular standing out in the role of Flordiligi.  Haneke however is careful that any 'modifications' should not be at the expense of Mozart's writing and is very respectful of the vocal line.  He allows the cast to sing the roles faithfully, with full expression and in perfect accordance with the performance of the music and lets the stage direction alone carry the concept.  It's not a perfect Cos&igrave; then, Haneke taking the characters rather far from Mozart's rather more generous view of human nature without being quite adventurous enough to really carry it off.  It does at least lead you to consider the work anew and question whether there aren't flaws in both views.",1382572800,18,4937,5.105721393034826
