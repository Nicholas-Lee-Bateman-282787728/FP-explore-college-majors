8282509,3,B001BAU9F4,"An obvious first effort, but I think people should ease up on the producer.  It's a story that needed to be told and I don't really see anyone else stepping up to tell it.  If anything this scene has taught us, it's to not sit around waiting for someone else to do it for you.  I mean, where's your Gilman St. Documentary?  Oh yeah, you don't have one (neither do I).  Jack Curran does.
Regardless of that, the major gripe I have is the blatantly obvious decision to leave out the stories of individuals, bands, and labels that went on to be associated with major labels and/or no longer fit in with the ethics of the Gilman crowd.  Which is ridiculous.  You are making a historical document.  You don't pick and choose the parts you like and erase the parts you're not so proud of.  If it happened, it's part of the story, it happened.  That's like writing the history of baseball and leaving out Ty Cobbs because he was a horrible person.
It's a neat thing to have.  I do not regret buying it.  But it's not entertaining and the editor lacks a knack for storytelling.  I would love to see a professional get the master tapes, build on it, and put together a new Gilman doc.",1479427200,,1175,4.334862385321101
8282510,3,B001BAU9F4,"Although I'm a huge Lookout! Records fan and love most of the bands who started their careers at this venue, the documentary seems somewhat rushed, lacks a lot of expected details, and doesn't quite deliver. It will be good enough for anyone interested in bands like Green Day who got their start here but to someone who doesn't know anything about it, I doubt this will turn them on to the music and make them go out hunting for the regular bands who frequented the venue. I hate to be so harsh but I feel there is another documentary waiting to be made that can satisfy the hunger for the great story that is Gilman Street.",1373846400,,625,4.396551724137931
8282511,3,B001BAU9F4,"This 2008 zero-budget video documentary is Example 147a of a project that should have maxed out at sixty minutes but aspired to be something more (betterer)substantial. 924 Gilman Street opens with an attempt at structure by driving the highways and streets leading to the club, with voiceovers circling the raison d'etre for the space. Then there's bits about how the club came to be, but soon it falls into the cycle of foggy live clips and interview snippets that say a lot of words but don't add to much beyond how great and cool and necessary and fortunate and enriching and whatever else Gilman Street represents to all its miscreant children.

I read the book 924 Gilman Street so even if it isn't I viewed this as a companion piece. The book is more honest (even if by accident) about the ugly truths hidden behind the utopian rhetoric of the project, but at least they allow Jesse Michaels of Operation Ivy to comment on the sometimes unwanted influence of hardline socialists and their demands for physical labor and political purity. The dvd is a fundraiser for the club, distributed by Alternative Tentacles (Virus 381) with the pre-emptive strike of stating ""So have some class and pay for it"".

It's best to dedicate 60 minutes tops to this dvd, so after the first ten minutes forward to anywhere and see how long you can last. Go back randomly and do the same. Pick another point and... you get the point. If you're really into the importance of really important things maybe you'll want to watch all of it AND the extras, more of the same but where else do you have to be anyway?

Maybe my problem is that I don't yearn to belong or to build, or to destroy the system and replace it with whatever it is I learned in kindergarten about sharing, respect, and responsibility. If someone made a film about my fondest musical years (78-82) I surely wouldn't want it sugarcoated with BS like this one does fairly harmlessly. I don't want the arse of my nostalgia kissed. A much more honest film would be about how the club has survived in spite of all that's gone wrong or doesn't come close to being true in terms of stated goals vs. reality.",1330819200,,2153,4.587012987012987
8282512,5,B001BAU9F4,"The most famous address in punk rock is certainly deserving of a film like this, and the good folks at Alternative Tentacles are donating the proceeds from the sale of this DVD to the venue, which is a volunteer-run collective dedicated to providing a safe, friendly, and always-available space for artists and followers of all things punk to do what they do. The film combines interviews with Gilman volunteers, artists (including Ian MacKaye, Jello Biafra, Blake from Jawbreaker, and members of The Offspring, amongst many others), performance footage from throughout the venue's history (including a young Pinhead Gunpowder, Citizen Fish, DSB, Screeching Weasel, Abandon, and some other amazing stuff), and lots of behind-the-scenes film, photos, and information. Punk supporters--even those who have never been to Berkeley--owe it to themselves and to the artists that they love to check this out.",1293926400,,901,5.442857142857143
