1674756,4,B00005Y6XO,"anybody who knows me knows that The Elements are My All-Time Favorite Group.always glad to see them Live.but my knocks are Missing Maurice White,because it's hard for me seeing the Group without it's leader. Philip Bailey held things down but still Maurice was Needed.the Band while Still Quite Good didn't move me like the 70's Version.if you caught EWF at the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame Show then you know what I Mean.the 70's Band Ripped the Hall Show up.and lastly I didn't care for the EWF Dancers.seems kinda trendy&out of place to me. but having said all of that they still are a Must see Band&they haven't lost a step.they still bring so much pure delight to my ears.",1020902400,8,671,4.647058823529412
1674757,4,B00005Y6XO,"A good collection of songs, Good stage performance. Great vocal performance of Philip Bailey although I would have expected to hear more of his personal collection. The phone conversations between songs (for the requests) are annoying. The sound is good and clear (Dolby Digital 5.1)  but I would have expected to have it on DTS format also as other ""Live By request"" DVD's I own. The live dancers add a colorful background  and make it a good live entertaining show which looks like was prepared pedantry and worth watching again and again. Includes all of EWF greates hits. Enjoy.",1015545600,,582,4.8686868686868685
1674770,5,B00005Y6XO,Great Gift! I gave it to my mom...,1426118400,,34,3.375
1674771,4,B00005Y6XO,The sound is better than the Chicago Live by request and they have dancing girls. Earth Wind and Fire is always going to play great so its just a matter of the presentation and production.  This one is pretty good. Even appearing to take requests and new members knowing half of their million songs playing them out of order is humbling as a musician.  This is a pretty good show.,1416873600,,380,4.414285714285715
1674772,5,B00005Y6XO,They are in a class by themselves,1414281600,,33,3.857142857142857
1674773,5,B00005Y6XO,"One of my favorite DVD performances by this group.  The members actually talk to call in people who request songs.  They did the classic, Boogie Wonderland, September, etc., and I could listen to these songs every day.",1398988800,,218,4.864864864864865
1674774,5,B00005Y6XO,"This dvd has most of Earth, Wind and Fire's major hits. This dvd will not only bring back great memories but will have you dancing . I watch it all the time.",1398729600,,157,3.9375
1674775,5,B00005Y6XO,I bought this DVD for my grown son. I used to listen to this music when he was just a baby I played it so much now he has grownup and it is in him too! Earth Wind and Fire is one of the best bands of all time. Their music is timeless and you still hear it in movies and on the radio. You can't miss whether cd or dvd. I wanted to see the band perform again.,1363651200,,357,3.5316455696202533
1674776,5,B00005Y6XO,I saw this Live By Request concert on A&E in 1999 when it first aired. I saw EWF in concert in September and what a show. Just wanted a little more of that live action. It's great!!!!,1356739200,,183,3.972972972972973
1674777,5,B00005Y6XO,"excellent concert  of the great Earth Wind and Fire.  They sing everyone's favorites and the performances are great as usual. Very entertaining and lots of fun, you can't sit still.",1353801600,,181,5.0
1674778,4,B00005Y6XO,As usual it's really good entertainment  by E W and Fire.  Any one who loves E. W and Fire music should have this DVD and will not have any regrets.,1331856000,,148,3.9
1674779,3,B00005Y6XO,"This is A&E special and viewers called in with requests. I bought EWF and Chicago in Concert and LOVE IT. I bought more, gave as gifts and everyone loved it. This is not as good, certainly EWF entertains but seemed A&E curtailed how they normally are.",1328313600,,251,4.478260869565218
1674780,5,B00005Y6XO,I am an avid EWF fan and did watch this on tv when it was on.  The video is great.  I recommend it to all!,1238284800,,106,3.2
1674781,2,B00005Y6XO,"This DVD is polished, with very nice sound quality, but it is way different than the original E W & F sound.  It's not just that Maurice is no longer singing, it's the lack of any real ""funk"" quality.  The original EW&F had a sound that was really defined by Verdine White's brilliant and driving bass, and while he is present at this concert, you can hardly hear him, and he playing seems to be subdued.  Also, the original Earth had two guitarists, Al McCay and Johnny Graham, often both playing rhythm, which also added a richness and funkyness to their sound.  This recent version of EW&F is polished and sanitized and lacks the ""umph"" of the original.  And the between songs requests and banter are just annoying and take away from the flow and feeling that this is a live event with any improvisation.  I wish someone would release a full concert from the mid-late 1970s, when these guys were at their peak and their concerts were truly amazing.  If only there were a companion DVD to Gratitude!  You can see bits of some of these concerts on YouTube and they demonstrate how vastly better the band was then.  The early 1980s Oakland concert is OK but by then they had become too commercial and Al McCay had left and the band was losing its mojo.",1233705600,4,1252,4.4801762114537445
1674782,4,B00005Y6XO,"EWF fans will truly enjoy this DVD! The overall production quality is top notch, the audio is great, and it is visually appealing. It has the look and feel of a very intimate performance. I think the editing was great. Rather than a lot of quick cuts and panning of the audience, the focus is on the performers for the most part. Also, unlike another reviewer, I felt that the dancers (which were used sparingly) added a visual element that enhanced those particular songs. And, with the exception of ""Shining Star"", which was a bit altered, all the other songs were true to their original recordings. The bottom line is that this is a very entertaining DVD and would be cherished by any EWF fan!",1190419200,2,696,4.576
1674783,5,B00005Y6XO,"I missed Maurice White, but I think the band is sounding as good and as powerful as ever. I think the dancers could have been ommited (this probably is one addition from their Las Vegas show, and don't get me wrong, the girls are beautiful and good dancers but unnecessary), and the ego of Philip Bailey minimized (just look at him and you will know what I mean) to leave room for other members to shine. My kids have listened to their music for years but now that they have seen them, they like EWF more. Great production, great sound, you will enjoy it and dance along.",1139529600,,571,4.345794392523365
1674784,5,B00005Y6XO,"The video is 1999, from A&E, and contrary to the Chicago appearance on ""live by request"" (whose sound was horrible...don't buy that DVD), this one was perfect.

The band plays all their major hits, about 17-18 tracks in all.  Long concert.  People have complained about Maurice White not being there, but Sheldon did a great job of replacing him, and Philip Bailey still strips the paint off walls with his voice.  What power and range!

The band is awesome (I'm a drummer, and would have loved to see Sonny Emory, but Gordon Campbell is equally a master on the drums, and actually sounds like Emory in his style).

This DVD is hot...and in DTS 5.1 sound....can't beat it.  Buy it today!",1100995200,20,687,4.628099173553719
1674785,5,B00005Y6XO,"THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. I ENJOY THIS CONCERT. I JUST DON'T LIKE THE INTERRUPTIONS. THE GROUP PERFORMED THEIR SONGS WELL. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY EARTH,WIND,AND FIRE FAN.",1095724800,,170,4.7
1674786,5,B00005Y6XO,"Long-time die-hard EWF fan. I have done their music live, there is no greater musical high.  This is a superbly produced DVD.  The arrangements take EWF to the highest levels yet. Musicanship (although not all-original band) is awesome.  Sound and video technology is near perfect.  If all my favorite bands did this quality of DVD production, I would never get anything done.",1087084800,13,376,5.016129032258065
1674787,5,B00005Y6XO,I can only recommend this DVD a million times! It makes me wanna dance and shout! I think that says it all...,1075939200,8,109,4.0
1674788,5,B00005Y6XO,"Though a die hard Maurice fan, I still had to grab this dvd and see how good it could be without the captain....they still take the house down.  The horns, Sheldon, Ralph, Verdine, and Philip are more than able to keep the high musical integrity of the band.  Listening to sheldon sing September and After The Love Is Gone, was different, but REALLY friggen cool!  This guy has a gem of a voice, so don't be led away from this dvd because Maurice isn't on it.  Listening to Ralph, Philip, and Sheldon share the vocals that Maurice did gives the audience a new way to appreciate the music, and is a purchase I'll never regret.",1059955200,10,625,4.408695652173913
1674789,5,B00005Y6XO,"CAN I LISTEN THE MUSIC ONLINE, WHEN I CAN TO DO THIS IN MY FAVORITE TIME, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MOVIES TOO(ONLINE)?",1041292800,,126,4.08
7956450,5,B00005Y6XO,I goofed up and didn't realize that it was NOT a blue ray. However the dvd as great quality with a great delivery package in 2 disks. The one I replaced was a blue ray in one disk. I lost the original one after having all my electronics wiped out due to a nearby electrical storm and the failure of a direct TV dish antenna being grounded. Check your dish antenna and be sure that it is properly grounded.,1521504000,,405,4.139240506329114
7956451,5,B00005Y6XO,"Fantastic production quality, and a treat to watch the dancers as they choreograph to EW&F's greatest hits. Loved the segment where they sing to 'Julie'. It's a small venue (Sony music studios in NYC), so it feels like you're right there - especially with the professional camera work. This may be as close as you'll get to a front row seat at one of their shows. If you're a fan and you love concert videos, you will crank this up and play it over and over again.",1480636800,,464,4.344827586206897
7956452,5,B00005Y6XO,"Great concert, however, could have done without the girls dancing in the middle of almost every song. It wasn't needed",1476316800,,118,4.95
