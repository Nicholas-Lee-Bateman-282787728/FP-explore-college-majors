8351695,5,B00262E3N0,"Amazon has two separate listings for what appears to be the same performance. The physical DVD and cover that I watched differ from this cover so I am not sure about the quality of the DVD and transfer but the performance is excellent.  This is what I wrote concerning this performance though I watched it on a DVD that had a different cover.  This is a studio recording but closely mimics what one would see on the stage. It is beautifully done. It appears to be virtually complete with few, if any, cuts. The diction is clear. The images and sound are excellent. All of the actors are excellent. No version of the Much Ado I have watched are as exciting as the Branagh film with the emphasized verbal jousting between Branagh and Thompson, the sweeping views of the Italian countryside and the rousing score, but for ""authentic"" Shakespeare done in a classical manner this BBC version is tops.",1374278400,4,895,4.622641509433962

8351697,5,B00262E3N0,"Enter this comedy with the image of the devil in mind. It is a diabolical tale of unrequited and unpunished treachery. But fate has it so that good prevails over the evil of that treacherous bastard brother of the prince.

This 1599 comedy is a satire of people who cannot hold their tongues and think that wit is all the best when it is cruel. Beatrice and Benedick have it quite right when they wittingly say: ""BEATRICE A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours. BENEDICK. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer."" The tongues of those witty young and not so young people are animals, wild and fast, and remember fast leads to quick and no one likes being hurt to the quick by some witty retort.

And they all know how bad a tongue can be when it becomes multiple. As Don Pedro says: ""'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues.' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.'"" And then that kind of multiple tongue can become the worst weapon you can imagine. And don't believe Cupid can be better with his tongue. ""He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks."" That clapper makes more noise and damage than the arrow of Cupid.

And Hero is slandered by the brother of the local prince and Claudio she was going to marry rejects her publicly in front of the friar who was to marry them. She faints in the process and the friar dissimulates the fainting into an announced death caused by the slandering and the grief. Few are in the secret that Antonio, Hero's uncle, sums up as follows: ""Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece; / And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains, / That dare as well answer a man indeed / As I dare take a serpent by the tongue. / Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!""

The father Leonato and his brother will force thus Claudio and the Prince to shame themselves and repent their crime. All the more because at this moment two ruffians who had been arrested during the night and tried in the morning are brought to the Prince and just as they had done with the judge, they do not hold their tongues and they spill out the whole truth about the bastard brother of the Prince financing them heftily to set up the fake nightly rendez-vous of Hero with some man.

Then on the following evening and in the night Claudio and the prince make penance for Hero's death at the funeral monument of her family. And Claudio hangs there his written epitaph to Hero. ""Done to death by slanderous tongues / Was the Hero that here lies: / Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, / Gives her fame which never dies. / So the life that died with shame / Lives in death with glorious fame.""

We know of course better and Shakespeare can finish up on the following morning with a ""masque"" of his own to present to Claudio who had accepted, Hero's cousin Beatrice he is supposed to marry as a punishment, and her personality is not exactly a gift of God. But the masks enable Claudio to marry Hero and discover her real identity when all is said. That enables then Benedick to marry Beatrice who he loves though she has the witty tongue of a viper. Another serpent who will be tamed like any shrew that Shakespeare put on the stage.

The bastard brother of the Prince will not be punished and we don't even know what happens to him, and who cares. The genius of this production is that the rhythm is really good and sustained as brisk from beginning to end. Then the artificiality of the situation and successive events are like some variations on themes we have already seen or met, like the false death of the girl (Romeo and Juliet), the ceremony in the family funeral monument (Romeo and Juliet but also Hamlet and Ophelia's burial, not to speak of Cleopatra's death) and many others. Of course we have two weddings (quite a common event in Shakespeare's plays though it is not enough to bring Juno down like in A Midsummer Night's Dream where there are four couples united or reunited at the same time.

This is probably the best part about this long trip of mine through Shakespeare's thirty-two plays. We find some themes and motifs, and every single time something comes back again, there is a variation on that something that makes it different. With a few ideas Shakespeare created a whole constellation of variations. He is a real dramatic jazzman of the stage.

8351698,5,B00262E3N0,"Robert Lindsay's performance as Benedick alone makes this brilliant production a necessity for everyone who loves this play, but those playing Beatrice, Don Pedro, Hero, Claudio, and Leonato are equally superlative.

Though when cast in this production he was well known on the British stage, Lindsay isn't well known to American audiences except those few who have seen him as Commodore (later Admiral) Sir Edward Pellew in the Horatio Hornblower series starring Ioan Gruffudd.

Here, Lindsay's comic timing is perfection, and his speeches come alive in the way Shakespeare can when done truly well.

If you must choose only one performance of this clever comedy, this is the one to choose. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson did a masterful job in their later production, but Branagh made a few missteps and comes off poorly at times by comparison. (His kicking up water in the fountain seems almost effeminate.) And Keanu Reeves isn't up to the difficult task of playing Don Jon. The only performance I consider better in the Branagh version is Michael Keaton's inspired job as Dogberry.",1278115200,10,1089,5.106741573033708
8351699,5,B00262E3N0,"Lindsey especially captured the choice between believing his friends wrong to dishonor Hero and believing in her innocence. You really can believe in his love for Beatrice at that moment. And the misuse of words by Dogberry is so much more enjoyable without Keaton's slapstick and posturing which I find very hard to watch (although I will admit the accent can be a bit thick). I checked the VHS copy (tried to buy my own but at that time I would have had to been a school or institution and the price was ridiculous) out from my local library so many times it might just as well have been considered lost by the library staff. When the BBC/Time-Life boxed sets came out in the America, I was disappointed that Much Ado About Nothing wasn't included in the comedies set. So I was very pleased to learn that I could order individual plays from the same publisher and this was the first one I added to my personal library. In truth I like it better than the Branagh production.
  I also ordered Measure For Measure as no one else seems to have done that one in a video format. I must admit I would be very interested to see how Kenneth Branagh or Trevor Nunn would handle it's themes of judgement, law enforcement, mercy and sexual harrasment. I suspect it has become something of a 'problem' play because of those themes but I can't help wondering.",1245024000,2,1347,4.493877551020408
