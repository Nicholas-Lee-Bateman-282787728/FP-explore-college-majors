Moving Target changes names and locations, but the premise and the general course of the plot remains the same as its predecessor. Die-hard Wilson fans may consider this a step down, given decrease in star power and production values, but personally, I think its a minor improvement over the so-so original.

The story: An American kickboxer (Wilson) visiting Ireland is caught up in a deadly manhunt when he comes into possession of a case of beer containing nuclear detonators sought by the IRA.

The films lack of widely-recognizable performers, handheld camerawork, and fleeting tone give the film a kind of throwaway feel, like something produced for television. For general viewers this may be an unshakable qualm, but I think the films one main strength helps make this an above-average feature for Wilson. The quality of the fight scenes is relatively strong, thanks in part to a good stunt ensemble. Don tends to prefer one-sided brawls, but a few of the nine fights feature a lot more back & forth action than the mans norm, with his initial bout against Bill Murphy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spacejacked/dp/B0001KNHPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spacejacked</a>) setting the tone for a slightly more mortal performance from The Dragon. Occasional slow motion and sloppy choreography keep this one from really shining, but overall, I declare it enjoyable.

The plot can be a little confusing at times when it comes to the IRA inter-faction rivalry, but for the most part this is standard action stuff and easily digestible. Some things make the story stand out, including the Irish setting and Wilsons relationship to his onscreen girlfriend Eileen McCloskey. The first part of the movie wherein Dons character tests the waters of new surroundings and a new romance make for some cozy viewing; I almost wish the movie were simply about a tourist in Ireland without the action portionsor at least without the thriller storyline.

Don Wilsons tremendous foothold within the low-budget scene would allow him to hold onto his solo career longer than other action stars of his status following the crash of the video market, and Moving Target is an example of how he was able to roll with the punches as adeptly as if this were a kickboxing match. Fans of the man ought to give it a try, and B-movie lovers in general might have some fun with it, too. Everyone else, though, can stay away.",1446681600,,2790,5.421658986175115

7897165,4,630584836X,I cant agree with the last reviewer if indeed you could call what he/she wrote a review. I enjoyed it. Some of the acting was suspect but Bill Murphy and Terry Mcmahon more than made up for the weeknesses. The fight scenes between Bill and Don were  realistic and truly powerful. Bills intensity is explosive and terry is truly menacing.,974764800,2,337,4.616666666666666
