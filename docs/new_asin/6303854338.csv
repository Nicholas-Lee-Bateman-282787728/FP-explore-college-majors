7854964,4,6303854338,"Johnny Mack Brown was one of the great B-Western heroes.  He had been an All-America running back at the University of Alabama.  As an athlete-turned-actor he was pretty good, better than Sammy Baugh (""King of the Texas Rangers"") but not as skilled as Buster Crabbe (""Flash Gordon"").  He actually started out as a leading-man type at MGM, but his soft southern accent didn't go over too well with the transition to sound.  Having been a star at MGM, he easily got a chance at other studios and made the transition to Westerns.

His two side-kicks in this picture are also interesting.  Raymond Hatton (1887-1971) appeared in nearly 500 movies.  Walter Miller, another movie veteran, plays the gambler Deacon; you'll note that almost every line he speaks has gambling connotations.  Harry Woods is one of the all-time great bad guys.  He plays Rocky with a lot of class; in one scene he displays real emotion at the death of one of his men, which is most unusual for a serial villain.

This serial shows its age in the photography and the sound, but if one sticks wirth it it's a very interesting Western.  It's well-plotted and the acting is good all around.  It has an unusually large cast.  Universal wasn't noted for its fist-fights in serials (as Republic was), but the fight in Chapter Nine is one of the all-time greats.  Unfortunately some of the cliffhangers, especially in the first half of the picture, aren't very clever.  In Chapter Seven Johnny Mack is clearly shot and falls head-first into a well, only to climb out in the next chapter uninjured.  Another downer, typical of the time, is that the Indians are presented as blood-thirsty savages; Johnny Mack and others constantly refer to them as ""red devils.""  A lot of the Indians are real Native Americans, including Chief Thundercloud, who later played Tonto in the Lone Ranger serials, and Olympic champion Jim Thorpe.",1136678400,,1887,4.8286604361370715

7854966,5,6303854338,"That's right, there's more gunsmoke per shootout, and there are a lot of them, in this serial than I've ever seen. Looks great. Lots of good riding scenes and there are a lot of wagon chases, too. All those things make for a great western serial. Johnny is younger and more enthusiastic than I've seen him before. I love his gloves. I had a pair almost like them when I was a kid - I slept with them under the pillow the first night. He rescues the gal practically every ten minutes, it seems. Yet at other times, Joyce Compton plays her as one spunky lady. She rides right into the thick of trouble when the man she loves is in danger. And she can saddle a horse, too. No clinging vine, this lady.

Raymond Hatton and Walter Miller really add interest as Johnny's sidekicks. Drinking and gambling are their interests respectively, and they pursue them whenever possible, at least until Johnny has another job for them, which seems to happen whenever they start to drink and gamble. Being a sidekick is a tough job. Harry Woods is not just a bad guy. There is a scene where he emotes to the loss of one of his cohorts - a nice touch. Usually bad guys are just bad guys, you know?

As in a lot of the early westerns, things look real, not slick and Hollywoody as in a lot of later ones. All the buildings are made of logs, in both Red Dog (the rustler hang-out) and Nugget.

I really enjoyed this one. Well worth it.",1132012800,7,1415,4.292134831460674
