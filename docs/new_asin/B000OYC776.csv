Playing stupid is not easy, but these three nail it with such grace and aplomb that I gave them a standing ovation ... although I was sitting at the time and not clapping.

Also, Sean Stewart? Oh man, he nailed it as the world's most unlikable person. I hope the Oscar voters keep him in mind when it comes time. A riveting performance of a heartbreaking and sad life. Bravo!

What I respected most was the way these three actually were so convincingly delusional in that were going somewhere with their careers! Hysterically played, lads! Only sychophants of their rich fathers would ever give them the time of day!",1346976000,,747,4.828125

Sean Stewart is one of my favorite people and never fails to entertain! Watch the ups and downs and the many parties, you can't get enough. If you like to laugh and be entertained, buy this DVD series!",1324771200,,375,4.295774647887324
