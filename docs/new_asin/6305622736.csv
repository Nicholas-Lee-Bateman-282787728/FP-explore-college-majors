1051859,1,6305622736,"Candyman 3:  Day of the Dead, such a terrible movie, I found myself wondering ""Who in the hell could like this movie?""  Surely not the people whom flipped for the original film. Candyman (1992) is a very  scary film, Clive barker's story was frightening and interesting, this  second hand follow up turns the hook handed phantom into a sixth or seventh  rate Freddy knock off, I found myself praying to get a glimpse of the  BEAUTIFUL female lead in this movie naked, for that would of helped the  proceedings along a little bit.  But when that is what you find yourself  wishing for when watching a sequel to the modern classic, you know that all  the lousy FX, sixth grade screenplay and terrible acting have killed the  hopes for a decent Candyman sequel.",949276800,7,758,4.62406015037594
1051860,3,6305622736,"I enjoyed the first two films in the ""Candyman"" series and I was excited to rent the third film (featuring Baywatch babe Donna D'errico). It wasn't at all what I expected and I can't decide if that's a bad or good  thing. The plot is kind of dull and simple yet there is some originality in  it. The acting wasn't all that great, but the special effects were pretty  good. It has a fair amount of violent and lots of gore, but it isn't that  scary. That is what makes it different from its prequels. So, I wouldn't  recommend you renting this if you want to be scared.

1052017,2,6305622736,"From Al Septien and Turi Meyer, the folks who brought you such blockbusters as Leprechaun 2 and Chairman of the Board (yes, the one with Carrot Top). After a thoroughly pointless intro, Candyman 3 gives a crash course in the history of Daniel Robitaille (otherwise known as Candyman). We're introduced to Caroline (Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch), Daniel's great great granddaughter, trying her best to not look like a deer caught in the headlights (she is not successful). A stranger gives her some candy. Quite literally sweets to the sweet. Maybe they thought that was clever? Caroline's friend Miguel is putting on a showing of Candyman's artwork. There's a slightly altered re-telling of the origin, perhaps from Miguel's understanding. Or maybe they were just lazy. Caroline then gets peer pressured into saying his name five times into the mirror in front of the art gallery crowd. Did I mention she seems to forget her bra on every occasion? This is perhaps why Candyman wants to get it on with a relative. Look at me, trying to make sense of this. Later, the paintings are stolen and Miguel is killed. The bumbling detectives (""bad cop/bad cop"") are on Caroline's case, thinking she's the Candyman. Where have I heard this before? Trying to interfere is the son of the 4th Ghostbuster, Ernie Hudson, Jr. Because they couldn't get the 4th Ghostbuster. Incredibly, Candyman suffers the same fate as the Leprechaun in Leprechaun 2.

1052061,2,6305622736,"Caroline mistakenly resurrects the spirit of her murderous ancestor, the Candyman, during the opening of an art exhibit that is being held in his honor, unleashing another wave of terror throughout the streets of Los Angeles during the Day of the Dead celebration. CANDYMAN 3 is filled with ridiculous racial stereotypes, dreadful dialog, and pitiful performances. Playboy Playmate Donna D'Errico only has two things going for her, and they aren't her sharp wit or keen acting prowess. She is simply atrocious in the lead, and would have been better off sticking with Baywatch. Turi Meyer doesn't do much better as director, creating very little suspense or atmosphere as he turns away from the Gothic ghost story and embraces the Slasher genre. His attempt to recreate the stylish and moody Mardi Gras sequence from the second film falls flat. Worst off is poor Tony Todd, who desperately tries to carry the weight of the film himself, but whose performance ultimately suffers from the sophomoric script. This sequel is best left forgotten.

Cast:  Tony Todd, Donna D'Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr.

Running Time:  93 minutes

Rated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language.

The third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, ""Day of the Dead"" (they can't even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him.

There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first ""Candyman"" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he's right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage.",1135900800,6,2840,4.722672064777328
1052068,2,6305622736,Clive Barker did a good job on the original Candyman. It was truly a cut above most horror movies. The second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous. There is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable. Donna D'Errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks. Lets hope this is the last sequel.,1127606400,,349,4.147058823529412
1052089,2,6305622736,"The saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}.

As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien & director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little.

 There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable.",1117584000,2,1461,4.101398601398602
1052090,3,6305622736,"After the classic Candyman, this is a good sequel. I think this is a much better movie than part 2. Part 2 I have mixed feelings on, it's not a great movie, but with this third entry in the series, I think  it a not bad sequel. I'm not claiming it's an amazing film, but it is good. The two leads of Nick Corri and Donna D'Errico were good. I love Nick Corri-very sexy. (He should be remembered for 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' as rod lane).

If your a fan of the series, then this is a must in the collection.",1107907200,9,509,3.980392156862745
1052091,3,6305622736,"Taken on its own - without having seen Candyman 1 and 2 - I may well have enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did, because, it's far from garbage; it just never gets close to the bar the others set.  It's techically well-made, but lacking on several fronts.  My main fault is that the Candyman character's essence seemed to get lost somewhere - previously he was a horrifying but tragic figure, a monster where you can see why he became what he is; whereas here he comes off just evil, not sympathetic or tragic at all, and his prevoiusly poetic lamentations come across weakly, almost whiny at times, which was definately not the case in the first 2 movies.  He veers dangerously close to being just 'evil-for-evil's sake', like Freddy Krueger, instead of the way he was.  That works well for the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies; Freddy is Supposed to be a totally evil, unsympathetic fiend without a single redeeming trait in his burned body - that's one of the main things that made the Elm Streets (the best of them, anyway) so excellent and the Freddy character one of the great horror icons.  Candyman is a great horror icon too but for entirely different reasons, and it seems to me that kind of got lost in here.

  I don't mean to be unnecessarily harsh. ""Candyman: Day Of The Dead"" certainly has its good points - solid production, some beautiful California scenery (not the least of which is female lead Donna D'Errico), an unnerving and terrific opening sequence, and another fine performance by Candyman Tony Todd, who manages to impress even with significantly weaker material to work with.  It was a valiant attempt by the filmmakers (who did better on the movie ""Sleepstalker: Last Rites Of the Sandman""), and I guess I'd still recommend this for Candyman fans - some people may enjoy this more than I did - but in my mind it's still a big comedown from what came before.  I hope the 4th installment will be a step back up.",1098576000,13,1941,4.583815028901734

1052093,2,6305622736,"I LOVED Candyman 1, I LIKED Candyman 2, but Candyman 3 just didn't grab me. The series here goes direct-to-video and it really hurts the film. It just feels and looks cheaper than the first two. The story also isn't all that special. There just isn't anything new to do with Candyman. Tony Todd does a good job as the title role, by Donna De'errico leaves a bad taste in the mouth and makes the film seem really [inferior]. Whenever a baywatch beauty is featured in movie, it just makes the movie seem poor. Candyman fanatics may find some mild interest int he film, but it is passable. I really hope they end the series here. Part 3 is almost too much and a part 4 would push the series over the edge. But since the franchise is now owned by artisian home entertainenment, they will probably fork out another direct-to-video entry within the next five years.

Yet, out of the three that are out now, this is my least favorite of the series. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie but seems to lack the creepiness of the first two.(Not even the gratuitous bra/panty and T&A shots could save this movie, I'm afraid, and there's alot more in here than the previous two. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.) It's just that the first two movies took more of a visceral approach to the horror and this movie seems to take a back seat to it. There's too much recapping going on about his life history, which is fine for those new to the series, but too much emphasis is put on it. Us Hardcore Candyman fans already know all about it. All in all, though, everyone gives a good performance in the movie. It's a good, decent Candyman movie but one I feel coulda been better. Much better.
If and when they come out with a fourth in the series, I do hope and pray they don't make it come out like this one. Candyman is a good creepy series that shouldn't be tarnished by giving that creepiness a back seat.",1039564800,2,1161,4.30593607305936

He  kills  a  bunch  of  people  with  the  hook  for  his  hand(  typical  ),  which  is  explicitly  dull  if  you  HAVE  seen  the  first  to  films,  most  of  it  is  just  repetative.  But  fear  not,  there  is  not  all  lost  in  this  latest  entry!  There  is  a  plot  element  that  I  particuarlly  enjoyed  about  this  entry.  In  this  one,  it  is  kind  of  like  a  battle  amongst  the  characters  in  which  they  were  all  trying  to  blame  each  other  on  who  commited  the  Candyman  murders.  Will  Caroline  be  blamed?  Or  will  it  be  Detective  Sam  and  his  partner  or  Caroline's  recent  boyfriend?  I  won't  tell,  or  say  that  it  is  not  predictible.
CHARACTERS:  Caroline(  Donna  D'Errico  )  fills  up  her  horror  role  as  the  babe  trying  to  survive  from  the  maniac(  cough,  typical  ).  She  is  also  probably  the  only  way  the  movie  team  was  able  to  put  this  B-  movie  out  to  Blockbuster,  and  they  use  her  and  Tony  for  the  advertising(  check  out  the  back  cover  and  you'll  get  me  ).  Tony  Todd  is  same  old,  same  old,  again.  Detective  Jamal  is  kinda  cool  but  we  don't  see  enough  of  him.  The  racist  cops  are  the  only  other  new  aspect  to  this  entry,  and  they  are...(  cough,  cough,  typical  ).  Caroline's  boyfriend  was  on  the  original  NIGHTMARE  ON  ELM  STREET,  besides  that,  he  is  boring.
  SUMMARY:  This  is  no  doubt  a  B-  movie.  The  horror  movie  cliches  are  noticable  and  the  plot  is  mostly  predictacle.  The  ending  was  old  and(  cough,  cough,  cough,  typical  )  .On  a  positive  note,  this  one  is  more  compact  and  contains  less  plot  holes  than  the  previous  films.  And  it  is  easily  the  DARKEST  in  the  series,  which  was  a  very  unpredictable  step  above  Part  2's  enthusiastic  feel.
  AND:  Yo  Candyman  fans!  This  is  NOT  a  trilogy  series.  On  UPCOMMING  HORROR  MOVIES.COM  it  is  said  that  Tony  Todd  tells  some  magizine  or  something  that  there  IS  a  greenlighted  sequel  comming  sometime!  Keep  waiting!",1011484800,2,3028,4.525862068965517

A young woman named Caroline is having strange nightmares concerning the killer known as 'Candyman.' Soon, she discovers that she is the great-great granddaughter of Candyman, and he has come to kill her. This is another good sequel in the CANDYMAN series, but I also hope that this is the last one they ever make because I don't think they could make any more interesting stories about the Candyman.",1003449600,,483,4.563218390804598
1052119,5,6305622736,"I like the candyman movies. I've never seen the second one but will buy it when it comes out on DVD. The first one was okay. It was very scary. The only thing that it didn't have as much gore as the 3rd one does. But it does have quite some. The movie is about a man that was a slave and was killed by being covered in homey and then covered in a swarm of bees. His right hand then was chopped off and a bloody hook was jammed on. He came back. Anytime someone would look into a mirror and say his name (candyman) five times, he would appear and kill them by gutting them though their stomach neormous times causing guts and blood to go everywhere with his hook. It's a pretty good series. The third one is the best and especially on the DVD. Ithas great sound and picture quality. It only has a trailer. I wish they had a commentary or a documentary on the series. It still is good.",998784000,,883,4.051428571428572
1052120,4,6305622736,"I really am not a great fan of the Candyman franchise, but after giving this a go, it restored my faith. Daniel Robertaille(Tony Todd) returns once again to play the infamous 'Candyman' in a sequel that is better and far more creepier than the first two, and yes dare I say, more watchable then the first film. What I liked about this was it was much more surreal and darker. The acting was nothing special, but who cares? It stars Donna D'errico (from... 'Baywatch') and Nick Corri (Rod Lane from 'Nightmare on Elm St'). The ending isn't too bad.... In my opinion, if you are to watch any of the 3 'candyman' films then this is the one I highly reccomend. ...The mind boggles, but don't be put off!",973814400,3,699,4.426356589147287
1052121,1,6305622736,"This film was very disapointing end to it's predescessors.  In Candyman, the original and it's sequel were written by Clive Barker of whom wrote many classic horror films including Hellraiser but this one was written by an entirely written author.
Anyway, the story continues off in the same fashion.  Caroline, the great great grandaughter of Daniel Rubok (aka Candyman) is having some nightmares, nightmares of her relation coming to murder her.  That is when she utters his name 5 times.
Candyman has come for her, to claim the last of his bloodline.
Sounds good doesn't it?  Or is it what we heard before?
This film was purely made to squeeze whatever was left in the series.
To keep the male audience happy, Caroline is a beautiful blonde bombshell who makes them look.
But the acting is atrocious on her part.  Her screams are such a joke and as for the other cast, that speaks for itself. The nudity was totally unnecessary which seemed to mask the true horror of the film.  Tony Todd, the Candyman's acting was very much missed in this film.  The same storyline exists in this film, and nothing ever changes. Candyman frames his relative with his murders and his classic ""Be my victim"" still remains but the plot never changes. Also what was missing was the excellent piano score that the previous two had.  A sad hypnotic piece it was was replaced by some atrocious music rubbish. Overall an awful film that shouldn't have been produced at all. I rest my case",970185600,6,1468,4.70703125

It basically has the same plot of the other two installments, but still has lame murder sequences and  poor scripting that doesn't make it anything special.

7892103,3,6305622736,"Obviously not as great as the first one, but I think better than the second.

More of a cult classic (think Halloween III, Jason X, Idle Hands, Sleepaway Camp, Freddie Vs. Jason, etc.), and not as bad as people make it out to be.

Donna D'Errico does OKAY in the lead role but she was never meant to be a full-on actress, and I think most people (even her) would accept this.

I do like the mystique and creative aspect of the horror or death scenes with the Candyman - well versed and unique :)

**One last little tidbit - Chris Van Dahl (ex-L.A. Guns singer, ex- Love/Hate, ex-Cherry St ., and current singer of popular Aerosmith tribute band AEROMYTH) plays a small role as ""Dante"".  Black hair, tattoos, mouth piercing.  Just a footnote for those who may not know.

Overall, I'd give this 3 out of 5 stars.  It's not that bad, and for a B movie 3rd part installment, it's more of a Cult Classic type.",1489536000,,904,4.339285714285714
