8337738,5,B001RDDXC6,Art Wolfe and team visit some of the mostly pristine cultural and natural environments in the world and captures them with breathtaking photography. I found myself even freeze framing portions of the video to study the images as they are composed of beautiful color and pattern that can't be fully appreciated in the speed at which they pass in the video. The sound tracts are great too.  A revelation of the profound beauty of our world for those who pause to look.,1379203200,,466,4.682926829268292
