8676651,5,B00N9BRAJ6,"This is a spellbinding performance by Dr. John Cobb and Christopher Tavernier.  Dr. Cobb is an international pianist extraordinaire and Christopher, his 14 year old prodigy, plays with such dexterity and gusto that his hands blur as you will see in the Tchaikovsky Concerto.  The two of them provide an enriching, inspiring experience.  You will stand in awe as the audience did who attended this concert.  And - whether you are 14 or 44 - it will make you want to go home and practice, practice, practice.  :)  Julie Gordon, Hendersonville, NC.",1433462400,,545,4.869565217391305
