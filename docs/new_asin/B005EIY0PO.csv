4665469,5,B005EIY0PO,"Hood to Coast is such a fun movie! They really did a great job of capturing the experience and the excitement of a race like this. You don't have to be a runner to love this movie, but if you are a runner this will make you want to take on an adventure just like hood to coast. My friends and I run these types of races, so we love watching Hood to Coast as we remember our own similar experiences. The film follows groups of completely different runners, some elite and some that have to stop and walk. And it's so great to see how incredible ALL of their experiences are in the race. I love this film and I'll be sharing it with all my friends. It's definitely worth the price!",1315440000,,679,4.112781954887218
4665470,5,B005EIY0PO,"Loved this movie! Saw it in the theater and then couldn't wait to purchase the DVD. It also inspired me as a runner, to actually run the Hood to Coast relay that the movie is about. It was great still seeing some of the people/teams highlighted in the movie on the course running the relay again this year.
This DVD is packed with extra features that I really enjoyed including catching up with some of the players in the ""where are they now"" feature. Also there are quite a few deleted scenes that are fun to watch. This is a great collection to your running DVD library and one you will watch again and again! This movie should even appeal to non runners as a testament to the strength of the human spirit and determination.",1315440000,,726,4.385185185185185
4665471,5,B005EIY0PO,"This documentary about an epic, long-distance, team-based race will inspire anyone, even if you're not a runner. The production crew picked a great set of individuals to profile, people with stories that we can all identify with in some way. There's plenty of humor without sacrificing the gravity of the teams' different reasons and motivations for completing the race.  The way the race is explained is clear and concise, the footage is beautiful, and between the stories, the filming and production, the movie truly engenders the excitement, spirit and camaraderie runners feel with one another during a race.  This movie will make runners want to go out and run, and show non-runners what runners see in pounding the pavement for miles at a time.",1314835200,,750,5.040322580645161
4665472,5,B005EIY0PO,"This presentation of an independently produced/directed documentary chronicling the trials and triumphs of four teams competing in the annual Oregon-based Hood to Coast event features an excellent transfer of the film with care paid to sound, picture quality and index/access points.  The second disc contains extras that are not 'fluffs' but substantial supplements that will enhance the overall viewing experience, whether the viewer is a runner or not.  The overall level of presentation, packaging and content is substantially better than the usual offerings from the major studios (shame on them!), and definitely worth the reasonable price.  I bought two copies!",1313539200,2,668,5.66
4665473,5,B005EIY0PO,"As a runner who runs for the mental and physical benefits of the sport this documentary spoke to me.  It embodies the true emotion and the joy of running - while still showing a team that just did the race to say they did, although they were so not prepared it was comical to them and the audience.  A wonderfully done movie and I believe runner and non-runners alike could take something away from watching it.",1313193600,6,411,4.394736842105263
4665474,5,B005EIY0PO,"Watched in a theater 6 months ago, and could not wait to get a copy - the documentary is so great, and it's finally available for purchase! It captures the spirit of the race, as well as spirit of people who do this wonderfuly crazy run... You won't regret the purchase.",1313020800,7,270,4.313725490196078

4665476,5,B005EIY0PO,Very well done and an inspiring documentary for those of us contemplating entering this race.,1468972800,,93,5.266666666666667
4665477,5,B005EIY0PO,"This was a well done, and fun documentary! Although my wife cried through one of the three story lines, I would recommend it to others.",1466812800,,135,4.44
4665478,5,B005EIY0PO,Ran a similar race in Texas called the Texas Independence Relay on a smaller scale and would like to run this event.,1462838400,,116,4.318181818181818
4665479,2,B005EIY0PO,the pace of the movie was almost as slow as the two teams it documented,1460851200,,71,3.8
4665480,5,B005EIY0PO,"I was lucky enough to run Hood to Coast with my brother several years ago. Ever since then, my competitive (in a fun way) girlfriend has been dying to run it as well. When we saw that this DVD was available, we couldn't wait to get a copy! It was everything we'd hoped for--inspirational, touching, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. We thoroughly enjoyed following the journeys of several racers of all ages. The film only made my girlfriend want to run it that much more.

Unfortunately, her team never got picked in the lottery and now she's battling Lyme disease so her running days are over for awhile. But she still enjoys watching this DVD from time to time and holding on to hope for what the future might bring her. Fingers crossed!

If you love sports documentaries and/or running, this one might be for you!",1457049600,,815,4.613793103448276
4665481,5,B005EIY0PO,Ran the race back in 2006 and was one of the most fun and rewarding things that I have ever done. This dvd did a great job capturing the experience and easily brought me back 10 years to relive the race. Enjoyed the stories told from different perspectives. Highly recommend.,1455753600,,275,4.52
4665482,5,B005EIY0PO,"I love this movie. The guy with the pink hair, Jason Baldwin, is my son-in-law, and seeing him on the big screen (I went to the premiere in Portland) was so exciting. Such a heartfelt telling of the experiences that brought everyone to the race.
A couple years later, in August, I walked past a camper van with HtC painted on the side, and people in running gear, etc. We started talking and I asked if they had seen the movie. Yes, and it was great, they said. I told them I was Jason's mother-in-law and they were so impressed! They said Mexico thinks he's cool. So, yeah, the movie has brought international fame!",1453420800,,616,4.412280701754386
4665483,4,B005EIY0PO,"This was a great motivating movie that we watched right before we ran Hood to Coast!  Runners will love this and identify with this, but non runners might get bored.  The movie follows several teams of varying abilities and motivators, so there is broad appeal for different types of runners.  However, I felt it spent way too much time on the stories, and way little time on the actual race itself.  It could have provided more information on the course and some of the challenges running such an amazing race and for that it fell short for me.  But this is no reason not to watch the movie  - it was a great experience running this race, and the movie does a decent job of capturing some of it.

Note: I paid full price for this product.  I did NOT receive this product at a discounted price in return for my unbiased review",1452038400,,826,4.352941176470588
4665484,5,B005EIY0PO,I ran this a few years ago and had a great time.  This was fun to watch because I experienced it in person.  Not sure how enjoyable it would be if you haven't run this before.,1450915200,,175,3.8333333333333335

4665488,5,B005EIY0PO,"Loved this documentary!  Being from Michigan and just participating in my first 200 mile relay with a 6 man wrecking crew, I could appreciate the insight into each team and their thoughts.  It was fun and inspirational.  I am looking forward to doing more of these type events!  My 12 year old son even enjoyed it.  The ""power arch"" will become part of my running group traditions :)",1445212800,,383,4.573529411764706

4665497,4,B005EIY0PO,I watched this after doing HTC but would recommend watching before to get excited.,1419897600,,82,4.928571428571429
4665498,5,B005EIY0PO,"I ran the hood to coast in 2007. Love this running moving. wish they can make more like it. Some sad stuff, but the music helps you from not crying like a ball bag. great quality, great stories of real every day people who show you what life is worth living. My new motivation movie, not to make me fast or slow, but remembering why I run, and why I love it.",1416355200,,358,3.986111111111111
4665499,4,B005EIY0PO,"Great film for hardcore runners as well as someone looking for a feel good documentary.

I wouldn't put this in the category of 'must-see' but this is a filler documentary that highlights the positive attributes of an extreme event. This film gives an you a view inside the van of a team of runners completing a nearly 200 mile race from Mt. Hood to the beach of the Pacific Ocean, hence the Hood to Coast title.

There are three teams that are followed and interviewed, which includes pre-race and post race interviews, some of which are very touching while at the other time some are lighthearted and funny.

The most important element is to glean the motivations of these runners as to why they would subject themselves to such torture. As someone who has run a similiar race to Hood to Coast this was the most fascinating part for me.

Ultimately I think you will enjoy this film but don't trip over yourself to watch it.",1410998400,,925,4.554216867469879
4665500,5,B005EIY0PO,Enjoyed the show.  Gave me a better perspective of the hood to coast race.,1409270400,,74,4.285714285714286
4665501,5,B005EIY0PO,"Loved it , watched this movie to see what to expect when I run HTC 2014.  Made me laugh and cry . Overall 5 stars for me :)",1408406400,,123,3.392857142857143
4665502,3,B005EIY0PO,The bonus disk doesn't work correctly. I returned one order because of this and just gave up since the main disk works OK.,1404691200,,122,4.3478260869565215
4665503,5,B005EIY0PO,I am an avid half marathon runner and now I definitely want to add this race to my bucket list.,1400025600,,95,3.8
4665504,4,B005EIY0PO,Since I'm running HTC in a couple of months this was very helpful in terms of planning.  Otherwise it's a fun special interest movie.,1399939200,,133,4.541666666666667
4665505,5,B005EIY0PO,What an excellent documentary! Made me wanna sign up to do it myself. Very enjoyable. Great for anyone who loves running.,1392422400,,121,4.809523809523809
4665506,5,B005EIY0PO,This was a well done and entertaining.  It was also a motivating film about an extrodinary race.  I wish there were more for each year.,1389398400,,135,4.36
4665507,5,B005EIY0PO,Runners and non-runners alike will love this movie. Good view into the craziest relay in the world. You'll watch over and over,1382572800,,126,4.7727272727272725
4665508,1,B005EIY0PO,"I love this film, but the disc was scratched and I never received a response to my complaint to the distribution company. Very disappointed with their customer service.

I would recommend this film to anyone who loves to run, who wants to understand the insanity of running, or who just wants to enjoy some Portland Weirdness.",1381017600,,326,4.821428571428571
4665509,4,B005EIY0PO,"Interesting peek into the race. I have heard about the race for many years, but the reality of how hard it is didn't hit me until I watched the movie.
 The perspectives from the three highlighted groups was fascinating",1379808000,,218,4.589743589743589
4665510,5,B005EIY0PO,This movie has inspired me to to be a part of H2C!!! I have friends on a team that have done H2C several times already and I am training to join their team for 2014. See you there!!!,1378512000,,182,3.8157894736842106
4665511,4,B005EIY0PO,Helpful to see the event unfold.  Still find the rookies accomplishment difficult to believe.  No training and they look like they just toughed it out,1376784000,,150,4.96
4665512,4,B005EIY0PO,"Great Movie. I've done the race, so it reflects the fun and the over-powering scope of a 200 mile race.  The tabs inside the dvd box were broken though, and the dvd's slide around in there. that's not great.",1374796800,,207,4.3076923076923075
4665513,5,B005EIY0PO,The product came in great condition.  I was amazed that it had no scratches.  My sister received it on her birthday and she was very happy.,1371945600,,139,4.3076923076923075
4665514,4,B005EIY0PO,Well done and enjoyable to watch  I felt there were a few gaps in time here and there but overall I enjoyed it.,1370131200,,111,3.8260869565217392
4665515,2,B005EIY0PO,This DVD was TOO Long. It did a poor job of letting me know who was who. I stopped watching it before it was over.,1368057600,,114,3.6
4665516,3,B005EIY0PO,We watched this after signing up for the Hood to Coast to get an idea what it's going to be like.  It's interesting but the documentary film making seems a little amateurish.,1366416000,,174,4.4375
4665517,3,B005EIY0PO,"I have to admit I don't understand all the five-star reviews of this movie.  On the positive side, it's a pleasant-enough sports documentary, and does an extremely good job of explaining how this really complicated event (which I've run 3 times FWIW) works.  So if you have never run Hood To Coast or another long-distance relay, this is an excellent movie to watch to get oriented.

However, as a piece of storytelling I found the movie lightweight and perhaps a bit resistant to challenging the audience with any negative information.  Like another reviewer said, the human interest angles are cliched; I have a feeling these people's real lives are more interesting than what's shown here.  The film is more like an incredibly well done human interest story on TV news than it is ""Hoop Dreams.""  The format, where individuals from 4 teams are followed, keeps interest bubbling, but prevents the film from showing any of the athletes struggling along the way -- which I presume they did.  After all, sports movies are about struggling, right?  If doing the event (whatever it is) is easy, then there's not really a story.

I think the audience would be more involved if there was a little more about how doing this race can be hard.  (Just one example: in the real race, the primary experience a runner has is being in the van, because that's where you are 90% of the time.  That van is home to a lot of b*t*hiness, confession, friendship, etc, -- it's the main place where things happen between people.  But the movie has almost none of it.)

That being said, one story (the heart attack lady) does manage to develop a little complexity, and for me that saved the movie from being merely a commercial for the event. :)

This movie is worth watching if you know what you're getting into.  But for better stories about running, I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Running-on-the-Sun/dp/B0000A02X7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Running on the Sun</a>, or any of the movies about Steve Prefontaine, for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Without-Limits/dp/B001R5CIGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Without Limits</a>.",1365465600,,2210,5.439882697947214

We are doing the Green Mountain Relay in June and none of the 12 of us have ever done 1 of these before. I recommended this film to my whole team so they can see this can be done and we can have fun!",1357862400,,281,3.7
4665522,5,B005EIY0PO,"I rented this movie because me and my team of 6 were preparing for our 200 mile relay race. Watching this movie helped us

4665523,4,B005EIY0PO,"I love all running documentaries.  This particular race is crazy and wonderful and I would love to have a go at it.  The film documents some really duder elite and aging athletes who, (although are the stars of the race and basically the founding fathers of the damn thing), make my wife cringe, reminding her of the fact that awesome women still have to ""run the gauntlet"" of mild sexual harassment even amidst a race, even if it's in the guise of fun and games.  Thankfully you get to follow a number of teams with different reasons for running and different skill levels.  There's no real cathartic climax or tale of redemption or ultimate success, which I find very intriguing.  It helps to solidify the notion that this race, as all races, is all in the running. The doing.  And the finish line is just the end of the journey, and not at all the goal, ya know?",1352592000,,865,4.443037974683544
4665524,5,B005EIY0PO,"I watched this movie because I like to run. It really didn't focus on winning the race or what people did to train, but mostly on the relationships between the members of the team and why they were running the race. It really made me want to run Hood to Coast, not from a competitive aspect, but because it looked like the teams had so much fun!",1352160000,,345,4.164179104477612
4665525,5,B005EIY0PO,"WOW!
I am a runner and 3X Ironman finisher and lover of all things endurance. This documentary, I feel, gave me the insight and up close view of what this race is probably like. It is funny (Dead Jocks in a box), poignant (They Bowe family/friends), and a little scary/creepy (Heart and Sole) teams. The Laiken team is very funny and one that I wish I could have been a part of.
The documentary takes you through the entire race and interviews the above teams from pre race to post and everything in between. No holds barred!

I can't wait to sign up for the lottery in 2013! Me 11 friends, 2 vans and lots of sweat!",1351209600,2,616,4.264957264957265
4665526,5,B005EIY0PO,"This was a great, fabulous, wonderful documentary. When a friend first recommended that I watch this movie, I thought no way, it's going to be so boring watching a bunch of runners. I'm more the type to actually be out there running rather than watching other people run. But within the first 10 minutes I was hooked, and by the time the movie was over I wanted to be out there on a team next year. I was so surprised on how much I loved this movie and how inspirational I found it. If you are a runner, or want to be a runner, watch this movie! You will love the people this documentary follows.",1349395200,,596,4.191304347826087
4665527,4,B005EIY0PO,Love running relays. Thought the explanation of what a long distance relay is and how it works (with their graphics) was AMAZEBALLS! I need to show this to my friends to convince them to run relays with me. Stories of those participating were pretty cute. Wished we would've seen more of the elite teams.,1348531200,,304,4.648148148148148
4665528,4,B005EIY0PO,"This movie was inspiring, funny and entertaining.  I'm a pretty competitive endurance runner and I loved it.  The group that drank beer to train was pretty funny, even though I can't relate to them.  I would highly recommend this movie all athletes and non-athletes.",1348272000,,266,5.0
4665529,5,B005EIY0PO,"Runners are going to ""get"" this movie and love it because they will recognize all their own motivations and compulsions in it. There's nothing overly technical about the subject matter or plot, so non-runners can certainly enjoy the film too. It's just that in my pre-running days I'm not sure I could have related to the woman who attempted Hood to Coast a year after collapsing on the course and undergoing CPR and multiple bypass surgery. Now I (sort of) understand. Running is so much a part of her life that without it life becomes anemic and watered-down. I loved the first-time relay team of non-runners, particularly the woman who had the epiphany after her first great run. We've all experienced that a-ha moment. And yes, I was brought to tears by the team running in honor of their son/brother/husband/friend who had died of a freak heart condition. It was a reminder of the immense pain people endure, pain that makes running a 196 mile relay seem like child's play. I appreciated the fact that the film barely mentioned the elite team that won the race. The emphasis of ""Hood to Coast"" was on the diversity of the competitors and the wealth of motivations that lead people to run.",1343260800,,1193,4.712918660287081
4665530,3,B005EIY0PO,"For those who have ever run a 200 mile team relay race this movie / documentary is great fun.
If you have never really experienced one then I think it will be one to avoid.

Bought for a present but have seen the movie as I have a copy myself.",1324598400,,243,3.86
4665531,3,B005EIY0PO,"For me, the video was OK, and it was an enjoyable view for sure. I think there are better running related movies out there and although this makes a nice addition to any runners' video collection, it is one for a rainy day. For me, it is not one that I will watch over and over - but one I can appreciate being a runner myself.

If you are from the area where this event takes place, or if you have ran the event, or if you have friends or family that have done this I think you will find this to be an immediate 5 Star and I would recommend this for you. It would be hard to be let down if you fall under this category.

If you have no connection or affiliation to the event, and want a video on running, consider looking at the following:

It is not a bad video. Look at the great reviews it has, many people love it, and I could easily enjoy the heartwarming stories, but all in all Hood to Coast was simply not one that I personally felt glued to.",1321747200,,1904,6.9957805907173
4665532,2,B005EIY0PO,"This DVD doesn't have much about the actual race, so if you're looking for top teams, race strategies, team logistics and tactics, or nutrition schedules, you can forget it.  This film is mostly about four very different teams, only one of which seems to be competitive.  Of the other three teams, two are featured to tug at your heart strings, which is becoming such a cliche in the first place and was seriously overdone in this film.  The final team is a bunch of Gen Xer's who are doing this more on a lark and less on real training.  Buy this DVD if you like the human interest stuff.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.",1320710400,,625,4.447368421052632
4665533,5,B005EIY0PO,This movie is about a race that involves teams of about 12 people; each running different parts of a course to get to the finish line. It follows a few teams and tells thier story and reasons for running this race. It is truly inspirational and is highly recommended if you are a runner.,1319414400,,287,4.333333333333333
4665534,5,B005EIY0PO,"I need to admit my bias, my husband ran as a Dead Jock (not one you see on camera much) and I love seeing the inside stories of Hood to Coast. The film covers a few runners from four teams through the grueling relay race.
I had heard so much over the years; the sweaty vans, the water guns, the sleepless nights, the coffin on the roof!  It was so much fun to see it.
The other three stories were touching, inspiring and plain funny!
The film does a great job of showing a BIT of the huge Hood to Coast story.
The music and graphics really add to the story.
Get it!",1316995200,,565,4.0
4665535,4,B005EIY0PO,"The Hood to Coast Relay is something that I had heard about for years in passing, but being from the east coast, the only relay near us worth competing in was the Blue Ridge Relay. The release of the Hood to Coast Movie has changed that and has truly propelled the relay to a worldwide destination event.

If you are unaware of the Hood to Coast Relay, in short, it is a 12-person, 197 mile relay that starts at Mt. Hood in Oregon, and ends in Seaside, OR (not the one where Jersey Shore is filmed). There are 36 legs, so each runner generally will run three legs each, with each leg spanning 3.5 to 7.8 miles. 1250 teams are allowed to compete and are started slowest to fastest (based on self reported 10k times). Each team is allowed two 12-person vans and must support themselves with food, etc.

In the fashion of ""Spirit of the Marathon,"" Hood to Coast's storyline is based on four teams competing. Team Heart N' Sole is based around Kathy Ryan, a competitor who was pronounced dead at the previous year's event and is on a quest to complete a marathon in every state. Dead Jocks in a Box are a group of aging Masters runners who have been doing the event for 25+ years and are still quite competitive. Team R.Bowe is a group of family and friends running in honor of Ryan Bowe, a guy about my age who died far too young of a heart condition. The final team was Thunder and Laikaning, which is a group of artsy beer drinkers, who enjoy life and just wanted to do the event for the challenge. These are probably a pretty good sample of the types of teams you would see competing at Hood to Coast each year.

All in all, it's fun to watch how the different groups navigate through the course and overcome their own personal demons (or lack there of). Personally, I would have liked to see the film focus a little more on the course, the race and it's history and the more competitive groups up front, but I realize that story wouldn't translate to the masses and the ""marathon craze"" that we've been experiencing over the past few years in America. The film does have some excellent shots of the breathtaking Pacific Northwest that will make any runner consider the event and does take about the wild expansion that started as eight teams who wondered if anyone would want to do it the following year. Runners of all ages and competitive divisions will find something to like about Hood to Coast, and if you're like me, you'll want to compete in the event after seeing the documentary.

For those of you interested in competing, the registration period for the 2012 Hood to Coast Relay opens October 12 (here's the entry form). And if you need another person to complete your team, email me!

Some extras that you will get with the DVD that you wouldn't see in the theatre are tons of deleted scenes, running tips, a ""Making of Hood to Coast"" piece and my favorite segment of any documentary DVD about groups of people; the ""Where are they now?"" featurette. Since this was filmed at Hood to Coast 2008, it's fun to see the changes in the lives of some of the members of the four teams that were followed three years ago.",1316908800,,3124,4.426086956521739

a must see.",1316736000,,288,4.72

After seeing it in theater, I couldn't wait to finally own a copy.  The first few seconds of the movie is one of my favorite parts.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but I will say this, ""WHOA!"".  Most of us have probably felt that way during a race at some point.  I am the road kill they speak of so frequently throughout the movie.",1315526400,5,464,4.1
4665542,5,B005EIY0PO,"This film is very well-made and reaches people from all ""runs"" of life: wannabe runners, once-was-a-runners, older runners, younger runners--I'm pretty sure even non-runners would enjoy this movie (but I can't speak for myself). It's very inspirational and just plain entertaining. If you like running at all, this movie is great! Even if you don't, it's still great (and maybe it's about time you become a runner! This movie will help you with that too...). Has great extras and good music as well. Whether you just want a weekend watch or something to inspire you in your running, this movie fits the bill!",1315440000,,608,4.912621359223301
4665543,5,B005EIY0PO,"I LOVE this movie!! This year the HTC celebrated it's 30th year, my husband Tim and I were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to run it this year for the first time. I was so nervous that I wouldn't be able to do it, until I watched this movie. It was inspiring. The teams that were picked for this were perfect! I actually was crying the first time I watched it (I was at home alone with our cat) and my husband thought I was nuts crying about a running movie. Well, after he watched the movie he felt a little different. The relay was one of best things that we have ever done. Being able to do it together made it even more memorable for us. Totally looking forward to doing it next year. Team Heart n Soul were amazing! I was lucky enough to be able to meet Kathy at the Safeway this year, and I got my picture with her. Those ladies assured me that if they could do it, I could do it!! We also loved Team Thunder and Liakaning (sp?). The theory ""If you can run 3 miles, you can run 10miles."" Is priceless. Whether you are a runner or not, this movie is for everyone!",1315440000,2,1077,4.084905660377358
4665544,5,B005EIY0PO,i've ran the Texas Independance Relay this year. This movie brings back all the memories plus some. Makes me want to run the hood to coast in the future. Although i hopefully i will not do it less than a week after a 50K like i did with the TIR.,1315440000,,245,3.92
8468368,5,B005EIY0PO,"A very nice documentary. I was in this relay race so it was even more fun to watch the ""behind-the-scenes"" making of the movie.",1511222400,,127,4.333333333333333
8468369,3,B005EIY0PO,"Hood to Coast is a good film basically laying out what the race is all about teams of 12 runners in 2 different vans who run 3 legs apiece starting from the top of Mount Hood Oregon down to the coast in Seaside Oregon.  Each leg varies in difficultly, and each leg is not all downhill, far from it.  Van 1 stage 5 set being the hardest and Van 2 stage 9 set.  Each leg has its own challenges and unique features making the different legs rewarding and a reason to do the next years race to do a different part of the race.

The film itself follows 4 different teams.  A team of former college athletes now reaching middle age Jocks In a Box.  Heart N Sole a team of senior ladies trying to redo the race after 1 of the teammates had a heart attack the previous year.  A team called Thunder and lightning non runner couch potatoes who enter the race and have no idea what they are in for.  And a team named R. Bowe who are dedicating the race to lost family member Ryan Bowe who died suddenly and prematurely.  Finally you get to see a few glimpses of the professional runners from the NIKE elite team Bowerman AC who usually win the race.

I thought the film was decent but not as good as Spirit of the Marathon and other running documentarys.  Make no mistake the marathon is a completely different animal than HTC and much more training and mileage is involved.  You can do a good job competing in the Hood To Coast race just by training for a half marathon and doing lots of hill work.

I would have liked the filmmakers to follow one of the elite teams as well and not just the newbie and senior teams.  You really don't see how difficult it is in the film to run on that packed gravel road uphill with vans driving past you kicking up dirt every few seconds in Van 2 legs 20 & 21.  I really wanted to know who the top mixed team was as well the best coed van.  You never do get to find out who won that bracket or the professional womens team.  Or the challenge to get your runner to the next exchange spot if there is a 2 mile long traffic jam of vans in front of you.

Now the high school kids also do Portland to Coast along with a ton of walking teams.  So it is deceiving seeing someone rocket past you who might not have had to do the full distance.  Also with all the walking teams it really slows down the momentum of the race.  It is hard to run your best when you are surrounded by walkers your brain is telling you stop, stop, stop but you want to finish strong it hurts your motivation seeing all these people walking instead of running.  Perhaps if the walkers wanted to do their own separate race I would be all for it, but not if it is supposed to be a competitive event.  Finally I would have liked to know who else was on the team that set the record with Alberto Salazar in 15 hours before the race became so popular.  Or maybe I was just expecting the movie to be an overall documentary on the history of the race.

Overall I would rate this movie 3 stars, the extras are nice on the 2nd disk but the film itself comes off as just average or good but nowhere near a great documentary about the relay race.  The film also doesnt show you the party and much of the finish and the results later the next day.",1504742400,,3229,4.110047846889952
