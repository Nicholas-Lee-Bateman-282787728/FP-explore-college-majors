8346833,2,B001VYX92A,"The visual aspect of this video is very good. Leon Jay is a gifted teacher and demonstrates the techniques in clear detail. However, the sound quality  is terrible! It is a live seminar, the dialog volume is extremely weak, and in many places during the demonstrations it is impossible to hear what he is saying. This is unfortunate because one cannot learn the small circle system without knowing which direction to apply pressure. While the techniques are demonstrated visually, many aspects of the small circle movements are imperceptable to the eye and must be explained in order to be understood. For a 40 minute video to be priced at $30.00 a person should receive a high-end product. This video does not make the grade, and as a result, I will be returning it in short order.",1313366400,,782,4.75
