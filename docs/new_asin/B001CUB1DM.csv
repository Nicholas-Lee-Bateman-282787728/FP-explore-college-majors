8289695,5,B001CUB1DM,"Great documentary on such brave young men. I know one of the ball turret gunners and he was only twenty years old when he
was a gunner. All of us should really consider where we were, what we were doing and what was are main concerns when we were twenty and think about what these men did for our country with no concern other than defeating the enemy. Wilbur is so humble and takes no credit for heroism or any other such talk he just did what needed to be done. If you can go to the CHINO AIRPORT in Chino California to the PLANES OF FAME and meet Wilbur and Carl Rossman (flight engineer/top turret gunner) they are both there every Sunday from 10 am till 4 pm sitting under the wing of the PICADILLY LILLY a B-17 that they are encouraging people to help restore by donations, t-shirts sales etc. Do yourself a favor and go and shake hands with these two men and talk to them and most importantly thank them for there service you'll be glad you did and it will put a smile on their faces.",1381536000,2,991,4.193717277486911
