727284,4,6303917178,"I've done the video twice now and I can actually say I've enjoyed getting back to aerobics (had a baby and no time for the gym now!).  The music is really fun (though different than I expected) and Donna's attitude just  keeps you going.
I felt a little spastic with some of the moves (been  away from the gym WAAAY to long) but after the second run through I think  I'll be moving right along on the next workout.  Maybe it was just me but  the queing could be a little better - - experienced aerobics folks  shouldn't have any problems though.
I'm looking forward to my next  workout, how often can you say that!  I'd say this is a great beginner or  intermediate workout that easy to adjust to your ability.",920332800,4,710,4.3106060606060606
727345,2,6303917178,"I didn't like the workout, Donna's teaching style and some of the music that was played in the background. She talks way too much. It only got my heart rate up very little. The workout was not fun at all!  Save your money and invest in Tamilee's Tighter Assets or her ""I want that"" series. It is a much better investment.",1095811200,3,321,4.262295081967213
727346,3,6303917178,"I think this video would be fun if: 1. Donna had a ""how to"" section at the beginning or end of the tape. The moves are complicated if you don't have a dance background, and just as you think you might be getting the hang of it, she changes the move. She never slows down to show you what she's doing, and she goes from move to move very quickly! I have to wonder how much the team had to practice before filming. 2. The camera would not costantly move to the exerciser's upper bodies. If it wasn't already hard enough, you can't see their feet! I found this tape a little frustrating, but maybe with a little more work I can get it, and it will be fun. She is a good instructor, though.",1065657600,8,686,4.088888888888889
727347,2,6303917178,"Walk, walk, forward, out out in, tap change, left tap change, how we doing, add the arms, here we go, four more times, heels first,left leg, knee up, from the top, take it side, right leg, here you go, go left, up, out, lift it up.  This is INSANE!  Donna Richard is an internationally acclaimed fitness professional, and she has soul, but she also has a BIG MOUTH!
This aerobic workout is a variation of energetic, happy people who have practiced the moves that lead you to believe you follow along.  First, camera angles focus on the faces, and other pertinent body parts.  You won't always ""see"" steps.  Second, there is way tooo much yakking going on!  Third, the steps are way too complicated, constantly moving.
When I do a workout, I want to focus on moves and not constantly trying to keep up. And, she yaks so much and so loud you can't even enjoy the music for momentum.
You can get a good aerobic workout, but I seriously doubt if anyone would want to repeat this jabberwacking video too often to get the moves right.
It isn't particularly high impact, and if you can't keep up, Donna guides you to watch a woman for low impact, but she doesn't show any difference at all.
I like music and I like dancing.  If I want to change to a million different moves, I'll dance to my own music in my own moves.  If this is your ONLY video to ever watch, do it;  if not, skip it!
The only good thing here is the ""Motown sounds.""",1048377600,6,1428,4.318352059925093
727348,4,6303917178,"This is a great tape for anyone looking for a low-impact all aerobic workout.  All the routines are done to the inspiring oldies but goodies music.  It took me 4 - 5 times to get all the routines down.  In typical Donna style, she is always inspiring and upbeat.  She obviously enjoys what she does and it shows.
This tape should be part of your basic collection.",1020211200,3,363,4.373134328358209
727349,3,6303917178,"I've done a lot of workout videos over time, and with very few exceptions I've been able to learn them within just a few tries.  Not this one.  I've gone through it about five times, and I still get so frustrated I want to kick the TV (which might burn off some calories, come to think of it).  The problems:
-- The camera work is awful.  It focuses on faces, not feet, far too often.  Moves change, and I have no idea what I should be doing because I'm watching someone's happy, singing face.
-- Donna does a move once or twice -- and then moves on to another move.  Later she'll come back to the first move, but I never did it often enough to remember it.  This is typical for dance, especially when you've got a while to get a routine down.  But it's frustrating when you just want a good workout in the morning before you go to work.
-- Donna uses the same terminology for different moves.  This adds to the confusion.
On the bright side:
-- Great music.  You can't beat the Motown hits for inspiration.
-- Donna's very perky, very supportive.  Not irritating.  I enjoyed her personality and found her motivating.
-- She provides a low-impact alternative to almost all the high-impact moves (although the woman doing the low-impact moves can't help herself at one point and does jump off the floor).
-- I would imagine that once you got the moves down, this would be a fun workout and one you could do often.  It remains to be seen whether I'll have the patience to keep tripping over myself long enough to finally learn the routines.
-- If you never do learn to do the steps on this tape, I suppose you can still boogie down to great music and get a good workout doing your own thing.",997660800,13,1689,4.3238095238095235
727350,4,6303917178,"I checked this video out of my local library so much I'm sure the tape will give out soon. It's so much fun that even though I intended to work out for 10 minutes the night I brought it home, I ended up doing the entire  53-minute workout.  Richardson is charming and her choreography would  move the dead. And I love the Motown songs this video is set to. If ever  there was such a thing as having fun working out, this is the closest I  have ever come. I'm buying the tape now because I'm sick of having to  surrender it to the library. I'm a big Denise Austin fan. I learned classic  moves from her and how to zero in on probelm areas. She has the best upper  body strengthing exercises around. But when you've mastered the classics  and you're ready for a good time, Donna's tape is the one.",955929600,11,795,4.177631578947368
727351,5,6303917178,"If you like Motown and you love to dance, this is for you. The first time I did it for the first time this morning and it was so much fun I couldn't believe it. I had a little trouble learning the routines, which is par for  the course for me because I'm kind of klutzy. However, I just kept moving  and I know that after I've done it a few times I'll get it down. Donna is a  very upbeat and encouraging instructor. If you don't like  ""dancey"" aerobics, or hate Motown, this isn't for you. Otherwise  it's the best workout I've ever done, and I highly recommend it.",953596800,15,566,4.109090909090909
727352,5,6303917178,This is a great intermediate video.  It's one of my favorites.  It's set to Motown music and it's very fun.  The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down.  I don't like videos  that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to  fast.  I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics.  IT'S  FUN!,947894400,2,373,4.214285714285714
727353,4,6303917178,I truly enjoy this tape and I began to feel the benefits almost immediately. I'm motivated to exercise because she makes it fun. The steps are challenging but it is extremely rewarding when you get the routines  down.,946944000,,217,4.7105263157894735
7855059,5,6303917178,Hey Donna!  Put this on DVD!  It is one of the greatest workouts ever!!! I just don't have a VHS machine anymore!  I can still hear the music in my head.  This would be a great come back DVD!,1454457600,,191,3.8205128205128207
7855060,5,6303917178,It came on time in perfect condition. Thank you so much.,1433462400,,56,4.181818181818182
7855061,3,6303917178,Lost a lot of weight using this video the past.,1424044800,,47,3.8
7855062,5,6303917178,"I've had this tape for years, and though it's a little too easy for me when I'm in shape, it's great when I'm re-starting after too much time off or when I just want to do something fun.  I have two left feet, but the choreography isn't very difficult for me, and I like that one of the participants is doing a low-impact version for the entire workout.  My favorite thing about this workout is the Motown music - it so hard to find an exercise workout with non-hiphop or non-salsa/Latin music, and I love Motown so the music is motivating for me.

I do hope it will come out on DVD at some point, as I will certainly buy another copy!",1332288000,,635,4.188524590163935
7855063,5,6303917178,"I love this workout video; I have had it for many years and still do it from time to time.  I don't think it's overly complicated, although it is ""aerobics"" so no, you will not be able to just mindlessly perform the moves without thinking at all.  If you are looking for that, you might want to try an athletic workout video.  As long as you can march or clap to music, you should be fine.  The music and moves are so much fun, and Donna has a great, motivating personality.  FUN!",1310083200,,480,4.173913043478261
7855064,5,6303917178,Love the motown music.  The tape was new. Got my heart rate elevated to my target zone. Low-cost shipping and handling.  Delivered in 2 business days.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1267833600,,175,5.407407407407407
7855065,5,6303917178,I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it.  I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.,1255824000,2,192,3.923076923076923
7855066,5,6303917178,"I have been using fitness videos to work out for almost 25 years.  Of all the workouts I've done, this is hands down the MOST FUN.  I like Donna Richardson and love Motown music, so this is a great combination for me.  I get to the end of the workout, and hardly realized that I was even working out.  I hope this workout gets put on DVD someday because soon I will wear out my old VHS tape.",1240272000,2,391,3.9743589743589745
7855067,5,6303917178,"What I really love about this video is the music -- it's Motown oldies and not a synthesized bland track, like most of the other exercise tapes.  It is a little challenging to learn  SOME of the moves, but you can reverse and try again! Also consider that you will have this tape a long time and you can keep practicing. Or just move to the music your own way, until the next song.

You don't need any weights, steps, or benches, but you do need a fair bit of space (maybe 8' by 10') to do this.",1146873600,,495,4.030612244897959
7855068,5,6303917178,"I give this five stars because when I first used the tape, even though it was challenging to learn the moves at first (but got it after the 2nd or 3rd time), I was having so much fun I found myself surpised when she said they were going to do a cooldown and I had actually sweated (wearing a sweat shirt)! This is intermediate because she moves fast even though it's low impact. I consider this to be at a steady and consistent space not an up and down (interval) heart rate like in the Firm (which I love).  It's a great non-impact, ""no equipment needed"" and fun workout to do on non-strenous days or in conjunction with strength training!  You'll learn some great dance steps in the process too!",1102896000,7,697,4.3538461538461535
