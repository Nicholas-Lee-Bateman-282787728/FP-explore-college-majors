This emphasizes weak acting and poor direction from Sutherland. Whitaker is OUTSTANDING in this early role for him.

The story does get better as you watch it, after you get through the steamy shower scene with the terrible ""sexy electric guitar"" music. *gag*",1198886400,,374,4.84375
525693,5,6302973945,"I usually don't like prison movies or Kiefer Sutherland movies (although I love him as Jack Bauer in 24), so I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was!  This is by far the best prison movie I've seen.  The acting was superb, especially from Sutherland who did an excellent job portraying the two sides of his character:  one moment a violent, vile, hard-core murderer who has committed horrendous crimes and would probably do it again if given a chance and the next moment a vulnerable condemned man who regrets his mistakes and would have lived a different life if he could, a man who is the victim of a bad childhood and a foster care/juvenile justice system that failed him.  Never has an actor done such a superb job of making me care about a character that my natural instincts were to hate.

I liked that this movie was able to make its point without being preachy or sappy.  It did it by telling a good story, with interesting characters and excellent acting.  It made me really think about my own views on the death penalty and what makes some people turn bad.  I can't say that it changed my views, but it made me think.  Most importantly, it makes me really want to DO something to help troubled youth BEFORE they get to the point of Sutherland's character.

Whether you want to be challenged to think or just want good entertainment, I'd recommend this movie highly.",1184112000,11,1389,4.542168674698795
525694,5,6302973945,"The theme of this movie is very real. Kiefer Sutherland's character represents so many young man that get lost in the jail system.

The movie really talks to you and makes you think.
Kiefer Sutherland did an amazing job directing this movie as well, the movie speaks to you in a very personal way.

Once you finish watching this film you will be touched, I know I was.",1183420800,2,368,4.397058823529412
525695,4,6302973945,"Kiefer Sutherland's performance allowed you to see the human side of a murderer and what contributed to the path he chose. All the characters were believable. No matter what your positon on the dealth penalty, it makes you think.",1176163200,8,229,4.897435897435898
525696,5,6302973945,This one kiefer also directed. again one of the many talents he has. THis one is a dark side movie. very strong performance by Kiefer.very dark life movie .one that fans don't get to see very offen from Kiefer. one  to watch .,1174262400,4,226,4.255813953488372
525697,5,6302973945,I saw this movie many years ago on Showtime.  I really liked it.  Kiefer is one of my favorite actors to date. I was doing queries on his films and came across this on DVD and had to buy it.  Thanks.,1171411200,2,199,3.8048780487804876
525698,5,6302973945,"This movie is outstanding in every single possible way. Forest Whitaker gives one of the best performances of his life and for Kiefer Sutherland I have only two words: pure genius.
Not watching ""Last Light"" means missing one of the greatest movies in history. No one who has seen it, will ever forget it. ""Dead Man Walking"" can't even touch this.",1048896000,9,346,4.688524590163935
525699,5,6302973945,This movie showed that Kiefer Sutherland is both an outstanding actor and a very talented director.  I can't believe there haven't been more requests for his exceptional work.,1005955200,7,175,5.25
525700,5,6302973945,"Last Light not only shows the remarkable acting talent of Kiefer Sutherland but also his outstanding ability to direct. Kiefer plays a remorseful prisoner on death row who is befriended by a death row prison guard. This is such a great movie and should be seen by everyone!!!!(Then again every movie that stars Kiefer is a great movie) If you like Kiefer's acting and
 directing in Last Light, try watching Truth or Consequences, N.M. which also stars him and is directed by him. It's a great one too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1002067200,13,518,4.886363636363637
525762,5,6302973945,"First off, what was this film's budget?  I can't imagine it was that grand given this was first a television film.  However, for whatever was spent to make it, the result dwarfs the expenses.  This is just a great film with the right amount of complexity in its plot and every character is cast just right.  It's a story we've all heard before...a man unjustly placed on Death Row and someone who begins to advicate for them despite the destain of the latter's peers.  Well, the differences here is that the condemned man actually commited the crime that landed him on Death Row, the crime was quite possibly provoked by prison guards (though the murder may not have been their ultimate intent), and the person doing the advicating is a prison guard, though his hiring occured after the murder in question.  Though these facts may not make a completely original story (aspects of it have existed in real-life controversies for many decades), the film's leading men, Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland, give a performance that humanizes both their characters, making this picture worthy to stand beside films such as ""Dead Man Walking"" and ""The Green Mile"".  It should have really been on the big screen.  Enjoy.",1395878400,2,1214,4.859223300970874
525763,3,6302973945,"It is an ""ok"" movie. Not Sutherland best. The Movie is  little low budget  and it is slow. The only way you will keep watching it is if you have nothing else to watch and you are a fan of the stars in it.",1395619200,,204,3.6136363636363638
525764,5,6302973945,A very moving and graphic account of what happens to children growing up in the prison system. This movie is the reason I sought a degree in criminal justice. It is beautifully well done.,1382832000,,187,4.529411764705882
525765,4,6302973945,"I saw this movie years ago. For some reason I never forgot it. I believe the story line was the catch,. This movie will make you mad, but at the end it will make you sad for Denver.",1377993600,,181,3.789473684210526
525766,5,6302973945,"I was amazed that I went from feeling ""yuckie"" about this character to feeling so much compassion for him. Total mind blowing!",1372204800,,126,4.7727272727272725
525767,5,6302973945,One of the best Kiefer Sutherland movies. He sure has a wide variety of roles. My wife and I were watching him way before 24. His roles are so diverse. His acting is excellent in this. Our VHS tape is in crappy condition - wish we had the DVD. Great movie.,1320192000,,256,4.03921568627451
525768,2,6302973945,"The story is simple. Guard on death row, meets man on death row, they both have their checkered pasts and hilarity ensues. At least, I thought so. This film was so full of eye rolling cliches that i could hardly stand to sit through the whole thing. I found myself laughing uncontrolably during some of the ""poor sad death row guy"" scenes just because of the things that they said or did were just so done. Same thing applies to the guard.
  I certainly understand and appreciate why kiefer sutherland would want to make this movie, and what he was trying to do and say but i think that there could have been so much more origonality injected into the whole thing. I had been really excited to see the movie but when all was said and done I came out of the experience really disappointed. I had high hopes and they were dashed. I guess that i might be able to blame it on my state of mind (extremely tired, slightly intoxicated) however i don't think that this movie would have been much better in a normal state of mind. At least while intoxicated I could find the cliches hilarious rather than really annoying.

all in all
E for Effor kiefer",1272931200,,1143,4.382075471698113
525769,3,6302973945,"This was a decent movie, though not Kiefer Sutherland's best.  My girlfriend and I decided to see it after getting hooked on 24.  If you want more Kiefer Sutherland, this is still a good movie to see.",1264896000,,200,4.378378378378378

525771,5,6302973945,"kiefer is very believable as denver in this movie (when is he not in a role he is playing). not the kind of movies i usually watch, but if you want to watch a movie that makes you think about it after you've seen it , this is one of those.it's not for the ones with a weak stomach, but it really makes you feel with both of the maincharacters (Forest Whitaker/Kiefer Sutherland).",1202428800,,379,4.205479452054795

7832739,5,6302973945,"Kiefer Sutherland has made a lot of movies most people have never heard of. Many of them are the kind of parts that young actors have to play in order to ""pay their dues."" And then there are the films that are absolute gems which have been ignored for one reason or another. This is one of the latter, probably ignored due to its uncensored look at the raw brutality of life on death row.

The story IS quite disturbing, and with lesser actors in the main roles, it would be unwatchable. And while Forest Whitaker is well known for his depth, which is quite evident here, IMHO Kiefer Sutherland is the shining star of this film (which he also directed.) He has a true talent for finding the humanity in the least of us. He can provide a path for us to follow to find the redeeming qualities of the most horrific and degenerate of human beings. Despite his enormous (and well deserved) success in 24, I think he might very well be one of the most overlooked talents in film today. His performance as Denver Bayliss is nothing short of genius. If you are a fan of Mr Sutherland's, but have hesitated to watch this film because of the subject matter, I recommend giving it a try.",1426982400,,1176,4.36986301369863
