3529331,5,B001DF681G,"This is the missing first season.  I looked for this a couple of years ago and could only find a used one on eBay, which I did not get.  This explains the beginning of the LEXX saga, and gives the following episodes the background to fully understand and appreciate the story line.  This is a 4 disc set, each disc contains a single 1 and 1/2 hour episode.  There didn't seem to be any extra features.  A must-have for any LEXX fan.",1233619200,,432,4.219512195121951

3529333,4,B001DF681G,"I've been waiting and hoping for years that they'd put these movies out on DVD in the US. I'm ordering mine now, but it doesn't bode well for this edition that the face of Xev (Xenia Seeberg) graces the box instead of that of Zev (Eva Habermann), since Xev doesn't show up until she replaces Zev in Season 2, and thus she doesn't appear in any of these season 1 movies!  Maybe it's so fans of season 2 onward won't be confused, but it just seems like an oversight. I hope it's the only glitch.",1223337600,19,493,4.189473684210526
3529334,5,B001DF681G,"This is not a TV season, but the 4 movies before it became a TV series.  Season 2 is the first TV show season.

For fans of the show, this is a must get.  It goes over the origin of the Lexx and all it's crew.  These 4 movies were not available in the US on DVD until now.  They were on VHS here, and Canada has had them on DVD and it is region 1 so you could have found a way to get them.

Lexx is my favorite sci-fi series as it does not follow the formula of sci-fi shows before it (or since for that matter).  You can easily get invested in these characters and their adventures.

The Four episodes/movies:

1.  I Worship His Shadow&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx-Series-One-1-0-I-Worship-His-Shadow/dp/B000065PG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx Series One ""1.0: I Worship His Shadow""</a>&nbsp;-  Things get started and you get a good idea of the characters and how things don't go the way you as a viewer expect them to go.

2.  Supernova&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx-Series-One-Episode-2-0-Super-Nova/dp/B000065PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx Series One (Episode 2.0 - ""Super Nova"")</a>&nbsp;-  They find a planet inhabited by Tim Curry, oddness ensues.

3.  Eating Pattern&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx-Series-One-Episode-Three-of-Four-3-0-Eating-Pattern/dp/B000QGZIXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx Series One - Episode Three of Four - 3.0 : Eating Pattern</a>&nbsp;-  Did I mention this was an odd series?  Rutger Hauer is in this installment where the Lexx has to land because it, the ship, is hungry.

4.  Giga Shadow&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lexx-Series-One-4-0-Giga-Shadow/dp/B000065PGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lexx Series One - 4.0 : Giga Shadow</a>&nbsp;-  Malcolm McDowell is in this final movie/episode of season 1 where the fate of the two galaxies is in danger.

Again, this is a must for fans.  If you want a different sort of sci-fi, then this series is worth giving an honest chance.  The production and pace gets better in the TV seasons, but this is a good start for newbies so that they can get the background on these characters, even if it is not the best example of the series.",1222992000,109,2313,6.003058103975535

I have been watching TV for 40 some odd years and I have watched every genre there is  from soaps to reality shows science-fiction all the Star Trek , Stargate, lost,  all of it and this was the most putrid thing I've ever witnessed in my life.

3529343,4,B001DF681G,The four movies comprising the first season of Lexx are entertaining and very different non-mainstream science fiction tales. Definitely not for everyone and a bit of an acquired taste in my opinion I would recommend these to fans of the genre who are not easily offended and don't want their sci-fi family safe and non-threatening.,1435536000,,332,5.054545454545455

It has absolutely terrible special effects, and you can tell in this first season, the site didn't have a very big budget, but the story line and feel of the show makes up for that, it's what makes it what it is! Definitely recommend to any sci-fi lover.

The cases and discs of this product are nothing special, and like previous comments and reviews, the discs are not labeled with a disc number or episode list. I stuffed that problem in 30 seconds with a quick google search and labeled the discs myself.",1430524800,,604,4.541284403669724

Lexx is weird, no question. It's an odd jewel of a space opera with lots of slapstick comedy and some pretty filthy humor thrown in. If you like campy budget scifi and have a twisted sense of humor, this is the show for you.",1429228800,,469,4.269662921348314

Saw this purely because I was looking for some sci-fi and this was available free w Amazon prime instant streaming. Really horrendous acting, beyond dumb storyline and effects mixing star-wars w conan the barbarian.
Can't think of a single redeeming thing about this show. Skip and watch star trek, babylon 5 or battlestar galactica...",1419206400,,544,4.849462365591398

3529371,5,B001DF681G,"By far, Season 1 is the best. The entire show is entertaining, but Season 1 also has a serious tone that is lost in the other three seasons.

These four movies have a very surreal, alien feel to them. Sure, it's a super-campy show, and the world has a lot of elements that are clearly from modern Earth (like Zev's wedding dress, or the number 4 on Stan's uniform). But the setting *feels* like another reality. The villainous emperor rules not a kingdom, not a planet, not a galaxy, but *the entire universe.* The dark, horrific world of tyrant, misery and gore encompass the *entire universe.* These characters don't just live in a dark world, they *exist* in one. Though I did enjoy the other seasons, I was very disappointed when they introduced Earth, taking away that surreal, alien aspect completely.

Another thing this first season does amazingly is give us a cast of characters that literally have *nothing.* Not material items, not friends or families, no pop culture, in some cases, not even a past. Certainly not morals. Things as simple as music are new novelties for some of them. It's common for lead characters to be ""blank slates,"" but the cast of ""Lexx"" are literally, intentionally blank slates. They spend the series discovering basic morals and ideas that we take for granted.

The other three seasons are good...but they're basically sequels. And all the ""sequelitis"" that comes with that.",1418169600,,1412,4.850622406639004

3529373,5,B001DF681G,"My only complaint is that they call this Season One. It is actually the first 4 movies that came before the actual series. Finally they are here in one collection. This show is great! It is real hardcore Sci-fi and not for the Sci-fi laymen. Great TV CGI effects for its time, lots of action, amazing characters, and a fantastic story-line all make this a must have for your collection.",1417737600,,386,4.5285714285714285

3529384,3,B001DF681G,"When I received this in the mail before I even opened the packaging envelope I could hear the disc sliding around freely.  Sure enough when I got the case open the disc was not in the center holder, the whole time it was being shipped the disc was sliding around freely within the case causing some pretty serious scratches on the disc.  Because of this I had to send it back, it would be nice to have an option to swap for a new set, except they only let you send it back for a refund and make you order it again.  Amazon should look into fixing that so all items can be swapped or refunded at the customers request for any damaged products received.

Upon viewing the actual disc it is a bare bones release with absolutely nothing but the first four movies.  No animated or music menus, no special features of any kind.  Just a main menu with a ""play all"" feature and a link to a sub menu with all of the episodes to click to watch individually.  There appear to be no subtitles or alternate languages available on the disc besides English, as well as no scene or chapter selection.  Which is fine because you can always use the skip ahead and back on your remote, the scene selection on discs is a bit unnecessary I've always found.

The main thing I am disappointed in with this release is that Echo Bridge the producers of this DVD decided to cram all 4 movies onto one single disc, rather then spread it out over at least 2 discs.  DVD Discs themselves are cheap to produce, and by forcing to fit all four 90 minute movies onto a single disc they obviously had to compress the video to make it fit and the video quality does suffer noticeably in some areas.  ""I Worship His Shadow"" and ""Supernova"" the first 2 movies should have been on one disc, ""Eating Pattern"" and ""Giga Shadow"" should have been on a second disc.  Squeezing 6 hours of video onto one disc is just lazy, cheap, and goes to show it was not very professionally done by an obviously amateurish and sub par DVD studio who cares nothing about the product they are putting out.

I give the dvd releases 3 stars because I'm not very satisfied with how the dvd was produced, but the show itself is excellent, I just wish they would have put some decent effort into making this before releasing it.  I mean just look at the box cover, why is Xenia Seeberg ""Xev"" on the box cover when she doesn't appear on the show until season 2?  It should have been Eva Haberman ""Zev"" instead if they wanted to show that character.  I'm not sure Echo Bridge even knows anything about Lexx.",1410307200,2,2541,4.329113924050633

3529386,5,B001DF681G,"I miss Lexx.  You have to be kind of quirky to enjoy this.  I also have Lexx soundtacks on cd.  As for the entire series, I enjoyed this show a long time ago because it was a good scifi drama.  It had darkness, comedy, adventure and kept me interested.  Of course there were a several episodes I could have skipped over.  The FX team created beautiful background scenes.

3529401,2,B001DF681G,"I saw in the reviews of Lexx that it got a fairly solid star rating.  Being a sci-fi fan I was up for trying it.  This is not your typical sci-fi.  It's not a Star Trek, Star Wars, Farscape, Babylon-5, Andromeda, Stargate or anything else with decent writing and characters.  Certainly if you want to round out your viewing of all things sci-fi then watch it, but be prepared to be bored.  Season 1 is four 2 hour episodes that give you the basis for the series.  It's too bad TNT didn't do this series so they could have screwed it up and shut it down after these first four episodes, just like they did with Crusade.  After the first season the rest go downhill which is saying quite a lot since it wouldn't have been difficult to do better.",1401148800,,743,4.264285714285714

Why some of these production outfits find writers that can't think - and then employ them - is beyond me.",1400025600,,399,4.577464788732394

Meandering.  What I mean by that is was it really required to make these shows so long and do the same thing over and over....and over...and over again?  Hey Stanley, lets have to whine and whine about whatever is going on while running generally in aimless circles.  Let's turn off the buzzsaw, no wait, let's turn it back on, no off, no on, no off.  No reason to only do it once or even twice to build the tension when we have 90 minutes to work with.  let's keep doing it over and over...and over...and over.

Next problem....why would anyone make a show with absolutely no one among the crew you could feel anything for?  Okay so Eva H. I could feel something for, but this wasn't supposed to be porn.  Kai was...whatever.  Go ahead and run out of proto blood already.  Don't even get me talking about Stanley or Gigarota or the insipid robot head or....it just goes on and on.
After the second episode, yes I watched two because I wanted to give the show a chance...I couldn't care less about any of the so called characters.
I will say this about that though.  If the intention was to over act, and alienate, those are some pretty fine actors.  Kirk at his finest could have taken lessons from these folks about how to draw out a scene to absurdity.

Sets, FX, anything vaguely related to drawing interest when the writing needed help?  Didn't happen.  If anything the sets looked like they were tossed together under the assumption we would accept nothing less than the least possible.  can probably generate better looking sets on my laptop right now and I am anything except accomplished.  I really can't say much about FX, mainly because I really can't recall seeing any FX.

What were you going for with the worse than juvenile incidences of....not even sure gross is the word I want?  Gross seems far to weak.  I got that Gigarota was gross, but we had to see just how gross over and over and....you get it.  Sure, you had all that time to use up, might as well reinforce the angle that G is gross, right?

The whole essence of the first two shows could have been narrowed down to a total of maybe 10 minutes.  2 minutes to establish Stanley as an idiot, another couple minutes to let us know Kai is dead and not dead, 2 minutes for Gigarota to be gross, 2 minutes to show us the Shadow dudes and the ship.  Let us look at Eva H. that whole time and you still have 2 minutes to spare.

This thing looks like it was stupid simply for stupid's sake.  It actually reminding me in some ways of Barbarella, except it droned on and on and on...and on and on.  At least Barbarella had the decency to only steal a coupe hours of your life.

Folks, I watched Sharknado a couple weeks ago.  Bad as that movie was, if forced to watch another episode of Lexx or Sharknado, I am going with a repeat of the movie.

Please, whoever dd this, never attempt sci fi again.  Or, if you do at least finish school first.

3529406,5,B001DF681G,"ATTENTION TO ALL SCI-FI FANS LOOKING FOR AN AMAZING SHOW: This is the ONE show where they don't spend 99% of the time talking inside a spaceship. On this one, we actually discover a wide-range of new, strange, bizarre and original worlds and locations. OH YES.

It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.

Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it.

You've got so many spots on the journey: they go to The Cluster, to Brunnis, to Pattern, then to Mantrid's Ice Planet, MedStat (space hospital), Luvliner (space brothel), TV World, the space jury, 791's industrial planet, Nook, Ruuma and then Woz, and that's only until season 2. Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets and its entire metaphysical plot about Heaven & Hell, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.

Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.

And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",1396483200,,2457,4.587699316628702

It's a joint Canadian/German Sci-Fi mix up, if that tells you anything.  When I first started rewatching it, it felt a little dated, what with the campy acting and low budget special effects.  I quickly got past that and started enjoying it just like I did when I watched it for the first time.
Pros
1) All four episodes are here in the uncensored US cut.
2) Kai is the man! Albeit the dead man...
3) It's a lot better than stuff you could be watching.
4) They fly around space in a giant freakin' bug that destroys planets!
5) Tim Curie

Cons:
1) Campy dialogue and special effects.  This will be a con for some.  I don't personally view it that way, as it adds to the charm.
2) The biggest con: all four episodes are on one disk.  This is not multi-disk.  The description lies!  This is the reason I only gave it four stars.

I was very excited to watch this when I found it on amazon.  Boy, was I let down.  Other than the universe (2 universes actually) and the basic idea behind the show, everything was lost in execution.  Acting / Writing / Effects - awful.

Lexx does have one redeeming quality.  Eva Habermann is super hot with her pink hair and short skirt.  But if you're not into hot chicks with pink hair and short skirts then you can probably take a pass on Lexx.

3529420,5,B001DF681G,"Let me begin by saying that this is not a ""real"" five stars.  I would not give the same five stars to The Sopranos, for example.  This rating is based on my expectations of this show.
Lexx is fairly typical of Canadian shows: very campy in every way plus a bit of sex.  Being a Canadian myself, I have been exposed to a dreadful amount of Canadian-made shows but, happily, this one is A-OK!
I am a Sci-Fi fan, but I enjoyed this show more than Firefly.  Despite Lexx's usual Sci-Fi sexism (which believe me, guys, is in practically every series), the show did not seem as ""creepy-sweaty-nerd"" about it as usual (as Joss Whedon's work ALWAYS comes across). Unfortunately, I can't offer any more clarification - it just didn't rub me the wrong way - is all.
The dialogue isn't world class, but it is fine for what it is.  It isn't at all ""quippy"" which was refreshing.
The show is very silly. And very campy. And doesn't take itself as seriously as other shows: it's a bit cheeky.
Lexx manages to resonate emotionally despite the paucity of what some may call professionalism.  This ""lack of professionalism"" or ""camp"" is what most Canadian shows deliver and should therefore not be overly surprising to the viewer.
Unlike Battlestar Galactica and it's maddeningly false ""they have a plan"" claim, Lexx is honest about what you'll get: it is camp all the way through.  There is no false promise of things to come that do not pan out.
Essentially, this show is not American TV: if you are looking for something with a more streamlined presentation, look elsewhere.

I watched all four 90 minute episodes hoping it was going to get better. It never did. I think a behind the scenes look at this show would probably be far more interesting than the show itself. A huge number of people worked on it. A lot of time, effort and money was invested. How on earth did the final product end up resembling an amateur theater production?

Most contemporary science fictions shows suffered from a lack of environments. Lexx tried to include many locations and many sets. However most were wobbly and composed mostly of colored fabric stretched over frames. There's a lot of sets but they all look cheap and nasty.

The back story showed promise. The insect based technology was interesting. The grim society and terrible injustice could have provided a wonderful setting in which the show could unfold. Unfortunately the story itself is shallow and cliche ridden.

The acting. Oh the acting. Most of the performances are wooden at best. Perhaps the actors were embarrassed by the childish dialog they were given? I've got to single out Eva Habermann here. How on earth did she land the role? Obviously she is extraordinarily pretty, but her performance across all four episodes is woeful.

If you have grown tired of the monotony of what Sci-Fi shows like Star Trek have to offer, give Lexx a shot. Season one is short, but really sets the stage for the next three seasons. Each season has an interesting overarching theme from one to the next. This makes you ask, 'Why more shows can't do this?'.

Each main character has qualities that cause internal strife, that seem like paradoxes and often get in the way with others on the crew and prevents them from working together for a common goal. Although, they often do work together only when they realize what is going on. It is an excellent look at how individuals often get stuck in their selfish ways, even sexual desires, and can't break habits for the greater good.

Anyone ever see ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century""??  They obviously spent a fair amount of money on production and effects but a roomful of 6th graders could have done better. I can only assume that veteran actor Barry Bostwick must have had serious financial problems to do this pilot. The shiny metal short kilt he wore was just embarrassing and even he could not breath life back into the lifeless script. Did he loose a bet?

So the broad strokes of the plot (to the extent there was one) was mix One disgruntled worker, fool and general screwup who failed at everything in this big brother world and ""oh by the way he was secretly one of only two great freedom fighters with special skills??"" Barry Bostwick being the other who, luckily for Barry, dies in the pilot. Then add One hardcore bad guy with a bee hive hairdo who is ""kind of dead?"" And changes sides in the pilot from evil rulers #1 hit man to good guy fighting against the ruler, but since he's dead'ish they lock him away in a futuristic coffin where he informs them that they should only bring him out when they really need him (Lexx version of Hulk turning green and ripping his clothes??) and One woman who was designed to be as undesirable as possible who's crime was ""not pleasing her husband"", her punishment was to be turned into a pleasure slave and given to a religious cast as personal play toy so they stick the ugly woman into the plastic surgery EZ Bake Oven and out pops Eva Habermann ..... As if they had such a device the little brat or his over indulgent parents would not have changed her themselves?? So these people somehow manage to walk onto the evil dictators mega bad A$$ super destructo ship, the biggest and most powerful ship in the universe, which I think they were trying to make look like a cross between a dragon fly with a scorpions tail but ends up looking like a giant flying penis. (No that's not a typo) so disgruntled fool and mega hottie with coffin killer guy fly around by themselves in this largest of ships with no crew in an alternate universe running from evil dictator dude.

I can see only Two positive attributes to the pilot episode. (1) the female lead Eva Habermann, is certainly a visual feast (at least for the male viewers) and she managed to breath some life into the dead script. I felt sorry for her when I read her bio that said her time in this series was what she was best known for. (2) the pilot episode was a free download.

One of the main characters was a dumpy woman who dared stand up to her new husband's tiring sexual whims, and was turned into a beautiful sex slave as punishment. She's also part raging carnivorous alien worm, another mishap of the transformation. Unfortunately, her attitude adjustment, which was to make her do anything for that one person was placed into a robot head who now spends all his disembodied existence pining after her. The main character himself, Stanley Tweedle, is a hapless has-been security guard who steals the Lexx and spends all his time trying to seduce the lovely dumpy-wife-turned-sex-slave. Add in an assassin, last of his now-extinct race, and you have a thoroughly screwed up cast.

I wonder if the Acorn or Salter Street versions are better. The Salter Street DVDs are very expensive. I read the Alliance shut them down, so their DVDs may be out of print.

3529473,3,B001DF681G,"I happened upon this DVD on a deep discount and it looked interesting so I gave it a try. It's kind of hard to nail down exactly how to explain it, but I'd call this more of the love child of Red Dwarf and Farscape. Very heavy on the red dwarf level special-effects and major dopey character, with the whole living ship and going to different planets bit from Farscape.

The special effects are grade B at best. You can tell they tried to make do with what they had, and did a reasonably good job of the considering everything, but everything down to the sets is obviously cheaply made when compared to a show like Farscape, Star Trek the next generation, the latest Battle Star Galactica, etc. that have set the bar reasonably high. Whoever did the casting for the show, in my opinion made some major mistakes. The character Zev just had to be a hot chick, and quite frankly is, to make her character work. Most of the time she's just pining over the assassin guy and looking good in an incredibly sexy little short skirt that from time to time flashes some panty. The second movie also has a brief bit of footage with her topless in the shower. It's something that might keep you somewhat interested, but she's not a good enough reason to buy the series.

The other characters are rather useless lovestruck robot head which never says anything funny, the ship which is more or less monotone voice and doesn't have much opportunity to have range, the captain, and the assassin. There's not much to say about the head or the ship, the casting on the captain seems all wrong. He's supposed to be dopey, which he is, but something just doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm just too used to Arnold Rimmer being perfect prat, but this guy just didn't work for me. The assassin guy would've been okay, but they have to do something about his giant hair. It's like a woman with a beehive hair cut attacking someone.

Despite these problems, the set was actually pretty enjoyable. There are bits especially in the first movie that had me laughing heartily out loud. I won't spoil things too much, but let's just say little kids don't get their awards. The second movie, the one with topless Zev, was a little pointless but enjoyable. The third movie was mostly inexplicable. The fourth movie was enjoyable assuming you suspend disbelief entirely. Not a bad set of movies, but not worth much more than the few bucks I paid for them.  They'd be best as cable/broadcast movies run on a weekend afternoon.",1338163200,,2487,4.557046979865772
3529474,3,B001DF681G,"You hear it over and over- Lexx is weird, odd, strange, unique, bizarre and so on.  The truth of the matter is even with multiple years of this knowledge via reading reviews of this fashion; I still don't think I was equipped to realize just how odd the show actually is.

I'm an admitted scifi nut.  I've done just about every space-themed series and movie ever to grace the planet (yes even the low-key ones, ever hear of Trapped in Space, StarKnight, In the Fold, or Treasure Island in Outer Space?).  I am usually more interested in long running serials like Farscape or the new Battlestar Galactica for my coin as they provide much more entertainment value than a single feature film.

Enter Lexx.  Anyone who has shopped for Farscape, Serenity, Stargate or the like has surely been recommended this show by Amazon's occasionally helpful bots.  It went four seasons, enjoys nice affordable box set releases and has a premise that any scifi-head should appreciate: A living ship with an insatiable appetite, a ragtag crew of criminals, interstellar travel, an oppressive intergalactic government, alien life forms, and a bit of dark humor.  Okay a dark humor overdose!

Anyway, as countless others have stated, Season 1 is in fact the first four 90-minute films dating back to 1997 on Showtime that inspired the launch of the weekly series that would follow.  After having just watched the show there is but one solid conclusion: This is WEIRD!

Beyond all the surface stuff (after all, science fiction is known for pushing boundaries to what we perceive as possible), the show is just one of those spectacles you sort of have to see to understand.  The computer-generated effects work is solid and the acting works a lot better than one would expect given the premise but the pacing is all over the place (from fairly coherent to downright dragging at times) and the humor is either absolute brilliance or complete and utter madness (thin in the line here).

You get some pretty intense gore, a little welcomed female nudity and some pretty solid concepts (two known universes: a light & dark counterpart, a dead assassin reanimated with proto-blood, a formerly evil robot's head that had undergone sex slave treatment and so on).

Believe it or not, such things aren't even the oddities! We have a cannibal woman in an outfit made of skin, a room full of talking brains that belonged to previous Divine Shadow bodies, a ship that speaks English and narrates the show's openings, a hormone-driven robot head, talking super nova and on and on.  Sometimes the only logical conclusion to the show's creation is drug use, lack of sleep or some combination of the two.

However, this isn't to say the show fails either.  You just have to go into it with certain expectations.  If you're looking for an alternative to say Star Trek or Farscape, you should probably pass over this one.  However if you're looking for science fiction that never takes itself too seriously and is laced with dark humor and sheer strangeness, you have found your masterpiece.  After having done the first four films, I personally will not be going on to buy the three boxes comprising the TV series but that's not to say I didn't appreciate what the show attempts.",1336435200,,3242,4.817689530685921

3529480,5,B001DF681G,"If you've read reviews on this show already, you'll notice a theme running through all the reviews...the show's weird.  Very weird!

The show is about a security guard that made a mistake and, to avoid punishment, takes off.  That's it.  Now, this show takes place on a spacecraft that is alive with a crew of the security guard, a sex slave and a dead guy and, during the entire series, they never get to one good planet.  By the way, the ship also has the most powerful weapon in the two universes.  The entire series is the crew searching for a decent planet to visit and, possibly, stay...if the entities out to get them don't find them.

To me, this is my all time favorite sci-fi series because it is so different and just doesn't stick to a any formula.  The movies (season 1) are different than season 2 and season 2 is different than season 3, etc.  In essence, the show is a comedy.  All of the characters are bad and are various versions of the wicked witch of the west.  Selfishness, lust and lack of character are pretty much the standard traits all have in common with the only exception being the dead guy...and even the dead guy comes with baggage...he was an assassin prior to his demise.

3529482,3,B001DF681G,"At first blush (literally), ""Lexx"" is about sex. After all, one of the main characters is a love slave, and judging by her attitude and dress, she's taking her new job pretty seriously. However, ""Lexx"" is so much more -- it's science fiction with some balls (metaphorically speaking).

It starts with these four German/Canadian movies, sometimes collectively referred to as ""Tales from a Parallel Universe."" (Also the name of the soundtrack album for these films.) The Lexx is a huge dragon-fly living ship with a planet-busting weapon. In the midst of pursuit and mayhem, a lowly, cowardly, self-interested security guard (4th class) -- one Stanley Tweedle-- inherits the ""Key"" to Lexx, becoming his/its captain. He is reluctantly joined by Zev (Eva Haberman, not Xenia Seberg pictured on the cover) -- a newly-created love slave, sentenced to become such for ""not performing her wifely duties"" and accidentally mixed with cluster lizard DNA.
Rounding out the core crew are the sarcastic, but very smitten robot head 790, and eventually Kai, formerly a Brunnen Gi warrior, and now (2000 years after his death) a recreated dead-alive (alive-dead?) assassin serving the ""Shadow,"" the current ruler of this part of the ""Light Universe"" and the main adversary for these stories.

These four movies are very dark comedy/drama, a cross between the dour 1970s SF dystopias (themes of cannibalism, dismemberment, and recycling of the ""parts"") and SF/fantasy adventure. There's commentary / satire on sex, love, marriage, family, society, religion, political control (lots of Orwellian vibes), drugs, and power -- of the government leaders and the individual. The visuals are good and the character dynamics are pretty strong. Some plotlines work better than others, but it's generally good. The scores are a mishmash of electronica/rock, modern dramatic scoring, and some other styles, much of it fun good catchy material. Three movies have stunt casting (!), although other guest characters tend to be more interesting.

The series itself would lighten up slightly from these dark -almost morbid- but still good and engaging adventures.

I really loved Eva Habermann and was so disappointed she left the show after the first 4 episodes. Overall though its a tough show to explain because its not at all like other sci-fi shows. Basically Xev is the beauty, Kai the muscle (along with Lexx ship which is alive) and Stanley is the brains, except he's an idiot. And Kai is dead most of the time - he uses a special blood to re-animate himself. Then there's this robot head that loves Xev and hates Stanley, and cracks jokes.

3529487,5,B001DF681G,"Well as one of those people who think Lexx is great let me explain my point of view.

Firstly, don't watch Lexx so seriously. It's meant to be raunchy and stupid. That's what makes it great. You get attached to the characters and can connect with them, especially Stan since he's the one most like an average person.

I have my quips about Lexx as well. Sometimes the whole show feels like its a big orgy waiting to happen. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED on how I really hate Kai's hair.

However, despite its flaws, Lexx is truly unique in it's own way. For one, The ship is a living breathing eating organism instead of the sterile mechanical behemoths that we are accustomed to seeing in traditional Sci-Fi. The heroes of the story are the worst people to pick to save the universe [i.e. the arch traitor anti-hero, Love slave with a selfish agenda, Dead assassin with no real feeling or thought, and the one track mind of a perverted robot head], but you'll find yourself cheering for them to succeed as you make it though the series.

Lexx may not be your Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, FarScape, Firefly, etc. Yet what it lacks from those ""cookie-cutter"" sci-fi shows, it makes up for in absurdity, inventiveness, and simplicity. Like I said, You shouldn't be looking for the meaning of life in the plot of Lexx.

This editing must have meant that the music in Giga Shadow was out of sync, but rather then re-score it they have compressed it and then muted the sections that sound too atrocious. I Worship his Shadow also has substantial over dubbing of dialogue throughout the episode (the most annoying of which is the bug bomb sequence) that, in my view, distracts from the overall atmosphere.  So content wise, this is definitely a d grade release.

From a video quality stand point the picture is about as good as you'd expect from 90s TV without any additional work so it won't look brilliant if you've got a 40"" HDTV, but to be fair that is understandably.  The audio is also acceptable with exception of the music on Giga Shadow, and is Dolby 2.0 at 192kbps.

As such, those that have seen the full length uncensored version of Lexx will only be disappointed from this set, but unfortunately this is likely the only set you'll probably be able to buy new.",1284854400,80,1559,4.647272727272727
3529492,5,B001DF681G,"Lexx is in the class of Dr. Who, in being a very imaginative far future SF series.  Unfortunately lasted only 4 seasons.  For me season 1 was best, starting with a stunning series opener.  Also because the lead actress left the show after the first season, and I preferred the original German actress to the later English replacement.  I never saw the original DVDs for sale in my area, otherwise I would have bought the whole thing as it came out.  So more recently, piecemeal, I have purchased all the DVDS, mostly used, because of high cost.  I am glad to have the whole series now.  Very imaginative, high production value, some very interesting effects, a Canadian-German co-production.

3529495,4,B001DF681G,"The packaging is incredibly frustrating!

To my shock the item I just paid top dollar for arrived without shrink wrap and to make matters worse it contained two extremely tight transparent stickers attached around both sides of the slipcase which I presume were intended to keep the digipak from falling out (why was this necessary when shrink wrap would have held it in just fine?).

Once I manually moved the stickers from the foil slipcase I was irritated to discover the stickers left permanent residue and tore through the foil, I did my best to remove it using a cloth but by the time I finished I had a nice big white streak along the spine of the digipak.

Packaging issues aside the transfer is excellent and the content is uncensored unlike the R4 Australian release, so based on this fact alone the Echo Bridge Entertainment version is currently the best available edition in print.

3529501,4,B001DF681G,"(""Lexx"" was also called ""Tales From a Parallel Universe"", depending on where and when one saw the original run.
The Big Four are also referred to as Lexx 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0,  The TV series are numbered as 2.x, 3,x and 4.x with each ep assigned a number (x) for that seasons' episode.)

When it comes to ""Lexx"" you either love it, hate it or simply just can't comprehend it.  But you should give it a try.

The ""Big Four"" DVDs are sort of the ""Holy Grail"" for Lexx fans and me, being one of them, have been waiting for a reasonably priced set of the four original movies.

1.0 ""I Worship His Shadow"" introduces us to Kai, Last of the Brunnen G and the cosmology for ""Lexx.""
The ""Light Universe"" is ruled by an extremist, totalitarian theocracy called The Divine Order.
Great opening battle scene and fantastic ships and weaponry wipe out all life on Brunnis II.  We see how Zev gets transformed into a love slave, how 790 gets transformed and how Stanley fumbles his way into to becoming the Captain of the Lexx and how they all come together as the crew. We also get Barry Bostwick as Thodin, a rebel leader in the fight against ""The Divine Order"" and Ellen Dubin as ""Giggerota.""  The crew escapes into a black hole with His Divine Shadow's flagship right behind them, trying to retrieve the Divine Predecessors that the Divine Shadow had stored there.

2.0 ""Super Nova"" (my favorite of the ""Big Four"") takes us to Brunnis, the original home of the Brunnen G.  The planet is still intact and the sun is too: the satellites that kept the Sun from going Nova still work.  The planet is devoid of life as everyone leaves for Brunnis II because the sun is dying.  Well, almost everyone.  A single inhabitant, Poet Man, (Tim Curry) spent many years hacking Brunnis' technology as his revenge for being (intentionally?) left behind.

3.0 ""Eating Pattern"" finds our crew starving when a radio beacon finds them and invites ""fresh"" people to visit the secondary resource (read junkyard) planet, Klaagya.  Desperate, the crew make their way to the dump and find that they are what's for dinner..sort of.  The creatures inhabit the bodies of the planet's former inhabitants and must eat ""Pattern"" which is processed from human bodies, but because of a sort of cannibalization, the pattern they now make is ""less than premium.""
Bog, played by Rutger Hauer, is the ""King of Pattern.""  We also meet ""Wist"" who is their leader.

4.0 ""Gigashadow"" With His Divine Shadow and the Divine Predecessors feared destroyed, we find the The Cluster and Divine Order disintegrating. Remnants of the priesthood are trying to restore The Order and His Divine Shadow by creating the Gigashadow. But one of the high priests named Yottskry, played by Malcolm McDowell, has reservations.  A junta by the rebel priests tries to take power and Yottskry dies during the struggle.  He is later unintentionally revived by a protoblood leak and he gets incorporated into the Gigashadow as it's nexus.  The crew of the Lexx go back to the cluster to get more protoblood for Kai and discover what is taking place.

A bit about the TV series...

I kind of take issue with Farscape fans who say that the idea of a living ship (The Lexx) was stolen from Farscape (FS), but the idea wasn't new.  Lexx aired before the first ep of FS and Star Trek and Robert Heinlein had living ships in their stories.

There is a bit of a history between Lexx and Farscape fans.  Fans sometimes blamed each others show as being inferior or the respective shows of ""stealing audience"" and even of not bringing in enough viewers as a lead in or lead out to the next tv hour...and later FS fans blamed the lack of support from Lexx fans helped in the cancellation of FS.  To me, the biggest difference between the two shows were budget, support by scifi (now called SyFy) and the objectives of the respective show's' crews.  While FS flew around saving planets, alliances and galaxies, the Lexx crew were looking for food, a home and ""fun.""",1271203200,16,3981,4.641940085592012
3529502,1,B001DF681G,"I read other reviews on Lexx comparing it to Farscape and was excited to see this series.  Unfortunately the only thing vaguely resembling Farscape was the fact that the spacecraft is alive.  The characters are weak, the acting is comparable to a Saturday Morning Kids show.  The special effects do have their moments, the space scenes where Lexx is cruising around are good, and the bug transporters are pretty good but mostly the CGI is old and dated.

I watched each of the 4 DVDs hoping it would be better than the one before, unfortunately they are all boring and stupid.  The captain of the ship is so stupid when he was onscreen I was tempted to hit the mute button.  Halfway through every episode all I could think of was when will this torture be over. I gave the set 1 star because there was no zero stars.",1267920000,11,816,4.442953020134228

I had to take one star away for the menu at the front, I would have thought they would have put more work into that.  But still, I felt that the product itself comes nicely packaged and the video is crisp and clean. If you have never seen Lexx, start with this set!  It's cheesy, goofy, bizarre, imaginative, weird, fantastic, and just a great romp! It has one shower scene where you see Zev in the buff (slightly - too bad it's so slightly) but other than that it's pretty much PG except for the over outrageous unbelievable violence.  Like the older Doctor Who's, the cheesy special effects just add to the overall wonderful flavor!

3529506,4,B001DF681G,"I was very excited when I heard that Lexx, Season 1 was finally being re-released.  Finally, a way to get all 4 movies for a reasonable price.

As any fan of Lexx will tell you, this is not your ordinary Sci-Fi show.  It features quirky characters in an odd universe that drips with very thinly veiled erotic themes.  This is not a show for children, but for adults who can understand its mature themes.

Each movie comes on it's own disc, so there are 4 discs in total.  The insert unvolds to reveal 2 discs on each side, with one disc overlapping the other, making it impossible to remove the lower disc without first removing the upper disc.  This is a bit of a pain, and I would have preferred an individual thinpack for each disc.

Additionally, each movie is presented in ""Fullscreen"" 1.33:1 ratio rather than Widescreen 2.35:1.  It seems odd, given the populary of the Widescreen ratio, that they would choose to release this in Fullscreen instead.

Finally, the menu screens are very basic, with the only option beyond ""Play"" being the Chapter selection.  However, there isn't one single extra feature on any of the DVDs.  No deleted scenes, no cast interviews, and no commentaries.  Not even a TV spot or stills from production.  Absolutely nothing beyond the movies themselves.

Still, this is a great show that I would recommend to anyone looking for something different.  The show itself deserves a 5/5 rating, but this set deserves a 3/5 at best.  Part of me wonders if they'll come out with a better set in a few years, but I suppose that's the nature of these things.",1252713600,4,1582,4.633093525179856

3529510,5,B001DF681G,"I give these four movies 5 stars, they are the beginning of one of my favorite TV shows.

I want to give you some insight into the difference between this release (Echo Bridge) and the original canadian release by Salter Street. The Salter Street releases were four separate movies in individual cases, while this release is packaged in a kind of ""book"" style. The disc's carrier slides out of the cardboard sleeve, which has some nice embossed features of the graphics. It carries, as someone already noticed the image of Xenia Seeberg (Xev), who replaced Eva Habermann (Zev) a few episodes into season two...

The carrier itself opens up and holds two discs on each side. Overall, the package is only slightly thicker than a single DVD case. To note is that the slider is sealed with some non-removable tape. It needs to be cut and can not be peeled off without damaging the box.

The 4 movies are ""bare bones"", none of the extra features of the canadian release are included here. These were an interview with creator Lex Gigeroff, a behind the scenes featurette, and some panels with information about the characters, for each of the four movies. Those are interesting for hard core fans, but not necessary to enjoy the show.

Also, the separation into chapers of each episode is different. The Salter Street release had 9 chapter marks per episode, while this Echo Bridge release has 10 each, at slightly different points in the story. The video quality of the episodes, as far as I can tell, is identical.

Other than the missing extras, this release is, in my view, recommended.",1243987200,51,1585,4.749090909090909

8293183,5,B001DF681G,"Lexx was a weird TV show. And I loved it. The only show that even came close to the weirdness on display in Lexx was Farscape, also a four season sci-fi show. There is nudity in Lexx, but not in Farscape. The first actress playing the Zev character, Eva Habermann shows her breasts. The second actress playing the Zev character, Xenia Seeberg, from season two to four, doesnt. Other women are shown nude, but not Seeberg. Her character teases the Stanley Tweedle character for three seasons, but never gives the poor guy any relief. Bad Zev.

The best character is Kai, played by Michael McManus. Jeffrey Hirschfield and Tom Gallant also do outstanding work voicing the fourth and fifth characters, 790 and Lexx, respectively, and many other fine actors and actresses appear, including Rutger Hauer playing an absolute evil dweeb character.

Most sci-fi shows don't contain any nudity. Exceptions are, the pilot of Stargate SG1, Odyssey 5, some episodes of the second Outer Limits series from the nineties, Westworld, etc. Theres plenty of good stuff out there if you want to avoid nudity, but youll be missing out on some great sci-fi.
