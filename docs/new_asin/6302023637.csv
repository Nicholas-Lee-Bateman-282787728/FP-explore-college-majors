409246,5,6302023637,"This was Dominick Dunne's offering to the world before he cleaned up his substance abuse problem (he admits to this). I, for one, am glad he was still ""doin' his thang"" while he produced it, because its bizarre emphasis on the power--and surgical gore--of the facelift would have been lost otherwise. The film has a voyeuristic, look-at-that-car-crash-honey quality to it, and Liz ""before"" the facelift is a hoot to see. Deeeeelish!",1003449600,7,432,5.098591549295775
409247,5,6302023637,"Gay men have treasured this unabashed tribute to the once phenomenal beauty of la Liz since ""Ash Wednesday"" came out in l973. Some day, the rest of the world will appreciate this movie as Liz's last glamour movie and a chance at last to act with somebody besides that hambone scene-eater Richard Burton who she demanded co-star with her in one disaster after another. Filmed on location in Italy's famed Cortina ski resort, you've never seen the 41-year-old Taylor look as spell-binding as she does here. An Oscar should have gone to her personal make-up artist, Albert De Rossi, for creating her stunning make-up; to Alexandre of Paris for her classic hair-styles; to Edith Head for whipping up the fabulous furs, velvet gowns, robes worn by the star; and especially to French couturier,Valentino for the knock-out white turban and ermine lined ensemble worn by Liz to the resort's mardi gras ball. Producer Dominic Dunne wrote in his memoirs that more drama occurred behind the camera than on. Liz was breaking up with Burton. Dunne says she was drinking heavily, over-dosed, relentlessly late, was rushed to the hospital for a mysterious condition, had operatic confrontations with her promiscuous spouse and Burton accused her of having an affair with her hunky on-screen lover, Helmet Berger, which caused everyone to laugh. Berger was the lover of Italian director Luscino Visconti. Incredibly, none of this tumult appears on film. Cameraman Ennio Guaninieri bathed Taylor in beautiful light and shadows. Before Taylor resumed making her string of disasters where she shrieked like a harridan, looked hideous in funhouse clothes and huge hair of the 70s, we can all watch Ash Wednesday and drool over this dark little fantasy about a woman who has her entire body lifted--just to impress her cold-fish of a husband, played with zero flash and fire by Henry Fonda. Couldn't Liz have gotten the ravishing Rod Taylor, probably the most magnificent looking male star eye candy of the 70s?",980121600,32,1990,5.070121951219512
409248,3,6302023637,"While this film may not rival any of Elizabeth Taylor's classic films from the 1950s or '60s, it never tried to be anything other than a showcase for her magnificent beauty, which ironically is the film's main fault. My only complaint with this film is that it is responsible for my life-long infatuation with Elizabeth Taylor. I unequivocally fell in love with La Divinity Liz at a tender age, seeing her not in National Velvet or A Place in the Sun, Cleopatra or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Lord help the boy who falls in love with Martha--I pity poor George), but in Ash Wednesday, a film whose title should perhaps be Smashed Wednesday, judging from the film's producer Dominick Dunne's own admission of the drug and alcohol consumption of the film's participants.
While the film was not a ""megahit"" at the box office and was not well-regarded critically (it also earned little praise from feminists), Ash Wednesday is a stunning showcase for Elizabeth Taylor's exquisite, almost surreal beauty. I saw this film for the first time on television in the 70s, several years after its theatrical release, and fell instantly in love with this beautifully wicked screen goddess, ET. Essentially, this film is a a very strong testament to Elizabeth Taylor's enduring beauty, well preserved and documented in this magnum opus pop culture commentary on plastic surgery.",969926400,11,1374,5.004366812227074
409249,1,6302023637,"from the beginning.  Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.
ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover.  It is a ""we have to value what we've got"" sort of thing.
Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham.  I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained.  On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie.  I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film.  It is dull and pretentious!",958003200,5,758,4.41726618705036

7819549,5,6302023637,"Elizabeth Taylor starred in Ash Wednesday and it was released in 1973. It is a grand soap opera which was done in the Ross Hunter style, as he did for Lana Turner. Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Elizabeth was at her loveliest. Fans of Elizabeth, and lovers of splashy soap opera will like this the most.",1363478400,2,314,4.25

Full disclosure:  I prefer movies with submarines and a lot of things blowing up, so take that into account.",1266537600,,266,4.137254901960785
7819552,5,6302023637,"Although I have heard reviews of this movie having a dry storyline, Elizabeth Taylor makes it worth while...although someone should make Henry Fonda look younger. I do think it's one of the lesser greats of Dame Taylor but, to me if it's got her it's worth anything!!!!! I love you Dame Elizabeth ;) Thanks for making so many great & memorable movies for me to enjoy for a long time to come.",1246233600,2,391,4.444444444444445
7819553,5,6302023637,"One of the great campy films of the 70's. A glitz and glamour melodrama of an insecure wife (aren't they all in these types of films ?) who goes to Europe to get major cosmetic surgery to please her man and ends up bedding a gigolo as well. You'll have a ball watching la Liz (in Edith Head gowns) strutting her new and improved self while throwing such lines as ""Look at these b------. Aren't they beautiful ? What more do you need ?"" to her uninterested soon-to-be ex-husband, played by Henry Fonda. This so-bad-its-so-good moment is just one of many delivered in an otherwise non-existent plot. Maurice Jarre's syrupy score and Larry Peerce's gauzy soft focus direction set the exact tone for this great guilty pleasure that needs to be seen to be believed.-----Martin Boucher",1106179200,3,779,4.735294117647059
