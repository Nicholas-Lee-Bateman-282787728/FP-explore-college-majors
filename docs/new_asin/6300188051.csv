Borrowing from another review: Setting: Greek Islands Ari can't satisfy his wife Sara (Ajita Wilson). He crashes his speedboat into a cliff and winds up in Switzerland for rehabilitation in what may or may not have been a suicide attempt. Alex, commissioned to paint Sara's portrait by Ari, becomes Sara's house guest and sex partner in Ari's absence. Teresa, Ari's secretary and ex-lover, is jealous of Sara's relationship with Alex and schemes to break them up. **Spoilerphobiacs beware** Ari, suspecting that Sara has a lover, hires an investigator/photographer to secure the evidence. The investigator gets his incriminating photos and then offers them to Sara for a price. She pays with her money and her body.  Erotiki ekstasi (original title)",1355961600,,966,4.95679012345679
