8296304,1,B001E4VF1E,"The documentary was advertised as being about the Cold War, when in fact it was all about the Nazis.  I contacted the vendor to report that, and he said that this kind of forum was not for discussing politics-obviously an unresponsive answer.  The Cold War followed WWII, and there were no Nazis involved in the Cold War. The vendor should be required to amend his description. Period.",1506816000,,385,4.731343283582089
