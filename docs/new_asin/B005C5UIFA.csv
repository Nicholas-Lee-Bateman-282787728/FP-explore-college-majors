4651483,5,B005C5UIFA,"This is just fantastic if you're a fan of B-Westerns. They're all here, all the stars of the old Cowboy Movies of the 1930's-40's. Buck, Tim, Roy, Gene, Lash, Hoppy, Hoot and the rest of the gang band together via film clips to destroy MYSTERY MOUNTAIN's super villain The Rattler. You get to see 'em all ride into town alone, meet at the saloon together, and engage in one of the best bar-room brawls ever commited to stock footage. This is only topped by the BIG running gunfight throughout town and the rounding up of all the badguys, including several Charlie King appearances!

There's nothing quite like this. It just has to be seen to be appreciated. Super Highly Recommended!",1329696000,13,683,4.691666666666666
4651484,5,B005C5UIFA,Very enjoyable.  Images of the great B-Western stars of the 30s and 40s that you won't see anyplace else unless you purchase the DVD (if available).  Excellent commentary by Pat Buttram.,1322179200,10,186,4.967741935483871
4651485,5,B005C5UIFA,"It's hard to believe that this highly entertaining and often hilarious movie is actually a mash-up of clips from 78 different B-Western films. Somehow the producer managed to skillfully piece scenes together to create a story that, while intentionally outrageous, pretty much represents plots typical of the genre. All this was done so cleverly that it's often difficult to tell whether a scene is straight from a single movie or was created from compiled clips from various originals. The narration by Pat Buttram is cleverly written, perfectly delivered, and helps the viewer follow the ""plot"" (such as it is).
The result is a wonderfully enjoyable romp that looks back on and celebrates the cowboy-hero era with great enthusiasm, delightful humor, and more than a little affection. Highly recommended.",1313280000,13,804,5.2890625
4651486,5,B005C5UIFA,"They're all here in one brilliantly watchable master movie of the Old West, the heroes of a million American childhoods - Gene Autry, Bob Steele, Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Hoot Gibson, Hopalong Cassidy, Tim McCoy, and dozens more, along with their horses, and battalions of kissable girls, and venomous range bosses with string ties and black mustaches, and a host of gunslingers who ride in gangs hell bent for leather down country roads all firing six-shooters at the hero fleeing ahead - you know you've seen this road before - it was an hour's ride from Hollywood, in the 1930s, but it's lined by developments now, and on the living room wall of every last one of them is a fifty inch flatscreen TV, and in front of every screen is a kid in ""short"" pants halfway to his knees, lying lengthwise on a couch, madly thumbing an electronic game, and you know that thundering across that screen no one will ever see another gang of gunslingers on horses chasing the cowboy hero. The gunfight is over. The men who sprang on horses from behind, or out of second story windows, are all dead. The kissable girls are dead or great-grandmothers with memories. An ungodly number of what were once called horse operas or B Westerns have been harvested of their best scenes for MEANWHILE BACK AT THE RANCH - which lasts just about exactly as long as the westerns I watched on a twelve-inch Dumont TV in my childhood, and recreates the narrative arc of all of those pictures - the hero, the problem, the bad guy, the girl, the chase, the showdown, the guys falling through the railing of the saloon balcony, the guy falling off the hotel roof, the guy whipping up the horses on the charging wagon, the ladies crowding the board sidewalks, the milquetoast store clerks, the man who wore the badge, the banker in his squeaky chair, the sidekick with the funny accent, the whispering bad guys, the revolvers with pearl handles... I could go on but I'll stop here. If you know what I'm talking about you won't need any help to bring it all back from memory. And if you don't know what I'm talking about you can find out for a modest ten dollar bill and a rainy afternoon spent watching this absolutely wonderful composite film, which outrages the guardians of the gates of copyright, by taking what it wants from whatever it wants, and splicing it together in a film that makes no sense but perfect sense. This is the Ur-B Western. There is nothing else like it. To see it is to grasp how much there is to mourn.",1312502400,21,2494,4.544444444444444

4651493,5,B005C5UIFA,"This is a fun film starring many of the western heroes we grew up with. It's cleverly tied together into one story and is very entertaining and nostalgic. Indeed, it and the stars who are featured in it puts the ""modern"" westerns to shame!  Especially enjoyed the theme song by Eddie Dean!",1459036800,,289,4.5576923076923075

4651498,5,B005C5UIFA,LOVED IT!!!!! Very amusing and glad they finally came out with it. It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I thought it was very creative the way they pieced all the different  cowboy actors together and was able to make this movie. Loved Pat Butrum as the narrator. He did an awesome job and was the best choice to narrate as he was informative and very funny  in his commentating.,1440028800,2,400,4.465753424657534

4651500,5,B005C5UIFA,Excellent assembly work with several B-westerns and its heroes cowboys edited like it was a movie feature .,1430870400,,107,5.0
4651501,3,B005C5UIFA,"This one has relevance in that Richard Patterson pasted it together in 1976, before TNT and TCM, before the Encore Westerns Channel, during that great drought of the B-western when there was not a whole lot going on for quite a while.  Occasionally a collector would screen a few movies, and there was that PBS Show hosted by Sunset Carson that locally aired about noon on Sunday (make that, time to dine with the in-laws,) but generally pickin's were slim to none.  Once I started a library in the 80's I had thought about tying two VCR's together and making my own movie.  That never took place but I never forgot it.  I know I had no intention of including every major cowboy hero from the 30's to the 50's!

Now forty years down the road, let's celebrate this one for the cornball Pat Buttram narration and the sheer labor of cutting into all those films.  It whets the appetite to try to see all the real films again, and kind of sad the movie sat all those years.",1430611200,2,969,4.385474860335195
4651502,4,B005C5UIFA,"Great fun for fans of the ""B"" westerns of the 30s, 40s and 50s. The producers have gathered clips from several old oaters and edited them together to form a story of sorts where most of the heroes of the old ""B""s (Hoppy, Gene, Roy et al) ride into town to battle the bad guys. (Charlie King, Roy Barcroft, Tom London etc.). Well done and very entertaining.",1427760000,2,356,4.3283582089552235

The plot from the start to the finish, the guys in black working against the good guys.  It's A Fun DVD !",1416700800,,226,3.8085106382978724

4651509,5,B005C5UIFA,"This DVD is a crazy film with no real plot, but who cares, because anyone who grew up liking B westerns will treasure this one.  Most every western ""star"" of the black and white film era is featured in this classic . . . from Roy and Gene to Lash LaRue, the Durango Kid, and Smiley Burnett.",1384819200,,290,4.087719298245614
4651510,5,B005C5UIFA,"This is a treat. A huge list of B western stars at one go! It starts positively by picturing all the stars from Rex Allen to John Wayne, the latter the only one to move onto A westerns. Cleverly & expertly the  film takes scenes from many B  westerns and turns them into a story. You have to be awake to follow the story and more importantly see the stars from way back in action. Wild Bill Elliott one moment, Bob Steele another, then Tex Ritter and Monte Hale plus supporting pals like Gabby Hayes. If you enjoyed B westerns, which are no longer with us except on DVDs this is for you. If you never watched B westerns give this a go even if you do not know all the stars from the past. You will meet Gene Autry, Roy Rogers , the singing cowboys and as mentioned earlier a youthful Duke Wayne. Probably it has to be viewed several times as you will not know all the heroes as some are not easily recognised while Last LaRue with his whip is easily spotted. Why this DVD has taken so long to appear I know not, but the wait is worth it.",1382659200,2,1036,4.098522167487685
4651511,5,B005C5UIFA,"This is a really fun movie.  It was made up of many cuts of many movies and put together skillfully.  I love watching the movie credits under the scenes.  Would have like more JMB scenes, but I am hooked on him.",1375401600,,211,4.097560975609756

4651513,4,B005C5UIFA,"If you are a cowboy fan then this is an ideal opportunity to see them all in one film. The plot, such as it is, is beside the point and, as the film is a load of clips spliced, together that's not surprising. Just sit back and watch the old time heroes ride again and enjoy the fun.",1363737600,5,282,3.8793103448275863
4651514,5,B005C5UIFA,"It is a lot of fun watching this video. It takes me back to those Saturday afternoons spent at the local theater. This one is over 70 different films put together to make one wonderful action ""B"" western.",1363392000,,204,4.394736842105263

4651516,5,B005C5UIFA,"I've waited years for a decent DVD copy of this ""patch-work"" film. I find the ""story"" very entertaining, but what else could you expect from this ""'ol codger"" Saturday Matinee Kid? Yes, as pointed out by another reviewer, the ""story"" is preposterous, but who cares!? As a kid and now as an adult, I am aware that the B-Westerns were never considered ""art"" but their simple scenarios were morally plays concerned with the triumph of ""good"" folk over the ""bad"" folk that populated the motion picture fictional ""Old West"" and they played a significant role in forming the moral attitudes of this ""youngster"" while viewing these old ""gems"" on TV in the mid 1950s. C'mon, give me a break. I may be old but not so old that I actually saw the films culled for this presentation when they were originally released theatrically. Thanks to Amazon one can now sit back and enjoy some innocent fun in a ""story"" starring most of the ""Greats"" of another time: the Saturday Matinee Heroes of a time now regrettably gone forever, but alive again on your family's TV set. The ""Good guys"" were heroic, the ""Bad guys"" were vile, the gals ""Pure,"" the horses could run at a full gallop for hours and never work up a sweat and six-shooters never ran out of bullets. It was a time when everything was ""black and white,"" not only in story telling but picture as well. This release offers those not familiar with the sagebrush sagas of another era a chance to experience what audiences of long ago embraced and emulated. I recommend it, but consider my bias.
