8279934,5,B001AW3UPY,i love comedy so after reading that ladies review i said what the heck and boy am i glad.  that man is insane and as funny as they come.  the part with bush and chenny and the picture is out of this world.  how does he come up with this stuff.  the redneck was just too crazy and you could be a redneck. and the part when the lil boy curses out the lady made my friends laugh till they had tears streaming from their eyes. two of them ordered the dvd because they said they never saw anything so stupid and crazy.  i must have watch it 4 times because i show it to all my friends and i'm still laughing. if he has any other movies they are not on amazon because i checked.  i hope he does make something else because he is really very funny.  i really think everyone needs to see this because you won't believe your eyes.  all i can say is great job you are really very funny.  keep up the good work.,1217376000,,900,3.9555555555555557
8279935,4,B001AW3UPY,"I could not believe my eyes, this man is crazy.  I laughed so much I was almost crying.  I had some girl friends over and they all fell out.  When the lil boy cursed out the lady I could not take it I had to rewind it to make sure that was what I heard.  This man is crazy and he should be locked up and the key should be thrown away.  How does he think of this stuff so fast because you can tell nothing was reheresed.  Even the scene in the resturant he just pulled it off like it was stagged.  He is really good and very funny.  It won't be long before he'll be on HBO or something else because he has skills like Richard Pryor and he is just as funny.  I would highly recommend this dvd to everyone who wants to laugh just go to the bathroom before watching this fool.  Great work keep it up and I hope to see you live someday.",1217289600,,831,3.863905325443787
