All the info you need is right there, reality check about the 'quitos, rain, bears, lodge traffic, and all. It is clear the producer/anglers favor kings and they horse 'em hard to get 'em to jump for the camera, but they cover the river and the native fish. Although I'd go with fly gear for 'bows and grayling, these DVD's are excellent for the real world demonstration of what its like on river and how to fish it in real time. They can be a bit repetitious but that tends to be because they are shot sequentially as the float progresses-- fish kings at two creek mounths in succession and that's what you see. The only things missing are the adrenaline 'shakes' between hookups. Oh, and here's an old Eel River ""bottom bouncing"" trick; instead of cutting up pencil sinkers, pinch a string of split shot on a 6 lb. test dropper (or 1/2 test main line) and add or remove to depth desired; a snagged split shot pulls off dropper plus you don't end up with a pocket full of too short pencils.",1202083200,,1071,4.441624365482234

They have enough detail to save a person many hours of research and go a long way to ensuring a successful trip.  Coordinates are even provided indicating specific areas where the best fishing is to be found, campsites, and etc.  These videos are designed to provide a great experience while avoiding unnecessary expense.",1184025600,,421,4.819444444444445
7794851,4,0977949109,"The Duke bros. do a good job giving insights on what and where to plan for a guideless riverfloat. A bit too much of the Dukes horsing

in kings and little on other species...also would have liked

more info on preparation and riversmarts. Nevertheless, its

the best of the available info out there and has much more low budget

charm than self-promotion. I've purchased two DVDs and am happy

with both.",1180742400,,405,4.647887323943662
7794852,5,0977949109,"I have spent numerous hours researching information on Alaska fishing and have a small library of fishing books on Alaska rivers, but you won't find a better all in one source of detailed information than the Duke's Talachulitna video and dvd insert.  These guys know how to catch kings like no one I have ever seen before.  Even if I never get a chance to float the Tal River, I feel like I have been there.  Looking forward to more Duke Outdoor videos - keep up the great work!
