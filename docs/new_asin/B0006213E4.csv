8036646,4,B0006213E4,A young Walter Cronkite  puts you into history in the making!,1419552000,,61,4.545454545454546
8036647,5,B0006213E4,"I remember seeing this on TV when I was a child (yes, I'm that old!).  The series ""You Are There"" was one I loved, but this episode in particular stayed with me.  What's worth living for?  What's worth dying for?  Why does Socrates choose to stay in Athens, though it means his death?  Here, in half an hour, is the essence of Socrates and why his thoughts are still a huge part of our philosophical tradition.  Also fun is watching some very young actors who would soon become very familiar faces.

DVD review - the quality is good, not great.",1344211200,,544,4.38
8036648,5,B0006213E4,"I can well remember sitting in our family's living room in the 1950's watching ""YOU ARE THERE.""  There was a sense that, through the magic of television, we really were there.  Pleasantly hokey, it is much to be preferred over what we encounter on the tube today.",1334793600,,263,4.574468085106383
8036649,4,B0006213E4,"I showed this to my 5 and 7 year old after we'd studied Ancient Greece for 5 weeks.  They both liked it a lot as it brought to life stuff they'd read.  There's not a lot out there like this.  And we find it really helpful to watch something at the end of a unit to cement the kids' learning.  The 5 year old needed a fair bit of explaining.  But still was fascinated by a guy choosing death because of his beliefs.  Really well worth it.  Bit of a shame all the actors had American accents!  But a great and thoughtful production, nice and simple from the 50's I think without today's ridiculous emphasis on special effects which would have ruined the simplicity of such a production if it were made today.
