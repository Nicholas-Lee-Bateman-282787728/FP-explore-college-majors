11985,5,0767830555,"Robert De Niro has always been known as an actor who takes his parts very seriously.  In fact, during the filming of Taxi Driver he actually drove a taxi for 2 weeks before someone noticed him.  The movie takes the viewer  right out of his/her chair and drives them in the taxi towards the road of  imagination.  It's incredable how Robert takes us in many of his movies!  This is most definately a movie to add to your collection if your a true  movie fan!",923356800,,457,4.305882352941176
11986,5,0767830555,"I can't believe I am the first to write a review of this film.  I'm not worthy.  This movie has been quoted to death and picked apart as much or more then any film in the last quarter century.  There is good reason.  More then anything this movie is a study in madness and sanity.  We all  feel as Travis does sometimes.  The world has gone to hell and a rain  should come and wash away all the garbage off the street, all of it.  Of  course we, as sane people, realise this is wrong thinking and get over it.  Travis does not.  Travis Bickle is an  unbalanced person who just wants to  be a normal person, like anyone else.  He tries this.  He gets a job  driving a cab becouse he can't sleep nights ""there's porno theaters  for that"" the cab manager tells him.  And indeed there are.  But  Travis has no interest in sex, he just goes into the pornos becouse that's  were other people go, he wants to be like other people.  Had he lived in a  small town instead of New York, he may just as well have followed the heard  into church or to the mall.  his neighborhood has no churches  so he goes  to see dirty movies.  Travis wouldn't know a dirty movie from a pop-tart.  This is made painfully clear when he asks a girl out on a date.  Bickle is  sitting in his cab whe ""she"" walks by.  Cyble Shepard.  ""she"" is wearing a white dress, she was like an angle in this  filthy mass, ""they must not touch her"".  Travis actually  convinces this high class beauty to go to the movies with him.  You can  guess what happens next.  He takes her to the only movies he knows about.  Needless to say, Betsy (shepards character) is not a fan of ""Somethime  Sweet Susan"" and ""Swedish Marrage Manual""  She storms off  and refuses his calls.  Travis didn't mean any harm.  He can not understand  why his genuine efforts to fit in don't work.  He becomes angry and self  absorbed.  He meets a 12 year old prostitute and after  his ill fated date  with Betsy goed to see her.  Harvey Kietel is as good as he has ever been  as the pimp who tells Travis about the little girl he is going to see.  I  won't quote him here as I am sure the good folks at Amason would not  appreciate it, but he gives a graphic detailed discription of all the  sexual things Travis can do with this 12 and a half year old girl.  Travis  had no intentions of doing anything with this child.  He talks to her and  says ""you're a young girl you should be in school""  What a nut.  Any sane person can see that she (Iris) is a whore and can only be a whore.  No one in this film, none of the ""sane"" emotionally stable,  normal people do anything to help or are even upset at this arrangement ( a  pimp and a 12 year old girl) they either buy her services or ignore the  situation.  Bickle takes Iris (Jodie Fosters 12 year old hooker character)  to breakfast and tells her she should not be selling herself on the street  for a bunch of pimps and lowlifes.  In a very moving performance, Jodie  Fosters character looks at him like he is form outer space ""I don't  know who's wierder, you or me""  She really can't understand that  someone cares about her and that what she is doing is wrong.  The only  person in the world that says what is right, that 12 year old girls don't  belong ont he streets whoring, is a raving nut.  Who are the crazys and who  are the sane? Travis eventually loses control and goes on a shooting spree.  He kills off a bunch of people the police don't like anyway so he is a  hero.  Some problems can only be solved by a crazy, lonely white guy with a  pistol.  ""You talkin' to me?  I don't see nobody else here"".  This is the first time Jodie Foster was recognised as a great actress, she  was nominated for best supporting actress and deservedly so.  Martin  Scorsese has done films as good as this, but never better.  I can't  recomend in enough. ""Lost Johnny""",919382400,2,3845,4.198060941828255
11987,5,0767830555,"Taxi driver exemplifies one of the greatest delves into the human psyche that I could ever imagine.  From the beginning, it is clearly blatant that Travis, Robert Deniro's character, is trying to make right in a world and  society gone completely wrong. A trend seen to this day. He is just another  face in the violent, turbulent crowd of a mean-spirited city like New York.  A true grief - striken story of man versus the elements and environment  around him. What is portrayed here is a man who ""would not take it  anymore."" He is sickened by the environment around him that just will  never leave him alone. How many of us have felt this way? He tried to  assimilate himself in society but can't cope with the tools he has.  I'm  always taken back by the scene in his apartment with the Jackson Browne  song in the background.  Travis begins to realize his world is falling  apart around him. I recommend this movie to anyone fed up with society,  alienated from the evils of the world and overall tired of all the nonsense  we must face from day to day. Truly, one of the greatest movies of all  time!",917136000,4,1106,4.455
11988,5,0767830555,"This is perhaps the greatest American film of the past 30 years. TAXI DRIVER explores themes and characters that are archetypically American. If you've ever read about Tim McVeigh or John Hinckley, or ever wondered about the nameless nobody who seems to lurk on your city's streets, you know the Scorsese and De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader were there first. This is a brave, moral, explosive and graphic film that has only gained power over the years.

With its antecedents in literature like Dostoevsky's ""Notes from Undergound"" and Sartre's ""Nausea"" and Camus' ""Stranger"" and French art films likes ""Pickpocket"" and ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" as well as the real-life would-be assassin Arthur Bremer (who shot George Wallace in 1972), TAXI DRIVER takes a new direction by linking its protagonist's psychological wounds with sex and Viet Nam. Bickle's experiences in the war are subtly implied here, and all the more artful and true for that. Travis has been trained as a warrior and then thrown into the urban jungle. Obsessed and horrified by sex and women--what a perfectly American trait--his fantasies soon meld into an orgy of violence and perverted heroism. Ain't that America? A critic once said Travis Bickle was the offspring of John Wayne and Norman Bates. Perfect: misplaced psychosis is interpreted as heroism.

Every aspect of this film is marvelous and prescient, vividly realized and superbly acted. The violent climax is morally right and true, no matter what any critic says; it is the inevitable outcome of Travis' psyche. Anything less would have been a cheat, dishonest, a lie. Scorsese's appearance as a homicidal jilted husband is blood-chilling; in only a few sentences he sums up the base mentality of, I fear sometimes, this entire American culture.

I can't even watch TAXI DRIVER anymore; it sears my nerves from the opening notes of Bernard Herrmann's score and the first images of hellish, neon-lit NYC. I can no longer bear to see the utter loneliness of Travis Bickle, or hear him say ""I got some bad ideas in my head."" I cannot watch his conversations with Iris, the 12-year-old prostitute. I can't stand to see him before his mirror, forsaken and frozen, contemplating the darkest things in his heart, playing with his pathetic, terrifying weapons. This is the truest film I know, and if every piece of celluloid in history were going up in flames, this is the only one I'd save. TAXI DRIVER. Goddamn.",911952000,,2446,4.990196078431373

12021,2,0767830555,"Movie 6 of 1976 and 37 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

I have had my eyes on this one for years. In fact so many 70's films exceeded my expectations that I wanted to buy it before I started 1976 to ensure it didn't go under the radar. I'm not disappointed with ""Taxi Driver"" it is precisely what I expected. I think what happened is over the years no one could give me a good reason to watch it. They just said it was great. All the effusive accolades amounted to vapid emotion to me. I want well thought out reasons why a movie is supposed to be good. I don't care who's in it, who directed it, or likes it, no movie gets a pass. If you aren't good then I'm going to say so and ""Taxi Driver"" is not good. It's boring and unfocused.
First and foremost was the daunting burden of having to listen to that droning music for two hours. I don't care if the point was to task us with the mind set of Bickle or not that was just atrocious! It was the musical equivalent to having a pebble stuck in your shoe as you walk: it's there nagging you about how crappy it is and you can't get rid of it and it does nothing other than be crappy and annoying. Completely ruined the movie for me. Now according to the composer it was a reflection of the main character's thoughts and mind set. Well there is an evolution of thought so why did the music remain static? I don't care about the great movies Herrmann had done before,  he did an awful job. It lacked creativity to me. I know the guy is in a cab all night long,  alone, night after night, so what? Is that worthy of any music that would reflect it? How about music that hints at the tedium without being tedious? I understand that Scorsese could have perhaps chosen other songs, I don't really care, just a mess in my opinion.
""Taxi Driver"" lacked focus. There was an interesting glimmer of thought where Bickle would judge those who might have been upstanding (Shepard) and worked to redeem those whom might have been considered ""scum."" I also liked the idea that there is a thin line between hero and villain that plays out. It was just too long of a meandering journey to get there.
One of Scorsese's biggest strengths needs to be tempered. He is incredibly aware of the camera's effect on the audience. The way we see only DeNiro's torso then the camera springs up suddenly to his head to reveal his Mohawk was jarring and very well done. The violence at the end was incredibly effective, I was jaw dropped. It couldn't save the story for me though and I wondered if this was a crutch for an otherwise bland ending. I do think the theme of hero/villain was movie worthy, that is to say there was a good point to the story but it just wasn't enough for me.
In the end I think ""Taxi Driver"" was just overrated as far as I'm concerned.

Pros
-DeNiro is great
-Foster's story line is interesting and compelling
-theme has weight
-Superb camera work
Cons

12025,1,0767830555,"This movie was recommended to me and I had heard that it was classic and like De Niro as an actor along with Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel.  If you were to edit the useless scenes out of this movie it'd be about 30 min.  Foster is billed as a main character but has one scene in the first hour.  Shepherd's character serves no purpose outside of showing that De Niro's character has issues, which you should be able to figure out fairly easy without her character.

Having not been alive when this movie came I'm not going to try to understand the time because I simply can't but this movie is so utterly boring that it almost puts you to sleep.  Then just when you think it's going to get good with a shootout De Niro gets shot in the neck and shoulder and just keeps on going.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.  It's boring and bad.  Acting is mediocre, story is fine except it doesn't show up until the 30 min, music is annoying, and you spend an hour learning that De Niro is a taxi driver and then the back half of the movie he's not doing it anymore.",1514073600,,1072,4.169902912621359
12026,3,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" is a character study more than a story. I can believe that Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay in a fever dream while living in his car: it's mostly about a state of mind, the main character's loneliness and rage. All the other plot details were probably added after the fact. Complementing the script, Robert De Niro buries himself in the part more than in any other film of his career.

The film frequently feels nervewracking because of how deeply it sees into the protagonist's mind. A few words into De Niro's ""Listen up, you screw-heads"" speech, there is a curious jump-cut and the speech starts over from the beginning. But it's not some avant-garde film device, it's pure reality -- for someone like Travis Bickle, every internal monologue is a rehearsal, he is always imagining himself as an action hero, always playing a scene out in his head, thinking of cooler versions of his ""lines"" and revising them in mid-delivery. The famous ""you're talking to me?"" line is actually part of a long series of threats that Travis makes to an invisible enemy while posing in front of a mirror with his guns.

In his isolation, Travis can only function in his rare social interactions by relying on cues from previous events. For example, he asks the arms dealer for a specific type of gun, but he first learned the name of that gun only a few days ago when it was mentioned by one of his clients. This completely random event allows him to appear knowledgeable about guns, but really he knows nothing about the type (and ends up buying all of them). Psychologically, this is a fine nuance, one of the things that shows how well the film-makers feel their character. It also contradicts the formal plot of the film -- as a war veteran, wouldn't Travis have picked up some information about firearms? (More importantly, wouldn't he at least have picked up rudimentary conversational skills from the guys in his platoon?)

But the film-makers don't care about that. According to them, the Vietnam backstory was meant to highlight Travis' alienation from society, and I suspect they just didn't bother to think through plot consistency. For years, viewers have debated whether the ending (in which, ironically, Travis is hailed as a hero) was meant to be ""real,"" or whether it only took place in Travis' head. But you might as well ask that question much earlier. Did the entire shoot-out ever really take place, or was it just part of Travis' action-hero fantasy? Did he really try to assassinate Palantine, or did he just fantasize about it, and then ""revise"" his fantasy to follow the more ""romantic"" storyline of rescuing the girl from the pimps? Did he really shoot the robber in the store? Was he ever even in Vietnam? If he self-importantly tells people that he's ""doing some work for the government,"" why couldn't he make up a Vietnam background? Was his exercise regimen real, or did he just imagine himself holding his hand out over the gas burner? As many critics have pointed out, nearly every scene is told from Travis' point of view, so potentially any scene after the failed date could be the film's last moment of ""reality.""

It is intellectually interesting to think about things like that, but unfortunately it is also a weakness of the film. The film-makers had a character, but ultimately they didn't know what to do with him or say about him, or how to end their movie. The film is a perceptive profile of a psychological type that could easily snap and become a loose cannon. But where did he come from, how did he get this way? The film's only explanation is Vietnam, but we have seen many Travis-like characters on the news in recent years, and usually they are not veterans. And, more importantly, is there anything that should or could be done to reach out to people like Travis? Was there ever any way to help him? The ending side-steps this question with some stylized violence, and then glibly criticizes media sensationalism (for you see, they would have condemned Travis for shooting Palantine, but they praise him for slaughtering a bunch of criminals). It's hard to argue with that, but it's also pretty obvious, and doesn't shed any useful light on the main issue.",1513555200,,4205,4.748290013679891

12028,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver (1976) is a film that often appears on lists of the top 100 films of all time. Perhaps that may be true, but I give pause. I think Taxi Driver is a very good film, but a tad overrated. I was expecting a little more in terms of plot twists and suspense, but it never went there. Still, this is one fine film by acclaimed director Martin Scorsese. I like Scorsese because he doesn't hold back; he doesn't play it safe when trying to tell a story. Some directors keep things light, but Scorsese goes for the gusto, and that triggers the emotional element that's so prevalent in his films. The cast of this film was on top of their game, and even newcomer Jodie Foster is believable in her role as a troubled teen. This blu ray set will keep you entertained for hours, with some nice special features. The picture and sound quality are first-rate for a film that's over 40 years old, so the cleanup job was a successful one.

12073,4,0767830555,"Forty years ago audiences were stunned by the movie TAXI DRIVER. Not only did it depict New York City as a world filled with seedy characters it was the first major role for Robert DeNiro who had grabbed the screen by the throat three years earlier in MEAN STREETS. It was also introduced writer Paul Schrader to most of the world, his only previous onscreen offering having been THE YAKUZA two years prior and was a follow up for director Martin Scorsese who had directed ALICE DOESNT LIVE HERE ANYMORE 2 years earlier as well. This combination of talent created a movie still talked about to this day.

DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a slightly unhinged Vietnam War vet dealing with bouts of insomnia. To make money while dealing with this he takes on the job of a night time taxi driver in New York. Rather than the up and coming Wall Street crowds this lends itself to his dealing with customers of an unsavory nature. Pimps and hustlers, prostitutes and riders with no issue having sex in the back seat while he drives. Its a slimy world that we view through his eyes.

While he may seem undisturbed by all of this there is a strange sense of decency lying underneath this crust on display. Bickle has his own sense of what is right and wrong but even that is askew from what most of us would agree with. He looks down on the denizens of the night but doesnt even realize how bad things are until we see later.

He befriends a young girl on the street, a near pre-teen prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster). For him its a question of friendship and trying to help her. For her hes just another john, but someone nice rather than the usual clients she has.

One afternoon he notices a young woman working in the campaign office of Senator Charles Palantine. Obsessed with her he watches her whenever he can. One day he walks in and applies to work for the campaign, finding out her name is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). He asks her out on a date and she agrees. But here is the glimpse of his not knowing right from wrong as he takes her to a XXX movie on the date. She walks out disturbed as he tries to find out what he did wrong, having no clue.

While still pursuing her he is pushed aside, denied the chance he longed for. This leads him to feel the need to do something to atone for the mistake he made, a way of cleansing the city streets he rides of the filth he sees there nightly. His mind is twisted and his first thought involved assassinating Palantine. But before the films end his search for redemption will lead him elsewhere.

The combined efforts of those mentioned earlier make this film work on all levels. Scorsese, a native of New York City, brings forth images of a location he knows well, the streets and neighborhoods he walked when he was young. Its gritty, dirty and down to earth, no picture postcard land of hope. Schraders script builds on the location. The film could not have taken place in Boise. It allows us a glimpse at what lives in the darkened alleyways, the hopeless masses that find themselves working at the lowest of possible jobs just to survive where the law of the jungle rules.

DeNiro made a name for himself with his performance here. Its not just the words that Bickle speaks, most of which are in his narration of events. Its not the way that he looks at the world or watches what is going on around him. Its not the odd way of thinking in a nave way that makes him who he is. It is the combination of all of these things and more that make him shine in this role.

Everyone remembers the most quoted line from this film, Are you talkin to me? It is one moment in the film but a powerful one in the most subtle way. It shows the character of Bickle slowly losing touch with reality. There is no telling where he will go from here.

The movie remains a work of art as well as an entertaining film. Of course not entertaining for everyone, especially the easily offended. But to watch it now, 40 years later, and still feel its impact says a lot. Extras include three different commentary tracks, a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A for the 40th Anniversary, featurettes including Martin Scorsese on Taxi Driver, Producing Taxi Driver, Gods Lonely Man, Influence and Appreciation: A Martin Scorsese Tribute, Taxi Driver Stories, Travis New York and Travis New York Locations, the theatrical trailer, the documentary Making Taxi Driver, the featurette Intro to Storyboards by Martin Scorsese, a storyboard to film comparison and galleries.

If youve never seen the film this is the way to do it. Not only because of the ton of extras included but because its the cleanest presentation of the film to date. Once seen it is not easily forgotten. It really is as good as they say.",1505001600,,4712,4.46860465116279

DeNiro is a quiet revelation in this. There is not a dull moment in this film, and every scene builds to its climax. The final scene is haunting, and you realize that Travis is stuck in some sort of Hell for which he can not escape. Scorsese's best film, in my humble opinion.",1497657600,6,546,4.525252525252525

12119,1,0767830555,"You would think that something like this from the 70s would be something that is classic entertainment. Instead, this is your run of the mill, vintage diarrhea that looks like disgusting Vienna Sausage coming out of an Hungarian apes rectum, with nobodies that have terrible acting. I realize that this movie is critically acclaimed, and the plot for this movie is decent for the people who decided to make a shooting movie, but this movie is one pile of rectum dung heap that ceased to make me think this is just some movie. All that says that is one particular clip in a liquor store where this stupid black bank robber comes in and uses the GD word while trying to steal money from the clerk. Hearing the GD word come out of this pile of steaming trash made me so infuriated that I wante to scream so loud that it would kill me. USING THE 'GD' WORD IN A MOVIE IS INEXCUSABLE REPULSIVE!!!! Every time it is used, it is always by some useless nobody actor who let's this word just fly right out of his diarrhea toilet bowl scented mouth. I don't mind the fact that he is cursing, but using the GD word, or anything else that takes God's or Jesus's name in vein is incredibly wrong. I'm glad this nobody was killed in this scene, because he he deserved to die and suffer for eternity.

Do not watch this movie, or any movie with cursing where nobody actors use the GD word while trying to get their point out while using swear words. Watch movies that are innovative where the usage of this word is easy to ignore. This, and examples of other movies such as Point Break, Lean On Me, Casino, and any other movie that I can't seem to think about are piles of elephant butt foster that need to get impaled in a trash can.",1496016000,,1718,4.3354037267080745

I understand subtlety but there is such a thing as too much subtlety as well.  The shootout in the end was so ridiculous that it had me laughing.

I thought I had an idea of what the movie would be like, but I was off, and that's a good thing. This had a great story, great acting, great script, great directing, and great suspense. I absolutely love the raw classic look of the 1970's.

Robert DeNiro stars as Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine. He's depressed and lonely and drives a taxi to make money. He soon becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Their relationship is quite awkward. He also becomes interested in helping a teen prostitute named Iris (played by a young Jodie Foster) get out of the hooker life. Travis becomes a vigilante by buying up guns and tries to help clean New York of corruption and overbearing pimps. I will consider buying the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray of this film.

Critics have discussed the meaning of the film ever since it came out. Suffice it to say Scorsese's goal was to combine gritty naturalism with a genuine compassion for his characters. If God may have abandoned these lost souls, Scorsese and Schrader have not--at least not completely.

Taxi Driver seems like Mean Streets revisited, Mean Streets pumped up on acid and Quaaludes. Heredity and environment are the major forces affecting characters, but the tone of the movie is a lot more entertaining and enjoyable than it ought to be. De Niro's acting as Travis Bickle is obviously a large part of that appeal.

There are loads and loads of extra features--good ones, actually--if you want to become an expert on all things about Taxi Driver.",1468108800,2,1077,4.972222222222222

I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind!

He had this movie, Godfather Part II, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull all within the same basic time frame. When DeNiro and Scorsese were teaming up to make movies it was the best actor/director combinations in movie history. You had the best mind for movies in Scorsese working with the best on screen performer of his time.

It's a study of a man who's completely alone in the world even when surrounded by other people. What DeNiro was able to do just looking into a mirror asking ""Are you talking to me"" by himself is one of the best movie scenes in movie history.",1449878400,3,806,4.558620689655172

12457,4,0767830555,"Viewer's experience should lead to catharsis and growth. 4 stars for room for improvement.  5 stars for profundity and superiority to most films.

The film makers need to focus more intentionally on the Viewer's Experience:  In the commentary they miss the point and the potential of the movie.  (This is often the case with these commentaries.)  They seem to polish their egos a little too much rather than keep the focus on the viewer's experience.  The viewer is not just a viewer, a camera technique, an angle.  The viewer is experiencing something that is leading to growth or insight or release, or the film or art has failed.

To be fair, I did not, could not, listen to all the commentary about the film but was surprised that what I experienced in the film was not at all what they were talking about.

There's a great deal of extra material on the two disks...if you like that kind thing:  going around and about the film from every possible angle -- but often avoiding going deeper into the film, distracting from the take away, homogenizing our experience into movie-making and acting and other trivia, exactly the thing we should seek to forget in order to internalize and participate in the creative experience.

1. The film even as it stands -- without improvement -- is not primarily about loneliness, unless loneliness simply is a word for all that ails human beings.  I can't make a final judgment about the professor's thoughts about loneliness as this movie's theme unless I read his book about loneliness in film, but...not quite true for Travis.

Travis is not primarily seeking companionship or he would act differently.  Human contact is not his primary value. He looks desperately lonely to many viewers no doubt, and we tend to think what happened would not have happened if he were attached somehow to someone -- anyone...not seeing how desperate a belief that is.

To me it's highly significant that Travis writes.  He is writing about his experience: he is wanting to understand life, his life, to grow. And he does not want to take the easy out. In fact, his bringing Betsy to a porn movie is only stupid if his primary need were to escape loneliness. Travis's behavior here only makes sense as an attempt to bring his vision of a pure and angelic other into the world he is seeing and trying to make sense of.  He needs another view but he needs someone who can go into his world enough to understand.

2.  Neither is the film about a Vietnam vet who is or becomes psychotic and shoots 'em up, not primarily.  If that were true than this film would not even deserve 1 star.

Somehow the film has to be about you and me, and it has to open a door into our shared human condition.  As soon as we show our fear by describing and talking about lonely vet Travis, a ""psychotic"" or crazy, out there somewhere, we are distancing ourselves and the film becomes a failed attempt at entertainment or merely a way to affirm our own safety and sanity. We merely toughen ourselves, not soften ourselves to the true power of this film.

So I was disappointed to hear the writer and professor talking that way in the features. They didn't seem to ""get"" the powerful potential of their own work.  Or at least it eluded them when they spoke, or perhaps it eluded them after the success of the film or the book and their claim of ownership to something permanent.  Instead they should seek to open up a discussion to viewers about how the film could communicate it's potential meaning more effectively to more people.

The trouble with an anti-hero is that we are tempted not to identify with him.  It is too painful.  The Greeks knew they could only create catharsis through identifying with a larger than life figure.  The film plays with that awareness that we have to raise the protagonist to heroic proportions somehow in order to find our way.

I liked all the acting very much.  Every character was fantastic, real and powerful.  The ending, however struck a note of unreality.  None the less, this felt perfectly right, because the film is expressive of psychological viewpoint: the eyes being a central symbol.

Travis's eyes (as is true of us all) see selectively. The film is playing with the idea that humans have limited views and distortions: for example, the angelic American goddess  in the back of the cab, who suddenly is adoring Travis as heroic, is conceivable:  People do follow the interpretation of events they read in newspapers, the interpretations they want to hold.

But I was left feeling unsure whether Travis had actually gone ballistic or just imagined it. So for the ending I think Travis should have looked a little different from the beginning.  His looks showed that they filmed the ending before the tomahawk haircut, it showed the seams of the work, let's say.

Yes, circling back to the beginning is effective in this case -- but not exactly the beginning -- never exactly the beginning. There has to be a change however subtle, or the circling is meaningless and it is not a real circling.  His hair could have been cut a little different, shorter, something.

The ending left me seeing him as both crazy and sane.  He was sane, he went crazy and he came back to sanity, or not, never completely.  And so we all are (he is a cab-driver again, just one of the millions of people in New York).  We never know what could break us. Ironically if we look with full sanely at the dark side we are most in danger.

And there will be a next time was the message, someone will go off the deep end, but not necessarily Travis. He is not the problem. That's how I experienced the ending....Travis shocked by his own eyes in the cab mirror...those eyes could belong to anyone riding the cab.  After all the Travis character did not have threatening eyes.  De Nero's eyes in fact sometimes burst out with happy sparkles.  Rather his eyes are universal, the potential harm or good lurking there determined by how we see things and whether we feel we can act to improve things.

Travis was the most sane in a way.  He was seeing how bad things really were and was not in denial.  The other taxi drivers and other characters had defense mechanisms of one kind or another. Perhaps all that keeps us sane are our favorite defense mechanisms. This is both good and bad.  Because if denial is too complete then the only prophets we can have are crazy.",1445126400,2,6383,4.608503100088574

12577,2,0767830555,"I recently re-viewed Taxi Driver to see if it might make a better impression than 30 years ago.  It didn't.  Scorcese's confounding lack of character development, a gratuitous and underdeveloped plot, grimy violence, and lurid musical score contribute to a sludgy mess that gained accolades over the years primarily due to its cutting edge approach to the subject matter.  Well, it's no longer 1976, and the decades gone by have not been kind to the film.

Truly great films transcend the times in which they were made, and Taxi Driver, with its mannered and one dimensional performances, suffers from a lack of emotional credibility.  We never witness Bickle's motivations or demons, instead viewing him as a two dimensional, socially inept caricature who can't handle male-female interaction. Then, almost spontaneously he obsesses on making a violent ""big statement"".  The dialog and plotting provides little insight into this tormented man's inner voices- Is he suffering PTSD? Is he the product of a terrible home situation? Where do the violent and anti-social tendencies come from? What are Bickle's primary motivations?

I'm incredulous as to how Taxi Driver has sustained its aura after all these years when it basically plays out like a low budget, violent melodrama with a tawdry and frankly unbelievable conclusion. If it wasn't for Jodie Foster's amazing portrayal of the world weary teenage prostitute, there'd be little reason to watch the film other than for curiosity's sake.",1434326400,3,1492,5.270042194092827

12588,5,0767830555,"At last Ive gotten around to watching this famous older film.  It is of interest both as a piece of art and a piece of history.  In the argument over whether or not the media prompts violence, it surely must still be of interest that the film depicts De Niros taxi driver as developing the notion of killing the Presidential candidate and rescuing the young hooker Jodie Foster, and that John Hinckley subsequently tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan to prove to Jodie Foster that he loved her.

The film references her as being only 12 years old, and I thought NO WAY!  Thats ridiculous, shes obviously at least 18 to 20.  Turns out she actually was 12 or 13 at the time, but her dress, her makeup and demeanor made her look older than her character and the actor herself was at the time.

Its also amazing to see young De Niro in this film as a man of nothing but skin, bones and musclehardly an ounce of fat is visible.  Even back then he was already a legend in the film industry, and like just a handful of other actors and actresses, he still remains a film legend some 40 years later.

At the time of the storys setting, America had retreated from Vietnam, the Watergate scandal and Nixons impeachment trial had unfolded, Woodstock had been replaced by Altamont, and a mood of severe cynicism permeated the US.  Capturing this mood of cynicism, isolation and anger perfectly, the film depicts De Niros character as a Vietnam Veteran working nights as a cab driver because he cant sleep anyhow.  It shows his progressive deterioration from anger and loneliness to one of those insane murderers who haunt our national psyche.  The story has some interesting plot twists which I won't reveal to anyone else who, like me a month ago, still hasn't gotten around to viewing it.  Its perhaps the best depiction of the mind of a deranged killer that Ive seen on film, and is on many lists of the best films ever made.  It deserves to be there.",1432944000,2,1941,4.527220630372493

I finally decided it was time - it has been such an iconic movie - and I never quite know what the references to the movie are about. It was surprisingly still relevant. I was also expecting to be disappointed by the cinemagraphics and it was perfect - and by that I mean - I wasn't distracted by cheesy props or obvious old technology. For as raw and simple as this movie is - it is not simple at all. Robert De Niro - looks so achingly young and plays the ""hero"" - a burned out vet driving a taxi. I couldn't understand why he royally screwed up his date with the woman of his dreams - but it helped to make it clear just how screwed up in the head his character was. Jodi Foster was heartbreakingly young and I kept thinking about my daughters or myself at that age - and how horrible it was that she was so street savvy and so young. But both of their performances were just stellar - absolutely sucked you in and made you believe in them. If I had watched this then - the message may not have been as clear to me - as it is now. One take away for me - is that this is not such an unlikely scenario for our psychologically wounded vets. We have so many out there - at this point in time - ""they"" are saying the average number of veteran suicide a day is 22. 22!!! Watching De Niro's performance was like looking inside the head of one these soldiers - you got that he just didn't care about anything any longer - and it was obvious that no one cared about him. I am a veteran myself - and have some of my own fears. I am completely against wars - because they are nothing more than a racket - making money money for civilians and killing young idealistic people - all for the sake of power. This movie solidified those thoughts for me. Overall I enjoyed it - but it was definitely dark and dreary and should only be watched when your own internal system is well enough to handle this kind of misery.",1431043200,16,2000,4.0786802030456855

one of Rob De niro's finest performance's of course
this is either the 2nd or 3rd time Sony pictures have reissued TAXI DRIVER on blu-ray now again ABC coded
and this 3rd time Sony have advertised it as 40th Anniversary edition
it's been 40years since the film was released in Cinemas that's why
so how is this new blu-ray reissue differ from the previous 2011 blu-ray for eg
well the 1080p 1:85:1 HD transfer for this new 40th is exactly the same as the 2011 blu-ray actually
which was the 4k remaster transfer supervised by Martin scorsese himself
which does look beautiful, very nice sharp & clear picture quality the best the film has ever looked actually
so the only effort Sony made was add new extras plus carry over all the old extras from the old 2 disc dvd set
i think cause so many extras new & old sony had to add 2 discs this time packaged in standard blu-ray case
which is what i like, i hate the Digi-book package but each to their own
Here's the extras anyway
Disc 1 has the feature film
with 3 Audio commentaries, the first 2 have been recycled from the previous dvd versions and the 2011 blu-ray anyway
the 3rd commentary is new commentary with writer Paul schrader
there's also new Q & A featurette pro shot filmed earlier this year
with most of the cast & crew- 42min
plus some of the old small featurettes from the old 2 disc dvd set all remastered in 1080p now
MARTIN SCORSESE ON TAXI DRIVER, PRODUCING TAXI DRIVER, GODS LONELY MAN, TAXI DRIVER STORIES
TRAVIS NEW YORK, TRAVIS NEW YORK LOCATIONS, plus the original Theatrical trailer in 1080p
Disc 2 has the rest of the old extras
MAKING TAXI DRIVER- 70mins Doco from the very old 2 disc dvd set remastered in new 1080p
still photo galleries and other stuff
so time to throw out the very old 2 disc dvd and throw out the old 2011 blu-ray
and buy this new 40th anniversary blu-ray

12737,5,0767830555,"In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama, insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout decaying mid- '70s New York City, wishing for a ""real rain"" to wash the ""scum"" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone, Travis cannot connect with anyone, not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard. He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy, who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese), the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny, a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate, Charles Palatine, to violently ""saving"" teen hooker Iris from her pimp, Sport. Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader, Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences, a study of individual psychosis, and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent, media-fixated Vietnam era.

Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers , aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt, as well as Palatine's political platitudes, also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses, expressive camera moves and angles, and garish colors, all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died), Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view, where De Niro's now-famous ""You talking' to me"" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike, Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R, and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit.

Released in the Bicentennial year, after Vietnam, Watergate, and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life, Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of ""God's lonely man,"" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.

In summary,Taxi Driver must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.",1420588800,,2910,5.37719298245614

Paul Scraders already challenging script is elevated to an even mysterious grandeur as we follow Travis Bickel (Robert De Niro) and his descent or ascent into a psychological journey with an ending that leaves the audience embracing or questioning his morality and humanity. Beautiful cinematography capturing the grim New York of the 70s and a haunting score from Bernard Hermann, also his final, that is equally as important at exploring the lead characters psyche as the camera work, acting and script.",1419292800,,812,5.253846153846154

12822,5,0767830555,"I won't deny I like my De Niro films and I have a soft spot for the edgy slightly off beat Scorsese direction that works so well. This duo partnership has been played out through the years, but this earlier film is arguably one of the best that both men have created.

Right from the first opening scene with the city smoke and taxi moving through it, the close up eye shots of De Niro then the rain beating down on the taxi's windscreen with the street lights out of focus...topped off I might add with the magnificent Bernard Herrmann soundtrack, it's probably one of the most memorable and perfectly executed openings ever on any motion picture. Of course a sizzling opening does not a good film make, but it does set the ""mood"" for what is a highly unusual and very graphic film.

Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle a recently discharged Marine who is looking for work and lives a very odd and secluded life as well as having sleep problems he's down and out but manages to find a job as a ""Taxi Driver"" The odd hours and late nights suit Travis, but he meets a local political campaign worker whom he soon becomes somewhat obsessed with (Cybill Shepherd who plays the part of Betsy)

Travis takes her on a date but his lack of social skills soon ruin the date after he takes Betsy to an adult movie playing in a local cinema. These early scenes show a lack of maturity and isolation of Travis who is detached and indifferent to normal behaviour. But deep down Travis has a sense of morality and is often sickened by what he sees on the streets, the crime and prostitution. He starts to tone himself up and vent his frustration into physical training

The story unfolds when Travis picks up an underage prostitute called ""Iris"" (Jodie Foster) trying to escape from her pimp boss ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), who drags her out of the cab. Travis is concerned by this and arranges to meet with Iris via the prostitution circle but instead of hiring Iris to have sex he tell her he wants to help her get out of prostitution. The later parts of the film revolve mostly around Travis and his new found mission to free Iris from her pimp and let her start a new life. But there are some very memorable moments along the way , the quick action sleeve gun design and mirror scenes, the Mohawk hair cut among many others. Also look out for a small scene where the director is paying Travis to sit in his cab and watch his wife cheating.

It would be easy to put Taxi Driver down as a fairly violent drama without much soul, but the reality is Travis despite being a bit of an oddball has a heart beneath it and his one man mission to extract punishment on the ""scum"" of the streets is a novel twist on the vigilante take. All this wouldn't work were it not for some masterful direction from Martin Scorsese, and some very convincing acting from all the cast members esp De Niro and Foster who both have difficult roles to play.

Cinematography is first class with some great scenes and angles provided by Michael Chapman, wonderful soundtrack and a genuinely meaningful storyline. De Niro provides narration in parts and this hints at the theme which Scorsese would later develop into his trade mark (narration and freeze frames) But here we have a fresh and eager crew and cast delivering up a powerful cinematic punch. The ending is quite violent, in the extra features the documentary (which is well worth a watch on it's own) explains this had to be toned down (colour and saturation wise - blood) to make the R rating, once you see the scene you'll understand why back in this time period the gore was deemed unacceptable. Don't dismiss Taxi Driver as a gore fest pure violence film, there is a serious moral side to the production and it successfully manages to convey a gloomy atmosphere and looks into the mind of a genuinely good man, who is mostly alone and struggling with life.

People band the ""timeless masterpiece"" title around a bit too much, but this is such a unique film on every level and has earned great respect among fans as a real cult classic. I remember the first time I watched this pondering just how tedious could a film be about a Taxi Driver? Well this is no ordinary cab ride a gritty street/crime drama that leaves a lasting impression on viewers.

Probably the most powerful film both men have made",1413849600,,4323,4.4910941475826975
12823,5,0767830555,Classic!,1412812800,,8,8.0
12824,5,0767830555,"The same team that told us the true, demented story of Jake LaMotta (RAGING BULL), the fictionalized version of a hopeless, depressed, burned-out paramedic's life (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and, in what some view as a high success and others a low failure, Gnostic church doctrine (THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST), gave us, in the very beginning, a powerful, gripping psychological thriller that takes you into the mind and life of a psychopath--TAXI DRIVER. As far as Martin Scorsese's psychological work is concerned, what SHUTTER ISLAND is to him and Leonardo DiCaprio, TAXI DRIVER is to him and Robert De Niro.

In his sophomore collaboration with Scorsese (following their beloved 1973 classic MEAN STREETS), De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a twenty-six year old honorably discharged Vietnam War veteran. Ever since coming home from Vietnam, Travis has lived the Hell that is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and in no way has he continued forward in the same honorable service he gave his country when in `Nam. Rather, ever since returning home to America (home being New York City), Travis has, when not driving a checkered taxi, been spending time in porn theaters and keeping a diary of all the disturbances that have turned him into a psychopath.

And, in just a short matter of time, this same psychopath will make his ""second coming."" After girlfriend Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) leaves Travis following his taking her out to a date to a pornographic film, his new focus becomes Iris (Jodie Foster), a teenage child prostitute estranged from her parents and being used, manipulated, even treated like a slave and underage lover by her pimp Matthew ""Sport"" Higgins (Harvey Keitel). Travis may be Iris' only ""hope,"" but with Travis being a psychopath, can we really trust that Iris' best interests are truly at heart?

That, right there, is the beauty of TAXI DRIVER--its psychology. You can look at it from the viewpoint of a psychopath or, in a less intense light, a narcissist: one who is suffering, suffering having brought that psychopath/narcissist to such a point, and, while trying to rescue Iris, going on many more ""adventures"" that, for the purpose of film, serve as successful convolutions. Martin Scorsese, with the same gift of the late Stanley Kubrick (RIP, having the directing skills to personally immerse viewers inside his films), applies the same gift to his direction of TAXI DRIVER: most notably with up close and personal shots inside Travis Bickle's apartment, for example, which make us uncomfortable, but are exactly what we want to see as far as knowing what is going on inside Travis' head: which is EXACTLY what Scorsese, along with De Niro in his performance and Paul Schrader in his screenplay, reveal to us.

Of course, in the ending, we do see the true core of the truth with a psychopath/narcissist: if they give you a gift, you will pay three times more for it than what it is worth. At first, Travis Bickle is REWARDED for his ""actions"" that prove him to be a psychopath/narcissist and this same truth about him does not show him being held accountable. The ending, while I will not spoil it, saves this from being taken any farther (pay close, close attention all the way to the very last credit--and I mean the very last credit), and the intention--challenging Americans to think about the way society rewards such villains (in the case of a fictional character like Travis Bickle, antiheroes) like the would-be assassins of President Ford who, after nearly making America suffer through another tragedy, ended up on the cover of Time Magazine (one of the special features confirms this)!--has a great message and purpose to it, even if young people of this generation will not be able to recall it.

Ah, yes: the special features. A great many of them are present to the wealth and entertainment of fans of both TAXI DRIVER and Martin Scorsese alike. Listed below:

-COMMENTARY BY PAUL SCHRADER: Schrader discusses TAXI DRIVER, both the writing and the filming of it.

-COMMENTARY BY PROFESSOR ROBERT KOLKER: Professor Kolker discusses TAXI DRIVER from a psychological angle, helping ALL viewers understand the film better and giving a particular fascinating understanding to psychology and film buffs as well.

-MARTIN SCORSESE ON TAXI DRIVER: Scorsese talks about how he became involved with TAXI DRIVER, making the film, and fun facts such as who he chose to succeed Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle when De Niro was not available for filming--and who it was who turned him down before De Niro came back.

-PRODUCING TAXI DRIVER: A look into the making of TAXI DRIVER, the same gift being present with, essentially, a back-to-back documentary entitled MAKING OF DOCUMENTARY.

-GOD'S LONELY MAN: Paul Schrader and Robert Kolker discuss the psychology of Travis Bickle's loneliness, seen throughout the film, as Schrader talks about the life of melancholy he lived when he began writing TAXI DRIVER.

-INFLUENCE AND APPRECIATION: Tribute is paid to Martin Scorsese and TAXI DRIVER by cast members such as Robert De Niro and Peter Boyle (right on the set of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND) and, among others, acclaimed filmmaker Oliver Stone: who believes he was a model for Travis Bickle!

-TAXI DRIVER STORIES: Stories from real taxi drivers in New York City, to show what cab driving in NYC is really like as it is shown in TAXI DRIVER--with many similarities!

-TRAVIS' NEW YORK and TRAVIS' NEW YORK LOCATIONS show--with great depth from late NYC mayor Ed Koch (RIP)--what NYC was like when TAXI DRIVER was filmed and what it is like today, this special edition DVD having been released in 2006.

To top it off, you have storyboard to film comparisons (preceded with an introduction from Martin Scorsese), Animated Photo Galleries, and the original screenplay!

There you have it. All you Scorsese/De Niro/Schrader/psychology buffs, TAXI DRIVER is a must-see film and this is a must-have DVD.",1411776000,,5926,5.008130081300813

12838,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver features one of Robert DeNiro's finest performances as the sociopathic Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who observes the seamy side of society as he drives his taxi through the streets of New York.  It is a rich character study of an isolated and alienated man whose disgust with the filth he sees, both through his windshield and inside his cab, drives him to the edge.  Supporting roles are excellent as well, with Jodie Foster as the young prostitute he tries to save and Cybill Shepherd as the campaign worker who is the object of his well meaning but perversely misguided advances.  Travis is a man rebuked in his attempts to ""help"" these women and ultimately compelled to act out his frustrations in a kind of violent revolt.  Martin Scorsese plays on the cynical mood of the country following the Vietnam war and in the aftermath of Watergate.  This is not a movie of black and white contrasts but of shades of gray.  Like any great film, it bears repeated viewings to uncover small details and interesting tidbits about Travis' state of mind.  DeNiro is able to reveal Travis' thoughts with just an expression or a body movement - it truly is an amazing piece of acting.  Credit Scorsese for creating the visuals that reveal an uneasy atmosphere that keeps the viewer squirming, as if we are inside Travis' head seeing what he is seeing.  The film benefits greatly from the controversial and ambiguous ending that leaves viewers having to decide for themselves what kind of a person Travis really is: a hero or a disturbed individual, or maybe a disturbed hero. One can gain a feeling of satisfaction with Taxi Driver as an intense character study that still rings true today, even if not leaving a good taste in the mouth.",1410566400,,1739,4.712871287128713

12846,3,0767830555,"""To some, Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's perception of hell-as a crazed taxi driver's vision of New York City-was brilliant. To us, this gory cold-blooded story of sick mans lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming."" (Leonard Maltin's Movie Review).

Maltin only gave the movie Two Stars out of Four Stars. In my opinion that's much too low. I will say this: I don't see this movie as Five Stars out of Five Stars or even Four Stars. I give it a solid Three Stars. I liked much of Schrader's script, because he encapsulated NYC perfectly for the time period. In a way I'm glad that I never saw the film before three days ago. It allowed me to go back in time and see things in the city for the way they once were. New York was bankrupt at the time and quite dirty. Harlem was getting worse before it was going to get better and the porn shops had already metastasized in the Manhattan downtown area. This was the world that Bickel was thrown into after Vietnam.

What's so interesting is how by the end of the film Bickel goes from being a zero to a hero and that was not even his true intent! His madness begins to exhibit itself when he stalks Cybil Sheppard's character at the beginning of the movie. The supporting characters are solid. But why Foster was given top billing when her character is only in the movie for less than five minutes' screen time in the first hour of the film is beyond me. Sheppard was the more logical choice for top billing in my opinion.

Paul Schrader has been a master at describing the lonely and disconnected man in his movies. American Gigolo and Light Sleeper are quite similar films and deal with men who are loners and have very little going for them in society save for their jobs. Those two films had more soul than this film. In Taxi Driver, despite the top notch performances, I feel that something was missing from the script. Many of the supporting characters were too laconic. Others were too loquacious in my opinion. But I admit that I probably need to see the movie again to understand it better. I might put it at Three and a Half Stars, but for the moment it is a solid Three Star rating. I marginally recommend this film because of the great Paul Schrader's screenplay and Martin Scorsese's fantastic direction. This was my 260th Amazon review.

12874,3,0767830555,"Don't get me wrong -- I LOVE the film. It's a classic of the mid-1970s and defined (and capped off) the era of the independent spirit of Hollywood (captured in Peter Biskind's book, EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS. Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovich, Spielberg, Lukas, Rafaelson, Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty, and even Jack Nicholson brought a European sensibility to Hollywood during the late 60s and early 70s. In some ways, TAXI DRIVER (1976) represented the end of that era, even as JAWS (released the year before) signaled the new direction Hollywood would go in -- and still goes in -- to the great detriment of American film. Thank goodness for the Indies!

My problem with this disk is that, in order to fit the 4K transfer on it, they had to drop all the extras that appear on the ""standard"" blu-ray of the film. I don't have a 4K television, and I imagine you would only see the difference on a VERY large television or in a theater auditorium. I'd rather have the extras -- even though I'm a perfectionist when it comes to picture and sound. Get the 4K if you have a 4K television and it really makes a difference to you. The extras are pretty good and I'm glad I returned this disk and got the other one (with an almost identical cover).",1405209600,4,1235,4.538116591928251

This in spite of the fact that I have always been able to view the TV shows in HD without an issue.

Then a couple of months ago this error message stopped and I have since purchased and viewed several movies in HD without issue.  So I purchased this in HD.  I watched about half of it then when I went back to finish it I can't watch it in HD and I get the same old garbage about my PC not being ""compatible"".  Same with all the other HD movies I have even though I have already watched most of them in HD on my non-compatible device.  What is up with all that?

About this movie:

I first saw this a couple of years ago and purchased the DVD.  The music and photography is great at setting a mood and showing the streets of the city at night.  This flick launched De Niro into super-stardom and he would go on to appear in a lot of other movies including Cape Fear.  (Which I purchased in HD but now can also not watch due to the strange behavior of the streaming delivery system.)  As far as a message or moral to the story I don't really see one just a guy going off his nut and shooting people that he thinks are evil and deserve it.

A slow and boring movie that has no equivalent in France than the Samurai of JP Melville. Because yes! behind this slow and strange rhythm that is all oriented towards the final action lies a complex screenplay with a strong message extremely provocative !

So according to Mr Schrader it's like if Travis had more or less missed his real target by attacking the pimps. We could go further and say outright that real prostitutes are not the ones we think and the woman of the world ...

De Niro's eyes in the rearview mirror at the end of the film give us the strange feeling that the killer still doesn't understand the gravity of his action but he would even be ready to start again in devilishly gigantic proportions.

Also, this is so cleaned up, it takes the grittiness out of the print, and hurts some of the character of the film.

Seeing ""Taxi Driver"" after such a long time really took me by surprise. Sure I remembered the 'classic' scenes and lines (""You talkin' to me?""), but there were so many other things that I had outright forgotten. Such as: how Travis (played by incredibly young--and skinny--Robert de Niro) finally manages to get a date with the woman of his dreams Betsy (played by incredible young--and beautiful--Cybill Shepherd), only to then promptly ruin it by taking her to the ""movies"". Or Travis' utter paranoia (when flowers intended for Betsy are returned to his apartment, he is overwhelmed by the smell and he worries that ""I think I've got stomach ache""). Or the rather uplifting ending of the movie, which also came as a surprise. Other things that stuck out are that this movie is now a time capsule of New York 1975. It is astonishing to see in what terrible shape New York then was. Really enjoyed the score of Bernard Hermann. I had bought the soundtrack CD some years ago just for that (it also contains some of de Niro's musings seen in the movie).

As to the Blu-ray edition: the colors are quite nice but since most of the movie plays out at night, there isn't as much opportunity for the color to truly shine (compare that to, for example, the Blu-ray for the 50th anniversary of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", which I also recently bought here). As to the bonus materials, there is so much of them that it's almost overwhelming. I enjoyed sampling them. The ""Making of Documentary"" is my favorite of the bunch, but there are many, many others. It also includes 12 supersize postcards with stills from the movie. Not really sure what to do with them once you've looked at them once. But bottom line is that ""Taxi Driver"" remains an outstanding, if divisive/controversial, movie but with the passage of time I can only see the legacy of this movie grow in stature. If you are a movie buff, this is a ""can't miss"". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374624000,9,2157,4.6

The story opens with a Vietnam vet, Travis Bickle (De Niro) who takes a job as a taxi driver. Travis is a quiet and lonely man who is turned off by the scum and filth he sees on the streets of New York. He becomes enthralled with a beautiful campaign worker who eventually turns him off. Then he also comes in contact with a young girl who makes her living working the streets. His frustration deepens and he begins to work out and collect weapons. It becomes obvious he is about to explode and after an initial failed attempt he does  just that. However, ironically the aftermath leaves him as a hero. Travis is an interesting character because you feel sorry for him and yet he does things that are truly wrong.

13037,3,0767830555,"This was the first time I have ever watched TAXI DRIVER. Even though I've become a true movie buff / entrepreneur, I realize that sometimes it's better to never watch these ""classic"" films and simply imagine what they were like in its place and time, than watching them nowadays for the first time with expectations that won't deliver the goods. There are so many of my favorites that came from this time (the 60's) in film history. But the catch is I watched them back then, which makes me appreciate them more now, rather than watching them now, which appreciates me back then. Am I saying that TAXI DRIVER is a bad film? Not exactly.  Did I really watch this movie? Indubitably!

The best part about this flick was seeing younger versions of Rupert Da Nero, Harvey Guitar and Jody ""Cannon"" Fodder. It's been awhile since I've seen Cyborg Sheepherder too, apparently she's been packing on the chunks over the years, but I haven't seen her myself. It was also great to see Peter Boppins (may he nap peacefully) but I'm beginning to wonder if the man ever had a full skull of working hair follicles. I love Skadaisy's work and own nearly two of his films on HD-DVD. There's no question that what he and Da Nero created here was pure brilliance at the time and again, had I watched this film way back when I was born, I would've understood this stuff much more clearly, but in this day and age a lot about the film just isn't relevant anymore (At one point the guy pays a prostitute with just a twenty dollar bill! The movie about lost me here).

A couple of positive things that really stood out in the movie were the relationship between ""Slick"" Travis and Ole' Bootsy and the conversation that took place between Travis and the secret service ""dude"" in Las Vegas. With Travis and Bootsy, well, most people would call Travis a clear-cut hopeless romantic and some of his more colourful ideas he shares with her certainly show this. But this brings me to my first issue, the dude's an underdog taxi driver and she's a successful geologist with options, I just don't see that combo ever cutting the slice. And who in their right mind takes a high society chick (or any chick) around town in a taxi on their first date? But I will say that taking her to a dirty movie was a classy move on his part, even thought she wasn't getting into it like he was. And as for the secret service guy, why did he wait so long to try and apprehend Travis? Red flags galore were going off during their poker game, more than enough to get a dude shot in the face these days, and considering how he gave the guy his real name (Henry Krinckle) and what I think was his real address (123 Fake Street), I don't understand why they weren't beating down his door with handcuffs and tasers.

TAXI DRIVER is an interesting love story, although our main protagonist is clearly supposed to be a likeable character, I had a hard time rooting for him, let alone understanding how things managed to keep working out in his favor throughout the film (except the ending, he totally got what he deserved). I do think they captured the loneliness of working in a factory right on the money, but as far as Travis being a war veteran, well I wasn't completely sold on that. The Hurt Locker was the best journey into the unstable mind of Vietnam Vets for me and I just didn't think Travis came off as that type of person. I will say this though, that all out b/a/l/l/s-to-the-walls dance off at the end was totally awesome. Hip-yeah!

13048,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver follows Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a lonely and depressed taxi driver, as his character deteriorates due to disappointment after disappointment in his own life and his frustration with the harsh world around him. Taxi Driver delves deep into the mind of the lonely and misunderstood.

Taxi Driver has a deep and thought-provoking storyline- a story that many can relate to because of its realism and accuracy. In my opinion, the story is really about a character that is lonely and misunderstood; I'm sure others will find different themes in this film, and that's okay because film will be interpreted differently by different people. Much of the film intensely builds up to a stunning climax, and it works well. The ending of the film is darkly ironic, and I liked it; however, I won't comment further to avoid spoiling it. It's a great story that manages to send significant messages without sacrificing entertainment. Robert De Niro as Travis was spectacular; he really captured this character; the rest of the cast was also amazing.

I own the Blu-Ray of this film. It is a digibook case that comes with one blu-ray disc, and several picture-cards. The picture and sound quality on this disc are superb; definitely a high-quality master similar to the high quality ""Blade Runner"" and ""Psycho"" transfers. A must-own blu-ray for fans of this film and film collectors that want the definitive version.

Overall, Taxi Driver is a compelling psychological drama/thriller; whether you're looking for entertainment or a film with a deep message, this film delivers. I highly recommend a purchase.

13051,4,0767830555,"There are already hundreds of opinions and interpretations of the film, its acting, directing and influences via film noir, so I will dispense with those and focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray

Once you get past the first few scenes displayed as gritty and grainy as the characters of the film, you are presented with a stunning transfer of the video to BluRay and your home screen.  The film must have been remastered as my Standard Def version doesn't look nearly as good.  The colors of the city, the skin tones and contrast are all beautifully rendered for your home theater.  The whites appear as if they were 95 IRE and really brings home the excellent contrast on this blu ray version.  Once past those opening scenes where the grain and grit is clearly deliberate,  there are no artifacts or ghosting of any kind and no noticeable or distracting grain that wasn't meant to be there.  5 Stars for the movie and 5 stars for the video transfer to Blu Ray.

The Audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio clearly makes a heck of a difference.  All audio levels are nicely balanced and the dialogue doesn't fight with the musical score which is mostly a soft jazz.  The score is very nicely spread across the front stage and the separation of instruments is in a very comfortable stereo spread.  The audio of the film is the only reason why I dropped this film down a star to 4.  There is no use of your rear channels or even the front left and right channels, nor your sub LFE channel at all.  Even during the shooting scene at the movie's end, where a gun shot should have been placed via a discreet channel, all the action, all the dialogue and all, except for the jazz score, is coming down your center channel.  Not clear on why they did not use any directionality for the many foley effects but that is the only negative.

There are more extras with this Blu Ray than you can sit through at one time tho I did sit through many.  The BR also contains all the extras that were on the original release plus lots more including several still shots on a nice quality paper with the DVD's case.

While I might not watch this film again for another year, I am very glad to have the upgrade to Blu Ray as it is heads and tails superior to the Standard Def version I bought a few years ago, plus, you can't beat the inexpensive price.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

13093,5,0767830555,"Directed by Martin Scorsese from Paul Schrader's semi-autobiographical script, TAXI DRIVER is depicts the emotional struggles of an self-isolated loser who through some cosmic joke becomes a hero after he attacks and murders three lowlifes. This when Travis Bickle's irrational plan to assassinate a presidential candidate at one of his rallies is thwarted by watchful Secret Service men.

With nothing to fill his days with, ex-Vietnam vet Bickle accepts an overnight cabbie job that guarantees him very long hours. Unlike his fellow drivers, Travis is willing to take fares to the most dangerous areas of NYC. His brief friendship with an attractive gal ends badly and her rebuff sends him into a downward spiral of isolation and obsessive dreams of revenge against the decadent city he chooses to wander through. These sociopathic impulses play out in a most dramatic and explosive fashion.

Ultimately, Travis appears to come out intact: calmer, seemingly sane, but one is left to wonder if he'll kill again someday.

An undeniable modern classic and a chilling reflection of its bleak time. Features Bernard Herrmann's last film score, a darkly brooding jazz suite driven by saxman Tom Scott that nicely fits the story's mood.

We watch his sense of alienation grow as he descends into a kind of heroic madness.  He's that rare evil character that you actually find yourself rooting for, never mind that he's turned into a deranged sociopath.

Why not 5 stars?  There's some ridiculous editing in this film.  A lot of it is in the climactic shoot out.  Matthew, the scumbag pimp, takes a a bullet in the gut and returns several minutes later as fresh as a daisy wielding a .44 magnum and firing at De Niro.  There are some strange continuity issues as De Niro climbs the stairs surrounded by his rivals.  You kind of have to see it to understand.

Also, there's the famous final scene when Travis emerges as a hero.  It's likely that the dying Bickle fantasizes this whole scene, but that's never made clear to the audience.

Fastforward to today, the release day of the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray, and viola. I bought it, knowing how much I didn't like it before. I was willing to pay money for something I knew I didn't like, just to give it a second shot. So anyway, I rewatched it, and I actually got much more out of it the second time. Admittedly, I'll need to watch it again a third time (with Director Marty Scorsese and Writer Paul Schrader's 1986 Criterion Commentary) to fully understand what happened in Travis Bickle's (played to perfection by one of film history's greatest assets, Robert De Niro) mind. I mean, we all have our good times, and bad. Everybody has issues, and many people hate the scum that can be found on inner city streets late at night. Not many let it bother them so much that they go damn near insane and kill people. I know I'll catch a little flack for this statement because these films are held in such contrasting regards, but this story reminded me of Kick-Ass (or vice versa). A guy gets fed up, and fights crime, etc. So I will need to watch it a third time to fully grasp it, but even so, I recognize quality when I see it. This film deserves to be considered one of the greatest American works of art. Hats off to Scorsese, De Niro, Bernard Herrmann for the magnificent score, and most of all the scribe who penned the screenplay, Paul Schrader. My score may seem a bit low for all the praise I'm giving this film, but keep in mind that I didn't like it when I first saw it, so that score is quite a leap.

13135,5,0767830555,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a former Marine and a veteran of the Vietnam war. He frequently has trouble sleeping and is plagued by headaches. The pills he takes don't seem to help at all. Because he's likely to be awake all night anyway, Bickle takes a job driving a cab. He prefers the night shift.

Scorsese's version of New York is gritty and realistic. Most of the film is shot at night and we see just how crazy some of the people are. It's a crime-ridden world populated by junkies and prostitutes. Bickle hates how much scum exists in the city, and he's referring to the people more than the dirty streets.

Bickle is looking for something to brighten up his seedy existence and a woman catches his eye. Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) works in a local office for a senator who is hoping to become the next president. After pestering her for a while, she eventually agrees to go on a date with him. He talks to her in a very straightforward way. It's not clear whether he lacks intelligence, or if he doesn't see any point in hiding the truth about himself. His approach works and leads to one of the funniest scenes in the film when he takes her to see a movie.

Other things attract Bickle's attention. He's particularly drawn to Iris (Jodie Foster), who is a 12-year-old prostitute. As his frustration mounts at the disgusting state of the city, he begins to devise a plan to clean up one small part. An incident on the street gives him the idea of saving Iris from her situation and giving her the opportunity to escape from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).

It's interesting watching Bickle trying to escape his miserable existence. He figures out how to buy and use weapons and starts working out to strengthen his body. All the while, there's mounting tension, and we sense that Bickle is close to losing touch with reality completely.

The supporting cast is strong, with Shepherd, Foster and Keitel all playing their parts well. You'll also see Peter Boyle and Albert Brooks. One of the most surprising scenes involves a cameo from Scorsese. His character might even be the catalyst for the change which eventually occurs in Bickle.

I have to mention Scorsese's decision to shoot most of the scenes at night. It was an inspired choice and adds so much atmosphere to the film. Bernard Herrmann's saxophone-heavy score is also an important part of the mix and helps helps transport us into Bickle's troubled world.

De Niro has produced some incredible performances over the past 40 years and Travis Bickle is probably my favorite De Niro character. There's so much going on beneath the surface and De Niro portrays much of it with his body language.

The meaning of the conclusion is open to debate, but if you take it purely at face value, it's quite uplifting.

13168,5,0767830555,"Taxi driver is a fascinating movie, coming out in the same year as Star Wars (1976) but showing a far bleaker view of life. Travis is a New York City taxi driver, an ex-marine, who is struggling with insomnia and just wants to get through the day. He takes on driving a taxi in the worst areas of town. He has people throwing bottles at him, being sexual in his back seats, and his view on humanity gets fairly worn down. The movie is chock-full of hard street language. He throws around slurs about African-Americans and women, and he clearly has some negative opinions about both. He first stalks a blonde, and when she gets upset that he takes her to a triple-X movie he's baffled and then hostile. He then focuses on a young hooker.

It was interesting, while watching this I kept thinking of ""Network"" with its ""angry man not wanting to take it any more"" theme - and sure enough both came out in the same year and Network swept many of the awards Taxi Driver was up for. This must have been quite a year for angry people. It's fascinating to me that we have Star Wars on one hand, and Taxi Driver on the other.

One of the most classic lines coming out of this film is De Niro staring in the mirror, gearing up with his guns, snarling, ""Are you talking to me?""

Certainly the actors did a fantastic job here. You really do feel that you're immersed in New York City, walking the streets, immersed in the harsh characters that can populate the world. I admit it's hard for me to watch some of the overtly racist scenes, with him glaring at African-Americans, with the slurs that are passed. But I also understand that this is a ""documentary"" of sorts of how things were for some people, and there is some context with how he was abused by those around him. Not that it makes it ""right"" of course, but it was the way things were for some people.

I also enjoyed that the script was not telegraphed. There were many points that I had no idea at all where the story would go - would he do X or Y? I had to sit and wait and see how it all unfolded.

Not a movie I would watch repeatedly - but definitely a movie I am glad I watched once, to get a sense of that era in history, and to understand more the references that others make to this film.

Note that this movie fails the Bechdel test. While there are two named female characters (and really, only those two) they never interact at all. They are simply there to present ""beautiful pure angel female"" and ""run down whore female in need of rescuing"". That's the range of women in Travis's mind.",1324512000,2,2548,4.286902286902287
13169,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" is a psychological thriller film where the viewer stands in the shoes of deluded Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro. Bickle presents as a social misfit who is looking for a job to fill his sleepless nights. His reality is certainly skewed as he takes a potential girlfriend, Betsy, to a pornographic movie screening as a first date. From Bickle's point of view the decay of society surrounds him, and he seeks to rid the city of seedy elements. Iris, a child prostitute, becomes a reason for him to carry out his plan, and she in many ways is an important focus in his life. De Niro convincingly plays Bickle with a deadpan persona that is driven purely by an invented concept of right and wrong.

13170,5,0767830555,"Yep, that's right, I think this is Martin Scorcese's best movie.  Even better than Goodfellas, Casino, or Raging Bull (all fantastic movies, mind you).

I first came across Taxi Driver back in December of 2006 when it was on AMC, and while I only caught about the last 60% of the movie, I was captivated by the gritty cinematography and central character, Travis Bickle.  It wasn't long before I requested it as a Christmas gift, and this is one Christmas gift that hasn't been returned or will ever be returned.

STORY

The story for Taxi Driver is centered around Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), a lonely and socially-isolated man honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, who takes a job as a taxi driver because of his chronic insomnia (his motto is ""If I can't sleep, I might as well get paid for it."").  As time progresses, Travis becomes increasingly disgusted with the ""scum"" infesting the streets of New York City, and hopes to ""make a difference"" one day.  In his life, he hopes to bond with a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shephard), whom he considers ""an angel in a city of filth,"" and later gets involved with a young prostitute named Iris (played by a then 12 year-old Jody Foster) and her slimy pimp, Matt (Harvey Keitel).

CHARACTERS

Taxi Driver only has one highly-developed character, and that's Travis.  I don't really see this as a problem since like the Michael Caine masterpiece Get Carter (1971), Taxi Driver is really all about Travis.  Travis isn't a really a guy to look up to (he's a sociopath), but at the same time, his darker qualities aren't at all forced.  Probably because of the Vietnam War, Travis is socially-detached from everyone else, and it really shows when he tries to establish a romantic relationship with Betsy.  His relationship ends pretty swiftly when he takes her to a porn theater, thinking that when she said ""go to the movies,"" that she'd want to see those types of films (Travis frequently goes to these theaters, and isn't too familiar with ""regular"" movies).  Because NYC is infamous for crime (especially during the time it was set and filmed, which was 1976), Travis's disgust with the slimy people walking the streets is totally understandable.  Travis's character is also very creative, because when he plans out his ""finest hour"" near the end of the movie, you see him take apart the railings from a shelf and lamp, to create a sliding mechanism on his right arm that pops out a gun from under his sleeve.

The supporting cast is in top form as well.  Shepard does a great job as Betsy, and despite Travis's eventual disillusionment with her and his conclusion of her being ""just like all the others,"" we can't really look down upon her for leaving him.  Foster did a great job with her role as Iris, as she really wants out of her deplorable life, but is also afraid to leave, and shows this by pretending to like the life she has.  Keitel is excellent as Matt since he's a slimy pimp, but his character doesn't seem forced at all.  While his appearance was small, Peter Boyle was great as ""the Wizard,"" a seasoned cabbie whom the other cabbies Travis hangs around with seek knowledge and interesting stories about the business.

SETTING

New York City circa the 1970's was the perfect setting for this movie, since as stated before, the 70's was a decade of crime and NYC is known for lots of crime.  The cinematography was top-notch as well, as it captured all the filthiest corners of the city, helping to flesh out Travis's resentment of the ""filth"" infesting the city.  Also, with this being a movie made 35 years ago, the film's age shows in the picture quality, giving it a naturally-grainy look to it.

SOUNDTRACK

Bernard Herrmann made a fantastic soundtrack for this movie.  The main theme is loaded with dread, and perfectly matches the tone of the movie.  The other for the movie also breath life into it, almost making a snapshot of what NYC was like in the 70's.

MATURE CONTENT

This isn't a movie for the kids because it rightly deserves its R-rating.  Towards the end, there's a good deal of brutal violence and even before that, there's a good deal of salty language (some of it is strongly sexual) and when Travis goes to the porn theaters in two scenes, there's footage of the erotic movies he's watching (one of them being the Swedish sexual film, Language of Love).  Not to spoil any parts of the film containing the brutal violence, there's one scene where a man gets his hand blown off with a .44 magnum, and it's not pretty.

FINAL WORD

For once, I agree with most critics with their assertion on a ""classic"" movie.  Taxi Driver is truly a masterpiece in the psychological-thriller genre, and I think it's Scorcese's crowning jewel.  If you want a classic film with an excellent portrayal of a sociopath in a city of slime on the verge of madness, then this movie is a must-watch.",1324425600,2,4865,4.662368112543962

13174,5,0767830555,"Time will tell you lies -- or at least distort things if you're not careful. With films, especially, this can be true; I've recently watched a few films that I saw in my youth and liked to see if they could stand up to scrutiny in middle age -- and most of them didn't.

Some exceptions: ""Jaws,"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and ""Taxi Driver.""

I may get some argument on this, but I think ""Taxi Driver"" might be Martin Scorsese's greatest work. It has everything -- a great plot, incredible acting, and despite it being a harrowing, dark film, it has elements that are eye and ear candy. Especially ear candy: ""Taxi Driver"" and Brian de Palma's ""Obsession"" were the last two scores from the great Bernard Hermann, who had written so many incredible pieces for Alfred Hitchcock. Hermann's work on ""Taxi Driver"" really helps ratchet up the tension, and does so without being especially ""edgy"" or, worse yet, pretentious. From blaring brass to softer woodwinds to, at times, just a simple percussive beat, the music helps draw you into main character Travis Bickle's lonely, twisted world.

Of course, it's also easier to make a great film when you have great actors, and Scorsese really had them on this shoot, including Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Cybill Shepherd, and Peter Boyle as Wizard, another whacked-out cabbie who at first seems just sane enough to try to mentor Travis -- until you realize that, despite his ""Wizard"" moniker, there's just no ""there"" there.

The ending of this film will haunt me forever. And each time I see it, it seems to play differently. THAT is art -- any work that seems to reveal more of itself to you, every time you read, hear or see it.",1321747200,7,1711,4.674418604651163
13175,5,0767830555,"This film comes from the 1970s auteur period of nakedly awful stories about the dregs and losers.  I remember enjoying my reaction to this as an undergraduate, the way that it kind of freaked me out, which is a substitute for experience in the young.  This time around, while I recognize its significance, fine acting, and relentless realism, I half wondered why I was putting myself through it.  OK, you endure it for the sake of art, but it is so awful that I may never do so again, which leads to the question, why buy it?

Scorsese, DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster completely deserve the praise they received.  They portray losers in the drama of a massive, then-deteriorating city, in which a man is going insane.  He pulls Keitel and Foster into his web of horror and alienation with the surety of a pendulum, to the unspeakable violence of the climax.  It is painful to watch:  a horrible story about horrible people to whom horrible things will happen.  Then there is the commentary on the media:  Travis becomes a hero by his action, though it is clear the pendulum continues to swing.

There is also a very good documentary about the film.  It is a must for Scorsese fans and Taxi buffs.

Directed by Martin Scorsese from Paul Schrader's semi-autobiographical script, TAXI DRIVER is depicts the emotional struggles of an self-isolated loser who through some cosmic joke becomes a hero after he attacks and murders three lowlifes. This when Travis Bickle's irrational plan to assassinate a presidential candidate at one of his rallies is thwarted by watchful Secret Service men.

With nothing to fill his days with, ex-Vietnam vet Bickle accepts an overnight cabbie job that guarantees him very long hours. Unlike his fellow drivers, Travis is willing to take fares to the most dangerous areas of NYC. His brief friendship with an attractive gal ends badly and her rebuff sends him into a downward spiral of isolation and obsessive dreams of revenge against the decadent city he chooses to wander through. These sociopathic impulses play out in a most dramatic and explosive fashion.

Ultimately, Travis seems to come out intact: calmer, seemingly sane, but one is left to wonder if he'll kill again someday.

An undeniable modern classic and a chilling reflection of its bleak time. Features Bernard Herrmann's last film score, a darkly brooding jazz suite driven by saxman Tom Scott that nicely fits the story's mood.

Non-spoiler synopsis: Travis Bickle (De Niro) is a heavy drinking, pill popping night shift taxi driver living a solitary existence and suffering from insomnia who will drive anyone anywhere. He wears a paratrooper style jacket with a faded ""Bickle"" on the back. He is not exactly a dullard, but has real trouble properly reading social situations and has a childlike quality about him. When he speaks with 12 year old Iris (Jodi Foster), for example, they interact almost like peers. Travis is clearly unbalanced, but it's not clear whether this is from war trauma or birth. He keeps a journal and narrates throughout. As time goes on the viewer is drawn into his reality and desire to act to ""clean up"" the filth (literal and figurative) rather than being a passive observer of it.

Always gritty looking detail has been improved and colors look extremely good here. This is a large improvement over the previous DVD edition of the film. At first the film appears a bit dicey when the Columbia logo rolls up on screen but the film improves markedly by the first couple of minutes.

Offered in a hardcover book style with a replica of the original poster artwork as well as photos from the movie. Special features include the 1986 commentary track with Scorsese and Schrader from the Criterion laserdisc, an interactive feature that allows you to compare the script to the movie(the script appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen as you're watching the movie progressing with each new scene). It's interesting to compare the finished movie where the actors and Scorsese alter the dialogue to fit the their interpretation of the characters. We also get new commentary tracks by writer Schrader and Professor Robert Kolker. We also get new featurettes including ""God's Lonely Man"", ""Producing 'Taxi Driver'"", ""Travis' New York"" comparing 1975 to 2006, storyboard to film comparisons with Scorsese's introduction  and Scorsese discussing the making of the film. I didn't access the ""Movie I.Q."" special feature here.

Shot on a very low budget (less than $1.5 million)and originally slated for director Brian DePalma (who ended up tackling ""Obsession"" also from a script by ""Taxi Driver"" writer Paul Schrader which also featured Bernard Herrmann writing the score), ""Taxi Driver"" became Scorsese and Schrader's first great film. It's fascinating to watch the script-to-screen comparison which illustrates the artistry of writer, actors and director bring to the project making it quite unique.

Albert Brooks who makes his film debut here improvised his dialogue as his character wasn't all that fleshed out in the script. He's also quite amusing in a very dark disturbing film. Scorsese makes his debut here as an actor as well when the actor who was originally cast couldn't do the role due to an injury (he appears twice in the film you can also glimpse him sitting on the curb outside the campagin office in the beginning of the film). It's also pretty interesting watching Bickle's reaction to Scorsese's rant and who he considers to be, well, more disturbed than HIM.

Bernard Herrmann's moving, powerful score sounds absolutely lovely here.

Scorsese and Scharder's powerful glimpse into the mind of an alienated and disturbed lonely man trying to connect with others and finding the only way to do so is the murderous ramapage to ""wash away the flith"" continues to resonate today.

""Taxi Driver"" on Blu-ray is HIGHLY recommended.",1306454400,3,2812,5.126637554585153

Anyone who has experienced the loneliness and isolation that Travis Buckle lives with in this film is bound to find something to connect to.

The Blu-ray is simply astounding. I've pirchased this on DVD twice before; the original 1999 Columbia release and the 2006(?) 2-disc release. The latter was a vast improvement on an already decent transfer, but the Blu-ray bests any and all previous formats.

13224,5,0767830555,"TAXI DRIVER is an iconic film, considered by many to be a masterpiece and the crowning achievement of both Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro.  Whatever your opinion this is a powerful film that starts strong and never lets up that has also stood the test of time.  Everything in the movie is done so realistically that the story could still be told today.  Robert  Deniro plays Travis.  We know little about him other than that he is an ex marine and a deep insomniac.  He also sees the world as a dirty place that needs to be cleaned up.  He becomes a taxi driver in the city of New York which takes on a realistic role of its own here.  We see the two sides of everything and the same goes for New York.  Nothing is held back on showing the realistic gritty underside of the city.

But what of the transfer of this movie classic to blu ray.  Seems like all the classics are being brought to blu ray, some more succesfully than others.  The questions are always how does it look, is it an improvement over the dvd and does it bring the film to new life.  TAXI DRIVER was the first film to receive an enhanced 4k restoration and what it does is perform magic on a decades old film.  The video presentation is purely amazing.  It is funny for when the film starts the Columbia logo is very fuzzy and then the movie starts.  It is clear, crisp with colors strong.  The film is very definitive in that scenes are either nighttime or daytime, dark or light.  The blacks and dark colors are brilliant and all color ratios amazing.  Whites contrast perfectly.  No matter what the scene everything pops.  The night scenes are very realistic and when colors are introduced they are vibrant and real.  Nothing is overenhanced.  Instead the film looks the way it must have when released originally in theaters.  It is leaps and bounds over any dvd version.  The climactic scene at the end is brought to new devastating life with this new restoration.  Flesh tones are also perfect.  Blu ray is put to amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory.  The graininess here is meant to be here.  It represents New York City in full detail.  And the audio is just as perfect.  The DTS 5.1 audio allows the amazing soundtrack to fully blossom and soar over the entire film.  The score here tells the story as much as any character or visual.  And dialogue is strong and present.  Nothing is wrong here.  The film itself is told in a way that it is open to many different interpretations but the blu ray itself needs no debate.  It is spectacular.  I will reiterate again.  The film looks as pure and original as when in the theaters restored to its true glory.  Do not hesitate to double dip if you own the dvd.  This blu ray shows the movie as a whole new experience.  I give this blu ray my highest recommendations.",1305331200,7,2816,4.41130604288499

The Blu-ray edition delivers the goods with smooth menus, loads of interesting features, and the Sony 4K restoration process is evident, not some corporate bull advertising to get you to buy yet another edition of a classic film.  The picture quality is pure eye candy for those who have seen previous disc versions.  The only disappointment is that the restoration process did not include ""fixing"" the final bit of violence at the end. Without spoiling the plot I will say that the ending violence was supposed to be vibrant, not washed over in an orange hue as it was upon original release and is in this 4K restoration.  In any case, this should not deter anyone from picking up this Blu-ray.  This is the definitive edition and should not be missed.",1304726400,4,897,4.717948717948718

De Niro's performance is a standout, but all the actors play their parts extremely well. It's hard to come away unaffected by Taxi Driver, and to me that's the mark of a great film.

13238,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie. The script is audacious, the cinematography is in your face and gritty, and Robert De Niro's holds up the movie on his very own.

Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi driving nobody who has served in a Vietnam and goes to pornographic movie theaters, making small talk with the woman who sells the food and candy. The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with ""trash"". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story.

13239,5,0767830555,"As we all know,  a film's critical review is a subjective journey.
Many have universally praised  Taxi Driver an American masterpiece.
In my humble opinion,  it is Scorsese's crowning achievement.
I won't bother you a with a critical review of the narrative itself,  the power of the performances, the lush cinematography not to mention the haunting soundtrack.

Lets get down to brass tacks with the  Blu-ray experience:

The new 4K transfer and remastering ( under cinematographer Michael Chapmen and Scorsese's supervision ) looks fantastic. I can only hope for more studios to take their time when transferring vintage masterpieces.  The clarity, color and detail even surpasses my last film-screening of this film at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome  in the mid-90s.  The soundtrack is presented in 5.1 DTS HD with wonderful results.

The special features are chock full of goodies, too numerous for me to list here fully:
I really enjoyed the ""screen to script interactive"", and also the ""storyboard to film comparisons"".  Multiple documentaries are included in this single BR disc, including ""Travis' New York "" The changes of New York 1975 to Today"" Multiple interviews and commentaries with both Scoreses and writer Paul Schrader + much more supplementary material.

 The Picture Quality at 1080P was like peanut butter to jelly on my 52"" LCD XBR,  and switching the images to a 150"" screen (  via Sony VPL-VW50 1080P projector ) was like adding a couple strips of crispy bacon to that peanut butter sandwich. If you are into HT and projection systems,  this BR disc is made for you.  Seeing New York City in the mid 70s presented in such detail and color was a visually arresting experience. The vibrant night shots really stays with you,  vivid colors pop during those long tracking POV shots from Travis's cab. A museum quality documentation on NYC street-life during that period.

The packaging is robust, with a 3 section pullout-type case that holds the bonus lobbycards.

This is the definitive copy.  ( at least until The  Criterion Collection decides to give it a BR go ).

Yes folks,  for a small price,  its time to get into Travis's Taxi for a cinematic ride like no other.",1301961600,110,2189,4.945054945054945

Gabrielle Giffords, unfolds like the keys you need to understand how something so horrible as an assassination happens. It is a profile in isolation, desperation, crisis of self-worth and the corrosive effects of an unhealthy society. You can see the trials of the misfit as he attempts to fit in with others and the deepening despair and feelings of insignificance that follow the failures. You can follow the logic trail to violence as expression of last resort. The arc of the storyline is so perfectly realized that the end feels almost tacked on, a throwaway comment on the attraction of manly, heroic violence that rings false, unless I'm misreading it. Either way, this is a storied and deservedly decorated piece of filmmaking, with brilliant turns by Robert DiNiro and Jodie Foster, and a great American director at or near the height of his powers.",1297814400,2,921,4.910256410256411

13244,4,0767830555,"'Taxi Driver' is a dark film looking at one mans alienation from society and life around him. It looks at how he gradually descends into his own form of madness and you really get a sense for how he feels through De Niros chilling portrayal. The lack of sleep and night shifts Travis (the main protagonist) works only serve to isolate him further from reality and life. When he meets a young political campaigner and a prostitute, both of these relationships spur him into dark action against the scum of new york. I have to say the direction and acting was excellent, you really get a feel for the malevolence Travis feels around him and his sense of disjointed exhaustion. The soundtrack is very dated now and the same jazzy refrain used throughout the film started to get on my nerves. It is a good film and definitely one to watch, but I have to say I was expecting so much more after all the hype on these pages and from things i've heard before that I was left a touch disappointed. The ending is powerful and then kind of fizzles out afterwards, you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Overall a good film and worth a viewing.

13261,5,0767830555,"Is there an American film more wrongly and regularly misinterpreted than Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, Taxi Driver? Not even 2001: A Space Odyssey, by Stanley Kubrick, nor Apocalypse Now, by Francis Ford Coppola, have been intellectually, politically, and critically twisted and turned away from what they really are- and this all aside and apart from the silly debates over art influencing real world violence after John W. Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, due to his own obsession with actress Jodie Foster. The film has been deconstructed and reconstructed (see references to Death Wish and The Searchers) according to prevailing political and artistic whims more than several times, and matters have been further complicated by the many claims of the film's protagonists, from screenwriter Paul Schrader (is there a better example of a filmic one hit wonder?), to director Scorsese, to star Robert De Niro, the claims and counterclaims about the film have devolved into legendry.

Taxi Driver was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost out to the formulaic boxer flick, Rocky, penned by Sylvester Stallone It did, however, win the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not only a great motion picture, but it is one of the best portraits of a character ever filmed, and Travis Bickle is one of the scariest characters in film history. Probably only Martin Landau's character, Judah Rosenthal, in Woody Allen's Crimes And Misdemeanors, is more truly horrifying (and certainly far more evil). But Bickle is every bit as scary, for he is far more unpredictable to those about him. Yes, he is not a cold blooded murderer, like Rosenthal, but he is certainly violent, and a racist- not of the KKK White Supremacist sort, but of the passive, scared little white boy sort; and much mileage has been gotten from the fact that the film's final shootout victims were all white, when in the original screenplay they had been all black (Scorsese and Schrader bowed to studio pressure to change that fact, because by not making a change, the beancounters claimed, the film might incite race riots, and lead to financial culpability). These elements are what make Bickle scary, and why he is so realistically portrayed. Yet, there is also the niggling truth even the film seems loath to admit, that Travis Bickle really and truly IS a hero, and not merely a crazed lunatic. Note that I wrote `not merely,' for this is an important point: because most critics resort to binary thought in such matters, that does not change the fact that Bickle is a dangerous and paranoid man and a hero; and these are not mutually opposing claims. And by `hero,' I mean it in the absolutely most sober sense of the word. Heroes are not perfect men, but they are real men (and women, of course). And heroes are not necessarily even ethically `good' men (imagine that!). But they are brave, they are determined, and they are relentless, in the pursuit of the goals, things, and people, they deem as good. But, most of all they are `real,' not like the fictive heroes that populate books and films, comic books and video games. And rarely has there ever been a more chillingly realistic portrayal of a hero in film than Travis Bickle. Now, do me the favor of not misinterpreting that, ok?",1283299200,,3326,4.897163120567376
13262,3,0767830555,"I decided I had to get this movie based on all of the hype of an Oscar winner and a De Niro defining role after hearing that my new boss was named Hinkley.  A co-worker asked if that was the same name as the man who attempted to assassinate Reagan.  After looking up the Reagan assassination attempt and finding out it was Hinckley, rather than Hinkley, I also re-learned about his obsession with Jodie Foster in this movie and how it led to the assassination attempt.  She won (I was going to say earned, but not so much) an Oscar for her role in this movie and it has become a ""modern classic"".

Overall, the story was nothing more than okay - a loner who is torn between his disgust of the seedier side of New York City and his inability to not be consumed by it.  His ""relationships"" with Cybill Shepard (very young and demure here) and Foster are at best superficial and barely explored.  The movie relies on a warped soundtrack that I was tempted to mute and go to subtitles because it was so annoying and the unusual cityscape of New York to propel it forward.  There was virtual no useful dialogue and none of the characters seemed to have any idea what they wanted or why they were where they were.

How Foster was even noticed by the Academy is a shock - she couldn't have been on screen for more than 6 minutes.  She was convincing enough as a young prostitute, but not at all compelling or memeroble in my opinion.  De Niro did a fine job as a near-lunatic ex-marine and he looked the part with a chisled body, but his headlong no-holds barred pursuit of Shepard in her office was completely out of character and not believable.  Even more unbelievable was that he would simply not be interested in her later in the movie, given where he was at that particular point in his life.

For her part, Shepard was not much more than eye-candy.  She was a necessary plot link between the streets of new York and the good Senator, but in the end served no greater purpose than that.

The climactic shoot-out was the only highlight in the movie and that's only if you can stomach some rather brutal imagery that makes you feel like you were there.  During the shootout, I wasn't really sure what I wanted the outcome to be.

While I haven't seen all of the ""special"" features what I have seen so far was pretty plain vanilla fare with little to no great insight.  ""It was a movie that we had to make.""  ""We didn't think anyone would watch it.""  ""We really didn't talk much about what it meant, we all just knew.""  It sounded as if they were just going through the motions.

Bottom line, I'm glad I watched it just to know what it was and to see the original ""You talkin' to me?"" scene, but definitely not a top-notch movie in my opinion.",1283126400,5,2739,4.341846758349705

Well, Travis finds in his lonely life only a beautiful woman, the really superb Cybill Sepherd, which for me represents life or Eros. But after the sordid incident of the X rated cinema and the killings, Travis carries another more  time this woman in his taxi until her home: I think a clear invitation, really difficult to resist for any man.
But Travis although polite, rejects these opportunity of love and life, and the film ends in following with his taxi in search I think, of more problems, Thanatos or the death.",1282694400,,720,4.4961832061068705
13264,2,0767830555,"As usual, I do not write my reviews to get agreement since 95% or more of the population does NOT know what is good from bad, pearl to a swine.

You know how you watch old movies and now, even when you watch them again, you still tend to rate them high due to memories of watching them when you were younger and feeling the obligation to remain faithful to how you felt?

That's how this movie is. It's an oldie with good acting and whatnot, but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons:

SPOILER ALERT!!!
INTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A BLANK.

In no specific order:

1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.

2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.

3. The movie doesn't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme....which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact. So basically that part of the plot goes like this: He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life's of the city aka drug dealers, prostitution, etc etc. Then he trains with a few guns that he bought, then one day he just decides okay it's time to do it. Then he goes and kills three criminals. Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes. You're left confused till the very end and it's not a clever setup either.

4. There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene. Scenes like:
a) He fell in love with this blond, which dumped him.
b) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond.
c) The scenes with the other cab drivers, never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer.
d) Scenes of him training, did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys???? Thought he was going to take out an army or something, totally anti-climatic.
e) Most of the cab scenes, read the following below.

5. The movie, I felt, did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver. Why do I feel this way? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew, could have been done, felt, or known even without being a Taxi Driver. Let's go deeper. He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it. You don't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this. A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver, using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy, etc.

Thinking back on that movie, the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him, but even that I felt was useless. And this scene alone confuses the plot, not help clarifies anything. He knows nothing of the guy, how can he be a supporter?

So what? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he's a hero? What the heck? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes? It's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior. CRAP!!

The acting was good, but the movie, IMO, is not that great. It was probably a good oldie, but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all.",1281139200,,4379,4.288135593220339

13287,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver stars Robert Di Nero as Travis Bickell, an isolated, alienated Viet Nam vet living in NYC, during the mid-70s. Travis inhabits a world of violence, crime, and sleaze, as he makes his way through NY as a nighttime taxi driver. His personal life is empty, and he has no intimate friends, family, or romantic attachments.

Travis negotiates his life in the Big Apple as best he can, without much morale support at all. When Travis becomes acquainted with a teen-age prostitute named Iris, he's determined to save her from her low-life pimp, and get her off the streets. And Travis is willing and able to use deadly means, to accomplish this mission.

There couldn't have been a better actor to play Travis, than Di Nero. It's as if he was born to play Travis. He does a superb job, of conveying Travis's acute sense of anguish, rage, and steely determination, to rescue Iris from her sordid existence. An excellent supporting cast graces this film too; especially Jody Foster as Iris, Harvey Keitel as the vile pimp, and Peter Boyle as a fellow taxi driver, and confidante to Travis.

Taxi Driver is a magnificent, hard-hitting urban drama. The genius involved in crafting this utterly compelling film, makes it among the best movies of all time. Highly recommended, for those that like a film with deep, meaningful emotional impact.",1262044800,,1342,4.851528384279476
13288,5,0767830555,"If you want a sappy uplifting movie, go buy 'You Light Up My Life"" or ""The Sound Of Music.""  If you dare to peer into the seedy side of life and the descent into madness, HERE IS!

Martin Scorcese's classic Taxi Driver is the quintessential ""Through The Looking Glass"" examination of how a man becomes an island in a city of millions.  The Classic Anti-Hero, Travis Bickle, (Robert DeNero, ""Henry Krinkle"") is all too pathetic, all too pitiful in the way that he wrenches from you pure disgust of his persona.  Everyone sometime in life have felt that crushing loneliness he goes through, but few people compound that loneliness in layers as he does.  It seems that his every action feeds his problems until he loses contact with reality, and his fantasies take control to turn him into a killing machine.  Through Travis' eyes and mind we see the worst of society.  Travis seems to incorporate all these defects into his own personality.

Through stop action, repeating a scene and close ups of Travis' diary you get a glimpse into Travis' twisted mind.  Travis prefers to stare at dissolving Alka Seltzer than to pay attention to reality.  Travis cannot accept life as it is.  He sees people as either scum or angels.  Yet he can only relate to the things he hates the most.

Scorsesee in his commentary states that the ending of Taxi Driver is a portrayal of the anti-hero becoming the hero, only to be cocked and ready to be triggered again into another ""episode."" I think that the ending is merely Travis' psychotic fantasy dream as he is dying.  Real life does not operate the way Travis dreams it must operate.  As in the movie ""All That Jazz"" the main character's death is all choreographed in his own mind.

Dare to relive this nighhtmare!  DeNiro's performance is so realisticly tragic that even the camera at times cannot take looking at him, and would rather pan an empty hallway than look at Travis and his pitiful condition!",1260921600,,1938,4.669616519174041
13289,5,0767830555,"I'd heard Taxi Driver was a great movie, and with Scorcese at the helm and all kinds of famous actors in it to boot, I was expecting good things.  Nor was I disappointed.  Taxi Driver is a special movie.  It's a character study on one hand, a philisophical treatise on the other.  It simultaneously entertains with it's sultry shots of 1975 NYC, lots of good dialogue between the characters, and a story line that unfolds naturally - people who appreciate photography will especially like Taxi Driver - it's a joy to watch Scorcese tell this tale.

The movie is accessible on many levels, the acting is fantastic and the story itself, subtle, violent, occasionally funny - and finally, something to think about for those that are paying attention.

SPOILERS

The thing to notice is when he's trying to decide if he should 'do a bad thing' and he's talking to one of the other taxi drivers asking for advice.  One of the things the guy says as he tries to talk him down is that we are what we do.. like you do a job, and that becomes who you are.  This movie is never very 'in your face' about it's message if it could be said to have one at all.  But what does happen?  Either way, Travis is kind of a sick puppy with the desire to kill.  When that desire is aimed at the politician, he's a wacko (he wants to whack him because the girl he loves and who rejected him, is working on his campaign - this would be a kind of revenge, showing who 'has the power' - in his twisted mind).

On the other hand, he meets the underage prostitute (Jodie Foster), devolops a protective streak towards her and ultimately ends up offing her pimp and other would-be enablers of her profession.  This happens somewhat by accident.  His first mission was to off the politicician.  He takes up Jody Foster's mission as kind of a side inspiration and does the deed before he gets a chance to kill the politician.  When the smoke clears he's a hero.  An accidental hero.  Again, the words of the older taxi driver are fulfilled: 'You are what you do'.

The IRONY is that it could so easily have gone the other way.  What would he have been if he'd managed to hit the politician?  Had it gone as he'd originally planned, he'd certainly have been nothing less than the 'trash' he despised - from any rational person's point of view.  How much of what we do is up to chance, luck, or as fate would have it?  The movie seems to unconsciously ask this question.  Travis is a 'walking contradiction'.  He hates the scum, the sickos, the perverts, but finally, it's only a stroke of fate that distinguishes him from them.

Taxi Driver is a great ride, and there are many reasons to see it.

13307,5,0767830555,"I completely agree that child prostitution is despicable, but I felt that this movie did not glorify it and actually used it to highlight the absolute worst level of ""scum"" that Travis Bickle was cleaning out.  Harvey Keitel's character was so utterly loathsome, *especially* when he was lying to Iris and pretending to love her after the revolting things he had told Bickle, that I nearly told myself to never see another movie with him (all was forgiven though when Bickle blew him away).

I did not see Jodie Foster's character as an adult or depicted as one, even though I'm used to seeing her in movies as an adult.  She was a little girl who knew nothing about real life (quite clearly covering her immaturity/ignorance with astrology) and was being brutally exploited. Being a child prostitute did not ""wisen"" her to the world.  Incidentally, I could not fathom how John Hinckley found her attractive in this movie, although I think I can understand how Bickle's character inspired him after reading his bio on wikipedia.

My favorite scene in the movie was when Bickle walked straight up to Cybil Shepherd, who was completely out of his league, and bluntly asked her out with no games, no gimmicks, and no slickness, and then went on to have an incredible first date.  I felt that was the character's finest point- only to blow everything on the second date!  It seemed everything went downhill for Bickle from that point onward, from that big mistake that he made.  He shouldn't have tried to bring her into his world.  Wasn't he trying to get out of it?

I think that to a large degree, Bickle created his own reality and that was my take-away from this film.  It was not shoved down his throat.  He *chose* to work the late-night shift in the worst neighborhoods.  He chose to spend his free time watching adult movies instead of something more uplifting (although later, he seemed to gravitate towards watching romantic shows on TV).",1248566400,,1945,4.735905044510385

Travis Bickle (Robert Deniro) is a loner cab driver who loves working the night shift due to his insomnia.

After this bizarre behavior, she wants nothing to do with him.  Unfortunately, he is obsessing on her.

His preoccupation with Betsy leads him to a deep hatred of pretty much everything after she dumps him.  One of his targets is the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is working.  Bickle decides to assassinate him.

Meanwhile, he becomes enchanted in a non-sexual way with 12 year old prostitute Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).  His anger at the poor treatment she receives leads to other consequences.

This is an interesting look at alientation and loneliness of some of the fringe people in big city life.  This is a rather extreme case of it.

Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with ""cleaning up"" New York City.

In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.

Bickle's transformation from a ""disturbed"" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, ""You talking' to me?"" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes people never forget.

The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film.

It's sometimes hard to remember that Robert DeNiro was once a serious actor and not a semi-comedian who has sunk to the level of self-parody. However, watching ""Taxi Driver"" makes you realize how DeNiro gained his reputation in the first place. It is DeNiro's performance that makes ""Taxi Driver"" and without it, this film would have been long forgotten. That's not to say that the script, directing and other acting aren't also great. It's just that, the focus of this film is on one man's descent into madness and obsession, and without a convincing actor in the lead role, this film would not have worked. The intensity of DeNiro's performance translates well into Binkle's own intensity in his crusade.

""Taxi Driver"" has a reputation for the levels of violence that it contains, but with the exception of the final 10 - 15 minutes, it is actually surpringly non-violent. Having said that, this is a very disturbing film. Watching DeNiro practice pointing a gun made me wonder if this is what mentally unstable killers are like just before they commit a crime, and it comes as no surprise to hear that this is the film that inspired John Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan.

This film well deserves it's place on many ""greatest films"" lists and hopefully it will continue to remain on such lists for many years to come.",1237593600,2,1608,4.84
13312,4,0767830555,"*Taxi Driver* is an excellent movie featuring superb acting by DeNiro, Foster, and Keitel.  The cinematography is fantastic in that its combination of lighting and location sets perfectly the mood.  The story is important in that it served as a warning when American society began changing drastically (i.e. nuclear familial breakdown) from the late 1960s - mid 1970s.  Its ultimate message is correct in its asessment of spiritual isolation's consequences (as well as the results of unjustified violence).
  The movie, however, goes too far in its acceptance of youth exploitation.  Keitel's character, a child's pimp, is portrayed as somewhat caring and paternal.  As another reviewer noted, ""he is not a monster.""  Such is dangerous acceptance (even if only intellectual for the movie's sake) of a vile practice which should never be tolerated under any circumstances.
  Anyone who abuses children in any way (especially sexually, physically, or emotionally) for any reason (especially in a rational way for financial gain) is nothing short of a monster.  While vigilantism is also not acceptable, those who hurt children should be prosecuted to the fullest legal extent.  They should never be portrayed as anything other than what they are; selfish, abusive, and cowardly.
  Foster's character portrayal has a serious flaw; while she is supposed to be 12 years old, she is actually depicted as an adult.  This film would have viewers think Foster's character is not really being abused or exploited, as she independantly decided to begin prostituting herself.  The film further implies that attempts to rescue her are in vain, as she has already lost her innocence and cannot return to a normal girl's life.
  That characterization fails to consider an extremely important premise; 12 year-old children do not have the maturity, experience, or soundness of judgement to decide they want to be prostitutes. Such is the entire basis for all minimum age laws (be they sexual consent, alcohol purchase/consumption, driving, or voting related).  As children cannot rationally decide they want to be prostitutes, any adult who partakes of this activity in any way is an accomplice at the very least.
  Furthermore, not all those who want to help child victims are deranged lunatics looking for an excuse to shoot people or use violence.  Helping the powerless is what being a good person is all about.  This movie would have people believe anyone who wants to protect the innocent or offer a helping hand has serious psychological problems.  How ridiculous!
  Finally, giving up on lost children is not the reasonable answer.  While underage prostitutes will have obviously lost much innocence and will not be their pre-street selves if rescued, there is no excuse for allowing their continued abuse.  Coal miners trapped for extended periods after cave-ins often must live with serious mental problems if rescued.  Would it therefore make sense to argue they should not be rescued because they will not be their original happy selves?
  While this is a great movie, please watch it with the understanding that child prostitution is inherently abusive and should never be condoned.",1235347200,,3179,5.235643564356436

13315,5,0767830555,"In 1976, Martin Scorsese directed ""Taxi Driver"", starring Robert DeNiro. Calling this a ""conservative"" movie is a stretch, but it is a prescient look at New York attitudes that preceded the age of Giuliani. Paul Schrader wrote it. His story is a hoot in and of itself. He and his brother were raised in a strict Calvinist Pennsylvania family, emphasizing the strictest tenets of Scripture and absolutism. The Calvinists are big on pre-ordained destiny. Released from this environment, he came to Hollywood and tried everything. Naturally, he was a mess; a drug addict, an alcoholic and a heterosexual so confused he tried homosexuality just?to try it. Given the assignment to write a screenplay, he was holed up in a downtown L.A. hotel for weeks, then months. He had little social contact except occasional taxi rides to restaurants in and around L.A.'s skid row. He began to see the world from inside the taxi, and came up with a character and a plot revolving around the concept.
DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in ""Death Wish"" (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.
The message of ""Taxi Driver"" is that peace comes from strength. It was a popular theme in a number of flicks. Hollywood seemed to fail to grasp some important realities about its marketplace. Time after time, movies that veered away from ""touchy feely"" liberalism and gave teeth to conservative characters (Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"", Bronson, DeNiro, and others) made boffo box office, yet the industry has never come to grips with itself. They return time after time to premises that insult conservative audiences, and wonder why the lines get shorter.",1233878400,2,2118,4.935574229691877

The existential musings of an alienated man juxtaposed with that same man's contempt for the filth and corruption he sees all around him make up the heart and soul of ""Taxi Driver"".  There are more memorable lines of dialogue in this film that speak of the truths of life than in some entire years' worth of Oscar fare.  ""You do a thing and that's what you are"".  Simple. Concise. Easy to understand. Irrefutably true. We are each nothing more than the sum of the things we have said and done.  This is the meaning of life and it's in one throwaway line from a film filled with nearly two hours of genius.  The setting of New York is so quintessentially American that this film would not have worked anywhere else.  There is just something so instantly recognizable and identifiable about that city that every man, woman, and child in America feels like they've lived there even if (like me) they have never even been there.  There simply is no other possible place for Travis Bickle to dwell and it is used to full effect in this film.  Also of note is i9n the movie Cybill Shepherd's hotness.  Her character's overreaction to porn speaks of serious issues, but I suppose when you're that gorgeous you can afford to be prudish.

What most people remember from ""Taxi Driver"" is the legendary bit where DeNiro stands in front of a mirror and practices taunting an imaginary foe with the iconic line and mannerism that will never die, ""You talkin' to me?"".  Influences of the film that I didn't mention in the video include numerous other musical references and homages in film and television.

So 35 years later, ""Taxi Driver"" continues to inspire commentary on current events.  If that is not a deep work of art, nothing is.

This is a movie that will speak to anybody who's found society to be nearly irredeemable, but is still compelled to seek a connection to the people within it.  Go get yourself ""organizized"", understand all that is you, and take it to the world at large in the way you see fit.  This character's plan of action is contrary to my very nature and downright psychotic, but as a fictional person in a work of art, his rampage is inspiring in it's purity.  Bickle's missions of choice are very different, but the same in that he seemed to seek to free the two women in his life from the thrall of two very different but in their own way powerful men. Travis may not have accomplished all of his goals in the movie or even consciously known what they were, but in his violent unfocused catharsis he does save the soul of young prostitute even as he abandons his own.  And even doing so in brutal fashion, he at least gains the respect of a woman he loves but will never understand.  Leave it to the media to turn a bloodbath into an act of heroism.

The special features on this DVD include two commentaries, some great featurettes with Scorsese talking about his personal experiences, point of view, and goals when he made the film, and plenty more to delve into.  It was a long time coming for this special edition, but I'm glad I waited. This is DeNiro's best film, and Scorsese's best film. Enough said. BUY IT!",1232668800,2,4293,5.3841554559043345
13317,5,0767830555,"Before Fight Club, before Blade Runner, before any of the nihilistic urban-decay movies there was Taxi Driver. I'm not going to lie- there's a lot about Taxi Driver that feels very '70s. But about halfway through the movie, in a scene with practically no dialogue, DeNiro and Scorsese supercede time period and genre to make what can only be described as movie poetry.

DeNiro is perfect as Travis Bickle, a hyper-alienated borderline sociopath, a psycho who never noticed his descent into madness. He rides around the city all night, and as all his attempts at human connection fail, he obsessively looks for purity in a depraved world, first with a young political aid, later a 12-year old prostitute. The prostitute, Iris, is played with remarkable candour by a young Jodie Foster.

Travis is simultaneously at home in the squalor of his city and violently disgusted by it. Does it change him into something human or something monstrous? There are no easy answers. But in the end, we are as taken with Travis as he is with his two loves. Taxi Driver is terrifying and fascinating, at times bizarrely funny, at times chilling, always brilliant.",1232582400,,1146,4.902061855670103
13318,3,0767830555,"This movie is very powerful and is certainly deserving of its Top 100 AFI rating.  This is the story of madness and the slow decent into criminal violence that it leads Taxi Driver Bickle when he sees it as the only way out of a hopeless situation.  Loneliness can be a terrible thing to deal with and while most people struggle with it and choose a more conventional and healthy solution others with mental illness or who are prone to it ""choose"" different paths that may lead to self-destruction or as in the case of Travis Bickle, vigilante-ism and taking the law into his own hands to set things ""right.""  The lonely angry psychopath who reacts in this way is the ticking time bomb that unfortunately is almost never recognised until the effects of their madness come to fruition e.g. the Unabomber etc.  DeNiro does an excellent job in portraying this individual and is genuinely scary in his role; even scarier is the realisation that perhaps at some point in our lives the vast majority of us have at least contemplated taking things into our own hands and so to some extent perhaps even identify and even find ourselves rooting for Travis.  The violent end may have shocked 70s audiences and you get the sense that Scorcese even toned it down a little for fear of a public backlash but it's interesting to me that as violence in film has been getting worse and worse over the years, I felt that it was pretty tame given what we are exposed to these days e.g ""Kill Bill"", ""Blade"" etc and I thought the final scenes were not violent enough relative to today's films.  Ironically, Bickle is treated as a hero and is not punished for his murders in the end which is also interesting as this ticking time bomb is released into the streets in an ominous ending which leaves us expecting a sequel of some sort.  I would like to see a Director's Cut of this movie and to see how Scorcese would ""modernise"" this brilliant film for today's audiences.  In my opinion, this is the best film since ""Midnight Cowboy"" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.

This dvd version of the film though is a bit of a mixed bag as although the picture and sound quality have been cleaned up the sound quality in 2 channels isn't very good and I'm glad that in the newer 2-Disc and upcoming Blu-ray versions you'll get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound option which I hope sounds much better than what we get here.  The picture quality isn't perfect as a few frames here and there have spots and other imperfections on them but I thought it was done well enough to not detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  The Special Features includes a good making-of documentary with interviews with Scorcese and the cast.

Overall this is a great study into the lone, crazed anti-hero and is certainly one of the better films that I've ever seen.  You may however want to give this particular dvd version a miss and go instead for either the Blu-ray or the other 2-disc standard version with the improved sound quality.

Updated 1 July 2011: 4 stars.

Amazon won't let me review this separately and so I'll do it here.  The blu-ray release of this wonderful Scorcese classic is a treat for fans as it certainly improves upon the dvd release that I reviewed above.  The digipak packaging with a number of colour postcards is very nice.  The all important picture and sound quality have also improved a great deal although the picture quality isn't perfect as there is still excessive grain in some parts especially in the scene in the brothel when DeNiro first speaks with Foster as well as in other spots but it is still an improvement over the dvd.  The sound quality is now in excellent surround mode and is the aspect most improved over the dvd version.

Not perfect picture quality-wise but still worth the double-dip.

13319,5,0767830555,"Being a cab driver for almost 18 years, Taxi Driver is a personal favorite of mine. Driving a cab is like a drug: you get to meet new people everyday; you don't have to wait a week or two to get paid---everything's cash money; you get to know the whole city; you learn where the hot spots are--the restaurants, the bars, the clubs, etc. You set your own hours and you choose where you want to work and whom you want to serve. You have no one breathing down your neck--you are your own boss. There's a saying among cabbies: only two kinds of people get more p**** than cabbies: movie stars and rock stars.

Being a cab driver is like being a sponge. You become a therapist, a conscience, a drinking buddy, a strip club buddy, a shoulder to cry on, or a one-night stand. People show themselves to you, but you're a cabbie and you've seen it all anyway. For an extra-nice tip, a cab can be a rolling motel, a getaway car, or a safe haven to indulge strange pleasures. A cabbie is faceless from the back seat: he or she won't judge you.

After a while, every cabbie develops a callus: every passenger becomes a blur. Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, sees society as converging dots flowing together like the scum on his windshield. Prostitutes, pimps, addicts, and winos gum the sidewalks. Urine stings every breath. Neon melts over his cab. This is the world that Travis lives in, and he hates it more and more everyday.

The world has become a toilet to Travis Bickle. Out of this filth appears a flower of virtue that nothing can touch--a young gorgeous campaign-volunteer named Betsy played by Cybill Shepherd. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Driving a cab at night, all Travis sees are whores; however, Betsy's incorruptible, and she alone can redeem mankind. She allows him to take her on a date. Though awkward, he says all the right things. He takes her to the theater to see a movie--a porno flick. Horrified and offended, she hails a cab and leaves him on the sidewalk. Travis is stunned. At that moment, a whore saunters by. They pause to gaze at each other--she is his mirror; they are one and the same.

Betsy destroys Travis; she's just like all the others. Now, there's nothing in the world worth saving--now, he knows what he must do. He hones his body and his mind: no more smoking; no more drinking; no more bad food--he must be fit. He'll annihilate Betsy and the whole world. By chance, he stumbles into the middle of a pimp/whore squabble; the whore is a thirteen-year-old girl. Something rises up in Travis's heart, something he never felt before. He discovers something worth saving-- a lost thirteen-year-old whore named Iris (Jodie Foster).

Taxi Driver was the second collaboration between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. Bernard Herman's magical score wafts over every scene. Taxi Driver was an omen, forecasting the senseless tragedies of both Columbine and Virginia Tech. No movie collection is adequate without this great film. See it. Buy it. Enjoy it.

13324,4,0767830555,"Martin Scorsese, the writer/director of the Taxi Driver, has admitted that this film is the cathartic result of a bevy of dark thoughts that surrounded his mind during a very low period of his life. By the time the credits finally make their merciful way on screen, we can see exactly what Scorsese saw during those days and the residual effect it has on us, the viewers, will likely stay hauntingly familiar long after we have watched the conclusion of this film.

PLOT:

Tavis Bickle, a taxi driver and volunteer for a New York City political campaign, has tried it all. He's attempted doing things the right way, treating people with kindness and women with respect. Nevertheless, he is ignored and his chivalrous advances continually stepped upon or altogether discarded by one person after another. It is when Tavis realizes that he will forever be average and overlooked that he decides to make drastic changes in his world. Almost at once he begins driving the most dangerous portions of New York in his taxi, scouring the nighttime landscape with his mind cultivating a solution to his own personal, dark problems. Soon, his decision becomes conclusive: he will become a vigilante, and his first offering to the world will be in aiding a young teenaged prostitute by providing her a way out, no matter what it may cost Tavis personally in the process.

Perhaps Scorsese's most poignant film, The Taxi Driver offers a bleak, but somehow refreshing, alternative to the concept of ""taking it lying down."" Here, in his vision, there is another solution, and one in which while many of us fantasize about, almost all of us refuse to make a reality.

13325,5,0767830555,"I can definetely see why this movie is considered a classic. It is both powerful and disturbing. And completely memorable.
 I haven't made up my mind whether the ending is fantasy or reality and I do see a strong case for both, however I am leaning towards reality because I feel they wouldnt have panned the wall of his still oh-so-cheap apartment with the newspaper clippings and the letter. It would have been more dream-like. But who knows, lol. Perhaps it was left a bit ambiguous to produce discussion.

 If someone did this in real-life the ending would be an institution for the criminally insane (probably for life), although many would regard the person as a hero IF the actual story came out accurately (thats a big if). And who says insane people don't ever become heroes :)

 Im glad I watched it although I found it to be very hard to watch as I feel it was almost too real. With the meth and crack plague in America the portrayal of the young girl was a bit too close to home for me. Which is why this movie doesnt even feel as though it has aged a bit.

The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead.",1210118400,2,541,4.161904761904762
13337,5,0767830555,"When I first saw this film, I was literally shocked at the end. De Niro played a lonley, mentally disturb man extremely well. By the end of the film, we see the end result of Travis's mental prison. Travis worked as a taxi driver frequenting areas high in crimes, prostitution, sex, drug, and other oddities of our modern society. Throughout the film, we saw Travis transform from a lonely person who perhaps has communication issues to an obsession to end the life of a candidate. By the end of the film, Travis decides instead of killing a presidential candidate, he would save the life of a 12 years old girl imprisoned by her pimp to a life of prostitution. Armed with a 44 magnum and various other pistols, Travis went to the girl's pimp and ruthlessly, and violently, killed him and all those associated with the girl's imprisonment. At the end of the film, I was a bit confused. Travis is hailed as a hero by the news and everything was ""back to normal"" - Travis was back at his job as a taxi driver. The 12 years old girl apparently returned to her parents who thanked De Niro. I read over some theories about the ending and they are all plausible. As with all good endings to movies, it leaves the audience questioning what they saw rather than giving them a straight answer. I applaud the makers of the film for the ending that leaves you asking questions rather than finding answers.

Overall, Taxi Driver was a shockingly, scary movie about loneliness in a big city filled with crimes and other unpleasantness. After watching the film once, I couldn't get it out of my mind. At one point I sympathized with De Niro's character, then by the end, I was shocked at what he did.",1209859200,,1686,4.509803921568627
13338,5,0767830555,"I first saw Taxi Driver when it was released in the mid 1970s (over 30 years ago!), and was amazed then at DeNiro as an actor and the movie as a whole. The movie was so fascinating to me back then as a youngster that I remember dragging my girlfriend to the movie theatre at least 6-7 times to see it over and over. I just got the double DVD set and am re-amazed (is that a word?) at DeNiro's acting and again , with the movie as a movie. This is a film that you need to watch several times to take it all in. As for DeNiro - in my opinion, the best actor ever (forget the wasted performances in Meet the Parents, the Flockers, etc.), watch his facial expressions, catch his voice mannerisms, etc., and I think you'll agree he really nailed the part of a man who is a little off to start and whose life spirals downhill. Screenwriter Paul Schrader's commentary (on disc 2) on society's fixation with fame/media, and with making anybody a ""hero"", even a killer, is even more applicable today. This is a fascinating movie, really one of a kind.

13340,4,0767830555,"1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.

13342,5,0767830555,"Scorsese's finest film explores the psyche of an unstable individual living in a self-imposed loneliness brought about by his schizophrenia. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver and a man plagued by his inability to integrate socially. Thus, the rejection he receives withdraws him further and further into his own delusions. He harbors nothing but contempt and loathing for the city of New York in which he lives; it is a city he sees filled with decay, crime, violence, and prostitution. Envisioning himself as ""God's lonely man,"" Travis is surrounded by people he cannot approach nor relate to, people he consequently perceives as cold and distant. Scorsese places the viewer within this subjective schizoid experience with the cinematography and voice-over.

The plot takes Travis through his stages of rejection and follows him as his delusions evolve new releases for his frustrations. Because Travis considers his own shortcomings the result of other's actions, he extends this view to those around him and perceives others as suffering at the hands of external, corrupting figures also. Early in the film we are introduced to his muse and angel, Betsy, and we hear as he narrates from his diary, ""they cannot touch her."" This is a testament to both his delusional paranoia and his admiration for her. She is dressed in white and is captured walking slowly with a smile -- a symbol of the unspoilt purity Travis sees in her. He works up the courage to ask her on a date and she complies. They meet a few times, however, after Travis takes Betsy to a porno movie, she rejects him. There are a few theories as to why he brings her to the porno movie in the first place but the one I find most interesting (and the one which makes the most sense in the context of the rest of the film) is that Travis has what is known as the Madonna-whore complex meaning he cannot integrate his desires for love and sex -- there exists a dichotomy within his psychology which keeps the two separate. In his mind women who are sexually interested in him must be whores (for how else could they want ME?) and women who aren't sexually interested in him may remain desirable, but ultimately unlovable in the fullest sense. Nonetheless, following her rejection, Travis deludes himself into thinking she must be corrupted as well (she fails to return his phone calls so now he considers her cold and distant like all the rest, and therefore corrupted) and so begins the formulation of his master-plan to liberate the objects of his desire. This concludes the first stage of his rejection.

Travis finds his calling after crossing paths with a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris. Wanting to rescue her from her private hell, he offers to take her away from the pimp controlling her. Upon her refusal of his aid, he is now further troubled by this second rejection. (Getting back to the subject of the Madonna-whore complex, we can see that the woman Travis wants most, Betsy, he cannot have, and the one he doesn't want, Iris, he can have.) These events lead Travis to execute his grandiose plan to elevate himself to the level of a hero and free his objects of desire from their ""own private hells."" Seeking to remove the source of their corruption, Travis proceeds to assassinate a presidential candidate (whom he sees as the paternal figure to Betsy -- Betsy is a staunch supporter of his and a volunteer campaigner) and kill Iris' pimps. Although failing to assassinate the candidate, he does succeed in killing the pimps, albeit after taking a few shots to the neck and shoulder.

As the police arrive in the brothel after the carnage has taken place, we see Travis lift his gun up to his head and pull the trigger. Nothing, his ammunition is empty. Travis then draws his finger to his head and mimicks three gun shots. This symbolizes Travis' final rejection of himself following his previous two rejections.

In the final scene as he lays dying from his wounds, we see Travis' final vision/revelation. In this vision, the papers applaud him as the hero who rescued the young prostitute Iris and her parents even express their admiration for his actions. We even see Betsy come back to Travis, showing that his delusions are similar to the prototypical Hollywood ending wherein the main woman comes back to the hero at the end of the story. Although here Betsy appears open towards him, he remains cold and does not acknowledge her presence. He has accepted the theory of his fellow cabbie who tells him earlier that people tend to become their job. At the end, Travis accepts who he is as a taxi driver. Just preceding his implied physical death we witness his final spiritual affirmation as the film exits the way it entered, with Travis driving through the city in his taxi cab.

The motif here -- character receiving a vision of desired destiny, which he must reject before death -- is a recurring one throughout Scorsese's oeuvre. It is seen most strictly in The Last Temptation of Christ and Casino, for instance.",1201824000,,5001,4.776878612716763

13367,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver gives us a gripping character study of Travis Bickle, a rather lonely man who takes a job as a nighttime taxi driver because he can't sleep at night. Unfortunately for Travis, he can't sleep in the day either; instead he goes to dirty movies and runs around the city. Travis is unable to make any real emotional connections with people, although he does try.

Travis's first interest in a young woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who is working to help a Senator get elected to the White House. Betsy soon rejects Travis, though, when on their first date he takes her to a dirty movie. After being rejected by Betsy, Travis soon develops an interest in guns--but in a most unhealthy way. Travis dreams of murder although he does still have enough of his sanity left to want to rescue a very young girl, Iris (Jodie Foster), from a group that uses her as a woman of the night. All of this happens as Travis descends deeper and deeper into a world of madness and psychosis.

The insight we gain into Travis's character could not have been done any better: we see Travis as the outsider who watches New York City and its people go by as people take rides in his taxi cab. He meets a good intentioned politician and many not so admirable characters as well. All along, we increasingly see that Travis is ever more on the outside looking in; and he's often remarkably disgusted and enraged about the not so happy quality of life issues in the city.

Will Travis rescue Iris from a life of being a woman of the night? Will Travis be able to control his urges to use his guns on real people instead of keeping his outrage in the realm of fantasy? What might happen if Betsy and Travis were to get together again--is it possible? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The cinematography shows strong in the pans of the city at all hours as it is seen through Travis's eyes; and the choreography works well in the bloody fighting at the end of the movie, too.

A warning to parents: there is quite a bit of violence and mental illness in this film. This is not a Disney movie!

Overall, Taxi Driver takes hold of your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go. I marveled at the fine acting and the plot moves along at a good pace. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy great character studies and the work of such greats as Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese.",1196208000,,2427,4.41834451901566

I write this on the day after the release from prison of Arthur Bremer, would-be assasin of Democratic Presidential candidate and segregationist George Wallace was gunned down and paralyzed for life in a Maryland campaign stop. I was a grade schooler when this shooting took place and it was one of the more horrific events to see on TV at that age. Screenwriter Paul Scrader and directer Martin Scorcese based ""Taxi Driver"" on the events of Arthur Bremer's life and diary, a man with a pathetic and lonely existense who sought quick fame and acceptance by assasinating a political figure. FIrst he tried to blast Richard Nixon, and when that proved too difficult, he made Democratic front runner George Wallace his target. There was no political motivation in Bremer's actions, only a desire to rise above the emptyness of his existence.

Lead Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is an insomniac Viet Nam veteran who turns to driving a cab at night to make a few extra bucks (he may have a disability check, but that's never clear) and to try to relax his spirit a little. In pre-Guiliani NYC circa 1975, it's not a good move. The city is crawling with hookers, pimps, dope addicts and general filth. As Bickle motors away his evenings, the atmosphere begins to rot his soul and exacberate his mental condition.

Attempts at normacly fail. Bickle, as many crazed people, seems to have honest perceptions and a nothing-to-lose attitude which impresses Cybill Shepard (a political campaign worker) enough to accompany him on a date. Bickel proves to be socially inept however and scares her away, further plunging him into first despair, then a desperate regiment of push-ups, calisthenics and target practice. Eventually, with no ideology or clear motive, Bickel makes a failed attempt at shooting Jack Pallandine, the Presidential candidate his romantic interest works for.
Still with bullets and blood on his mind, Bickle goes to the Lower East Side and instead blasts Harvey Keitel, the pimp of underage hooker Jody Foster  as well as a brothel goon and a reputed Mafioso client. Taking bullets himself in the exchange, Bickel survives and is accepted briefly as a hero by a public who surely does not understand the depth of Bickles insanity or the fact he had attempted earlier to  assasinate a politico.

It is unclear in the film if the shooting Bickle is involved in serves to normalize his life. He is seen driving a cab and back to work at the end, but one can only guess how stable he really is. Also unclear is whether the script intends to qualify victims, ie- it's OK to shoot child-pimps but a no-no to shoot politicians, and that the difference between being a hero and a kook is the choice of your target. Perhaps as myself you will come away from this realizing how misunderstood many people are and how easily the media and public can misinterperet an event. That said, it is very intense and scary to see how Bickles life descends to a point where he feels he will be immortalized by an action that takes several seconds. The time in which he is moving to shoot Pallandine and the methodical rampage within the trick pad are some of the tensest moments ever put to screen.
Scorcese does a fine job here. The isolation that is projected by the limited interaction of Bickles life and the ""confined to a cab"" metaphor work to show what insanity may be like. The street scenes and characters are first rate. Even in a city that was worse after crack cocaine hit the streets, Scorcese shows the decay that was so prevalent in the 70's and 80's. Also worth thought is a comparison to a later event of the ""Subway Vigilante"" Bernard Goetz and whether his acts were a similar cry for help or a legitimate defense of self and property.

A great film. Watched by many and probably interpreted in as many different ways.",1194652800,4,3847,4.75
13369,5,0767830555,"Great extras here - love the commentaries which have subtitle options.  They took time with the extra docs on the second disc, there's a nice one where they talk to cabbies and a great one that shows the locations then and now. (Although the documentary that has the most from DeNiro and the rest of the cast is clearly from some time ago and it would have been nice to know when.)

The film itself remains a raw, audacious classic.  It's like an American Look Back in Anger, full of the bitterness and rage of its time.  The outcast filmmakers seize the medium for expression of the culture's hostility, confusion and prejudice.  It's the classic journey through Hell with an unreliable tour guide: Travis Bickle, the psychotic antithesis of the sensitive 70s male.  He's the Vietnam veteran who wants to be Ethan Edwards rather than Kris Kristoferson.  (He points his gun at the kids dancing to Jackson Browne on Bandstand.)

My take:  the two scenes that don't feature Travis only happen in his head.  The first is the scene in the campaign office where Albert Brooks acts out the actions of someone disfigured in the same manner as one of Travis' later victims.  (Travis spends much of his date with Betsy talking about how ""silly"" this guy is, whom he's never met or heard.)  The second scene is between Iris and Sport dancing in their apartment.  When he turns on a record the music we here is Travis's theme - the sax melody that competes with the jarring street theme in the film's earlier scenes.  (Also, everything that happens after the shoot-out is either a fantasy or Travis's coma dream.)",1194134400,3,1602,4.675
13370,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" is certainly one of the finest films in the American tradition; it stands out among films from a very strong decade. It's certainly one of Scorcese's best, and one of his earliest mature works- if ""Mean Streets"" works as a transitional stand-alone film between his early, genre pictures and his later, more varied works, ""Taxi Driver"" is only his second film of the period. It is a directoral masterwork; each decision that Scorcese made here was the right one. It's also one of the clearer examples of the extent to which the American 70s were in a thrall to the films of the Nouvelle Vague. But I digress. The movie has one clear thematic problem, and it's Shrader's. Why does Bickle take Betsy to a porno? If he idealizes her (and he does) he should separate her from the mass by which he is clearly disgusted. Thus, he should wish to protect her from the things he associates with the mass- namely pornography and prostitution. Bickle is clearly torn between including himself in the mass he envisions as damned and separating himself from them; he sees Betsy as a means of saving himself. He only goes to porn theatres to ritualistically purge himself of the tendencies which align him with the mass; Betsy is supposed to take him out of it altogether. Yet, he takes her to a porno. This doesn't make much sense and it's the only reason ""Taxi Driver"" isn't as good as ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""Mean Streets."" This doesn't mean that ""Taxi Driver"" isn't a great or important film. It's outstanding, and this new edition is much-needed.

Speaking of this new edition, it's long overdue. I own the 2001 Special Edition and watched it last week only to be horrified by the grainy, defect-ridden transfer. The 2001 print is a mess- the movie looks as bad as the grindhouse flicks it sometimes mirrors. The transfer in this set could be as bad as an average '01 release and still it would be an improvement. As I don't own the new set, I can't comment on the new features, but they look to be substantial. Therefore, this 2-disc set is absolutely essential for every person with a DVD player.",1192924800,,2112,4.647058823529412

13372,3,0767830555,"this is a great set BUT there is an edit to the film which, for the life of me, I cannot understand on any level.

The funny thing is I watched it with the Paul Schrader commentary and you'd think he'd notice lines of his own dialogue which were now missing.

Anyway, the scene where Travis takes Iris up to her room -- the guy who rents the room (also featured in Scorsese's Mean Streets) tells Travis something like to ""leave your gun cowboy"" and then when Travis and Iris leave and guy says he will be timing them, you can clearly see the gun in the guy's hand even though the earlier the dialogue was missing.

Then when Travis returns, the guy is carrying Travis' gun up to him to return it but you can barely see it this time -- shot seems shorter and I had to freeze-frame it to even see the gun this time -- and his line about it is gone and suddenly Travis gives him the $20 and says ""this is for you...spend it well"" or something.

I watched this scene a few times and even checked the script (also on the disc) and the scene, or rather the lines and bits of the scene, are gone despite being referenced in the script.

This is one of my favorite films of all time and I've seen it on its original release at the drive-in, edited on TV, on cable, and on videotape and am sure those lines were in the film.

Please could someone out there explain this for me?

Is this some kind of retro-tinkering like Lucas did with Star Wars and Spielberg did with E.T.?

13375,5,0767830555,"Travis Bickle - the ""Taxi Driver"" in the film - is not so much a psychopath but someone who is mentally ill. He struggles to relate and connect with other people, slowly becomes detached from reality, indulges in inappropriate behaviour, and has a naive sense of what is right and wrong.

The loneliness and disconnection of Bickle has echoes in the character of Holden Caulfield in ""The Catcher in the Rye"" who likewise drifts around New York City searching for some kind of meaning.

The ending always seemed a little strange until one accepts it as a fantasy of Bickles deranged mind.

""Taxi Driver"" remains a powerful and disturbing film even after all these years despite far more graphic films because the characters are so believable.

A great film from the great Martin Scorsese.",1189296000,,787,4.850746268656716
13385,5,0767830555,"The thing that haunts ""Taxi Driver,"" even after all these years, is how connected a lot of the viewers feel with Travis Bickle, Vietnam veteran and burgeoning psychopath.  Is he really as different as we want him to be, or is he closer to who ""we"" are than we like?

The '70s, for all the talk of it being a cultural wasteland, was a wonderful time if you're a fan of movies.  The angst of Vietnam created a lot of worthy dramas and comedies.  Most of them were very grim, bitter, angry, and disillusioned, but then these qualities make for some fine reflection on the human condition.  As did the setting of the movie, which was New York.  I was a boy at the time, but my parents let me watch the news, as well as the TV of the era, and New York was a schizoid wonderland of success, excess, and the multiblock whore-with-a-heart-of-gold known as Times Square.  DeNiro's unraveling character is most at-home here, surrounded by people (the ""scum"" he hates so much, ironically) yet apart from them, without the first clue how to connect with him.  Is there anything more scary, with all the examples in the movie of Travis' decent into madness, than his perfectly-reasoned decision to take his ""angel"" on a date to a porno theater?

Robert DeNiro, already a veteran or soon-to-be-star of many classics of the period, owns Bickles' troubled soul and is thoroughly believable of a failed ""hero.""  Its not so strange that the only time someone else truly connects with him is when they both have a sense of violent helplessness of their own situations, namely the grocer Travis saves by blowing the would-be robber of his store's brains out.

Martin Scorcese is also able to showcase what would be his greatest directorial skill in the low-budget limitation of the movie.  He is able to allow us to see the reality of Travis' world with the sensitive eye of a documentarian.  The city, the streets, and all who walked them are seen at eye level, at once intimately close and ephermerally fleeting as the cab drives through early-morning Manhattan.  He even gets to show up in the film in at least two cameos - once just as a passerby, the other as a passenger in Travis' taxi who himself is slowly unravelling mentally because his wife is cheating on him.

The unsettling tale of one man's collapse into psychosis is made human and connectable to the audience thanks to Paul Shrader's(sp?) wonderful script.  None of the events in his life that inspired the story, mentioned extensively in the truly-worthy new and old DVD extras, make it into the movie, but the important issue - the lonliness we all feel and have to deal with - does. Travis may be losing his mind and heading for a nuclear-sized explosion, but we can relate to him by how alone he feels.

Shrader calls the cab in the movie ""a rolling metal coffin.""  It's an appropriate metaphor.  Because in the two-perspective ending, we have to wonder if Travis has found the misplaced justification he was looking for when he murders a bunch of lowlives to save a child prostitute - soon after a failed assassination attempt on presidential candidate Pallentine! - from society, or is he simply in his own personal Heaven; we don't see Travis' reflection in the rear-view mirror of his taxi when he adjusts it.

Leonard Maltin's video guide slams this film as excessive, overrated and violent.  He needs to give it another look.  ""Taxi Driver"" is truly a masterpiece of talent and craftsmenship.",1188950400,2,3450,4.686567164179104

13388,5,0767830555,"The first disc features an audio commentary by Professor Robert Kolker. He analyzes the film's style and themes but tends to describe what we are seeing making obvious statements. He talks about the influence of Alfred Hitchcock's movies on Taxi Driver but in mind-numbingly boring way.

The second commentary is by the film's screenwriter Paul Schrader. He points out Travis' contradictory nature - he talks about purifying his body yet he also takes speed. There are several lulls during this commentary but he more than makes up for it with some excellent observations about the film and the nature of screenwriting.

""Original Screenplay"" allows you to read the original shooting script and then go to the corresponding scene in the film.

The second disc starts off with ""Martin Scorsese on Taxi Driver."" He talks about the genesis of the film and how hard it was to get a studio interested. Scorsese says that visually, everything is from Travis' point-of-view.

""Producing Taxi Driver"" features Michael Phillips briefly discussing how he became a producer and how he got the script for Taxi Driver. When he saw Mean Streets, he knew that he wanted Scorsese to direct and Robert De Niro to star.

""God's Lonely Man"" examines the theme of loneliness in the film and profiles Schrader, his background and it informed the script.

""Influence and Appreciation: Martin Scorsese Tribute"" features fellow filmmakers Roger Corman and Oliver Stone along with actor Robert De Niro and others paying tribute to the man.

""Taxi Driver Stories"" includes anecdotes told by actual New York cabbies who worked in the city during the `70s. Some of their stories are wilder than some that are in the film.

""Making Taxi Driver"" is the excellent 70 minute retrospective documentary that was included on the previous edition. It takes a fascinating, in-depth look at how the film came together with most of the major cast and crew members returning, including De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Albert Brooks. This is excellent doc. with loads of information.

""Travis' New York"" reflects on New York City of the `70s. The film's director of photography Michael Chapman points out that now the film is a documentary of what the city looked like back then.

""Travis' New York Locations"" is a very cool featurette that compares nine locations used in the movie then with what they look like now and not surprisingly most them look very different.

13389,4,0767830555,"I didn't see this movie until thirty years after it's release, but that's fine by me.  I don't think I could have handled it in my teens or even my twenties.

DeNiro is wonderful as Travis Bickle.  The world has already worn at him, and we see it wearing at him further at each stage of the movie.  When he tells the Presidential Candidate that the whole city needs to be cleaned up, we feel his emotion.

The one bright point of his life seemed to be the character played by Cybill Shepherd.  This is the part that got me out of my chair.  When he convinced her to go to a movie with him and then took her to a porno film, I said ""What was he thinking?""  Then it hit me - he isn't thinking the way I think.  This man thinks on a parallel plane to the rest of the society he sees.  And even that type of thinking devolves into a form of psychosis as the film progresses.

One more point.  Other reviewers have seen DeNiro's character as a vigilante who got fed up with the scum pushers and pimps.  I will only buy that to a point.  Remember, this is a guy who armed himself to the teeth, practiced dry-firing his guns at the television and was set on assasination.

13390,5,0767830555,"In Brief: Martin Scorsese leads us into the darkness of the human soul by exploring the character of one Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam veteran played by Robert De Niro. Failing to make a connection with those around him, Travis decides to take matters into his own hands, via such instruments as firearms and interesting fashion statements.

 Yes, De Niro is brilliant, and yes, Scorsese's techniques are still as effective today as they were innovative in 1976.

Meanwhile, one element that often goes unmentioned outside of deeper analyses of the film is its musical score, one of Bernard Herrmann's last and very finest. With the veteran composer of Alfred Hitchcock films tabbed for this film, you might have expected dark and disturbing, Psycho-esqe music, befitting Taxi Driver's status as a nightmarish psychological journey. Horrific dirges find their way into the score on occasion, but surprisingly, Herrmann more often used a jazzy, romantic theme to underscore Travis' subconscious rants about the ""scum"" and ""filth"" he'd like to wipe out of New York City.

 Scorsese has shown over the course of his career that he is a director chiefly interested in the duality of human nature - capturing the seductiveness of the mob (Goodfellas), the loneliness of a champion (Raging Bull), and even the humanity of Jesus himself (The Last Temptation of Christ) - and here he presents his most complex character. Is Travis a hero or a monster? The question is never answered to any satisfying degree,
 The director makes no overt rejection of Travis Bickle's ultimate violence, but it may be found in the way the outburst is filmed: the massacre is artfully done, but brutal and unrelenting, and tellingly, there is no music. Herrmann's score works here by its very absence: he and Scorsese subtly inform us that there is no counterpoint to the violence, that it is what it is - and that for the audience, just as Travis must feel, there is no escape.

13391,5,0767830555,"This searing movie from Martin Scorcese is one of the great films of the 1970's. It features Robert DeNiro in the role of a lifetime, as ex-Vietnam vet Travis Bickle, who can't sleep and drives a Cab at night as a form of therapy. Travis also has trouble relating to people and it is this that gives him difficulties when he meets Betsy (played wonderfully by Cybill Shepherd) and things go from bad to worse when he then meets Iris (Jodie Foster) a teenage prostitute.... The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel.

Scorsese works magic in this film. A number of scenes from this film are unforgettable and some have become iconic. Obviously the ""Are you talking to me..."" mirror scene is the most well known but there are a number of others. Travis winds up a Secret Service agent, suggesting he would like to join. This is marvellously played, and you will notice that Travis has made some slight adjustments to his hair. Another classic scene, which certainly influenced Quentin Tarantino for a scene in 'Reservoir Dogs', is where Travis goes to buy some guns. The dialog is marvellous. Full credit to Paul Schrader for the brilliant script, without his contribution the film would not have as good.

The film also contains the last ever film score from Bernard Hermann who had previously done Citizen Kane and Psycho to name but two. This score is really excellent. A Jazzy saxophone with a haunting melody, but that changes menacingly without warning. Quite brilliant.

13404,4,0767830555,"Viewing ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time recently I'm struck by the feeling that I'm seeing it out of context, and that it suffers by my comparison of it to more recent films rather than films that were its contemporaries.  While ""Taxi Driver"" is a societal-cultural touchstone I never felt compelled to see it and having seen it now doubt I would rush back to see it again.  That's not to say it's a bad film, but it is difficult viewing.  Director Martin Scorsese certainly captures the nihilism, ambivalence, angst, dislocation, and malaise of the 1970s to a tee.  Having grown up in that era, I remember that all too well, and in that respect ""Taxi Driver"" is a depressing drive down a memory lane I'd rather avoid.  The characters also lack nuance or much depth: DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a stereotypical ""damaged goods"" Vietnam veteran (which I found profoundly insulting), Peter Boyle's Wizard is a hard-boiled, heat-packing NYC cabbie, Jodie Foster is an equally stereotyped drugged out/addled prostitute, and Harvey Kietel's pimp/hustler borders on an ugly ethnic stereotype you'd only find in a movie of this vintage.  All border on two-dimensional caricatures and are almost over-the-top.

The thing that bothered me most (and perhaps that was Scorsese's intent) is the amoral ambivalence Scorsese presents here.  Politicians are bland and interchangeable, uttering empty platitudes, government is the problem and the solution, Travis is a psycho and a hero.  The movie is fairly drenched in shades of gray rather than the moral certainties of black and white - and perhaps that's Scorsese's intention.  ""Taxi Driver"" was a departure from the Hollywood oeuvre that came before it with obvious heroes and villains.  The end result is a movie that unsettles and causes us to question the nature of good and evil.

While ""taxi Driver"" is not a movie I'd care to see again anytime soon please don't misconstrue that to mean I didn't think it is not worth seeing, because everyone should see it.  Out of context ""Taxi Driver"" is hard to sort out and feels more like camp or a send up of the whole 1970s genre of gratuitously violent films.  ""Taxi Driver"" is far deeper than that as Scorsese forces us to move beyond our Manichean obsessions over the concepts of good and evil.",1177545600,2,2282,4.908854166666667
13405,5,0767830555,"I waited a long time to see this movie. I only knew that it was the film that John Hinckley watched before he tried to murder Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster. Hinckley pretty much tries to do a De Niro in real life, but it's here that De Niro really makes a name for himself. After a few years of low budget films, and slowly working up the chain with ""Bang The Drum Slowly"", and ""The Godfather 2"" He tackles the character of Travis Bickle with reckless abandon. Bickle is a Veitnam vet who after serving over there is lost in America, and he drifts into a taxi-cab company one day to drive a cab. This is 70's America put on film masterfully by Scorsese as I like the clouds of smoke coming from the cab which reminds me of dream sequence. The dream is dead as no one wants to be the hero anymore. Veitnam has hardened America's hearts and minds. However, the same people that ""Turned On, Tuned In, and Dropped Out"" are still doing it in the 70's, but this time they do it from behind a desk as they are now no longer dirty hippies, but clean-cut businessmen, and women. They have now taken the stance that it just doesn't matter anymore. I see this as Bickle sees the drek that NYC has become, and how people just don't want to deal with you, or know your pain unless you do something for them, and this is evident when Bickle sees Betsy played by Cybill Shepphard. Betsy is a campaign manager for the canadate for the President of the United States, and Bickle wants to volunteer, but to get close to Betsy. Well anyway it's 1976, and Veitnam has been over for a year, and the Christian revival that went down in Dallas in 1972 has waned out, and this is what we're left with as Bickle has 1,001 nightmares in the backseat of his cab, but the one that touches him the most is a 12 year old prostitute played by Foster who had only done Disney movies before this. Bickle decides to help her out, and gives her money, and then does the next big thing which is to kill her pimp which gives him 15 minutes of fame, and he is labelled as a hero for doing this. I feel that this is what was going on in Hinckley's mind when he went to D.C. to murder Reagan as Reagan in his first months as President would make alot of changes that are still rippling through America today, and some aren't for the better. I guess this is why ""Rocky"" beat out ""Taxi Driver"" for best picture of 1976 because with ""Rocky"" it's about a person who came out of nowhere, and took on the champ in the boxing ring. This is what America had come up with to heal the wounds that Veitnam left on her as with ""Rocky"" it gave America something to cheer about again where ""Taxi Driver"" was about an Anti-Hero that killed bad to bring about good?, or did it? I mean it was bad enough that the main character served in Vietnam, but to make him a hero because he killed a pimp to save a 12 year old prostitute was not America's cup of tea back then. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that it showed the negatives, or what, but those who did go to Vietnam they deserve the honor and respect that all our servicemen deserve. Perhaps the final scene is rather memorable as Bickle picks up Betsy in his cab, and drives her home as she's going that way, and all of a sudden because he killed the pimp she's looking at him in a different light now as someone she may want to date. However, Bickle isn't buying it now as yes he made a mistake by taking her to porno movie, but after he tries to apologize to her, and make things right it takes him killing a pimp to get her to think differently about him well that's too much. This is a movie not for the kids definitely, and probably not for some adults either. It's a taste of how Americans, and humans in general have been pretty much isolating themselves from each other for one reason, or another, and it's a sad thing to see happen, and over 30 years later it's still happening, and in some ways it's worse today than it was in 1976.",1173571200,2,3969,4.189542483660131
13406,5,0767830555,"I watched this film again recently and find it remarkable it has held up as well as it has. It seems as though it could have been made last year, so timeless is this film. Robert DeNiro is simply perfect as Travis Bickle and I certainly enjoy the terrific performances by Shepherd, Foster, Keitel, et al. This is my favorite Scorcese film and his work here shows why he has earned his reputation as one of the medium's elite filmmakers, while Paul Schrader's script leaves an indelible mark. I think the film, however, would not be the complete masterpiece it is without Bernard Herrmann's music. The man behind the music of ""Citizen Kane"" and so many Hitchcock films, including ""Psycho,"" delivers yet another unforgettable musical score that marries so perfectly with its film. The resulting combination of all these facets is a work that really strikes a chord with me. Yes, it is violent and some of it could be seen as shocking or disturbing; yet, for those who identify with its portrayals of alienation and morality, and who find its style engaging, this film represents a pinnacle in cinema. The collector's edition DVD has some documentary material and the transfer is very good. There are also some extraordinarily unusual subtitles choices.",1170806400,2,1250,4.900943396226415

13409,5,0767830555,"The 1970's are widely regarded as perhaps the most artistically exciting era in film, and ""Taxi Driver"" stands as one of the finest films of that great period and 30 years later, ""Taxi Driver"" is still Scorsese's best film and one of the greatest films of all time.  If, for whatever reason, you have any interest in films at all and still haven't seen ""Taxi Driver"", don't put it off another day.

""Taxi Driver's"" inimitable success is rooted in its two most prominent and seemingly conflicting elements: De Niro's brilliant, empathetic and real lead performance alongside Scorsese's expressionistic, overblown visuals.  Countless films have portrayed the city, and New York City in particular, as a hellish netherworld, but few do so as absolutely and convincingly as ""Taxi Driver"".  The NYC of ""Taxi Driver"" is a blinding, neon-lit freakshow of streetwalkers, killers and (worst of all) politicians where the billowing steam rises from sewer vents to hide the squalor in an opaque mist and the rain pours forever down.  Few viewers are liable to be too fond of what they see in this unreal city, and neither does Travis Bickle, our tortured anti-hero and one of the most memorable characters in all film.  Schrader deserves a lot of credit for conceiving Bickle so brilliantly, but few actors, if any, could've brought life to his contradictory yet somehow understandable personality like Robert De Niro.  These three figures, Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro, are the core of the film, but almost everything else comes together to perfection as well.

This film is all about Travis Bickle, so much so that he's never off screen for more than a minute or two at a time, and not often at that.  Travis isn't from New York City, and isn't a part of it, though he still, somehow, seems to belong.  Bickle  is a lot of things, but his main trait is obvious from the get-go:  He is alone, alienated.  He hates the city;  he prays for the rain to come wash the filth from the streets, but he's drawn to those streets at the same time.  Travis, unable to sleep at night, decides to become a taxi driver even though he loathes and fears his clientele.  His reasons for taking the job, though unstated, are apparent:  Better to face the depravity of the streets than live alone with the uncertainty and emptiness within himself day in and day out.  When not working Travis sits alone in his dingy apartment, staring at the television with indifference, pours his anger into his diary and haunts seedy downtown porno theaters.  He feels a need to find something more, something outside of himself, but he doesn't know what it could be.  Before too long he finds a cause, a reason to exist, in the form of the beautiful campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and, later, the plight of teen-runaway Iris (Jodie Foster).  He wants to be with them, to protect them, but do they want that?  Do they need that?

Bickle is a great character, for me anyway, because he's just a first-rate, if highly exaggerated and malformed, representation of the conflicts that breed in many people, particularly young men, I think. (Myself included.)  Bickle is a pure embodiment of idealism/romanticism curdling into bitter cynicism; the former, however, never totally dies and serves as fuel for the latter.  Travis acutely feels the sort of hopelessness that comes with this perspective; there's nothing Bickle can do, nothing logical, anyway, that will make any difference in the depraved world,  so he mindlessly loathes the darkness and clings to the few remaining misplaced threads of idealism (Placed in the two women he obsesses over, neither of whom much resembles what he imagines them to be) a coping method which inexorably leads to his final explosion.  As far as personal reflections go I, and almost all of us who can feel for Travis, aren't 1/1000 as messed up and nutty as he is, but the reflection is still there and that makes him really hit home.  You can't excuse his behavior, nor does the film ask you to, but you can see where he's coming from.  (Well, for the most part.  Some of the leaps he makes are pretty out there, but he *is* a nut...)

I haven't said all that much about the plot so far, but there isn't really that much to say.  Travis drives the cab, fixates on the two females, muses on and on and eventually loses it at the violent finale.  But man, there are some great individual scenes stuffed in this frame:  Travis picks up a deranged man (played by Scorsese) who gives a chilling monologue about his plans to punish his unfaithful spouse; Travis converses with Wizard (A great turn from Peter Boyle) about life; We see Bickle's bizarre training regimen in his apartment as he prepares for the end; Travis humiliates himself horribly when he tries to go after Betsy. These individually great scenes all come together in climax that is absolutely stunning and brutal.

A few odds and ends:

- I love the criticism of politicians found here.  The film just has Palantine talk for some time and he *never* comes close to saying anything meaningful.  You can't fight your way through the slogans and double-talk, cause that's all there is.

- ""Taxi Driver"" has some effective humor in it for such a bleak film.  I particularly enjoy the lie-filled letter Travis composes to his parents towards the end.

- I'm not a huge fan of the score.  It works well in the most dramatic scenes but, as usual, Hermann never lets off.  He's always overblown beyond belief.

- I don't have a strong position on whether the ending is reliable or not.  Both ways work for me.

Yeah, that's it.  Brilliant movie.

13424,5,0767830555,"Everyone's favorite disturbed sentimental favorite cabbie drives on. Even after 30 years, Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" still hits a familiar nerve with it's audience whether new or old. As Travis Bickell, Robert DeNiro plays one of his most well-known roles. His anguish and disgust for all things wrong are intensified with his job and living situation. As a cab driver in a city (NYC) that has it's fair of poverty, crime, and unsanitary conditions, Travis becomes an inevitable time-bomb ready to blow up.

There is more to Travis though as he does recognize his surroundings and assumes a self role as an important person in the solution of what aches him. His target is a popular political
candidate. His journey though is side tracked by a lovely
distraction (Cybil Sheppard). At the same time Travis monitors the actions of a very young prostitute (Jody Foster) to ""free"" her of the madness around her. So, what we actually have is a
multi-tasking emotionally disturbed individual in a collision course with history.

What many viewer see themselves in Travis is his disgust for
things in need of repair/disposal. His intentions and actions were extreme though, but his aim was arguably true. Another 30
years or so and Travis' story will still matter.",1157500800,,1262,5.004761904761905
13425,5,0767830555,"Its not often that you come across a movie so completely dominated by one character. True, no character in the movie is as fleshed out as De Niro's - Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel & Jodi Foster to name a few, all play important roles but none of them so completely dominates the screen as De Niro. And it is in this characterization and its treatment do we see directorial brilliance.

At its heart, the story (and probably this is just my interpretation) is about Solitude and one mans search purpose to his existence. De Niro stars as a Taxi Driver, drifting mostly, searching for a cause to hook himself to. But he also seems like your typical slightly-above-intelligence guy who tires of his purpose and explains it away or does something about it. So he's in the army and leaves, and has strange quirks like being unable to sleep much. He decides to date Cybill, campaign for the presidential candidate, rescue a child-prostitute, dream himself as a secret agent on an important mission etc. The movie is sometimes hilarious, especially when De Niro's character shaves his head as a punk and attempts to pursue the cause of cleaning-up-society.

But on the darker side, the movie deals with a man and his experience with solitude, the kind of fantasies he develops to help him get thru the monotony and how these fantasies soon start to control him and the line between imagination and reality blurs, where the movie and viewer unite in an unrivaled and unparalleled movie viewing experience. Probably one of the best movies on the darker side.",1155772800,2,1550,4.779850746268656
13426,5,0767830555,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver was one of the most contreversial films of the 1970's, winner of the prestigous Palme d'Or award (Best Film) at the Cannes film festival, and nominated for many prestigous awards at the BAFTAS and the Academy Awards. This film shot Scorsese, De Niro, and Foster under the lime light. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, and one of his finest films to date.

Taxi Driver opens with a dreamy opening sequence where we see Travis Bickel gliding through the streets of New York city with superb imagery and colours. This story follows the uneducated and somewhat disturbed man that goes by the name of Travis Bickle, he gets a job as a cab driver because he can't get any sleep. As he does his job he starts seeing and experience the dirty, gritty, and savage side of New York nobody ever sees, the story is narrated to us by Travis and gives us a chance to get inside his head. Travis then starts watching a women that goes by the name of Betsy, she works as an aide to New York State Senator Charles Palentine who is a nominated candidate in the presidential elections, he claims she's an angel in all this chaos and decides to talk to her and ask her out to a movie. Travis also starts to a plan to clean the 'scum' off the street, and starts stalking the senator Palentine. One of the key plots in the story is his obsession for saving a twelve and a half year old prostitute named Iris from this immoral world (through his mind) that lies around him.

This film is a piece of excellent art rather than a ""movie"". The Direction from Scorsese once again is masterfull, the cinematography is one of the many treasures that can be found in this film. The wonderful score fits perfectly with the narration and imagery. Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant in this, he does a wonderful job that is the disturbed Travis Bickle, but the rest of the cast shouldn't be overlooked as well, the characters are excellently played by Foster as the prostitute Iris, Keitel as the pimp 'Sport', Shepherd as Betsy, and Brooks as Tom. The characters are superbly written by the screenwriter Paul Schrader
and are fantasticly directed by Martin Scorsese.

All in all this is a superbly crafted film by Scorsese and should definately be on the film junkie's shelf. But, this won't be for everyone's taste, people will find it too disturbing, violent and dark. So I wouldn't reccomend watching it with your girlfriend or mom, or any woman who are easily upset or sensitive. But you haven't watched a Scorsese film until you've watched Taxi Driver. My highest reccomendation.

The special features on the disc are average. There's a very interesting and highly deatailed making of the film, with all the people who were involved in the making of the film, Scorsese, Schrader, Keitel, Foster, Shepherd, Brooks, and ofcourse De Niro. The documentry is 70 minutes long, but is a great way to find out the details of what went into the film. Other features include: a trailer, interactive full script of the film, this means you can change to the movie and back to the script to see what they changed and what they kept. Advertising material, like posters and promotional stuff. Sadly there's no commentry but the documentary itself is worth a watch with the film.

 The film is compelling there is no doubt of that but is that a good thing? With a book like Crime and Punishment where the character murders, the author at least shows the consequences of such a deed both inwardly and in the world.

 With Taxi Driver the climax is the violence, it is the insanity. An insane man saying 'you talking to me' is cool and funny. Travis is the hero, an insane man who murders and tries to assasinate people is looked up to and idolized. Thats a hallmark of Scorcese films and why I don't like a lot of his work. He shows the seductiveness and romanticism of satanic actions and people, but brings too much sympathy to them, too much idolization. Instead of showing the real consequences of these dark impulses, Scorsese seems to be infatuated with them and splashes them pornographically across the screen for his own amusement.

 This film is seductive yes, but certainly unhealthy.",1151884800,15,1082,4.698412698412699
13428,4,0767830555,"I want to commend Stanley Allen for his review on this site.  He suggests that the closing scenes are imagined by Travis Bickle as he is dying.  They include the gratitude and respect of Iris's parents, and the return of Betsy, who he now gets the better of by rejecting her instead of the other way around.  I didn't see it that way as I watched the film, but I see it that way now.  Those are exactly the scenes Travis would imagine.  That is exactly the kind of hero he would like to be.  Respectable, desired, and the savior of a young girl who will now go back to school and be good.  It's hard to tell which he would get more satisfaction from - being invited to dinner by Iris's parents or being adored by Betsy.  I think he'd pick Iris's parents.  This makes him a true hero, a clean hero.

The interview accompanying the movie as a Special Feature is very informative but too long, an hour.  We learn that the teenage prostitute that Iris is based on is really in the movie.  She is the girl who is with Iris.  She looks like a drugged out whore, and that's what she is.  She looks like she has dead shark eyes.  I've seen lots of junkies with those same dead shark eyes.  Iris looks very innocent by comparison.

Iris is a very cleaned up version of a teenage whore.  She is unrealistically cleaned up.  She is palatable for the movie audience but she is unrealistic, as she herself knows, as her mother knew when she saw the script.  Likewise, her pimp is not the original pimp written in the script.  Her pimp is a white man, and not really unlikeable.  He never hits her, he gives her a lot of affection, he holds her head tenderly and whispers to her sweetly, he has a sense of humor.  The original pimp in the script was black, and pimps are known for brutality.  This is almost a Disney pimp, if we can imagine such a thing.

As for Travis Bickle, he's nuts.  You want to root for him, but you can only do that to a point because he is nuts.  He is extremely well played by DeNiro.

I thought that Travis took Betsy to a dirty movie because he is stupid, not realizing that it is inappropriate for a first date with a respectable girl, but the interview explained that Travis wanted to sully Betsy even though he was obviously drawn to her because she was clean.  I overrated his stupidity and underrated his deviousness.  Since I didn't ""get it"" the way it was intended, perhaps DeNiro and Scorsese didn't show it as they wanted to.  I can't be expected to read his mind.  That's their job.

I highly recommend this movie.  I don't always recommend classics like this.  I often punch holes in them and rate them 1 or 2 stars.  This is deservedly a classic.",1151020800,2,2673,4.286573146292585

The film (unlike the hopeless ""Summer of Sam"" by Spike Lee) captures in a very visceral and frightening way, the New York City of the 70's. From the opening scene with the lights from the porno theaters reflected off Travis Bickle's face to the end where the same theaters reflect in the mirror shows the oppressive terror that people felt about N.Y.C. and especially Times Square. If you watch it enough times, you'll notice that every scene has imagery that is stating something further. When Travis Bickle goes to meet up with the Jodie Foster character for the first time you hear church bells ringing in the background.  The Belmore cafeteria was a real life hang out for cab drivers and the scenes there are of every day life, hustling for a living. Of course, Robert DeNiro's portrayal of Travis Bickle is over the top but Travis Bickle is a character that, however guiltily people are forced to identify with (such as ""Alex"" in Clockwork Orange). Also, without bringing up the topic, the idea of the Vietnam vet that has become psychotic and lost his humanity (an interesting, although much lesser film would be Deathdream where a Vietnam vet who returns is literally a murderous zombie)and can only redeem it through ""saving"" someone else was just beginning to be explored at the time. The views of the checker cabs and the bygone Times Square as a squalid frightening place have been ""disappeared"".  Bernard Hermann's score of smooth jazz with the elements of rage suddenly boiling over in symphonic flashes is perfect for the movie. Screenwriter Paul Schrader is picturing a form of Dante's Inferno located on earth. Unlike the morally indefensible Deathwish (not to be confused with the above Deathdream), Charles Bronson's vehicle to stardom, Taxi Driver has a humanity in it. Travis Bickle is doomed by his own destruction, the ending showing that he is a ticking time bomb that is just being reset. Martin Scorcese, especially in combination with Robert DeNiro and Harvey Kietel has made many films that will stand the test of time but Taxi Driver is his masterwork.",1144195200,3,2185,4.870967741935484

He's searching for love in all the wrong places...and doesn't know why.

I think the movie delivers several powerful messages...one of which someone already mentioned- taking matters into your own hands and doing what you want to change things around you that you don't like-and then also I think it pointed out very blantely how much people put on a front- when really inside there lives are filled with things they hate.

Say, for the sake of argument, that that's what they meant and intended...well, then, I'd say it's pure genius on their part. However, I doubt it.

With those four words, a legend was born.

What more is there to say about Taxi Driver that hasn't already been said? Disturbing, gritty, dark, compelling... masterpiece.

Robert De Niro stars as Travis Bickle, who describes himself as ""God's lonely man"". He takes a job driving taxis because he can't sleep nights, and if he's going to roam New York City anyway, he might as well get paid for it. From here on out, the movie takes us INSIDE Travis's head. His thoughts, his feelings, his obsessions, his loneliness. This is why, although he is portrayed as a nut, the audience sort of feels for Travis (for the most part anyway). The viewer understands what is making him want to violently lash out at the messed-up world. We witness firsthand why he wants someone to ""just flush this city right down the [edit] toilet!""

This movie portrays mid-70's NYC to a T. The hookers, pimps, pushers, they're all here, and they're all chipping away at Travis Bickle's sanity (what little he has left, anyway).

The two most pivotal points in the movie: when Travis finally meets an attractive woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and asks her out on a date, but screws it up badly... although Travis meant well (he honestly didn't know any better), Betsy decides to just ignore him. This is a situation almost all of us have been in, whether or not we took someone to a movie like that, and that only helps us sympathize with Travis.

The other pivotal point is when Travis meets a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis sees Iris as tied down, being stripped of her innocence and youth, and that he has to save her by any means necessary.

The best thing about Taxi Driver is that it doesn't give any easy answers. Is Travis Bickle a hero or a nutbar? And, most importantly, was Travis dead in the last scene, or is that really what happened? It is left up to the viewer to decide.

So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it (if you're not faint of heart, anyway). It's a classic, it made Bobby De Niro a legend, and it's a great movie to slap ""Torque"" in the face with.

""Taxi Driver"" is more than just a great movie, it's frighteningly real and incredibly powerful.

Anyone who tells you that this movie is boring or that it meanders is horrendously missing the point.  This is an incredibly well-realized movie, masterfully paced, and evocative.  There is some great black humor in ""Taxi Driver"", but its primary impact is psychological, and in turn, emotional.  The movie tends to be very low-key, but in a continuously arrestingly and usually creepy way.  A ton of the credit for this of course goes to Robert De Niro for his incredible lead performance as the crippingly lonely cabbie Travis Bickle, a man of contrasts who's disturbed to the very core of his being.  Seeing Iris, a 12-year-old prostitute remarkably portrayed by Jodie Foster, ultimately pushes Bickle to the very brink.  The movie's post-shootout finale, which I agree is clearly a fantasy from Bickle's mind, is a hauntingly powerful stroke of genius.

The casting is amazing all around.  Harvey Keitel is right in his element, with a terrific performance as Sport, aka ""the pimp"".  Peter Boyle is great as the so-called ""Wizard"", Albert Brooks adds some lighthearted humor to the proceedings where appropriate, and the wonderful Cybill Shepherd is as mesmerizing as ever.  Even Martin Scorsese is absolutely brilliant filling in a bit part as a homicidal passenger in Travis' cab.

""Taxi Driver"" additionally hints at Scorsese's excellent musical taste by using Jackson Browne's ""Late For The Sky"" in the soundtrack.  The song's appearance in the film is a little jarring, but quite fitting, and it IS one of the best songs ever written.

The making-of documentary featured in the 1999 ""Collector's Edition"" is highly worthwhile, containing interview segments from Scorsese, De Niro, Shepherd, Boyle, Foster, Keitel, Brooks, Schrader, etc., providing fascinating insight.  It becomes apparent that the essence of Paul Schrader's screenplay was at once captured while also being appropriately flashed out thanks to Scorsese and the incredibly talented actors.  The movie itself has been remastered, and the sound and picture quality are pristine.

If you don't have it already, this ""Collector's Edition"" is the way to go.  ""Taxi Driver"" deserves to be hailed as one of the very best movies ever, and any serious viewer should appreciate it.",1129680000,6,2609,5.125295508274232
13447,5,0767830555,"Travis Bickle is a social pariah. He can't sleep and needs something to do, so he decides to work the night shift as a New York City cabbie. Travis ruminates (in his journal?) about his difficulties making companionships in his life as well as his dislike for all the filth on the streets. Travis's loneliness, a more concrete manifestation of his alienation problem, is a driving force for his nose dive into psychosis. He hates what he sees in the city until Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) appears as a beacon of light on the street dressed in white. His pursuit of Betsy describes his manic quest for unobtainable companionship and purity. Yet, while his behavior indicates his loneliness, Travis consistently doesn't really know why he keeps behaving badly and often sabotages his own attempts to end his loneliness. For example, his date with Betsy is made unbearable by poor choice of movie. Loneliness is the emotional manifestation of the alienation Travis experiences; it is both a source of great pain and a source of psychosis. He does not understand common social topics, such as popular music, politics or love. His failed attempt at conventional companionship with Betsy leads to his warped effort to be a knight errant for young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster).

Travis's psychotic descent ends in a trail of destruction and blood. To save Iris from her life of prostitution, he becomes an army of one. All pimps and Mafiosos in his way die a brutal death. After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Travis dies quietly on the couch as the authorities enter the building (interesting camera angle). Then, the strange denouement begins. The ending must be seen as a brief flash of his life. The closing scene reflects how Travis would like his life to be remembered. Director Martin Scorsese utilized a similar method in ""Last Temptation of Christ"" when Jesus sees his life as would be if he got down from the cross. In movie time, the scene takes about a half hour, but the scene only takes a flash to play in Jesus' head prior to his actual death on the cross. Whereas Jesus fantasizes about life as a mortal and dies as a savior, Travis fantasizes about being a savior and dies as a mortal. During last scenes of Taxidriver, Travis dreams himself as a hero who makes amends with Betsy, receives a grateful letter form Iris's parents and makes friends with his fellow cabbies. The last scene is just a pre-morbid flash in his mind before his lights go out for eternity.

Taxidriver is set in the pre-Giuliani streets of New York, depicted with all its sin and psychosis. Nighttime in New York is filled with explosive violence, pervasive cynicism, and ubiquitous prostitutes. Director Martin Scorsese even indulges himself in such small details as a depiction of a street drummer, traveling gun salesman, and failed store robbery as side trips in Travis's long journey. Travis's disgust for the streets is depicted in his need to clean the semen and blood off his seats after his shift is over.

Several small events act as harbingers to Travis's violent rampage. Travis is made to listen to a customer's (played by Martin Scorsese) ravings while the philandering wife's silhouette is visible from the street. The customer discloses to Travis the merits of the 357 magnum and what it will do to his wife when he shoots her. Also, while innocently shopping at a local grocery store, Travis successfully breaks up a robbery.

Awesome movie. What a cast: De Niro, Shepherd, Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle. But the best character may be the streets of the city themselves. Scorsese gives the cold pavement of New York an actual living presence in the movie. Smoke, water, blood, grit.",1129593600,,3708,4.871632329635499

13449,5,0767830555,"I know few films in which the main character lives in a bigger contradiction. ""Taxi Driver"" depicts Travis Bickle, a man who desperately wants to wipe out everyone around him as much as he wants to embrace them. The action takes place in the New York suburbs and is somewhat of an exercise in style that works just right from beginning to end.

Hollywood has a history of interesting director-actor relationships of which the Scorsese/De Niro association is perhaps one of the most remarkable, starting with ""Mean Streets"", having its climax precisely with ""Taxi Driver"" only three years later and going on through ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Cape Fear"" and ""Casino"". Looking at these titles, you get my point when I say it is a remarkable association, don't you?

""Taxi Driver"" is arguably the pinnacle in Scorsese's career, too. It's hard to make such claim for such a talented and fruitful director, but this movie is that good. It works on so many levels and is so real and down to earth that every bit of action strikes you really hard and a lot of it you can actually relate to.

In one of the most famous scenes ever, Travis says: ""You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here."" And that was too true. He really was alone.",1128729600,2,1233,4.621004566210046

13451,4,0767830555,"It's fascinating reading the divergent opinions of Taxi Driver, both here and among working critics; what's fascinating is that I tend to agree with most all of them!

When this film made its initial theater run in 1976, I was totally blown away (no pun intended!) by its unique cinematic style; a sort of introspective color noir dripping with modern operatic expressionism.  We experienced the salacious and gritty Big Apple street life from the cynical perspective of an alienated young cabbie--manifested through Paul Schrader's dark introspective first-person narrative, the sheen of Michael Chapman's surrealistic night cinematography, and Bernard Herrmann's alternately pensive and powerful scoring--brought together beautifully by director Martin Scorsese's obvious feel for the subject and milieu. It managed to strike a chord with many in the midst of the post-Watergate era...and unfortunately struck a wrong chord with a certain John Hinckley, but that's another story.

The ""romantic"" opening slo-mo shot of a yellow cab emerging from a cloud of billowing steam to the progressively rapid beating of a one-handed snare drum sets a dark underlying malevolent tone, and for the most part, that tone is maintained through to the end credits. We meet Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a twenty-six year old ex-Marine who suffers acute insomnia and harbors an utter contempt for what he perceives to be the filth of his urban surroundings and all the depravity it engenders. He takes a job as an all-night hack in a bid to quell his anxiety. The tone is interrupted only by Bickle's inept attempts at social intercourse, especially with a beautiful ""uptown"" campaign worker named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd, whose presence reminds one of no less than Claudia Cardinale's idealized woman in Fellini's 8 1/2). However, the viewer always senses Travis's lingering malevolence just beneath the surface.  A chance meeting with Betsy's candidate gives him a brief but prominent locus for his frustrations, what can't be given by his colleague cabbies (including Wizard, memorably played by Peter Boyle), but it also eventually gives him a locus for a misdirected ""sense of purpose"". Later, another female/male pairing engages this ""purpose"" as Travis tries to befriend a pubescent prostitute named Iris (a young Jodie Foster) who works under the ""aegis"" of a slimy pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel).  The narrative eventually boils to an explosively violent climax.

Though I found the personae of both Ms. Shepherd and Ms. Foster somewhat off-putting and incongruous, their respective characters serve the narrative well.  A Betsy who's a little less ""ideally beautiful"" and an Iris who's a little more mature would have suited the tone of the film much better, in my opinion.  Travis's abject social ineptitude belies his Marine training (A porno flick on a first date?  C'mon!), not to mention the absurdity of Betsy having anything to do with Travis in the first place. (I never knew Kris Kristofferson could so warp a beautiful woman's senses!)  One could point out a myriad of such incongruities in Taxi Driver; but I must admit that the possibility of the film's coda being Travis's dying fever dream never crossed my mind. It would certainly make more sense than a straight literal reading and puts an added interesting spin on it.  Any shortcomings aside, the film's sheer ""cinematicism"" is truly a wonder and a reason to have it in one's collection.  De Niro's portrayal of ""God's lonely man"" is one of the most memorable in late twentieth century American filmdom, only to be surpassed by him a few years later in Scorsese's masterpiece Raging Bull.",1127174400,3,3655,5.207836456558773
13462,5,0767830555,"A simplistic plot, yet such fierce writing, acting and directing make this a must-see for anyone who calls themself a  film buff.

Taxi Driver tells the story of Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who is a loner on the streets of New York, and drives a taxi on the night shift.  Travis is slowly slipping into severe depression with the 'scum on the streets' he sees whilst driving his cab at night. 'They're all animals anyway. All the animals come out at night: (...), skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal... Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.'

Thus marks Travis' hopes for the future of New York. But when this doesn't appear to be taking affect, he decides to take matters into his own hands, sparked off by some encounters with a few individuals.  The first of which is Betsy, a campaign worker for a presidential candidate, whom Travis spots at the candidate's headquaters - 'That taxi driver has been staring at us' - and attempts to woo. However his idea of this is a little different from most people's, when on their first date he takes to her to a porn film, which she promtly walks out of.

The next of whom is an underage hooker and her pimp, the former being named Iris, the latter 'Sport'. Travis is both shocked and angry to find out Iris is only 12 years old, and attempts to persuade her to desert her pimp and return to her parents, of which he also fails.

Driven by his manic depression and overwhelming powerlessness, he buys four handguns and sets out do something which may turn him from a nobody into a somebody...

Robert De Niro's performance in this film changed my opinion of him forever.  Before I thought he was just some overrated has-been who always acted the same in every movie (if you can belive that!). His performance is so powerful and so sure I couldn't believe he wasn't Travis Bickle. I was genuinely suprised when I learned he hadn't won the Best Actor Oscar.  I was disappointed too - his has become one of my favourite performances of all time.  I even got a bit of a crush on him after seeing this film (he was handsome back then).

The supporting performances are all excellent too, in particular young Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel. Foster, never a generic beauty but a competent and capable actress, gives one of the best performances of her career.  And Keitel, well he's Harvey Keitel, still cool, still perfect, just with dark brown hair and a young face.

Vivid and inspired direction from Martin Scorsese, and a top notch screenplay from Paul Schrader, ultimaltely makes Taxi Driver one of those films you can watch again and again without losing interest and one of my perosnal favourites. Highly recommened.",1123977600,,2731,4.639004149377594
13463,5,0767830555,"The masterpiece ""Taxi Driver"" tells the tragic story of a certain Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine who gets a night job as cabby driver to while away his sleepless nights. His lonely work makes him aware of an array of bizarre and vicious characters, and he feels the urgent need of a big rain that would wash away ""all this scum"", like a deluge. Living an aimless life, he comes across a woman, Betsy, that stands out in the wasteland of the big city as a promise of redemption. But his best hopes are disappointed by the revulsion Betsy feels for his strange ways. In his quest for a meaningful life, he turns to a young prostitute, tries to rescue her, and finally plays the avenger of outraged innocense in the bloody end of the story, which is not for every taste. ""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness, the sense of purity which it breeds, and the desire to chastise the corrupt world, embodied in the ""low life pimp"" that Bickle hates so much. The blood bath at the end seems to stand for a purifying ritual. I utterly agree with those who consider the very end of the story, so incongruent with the rest, as Bickle's delirium in the verge of death. The mood of self-justification is only too obvious and fits perfectly with the character. ""Taxi Driver"" is a movie to be studied, one of the finest examples of cinematic art.",1123459200,3,1322,4.4896265560165975
13464,2,0767830555,"Didn't see this movie back in the 70's, and never intended to until I recognized that a lot of Amazon reviewers compared ""One Hour Photo"" (a film I thought was excellent) with ""Taxi Driver"". So I relented and eagerly viewed the DVD, only to berate myself for having been duped.

Briefly - ""Taxi Driver"" is the story of Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine turned NYC cab driver; a young man who ""means well"" but is a macho character with s*** for brains (kind of like the creators of this movie, I'm sorry to say). Anyone who hasn't sense enough not to take a woman to a smutty movie loses my interest and sympathy pretty quickly. Bickle is his own worst enemy; he doesn't have the patience or wherewithal to apply himself to get educated, etc. to make life better for himself and others. He just wants life to improve, NOW! OK, sure. So he instigates some bloodshed and death, and somehow sometime winds up a sort-of hero. HUH?

I tried to get some insight on the HUH? part by viewing the ""documentary"" section of the DVD, but I just couldn't muddle all the way through it. It was full of nothing but ego-driven minutiae; details about stuff no sane person would care about (yawn), so I gave up and will happily dispatch the DVD back to the Public Library today and wash my hands of it. The End.

PS What WAS interesting however, is the fact that this movie was made back when parts of NYC were so blighted that one could buy a Park Avenue co-op for the price (in today's $$$) of a used car. One of my relations did just that.",1122595200,5,1518,4.3568904593639575
13465,4,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is obviously a classic.  It has inspired numerous filmmakers and further established the career of Robert De Niro as one of the preeminent actors of our time.  The story is about Travis Bickle (De Niro) who, to quote Pauline Kael's review, ""has no point of entry into human society.""  Bickle turns to his violent fantasies after a campaign worker (Cybill Shepherd) rejects him- and thus his final attempt to connect with other people.  This culminates in a famous scene of heinous violence. But just because a film is about disconnection doesn't necessarily mean that it has to diconnect its audience.  Ultimately, that's how I felt.  Here's why.

-It's meandering.

This is a film with many shots- carefully planned and technically beautiful shots.  But at times, they seem to exist in of themselves and not to further the story, the character, or the mood.  The shot going into a foaming glass of alka seltzer being just one example.  These shots eventually add up and contribute to a sense of tedium.  Also, the endless scenes of De Niro in his apartment eating cereal, practicing with his guns, or watching TV start to feel like exercises, revealing little that we don't already know.

-Travis Bickle is inexplicable.

In order to watch for 2 plus hours essentially a one-character tragedy, that one character has to be interesting.  As Schrader's script is written though, Travis isn't as compelling as he should.  De Niro's performance is good, especially in his early scenes when his social ineptitude towards Cybill Shepherd's character is sweetly endearing (he takes her to a porno theater on a date and can't figure out why she's offended).  And when he says to his cabbie friend (played by Peter Boyle) that he's worried about ""bad ideas"" you see a man slipping from sanity, while at the same time trying to preserve his morality by ""saving"" a young prostitute (Jodie Foster). These short scenes of De Niro interacting speak volumes, and it's unfortunate that Scorsese and Schrader primarily chose to depict De Niro through his rituals, which as I said earlier, have little nuance and feel static.

With that all said, there's enough good in Taxi Driver to obviously warrant a viewing.  A few examples:

-The New York City setting

Everything about this film evokes the scuzziness of New York City in the 1970's.  Scorese films the potholes, hookers, pimps, and porno theaters with such contempt that we fully understand why Travis hates it.  The place is a sewer, and the pimp (played by Harvey Keitel) that Travis targets is a symbol of how hellish the city is.

-Jodie Foster

I really liked Jodie Foster's supporting performance as the 12-year old prostitute, Iris.  She's only in a few short scenes but she captures the innocence-gone-bad that Travis so despises.  In one scene, she's just a regular kid, eating some toast and giggling, and yet she's been thrust into this disgusting world.

-The Palantine Subplot

The artificial stump speeches of presidential candiate, Senator Palantine and the septic bourgeois banter between Betsy (Cybill) and her friend (Albert Brooks) is chilling in an odd way.  It's as though the political campaign symbolizes a ""civilized"" and benevolent society, and yet it is completely oblivious to the hell that is out there, and thus allows the Irises and Travises of the world to suffer.  One of Palpatine's talking points is ending poverty and crime.  And yet, when he talks to Bickle in a cabbie by chance, his phony political good-guy schtick is perversely transparent, and it's clear that he isn't interested in genuine connection- which this film argues- propels crime and violence.

Anyway, I recommend seeing Taxi Driver.  It's a good movie- a bonafide classic.  It's not as emotional or visceral as it should be, and falls into tedious lapses, but that doesn't detract from the influence it has had or the power it still can have over audiences.",1121472000,4,3914,4.960061443932411
13466,5,0767830555,"Martin Scorsese grew up in New York. He loves the city, and knows it well. In Taxi Driver, one of his first large successes, he drew a hauntingly poetic image of its dark underbelly. The main character, Travis Bickle, is a disenfranchised Vietnam veteran that can't sleep. So he starts driving taxis. He tells that audience that every morning when he returns the cab, he has to wipe the cum off the seats. Sometimes, he also has to wipe off blood.

This is the setup for the movie, which is not so much about plot as Bickel's slow descent into madness. Some of the plot points that lead to the movie's violent, anarchic ending: Bickle falls for a beautiful young woman working for a politician's election campaign, he meets a twelve year old prostitue and her pimp, and he is disgusted by the city's scum, which is developed by his meeting with the pimp.

But more interesting than any of those things is Bickle, and his inner troubles. He hates himself for being socially inept, evidenced by his date with the beautiful woman, in which he takes her to a porno theater, and she runs away from him. Later, for reasons that are only apparent if you see the movie, Bickle buys guns and practices drawing them in front of a mirror. He then gives the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" speech.

Now, to the ending. Many people have different theories as to whethet or not he really died. In my opinion, it is irrelevant what happens to him. The whole movie has an aura of dreaminess. And the final shot, of Bickle looking in the mirror and seeing no reflection, is less an example of proving he isn't alive than a simple, haunting shot. Scorsese should have won the Oscar for Taxi Driver.",1120953600,3,1676,4.506578947368421
13467,3,0767830555,"I was very dissapointed by this Martin Scorsese film. It had the good actors, the good plot, but seemed just weird. Without all of the necessary pieces, it ends out being an average movie. De Niro plays a cabbie who drives nonstop becomes he can't sleep as he is haunted by memories of Vietnam. He then falls for a woman played by Cybil Sheppard as well as later falls for a prostitute played by a young Jodie Foster.

De Niro's character is driven to madness and buys guns so that he can save Foster from her kidnappers. He gets a mohawk and has some classic lines like ""you talking to me?"". But, ultimately, I was bored by this movie that just seemed to go nowhere. I was lost at some moments and didn't even really realize that he was trying to save Foster at the end. I knew it because he had given her money for her to flee but the scene comes out of nowhere and is very brutal, bloody and unnecessary. This movie felt like a waste of my time and I was very dissapointed.

On the other hand, everyone else seems to love this movie. I guess I just don't understand this because the movie felt boring to me and just unnecessary.

But, I'm sure that no one will listen to me as I'm different than all of the other reviews and I'm the guy that fell asleep during two viewing of Alien. ( It wasn't nightime)

His portrayal is astoundingly uncanny and personal, yet Travis still remains tantalizingly mysterious (I credit this aspect more to Scorsese's directing and Paul Schrader's story). To some degree, I believe every man can relate to Travis's experience. We have all felt the loneliness and isolation, we have all felt the sexual frustration, we have all felt the blood-boiling rage; and, of course, we have all wanted to own a small handgun that we could slide out of our sleeve on a rail so we could shoot a worthless pimp.

In Martin Scorsese's breakneck film American audiences are treated to a brutal scrutiny of their own existence, whether it be the absurdity of party politics or the ever present danger of city life autonomy.

The title character, one Travis Bickle, is played to disturbing perfection by Robert Deniro.  His gradual descent into self absorbed delusion results in one of film's most fascinating (and down right creepy) characters.  The conveyance of gentility coupled with madness has never been done better.

Jodie Foster, as the damsel prostitute, gives a performance that borders on the impossible.  How an actress at that age could possibly play a hooker that convincingly either belies an eerily acute level of observation skills or a very poor upbringing.  I'd say her two Academy Awards probably eliminate the latter option.

Taxi Driver has become an American fable, complete with heroes, villains, violence, and compassion.  A solid, complex film that defined urban drama and raised the bar for stark realism in film.  Besides, it inspired a presidential assassination attempt.  Obviously the film speaks to madmen, but it also echoes in the minds of the supposedly sane.

This was a great movie from director Martin Scorsese. This was the first time I ever saw this movie and I was very impressed with how well Scorsese handled it. Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances of his career in this film and it's definitely worth seeing just for that. Jodie Foster was great in her supporting role, even if her character is so controversial (she's a child prostitute). All of Scorsese's films have this certain controlled madness to them. I think you can see it in this movie most of all, but it's also very apparent in his most recent film, The Aviator. He's so good at dealing with psychological disorders in his characters.

13487,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is an intense portrayal of a man slowly being driven mad by his isolation and loneliness.  Although Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) lives in NY, the largest city in the world, his inability to construct and maintain relationships with other people has led to insomnia and progressively towards violent insanity.  He seems to have only one friend, the Wizard (Peter Boyle), a fellow taxi driver with whom he maintains an awkwardly trusting relationship, but even that contact with another person is largely superficial and deeply flawed.  On his downward spiral, he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepard), a woman whose company gives him hope to become ""like other people"".  Ultimately, though, his warped personality drives her away and sends him deeper into his own personal hell.

Now grasping for an outlet for his violent nature, we see two sides to his personality.  On the one hand, he's a vengeful jilted man and makes an abortive attempt to strike back at Betsy by assassinating the political candidate that she works for.  On the other, he's a justice seeking vigilante who commits himself to cleaning up the sewer the city has become.  He finds Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12 year-old prostitute and acquires the weaponry to free her from ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), the man who sells her body for $15/15 minutes.  The final melee is one of the grittiest shootouts ever on film.

DeNiro and Scorsese have created a masterful picture.  I was completely drawn into Travis Bickle's life and his desperate sense of lonliness.  His hope of emerging from his seclusion and desperation at being unable to do so are carried in every frame.  This is a movie that will stay with you for years.",1115164800,5,1685,4.911660777385159

It aims at two audiences, crime noir fans and the Travis Bickle-ites, and for a time I felt very much like 'ol Travis myself. Love, acceptance, sanity, these were things that were alien to his mind, and when you live in a world, no, a city, where you're a thread away from becoming another faceless drone in the sea of insanity around you, it is a truly depressing thought because it's not a question of 'if' but rather a question of 'when'. The moment Travis Bickle topples the television set over with his foot, his downward spiral truly begins in horrific fashion.

It holds up to this day as a truly unforgettable film because every single person who had a hand in making it worked in perfect harmony to craft what could have been a simple reel of film into a gem. The creepy, soft jazz-laden music score by Bernard Hermann, the hypnotic cinematography, the top-notch directing by Marty Scorcese, the disturbing yet insightful screenplay by Paul Schrader, and one of the best performances by a young DeNiro, all prove that you're not only watching a movie, you're watching cinema.

13489,5,0767830555,"I don't normally review things because I don't have the word power to express things like other reviewers do, but I have to say something. First of all, Taxi Driver is my favorite movie. Everything is perfect in this movie. I won't go into detail. I was browsing through the comments to see if anyone could say something negative about this classic and to my suprise I found some. I saw that someone said they ending ruined the movie. I was completely in awe when I saw that. The ending just makes this movie even better. The final shootout is one of the most poetic killing scenes ive ever seen. I also saw someone who rated the acting and violence low. This goes along with that one reviewer who said the thing about the fast and furious people. Deniros acting was so amazing. No one could probably play Travis Bickle as well as he could. I guess he didn't know that Robert made up the You Talkin To Me saying, which has become one of the most famous sayings in our time. And the violence, think about it, it was late seventies, they weren't exactly making every movie a Triple X Vin Diesel action movie yet. My closing comment will be to the person who said he was porn loving. If you recall the scene where he took Betsy to the porn movie thinking everyone could enjoy it and then says he really doesnt know anything about movies is an obvious hint that the poor guy doesnt know a good one from a bad one.",1113782400,,1409,4.320754716981132

The other kids liked the (violent)ending. I liked it for everything else.  The performances Scorcese draws from his cast are absolutely astounding. De Niro, in (in my opinion) his career defining role, is utterly mesmerising. This fantastic movie will stay with you. You will find a tale as haunting as it's compelling score.

13491,5,0767830555,"but, if you've got the stomach and a curiosity about the non-Disney side of the human personality, this dark, insightful, and yes, violent, tale is for you.  What always gets me about this movie is DeNiro's performance.  DAMN!!!  He IS Travis Bickle.  That's how amazing his acting (in this) is-yet we know he isn't.  This is the 'Master of Puppets' (Metallica' best, and most powerful, album) for DeNiro.  The power of his performance here is beyond description.  How he got from 'Taxi Driver' to where he is today would make for another 'dark journey' movie...  By the way, for those reviewers who don't understand why he doesn't go to jail at the end, think about the kind of people he killed-the kind the police would just as soon kill themselves if they could get away with it.  He was doing the police a favor, in a weird sort of way.  Plus this is inner city NYC-nobody cares about these types of people anyway in 'this part of town'-you're on your own.  The making Travis out to be a hero was on purpose-to show how society has a twisted sense of rewarding the 'wrong people'-GET IT???  As for the color of the blood at the end, you should have watched the 'making of' part of the DVD-They talk about how the negatives for the original had deteriorated so much that they were not able to be saved.  If you just plain didn't like it, well, you can see you're in the minority.  Even if it's too violent for you, I don't see how you could ignore DeNiro's performance-it's why acting was invented, or Scorsese's (and crew) amazingly thick vibe that so perfectly complements DeNiro's tour de force performance.

13492,5,0767830555,"This is that one movie,that no matter where I am or what I'm doing, if it's on I'm sitting down to watch it even if I catch it in the middle.

 A very young, cut and delicious Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a twenty-six year old man out of the service, who is riddled with lonliness and sleeplessness. His mind is constantly realing with the disgust and filth that's rampaging the streets of New York with prostitution, drugs, pornography and physical trash. So he decides to place himself in the very middle of it by taking up a job as a cab driver, working day and night since he can't sleep anyway.

Constantly dissapointed whenever he believes there to be any goodness left, Travis is a man who decides he's not going to take it anymore. What I find most interesting is his fascination with all that he detests. For instance he is sick of the hookers and pimps smoothering the streets, yet he regularly visits X-rated movies with this child-like naivness. Is he fueling his rage, filling the void of human contact, is this some sort of self loathing punishment or is he the ""walking contradiction""?

 All Travis really wants (and perhaps it's his dissapointment after fighting in the Vietnam war and comming back to a life like this, without the respect or the quality of life he feels he deserves for being a soldier, which many vetrans were faced with) is to protect something that is worth protecting and to seperate himself from the filth that traps him. So he becomes the self appointed angel to a twelve and a half year old runaway hooker named Iris (played by Jodie Foster). To become reconized as the hero he may have been in the war (noticethe scars on his back during the excerise scene) which leads him into this horrific descent into hell.

I've also heard some dissapointment reguarding the color quality of this release. I'm glad it was left untouched. I feel it adds to the atmosphere of the seedy, gritty, raw streets of seventies New York City. It makes the hairs on my neck stand up. The slow dance into the final meltdown is taped on what looks like greasy film, sickening like Travis' enviorment. The final grisely scene where the camera floats over the hallway littered with guns and bodies, blood and dirt in every corner is tinged with this reddish-pinkish hugh, which (not sure if this was intended) gives the illusion that even the air is soaked in blood. I feel this is completey suiting.

This is an extremely intense, phsycological movie and one worth adding to any movie buff's collection.",1109116800,5,2526,4.650224215246637

The acting was good all around. I almost didn't recognize Jodi Foster as the young prostitute.

Because many film buffs have already seen the flick, it's probably better to discuss the bells and whistles contained within the DVD.  I have an old VHS copy that was beginning to lose its luster, so I added the Collector's Edition DVD to my library. Here are my thoughts on the ""extras"":

There is an excellent ""the making of"" documentary. De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Brooks, Boyle, Sheperd, Keitel, and even the screenwriter add their anecdotes. Find out exactly where they found the weird street drummer guy who's seen performing during Betsy and Travis' big date. Other tales are told with regard to the making of the film.

This DVD claims to contain the WIDESCREEN VERSION of the film; however, I find no difference between this version and my VHS full screen copy. Perhaps you see a quarter of an inch more of the picture, but nothing more. Why letterbox the full screen version? Either the theatrical release closely resembles the Full Screen version, or the Producer of the DVD thought no one would notice.

Although the Widescreen is nothing more than Full Screen inside a letter box, the Photo Montage surprises in a very good way. Instead of a silent slide show, the producer of the cd provides additional commentary on the making of Taxi Driver. You'll learn how the screenwriter named every character, and what lengths De Niro went to prepare for his performance.

If you're looking for a DVD to replace your VHS edition, then this is suitable; however, if you want a real Widescreen edition complete with audio commentary, then you should wait until the next ""Collector's Edition"" is released. With 2006 just around the corner, a 20th anniversary edition is sure to come.",1105228800,2,1802,4.781350482315113
13500,5,0767830555,"I realize a lot of people haven't seen this movie, so I'm not going to talk about it too much. I simply want to encourage anyone that hasn't seen it to take a chance and watch it. Sure, you may hate it and decide you've wasted 2 hours, but that's a small price to pay. What's worse is holding off seeing this classic. I'll go ahead and say it's one of my top 5 favorite films: It's one of my top 5 favorite films.

Scorsese takes a real sweet approach to this one. Travis Bickle (Deniro) is just a great character that benefits even more from the way Scorsese zeros in on him. The slow pace of the flick allows for some excellent plot development. Some might argue that this is boring. Don't listen to them. The movie should have you sucked in from the start. The dark, gloomy feeling, the mesmorizing jazz score and the loneliness that is Travis Bickle is fascinating stuff. I've seen this a few times and I can't emphasize how awesome the character of Travis is enough.

So I guess all i'm trying to say is ""Definitely get this!"" At the very least bring yourself to see it when it comes on a movie channel or something.",1103068800,2,1121,4.283018867924528
13501,4,0767830555,"Taxi Driver shocked movie audiences when it first came out in 1976.  People gasped out loud at DeNiro's graphic and casual reference to what went on in the backseat of his New York taxi. People were also extremely shocked by Jodie Foster playing a hardened twelve year-old prostitute. There is a gory bloodbath at the end. By today's standards, Taxi Driver is not very shocking; there is so much sex, gore, violence, and shooting in movies today that people are used to it. Nevertheless, Taxi Driver was a groundbreaking film.  Many movies after it have used its themes and style.

In 1976, New York City had a parade of prostitutes, pimps, and porno theaters.  Twenty-seven year-old Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) gets a job driving a cab, primarily because he can't sleep.  He is willing to drive ""anyplace, anytime.""  The former Marine and Vietnam Veteran is a loner, interacting awkwardly with the other cabbies and with Betsy, a girl he falls in love with (Cybil Shepherd).  Betsy is a campaign worker for Senator Palantine, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president.

DeNiro strides into the campaign headquarters and charms her into a date for coffee.  He then takes her to A PORNO THEATER, innocently thinking that because he has seen couples there, that this is an appropriate place for a date.  Betsy storms off.  DeNiro's confusion at her anger is a clear sign that he is mentally unstable.

Betsy refuses to see him anymore.  This is the catalyst that sends Travis over the edge.  He purchases every piece in a ""traveling salesman's"" arsenal, and pumps his thin body up.  He is planning something big.  To the viewer's horror, you realize he wants to assassinate Palantine to get back at Betsy, even though Palantine rode in his cab and DeNiro even has his posters in his apartment.

DeNiro then meets twelve year-old prostitute Iris (Foster).  he wants to save her from her pimp, Sport, played by Harvey Keitel, and her life as a prostitute.  Keitel looks and acts so much like Kevin Spacey does now, you have to see it!  It is unreal.

Having said that it is also a fantastic movie for the thinking person. I love the soundtrack and the entire mood of the movie. It is very moody.

De Niro seems to be fairly sane at the beginning of this movie, but slowly (and I do mean slowly) his sanity gives way. Apparently he cannot stand the lack of morality and sleaze that he incounters every night, and eventually he snaps.

13506,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver, 1976, is one of the gems of American Film's second Golden Age.  Most of the directors that went modern after the flamboyant 60's, finally, took what they liked in European cinema and melded it to Yankee concerns.

Those concerns have to do with the aftermath of a bitterly divisive war.  Vietnam vet, Robert De Niro in an unbelievable portrayal, plays the mentally ill insomniac that stalks, a presidential campaign worker, Cybill Shephard.  De Niro doesn't seem to have social graces because on their first and only date, he takes her to a porn movie.  Then he stalks her and transfers anger towards the candidate.  He buys lots of guns.  Then we have 12 year old, prostitute, Jodie Foster taking Cybill's place as a reason-to-save society.

The score is a death dirge while De Niro drives the filthy 1970's streets of New York in his cab.  He has to wipe the back seat after each night's fares. The final Agamemnon scene with the pimps is unbelievably realistic, yet, when it is over, the audience is both repelled and elated.  One of the most interesting shots of mayhem I have ever seen.  I think its better than the end of The Wild Bunch.  I think today it is still the most gripping action scenes and set shots.

You then see Travis's face and you can almost see the tears and despair in his face. He sees eveyone on the T.V. with someone, with some form of companionship, whether it be just for TV or real. When they show Travis's face, you can tell he realizes he'll never have that.

13508,5,0767830555,"This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen. It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-eight years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.

Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role. He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.

On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.

Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.",1097452800,8,2693,5.02013422818792
13509,5,0767830555,"A film like ""Taxi Driver"" could not be made today.  Even in it's day it was highly misunderstood even among it's admirers as an exploitation film.  The first time I saw this film was on a double-bill in 1982 with a repugnant slasher film, ""Maniac"".  It's reputation probably wasn't helped because it was the impetus for an assassination attempt on the President.  The seventies saw a lot of daring films greenlighted but even by these permissive standards ""Taxi Driver"" must have been a tough sell.  The story centers on the paranoia of a lonely, disengaged taxi driver,Travis Bickle, played by Robert DeNiro who is disgusted with the vice of his chosen city, New York.  He may be more dangerous than the vermin he dispises.  When his feeble attempts to connect with other people are rebuffed he falls back on the only way he knows, violence.  He also elevates himself in his mind as some kind of avenging angel.  He takes it upon himself to be the protector of a 13 year-old prostitute, whether she wants to be saved or not.  It goes without saying that DeNiro gives a commanding and daring performance here.  It was his first starring role in a major film and he makes an impression.  He is ably supported by a supporting cast that includes Harvey Keitel as a pimp, Cybil Shepherd as a pretty campaign worker who rebuffs Travis after he takes her to a porn film, and a young Jodie Foster as the prostitute.  Director Martin Scorsese does a superior job from an excellent script from Paul Schrader.  This was Schrader's first script that was produced and he has never surpassed ""Taxi Driver"" with any subsequent screenplays.  The cinematography by Michael Chapman is excellent, a kind of hazy picture of vice-ridden New York before it was cleaned up.  Enough cannot be said about the jazzy score by Bernard Herrmann that heightens whatever mood is being conveyed.  This DVD contains an excellent documentary, but no commentary by Scorsese.  On a final note, is the last scene reality or a dream?

I'm a movie buff myself, and I have never seen such amazing acting. It's a crime he didn't win the oscar. Secondly, it's directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the more brilliant filmmakers of our time, and written by Paul Schrader. This is the team that brought you Raging Bull. When these two geniuses get together, they make pure movie magic. And finally, Jodie Foster. She's only fourteen years old, and beautifully brings to life the child prostitute who is secretly hating the horrible city she lives in. One of the most brilliant touches of filmmaking was made here when Scorsese portrays NYC as hell, such as focusing on the smoke spewing out of the sewers, and making Betsy, Travis Bickle's love, seem like an angel among all the demons.
  The story goes something like this: Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) Is a taxi driver who can't seem to sleep. He works at night, and the city around him fills him with paranoia, for the gangsters and the slime on the streets at night every day seem to be everywhere. Among all of these demons and devils, Travis sees an angel, a gorgeous woman named Betsy. He immediately falls in love with her, but his anti-social tendencies scare her off when he brings her to a pornographic movie on their second date, thinking it was just like all of the other movies. When she leaves him and won't return any of his phone calls, his depression rises until he meets a child prostitue named Iris (Jodie Foster) and her pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel). Feeling the deepest sympathy for her, he tries to help her leave that terrible lifestyle, not believing her pleas that she loves her being a prostitute and loves her pimp.

13513,5,0767830555,"After watching the classic 1976 film ""Taxi Driver,"" viewers may be interested in their reaction. It can be depressing. Martin Scorsese directed this open-sore of a film and of his many classic works, this is the one most obsessively analyzed. ""Taxi Driver"" is such a raw, visceral experience that after viewing its nightmarish terrain one must decompress.
Seedy does not begin to describe the horror of ""Taxi Driver,"" which details a world of pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts and a loner psycho brilliantly portrayed by Robert De Niro. This film established some of the great talents in motion picture history including De Niro, Scorsese, Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster. I wonder about disturbing epics like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Natural Born Killers."" Whenever I visit the video store, I notice these films are usually checked out, empty boxes leaning against the shelf. Who's watching these films, and why so often? The films share a common thread in that they have likable actors (De Niro, Malcolm McDowell, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson) playing despicable men prone to violent rages. Alienated one and all, these characters have become anti-heroes for a world severely lacking in heroes. There are so many ways to view this film, with multiple levels serving as proof to its complicated brilliance. Urban alienation, cultural emptiness, veiled racism, Watergate analogy and Oswald repression are just a few of the metaphorical doors one can open in this nightmare.
De Niro's Bickle is a Vietnam veteran suffering from insomnia. He takes a job as a cab driver to work nights, driving through the most dangerous New York neighborhoods for fares. He becomes infatuated with a beautiful woman (Cybill Shepherd) who works at the campaign office of Palantine. Bickle takes the woman to a porno theater on their first date, and she dumps him immediately. To no one's surprise, Bickle soon begins to stalk her. He purchases a deadly arsenal of hand guns and intensely works out in preparation for his assassination of Palantine (and most likely the woman too). Along the way, Bickle stumbles across a 12-year old prostitute (Foster) whom he befriends. His attempted assassination fails and he walks over to the prostitute's home and kills her pimp (Harvey Keitel), landlord and an unlucky gangster. ""Taxi Driver"" unbelievably ends with the prostitute having been returned to her parents and Bickle becoming an inner-city folk hero. Shepherd's character tries to make a date with Bickle, but he's now at peace with the inferno around him and drives on disinterested.
This ending has been debated for years. It is so controversial that when the film first ran on television, stations posted warnings stating they did not consider Bickle a hero. They're right. Bickle's a whacked-out cultural icon, granted, but he's no hero. He wants to be a hero, and perhaps the final scene is Bickle at the moment of death dreaming of a happy ending. He's essentially saved the day and rescued a damsel in distress. Bickle was seriously wounded after the shootout, having been shot in the neck. So it could have been a dream sequence, though Scorsese purposefully made it too vague to be entirely sure.
It's clear Bickle wishes to be a cowboy hero in ""Taxi Driver,"" as seen by the boots he wears and the guns he straps on like an inner-city John Wayne. His famously improvised ""You talkin' to me?"" speech is in fact a line of dialog lifted from the classic 1953 western ""Shane."" And the final showdown has Bickle taking on three men (outnumbered a la Cooper in ""High Noon"") in a bloody, ferocious battle that to this day is one of the most violent scenes in history. Bickle, adorned in Mohawk and Army jacket, fires at random. The violence is so sloppy one gets the feeling they are viewing an actual crime scene. There is no music, only the jagged noises of constant screaming and guns blasting within closed-in spaces. While we love the balletic violence of the final shootout in ""The Wild Bunch,"" we turn away from the gore in ""Taxi Driver."" It's as repellant as reality.
Scorsese's masterpiece is not intended for the young or emotionally disturbed. Bickle is not a hero in a film populated by an army of non-heroes. Still, viewers just might get confused. I know Bickle is crazy, but I feel sorry for him. At times, I even identify with him. And that can be depressing.",1089676800,6,4390,4.933783783783784
13514,5,0767830555,"In 1976, Martin Scorsese directed ""Taxi Driver"", starring Robert DeNiro. Calling this a ""conservative"" movie is a stretch, but it is a prescient look at New York attitudes that preceded the age of Giuliani. Paul Schrader wrote it. His story is a hoot in and of itself. He and his brother were raised in a strict Calvinist Pennsylvania family, emphasizing the strictest tenets of Scripture and absolutism. The Calvinists are big on pre-ordained destiny. Released from this environment, he came to Hollywood and tried everything. Naturally, he was a mess; a drug addict, an alcoholic and a heterosexual so confused he tried homosexuality just...to try it. Given the assignment to write a screenplay, he was holed up in a downtown L.A. hotel for weeks, then months. He had little social contact except occasional taxi rides to restaurants in and around L.A.'s skid row. He began to see the world from inside the taxi, and came up with a character and a plot revolving around the concept.
DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in ""Death Wish"" (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.
The message of ""Taxi Driver"" is that peace comes from strength. It was a popular theme in a number of flicks. Hollywood seemed to fail to grasp some important realities about its marketplace. Time after time, movies that veered away from ""touchy feely"" liberalism and gave teeth to conservative characters (Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"", Bronson, DeNiro, and others) made boffo box office, yet the industry has never come to grips with itself. They return time after time to premises that insult conservative audiences, and wonder why the lines get shorter.

13515,5,0767830555,Every film class should have TAXI DRIVER on it's agenda:  This is an exercise in cinematic symbolism.  The steam rising from the manhole covers suggesting NYC houses the gates of Hell;  The .44 Magnum;  The long apartment hallway shot with Travis on the telephone to Betsy (being rejected);  The rally at Columbus Circle...it goes endlessly.  This tale of urban angst and desperation is an all time classic.  The Bernard Hermann score (his last) stands on its own pillar of greatness.  One of Scorsese and DeNiro's best works and without question the best film from 1976.,1086220800,3,571,4.936842105263158
13516,5,0767830555,"A good deal of the controversy about ""Taxi Driver"" revolves around its ending, and justifiably so.  There are basically two criticisms that are particularly valid:  The first revolves around the violence in the picture.  Even by today's much too jaded standards, Travis Bickel's rampage is quite shocking.  The question is: Was that extreme violence absolutely necessary to show the viewer? In other words, there is a sense that the viewer is being merely titillated by violence. Is it just violence for violence sake with no redeeming characteristic? Or isn't that Martin Scorsese's point?  Isn't the violence pointless and irrational because Travis Bickle's life is pointless and he is himself an irrational person?
The second point of criticism is of course why the film ends as it does.  Should it have ended with the exterior scene of police cars with their flashing lights and the assembled crowd of onlookers?  Or is the extending ending just right?  Did the post-rampage scenes really happen (in the story)?  Or are they a halucination that Bickle is experiencing as he is dying from his gunshot wounds?  Does it really matter anyway?
My own position is that, within the context of the story,  it really doesn't matter whether Bickle is dreaming those ""events"" or not because Paul Schrader (the screenwriter) wrote the story that way to, among other things, highlight the nature of fame and celebrity.  Aside from the fact that as viewers we know that Bickle is really no hero and therefore doesn't deserve to be treated as one, we recognize the absurdity of the press and its hunger for ""red meat"" stories and images. As the famous definition of celebrity goes: a celebrity is someone who is famous for being famous. If the film had ended suddenly with the exterior post-rampage street scene, Schrader would not have been able to make this additional point.  Scorsese's directorial talents are therefore beyond criticism.  In any event, Scorsese and Schrader worked closely on this film and I don't see the point in second guessing them. They are both men of considerable talent and their judgement has to respected. They knew what they were doing.
Besides, if someone wants to know what the film would be like without the post-rampage scenes all they have to do is stop the VHS/DVD player. By the way, the film that was used for Bickle's rampage scene was not chosen as ""grainy.""  The correct term is that the colors were desaturated.  It was done to avoid the possibility of garnering an ""X"" rating which would have severely limited the film's audience at the time.  (Even today an ""NC-17"" rating is the kiss of death for a movie). Sadly, when a search for the original film stock with fully saturated colors was made many years later, it was found to have deteriorated beyond the point of recovery.  What a shame! It would have made for an interesting restored version.
In any event, there is no need for me to recommend this film.  It recommends itself.",1085961600,4,2966,4.872509960159363
13517,4,0767830555,"Director:  Martin Scorsese
Cast:  Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle.
Running Time:  120 minutes.
Rated R for a scene of extreme violence and language.
All of us have known, in some shape or form, how Travis Bickle (played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro) feels.  There is a time in every person's life in which he/she feels isolated from the world, perhaps out of place or unjustly a receiver of misfortune.  Travis, on the other hand, is consumed by this sense of loneliness and despair, taking it to the brink of pure destruction and maniacal proportions.
DeNiro is hauntingly right on as the former Vietnam veteran who decides to get a job as a taxi driver for the streets of New York City.  As he cruises the big-city landscape, he realizes all of the hidious crime, starvation, murder, death, and macabre that consumes society.  When he is rejected by a love interest (Shepherd) due to his out-of-the-norm behavior, Travis begins a downward spiral:  he begins to train as if he were still in the military, buys numerous firearms and weapons, and ultimately plans to stage an assasination attempt on one of the political candidates planning to take over the city.
When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  ""Taxi Driver"" is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.
Director Scorsese uses dark camera angles and vivid images to portray his story, incorporating a musical score that embodies the essence of the film: an unoffensive saxaphone that dwindles into a deep, resounding boom.  A film that can shock and chill, one that should be celebrated for its original genius, but also a work that is almost too graphic and emotionally-draining to enjoy.",1085270400,4,2267,4.984084880636605
13518,5,0767830555,"To be frank, although I enjoyed Scorcese's Mean Stretts, the film did not leave a lasting impression on me.  This does not mean that the acting was poor, rather the script was somewhat simple and unpolished.  Scorcese took a lot more time on Taxi Driver, and this is apparent throughout the entire film.  To begin with, the music score by Herrmann compliments the tone of the movie perfectly and conveys a feeling of loneliness and drifting.  Secondly, the strength of DeNiro and Keitel's acting has improved considerably.
  I don't want to give an explanation of what happens in the movie, rather to present an inidividual understanding.  Many have dismissed Taxi Driver as a film which goes nowhere, and have called it too artsy.  My interpretation differs.  Certainly, it is not a unique film, but the feelings of loneliness and social awareness that DeNiro brings to his role are interesting.  DeNiro may be thought of as a modern day Steppenwolf-a man completely alienated from his surroundings.  Note, for example, the scene where he sits in the cafe with his collegues.  His inability to communicate at even the most superficial level demonstrates his alienation from his surroundings, but also arouses the sympathy of the viewers.
  Taxi Driver is unique in that the Scorsese did not hesitate to include racism in the movie(recall the scene when Bickle leaves the cafe and throws some menacing looks at a black man passing by).  To see a film that is not concerned about making people happy and being politically correct is refreshing.  Also the portrayal of the corrupt and superflous candidate is amusing.
  Essentially, Taxi Driver is one of the most slept on films of the 1970's.  Although it made a big impact at the time of its release, the touchy subject matter made it difficult for TV stations to air it to a home audience.",1084233600,,1840,4.877419354838709
13519,5,0767830555,"As I watched Taxi Driver for the first time in twenty-odd years, I was reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable.  Not because Unbreakable comes anywhere close to Taxi Driver in terms of cinematic merit, but because Taxi Driver seemed to be aiming at the same broad theme--a comic book-style hero in a gritty, adult world. Because, if anything, Travis Bickle seems to fit quite closely a real world Batman, enraged by the injustices of the world, unable to fit in, and ultimately taking the law into his own hands.  He has a raw honesty--in sizing up people, in not being offended by a porn movie--and an uncontrollable urge to act on a primal sense of right and wrong.
Clearly, Travis is also more complex--and more disturbed--than the average comic book hero.  After all, Scorcese is aiming for real life (as to which Unbreakable is a pale, upper-middle-class imitation), and Travis' own, flat reaction to his apparent ""psychosis"" (his lamentations about having ""these thoughts"" was particularly impressive) betray a condition that at least fits our preconceived notions of what it means to be mentally ""ill.""  But, unlike so many ""sane"" people, Travis does the unthinkable--he speaks to people honestly and openly, he gets enraged by injustice and immorality (no one else in the movie seems to care very much about 12 year old prostitutes), he has a nobility about himself (not giving in to sexual temptation from Jodie Foster's character).  And his apparent planning to attack a presidential candidate (the movie is never really clear as to whether he intends to harm the man, or even scare him) seems driven by the falsity of the candidate's message--his ""we are the people"" mantra echoing in a world where the common people (at least those encountered by Travis) are the last ones you'd want running things.
The ending is fascinating.  Is it real or a fantasy?  The clippings of newspaper articles, as the camera scans across the board, say Travis is dead, and then later that he is comatose, but recovering.  I suspect that the ending is a dream, the hallucination of a dying man who has his nobility vindicated in the end by appreciative parents and a city that needs more men like him.",1083628800,5,2197,4.887096774193548
13520,4,0767830555,"If there is one film that defines ""timeless classic"" my pic would be Scorsese's Taxi Driver. DeNiro not only gavethe best performace of the year (1976), arguably the best performance in all of cinema. This film introduced Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino) and one of the best actors the world will ever see, Robert DeNiro. The only reason this DVD does not achive the 5-star rating is because of the extras. Very good in their own right, but this movie deserved better. Much better.
Recomendation - Buy it, and praise it.",1082332800,2,524,4.833333333333333
13521,5,0767830555,"I don't understand why Bickle is considered a villian, let alone one of the greatest villians of all time (according to some big list by Time Magazine or something). If anything, he's a hero!! Sure, he wanted to assassinate the governor, and yeah, he probably is a racist, but he killed three bad suckas in order to save a 12 year old girl. That's gotta count for something.
Anyway, this movie is perfect. It's like Lost In Translation but with a revenge-seeking lonely psycho in the lead. I love the camera work of scorsese. simply amazing.
the nearly one and a half hour documentary is very cool as well. nice commentaries from peter boyle, jodie foster and some guys who worked on the movie.",1082160000,,694,4.604838709677419
13522,5,0767830555,"You already know that this is a classic film.  What makes the DVD worth owning is the fascinating making-of documentary that accompanies it.
Schraeder, Scorcese, De Niro, Foster, Brooks, and Keitel all share their memories of the film's inception, production, and reception upon release.  Their insights and recollections are actually worth hearing, and the documentary as a whole makes you wonder why most other DVDs have such useless extras.",1081123200,,443,5.405797101449275
13523,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is set in New York, and focuses on a loner cab driver named Travis Brickle ( Robert De Niro). Travis is a somewhat mentally unstable Vietnam vet, who is sickened by the sleaze and violence that he sees at night on the streets of New York. One night, Travis has an encounter with a young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) and becomes determined to persuade her to leave her pimp (Harvey Kietel). As Travis slowly decends into depression, paranoia, and overall madness, he becomes determined to rid the streets of crime himself.
Taxi Driver is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. The reason the story is so great, is because it involves a taxi driver whose only human contact is the fares that he takes, which forces him to concentrate on the worst that society has to offer. This is what makes Travis feel like he is the only solution to society's problems. The film slowly takes you through each step of Travis's decent into madness. Travis Brickle is Robert De Niro's best performance in my opinion. DeNiro's ability to slowly break down the character is amazing, and watching De Niro transform himself into a crazy vigilante will give you the creeps. This includes the classic scene with De Niro standing in front of the mirror saying ""You talkin to me?!!"". Jodi Foster, Harvey Kietel, Peter Boyle, and the rest of the cast were all great in their roles as well.
Overall, Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films. The film effectively showcases the scum of society and the creation of a crazy vigilante, and Robert De Niro gives the best performance of his career. The DVD features an oustanding making of featurette featuring Robert De Niro, Jodi Foster, and director Martin Scorsese.

13524,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"", directed by Martin Scorcese, is a great psychotic and dark film about a man, Travis, who suffers from insomnia and begins his job as a taxi driver.  As he begins developing more psychotic thoughts, the plot becomes more interesting.  The several twists and turns keep audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  The grizzly streets of New York City offer a closer, more interesting look into every event.  Such dark theme makes this film ahead of its time; in fact, some may say it's also ahead of our time.  The multiple storylines keep the plot interesting the whole time, namely a woman, Betsy, he's obsessed with and a twelve-year-old prostitute, Iris (nickname ""Easy""), that he wants to help.  This leads to a powerful conclusion.  The presented quality deserved its four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture of 1976.
The actors add their own powerful psychotic theme to ""Taxi Driver"".  Robert De Niro plays Travis delightfully.  His every expression is flawless.  Jodie Foster plays Iris beautifully as her character's pain and yearning are expressed to the fullest.  She proves that she was one of the best child actors from the 1970's.  This role is great for audiences to watch to see how she's become the genius actress she is.  All other actors also performed their roles wonderfull, namely Cybill Shephard, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle.
""Taxi Driver"" is a great film for audiences looking for a unique drama.  Its dark theme will never be forgotten by any viewer.  This will surely continue to be a classic for many more years.",1078876800,,1562,4.953846153846154

13529,5,0767830555,"Directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest films of the 20th Century. The story about a man drowning in loneliness that desperately seeks the approval of the social lives of those around him. He is Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), who (as the film opens) gets a job as a cabbie because of the insomnia he suffers of. He prefers working nights (12 hour shifts), will take anyone anywhere, and still he can't seem to sleep. His point-of-view is an ingenius cinematic approach whereas it is viewed in slow-motion (which symbolizes his heightened observation). There are so many undercurrents within the film that even Bickle himself doesn't realize. There is an apparent prejudice against african-americans (the usual stereotype of them all being pimps or drug dealers - and ironically enough when Bickle finally does meet a pimp, he turns out to be white).
Bickle bides his time in a coffee shop where all the 'night shift' cabbies hang out. He listens to them ramble about imaginary women who give them $500 tips and their phone number to somewhere in South America. His attention wanders and his inability to socialize presents an awkward air that is at times difficult to watch.
Bickle eventually meets Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) who is an avid supporter of the presidential candidate Palantine. His former view of the inhabitants of New York as ""scum"" is finally changed when he meets a girl who ""is not like the rest of them"". He asks her out to a movie and it turns out to be porn. He knew it was porn (he goes to the same theatre every night he's off work), but he doesn't go for the usual reason people go, he gets no satisfaction out of it, it is as if he's punishing himself for having walked into such a place. He seems to not realize why she looks at him with disgust and eventually leaves and never wants to see him again.
Bickle is a ""walking contradiction"" whereas he sees the world as evil and wrong, but in his attempts at being accepted, he finds himself bending the rules of morality and becoming what he despises.
He comes across a 12-year old prostitute named, Iris (Jodie Foster), who he immediately likes, but the only way he can be near her is to pay for ""half an hour"". He does so, and despite her attempts to ""make it"", he tries to tell her that he's come to set her free from the life of prostitution. ""Don't you want to get out of here?"" he asks. ""But it saves me from myself,"" she answers innocently. He leaves frustrated.
Bickle is (like the John Wayne character in ""The Searchers"") trying to rescue women who don't want to be rescued. It becomes his obsession that these women are being oppressed and that his goal in life is to set them free.
His obsession leads to violence when he purchases weapons and attempts to assassinate Palantine, but runs away almost as if, at the last moment, coming to his senses. But that is only the ""dress rehearsel"" for the climax of the film which is one of the most graphic scenes of violence ever filmed. It is shot in 'washed out' colors as if the ensuing violence has drained the blood from the film.
The famous line, ""Are you talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here,"" spoken to himself in a mirror, has been many times mimiced but the meaning can only be fully realized in this film. It is the voice of a lonely man amidst the crowd, a voice of sarcasm at his own worthless condition. The condition we all find ourselves in from time to time.
The film ends with Bickle meeting Betsy one more time as he is driving her home in his cab (by a chance meeting). Her look has changed from one of disgust to admiration and the viewer senses that this scene is not real. That it is either his final dying thoughts or simply a fantasy in his mind. It is Bickle finally finding redemption, finally finding his place in society. It has all been resolved and now he can lead a normal life or die happily.",1077494400,91,3863,4.473087818696884

""Taxi Driver"" has proved to be one of my favorite films and relates to other figures in Hollywood and literature. ""Taxi Driver"" relates to James Dean (from ""East of Eden,"" ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" and ""Giant""), and Holden Caulfield (the alienated hero from J.D. Salingers ""The Catcher in the Rye."" All three figures, wheather real or unreal, film or literature, are equally alienated from society, live/has lived in New York, not to mention that they all suffer(ed) from insomnia.
In ""The Catcher in the Rye"" Holden gets tough in front of the mirror (never says any dialogeue while getting ""tough""), in ""Taxi Driver,"" Travis Bickle gets tough in the mirror (this time with dialogue.
Holden calls a majore portain of society ""phonies,"" while Travis Bickle calls a majore portain of society ""scums.""
Holden talks about how he hates the movies, yet he see's a lot of movies. Travis talks about how he despizes the sex on the streets yet watches XXX rated movies.
Holden talks to his sister in the novel that if he were to be anything, he would be a catcher in the rye, someone who saves kids from falling out of the Field of Rye, in other words: saving kids from growing up, stop litte boys from becoming violent and most recognizalby for girls to remain virgins, in ""Taxi Driver,"" Travis Bickles worries of a teenage prostitute get the best of him and he wants to save her.
Mysteries:
Travis is not really that specific about his past, all we know about him is how old he was (26), his clean driving record, and that he was once in the military, nothing more, we don't know where he grew up, of his parents (with the exception that they're wedding anniversary and ""mother's"" birthday is in July). In one of the essays on ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" Holden is reffered to as a ""rebel without a past,"" this seems to be the case with Travis Bickle.
When Travis meets Betsy, we are never really know how she really feels about Travis. It's not until the third or fourth viewing that you can tell by the way Betsy talks to Travis that she's not really sincere with him. In fact she may have even ben playing with him. Others might argue with that, which is why Betsys true feelings for Travis are a mystery.
Also, the end of the film remains a mystery, we're not really sure about what happends to Travis after the shootout, others would easily say that Travis recoveres from a coma and slowley returnes to civilization, but we're not really sure of wheather what happends is the reality in the film or Travis's final thoughts as he slowely dies from his wounds after the shootout. Most would want to believe that the ending is the films reality, (including myself).
Wheather film fact or film fiction, relation or no relation, ""Taxi Driver"" to this day remains one of the most powerful films about alienation.

Travis knows he can make a difference. Travis will go out and do what nobody else will do. Travis will be the hero in the end... you'll see... oh yes you will...
*This is simply one of the all-time great classics about urban paranoia, isolation and redemption. De Niro practically holds the whole film on his own from start to finish.

The movie is just about him driving people around and hes stocking this girl by watching her constantly.  And then at the end he exercises and kills 4 guys.  Thats it.  I thought it was going to be like The Goodfellas or Casino.  Since it was made in the 70's, I will give it credit.  It is just a renter.",1073520000,3,450,4.034090909090909

This movie definetly deserves much more than 5 stars, but to each his own. I after watching this movie I said to myself wow! I did not think that someone could make such a dark movie. This was so great it shows you what goes on in the insane/criminal mind. But in the end is the most shocking he turns out to be a hero instead of a criminal. Travis goes nuts gets a bad hair cut and kills some gangsters. Then he turns out to be a hero. WHOA what a mind blow not what you would expect at all! Scorsese scores big with this movie! The acting by De Niro is also great! He really makes you belive that he is nuts! Looking for a movie to watch....rent Taxi Driver!",1073174400,,795,3.9440993788819876
13537,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is a lot like the John Wayne Western, ""The Searchers"".

Travis has 2 choices, Kill the Presidential Candidate or Save the Girl. His first choice is to Kill the Candidate... That says a lot about Travis.  For as much as we cheer when he blows them away, for Travis this was his 2nd choice.

Why does Travis want to kill Palantine? Is it because he wants revenge? He wants to Kill the thing Betsy loves most, which is her cause? Is it because Travis sees the phoniness of politicians is just as bad as the Pimps and Prostitutes on the streets. Is it because HE wants the fame?

It's probably a little bit of everything. ""Here is a man who could not take it anymore"". Travis rises up!

It is also interesting to note a chilling similarity to ""The Manchurian Candidate"" in Taxi Driver. Just as we see the Angela Landsbury is the controller of her own son as an assassin through brain washing, we are blinded to the fact that Janet Leigh is Frank Sinatra's operator, (Note the strange conversation in the train car, ""Would you like a cigarette?"").
Anyway, it always amazes me how many people have seen this movie countless times, but have never noticed that it's Palantine in the Taxi with the Hooker in the opening minutes. There is no question about it, Palantine IS trash. That explains a lot... but you just don't put it together if your not watchng closely enough.

I especially like the bit with the kids throwing cans and rocks at the taxi (Booing the heel for not saving Iris from Sport). Very cool, you just don't see craft like this anymore.",1073001600,4,1558,4.487632508833922
13538,3,0767830555,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem - and not just one. He's a seemingly ordinary New York cabbie who?s stalking one woman, Betsy (Cybil Shepard) while playing savior to another, Iris (Jodie Foster). But ol' Trav' is just a few coins short of a full meter, a neurotic oversight that will allow him to turn vigilante, threaten the political reelection campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and blow away Iris?s pimp/drug dealer (Harvey Keitel). Suffice it to say, ""Taxi Driver"" is not your feel good movie of the summer. It is a cinematic snapshot of 70s pop culture gone horribly awry, with its crack and whore infested streets, its unstable social setting for easy scores and cheap sex, and a seething underbelly of corruption and dismal isolation as its acrid palette for moral decay. Travis? slow spiral into becoming the loner with a purpose is predicated upon warping the old adage and precedent that one man can make a difference. But when that one man is touched by his own sexual and financial inadequacies, his psychotic inability to bond with another human being and his self delusion - that he is on par with a deity, above the rest of humanity and the law ? then the difference he can make is between destroying himself and bringing about the next apocalypse.
Martin Scorsese directs adeptly enough, drawing the viewer into this dark world of unsettling realities. The irony of the ending seems somewhat strained and rather a bit like the happy ending tack on associated with conventional Hollywood wisdom, but there is the frightening prospect that with a return to normalcy, Travis? alter ego is, like many a volcano, merely dormant, not dead, and destined to erupt in the future.

The transfer from Columbia is a rather disappointing remastering effort. There are moments when the color is bold, if dated, and moments when fine detail is generally realized to good effect. But the bulk of this video presentation is riddled with excessive grain ? both film and digital, a barrage of compression artifacts, a lot of aliasing, some tiling, and a considerable amount of edge enhancement. Night scenes break apart with pixelization and exhibit a very muddy color scheme. There's plenty of age related dirt and grit to further detract from your viewing experience. The audio has been remastered - but just barely - with low to no bass and a really screechy high end that betrays the original mono elements. Extras include a 70 minute making of documentary with interviews featuring the director and principle cast, a photo montage, still gallery, theatrical trailer and storyboard sequences.",1070755200,3,2630,4.9772727272727275
13539,4,0767830555,"Whoa!! Fireball performance by De Niro, competent direction by Martin Scorcese and good supporting performances by Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel - all the elements which worked together in bringing out this classic.
De Niro is the lonely guy who takes a one-way ticket to the loony bin when he is shunned by the world. The world around him is too busy to take notice of him and his loneliness turns into frustration, then into desperation and culminates in psychosis. He becomes in hell-bent in rescuing a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her way of life and shoots up some pimps and low-life along the way. That is Taxi Driver in a nutshell, but what makes this great is how all the actors literally live their roles and make us feel as if they are just on candid camera. You feel a bonding with De Niro since once in a lifetime, everyone goes thru this patch of neglected loneliness.

It's not even in the top 1,000. There was nothing about this film that should appeal to anyone looking for entertainment. The greatest emotion you'll realize while watching this film is shear boredom.
""Taxi Driver"" changes gears so many times you really don't know where this film is heading. It makes so little sense and De Niro's performance is so uneven, you don't know if he's doing it on purpose or he's just a bad actor.
A good date film? No, it will kill the mood. A comedy? You may laugh once but probably unintentionally. An adventure? Only if you consider watching the trials and tribulations of a wacked out taxi driver adventurous. This film is all over the place and it never lets you get a grip on what the director is trying to tell you. Oh sure, now, they tell you that it's a genius of a film but while you're watching it you'll swear that the writer and director were using illicit substances while making this nonsense.
Anyone that can't write a screenplay at least as good as this in one day, simply isn't trying very hard. This movie is a tragic waste of time and your wife or girlfriend will leave the room while you sit there hoping it's going to get better. Well, guess what. It won't get better and you shouldn't even spend one second giving any thought to renting or buying this over-hyped, over-acted lobotomy of a film.",1064102400,18,1522,4.4784172661870505
13543,5,0767830555,"I had heard of ""Taxi Driver"" when President Ronald Reagan had gotten shot and finally, one day, I saw what the fuss was about after viewing the movie. This is one amazing and disturbing movie, folks. ""Taxi Driver"" is the movie that John Hinckley, Jr was taken by, when he became obsessed with impressing Jodie Foster, prompting his assassination attempt. It can be quite disturbing for people sensitive to racial and sexual issues. The combination of graphic language and sexual themes makes this a movie that should not be on everyone's ""essential movie collection."" But for those who are fans of people like Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, director Martin Scorsese (tidbit about Scorsese below), and composer Bernard Hermann, it is worth every penny.
I cannot stress enough that ""Taxi Driver"" deserves every ounce of the ""R"" rating it got (strange that ""Midnight Cowboy"" had received an ""X"" rating less than a decade earlier -- only Scorsese's decision to desaturate (but not delete) the final blood- filled killing scene kept ""Taxi"" from the ""X"" rating). It's difficult to suggest just who would be interested in a movie that starts in such a dismal air and spirals into psychological depths  even further down as each scene rolls by. You may love it or despise it, but you'll be moved by ""Taxi Driver.""
No details about the plot from this reviewer; practically every review has enough about that. I wanted to focus on the brazen and unflinching dialog and plot to give the readers here a clear warning to brace yourselves for one of the most powerful dramas ever filmed. And make certain to activate the parental block on your DVD player if you purchase this when underage children are living at your residence.
""Taxi Driver"" has themes which include racism, sexism, violence, abuse, prostitution of children, and murder. In other words, Scorsese makes the viewer take a blinding, eye- opening view of a sample of the reality and brutality of life that some people live through, even now. If you're open- minded and sane enough to view such a movie, by all means, check ""Taxi Driver"" out. Just remember: It's only a movie.
If you choose to purchase, buy the collector's edition DVD (the one with the B&W half- face portrait of De Niro), which has plenty of extras that the original DVD lacks. It has a wealth of information on the movie's production, including how some of the players researched their characters. There are also interviews of the different actors, including De Niro, Foster, Peter Boyle and more. The disc also has production stills and commentary by the DVD's producer.
SCORSESE SIGHTINGS: Martin Scorsese can be seen in two different scenes in the movie. The first scene is the introduction of Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) as she reaches the door of the Palentine headquarters. Scorsese sits to the right on the steps. The second Scorsese sighting is when Travis Bickle (De Niro) picks up a fare and takes him to an apartment where the rider (Scorsese) spies on his wife.",1064102400,,2988,4.870333988212181

13551,5,0767830555,"Director Martin Scorcese and Robert De Niro (as Travis Bickle) collaborated on a film unlike almost any other I have seen. What to say about it? Bickle is a delusional and dysfunctional (probably deranged) taxi driver in Manhattan who is strongly attracted to Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful young woman centrally involved in the political campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris); Bickle also attempts to befriend Iris (Jodie Foster), a runaway teenage prostitute. He proclaims ""I'm God's lonely man!"" In some respects resembling the psychotic character Archer Maggott played by Telly Savalas in The Dirty Dozen, Bickle also sees himself as God's avenging angel whose mission in life is to eliminate all of the evil which he perceives in his world. After recently seeing this film again, I asked myself the same question I did in 1976: How many Travis Bickles are out there? All of the performances are outstanding. Working carefully with Paul Schrader's screenplay on which he presumably collaborated, Scorcese portrays a sordid, potentially violent underworld which is most dangerous after all the ""good people"" are comfortably settled and secure in their homes.

13553,5,0767830555,"Silence broods like a bevy of knives through one's subconscious.  Why do people literally hate being alone?  I believe the answer lies in our minds.  We, as human beings, are naturally afraid of being alone with our thoughts...our vivid imaginations.  Paul Schrader can certainly attest to that after writing Taxi Driver, and John Hinckley Jr. is living proof of the truth the film held.  Drew Barrymore could tell you first-hand how real the film was to her.  While our minds are capable of the most imaginative and beautiful dreams, the same mind may also yield horrific nightmares and destruction.
""This utter aloneness is at the center of Taxi Driver...perhaps it is why so many people connect with it even though Travis Bickle would seem to be the most alienating of movie heroes. We have all felt as alone as Travis. Most of us are just better at dealing with it (Ebert, Chicago Sun Times '96).""  Travis Bickle is the mind of Scorsese's recurring character study, and the first among the three characters that accompany the mind, body, and soul of the isolated human in Scorsese's films.  (The other 2 are Jake La Motta - the body and Rubert Pipkin - the soul)  He directs the film almost entirely through the corroded subjective eyes of Travis.  Therefore, we the audience are forced to see what he sees and feel how he feels, resulting in our inability to escape the escalating terror festering in his fragile, eggshell mind.
Countless examples throughout Taxi Driver display this bizarre and disturbing study of the mind.  The film begins with a smoke-filled street illuminating with red fiery lights as Bickle's taxi drives by like a hearse in a graveyard.  Even the schizophrenic soundtrack suggests an eerie partisanship with Bickle's clouded perspective, going back and forth between smooth jazz and a ferocious drum thrashes and orchestration.  All he sees on the streets are hoodlums, prostitutes, thieves, and degenerates.  As far as the audience knows, we're not in New York or some big city...we're in hell.  Perhaps we're in Bickle's own personal hell in his mind.
If you're interested in a film that studies humanity in its most vulnerable state, this film will live up to your expectations.  If you're interested in a film that critiques the 1970s and the obsession with celebrity, then this this film will give you what you want.
In addition, the Collector's Edition gives you plenty of special features, including the original script, documentaries, photo stills, and trailers.

13557,5,0767830555,"Robert De Niro's performance in TAXI DRIVER remains, after twenty-five years, one of the most powerful ever witnessed in an American film.  It is almost shocking today that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.  The reason isn't hard to locate.  Just as Shirley MacLaine lost in 1960 to Elizabeth Taylor when Academy voters thought the latter might be dying (obviously, she survived), so Robert De Niro lost in 1976 when Peter Finch, who had been nominated for NETWORK, actually died.  I liked Finch in NETWORK, but today his performance seems to pale beside that of De Niro's.  In addition to Henry Fonda's mythic performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, it is almost inconceivable that his performance was not acknowledged at the time.
De Niro is in very nearly every scene in this film, and without a stunning performance in that role, you do not get a stunning film.  Luckily, De Niro is unforgettable.  Although his famous scene in front of the mirror (the ""You talking to me"" scene, which was entirely improvised) is rightfully celebrated, in every second of the film his presence dominates.  I seem to remember reading years ago in an interview with screenwriter Paul Schrader that Travis Bickle was based very much on the narrator from Dostoevsky's NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND.  If he didn't say that, I will.  It isn't just that Travis seems socially out of place, but morally and metaphysically out of place.  He doesn't seem to be a person with a genuine core, and at the end of the film, he seems equally capable of good or evil.  He ends up doing good, but Scorsese has pointed to the arbitrariness of his actions.  He could easily have assassinated the political candidate instead of the pimp.  He ends the movie a hero, but an more an ironic hero than an anti-hero.  In a flip of a metaphysical coin, he accidentally ends up a good guy instead of a madman.
In a way, this film is a group effort, with tremendous performances by Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster, and a tremendous score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (CITIZEN KANE, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO).  But the main credit for this film should go jointly to De Niro, Scorsese, and Paul Schrader.  Unbelievably, neither Scorsese nor Schrader even received an Oscar nomination.  This, of course, says a lot more about the inherent conservatism of the Academy than about the job these men did.  In fact, most of the greatest directors to work in American cinema (Hitchcock, Ernst Lubitsch, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Orson Welles, among many others) never won a Best Director Oscar, and neither has Scorsese.  And very few better, more literate scripts have been produced in America.
I'm writing here on the assumption that anyone reading this has seen this film, probably more than once.  If that isn't the case, this truly is one of the greatest American films.  It is a landmark film, showing the ferocity and loneliness that many find in modern life in a way that has only rarely been portrayed in any art form, whether cinema or literature.

13561,5,0767830555,"The ending of Taxi Driver has generated a lot of controversy and confusion because most people tend to assume that it's a simple continuation of the narrative of the film.  In critical studies, however, the possibility is often raised that the end (after the  the shoot-out scene to the end of the movie) is no less than Bickle's dying delirious imagination.  I want to set forth the case that this is so.

First, at the end of the shoot-out scene, Bickle rolls his eyes backwards in the classic movie signature of death.  Just before, of course, he put his blood-dripping finger up to his temple and mimed blowing his own brains out (after having failed with the empty real guns).  Bickle is suicidal, dying, and will not recover.

Second, after this scene the camera pans across various news clippings on the wall of Bickle's room; these clippings describe him as a ""hero"" that saved a young girl.  Also we hear the voice-over of Iris' parents saying that Bickle would always be welcome in their home for saving Iris.  But think about real life crimes for a moment.  When newspapers report about a man that goes on a shooting spree in a run-down part of town, do they really ever report them as ""heroes""?  Even if Bickle could explain to them why he did this (Iris' dad says he was in a coma after the shoot-out), would anyone really take a person like this at their word?  And would Iris' parents really want to allow a murderous man a place at their table?  What we have here is Bickle's fantasy about how he _wants_ the press and Iris' folks to interpret his actions, not a realistic view of how the world generally views such actions.

Third (along the same lines as #2), it's hard to imagine Bickle's buddies at the cabstand glossing over his rampage and treating him like old times.  Really, if a co-worker of mine were involved in so violent an incident, I would probably not hang out with him so blithely.  This is Travis imaginging that things are ""back to normal"" after getting out of the hospital -- a fantasy of peace.

Fourth, Bickle happens to find Betsy in his cab soon after returning to work.  How fortuitous in a city of millions!  But their conversation shows that she now respects him, considers him a hero like the newspapers and Iris' parents.  Again, extremely unlikely -- especially given their history.  In real life if she heard about the rampage (or recognized him trying to kill Palentine), that would only tend to confirm her earlier opinion of him as a depraved person.  But here she also interprets his actions in the way he wants them to be interpreted (that he saved Iris from the human scum that were selling her) rather than how she probably would in real life.  (Also note that the photography of this scene always shows Betsy's face from his viewpoint, floating in a dreamlike way in his rear-view mirror.)

Fifth, when Bickle drops Betsy off she seems uncertain, embarrased, and demure, and is obviously just on the verge of offering some kind of intimate apology.  Instead she asks how much is the fare.  He drives off without accepting a dime.  This is Bickle's triumph -- he wins their relationship battle by rejecting _her_, and by being confident, independent, and morally superior.  Typical subconscious inversion tactic.

Sixth, as he drives off, Bickle sees himself in the car's rear-view mirror, then adjusts it to see if he can see Betsy.  As he does so, a violent wrench is given to the accompanying musical score.  Then we see no one in the mirror at all as the credits roll to Bernard Hermann's haunting love theme.  There's nothing in the mirror (except the rolling, ubiquitous city) because Travis is not there.  Its symbolic of his death -- like that of a vampire -- that the mirror doesn't show his reflection.  Travis is dead and we have just witnessed his last thoughts.

Travis is only a hero in his own mind.  There is no hero in this movie.  It does not have a happy ending.  Travis continues to justify his own behavior and viewpoint to the last, and grants himself a kind of sainthood -- beatified by the press, Iris' parents, and Betsy's acquiescence.

The tragedy of the movie is deepend by this reading of its end.  To my mind, this also makes the movie more coherent, since it's main theme is the psychological isolation of Travis Bickle.  The end consumates his separateness.  Others will never connect to his vision of himself as a master (rather than a victim) of circumstance, a protector of innocence, a scourge of evildoers, an instrument of God's judgement.",1047168000,294,4532,4.656171284634761
13562,5,0767830555,This movie is truely one of the greatest films of all time. Taxi Driver is surely De Niros greatest. Martin Scorsese is an absolute genious. I reccomend tis movie to everyone.,1046304000,,175,4.67741935483871
13563,5,0767830555,"Travis Bickle asks a girl out on a date, and takes her to a porno film. He sucks up to a political candidate, and ends up alarming him. He tries to make small talk with a Secret Service agent, but the agent is forced to back off. He wants to befriend a child prostitute, but scares her away.  Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is the story of a man who tries to connect but cannot.
Taxi Driver was Martin Scorsese's fourth film and I believe it to be his best, though I have an equal love for almost all of his films. He does a cameo in this and it is possibly the most memorable scene in the whole film. Paul Schrader, a great director in his own right, provides the script. Schrader started in film criticism, was fired, had no money and was forced to live on the streets. Taxi Driver is what came out of that. The score was Bernard Herman's last and it's a fine farewell to a great composer. Just like the cinematography, the music puts us inside Travis's head.
The film has a real dream-like quality to it and it's no doubt that that comes from its wonderful and obscure cinematography. There are shots in this film that are just astounding but there is one in particular I will never forget. Travis calls up Betsy asking for a second date and slowly the camera dollies over to the empty hallway and stays there for a minute but it feels like a lifetime. I always felt, and I hope this is right, that this symbolizes Travis's loneliness.
Robert De Niro gives one of the most chilling performances in film history and certainly, one of the best. Everything he does in the film is so right and I feel that it really wouldn't work if anyone else played Travis. Another Martin Scorsese regular, Harvey Keitel, turns in a surprisingly funny performance as a pimp called Sport. The scenes between these two legends are largely improvised and serve as some of the best scenes in the movie. A few of the other players are Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle and Cybil Shepard. All of these performances exceptional.
""You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here...""

13564,5,0767830555,"For me this movie is good, because it showed me that I am not allow. Yes, if you didn't live alone for yourself for a long time, don't reflect on how... well how frustrating life is, especially for young lonely man it is kind of hard to understand it. If you have family and friends you never get into that mood. But if you live all by yourself for weeks, months or years you may understand that. My feelings go upside down, sometimes I work very hard and have a ""normal"" life. The other day, I lay at home or walk or drive. But it is more than this ""feeling alone in a crowd""-stuff. Thoughts come to your mind about the world, life, whatever in a very unusual way. It is really difficult to expresse it.
Look at the docu about the movie, especially the parts where they talk abour DeNiros character and how they wrote the script.
Than you may get, what Taxidriver is really about, but you have to be a Taxidriver to know what it is to be one of use.
For the ""hero""-thing. HE IS NO HERO. Only public opinion in the movie make him that. The movie doesnt want to say he is a hero.
Then if you are like a Taxidriver you go with a girl to adult-movie without thinking, because you are still in your one world and stuff. You think, I must go out with her, but all what your mind comes up with is the adult-cinema because you go there all the time.
Well whatever, FOR ME IT IS A GREAT HELP to feel better and go get that I am not the one person God or however wanted to judge. I don't know what other people see it it...",1045440000,2,1514,4.066889632107023
13565,5,0767830555,"Robert De Niro is TRAVIS BICKLE, `God's lonely man', lost amid the indiscernible filth of New York City's street life with no place in the society he so detests.
When Travis becomes a taxi driver he feels the weight of the degradation that surrounds him and, alone with only his twisted ideals, he feels the intense need to prove his existence, becoming obsessed with saving a schoolgirl prostitute from her pimp. Travis gets organised and the film works toward the moment he has been heading for his entire life, culminating in a brutal and bloody extension of violence.
A devastating picture of one man's loneliness, Taxi Driver is an astounding movie, coming from the heart of a writer experiencing the intense loneliness that is transposed into the film's lead. In short this is my all time favorite film. Scorsese has never been better and this movie contains some fantastic examples of Scorsese's originality, namely the shot which leaves Travis alone on the phone to Betsy to stare down an empty corridor; it's too painful to watch him. The scene where Travis is rocking the TV with his foot is just sincere and brilliant film making.
Taxi Driver works because in this first Scorsese/ De Niro/ Schrader collaboration it seems all three managed to tune in to the same psyche, the same pathology that is examined through Travis. Schrader apparently wrote the script in one week with a gun on the table. I can see how some people don't like this movie and in terms of straight-forward non-demanding action I guess it could be seen as quite slow. But to be watched as a building and perfect portrayal of loneliness and alienation this movie is the greatest. It really annoys me to see DeNiro in some of the...films he does these days after seeing how incredible he can be on the screen. I think everyone should watch this movie and I think most people will really enjoy it.",1044316800,6,1876,4.740061162079511
13566,5,0767830555,"Few will disagree with me when I say that Scorsese's Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made. This one helped define the 70s and changed the face of American cinema. Scorsese's directing is brilliant. DeNiro has never been better, nor has Cybill Shepard (except in The Last Picture Show). This is one of Harvey Keitel's finest performances, and Jodi Foster has her best role here. The acting is superb. The cinematography was groundbreaking with the camera moves Scorsese made. Superb editing. And while Bernard Herrmann's score is dated (definitely from the 70s), it is a classic and fits this film in a way no other music ever could. Add that to the fact that Herrmann died just after finishing recording for this film. What a way to end your career. This film is superb in every way.
The dvd is a treasure as well. You get a making of documentary that lasts just over an hour, taking the place of a commentary track (and this is one of the few documentaries that can replace a commentary track). There are storyboards, the screenplay, filmographs, advertising materials, and a photo montage that is narrated and covers trivia that isn't discussed in the documentary. This is a fine edition.
This is the movie that brought Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese, Jodi Foster, and Paul Schrader to forefront of the American eye.",1044144000,,1332,4.7956521739130435
13567,5,0767830555,"This movie is an excellent expose on masculine loneliness (thus, the title of my review).  Scorsese, De Niro, and Paul Schrader all succesfully convey this emotion in this work; Scorsese through his ambient directing, De Niro through his dyspeptic portrayal of a man caught in an ocean of depression, and Schrader's well eluciated and eloquent script.  What becomes most apparent through extended viewings of this masterpiece, is that the same loneliness that pervades Travis Bickle's life also affects that aftforementioned trio: Scorsese, De Niro, and Schrader.  Through their knowledge and humanness in dealing with loneliness, they collaberated to construct a piece of art.  I, being a man that has known loneliness well, can relate whole-heartedly to this movie, and seeing it presented in the optimum by the construction of this DVD (with illumanting documentarires) makes me thankful.",1042675200,,891,5.481751824817518
13568,5,0767830555,"Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have concocted a perfect movie with ""Taxi Driver,"" which follows Robert deNiro's defining role of loner cabbie Travis Bickle.  The claustrophobic sets and tight cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's curiously tasty mix of polyphony and jazz in his final score, and the ever-present foley effect of an alarm clock ticking (connoting Bickle's state of mind of mental deterioration, a human time-bomb waiting to explode) all make for a highly personal character study of this self-described ""God's Lonely Man.""
What's more, Scorsese's triumph is getting the viewer to actually identify and sympathise with Travis, with his sense of isolation from society, with his obsession over Cybill Shepherd, his taking the young prositute, Iris (played with uncanny spunk by a young Jodie Foster) under his wing, and his unflagging mania for vengeance against ""the scum, the dogs, the filth.""  As he pads anonymously up and down Broadway, as he drives his taxi on rainswept streets in the wee hours of the morning, and as he sits alone in his apartment, pouring peach brandy over his Wheaties, we the viewers are along on his lonely ride and journey into fear.
Is Travis the hero, the antihero or the villain of this flick?  It really doesn't matter. Travis is a man compelled, his hand forced by the rot, corruption and indifferent hatred bred on the city streets.  The cesspool of crime is its logical consequence, just as much as is Travis, the loner turned lone gunman.  It is fitting that in his ""training"" scenes he is wearing cowboy boots, for he has a score to settle.  Not so much with Sport (played with abrasive wit by Harvey Keitel) and the pimps, johns and druggies that people this new urban frontier of lawlessness.  No, they are merely the tangible targets of his psychotic hate; The vengeance Travis metes out with his .44 Magnum is against a world that sees him as a virtual invisible man. Just as society turned their backs on the Vietnam vet, so does the woman of his dreams, Betsy (Shepherd).  Initially, Travis sees her as the last glimmer of hope for the redemption of a society gone to ruin.  But, when she rebuffs and deserts him over the clumsy social faux-pas of taking her to a porno movie on a first date, society loses all meaning to him, and he exacts his vengeance on society in order to transcend her rejection of him.  You can tell his fate is sealed when he sees his life ""pointed in one direction....there never has been any choice for me.""
The setting is modern, but what makes ""Taxi Driver"" into an eternal classic is its dark and tragic sense-of-life. Scorsese's movies would never be so darkly hopeless after this one; Even the gruesome ""Goodfellas"" had a much more lighthearted touch (if you can believe it).  This would also be Bernard Herrmann's last score.  In fact, he died just hours after recording the last bars of the score on a Hollywood sound stage.  It is a fitting swan-song for the movies' greatest composer, and a greater loss for Hollywood than they'll ever realise.
Darker than almost all films noir, think of ""Death Wish"" crossed with ""Othello"" when you think of ""Taxi Driver.""",1041811200,13,3174,4.844731977818854
13569,5,0767830555,"Watching Scorsese's unfailingly great ""Taxi Driver"" this weekend, I saw it as a haunting portrayal of a misled psychotic, who goes on a killing spree not to free the 12-year-old hooker from pimps but because he has his own misguided view of everything that's wrong with the world's morality.
That he's seen as a hero at the end of the film is a joke, a mistake made by people who think he did what he did to save Iris. Travis wasn't interested, I think, in saving Iris. He was just insane and didn't see Iris as one of the filth of humanity. He saw her as salvageable. He didn't go on the killing spree for her benefit, but her freedom was a lucky byproduct to Travis' madness.
This isn't ""Death Wish""-type vengeance. Travis is insane, a villain who doesn't understand the depths of his own madness. While dating political volunteer Betsy, he's so unclear on how to go about it that he takes her to a dirty movie, buys her an album she already owns, then stalks her. He writes a manifesto about the evils of society. He's a war veteran, living an isolated life away from his parents. He's unable to sleep. He sees the world as a sick place, where he's the only normal man left. He's not a hero. He's not a tough guy. He's a basket case.
Notice how little dialogue he actually has with Iris, played incredibly by Jodie Foster, before deciding to ""save"" her from Sport. Iris doesn't even want him to do it. Who she is doesn't matter to Travis. What she represents matters more to Travis. He's embarking on a rampage, intending to kill lots of people (including the presidential candidate in a thwarted attempt), yet he only succeeds in killing the pimps.
He's not a hero, but society, in one of the film's best twists, makes him a little girl's savior. Betsy, at the end, forgives him without knowing the extent of his madness, and he smiles at her.
Then, he keeps driving, thinking, plotting.

Robert De Niro (my hero of actors), in one of his early roles, plays Travis Bickle, the taxi driver who grows depressed with the world around him. He sees violence and evil in people, and when he sets out to save a young prostitute, he uses violence and takes the law into his own hands. The controversy at the end is whether or not he is a hero for saving the prostitue from her pimp, or if he's a bad man for using violence to solve the problem. Now, I liked this film. I was expecting a little more though. Some things really were misleading, kind of confusing, and at times, a little bit boring. The story was dark, and some scenes seemed to have no meaning to them. But, all in all the movie isn't that bad. I don't see why it is deemed a classic though. It's not all that great. I read another review that suggested seeing it more than once in order to understand it. Maybe that's what I need to do, watch the movie again and maybe I'll enjoy it more. I enjoyed the memorable scene in which Robert De Niro utters the ever popular quote ""Are you talkin' to me?"" and aims a gun at the mirror. I also think it's a cool part when De Niro puts his hand over a flame. I recommend this movie for those who are interested in the early days of De Niro's career, and for those who want to see a cynical portrayal of the world through the eyes of a demented man.",1039824000,6,1439,4.124555160142349

13587,5,0767830555,"The importance of Taxi Driver cannot be overstated. More than a well made film, the movie is a genuine character study of the highest achievement. The absurdity of the decade in which the film was made lends an incredible amount of reinforcement to the presentation. The ""conspicuous consumption"" lifestyle of the 1970's makes the cheapness of human life depicted in the film (prostitution, exploitation, violence) seem all the more engaging. A few of the more important, albeit subtle scenes that I feel make the character study so realized include the following (I would ask that any viewer of the film pay close attention to these scenes and try to interpret the subtle importance of them as they relate to the character):
- Travis is sitting in his apartment watching American Bandstand on TV. He is angered by the celebration of adolescent sexuality he sees and how ""human"" and accessible it is portrayed to be. In contrast, Travis is completely unable to conceptualize himself in this rite of passage, due to the self loathing image he has built up in his mind. Travis then sees an empty pair of shoes on the floor amidst the dancing couples, a stark metaphor for his inability to relate to the world he finds himself in.
- Travis, although seemingly articulate and confident about his emotional convictions in his journal entries, recognizes the impending disintegration of his mental state and decides to seek the advice of his colleague Wizard, in a last ditch effort to make sense of his feelings. Travis's somber desperation is evident in his discussion with Wizard and an attempt is made to address the situation. However, Wizard, who shares none of Travis's chronic isolationism, is unable to offer any helpful words to Travis, who is ultimately frustrated one last time in his final effort to salvage his sanity. In the closing shot of the scene, Travis tries to articulate his inexpressible frustrations, to which Wizard casually replies ""you know... you're all right, you're all right"". With his last attempt to make a human connection an utter failure, Travis is now locked into his path of destruction, a path that cannot be positively influenced by outside individuals due to his inability to express his feelings. It is a particularly chilling scene, perhaps the definitive example in the film depicting Travis's final fate.
- Travis is seen in his apartment room preparing for his confrontation with Senator Palentine. He speaks about his apocalyptic mission through his journal entries. However, his words portray a man unable to articulate himself even in his hour of destiny - ""listen you f***ers, you screw heads, here is a man who would not take it anymore, who would.. not....."" (starts over) ""listen you f***ers you screw heads....."". This scene is very effective in that it illustrates Travis's inability to express his emotions with certainty, even when they concern convictions which he feels strongly about.
- Immediately after his attempted assassination of Palentine fails, Travis is seen driving to the tenement house where Sport hustles. Dazed, Travis is utterly absorbed by his psychosis, his face a portrait of a concentrated, murderous obsession. A pedestrian attempts to flag down his cab, but Travis blows right by the would-be customer, occupied only with the slaughter he is about to engage in. I feel that this scene perfectly capsulizes Travis's complete descent into madness.
This film was cheated out of the best picture Oscar by Rocky, which (although a fine film in its own right) is a film that anybody can love. In contrast, Taxi Driver is a film that many people would prefer to avoid due to its cynical portrayal of human life.

13588,5,0767830555,"Do you remember the name John Hinckley? Hinckley was the guy who attempted to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. What does this have to do with ""Taxi Driver?""
The premise of this beloved film is, Travis Bickle, played by none other than ""Bobby D,"" attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate in an attempt to gain the attention of ""Betsy"" (Cybil Sheppard), who works for this candidate, who Travis also has the hots for. There's a line that Travis narrarates, ""I've got to do something big.""
While Jodie Foster, ""Iris,"" (the 13 year old prostitute), was in college (at Yale or Harvard, I forgot), John Hinckley was ""stalking"" her and writing her all sorts of disturbing letters. Eventually, as we all know, or forgot, or are now learning, he attempts to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. Hinckley apparenty does this in an attempt to gain Foster's attention, imitating the film. At the time of the attempt, he apparently was even dressed like ""Travis,"" in that he was also wearing the army field jacket. And in the pocket? A copy of ""Catcher in the Rye.""
The movie ""Taxi Driver"" went far beyond the cinema. Indirectly, this film has affected the federal firearm laws that are on the books today. For whatever disturbing reason, Hinckley in imitating this movie, thought that assassinating a president would gain him the attention of Jodie Foster. In his assassination attempt, he ended up shooting James Brady, who in turn had a hand in changing federal firearm laws, by implementing the ""Brady Bill.""

Scorsese and Paul Schrader(he wrote the screenplay) bring to life an unforgetable picture that should be recognized because to its universal themes and not because of the controversy surrounding it.
Robert De Niro gives a performance of the highest calibur. He plays the main character, Travis Bickle. Travis is a lonely and alienated man who's both fascinated and repelled by life in New York City. When he tries to fit in the norm, he finds himself posing as a threat to the 'normal' people. When he's rejected by a beautiful socialite, Betsy (Cybil Sheperd)as well as a twelve year old prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), he begins to go over the edge. Travis begins to become more earnest in making his presence known to everyone. He does so by taking extreme measures.
Travis Bickle is someone we can all relate to. We've all felt loneliness and detachment from our surroundings at one point or another. So it's easy to sympathize with him, but you can't forget what all he goes through in order to get that recognition he desperately wants. It's an intriguing and disturbing look at a man's tortured soul.
Scorsese has always done a wonderful job of getting into the minds and hearts of his central characters. His interest in learning what makes people tick is always evident.
I don't recommend this movie for the faint-hearted. It's not a movie for everyone. There are many things in this film that would prove to be too much for some viewers to take. However, it is a wonderful film despite that and it's important to be open-minded.",1025049600,,1685,4.7542662116040955
13605,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" is a classic, no matter what anyone says.  It's even considred one of the best 100 films of all time by the American Film Institute.  That alone says a lot, because a film donesn't reach that spot by accident.  This is a timely classic that continues to entertain people all around over and over again.
Directed by the great Martin Scorsese, this is the story about a man named, Travis Bickle.  He cannot sleep so he decides to be a taxi driver by night.  From his job he has seen the worst of the worst, and every day he seems to be losing his mind.  He turns psychotic every day and it only gets worse.  It eventually gets to the point where Travis wants to kill someone; anyone.  This is a terrifying glimpse into the darkest parts of city life that very few dare to explore.  This is the tale of one man who has had enough.
The movie is very well directed and written.  It is beautiful, dark, and haunting.  Disturbing as it may be, the story has such realism to it.  Robert De Niro outdoes himself in this film.  You can sense his drifting into madness so clear that it's scary.  They could have not achieved this goal if they had casted someone else for the role.
My favorite scene in the movie has to be when De Niro is talking to the secret service man.  It's so funny and yet so chilling at the same time.  And, of course, who can forget watching De Niro talking to himself in the mirror.  ""You talkin' to ME?""
This new DVD version is beautiful.  The picture quality is outstanding, considering how old this film is, and that I once had the older version that just came out when DVDs were only getting started.  Lots of special features on this disk.  If you have the older version of this movie and you love this picture, I urge you to go and get this newer version of the DVD.  It is ten times better.
This is a classic, and no one can ever take that away.  However, keep in mind that since this is a classic, it does not mean that you will like the movie.  I cannot tell you if you will like it or not, and neither can anybody else.  Just because ""Citizen Kane"" is a classic didn't change the fact that I didn't like that movie.  If you are currious to see it, then rent it and see if you enjoy it.  Even if it turns out that you don't like it, I clearly doubt that this will be the worst rental you will choose.  ""Taxi Driver"" is a magnificent work of art, and it is film-making like you have never seen.  A great movie that can never be duplicated.  A spectacular film.

It is one of those movies that I think has stood the test of time and is still a classic, and always will be a classic.  This is director Martin Scorcese at his best, and may be my favorite De Niro movie (or Godfather II).  ""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that shows how terrible society really is, and it probes into the mind of a person going crazy.  Robert De Niro does an awesome job as Travis Bickle, a lonely man who can't sleep at nights, thus becoming a cab driver.  He frequently visits porn theaters as well.  Driving around every night in his taxi, he sees that the scum of the earth comes out at night and walks the streets, in the form of criminals, pimps, hookers, etc.  He feels that the streets need to be washed clean of the dirt that contaminates them.  Amidst all the horror of society and the city, he meets a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepard), and is very much attracted to her.  He attempts to take her on a date, but not knowing much about movies, he takes her to a porn movie, and she rejects him.  After Betsy continually avoids him, Travis gets hurt by this.  Then he comes across a twelve-and-a-half year old prostitute named Iris, who he sees doesn't like what she does and wants to get out of it.  As all of this happens, Travis starts to get sick of the loneliness, and the rejection, and the trash that walks the streets, and he slowly goes crazy.  Then he gets a hold of some guns and a combat knife, and decides to ""clean the streets.""  The action sequence toward the end of the movie is very realistic and very graphic, and it is possibly the greatest and most intense shoot-out ever filmed.

13615,5,0767830555,"Man, the 70s were chock full o' excellent films.  From ""MASH"" to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Network,"" ""Nashville,"" ""Days of Heaven"" and especially ""Taxi Driver,"" the 1976 Martin Scorsese-directed grungy, street-level study of alienation.  Robert De Niro, memorable as the young Don Corleone in the second ""Godfather"" movie, brings us into the closing decades of the 20th century as Travis Bickle, the obscure and troubled cabbie.  This remains one of his signature portrayals.

Primarily a character study with only a bare-bones plot, ""Taxi Driver"" reveals Bickle, whose experiences in Vietnam have left him a shell, a soft-spoken insomniac with a never-ending monologue about the sordid things he encounters while prowling the mean streets of New York.  He drives his cab through rain-washed streets and kills time in porno theaters, cut off from the rest of humanity for reasons even he can't fully comprehend.  Eventually, he meets and attempts to woo two women who will change his life:  Jodie Foster as a teenaged prostitute, and Cybill Shepherd as a dedicated campaign worker.  Unfortunately, Bickle's inability to articulate his torment and his mental problems inevitably lead him down an increasingly shadowy path.

The film's climactic confrontation (between De Niro and Harvey Keitel as a pimp) scorches and burns but fails to provide a catharsis for De Niro's character (as it would in a lesser film), and its enigmatic ending remains much debated.  This is a dangerous film, seemingly as lethargic as Bickle's speech but, like the character himself, capable of erupting in violence.  John Hinkley would later use this film's political assassination plot as inspiration in his own pursuit of Jodie Foster; it's difficult to view the film without that association.  But this is a must-see, must-own film for serious buffs, DeNiro and/or Scorsese fans.

In this Taxi Driver special edition DVD, we have one of the best films of the 70's on a great disc with one of the best documentaries out there.  Travis Bickle, our antihero, is a cabbie who suffers from insomnia and wants to ""work long hours"". This is how he meets many of the strange characters he comes in contact with including Sport (a pimp played by Harvey Keitel) and a young prostitute named Iris played by Jodie Foster. Before that however, Travis becomes fixated by Betsy, who works in a campaign office. Travis, who is extremely lonely and shy, eventually works up the nerve to go into the office and tell Betsy that he'd like to volunteer. This is actually just a way for Travis to ask Betsy out on a date, which he does. However, that date turns out a disaster as Travis takes Betsy to a theater showing an X rated film and she is repelled by the entire experience. That causes her to avoid Travis and he eventually comes back to here office angry and looking for a confrontation. As to one viewer's criticism that this simply isn't believeable that he would take her to a porn film, I say to the contrary, he simply doesn't know any better. We're not dealing with a ladies' man here who knows what is and is not proper to do on dates.
It is after this that Travis begins to slip further and further into his depressed, isolated world and he eventually feels the need to take Iris under his wing and protect her (as he sees it) from Sport who he views as pure scum. The final act invloves a presidential assassination attempt and a famous violent scene involving Travis, Sport, Iris and several others (I'm trying not to get to involved in the third act here) that I won't go into.
More than anything, Taxi Driver is a character study of Travis Bickle and the isolation and loneliness that take their toll on him.  This is a different world that director Scorsese and writer Schrader invite you to experience, if not really enjoy. In addition, there is one of the best documentaries here that I've seen.

13624,4,0767830555,"Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is a most graphic and harrowing tale of loneliness and its effect on the human psyche.
Robert De Niro, the most versatile and talented actor ever in my opinion, plays Travis a man so plagued with insomnia he turns to taxi driving to while away the late hours.
In a job not usually associated with isolation, Travis, a misanthrope, feels a sense of solitude that is almost inexplicable. A man who finds it impossible to articulate his feelings, the slow degenerative process of rationalisation leads him to question his very being. With so much time to think, sickened at the state of New York City, Travis sees an opportunity to be someone - a self appointed bringer of justice.
This is not a pleasant film. In fact, it's the ugly tale of a man's sedulous quest for purpose culminating in extreme, explicit violence.
It's a frightening, grim and true-to-life film; an historic monument in cinematography, but those of a nervous disposition may prefer to give it a miss.

At the beginning of the film Travis is lonely, then when he meets Betsy (gorgeous young Cybil Shepherd) he feels that there is hope for him. One memorable quote is: ""I believe one should become like other people"". He's probably thinking that he can have a significant relationship with Betsy, marriage family perhaps. Unfortunately all that is destroyed when Travis takes Betsy to a porno movie on their first date. Travis is so socially clueless that he has no idea that this is offensive to a girl like Betsy. Afterwards he tries to make up with calls and flowers which are all ignored. That starts Travis' madness. At first his plan is to assasinate the political candidate that Betsy is working for, in an attempt to perhaps get back at Betsy. WIth that plan gone awry Travis turns to saving teen hooker Iris(Foster) from her pimps. A bloody gory battle that is an incredible climax. So potential policitical assasin Travis turns into heroic vigilante who frees teen victim.

13627,5,0767830555,"...Everywhere, in bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere, theres no ecscape, I'm God's lonely man.""---Travis Bickle
  ""Taxi Driver"" remains for me the best piece of work by Martin Scorsese. Stripped of the pretense of ""Raging Bull"" and the stylized atmosphere of ""GoodFellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" is a unashamedly honest look at New York city and its effects on a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran. Often uneasy to watch but amazingly and utterly compelling, ""Taxi Driver"" launched Martin Scorsese into the pantheon of great directors.
  Set in modern day (1976) New York, the story centres around Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a 26 year-old ex Vietnam veteran. He is shy, dispossesed and utterly alone. He frequents porn theatres, yet is repulsed by the 'filth' he sees on the streets. Unable to sleep at night, Travis becomes a taxi driver, working long shifts with little or no sleep. Through his nightly experiences as a cab driver, Travis becomes even more bitter and confused. Bernard Herrmann's impecible theme aurates Travis' battle between what he thinks he should stand against and what actually arouses him. In fact, the theme music is perhaps the second most important character in the film, acting as a metaphor for the daily downward spiral of Travis' mental state. In his solitude Travis lets the drudgery and depressive nature of his job burrow inside his mind. He falls for an angelic WASP named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and even manages to take her out on a date. But his complete lack of nuance for the real world ends up with any chance of a burgeoning romance left in tatters.
  What makes Travis' journey into madness even more compelling is the portrayl of the character by Robert De Niro. As the film progresses, De Niro's fractured performance is so real, you almost feel he really is Travis Bickle, even now some 25 years since the film's release. De Niro's best scenes are when he is trying to interact with 'normal' people, like his cab driver friends, or his confrontations with Tom (Albert Brooks) - a co-worker of Betsy. The way De Niro is one step removed from these and all the other characters in the movie is a feat he has not matched since. The script by Paul Schrader is also superb. The film shifts from centering on Travis' insecurity, to his misguidance and eventually to his role as a psychotic vigilante. The dialogue is superb and each character is shaped perfectly. The film also makes use of its many smaller, but no less important roles, such as Sport the Pimp (Harvey Keitel), Wizard the cabbie (Peter Boyle), Tom and Iris (Jodie Foster). All of these characters display an on screen presence that is rarely matched by other supporting cast members.

Holding it altogether is Scorsese. New York has never looked sleazier or grimier. ""Taxi Driver"" works because Scorsese never lets the film slip in any way. Movie buffs will recognise many small homages to different directors, but even the casual viewer will feel nailed to their seat as the walls within Travis' mind creep further and further in. A true feat of modern film making and a study in paranoia that may never be bettered, ""Taxi Driver"" is an important chapter in American film and one that requires repeat viewings despite its difficult and uneasy vibe. A modern classic without question.

13630,5,0767830555,"All the so called 'hype' this movie has generated is warranted and then some:nothing quite compares to it.  Something, to put it mildly, just went right.  The claustraphobic atmosphere of meaninglessness, alienation and pure depravity that Scorsese creates is nothing less than perfect. The all consuming glow of streetlamps, traffic signals and headlights allow us to see New York City as Travis sees it, a crowded hell where human being is separated from human being and 'survival of the fittest' is the brutal norm. De Niro's performance is beyond exceptional, it is transcendent.  He absolutely becomes Travis Bickle, a very lost and lonely young war veteran in a city full of people who seem to be asleep. For all intents and purposes, Robert De Niro no longer exists within the running time of this movie:indeed, he so good as Travis that he is sometimes much more frightening than the 'scum', like Harvey Keitel, that his character despises so much. If you've ever felt alone or marginalized in your life, this movie will immediately strike a deep chord with you.  I disagree, however, with interpreters who think that we are supposed to hate and revile Travis and see him as a sick, 'crazed loner' looking for any excuse to satiate his bloodthirsty rage. I would say that, on the contrary, Scorsese's timeless masterpiece is a work of the deepest empathy and compassion.  Travis Bickle is every man and woman who has felt abandoned and lost in a dark and seemingly insane world.  His self perceived 'moral superiority' is indeed a narcissistic delusion and a defense mechanism, but his feelings of rage and hatred toward a blind and sick society are very real and well founded indeed. I was hard pressed to find much optimism or hope in this movie, and our hero (or anti hero) is as sick and irretrievably lost at the end as he is at the beginning. It is basically a work of alarming pessimism and desperation, similar in many ways to George Orwell's ""1984"".

Robert De Niro plays taxi driver Travis Bickle, a down on his luck Vietnam vet who takes a job as a taxi driver to make ends meet.  What makes this movie amazing is how true to life it is.  All that Travis Bickle wants to do is be somebody.  He wants to be known for something.  The bad thing is he is willing to do anything to get his recognition.  Many people have connected with this movie because Travis Bickle's life seems to mirror theirs.  No one takes him seriously and nobody seems to care about him.  He is just another face in the crowd.  Many people have felt like him, maybe not to the point of murder, but they have related to him.  Scorsese directs this film like no other and De Niro plays Bickle brilliantly.  This movie has impressive camera work and one of the best shootouts ever.  Watch it!",999302400,2,877,4.3128834355828225
13632,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is one of the most powerful and disturbing films I've ever seen.
Paul Schrader's gritty screenplay is superb. He effectively creates a sense of loneliness in one of the largest, most highly populated cities in the world.
Schrader creates one of the most complex and disturbing film characters in Travis Bickle. Robert DeNiro also lends, significantly, to the character of Travis in one of the greatest cinematic performances ever. He perfectly captures the loneliness, complexity, and frustration of Travis. Jodie Foster gives a commendable performance as a young prostitute on the streets of New York City. Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd, and Harvey Keitel all give noteworthy performances.
Martin Scorsese uses many intriguing and unique camera angles and shots to tell this shady story; his direction really is quite good. I particularly like the long, over-head shot he used to conclude a violent scene at the end of the film.
Bernard Herrmann's romantic and sometimes ominous musical score nicely compliments the images on screen.
Michael Chapman's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lighting combined with Scorsese's unique direction and his occasional utilization of slow motion gives the film a very surreal look.
The picture quality on the DVD is fantastic, especially when you consider the age of the film. The documentary is very informative and advoids being ""fluffy.""
Taxi Driver certainly isn't a film for everyone. By showing you Travis's disturbing life, it will leave you feeling hollowed out but if you think you can stomach it; I urge you to give it a try.",997228800,7,1596,5.214007782101167

""Taxi Driver"" established Schraeder as a major screenwriting talent, Robert De Niro as a star and Martin Scorsese as the pre-eminent filmmaker of his generation.
The acting is flawless (was the ever a BAD performance in a Scorcese film)?...even Cybil Shepherd gives the illusion she can act....Scorsese himself, playing a jealous husband who's gone over the edge, is simply stunning.
""Taxi Driver,"" is a mixture of Urban Gothic horror and a psychological case study of the terror that can be wrought by loneliness and alientation, scored beautifully by the late Bernard Herrmann (can anyone watch the film without going around humming that haunting saxophone passage?)
This new special edition DVD is superb, containing a 90 minute documentary on the making of the film that includes interviews with many of the cast and crew ( Scorsese, De Niro, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Paul Schraeder, makeup man Dick Smith, and Elmer Bernstein, standing in for Herrmann).
The only element sorely lacking in the DVD is the commentary Scorsese did for the Criterion laserdisc edition.

The truth is, you don't need to. You learn enough about him, why he's where he is. The story is brilliantly portrayed as he is one man who is sick of the dirty streets that he drives day in and day out. This, however does not necessarily delve deep into your mind, doesn't really make you think. It is, basically, your typical book turned movie. It nearly reminds one of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" with no true point, other than to show what happens to man over a short period of time.

13641,5,0767830555,"Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece written by Paul Schrader to me is the ultimate film about loneliness and insanity. Two things that Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) obviously is. The movies starts out with Travis going to a cab company for a job. The reason is he can't sleep at nights. At his job he meets a lot of odd people in his cab. But, he also meets his share when off work too. Like fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle) whom at one point Travis tries confiding in. He really is loney and has no one to be with. All he does is drive his cab, untill, one day he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). She's working on political campaign for some politician. At first she thinks he's ""creepy"". Tom (Albert Brooks) has I would say a crush on her. At first he tries to ""defend"" her against him. After the two go out for a brief time. She becomes digusted with him after he tries to take her to go see an adult movie. At this point the insanity kicks in. He now starts to talk about how the streets of New York make him sick. Everyone is ""scum"". He can't breathe the air. In an effort to ""free"" himself, he decides to ""save"" a very young prositute Iris (Jodie Foster). The problem first of all is, she doesn't think she needs to be saved. She thinks things are going ok. Secondly, her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) says he loves her. ""Taxi Driver"" hits so many right spots to keep our interest. It has so many powerful moments. The acting by De Niro is truly a standout. His Oscar nomination was rightfully deserved. We see this transformation in his character, and to me, it's spellbounding. His ""our you looking at me"" speech has to be one of the most OVER quoted lines in film history, it's right up there with ""What am I a clown? Am I here to amuse you?"". Scorsese is a director of considerable outstanding talents and this film allows him to showcase it very well. He also has a small cameo as a jealous husband who is spying on his wife, who is cheating on him.

He is disgusted by all the filth and scum he sees in New York City, but he drives in the city's worst neighborhoods and picks up the slimiest of characters.  In voice overs, we hear him describe some of the debauchery that goes on in his cab.  He sees a beautiful young woman working in the campaign offices of a Presidential candidate.  He gets up the nerve to ask her out and they go to a luncheonette and have a nice conversation.  Then on another date he takes her to a pornographic movie and she is revolted by this and then spurns him.  One of the heartbreaking scenes in the movie is Travis calling her on a pay phone to apologize.  Martin Scorcese pans away from Travis and shows a long corridor while he is being rejected.  This sends Travis over the edge.  He gets a mohawk and plans an assassination attempt on the candidate which is aborted.  He also meets a 13 year old hooker named Iris.  He can't understand why she subjects herself to this life and why she is with a creepy pimp named Sport.  In the film's bloody climax, Travis kills Sport and ends up in a blood bath while Iris looks on horrified.  Robert De Niro plays Travis as powderkeg waiting to burst.

She plays the character with seeming self-assurance, but with an underlying fragility an amazing achievement for the then 13 year old.

It seems every actor in it became either a major film or tv star in the years after it was made 25 years ago. Robert DeNiro is at his finest as Travis Bickel, a New York taxi driver, who slips further and further into a breakdown state. He can't sleep so drives his cab all night long. He runs into an amazing cast of characters on the city's streets including Jodie Foster, a teenage prostitute who has Harvey Keitel as her pimp; Cybill Shepard as the idealized woman he wants to court (his idea of a date is taking her to a porno movie!); Albert Brooks as a political worker; Peter Boyle as a fellow cabbie; director Martin Scorsese in a cameo role as an obsessed husband watching his wife carry on an affair from the back of Travis's cab.  The soundtrack I've had for years too as it is the most gorgeous saxophone accompaniment.  Perhaps the most perfect aspect that struck me this time though was the writing.  Paul Schaefer's screenplay was dead on.  He grabbed ahold of Travis Bickel's paranoid, alienated world and delivered it dead-on to us.  If only other film-makers understood the need to start with an absolutely first rate script, perhaps more films would be winners like this one too.

The best things you can say about this film is the very beautiful filming, plus that it is interesting to watch very young Robert DeNiro's and even younger Jodie Foster's already then great talents. You also get glimpses of Harvey Keitel.

Travis is almost totally lacking in social skills and this leads to a disastrous date with Betsy (Shepherd) and an ever increasing sense of alienation from and disgust with the world around him.
A chance encounter with Iris (Foster) a child prostitute, increases Travis' sense that he must do something about the city. He wavers between taking action against the man in control of Betsy, politician Charles Palantine for whom Betsy is a campaign worker and the man in control of Iris, Sport (Keitel) her pimp.
A close brush with secret service men who spot him in a crowd makes his decision and Travis decides to free Iris in a bloody shootout.
It's not a bad plot but the movie is really about the alienation of one man from the city around him. In this, De Niro is totally convincing he is in the city but not of the city. He has a hard job too. A social misfit cannot be given a sharp snappy script. Instead, such a person will at times be an embarrassment to those around him and De Niro portrays this perfectly.
This definitely a ""must see"" film. It is well paced and keeps the audience's attention throughout. The settings and the atmosphere of the dark side of the city are convincing.

""God's lonely man""-that's Travis Bickle,the Vietnam veteran who spends his life driving a cab through the seedy streets of New York. He observes without taking any part. He despises the pimps, the prostitutes and the junkies. He welcomes the rain that will sweep the city clean of its filth. He haunts the streets as he begins a mesmerizing descent into his own personal hell. He's drawn to two women in particular: there's Betsey, the unattainable blonde campaign worker for a president wannabe, and there's Iris, a child whore who is in the thrall of a brutal pimp. At a certain point of the movie he sets out to win over these two women and at the same time atone for his own sins in an orgy of violence. His original plan to kill the candidate is foiled by the Secret Service, so he decides to descend into the squalor to redeem himself by rescuing Iris.  Like every kind of underdog Travis takes out his anger on the guy below him rather than the guy above him. He contemplates his arsenal before beginning his rampage. He is wearing faded combat fatigues and has designed a complicated holster contraption that would allow him to draw and fire much faster. He is surveying his handywork in a full-length mirror. ""You talking to me"" - he says as he spins and draws on a non existent opponent, savouring this moment. It's the picture of a man on the brink of the abyss! A truly wonderful moment of genuine movie magic!  Travis Bickle is a man who is in emotional pain throughout the movie. The pain and torment that Bobby De Niro endures on screen as Travis goes far beyond simply acting.

13654,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver has to be one of the seminal films to have come out of America. Blessed with a magnificent cast including Scorsese stalwarts De Niro, Keitel and a young Jodie Foster. The screenplay by Paul Schrader perfectly embodies the disjointedness of Travis Bickles mind, right from the start through to the sanguinary, almost hallucigenic conclusion. Bernard Herrmann provided his last score for this film and it is simply a sensational piece of work that will be stuck in your mind for days. The direction by Scorsese ( who also cameos as the guy in the cab looking at his wife)is masterly who he was not nominated for an Oscar for his work here is a great slight on the Academy. The film has become the ultimate statement against the emasculation of men by women and the rise of feminism. It was also Hinckleys defence for his attempted assasination of Reagan. The plot is quite simple it involves a Vietnam vet who has come home from war and is finding it hard to sleep so he decides he may as well get paid for driving around the city. From here we see random situations that Travis finds himself in. HE is a man that wants to ""clean the scum off the streets"" and yet he becomes what it is that he despises. Travis is best summed up as Betsy (Cybill Shepard) describes him ""a walking contridication"" From there Travis finds a young prostitute that he decides to try and take off the streets and such the stunning denouement begins to unfurl. This film is a magnificent experience. A must see for all who truly love cinema. The film was nominated for four Oscars (Picture, Actor (De Niro) Supporting Actress (Foster) and Score) and inexplicably De Niro did not capture the statuette. His performance in this film is one of the finest that you will ever watch. The endlessly parodied quote ""you talkin' to me"" came from this film. Although this scene is the most remembered from the film the breakfast scene between Travis and Iris is also one of the finest moments that modern cinema as captured.

The portrait of disturbed and lonely man, Taxi Driver is more than just a movie- it is an experience. Each scene in the movie contains (or is seen from the point of view of) cabbie Travis Bickle and by the halfway point his persona begins absorb you. You can feel his pain, his isolation and his desperate need to connect with somebody or something. In the hands of a lesser director or actor (De Niro's performance is beyond superlatives), this movie would have been a cold, lurid explotation of a sick mind but, instead, it is a searingly powerful meditation on violence that transcends its audience's desire to judge these characters. By the end of the movie you can feel the inevitablity of Travis's explosion and some of the scenes depicting his growing alienation are truly heart-wrenching.

If there was  a more inappropriate term for anything about this movie, it is  ""delightful.""  For anyone who hasn't yet seen this modern REAL  horror masterpiece, it is one of the most effective studies of frustration,  isolation and suppressed (for the most part) anger in today's world that I  have seen on film.  And, the movie works brilliantly despite all the  strikes against it; Paul Schrader's psychodrama/part pulp creation may have  fallen apart, were it not for Martin Scorsese's adept direction and the  gritty, committed performances of the lead characters, not in the least  Robert DeNiro as the alienated, deadened ex-Marine Travis Bickle.  I am  always fascinated by movies that have major contrasts in tone and style  within them; consider the scenes with Albert Brooks and Cybill Shepherd at  Palatine Headquarters, played at a (bad) sitcom level, then contrast them  with the hyper-realistic scenes of Travis's customers (Scorsese has a  bravura cameo as a murderously jealous husband), Harvey Keitel's greasy  pimping duties, the final massacre, and for me the most unexpected and  shocking display, the aftermath of the convenience store robbery which  Travis is involved in.  This is the stuff of nightmares.  The movie is also  populated with wonderfully odd supporting characters, including Travis's  fellow cabbies who have a camaraderie which feels real, and the  fast-talking gun salesman who brings his arsenal to Travis's apartment for  a sale.  After you've viewed it a few times (if you're so inclined!),  questions come to mind:  Why does Betsy even give Travis the time of day,  especially after their incredibly awkward ""lunch"" together?  Why  has Travis's character been written as SO clueless, sometimes distracting  to the point of amusement?  Doesn't Bernard Herrmann's loungy main theme,  complete with emoting saxophone, seem at odds with the unadorned realism  the movie is presenting us?  As it is, though, these aspects,  contradictions and all, are what make ""Taxi Driver"" a unique and  unforgettable experience.  There are a hundred different things worth  commenting on, from the look of the film, to the ironic ""message""  of the movie, etc.  But, for those with the mettle, this is one of the  best, and should be seen for those with any interest in contemporary  cinema.

When one watches  this film they are completely taken over by his performance and literally  in Travis Bickle's world.  This world is hard, cold, sleazy, unforgiving,  and most importantly lonesome.
A person like Travis Bickle existing in  reality, which he most certainly does, would probably be denounced by  society.  However, through the magic of Martin Scorsese and company this  sadly mentally disturbed person becomes a hero and role model.  Most people  would find this to be a very frightening concept, but there is a little bit  of Travis Bickle in every one of us.

Who has not dreamed of  doing something that they would consider ""really big"" in their  life?  Who has not joked or fantasized about taking the law into their own  hands?  As bad as it may sound, who has not had a fantasy about committing  a gloriously violent act?  From a male perspective, who has not helped or  wished to save a damsal in distress?

That critical opinion, I believe, is due to the fact that you can look at Jake LaMotta and abhor his behavior, making it easier to objectively examine the film's  traits.  But Travis Bickle is a character that is so well drawn by the  three collaborators scorsese, schrader, and deniro, that we as an audience  are terrified that all of us might actually bear something in common with  him.  This is not watered down entertainment, as scorsese explores the  corners of the mind  most people rarely will deny. And he does so with  virtuosity, lovingly crafting every shot and sequence, building mood and  tension like few others can.  Dismissed by many as mindless violence, this  is a film with a message that unites us all, and a protagonist so real you  can imagine a conversation with him, two things most all films cannot give.",964051200,,888,4.718954248366013

""Odeon"" is  almost 25 years old - the material is at least that old - yet you will  chuckle and cry and wish for more.  If you're a fan of songwriting and  eschew the posing commerciality of what passes for popular music, this is a  congealed example of the way things should be.

13664,4,0767830555,"After watching this movie, John Hinckley went out and tried to kill Ronald Reagan. This would indicate that ""Taxi Driver"" is a worthwhile movie. In more basic terms, however, the reason this is such a good movie  is because it shows how close the categories of ""hero"" and  ""psychopath"" are, and indeed, how close these categories are to  normal life.
Travis(Robert De Niro) is a young, lonely, slightly  obsessive taxi driver, who displays in the course of the movie, the two  main male passions - sexual love and fatherly love. The first of these is  directed towards a young professional, Betsy(Cybil Shepherd), a campaign  worker for a Presidential candidate; the second towards a child prostitute,  Iris acted by Jodie Foster.
the first of these passions brings him into  fleeting contact with the cold aloof world of US politics characterized by  empty sloganeering and an absence of policies. By actually meeting the  candidate, Palatine in his cab, Travis begins to instinctively realize the  connection between the messed up New York streets with their pushers and  prostitutes and the opportunism and cynicism of those who defile their  responsibility.
After being misunderstood and rejected by Betsy, these  vague political misgivings crystallize around his dented male pride and  lead him to plot the assassination of Palatine. As he prepares himself for  this, however, his paternal feelings are aroused by the plight of Iris, the  child prostitute, whom he resolves to rescue. Already living on the edge,  he decides that the best way to do this is by killing her pimp.
In his  mind these two goals become almost identical. Killing the apathetic.  patronizing politician, who is socially or politically responsible, and the  pimp, who is individually responsible for the abominations of modern city  life, like child prostitution, have little to separate them. Indeed, only  the candidate's security guards make the difference.
Foiled in his first  attempt, it is only the second of these goals that he manages to  accomplish. Ironically, the courage that would have had him damned as a  sociopath in the first case, allows him to become a hero in the second.
This film raises the question: Is someone who takes a gun and tries to  blow away a President or one of the other fakirs of the frenetic passivity  of ungovernment, a hero? The answer is probably yes.",963446400,17,2373,5.059431524547803
13665,5,0767830555,"'Taxi Driver' is one of the most passionate films ever made, everyone involved did it with such professionalism and dedication that you can't help but admire it. Scorsese scored big with this one, although this wasn;t  his first masterpiece, 'Mean Streets', another Scorsese triumph was made in  1973. Powerhouse directing by Scorsese, and brilliant screenplay by Paul  Schrader. But the acting is the thing that blows you away. Robert DeNiro  delivers one of the most expertly realized performances of all time, he  'was' Travis Bickle, the ultimate antihero, loneliness and violence have  never mixed so well together. His performance was basically a big  improvisation, the whole 'you talking to me' scene was never staged, that  was pure DeNiro. Travis Bickle is just about the loneliest character in the  history of cinema, and that's what 'Taxi Driver' is all about, basically  loneliness. Also a powerhouse performance by a very young Jodie Foster as a  12 year old prostitute, that's a role that could never be done again, even  now in the 22nd century. Cybill Sheppard and, surprise, Albert Brooks are  also good in support. An unforgettable film that really leaves an impact. A  milestone 70's film. Extras: you can spot Martin Scorsese in the background  in the scene where we first see Cybill Sheppard in her white dress, he also  appears as the psycho whose wife is cheating on him and takes Travis along  for the ride.

13666,5,0767830555,"Before you read this, I should tell you that I'm only 17 years old, for whatever that's worth. Now I can tell you how I feel about this movie. My father was telling me about how great Taxi Driver was. I've always loved  the classic movies, The Godfather, Annie Hall, The Third Man...etc, so I  decided to give this movie a chance since I enjoyed De Niro in Godfather  Part 2(The greatest movie of all time). I rented this and it just blew me  away. The script, the directing, the acting, everything is just amazing.  The script was very strong, but De Niro made it even better with his  improvisational scenes including the scene at the mirror. A young Jodie  Foster puts on a convincing performance, along with Cybil Shephard, Harvey  Keitel, and the other stars in this wonderous film. In the special edition  version, there is a segment after the film that is very interesting. One  piece that sticks out in my head was that the film was so incredibly real,  that the colors had to be toned down, because the scene in the apartment  with the shootout was too realistic. That should tell you how great this  really is. It was too good, too real, too perfect, so they had to make it  easier to stomach. In conclusion, this is one of the best movies I have  ever seen in my short life. I recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.  But be prepared to be blown away, thank you.",962150400,18,1376,4.400793650793651

I remember being surprised by the graphic violence, it being an  older film.  The story is a little dim and definitely unpleasant at times  but so is life.  I believe that the idea of a man becoming sick of crime  and filthy surroundings and has his boiling point makes sense.  See it for  yourself and try not to judge it based on bad reviews, especially Leonard  Maltin's.  De Niro was great in the film.  *Scorcese plays the nutty guy  spying on his wife.",961632000,2,608,4.427272727272728

Nothing truly grabbed me in  this movie and when watching it I always feel like I'm watching ""The  Emporers New Clothes"".  DeNiro is a great as usual but I can't see the  comparison with something like his Raging Bull performance.  Over the top  characters strike me as so easy to portray.  The 'everyman' seems so much  more difficult.  This is a cast of over the top characters who I don't  really relate to, who I'm not particularly interested in, and who don't  leave much of an impresson on me.

But on to my review. For  those who haven't seen Taxi Driver yet, they must. Other than the different  fashion styles, Taxi Driver could easily have been filmed today. It's still  so fresh and new, it hasn't aged a bit. Everybody in the cast gives career  preformances, and though it's one of Marty's earliest work, his style is in  full effect.
The film lets Travis Bickle speak & act for himself.  It's non-judgemental and non-exploitive, a fact that might make people  uneasy. Sure he's not right and sure he'll do it again, but that's the  point. There are many, many Travis Bickles out there. Travis flipped out,  and he will flip out again. And the reason why is answered by the newspaper  clipping towards film's end. The most disturbing thing, might be, in the  end, you love Travis. He has done wrong, very wrong things, but you love  him anyway, and actually agree with what he does to rescue Jodie Foster's  character.
An important, landmark film. And probably one of my all time 5  favorites. Great DVD to boot. Be sure you pick up the Special Edition,  though.",960681600,,1254,4.535714285714286

This film  contained brilliant music by Bernard Hermann which went perfectly with the  beautiful cinematography.  Robert De Niro gave a really good  narrative prformane along with general acting. The movie gives us this  tough talking ex-marine that applies for a taxi driving job. Not long after  our man is driving a taxi, and telling us about disapointments of the big  city.

Once you see this film it will stick in your mind until you die.  Obviously  the ""You talkin' to me?"" scene alone has entered the pop culture  lexicon forever, but there is so much more to this film than that. De Niro  amazes, Harvey Keitel turns in some of his best work ever as a sexy yet  sickening pimp, Jodie Foster portrays the latent innocence behind her  outwardly hardened teen hooker character, and even Cybill Shepard is  fabulous as De Niro's dream girl.  Schrader's script is an all time  classic, and Scorsese's direction is a miracle. (Check out the overhead  shots at the end!)  And YES, the score is grand.

The film has an urban feel and Scorcese truly captures the  essence of the city through magnificent cinematography.

A real keeper,  and one that can be watched many many times, each time the viewer brings  something new.  It is incredibly violent <take a look at the stills in  the documentary of the tracking scene with the intense color> and  slightly explotative (which is understandable before Mean Streets, Scorsese  did Boxcar Bertha for Coreman) but like Silence of the Lambs, the  explotation aspect is one in keeping with the tone and feel of the movie.",959731200,7,1025,5.0359281437125745

The picture and sound quality of this DVD are consistently great - only let  down by a grainy section at the end of the movie, where the original print  had to be desaturated (to satisfy the censors by making the scene look a  little less... red).  The making-of documentary is approaching an hour in  length, and features the director, many of the crew and all the significant  actors. Robert de Niro, Jodie Foster, Martin Scorsese and the make-up /  special effects artist provide the most interesting behind-the-scenes info,  but the whole documentary is intelligent and well-made.  In addition to  that, you get a storyboard section where Scorsese's original sketches are  matched to the corresponding scenes in the movie, and you get the whole  original screenplay, with each section linked to the related movie scenes.  Also the original (melodramatic!) movie trailer is included.  All in all, a  very good conversion.  I hardly need to add my thoughts on the movie - I  agree with all the excellent reviews here.

13675,5,0767830555,"Martin Scorscese's Taxi Driver is a highly detailed, superbly engrossing masterpiece, enriched with the subtle nuances of its New York surrounding. The acting in this movie is top notch right down the line, starting with De  Nero's complicated, devoted and compelling  portrayal of the  lonely,detached, and disturbed taxi driver. The performance encompasses a  large facet of qualities, from full scale, rage driven agenda to subtle  exspressions of loss, bitterness, racism, confusion and self indulgence.  His eclectic performance moves in and out of these qualites heightening his  prescence in the flic. The others all play their parts as you would expect  to see such characters in real life, and in there lies Taxi Driver's  strength. It's ability to give a surreal yet almost documentary account to  the stories look and pacing brings the viewer deeper into the story. The  DVD brings out the best in a movie that looked more than slightly dated on  VHS, and also puts in a nice goody bag, complete with an excellent  ""Making Of Taxi Driver"" that includes over 60 minutes of well  documented sources and info. The DVD's low price and bright pallete of  colors( save for a few instances of grainyness or oversaturated orange)  make a tempting bargain.

13676,4,0767830555,"Taxi Driver is one of the most important film in the American cinema of  the 70's . Also, after almost a quater of a century after its release, it  still is an exciting as well as  horryfing experience to see it. What is  discribed in this movie is still chillingly true in our days.

For  Scorsese fans, the Criterion Laser Disc was long thought to be a must-have  item. The transfer used in this new DVD looks quite different from the  Criterion version which was surpervised by cinematographer Michael Chapman.  Frankly, the LD looks better than the DVD, or at least it's more beautiful.

The rich colors of the Chapman-trasnfer is not on the DVD. The color looks a  bit desaturated and often off-balanced. For instance, in daylight interior scenes like the lelection campaign office,  what you see outside the windows are simply too blue. It looks more contrasty and  you loose certain details in the shadow area.  But I do not dislike this  transfer: while the Chapman-trasnfer makes Travis' Urban Hell look a bit  sexier, Hell's Kitchen in this version is tough, gritty and merciless. The  desaturation of colour employed on the notorious ""blood bath""  sequence is more effective in this transfer (By the way, Chapman himself disliked the effect, so apparently he tried to minimize it on his supervised trasnfer). If you have the chance to see  the film on screen with a good print, the effect is devastating (Scorsese  applied the same technique in Bringing Out the Dead, this time throughout  the entire picture) .

The DVD also features an insightful series of  interviews from the filmmakers including Scorsese, writer Paul Schrader,  Michael Chapman, Robert De Niro and the other cast member, and the special  make-up creator Dick Smith. The interviews with the supporting cast,  especially the one with Albert Brooks (who played the presidential election  campaign worker) is particullary interesting.

Another interesting function  is that you can compare the film with the screenplay simultanously, and  understand how Scorsese preserved the structure of Schrader's script while  filling in more details that makes the characters and the story alive. This  DVD is really worth buying if you like the movie. You can see it  repeatedly, and learn a great deal about how it was made. But I think  Criterion should re-issue their version (with audio commentary by Scorsese  and Schrader) on DVD as well (and also Raging Bull).",958953600,2,2436,5.005
13677,2,0767830555,"I just don't get it! I wanted to love this movie. Maybe I had to see this movie at the theatre as an adult back when it was first released? At any rate, my opinion is that it simply stinks.
Of course DeNiro is compelling  and interesting, but I felt no sympathy for any of the characters in this  movie. Jodi Foster is often lauded for her role in ""Taxi Driver""  but I don't see why. It was small and one dimensional and (I feel) not  particularly well acted. And Cybil Shepard? Give me a break! Lousy acting  can never be covered up with a soft focus lens. I did like Albert Brooks,  however.
And the ending? What is that all about? It makes no sense, has  no logic and is not even profound (which it must be if logic is thrown out  the window). Just when this movie should've been over there is another 15  minutes tacked on that should've been left on the cutting room floor. It is  almost as if the studio exec's said, ""Hey, uh, Marty? That ending is  too gruesome and unresolved. How about tidying it up nice and neat for us,  eh?""
I like many of Scorsese's movies (especially ""Good  Fellas""), and of course I always enjoy De Niro's acting, but I found  no redeeming value in ""Taxi Driver"". I think one had to see it  back when it was first released to appreciate it. Otherwise it is dated,  poorly written, and ultimately pointless.",958521600,7,1338,4.292

The image is excellent (aside from a few rough patches with noticeble grain and wear & tear) and the remastered sound is incredible.  That would  have been enough for me, but the extras is where this disc really comes  through.  First off is an excellent 70-minute documentary that covers the  film from its beginning stages to the end (if you ever wondered how they  accomplished the final showdown, or how they did that wonderful overhead  tracking shot, or who the inspirations behind the charcters were, you will  find out here) with interviews from the cast and crew.  In addition to the  trailer, there is a storyboard (drawn by Scorsese) sequence that details  how the bloody end will be shot and a comparison with how it came out.  There is a wealth of behind-the-scenes photos and a gallery featuring promo  materials and poster art.  But the coolest feature is Paul Schrader's  complete screenplay, featuring scenes that never made the final cut and a  neat option to jump to the scene you are reading.  I'm glad they put this  on the DVD and did not make it a DVD-ROM extra, since those of us who care  about the movies like to watch them on our TV screens and not our computer  screens.

Scorcese's direction is  almost flawless - defining camera shots, moody photography and an ending  that portrays how outstanding a director he really is.
Many find this  film too disgusting, especially the violent ending.

13680,5,0767830555,"Taxi Driver, though many would disagree, is what I believe to be Deniro's finest performance.  The extensive research he put into his role before ever stepping in front of the camera is commendable, not to mention rare.  If you've seen Mean Streets, also directed by Scorsese, you know how  effectively Deniro can portray losing his mind on screen.  I strongly  identify with this movie, in that I feel extremely anti-social now and  then.  I think most of us do occasionally.  The soundtrack is another  item worth purchasing on CD.  Written and conducted by Bernard Herman, the  music seems to slowly simmer, then crash, only to return to sweet melody  again.  If you listen closely, you can sense Herman tuning in to the  mindstate of someone slowly descending into madness, moving between states  of faltering calm and violent bursts.  Simply put, it is my favorite of  all movies, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to become immersed in a  characters life. There's plenty of humor, sincerity, violence, sexiness,  and above all the dialog between Deniro and Foster in the restaurant is  priceless. Deniro's performance is flawlewss and completely surreal.  Definitely not a party movie, Taxi Driver is best when viewed alone (at  least for the first time.)  You can't help but evaluate where you stand  mentally when you watch this movie. Don't bother renting it, just buy it!  Also, if you can find them, there are posters available of Deniro as Travis  Bickle, a gun raised up in each hand, smiling that insane laugh of his, complete with the  mohawk.  The poster's black and white, and is a must have once you've seen  this movie.  Well, hope you buy it,watch it, and love it!

These people say things like ""an ugly, gory decent into violence"".  And they're right.  But they can't seem to see the difference between this movie's violence and  the violence you normally find in movies.
  The film is violent, but  it is not about violence.  It's about loneliness (""You talkin' to me?  I'm the only one here"").  Some people can say that Travis is a sick  man (i.e. Leonard Maltin)or a psycopath (i.e. jcack)(which is completely  inaccuate) and look away from the film.  These people I feel sorry for  because they don't dare to let the movie inhabit them and that's what it's  supposed to do.  What makes it one of the best films ever made is the fact  that it never leaves Travis.  It makes you relate to him.  Every single one  of us has looked in the mirror and said similar things.  And we've all had  some thoughts along the same lines as him (feel like a pimp that has a  twelve year old girl hooking for him should be shot).  We don't all act on  them,  and that's what makes this such a powerful film.  It has us go along  with Travis and we care for him (we start to say ""oh no, don't take  Betsy to the porno theater!"").  We feel the rejection when he is  dumped.  We feel the fear disguised as hate and it makes us uncomfortable.  And it should.  It takes our thoughts to the next level as he purchases  guns and we wonder, but we still relate to him.  And then at the end there  is a violent, graphic shootout that is brilliant because by that point we  are Travis.  It scares us to know what we are all capable of.  Most people  won't admit it and that's why the film is so brave.
  As for the ending  (many people think it's hard to believe Travis wouldn't be in jail), who's  to say it happened or not.  It could be a dream or a halucination after he  has died, or it could be real.  It doesn't matter.  That ending is very  important.  It is of great significance that we see Travis at ease and then  reconciling with Betsy before he looks up and is frightened by his own  reflection.
  As for the people who don't appreciate this film, I  strongly suggest that you watch it again with an open mind.  After all,  you've only got one brain, it would be ashame to waste it.",951436800,19,2329,4.222988505747127

13686,3,0767830555,"During the 70's most of us were just trying to get into something.  Taxi Driver gave us the deep hole side of something gotten into.  Realizing that perfectionism was an ideal and not necessarily  a icon to live by.  Robert Deniro demonstrated a surreal exploration into the minds ability to  take you where you really want to go.  We see a sdubtle begining and the  effects of  lost efforts and misguided youth turning into the  last chance  at saving if not one own soul than atleast a soul that is considered worth  saving.
  In these times we reflect more on not taking advantage of  youth.  Yet youth begins it's advantage of the moment and forgiveness for  innocence.  There a many Taxi Drivers in todays youth.  But the real  vocus is not the redemtion but the brutality of the event and then the  redemption",947894400,,815,4.566433566433567
13687,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" is an effective, gritty work that is both a masterpiece and unforgettable. It is, I believe, the first movie that really showed the brilliance of Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul  Schrader. This is a dark, disturbing journey into madness, realistically  capturing the mean streets in all their realism. Travis Bickle (Robert  DeNiro), is a deep examination of a man falling deeper and deeper into the  abyss of madness. Driven even deeper by what he sees in the world around  him. Schrader's screenplay at times has the feel of a documentary, as does  Scorsese's adaptation onto film. ""Taxi Driver"" vibrates with a  realism seen in few movies. Maybe that's why it has stood the test of time  triumphantly. Seeing this movie once is not enough, because you need to see  it more than once to really get what it's saying, to truly understand it.  Scorsese's film is gritty and at times, shocking, but not dumb or bloody  just for entertainment. ""Taxi Driver"" explores through Bickle,  the nature of crazy people, really getting into the mind of a lonely man  who doesn't know much about the outside world because he seldom goes out to  explore it. The film is always interesting, Scorsese brings it to life  through the settings, camera angles and cinematography. The shoot-out at  the end is one of the most brilliant ever filmed because it seems  realistic, but not over-exagerrated, it's shocking, but we understand it.  ""Taxi Driver"" opened doors for more filmmakers who wanted to make  movies that didn't hold back, that were realistic in their representation  of the dark corners of society. It stands as a brilliant work which will be  studied and endured for years to come.",946857600,27,1697,4.925795053003534
13688,5,0767830555,"""Taxi Driver"" deals with a whole range of uncomfortable and undesirable topics which unfortunately hits too close to home in today's society.  Infamous as the precursor (and in at least one case, the  inspiration) for celebrity stalkings, attempted murders, and  assassinations, the movie is nonetheless riveting, and with all due respect  to ""Mean Streets"" and ""The Godfather Part II,"" this is  the first great DeNiro film.  The translation to DVD is wonderful, with an  interactive screenplay and a richly detailed ""making-of""  documentary. I would have loved a play-by-play commentary from Scorsese,  Schrader and DeNiro, but the documentary covers most of the bases, so no  big deal.",946684800,2,687,5.39622641509434
13689,4,0767830555,"The widescreen transfer of the origional (minus the real reds in the final blood bath - now lost forever-see documentary) is magnificent. Nothing is lost, and the tech. buffs should be happy. The sound is stereo and crisp  (what a sound track) and the 70 min. documentary is icing on the cake, its  amazing how much improvisation there was in this movie.
The movie, well  its early Scorsese, and while not his best, still a real winner. Watch in  particular for the camera movments, angles, and ""daring"" shots  that the film crew were so amazed  when shooting it under  ""Marty's"" direction. Enjoy.",946252800,2,597,4.794117647058823

13691,5,0767830555,"This is Scorsese at his best.  not only do we geta genuine look at New York City but we also get into the psyche of a strange and intricate man. DeNiro plays a somewhat psychotic taxi driver who is out to change the  city.  His life is very passive.  He works all day, watches television, is  unsuccesful with the ladies, and does not talk much.  After seeing a hooker  on a street, that he belives is being harmed, he proceeds to arm himself,  get in shape and prepare for battle.  He wants to be a someone in a city of  nothings.  The greatest thing about this movie is that it is a little  ambigious on explaining DeNiro's motive.  We feel like he is going crazy,  yet it is all for a reason.  He wants to save the girl.  He kills a number  of people and then becomes the hero.  He is no longer passive.  He has made  a difference.  Scorsese has some great images in this film.  The final  scene where he adjusts his mirror does not mean anything, yet it stands out  as the most memorable moment in the whole movie.  This film shows why  Scorsese is regarded as one of the great autuers of today.",944438400,6,1099,4.188405797101449
13692,5,0767830555,"""Mean Streets"" put Martin Scorsese on the map, but he carved a place for himself in the annals of film history with this disturbing tale of ""God's lonely man."" What's most disturbing about Travis Bickle  is the way that we almost understand his actions in this film: he's so  lonely and isolated that he's locked away from the rest of the world,  letting his obsessions drive him to the boiling point. Scorsese's film  style is remarkable and utterly hypnotic: there are scenes in this film I  find my self watching over and over again, as the soft voices, silence, and  tension lock my eyes to the screen and put me into a trance. The scene  where Travis puts his weapons together, in particular, is so magnetic that  it simply grabs you and will not let you go.",944006400,4,763,4.518248175182482
13693,5,0767830555,"I have to admit I didn't enjoy Taxi Driver when I first saw it.  I thought it was slow, grainy, and dull at times.
Like many of Kubrick's films though, it's a movie you really have to see twice in order to appreciate  it.  The screenplay is truly one of a kind and you'll never see such a  character study ever.  Travis Bickle will go down as one of the most  dynamic characters in cinema.
I believe this is Scorsese's finest piece  of directing.  Take a look at his subtle camera movements and you will  really notice how a normal scene is enhanced by his slight touches.
If  you are not familiar with this film, let me tell you that it's a raw,  gritty character study that takes place in the most hellish parts of New  York.  It's not your typical story and most people will find it disturbing  or ""weird.""
If you don't like these kinds of movies, don't  buy this.  However, if you love great dialogue, character studies,  directing, and a fantastic music score, pick up Taxi Driver and watch it  more than once.  You'll discover the genius each time.

13697,4,0767830555,"TAXI DRIVER is the un-relenting tale of one man's journey into insanity while driving a cab on the streets of New York City.  The many situations that Travis Brickle (a bloody brillinat performance by Robert DeNiro)  encounters and the many people he meets while drivng this cab at night send  him into a downward spiral of hate and contempt for everyone and  everything.  The fact that he is a Vietnam vet really seems to play a role  in how affected he is by this incredibly obscene and disgusting society.  Being dumped by a woman with whom is incredibly fond of, in addition to  meeting a 13 year old street hooker all further establish as a sort of  morality tale which questions both our society, and the people affected by  it.  The harsh yet mellow aura of the film is sharpley interupted at the  end by an incredibly violent climax which may be too much if you're not  expecting it.",938649600,,891,4.528301886792453

The special edition has great  extras and an informative documentory about the movie.  I recomend this  movie one hundred percent.  Ending's of movies to me can either make or  break a film, and the ending to this movie is just magnificent, I was not  even expecting it to end this way, it took me completly by suprise.  Get  this movie, it is great, I had not even seen it before buying it, I just  had a hunch that it was great and it was.  Watch out for Jodi Foster to,  she is only in the film for a little while but man does she do a wonderful  job. I give this movie a big High Five.

Dark, gritty,  and unflinching look at New York in the 70s and into the Darkside of humanity and the inner workings of the lost mind. Basically Paul Schrader exercising his demons that most people will find relatable, though few would admit to having this person inside them...But we all do, its just that some cant stare the beast down & instead let it take over.

Aside from all that armchair critic stuff this Blu-ray is particularly good, its the best Ive ever seen this film look and the extras package, spread out over two discs, is more than any fan could ask for, and currently available for less than $10 its a steal.

Highly recommended for anybody who is a fan of 70s filmmaking and isn't afraid to look at the Darkside of human nature.",1519516800,,813,4.510204081632653
