8455104,1,B0053CBO8C,"I hate the fact that is DVD was not in English. Wanted to see this film since I was a child. When thought I finally found it I was so excited. However only the introduction was in English. If you  should happened to find the DVD entirely in English, please let me know. Still wanting to see the film. It's one the old original ones and it's good!",1493596800,,346,4.088235294117647
