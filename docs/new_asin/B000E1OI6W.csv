2482768,5,B000E1OI6W,"The whole monologue is witty and intelligent, but the extra feature showing Ron and friend ""back in the day"" is worth the price of admission.  His friend's unexpected remembrance of drinking water out of the water hose after piling up the dogs at the quik stop place to get a decent lunch for around seventy-five cents -- Ron's paid his dues.  He's surprised that fans want to pay his bills.  Ron, you keep it coming, we want to supply a steady income stream.  This is good stuff.",1145318400,4,480,4.482758620689655
2482769,5,B000E1OI6W,"Following up his hit DVD ""They Call Me Tater Salad"". Ron White's ""You Can't Fix Stupid"" is ten times more hilarious; Ron White's comic genius grows with every DVD/CD he puts out. Here we have Ron White talking about his new wife Barbra, at one point Courtney Love, his honeymoon in Greece, the effects of a period on one's sex life, ""Petticoat Junction"", you name it...Ron White makes a joke about it. I think that next to George Carlin, Ron White is the most talented and funny comic around today. The man's got a great way of telling jokes and almost every joke is a hit. If you're at the video store and want to rent something that will make you laugh your a$$ off, you can't go wrong with this DVD...And if you can, you're stupid. And you can't fix that.

2482770,3,B000E1OI6W,"Ron White has always struck me as a funny comedian, and when I heard Drunk IN Public I was hooked on what could be a great comedian so instantly when i saw Cant Fix Stupid I bought it right away expecting that same outrageous comedy I heard on his Cd but was slightly dissapointed when he wasn't quite up to snuff with his new material. I do give credit to the fact he created new material, because I bought his PLatinum CD ""Call Me Tatter Salad"" Along with Comedy Centrals ""Southern Gents Of Comedy and saw that his skits and Comedy were the same on both DVD;s and his Cd, so I was a little dissapointed he had nothing new but in this new DVD Cant Fix Stupid Ron comes out with BRAND NEW Material, and its not terrible, it is funny but I have heard alot fo Dane Cook recently and you just cant compared to the SUFI Master. However I will keep this DVD and throw it in from time to time when I want to hear some crude Southern Texas Humor",1144540800,2,938,4.103260869565218

2482895,3,B000E1OI6W,I am a big Ron White fan and have seen all his current standup DVDs/specials.  But this one is not nearly as good as his original works.  The comedy is more like he is phoning it in and the audio was chopping (very loud and then very quiet).  Definitely not his best work.,1408924800,,272,4.09433962264151

2482924,2,B000E1OI6W,Ron White is great! This version was edited down to just over 40 minutes. Too much left on the cutting room floor in my opinion.,1403740800,,128,4.16

2482928,5,B000E1OI6W,"Ron White is raunchy and lewd. But, he has very honest stand up. The fact he can do the whole set drinking scotch is impressive. I bet his liver is crap though. His premise that you can fix any physical problem is dead on it. But, if your stupid that is genetic and can't be fixed. Kinda like my first wife! I would recommend this to any one but, be prepared to cringe at some of the remarks and statements. What is strange is my reserved, proper wife LOVES HIM!",1403049600,,462,4.144444444444445

2482951,2,B000E1OI6W,I stopped watching after the first 15 minutes. Did not think this guy is very funny. Could not get into his routine.,1402790400,,116,4.318181818181818

2482953,1,B000E1OI6W,"I forget that good comics like Mr. Right can be more expressive when their recording is not sponsored by PBS, HBO, etc. Comics are the more free to express opinions or observations in more racey language.

2482955,1,B000E1OI6W,"Very poor taste. Not funny. Loaded with obscenities that added nothing to the routine.

Not one bit funny and totally unacceptable to joke about an individual with a disability.",1402444800,,290,4.705882352941177
2482956,1,B000E1OI6W,I don't like his comedy.  Humor is timing and he hasn't got it.  You can see it coming with his punch lines.  If you talk about a fire truck speeding to a fire and racing inside the building on fire you would never guess that the fire truck lost it's brakes.  etc.,1402358400,,264,4.019230769230769

2482991,4,B000E1OI6W,"I enjoyed this movie. You have to realize that Ron can get a little or ""really"" raunchy. Since I am a senior, I watch it only alone or another adult.  He covers a lot of topics and all of them funny.  Another issue that would keep the young from watching would be that he smokes and drinks liquor all throughout the show.

Bearing that in mind he is hilarious and his act while looking improvised is tightly controlled whether it be Ron's gestures, Ron's slightly off center humor, and even his choreographed blue humor.

By using skills well polished over years of doing stand-up comedy, he delivers an injection of humor, and knows when he can leave, and leave the audience wanting more.",1391385600,,515,4.764044943820225

He seems very preoccupied with discussing his male anatomy and telling everyone about his private life with his wife.  I really don't need or want to know about that.  It's not funny, it is forced and artificial humor for not having to be creative.  (Granted I was really offended by his ""A Little Unprofessional"" schtick!  That show was way more offensive.)

Mr. White finds humor in everyday situations, much like Bill Cosby. This seemed like a collection of shorter anecdotes, many focused on audience members he had seen, and various parts (well, OK, one part) of his personal anatomy.

2483199,5,B000E1OI6W,I absolutely love the humor displayed by Ron White.  Has the knack for delivering punch lines at EXACTLY the right time and his animated expressions are funny in themselves.  Looking forward to other show by him.,1388275200,,212,4.861111111111111
2483200,2,B000E1OI6W,"Sure he's funny sometimes but if you've seen him before its the same old thing with a different wife and the same disgusting jokes, pretty much the exact same jokes.

No matter what show, we would always give him five stars. If he didn't own a plane, hang with Dr. Phil and Mary Pat, and was middle class, I know we would be great friends; and that's what he projects when he performs. That he's approachable, down to earth, and just too funny for words! I'm so glad we discovered him. It had been a while since a comedian had come along that we really liked since Bill Hicks passed.

He takes on what could be gender offensive subjects while somehow managing to make you laugh at yourself (and him). Basically saying out loud what many of us think.

He makes being smart look effortless, AND his wife is a freakin genius. I mean, I can't think of a single woman who wouldn't agree that her chocolate idea alone is worth spending millions of research dollars on! Enjoy. MFJLabs 4x",1371168000,,522,4.736263736263736

In fact, we only watched a little over half of it, took it our of our DVD player and threw it in the trash.  Ron White is a fabulous comedian, soooo funny, but why he feels it's necessary to use horrible lanuage in his shows, I will never understand.  I'm sure some people like that but more of us don't.  And there is a lot of material out there for him to work with so why does he feel it necessary to ALWAYS concentrate on his sexual relationship with his wife, in great detail I might ad, and with
very explicit lanuage.  He talks about the size of his penis, (now does any one really care),and how he uses it demonstrated with his clothes on, and the things he enjoys being done to him, etc., etc., etc.  He has just gone WAY TO FAR!  Bring back the old Ron White from the Comedy Group.  HE WAS SO FUNNY THEN AND HIS ACT MUCH CLEANER.  DO THAT RON WHITE AND WE WILL BUY THOSE DVD'S.  BUT WE WON'T BUY ANY MORE OF YOUR TRASH!!!!

2483346,5,B000E1OI6W,"I laughed so hard watching 'Behavioral Problems' that I about fell out of my chair!  Jeff Foxworthy said on one of the 'Blue Collar Comedy Tour' shows that the best and funniest material the comedians get is from the things that happen to them in real life. Several of Ron White's real life stories here are so similar to things in our own day to day lives that not only can we relate, but his way of telling the stories, with his delivery, quickness, and ohh some of those faces he makes tie this all together into one major non-stop laugh-fest that you'll still laugh about days later thinking about some of the stories. This is very much ADULT comedy and the jokes get a bit more and more adult as it goes on. Even though adult language isn't a 'big hit' with me, Ron's way of telling the stories has every naughty word in 'just the right places' to where you'll totally be splitting a gut laughing. Be careful if you watch this DVD late at night though, as you'll surely wake up your household laughing so loudly!
As funny as this DVD is non-stop, there is a small bit where Ron tells about how he along with Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, and Bill Engvall all visited our severely injured troops at the Walter Reed Medical Center in D.C. that brought me to tears for a minute, but the laughter came roaring right back. I first saw this on Netflix, and decided that I HAD to have my own copy so here I am to purchase one here at Amazon. 'Behaviorial Problems' is a definate MUST own for your own Comedy DVD collection if you enjoy laughter in a stand up bit from start to finish handy to you when you need a really good laugh to get rid of the blues and/or have a hard day and just need to laugh - A LOT!",1300752000,7,1714,4.225609756097561

2483350,1,B000E1OI6W,"""You cain't fix stupid"" describes this extremely disappointing DVD perfectly.  I loved ""They Call Me Tater Salad"" so I purchased this one without my customary ""due diligence"" of making sure someone whose judgment I trust recommends it.  There were maybe two funny jokes in his stand-up routine.  I'm no prude and I can tolerate foul language if the jokes are funny.  But 90% of this DVD was just juvenile potty-humor suitable only for preteens who think foul language alone is funny.  The only part of the DVD worth watching was the behind-the-scenes section, but that was only worth $1.99.  This was a waste of time and money and it will be a LONG time before I buy another Ron White DVD because of it.  It was stupid and Ron's right ... you can't fix that.",1284854400,4,758,4.57037037037037

2483359,2,B000E1OI6W,"Ron White is on the smarmy, arrogant skids and ""Fuzzy"" is just a crock.

First of all, while I used to be a major Ron White fan, he's now gotten too mean spirited and monotonous and downright strung-out to find many new colors or variety in his humor. He comes off more like a nasty, rich, burn-out these days. And while raunch doesn't make me squeamish at all if it's clever or truly funny, I can state without a doubt that there are plenty of ""tried and true Texans"" who do not care for Ron White's kind of humor and never did.

Furthermore, as a fourth-generation Texan from a six-generation Texas family I have to say old Fuzz ain't got a clue what he's talking about. You would be hard-pressed to find a car with ""longhorn cattle horns"" anyplace but a custom auto museum these days...and very few beehive hairdos. I have my suspicions that old Fuzz ain't even a Texan at all; he yaps about Texas cliches that are straight out of Hollywood more than the real Lone Star State. The ""Fuzziest"" notion is that anybody would presume to speak for the Texas sense of humor with such tired generalizations, muchless equate it all with a trailer trash sensibility when this great state was built by a lot of tough pioneers who would have booted the likes of Ron White out in the street if he ran his mouth in such a manner in mixed company or behaved publicly the way Ron White brags about. Left up to the likes of him, there would never have been a Texas because he would have had to suffer too much and display too much true character.

I'm not saying that Ron White has not been extremely funny at times or that I never belly laugh at his observations or tone. But his is nothing more or less than raunchy adult nightclub humor with a twang--not something that is a synonym for anything purely ""Texan"".

I would just add that his tale of how he behaved toward the parking lot attendant speaks volumes about Ron White's current state. There was a time when that attendant would have been Ron White, and there's little doubt---based upon his own past testimony--that he also would have been sleeping on the job and belligerent on the job. Just like he is now in so many ways.",1245456000,7,2171,4.42

2483361,2,B000E1OI6W,"Saw this with a friend of mine. I never saw the blue collar comedy tour, so i wasn't sure what to expect. Heard alot of raunchy comedy. Sadly the mark of a great comedian is one that doesnt have to fall back on vulgarity (mitch hedberg for instance) I mean really? making crude suggestive body movements simulating sexual activity? This is middle school humor at best. The whole montage where he harasses a parking lot attendant who was trying to do his job reminded me of listening to old washed up sailors talking about their glory days. Also what kind of person who is so proud of the fact that he is a Texas would admit on the air that he drives a Range Rover? Ron White stumbled through too many jokes. Also read up on his arrest record and FAA problems. Kinda funny that a man that is trying to ride the dying coattails of ""redneck humor"" would actually be branded a terrorist by most of the rednecks watching this dvd.

This is not a ""family friendly video"" --most people would not be comfortable watching this video with grandma and the kids in the room.

I'm not just referring to the language here either --there are a lot of very direct sex jokes in more detail than a lot of people would be comfortable with.

He said that this is probably going to be his last video because he wanted to spend more time on the road.  I think it should be on the road to recovery.",1244851200,8,491,3.7281553398058254

His routine was loaded with so many F-Bombs, and other cursing that it detracted from everything he was saying.  It is as if all he has to rely on now is profanity.  Some profanity can be good, but Ron White jumped over the line of what is reasonable.

Sorry Ron, but you are not funny when you are dropping F-bombs in every sentence.

Ron while a member of the ""redneck"" squad really speaks for a different crowd called Texans. Especially with this latest release, ""Behavioral Problems"" he speaks to those of us who are tried and true Texans. Each state has its own brand of humor and Texas is no exception. Some of Ron's jokes will appeal to all crowds but if you are from Texas his humor has a special meaning that very few outside of Texas will fully appreciate. Ron speaks for the """"beehive hairdo"" women and the guys who have longhorn cattle horns on their cars. Texans like our women pretty and demure out of the house and hot as call girls behind home doors. We also really adore Ron White and his ""take no crap"" attitude. A true Texan, dyed in the wool.

I put him and his storytelling ability in the class with a select few, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby (at his best). This DVD proves that point.

Even though it is a repeat of his basic stuff, the line: ""You can't fix stupid"" that appears in the title, is priceless, a virtual career maker that fits all situations and obviously refers to some of our most revered political leaders and office holders, one of whom shall remain nameless.

Ron, in my view, is still the best of contemporary comedians and is getting better, but admits that he is lazy. Well, he'd better tell his writers to get busy, as I don't have to tell him that Comedians are very perishable and have a very short ""shelf life.""

Ron is definitely the best of the blue collar bunch.  Foxworthy is OK, I'm not really familiar with Engvall, and I can't stand Larry the Cable Guy.
