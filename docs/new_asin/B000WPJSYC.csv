8224902,3,B000WPJSYC,"I don't know why they bother to call this movie Desert Gold. It certainly has no bearing on the original Zane Grey story which was typical Zane Grey with lots of action, romance and description. This setting is even completely different. They should have called it something else and been done with it. The original story is about a drifter who comes to the Mexican border by chance and meets an old friend. together they save a girlfriend from a ruthless Mexican bandito who is nowhere to be found in the movie. I would like to know why they changed the original story and the original characters so much. The role of Laddie, a sidekick, would have been marvelous for Al St. John. This movie is all right as a typical 1930's western, but as far as it being Desert Gold, it isn't.",1523577600,,780,4.461538461538462

8224908,2,B000WPJSYC,"It's obvious that Alpha Home Entertainment spends quite a bit of time designing clever, catchy, and colorful DVD cases. It would be nice if the same care and consideration were afforded to some of the films I have viewed inside those cases.

""Desert Gold"" is another example of a beautifully designed DVD case that contains a movie with a picture that has a light and dark contrast that is often washed out. The sound, while not great, is okay. As for the content of the film itself, ""Desert Gold"" is a rather mundane and annoying adaptation of the Zane Grey novel.

Tom Keene plays the hero, a geologist who is looking for a lost gold mine that is supposedly on land owned by the local Indian tribe. But in ""Desert Gold,"" he just seems to give a bored and uninspiring portrayal of a Western hero.

A very young Robert Cummings is terrible as Keene's assistant who is there to provide some comic relief in the movie. The only relief is when he is not on screen. He is supposed to be someone who is afraid of his own shadow and not very bright, and all of his eye-popping ham acting wears thin in a hurry.

Buster Crabbe, one of my favorite B actors, is totally miscast as a young Indian chief who knows the location of the gold mine and is not about to tell the outlaws, even after he is captured and tortured by them. Crabbe's overly stern expression on his face with his arms crossed during most of his scenes was an image of a Native American that had been basically discarded in Westerns, even back in 1936 when this one was made.

The only two bright spots in this Western are the great Raymond Hatton who plays a crusty, old doctor, and his daughter played by the very beautiful Marsha Hunt. Both of these actors light up the screen and provide a little luster to ""Desert Gold.""

So if you happen to be a fan of Raymond Hatton, Marsha Hunt, or Buster Crabbe, then ""Desert Gold"" may be worth a passing glance and adding to your collection. And speaking of Marsha Hunt, as of this writing, she is still very much alive and active at the age of 93.",1316131200,2,2051,4.356020942408377

The story line and plot, The story starts out with Maya (Buster Crabbe) being made chief of the local Indian tribe.

Kasedon has sent for mining engineer Randolph Gale (Tom Keene) to help him find the mine --- Aboard the stagecoach with Gale are the comely young Judith Belding (Marsha Hunt) who, as it turns out is engaged to marry Kasedon --- Travelling with Gale is his assistant, now get this, Fordyce Mortimer (Robert Cummings in an early role) and Judith's father Doc Belding, the town doctor --- At first Gale is unaware of Kasedon's misdeeds but when he finds him whipping Maya to make him talk, he promptly switches sides and pursues Judith on the side --- Cummings though a little over the top is nonetheless hilarious as the comic relief --- Marsha Hunt was never prettier as the heroine --- Keene does a creditable job as the hero --- Watch for Leif (billed as ""Glenn"") Erikson as Kasedon's brother and Si Jenks in a hilarious bit as the stagecoach driver --- Veteran heavy Walter Miller also appears as (what else?) one of the bag guys --- All in all this is a first rate Zane Grey story.
