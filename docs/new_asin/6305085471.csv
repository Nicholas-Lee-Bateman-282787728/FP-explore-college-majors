966842,2,6305085471,"The WWF obviously didn't want to sell very many of this video, you just have to look at the front cover to prove it. The main event features Kane  and Mankind led by Paul Bearer put their WWF Tag Titles on the line against  Austin and Taker. The elements are all there it's just the main event never  really comes together, there are a lot better WWF videos to buy then this  one, and you must be fully loaded if you're gonna spend money on this lame  pay-per-view. Lazy booking by the WWF.",966211200,,490,4.225806451612903
966843,4,6305085471,"The first ever WWF Fully Loaded event took place in July 1998.  The main event was for the WWF Tag Team Championship.  Champions-Kane and Mankind defend their titles against WWF Champion-Stone Cold Steve Austin and the  Undertaker.  THE ""Skin To Win"" bikini contest between Sable and  Jacqueline.  This one had everyone on their knees...especially THE  MAN-Jerry ""The King"" Lawler.  In a 2 out of 3 falls match, WWF  Intercontinental Champion-The Rock puts his belt up against HHH.  This  match proves that the WWF does not know how to handle their real true  talent.  To put the two best conditioned athletes in the WWF today in a 2/3  match with a 30 minute time limit does not leave the match with too much of  an ending.  WWF European Champion-D-Lo Brown, in a non-title match, takes  on X-Pac in an excellent one on one encounter.  Scorpio and Faarooq team up  to face Terry Funk and Bradshaw.  Val Venis takes on Jeff Jarrett.  Vader  and Mark Henry go at it on a battle of the bulls.  L.O.D. 2000 vs. Paul  Ellering's D.O.A.  Plus, the Dungeon Match between Owen Hart and Ken  Shamrock with Dan ""The Beast"" Severn as the special referee.",938563200,3,1144,4.651515151515151
966844,5,6305085471,The main event was sweet and the same can be said  about the 2 of 3 falls IC title match and the rest of the card was good/great.,932688000,,129,3.607142857142857
7883071,5,6305085471,"1.) Jeff Jarrett w/Tennessee Lee vs Val Venis

Fair paced opening match that sees Venis get the win with a roll-up on Jarrett for the victory. Yamaguchi San came out to do commentary on the match, leading to Jerry Lawler asking him some inappropriate questions about his wife

2.) WWF European Championship Match: D'Lo Brown w/The Godfather vs X-Pac (c) w/Chyna

We get a great European Championship match here from D'Lo and X-Pac. While I am in no way an X-Pac fan, he and D'Lo had great chemistry in the ring and an underrated feud in the Attitude Era. This match moves nicely for the most part and was a great one to sit through. Following a bit of outside interference from Godfather, D'Lo hits the Lo Down on X-Pac for the win and the European Championship

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the backstage online room, there's rumors swirling that The Undertaker hasn't arrived at the arena, leading to speculation that something may have happened to him

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Flash Funk and Farrooq vs Terry Funk and Bradshaw

This was a boring and pointless match. It was kind of weird to see how far Faarooq had fallen off the grid after he was no longer a part of the Nation of Domination. Flash Funk gets the pin on Terry Funk with a 450 Splash. Following the match, Bradshaw snaps and lays out Terry, Flash, and Faarooq.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Vader vs Mark Henry

A surprisingly decent battle of the giants match that lasts a short bit. Mark Henry gets the win on Vader with a Big Splash for the win. I never understood why Vader basically became a loser in 1998 after his feud with Kane.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Kane, Paul Bearer, and Mankind come to the ring and Bearer taunts Undertaker and Stone Cold. This leads to the New Age Outlaws coming out and laying down a challenge to Kane and Mankind for the Tag Team Titles the next night on Raw. It all erupts into a brawl that gets broken up by referees

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) DOA (8-Ball and Skull) w/Paul Ellering vs LOD 2000

The story behind this match was that Paul Ellering, LOD's manager from back in the day, returned and turned on LOD. The LOD want revenge and this also lead to Hawk's infamous and forgotten alcoholic storyline. Plain story with a plain match. 8-Ball hits a DDT on Animal for the win.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Vince McMahon comes to the ring with his stooges and says not to blame him if The Undertaker no-shows the main event match. McMahon puts the blame on Austin and uses Austin's treatment towards The Undertaker over the weeks as his method of reason. McMahon goes on to announce that if Undertaker doesn't show up for the match, Austin's partner replacement will be *drum roll please*........The Brooklyn Brawler!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Dungeon Match: Owen Hart vs Ken Shamrock  (Special Referee: Dan ""The Beast"" Severn)

A short but fun and interesting match to watch, as I believe this was the only Dungeon match to ever take place. We get a nice bit of ground wrestling but things go awry quickly when Shamrock accidentally knocks Severn down with a roundhouse kick. Owen takes advantage and knocks Shamrock's lights out with a dumbbell. Owen locks in a crossface and uses Shamrock's hand to make him tap out and Severn awards the match to Owen.

7.) WWF Intercontinental Championship 2 out of 3 Falls 30 Minute Time Limit Match: Triple H vs The Rock (c)

DX and The Nation are sent to the back before the match begins, allowing these 2 to have 30 minutes of pure awesomeness in the ring. These two show an amazing mix of styles in the ring in this exciting back and forth 30 minute bout. Helmsley and The Rock go on to battle to a draw that leaves fans wanting more. You knew this feud was far from over; as Rock and Helmsley would go on to have many legendary battles going down the line

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Bikini Contest: Jacqueline vs Sable

Before anything got under way, Dustin Runnels came out and prays about the engagement of those in the upcoming bikini contest. Jacqueline goes first and struts her stuff in a fairly revealing attire. Sable goes next and reveals a ""conservative"" top that Vince McMahon advised her to wear earlier in the day but she has her own idea of ""conservative"" and rips off her top to reveal her bare chest with her boobs being covered by a skim hand print bikini. McMahon comes out afterwards and covers Sable up with sports coat and sends her to the back. So the winner is Sable but would you expect anything less

9.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Mankind (c) and Kane (c) w/Paul Bearer vs The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin

Following the events of the King of the Ring, the big question was were The Undertaker and Kane secretly in cahoots. The proof certainly looked to be in the pudding in the weeks leading up to the PPV as Undertaker seemed to unintentionally (or was it?) have Kane's back in certain situations. Great match to close out the show! Loved every moment of it, beginning to end! This was a treat to watch that told a story. The booking of the drama between Undertaker and Steve Austin as well as the anxiety as to whether or not Undertaker and Kane were working together, was amazing and even Lawler and J.R. did good at putting emphasis on the Stone Cold/Undertaker story. In the end, we find out our answer as Stone Cold makes the hot tag to Undertaker and the Lord of Darkness cleans house and pins Kane with a Tombstone Piledriver to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.

Overall: Yet another solid PPV event from WWF in 1998. The booking for most of these matches was purely amazing and it served as an amazing prequel for SummerSlam, which was looking to be perhaps the hottest WWF PPV in 1998 in terms of booking. Although the WWF Championship wasn't defended in the main event, it didn't really matter as it didn't take away from Austin or the prestige of the title. Overall, I give Fully Loaded a 5/5 stars",1406419200,,6845,5.513384321223709

7883073,4,6305085471,"The Jeff Jarrett-Val Venis match was kind of boring but still good. The match between D-lo Brown & X-Pac had lots of high-flying action and it was pretty good. The Faarooq/Scorpio-Terry Funk/Justin Bradshaw tag team match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Vader-Mark Henry match. The D.O.A-L.O.D 2000 tag team match was slow & boring. The Owen Hart-Ken Shamrock-Dungeon match was a solid/back-and-forth bout even with Owen cheating at the end. The 2 out of 3 falls match for the IC between The Rock & HHH was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,entertaing,smash-mouth match of the night. The Jacqueline-Sable-Bikini contest was pathetic & dirty. No matter how much men loved it. Leave those dumb constests for bars & beaches. The World tag team championship match between the team of The Undertaker & Steve Austin against the team of Kane & Mankind was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,ruthless,entertaining tag team brawl.

July 26, 1998

Selland Arena

Fresno, California

Val Venis V. Jeff Jarrett

Good watchable match that had it's high points. Venis wins. **3/4

D'Lo Brown V. X-Pac

This two all always solid in the ring against each other and this one is no exception. Good match with D'Lo going over. ***1/4

Scorpio & Faarooq V. Terry Funk & Bradshaw

ok match that had Scorpio & Funk doing some old ECW stuff. Scorpio & Faarooq win. **

Vader V. Mark Henry

What's with the Henry push? He beats a former World Champion in Vader and then beats the Rock in October. I really don't know what Vince sees in the guy. I think he is a useless talent. 1/2*

LOD 2000 V. DOA

This is like the 900th time these two teams had met and every single match sucked and this one sucks also. DOA win. *

Dungeon Match:

Ken Shameock V. Owen Hart

Awesome. The Dungeon is tiny and not many people knew that before this match. Very solid wrestling with a very good ending. Owen wins, ***3/4...or course Owen is going to win, it is in his own house

2-Out-Of-3 Falls Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship:

The Rock (Champion) V. Triple H

This match could have been better if the first fall came a little earier and didn't have a godamn time limit! Why would it have a time limit is behind me. So you guessed it...it ends in a time limit draw. ***3/4

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Kane & Mankind (Champions) V. Stone Cold Steve Austin & Underaker

Why isn't the WWF Championship on the line? It would have been cool. Anyways we get a good Tag Team Match that really wasn't anything special but was solid. Austin & Undie win the titles. ***1/2

Overall a godd show that had the only Dungeon Match and a bikini contest that everyone seems to remember more than the main event. I don't blame them.",1138752000,2,1788,4.384146341463414
