7905533,5,B000009DNZ,"Love story, comedy, and tragedy wrapped in superb scenery and sound.  The photography tells the story brilliantly even without the clear Khmer dialogue or the English subtitles.  Anyone who has ever been to Cambodia  will want to own this film. Students of the Khmer language will find it an  excellent and challenging study aid.  Those who will never be likely to  have the opportunity to visit Angkor and Siemreap will experience a taste  of the region's natural beauty.  Includes a beautiful traditional wedding  ceremony.",955584000,5,525,5.154761904761905
