8451514,1,B0050MVHM8,I was sent this video in a format that cannot be played in the U.S. To convert it to a playable format I would have to spend a lot of money. I returned it.,1374883200,,155,3.588235294117647
8451515,5,B0050MVHM8,"I bought this DVD as a gift for a colleague of mine who is a big Indian Cricketing fan. Of course the DVD for the World Cup 2011 which I feel is the one of the most deserving and tough performance from the Indian team. The product was shipped fast and without any issues, it reached in time for the occasion. Since this was a gift, I did not get a chance to view the content. If and when I do, I can update this review.",1330819200,,419,3.883720930232558
8451516,3,B0050MVHM8,"Waited forever to get it through Amazon. Finally arrived and am a bit disappointed...

The overall video compilation for the tournament is good. Says region free but PAL settings screw it up. Wish they had it in blu ray too!",1315958400,2,224,4.6
8451517,3,B0050MVHM8,"I ordered both video's. For one I was disappointed that these DVD's won't play on my PS3 and had regional lock on it. I took it over to my computer and popped in the DVD and it played.

The ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 - Official Highlights were a bit disappointing as the matches weren't covered in great depth and were just skimmed over. I wanted a little more detailed package in the highlights.

ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 - Diaries was equally disappointing as I expected reactions from a lot more players and after each and every game. I didn't find that here. I wish that the ICC would take a leaf out of NFL's page and create collector's items as they put out.

8451518,5,B0050MVHM8,"Fabulous DVD. The highlights were more lengthy than I anticipated, giving me a better feeling for each game that I watched. I also bought the ICC World Cup Diaries which was also an excellent documentary and behind the scenes details of the teams and the whole event. I enjoyed both these products very much and would recommend them very highly.",1312156800,,345,4.766666666666667
8451519,1,B0050MVHM8,"The packaging was poor, the DVD was scratched and it would not play. When I tried to play it on my Toshiba DVD player I got only audio and no video. When I tried playing on Windows Vista, it complained that the video was not authorized to play.",1311292800,3,244,4.104166666666667
