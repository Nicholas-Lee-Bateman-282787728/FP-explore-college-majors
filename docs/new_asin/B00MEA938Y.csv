6568207,4,B00MEA938Y,"Once again this multi-talented team has produced a high quality film with a storyline that draws you in. Hope and moving on from the past and handicaps is key to this film. Jack and Elizabeth finally decide to pursue a courtship, Abigail moves on to a new level of independence in opening a restaurant, Adam Miller (the only miner to survive the explosion) returns and his family must adapt to his diability, and Elizabeth works to help a student overcome a reading disability.

Watching as each character overcomes fears and failures and works hard to attain goals is inspirational and, not only teaches a lesson to the viewer, but entertains as well. A wonderful balance is struck between the drama and the humor and makes for a wonderful film suitable for the entire family.

 I received this DVD compliments of Word Films and Edify Media for my honest review. I was not required to write a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own.",1408838400,,963,4.754491017964072
6568208,4,B00MEA938Y,"I have always been a Janette Oke fan so I was excited to watch When Calls the Heart: Second Chances when I saw it was inspired by the best selling series. I also really like Lori Loughlin so it was nice to see a familiar face.

I have not seen any of the series before this and it was obvious I was coming in on something in the middle but I was still able to enjoy and appreciate it without having watched any of the episodes. It actually got me curious about the show so now I want to see it from the beginning to find out what Ive missed. What was clear is that this show, produced and by Michael Landon Jr. is a good, clean, wholesome show without any questionable content. Its something I would not have to pause if my kids walked in the room or leave any bad thoughts in my head.

I liked the teacher Elizabeth and her passion for her job and getting one of her students to read, which in turn has an inspiring little twist about who he is able to help. Lori Laughlin as Abigail is a pleasure to watch and sweet as always. I really enjoyed When Calls the Heart and look forward to watching more of it! If you're looking for wholesome, this is the one!",1408492800,,1157,4.092511013215859
6568209,5,B00MEA938Y,"Just on the cusp of the first season coming to a close, When Calls The Heart, a series from the Hallmark Channel and adapted from the best-selling series from Janette Oke, finds a calling in the hearts of television viewers. Now this amazing series is available on DVD, and Second Chances, finds Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) at her wits end after finding out that the man she was falling for, Billy Hamilton was only out for Elizabeth's family fortune. When Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), lets it slide that Elizabeth has no money, Billy decides Coal Valley isn't for him after all. Now Elizabeth begins to doubt her own emotions and once again is indebted to Jack. Jack struggles to find a way to convey the true feelings he has for Elizabeth and offers to take her to dinner, but with a lack of somewhere to take her in town, besides the saloon. Jack opts to help Elizabeth out with one of her students so they can spend time together.

Elizabeth is excited when a shipment of books arrives to aid one of her students Bo Grady that is struggling to read. She feels that if she can get him excited about reading it might provide a light to a future outside of mining.  It seems that the more Jack tries to convey his feelings for Elizabeth, the more he puts his foot in his mouth. Once again the two find themselves at odds. Elizabeth finds solace in talking things over with her friend, Abigail Stanton who dreams of opening a restaurant in Coal Valley. But first she has to get permission from Mr. Gowen, who owns everything in Coal Valley, including the mining company. Even though the store has sat vacant, she seems determined that she can make it work and its something the town of Coal Valley can use. But Mr. Gowen seems determined to prove to Abigail that a woman can't succeed at anything without his help. The only way he'll provide the cafe to Abigail is if she is willing to leave the row house she's lived in since her husband and son died.

Adam Miller is about to make his homecoming after corresponding with his family while recovering from the mining accident. What he failed to tell them was he has lost his legs, even though his family is more than thrilled to have him home, he sees himself as less than a man, and one that won't be able to provide for his family.  He realizes that even though he is finally home, it may not be the best place for his family. Now if they can only convince him that it isn't about his leg that makes him a husband and father. Things are about to get interesting when Elizabeth is put in charge of the annual production of the Coal Valley Founder's Day parade with no time to prepare and everyone has the highest expectations that it simply be the best. But will it?

I received When Calls the Heart: Second Chances compliments of Word Films, the Hallmark Channel and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed in this review are strictly my own. Not since Little House on the Prairie has their been a series this good and I am thrilled that I am able to share this with my entire family. It is produced from Michael Landon Jr who is following in his father's footsteps with producing family friendly shows. I love that we can all sit and enjoy something that is wholesome, without any questionable content, and suitable for all ages. There is so many great things about each episode and in this one it is all about second chances for each of the characters, from Jack and Elizabeth attempting to work on building their relationship, showing Bo Grady there is more to life than mining, and even for Abigail who has the opportunity to begin rebuilding her life after losing her husband and son. Hands down for me, one of my favorite series brought to television, and I can't wait for season two to begin soon. This DVD rates a 5 out of 5 stars and is part of the When Calls The Heart series. You will want to pick them all up and watch it from the beginning. This DVD is 85 minutes long. This is the fourth DVD in the series. The order is #1 Lost and Found, #2 A Telling Silence, #3 The Dance, #4 Second Chances and #5 Change of Heart.",1408406400,8,4182,4.4189364461738005

6568232,5,B00MEA938Y,"After Constable Jack Thornton nearly loses teacher Elizabeth Thatcher to con man Billy Hamilton, Jack is suddenly struggling with his growing feelings for Elizabeth. Elizabeth is caught up in trying to help an older student who has trouble learning to read. When Jack makes an attempt at asking Elizabeth for a date, she agrees, but requests his help with her student in return. Widow Abigail Stanton is struggling to find her new purpose in life. When Elizabeth compliments her cooking, Abigail decides to try to open a cafe, however, doing so means losing her house. In the meantime, the only survivor of the mine explosion returns home from the hospital. He and his family struggle to adjust to his handicap - the loss of his leg. After an argument with his wife, the man leaves town, and Jack has to track him down and try to get him to see that his life was spared for a reason. And who painted the likeness of Jack and Elizabeth on the new backdrop for the Founders Day play??? ;-) This dvd contains the 7th and 8th episodes from the Hallmark tv series.

6568235,5,B00MEA938Y,"They don't make television like this anymore. The words of executive producer Michael Landon, Jr. confirm it:  Yes, its old fashioned to make this show in a world where meth deals and vampires are TV heroes, but Im okay with that. Our cynical culture needs to get back to a few old-fashioned themes like redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, courage and being good neighbors. How glad am I that Michael Landon, Jr. and Brian Bird have combined their talents with those of gifted writers and actors to bring When Calls The Heart into our homes. It functions as more than just a television show. It does more than entertain. When Calls The Heart warms the heart, offers hope, brings healing, and lends peace.

On this visit to Coal Valley, we make the acquaintance of the Grady family. Though intelligent and uncannily gifted in model building, the Gradys son Bo struggles to learn to read. Elizabeth is in a unique position of serving as both teacher and counselor. As is her habit, we see Elizabeth dive in to help Bo with unrivaled compassion and determination. Meanwhile, she and Jack are trying hard to bury the hatchet and move past their petty disagreements. Its a real treat to see Krakow and Lissing continue to build upon their already strong chemistry, giving Jack and Elizabeth a solid footing in friendship that could finally take hold. We also see another friendship taking root and producing fruit: that of Abigail and Elizabeth. Abigail lost both her husband and son in the mine disaster, and though stalwart and wise, she feels rudderless beginning a new chapter in life without them. She and Elizabeth serve as sisters and confidantes to one another, sometimes offering encouragement but mostly just an understanding ear, a safe place to land.

Though life goes on, the aftershock of the mining incident is still felt. In the second half of this feature, we witness the homecoming of the only survivor of the accident: Adam Miller. Adams been convalescing in the hospital, only he didn't share the extent of his injuries with his wife and family. Award-winning actor Chad Willett plays Adam, bringing a powerful portrayal of a wounded warrior who, changed far beyond merely the physical aspect, struggles to pick up the pieces of his life and find his place in the home and town to which he has returned a broken hero. Just as Elizabeth plays multiple roles, Jack is constable, friend, neighbor, and brother to Adam when things get rough.

As in prior episodes, once again the resourcefulness and resilience of the community of Coal Valley comes shining through. As the children put on their Founders Day program, youll experience a gamut of emotions. These uniquely brave children of this Western Canadian mining town will tickle your funny bone, and bring a smile to your face and tears to your eyes. Youll be glad for having taken time out of your noisy life to sit a spell in Coal Valley.

Verdict: 5 of 5 hearts. High-Caliber Television That Nourishes the Heart. When Calls The Heart: Second Chances continues a standard of excellence for which this Hallmark Channel Original Series is known, raising by yet another notch what was already a high bar.

6568237,4,B00MEA938Y,"When Calls the Heart Second Chances with Erin Krakow and Daniel Lissing is another fantastic adventure in the When Calls the Heart series inspired by Janette Oke.
  In this DVD Elizabeth and Jack try to become friends again, Elizabeth tries to help out one of her students who has a reading problem, Abigail wants to open an abandoned caf and Adam Miller comes home from the hospital, he was the only survivor of the coal mining accident, with only one leg. So you put all of these great plots together and you have one fantastic movie.
  The acting, scenery and talent of this DVD are excellent.
  You have very funny scenes and also scenes that are very serious. It all comes together to form one great DVD. I recommend this DVD When Calls the Heart Second Chances.

6568238,5,B00MEA938Y,"This delightful series has our full attention! Hallmark's adaption of Janette Oke's Christian novels reminds us of such classics as 'Little House On The Prairie' and we have enjoyed the wholesomeness of the stories produced by Michael Landon Jr.

For those of you who have not yet the opportunity to see an episode, When Calls The Heart is the story of a 19th Century young teacher with a privileged background whose first classroom assignment is in a small coal mining town.

And if like me you have been watching every episode until now, you probably found Second Chances to be the best of all episodes with friendly Mounty Jack struggling to find a way to express his feelings for lovely Elizabeth.

Let me add that the Special Features are not to be missed if you want an in-depth idea on how
the series is produced!

When Calls The Heart reflects the sort of family entertainment we hope to see more on the screen: it brings wonderful messages to one and all and features stunning scenery and beautifully detailed costumes.

5 Stars!

6568239,5,B00MEA938Y,"I am so in love with this movie and the series, in general!  Every movie that comes out and I watch it, the story is either great being continued, or just by itself.  It's also great to be able to watch it with my husband and our son and not worry about what is in the movie, or what is being said and have the story be one that we love to follow and see how it ends.  My son was even talking about things last night after we watched it and for a 13 year old to enjoy it means A LOT!!

The story was great, and I'm now at the edge of my seat wanting to know what will happen next.  These are some of those movies that just make you want to find the town that they are based on and visit it to meet the people and tell them how great their story is and how much you are enjoying the movies.  Michael Landon, Jr. is doing an amazing job keeping something that is based on older times to feel current and something we can mesh with and understand what's going on.
