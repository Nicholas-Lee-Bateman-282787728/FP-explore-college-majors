8133074,5,B000GJ0LAE,As soon as I saw this DVD I knew I had to have it. I had seen Daniel Cook on TV so I knew I liked his videos. I have really enjoyed watching the 12 videos on this 72-minute DVD. I highly recommend this DVD for adults and children. I absolutely love Daniel Cook.,1439078400,,261,3.8518518518518516
