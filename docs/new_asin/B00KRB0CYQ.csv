8660945,5,B00KRB0CYQ,"My students and I discovered Alphablocks this year and we love them. Yes, I like them too. Great phonics instruction in an entertaining way. This is a British production so they have British accents and pronunciations, So occasionally I will need to explain differences between US pronunciation and British pronunciations and that they call the letter z Zed. A minor inconvenience for such quality, engaging videos. Being a British production, these are not US DVDs but we watch them on my interactive board through my laptop with no problem. As soon as I loaded the DVD it prompted me to change my region settings and we were off and running. If you are going to watch them on a DVD player you will want a multi-region player.",1529366400,,727,4.732283464566929

Since these are region 2 & I'm in the US I had to use my computer to rip them to digital format.",1476662400,10,178,3.5641025641025643

8660952,5,B00KRB0CYQ,"We live in the united States so most DVD players won't play this, but we run Linux on our computers and this allows us to play DVDs from foreign countries. Our computer is hooked up to the TV so the DVDs played without issue! My two year old loves these videos! She can identify all the letters on the alphabet except maybe 2 letters. I highly recommend this for toddlers as long as you have a Linux system, or a DVD player that doesn't block foreign DVDs.",1461369600,5,456,4.252873563218391
8660953,1,B00KRB0CYQ,This was a much anticipated purchase. Unfortunately I was unaware of regional codes and the seller did not explain that these DVDs only work in UK coded DVDs players. So now I own a wonderful education set of DVDs that I must go purchase another DVD player in order to use.,1460592000,6,273,4.372549019607843
