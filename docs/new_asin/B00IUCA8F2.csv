6297366,5,B00IUCA8F2,"Aimee Mann and John Doe are a wonderfully witty pair! The music industry related ""truths"" portrayed in this film were seriously humorous -- without an obviously scripted attempt. With the help of an equally talented and unique supporting cast, I was surprised at the ease of their performance flow. As a music industry professional, I felt ""Pleased To Meet Me"" has such a natural feel, it's as if your truly observing a real moment in music history.",1398211200,3,449,4.8441558441558445

8645502,1,B00IUCA8F2,"OK jacket.  Waterproofing lasted about 1.5 years and a side zipper didn't last a year!  Company makes you jump through multiple hoops for repair even when under warranty.  If you can get it cheap, suggest that you keep your receipt in one of the waterproof pockets...as long as  they stay closed.",1464048000,,296,4.745098039215686

8645506,5,B00IUCA8F2,"I've seen Pleased to Meet Me twice.  Once was at the Kentucky Center for the Arts, where much of the cast and the directors were present to answer questions after.  So perhaps my review is a tad biased, given that I got to learn more about the movie, from the people who made it, and put the story in context.

However, I must tell you that any movie with the same name as my favorite Replacements album has some pretty tough standards to live up to.

Pleased to Meet Me not only lived up to my expectations, it surpassed them.

Should you expect to see Hollywood stars in this movie?  No.  Should you expect the slick touches of a big Hollywood budget to be on display?  Nope to that either.

Pleased to Meet Me is an independent film, made by people who love movies, and created by people who love the music to which the film pays homage.

If you want to see a fun and funny indie, and not a typical Hollywood extravaganza, you'll be pleased with Pleased to Meet Me (see what I did there?)  I loved seeing some of my favorite music personalities play different ""versions"" of themselves in this film.  The musical talent, by the way is a veritable who's-who of some important and revered folks in the music industry.

John Doe, alone, is worth the price of admission. Karen Bergquist, Joe Henry, Aimee Mann, and Loudon Wainwright III are all artists you've undoubtedly grooved to if you have a more discerning ear than simply top-40 radio.  It is a lot of fun watching each of them puzzle out how to portray a personality which, according to the men who made the movie, actually diverged a bit from their natural ones.  In fact, most of the cast are full-time musicians (including the cool Adam Kramer who has played with one of my favorite bands when I was a teenager, The Meat Puppets).

But let's not forget to mention the fabulous work of Andrew Pyle, as the film's primary comic relief.  I've never seen Andrew in anything where he didn't make me laugh.  Truly funny guy.

In all, a very enjoyable film.  Especially for music fans.  There is a charm to it and it accurately portrays the slightly claustrophobic atmosphere of what it was probably like to do this in real life (Pleased to Meet Me is based on a true story from the radio program, This American Life); it must have been like herding cats to get a rather large collection of musicians, who had never met, together and record a song in one day.  But they did it in real life and they did it in this movie too.

Guys, you did Paul Westerberg and crew proud.  I recommend you give this indie title a try and predict you won't be disappointed.",1407196800,,2607,4.417190775681342
8645507,3,B00IUCA8F2,"I wanted to watch this movie mostly because of the presence of Karin Bergquist, the greatest singer on Planet Earth. The premise of the movie -- gathering musicians from classified ads, who have never played together before, to work in a studio for one day -- was intriguing, as was the presence of musicians like John Doe, Aimee Mann, and Loudon Wainwright. But the movie's direction, pacing, and writing was not as good as I had hoped. Most of the performers were musicians, not actors, and it showed in places -- the acting was a bit uneven. Still, the musical parts made up for a lot. If you're a hard-core fan of some of the performers, this is worth a rental.",1406419200,2,665,4.5041322314049586
8645508,2,B00IUCA8F2,"Given that Aimee Mann and John Doe were the stars of this film, I was hoping to be entertained.  Both are highly accomplished singers.  However, that's the main reason why this film just ended up disappointing me.  Neither have the star quality to lead a film and the supporting actors, with the exception of Karin B from OVER THE RHINE, fared less successfully.  The premise of the film was great--what happens when you bring musicians together who don't know each other for one day to do a song.  In fact, had they just filmed it with no script, I think the results would have been increasingly more captivating.  You barely see the characters come together as a performing unit--each person gets a scene or two and yet you know very little about them by the time the song comes together.  I adore Aimee Mann and John Doe; I think the director just didn't know how to coax a great performance from the minimalist script. It's too bad as I ended up not being too pleased to have spent 90 minutes watching this film.",1404691200,3,1016,4.51912568306011
8645509,5,B00IUCA8F2,"I really loved this movie.  Saw it twice during a limited run in theatres.  I love movies just for good old fashioned storytelling, but love it when a movie does more.  This movie does much more.  For me, ultimately Pleased to Meet Me is about hope, redemption, freedom (escape), second chances and even the curse of perfect pitch.  Its an original story, has good character development, witty and relevant dialogue, interesting subplots, and excellent acting, editing and direction.  My wife and I (were in our 50s) saw this with our son (age 22) and a friend.  We all agreed we wished it was longer.  These are very interesting multi-dimensional characters that we got to know well and wanted to know even better.  Overall excellent indie movie-making!",1402444800,2,754,4.920634920634921
8645510,1,B00IUCA8F2,"I love Aimee Mann's music.  This film is awful.  AWFUL.  It was painful to continue watching, which I only did hoping it would redeem itself at some point.  It never does.  I own 16000 films.  This would be one of the worst 20.",1402444800,2,227,4.162790697674419
