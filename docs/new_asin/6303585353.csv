685314,5,6303585353,"Using a lot of the prep school imagery of Dead Poet's Society, The Browning Version is an outstanding story with a great cast.  Albert Finney gives what I would consider an Oscar worthy performance throughout the  film, and both Julian Sands and Matthew Modine played complex and  interesting supporting roles.  My only complaint of the film is that I  would like to have seen these two secondary characters developed more.  I  would actually like to see this story two more times, with each of these  two characters playing the main role and seeing the story from their points  of view.  I would hardly call this a fault of the movie, however.  Like a  great novel, often what is not included in the story is as important as  what is.  Although I don't want to draw parallels because the movies  are completely different, but I think if you enjoyed Dead Poets, you will  like this one.",918172800,7,886,4.619354838709677

I guess the most shocking moment in this film was the time out for Tea right in the middle of a major Cricket match. They took their good ol' time too! Not sure how accurate this portrayal was but I was dumbfounded. All that energy, excitement and sporting man's virulence, and whamo, time for tea???

Albert is too understated in his role here. I found the only scene with his response to the Browning Version gift, exceptional, heartfelt, and very compelling.

I had trouble with so many other themes, i.e. he was married to someone 20-30+ years age difference and they were together for FIFTEEN YEARS??? This was not Victorian England mind you, move on fer cryin out loud. She was absolutely gorgeous and bored out of her mind and how could two fascinating folks be so shut down, mean and plain unable to have a fun conversation? It made no sense whatsoever.

If he had more than 20 years with the school and still not eligible for a pension I guess that rather confused me. I thought they said he was there for 18 and why would he expect an exception, he was an offish social moron! These days, how many people are fired after 30+ years of service and leave with absolutely nothing, and this is within major Fortune 100 companies! Extremely sad but more common than not.

We had Latin studies in Junior High and figured it might be fun to sit in on a class or two given that I spent most of my youth in Catholic school with Mass providing my greatest insight into the holiest of phrases. I can sing in Latin and can even translate a few lines from the movie ""Tombstone"". WooHoo!

This film just plodded along too slowly for my taste and I am one of a prodigious appreciation for dialog and finer elements of intrigue. Hence, I sadly cannot recommend this for anything but a complete anthology of Albert Finney screen productions.",1440806400,,1871,4.520710059171598

4) The dramatic transformation, and ultimate redemption, of the main character by the love of one student and the friendship of another teacher
5) The disappearing love of the Classics which once characterized English, and even to an extent, American education

This piece of dreck turns the story on its head (the teacher is still full of life, the young boy seems like one of the walking dead).

685424,5,6303585353,"I have both the 1951 and the 1994 versions of ""The Browning Version"" and I recommend both of them. (There are a couple of TV versions which I have not seen.)
Overall I prefer the 1994 version, but the 1951 version has a couple of notable areas where it is better. The main one is the character of Mrs. Crocker-Harris. In the 1994 version Laura (as Mrs. Crocker-Harris is known in the 1994 version) is really to open with her feeling for Mr. Hunter. Everybody in the school would have had to know about the affair, it was almost obvious from the first scene they had together. In the 1951 version Millie (as Mrs. Crocker-Harris is known in the 1951 version) was more hateful and devious which I felt was more suitable for the character.
The other area where I felt the 1951 version was far better was the ending. I will be careful in the way I word this so as not to be a spoiler, but I found the ending of the 1951 version better in two main points. First, I felt the way things worked out between Mr. and Mrs. Crocker-Harris in the end of the 1951 version was better, although I can see why some people might prefer the 1994 version here. Secondly I felt the use of Mr. Crocker-Harris' translation of Agamemnon in the final scenes of the 1951 version was splendid.
The reasons I overall prefer the 1994 version are actually a lot of little things which I could not completely list even if I were not trying to avoid spoilers. But of the more notable reasons, first of all is the character of Andrew Crocker-Harris (the main character). There were advantages and disadvantages to both versions of Andrew, but I really preferred the 1994 version. I could see in this version that he was at one time probably a good teacher (although not necessary ever a great teacher), and despite the fact that he is currently only a shall of the man he probably once was, he is still respected by his peers although they perhaps also pity him, and he also has the respect of his former students who also clearly still fear him.
Secondly, I felt that the character of Taplow was far better in the 1994 version. It is not that I did not like Brian Smith's acting in the 1951 version, it is more the way the character is fleshed out in the 1994 version. I found this version of Taplow more likable, and more understandable.
A third point which helped the 1994 version was the extra scenes of the school life, instead of concentrating so much on Mr. and Mrs. Crocker-Harris. This also helped in fleshing out the character of Taplow.
One other notable thing. The 1951 version is not rated, the 1994 version is rated R. At the beginning of the 1994 movie it is stated that the R rating is ""for some language"". I did not count them, but I don't recall more than about a half dozen uses of profanity in the whole movie, plus a few more uses of words which although not profanity had sexual references. An R rating for this seems a but much. Even figuring in the brief shower scene where three boys (including Taplow) are seen fully nude from the rear I did not see how it would deserve an R rating, I would think it would be more of a PG-13. The 1951 version has neither the profanity, sexual language nor the nudity.",1402012800,3,3194,4.378787878787879
685469,5,6303585353,This is a beautiful movie played so well by talented  British actors. Among them Albert Finney and Julian Sands. Love it.,1388707200,2,121,4.761904761904762
685470,3,6303585353,"It must be said that Albert Finney's performance is first-rate--restrained, subtle, and yet powerfully moving. What an actor! But I should add that he has tough competition from Michael Redgrave playing the part of Crocker-Harris in the original black-and-white film of Rattigan's play. To my mind, Redgrave wins hands-down. In addition, the new technicolor version is less than satisfactory in many other respects. Most of the supporting actors are more forgettable in the roles (especially the boys) than their predecessors.  Michael Gabon is OK as the headmaster, but cannot compete in creepiness with Wilfred Hyde-White. Matthew Modine as the lover of ""Crock's"" wife is much too much of the Hollywood pretty boy. (I fail to see what is gained by the rescripting's making him an American. In fact, many of the rewriter's updates seem gratuitious and facile to me.) Only Greta Scacchi gives a performance that matches, or perhaps outdoes, Jean Kent's in the original version. All in all the older movie is more convincing and authentic.
And of course, both versions get something important across: that Terence Rattigan is a much underrated dramatist and deserves a rehearing. ""The Winslow Boy"" has already been refilmed and perhaps ""Separate Tables"" (remember Deborah Kerr and David Niven?) will also at last get another chance on both stage and screen.
One final remark about the Finney version. I watched it with closed captioning. Finney is a headmaster teaching Greek (the title refers to Robert Browning's translation of Aeschylus' Agamemnon), but every time he quotes ancient Greek in this movie, the subtitles say ""Speaking Latin"" and give no translation. To misquote Ezra Pound, the thought of what the modern world would come to ""if the classics had a wider circulation"" may well trouble our sleep . . .",1385596800,5,1815,5.173469387755102
685471,5,6303585353,"Mike Figgis does a fine job adapting Terence Rattigan's THE BROWNING VERSION to the screen.  His film does not compare with Anthony Asquith's memorable adaptation (1951), which has a tremendously powerful performance by Michael Redgrave, but it remains a very good effort nonetheless, and Albert Finney is totally in command in a role that demands great emotional control by an experienced performer.  The whole cast is excellent and the film benefits from beautiful location shooting in the southwest of England.  Definitely worth seeing.",1379462400,,539,5.469879518072289

685476,5,6303585353,"Having seen Terrence Rattigan's play performed live several times,as well as having seen the original 1951 film adaptation,director Mike Figgis has scored a real triumph with Greta Scacchi and Albert Finney in the roles of Laura and Andrew Crocker-Harris. The play itself is not IMO the most lively of stories,nor certainly the finest play yet written,but what Scacchi and Finney bring to the table as this terribly ill suited husband and wife is screen magic and their performances alone put this BROWNING VERSION at the very top. Andrew,a professor of Greek at an exclusive English Prep School has been anything but endearing over the years to his students. Obviously his younger and gorgeous wife,Laura,has enough baggage of her own to be a sexual minx with an American faculty member (Matthew Modine,who seems like...well...Matthew Modine-not a memorable performance).It is one student,Taplow (Ben Silverstone),who has been sincerely touched by his crochety professor, who , wise beyond his years,is the key to unlocking the long-ago closed heart of Andrew. But it is the outstanding performances of Finney against Scaachi that really set this film into gear. It is their relationship that director Figgis shows us in such gut-wrenching detail with long,reflective closeups. Figgis has chosen to allow the camera to dwell into the faces and souls of his characters,instead of pushing along the story. This is Figgis' decision and it works magnificently. You will be hard pressed to find a better piece of directing and acting when it comes to expressing the regrets and failures of a mismatched couple. This is a film of regret and resignation,not of a happy ending....hmmmn....like life sometimes,huh?",1174953600,9,1706,5.322222222222222
685477,5,6303585353,"If you love Albert Finney,  & Gretta Scacchi (as all humans in their right mind should of course), you will enjoy this movie. I saw another person here complaining about Albert Finney's performance, but I think it's wonderful, & he ""carries"" the film IMO. Gretta Scacchi......well, I would go watch her read the phone book, but this may not be her absolute best film performance--hard to say if that's the direction, or what, but she still does a great job at portraying the gorgeous (adulterous) wife of a repressed English School teacher.

The one ""Clinker"" here is Matthew Modine, IMO. He doesn't seem to have much range as an actor, & in scenes with Albert Finney & Gretta Scacchi, that is even more painfully apparent. Another Plus tho is Michael Gambon (who played LBJ in the HBO movie Path to War), as the Headmaster.

Highly recommended.",1157673600,3,845,4.773972602739726
685478,4,6303585353,"I had never seen the Redgrave movie and I watched this for Finney.  I never cried so hard, mainly for lost opportunities.  Yet, there was hope for Crocker-Harris at the end.  I would hope so.  His decision to part from his wife was his first step towards freedom.  My problem is that since it was updated to the nineties, why didn't they divorce?  She could have left him years before that, when divorce was acceptable.

And Matthew Modine.  Unfortunately, in too many British films and television series, the Americans are portrayed as loud mouth buffoons.  When Modine's character says he never heard of Aeschylus, I have to wonder about the anti-American attitudes that the Brits have for us.

And while I think Crocker Harris seemed cold, he did what a teacher should do: teach and try to open minds.  Today's youths want things ""easy"" and spoon fed.  Much easier to mock the teacher than actually think.

Scacci was perfect: brutal, uncaring, passionate and long suffering.  Too long suffering; I don't know why she didn't leave him long before.

Still, now I want to see the Redgrave version.  But Finney is remarkable here, as he always is.",1151884800,3,1147,4.775510204081633

The 1994 release is a very poor remake compared to the original classic and if you think Finney's film is great, then you have much to look forward to see the other picture.
Why oh why can't the Redgrave movie be converted to DVD?  Anyone out there know if such a CD is available or being planned for release?",1110326400,3,525,4.412371134020619
685524,4,6303585353,"Albert Finney's portrayal of retiring classics teacher, Andrew Crocker Harris, in ""The Browning Version"" is a marvelous and understated performance that you will not forget. While I rarely review movies on this site and I cannot fathom why  I missed this film when it was released in 1994, I recommend that everyone see it.  The title refers to a translation of Aeschylus' Agamemnon; a play that many students will recall from high school.  A play that resounds within this story too.
Crocker Harris is mocked and ridiculed by the students as a classics teacher of Latin and Greek. His popularity pales when compared to a physical education teacher who is also departing the school. His position at the prestigious English boarding school is being eliminated for one that emphasizes the study of modern languages. His wife is unfaithful with Matthew Modine's character, an American chemistry teacher.  The students often cite Crocker Harris' refrain about grading  "" You have obtained exactly what you deserve- no less and certainly no more.""  A line that unfortunately also describes Crocker Harris' teaching career and life.

The key scene where the boy, Taplow gave Andrew Crocker-Harris (Finney) the gift of the book was actually a great improvement compared to the original. Thought provoking, truly 1st class acting & totally enjoyable. Well done Mike Figgis- another excellent example of skillful direction.

685527,4,6303585353,"Albert Finney is the most compelling reason for watching this adaption of Terence Rattigan's stage play. His performance is moving as a classics teacher in a British public school, despised by his pupils and rejected by his unfaithful wife. He plays the role of Andrew Crocker-Harris with real pathos. In particular, the scene in which the young Taplow gives him a book (the Browning version of the title) as a parting gift after he is forced into early retirement, is an incredible moment, the force of which makes Harris' wife's subsequent cruelty all the more hard-hitting. For all his self-confessed flaws, Harris emerges (thanks to Finney, who rarely disappoints) as a genuinely sympathetic character whom the viewer can come to identify with, much as young Taplow came to identify with this tragic character.
I am not familiar with Rattigan's original stage play, so I am not in a place to make comparisons. The 'Figgis version' certainly did it for me. The beautiful location filming, the score, and the excellent supporting cast are all worthy of recommendation. Overall, the film is executed without fanfare or overstatement, relying on an affecting story told persuasively by a superb ensemble of actors.",1014163200,18,1214,5.136363636363637

685529,2,6303585353,"Terrence Rattigan's play centres on Andrew Crocker-Harris who is resigning as classics professor from an English boy's school, and is structured as an extended farewell. This kind of play requires a great central performance which, in this version, Albert Finney does not give. Granted, Rattigan is no major dramatist and there is little enough opportunity in the text for any actor, but Finney fails to reach the audience. Finney's acting recalls his sober moments in John Huston's Under the Volcano. He looks pasty and the only pleasure to be had is in his mercurial voice and counting the lines in his face. Watching him, one wonders what delicacy Anthony Hopkins would have brought to the role and longs to see Michael Redgrave in the 1951 version, who by all accounts was superb. As Finney's wife, Greta Scacchi is the best reason to see the film. She looks lovely and brings the pathos that Finney lacks to her role. When she visits Matthew Modine, the science teacher at the school who she has been having an affair with, and he rejects her, we see her longing and disappointment. She also has a deliciously nasty moment later when she insults Finney and, in an inspired touch, director Mike Figgis frames her face with exploding fireworks. Modine seems too young for his role and is stiff and unconvincing. It's hard to believe that Scacchi would fall in love with him. As the young boy who Finney has been tutoring and who gives him ""the Browning version"", Ben Silverstone is sensitive and looks a little like Geraldine Chaplin. In the school shower room, Figgis comes through with another visual masterstroke by framing the boy's shivering wet body with the taunting face of his tormentor. The film manages to shake off Rattigan's stuffiness and make theatrical material cinematic only occasionally. Because of his reliance on Finney, Figgis' direction seems weak at pivotal moments. When the boys are meant to marvel at Finney's Latin performance of Aeschylus, Figgis' camera shoves Finney in our face. When Finney receives the book whose inscription causes him to break down, Figgis never shows us what the boy had written, and in the climactic speech he cuts madly away from Finney to the weeping onlookers. The school itself is as big as a castle, but we only get to see glimpses of it. Of note is Mark Isham's moving music.",992995200,9,2338,4.862155388471178
685530,4,6303585353,"This movie deserves a just review, if only to debunk the notion that the film bears any resemblance to the 'The Dead Poets Society.'  It is a uniquely English work that illustrates what it is to keep a stiff upper lip -- after a fair amount of quivering.
Albert Finney is masterful as Andrew Crocker-Harris, the stern and unyielding teacher of classics who has, rather suddenly, found himself at the end of his career.  With modernity regnant in society, Crocker-Harris faces students uninterested in the great literary works of antiquity and a successor who intends to abolish the tenets of a curriculum that once produced the most learned citizens of any nation.  Crocker-Harris can clearly see that his time is passing.  But unlike 'Dead Poets,' which sends the unacceptable message that suicide offers an exit from seemingly intractable problems, 'The Browning Version' finds its main character clinging to hope in the face of despair.  The vehicle by which this occurs is a student's kind gesture.
There are several excellent moments in this film, but perhaps the finest was a scene in which Crocker-Harris -- teaching his final class in the Classics -- attempts to convey depth and feeling in translating Aeshylus' Agamemnon.  It's hard not to get caught up in it.  For the first time, the staid old teacher conjures up meaning from across the ages in a work that, for the students, is only a dusty tome better kept on a library shelf.
My chief complaint about this film centers on development:  it needed more character development and a more studied consideration of the literary content, to which only allusions are given.
As the French would say, 'The Browning Version' is a voir-absolument.",985132800,8,1701,4.964788732394366

I  now see where  Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf got it's theme; this is the more realistic  version of the Albee play.  You can feel the emotions Finney feels as he  comes to the end of a failed teaching career and marriage: the subleties of  sadness, anger, and ultimate emotional triumph.

Strict but sincere Albert Finney teaches ancient languages to his, all boys, classes. Overlooked by the headmaster for the position, he rightfully should have been given, he decides to retire but the school board denies his pension & tension raises between he & his wife. Unrealized by Finney a boy in his class has been moved by what he has learned from his teacher & buys him a parting gift of the book ""Agamemnon"" that was translated from Greek into English by Robert Browning. Hence the title of the movie ""The Browning version"". Finney is noticeably moved by this gesture from the boy to the point of tears, but again his wife accuses the boy of doing this for ulterior motives. The movie's final scenes are when the school is meeting in the auditorium for the last time before breaking for the end of the school term, & Finney bucks the wishes of the headmaster & insists on his right as senior master to make the last speech. His speech turns out not to be what he had in mind but he speaks from his heart to the cheers & applause of both the boys & the faculty. In the last scene the boy that gave Finney the gift approaches him to say goodbye & Finney answers him in ancient Greek informing him that he will be going into the science class next term, something he wanted but needed Finney's approval to be able to go into that class. The movie is full of emotion from excellent performances by all the actors & to my thinking has a lot of good moral despite of the obvious infidelity by Scacchi.",1515196800,,1765,4.384146341463414

7850848,5,6303585353,"I am glad I didn't miss out on this. No movie I've seen in some years has moved me as deeply.

A plot summary is not going to do this justice. (Neither does the cover/poster. It doesn't do the movie any favors and I found it off putting. Don't judge something by it's cover I guess.) It's not an action packed thing per se. Instead, you get a deeply felt, affecting look into the lives of a few people at an upper class English school. They feel like real people.

The performances are all very good, but Albert Finney gave the most incredible job, amazing, absolutely shattering.

This is the kind of movie *they don't make anymore*. Or not often enough. A serious movie that doesn't hit you over the head with noise and absurdity.

Like I said, very glad I watched it.",1477699200,5,770,4.363636363636363

7850852,3,6303585353,"Old fashioned teacher who loved the subject he taught and expected his students to equally love it, if not just while they were in his class, gets shoved out of the school and robbed of a pension. His wife is having an affaire with another teacher. The students mock him. The guy keeps his head up and doesn't waiver.

I gave this 3 stars. But I was tempted to give it 1 star. At first the movie shows how decent people get through life even with they get knocked around--you stay true to what is right. But then for whatever reason the hero succumbs to the pressures and whimpering and sobbing asks ""for forgiveness"" of his students for being too hard and robbing them of the pleasure of learning--their ""right"". It was basically the real world battle in education between money/politics/sports and education on the screen. And just like in real life American education (even though this was set in England) sports/money/politics wins. How sad. It is Hollywood. Lets pretend that the the right side won for a change.

You see a lot of well known people in this movie. Albert Finney Matthew Modine Maryam d'Abo Greta Scacchi Beautiful boys' school campus of course.",1467244800,,1165,4.705882352941177
