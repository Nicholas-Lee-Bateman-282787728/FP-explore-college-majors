8319893,3,B001LVJCEW,"OK, the good news first. It's a two movie combo. I wanted to re-watch thin red line, so getting platoon was a huge plus. The bad is, I had forgotten how disappointed I was with the thin red line,  but I sure remember now! Beach Red is a greatly superior movie, probably why Malick ripped off so much of it in the thin red line.",1468454400,,327,4.030769230769231
8319894,5,B001LVJCEW,"Both of these movies are jaw dropping. ""Platoon"" was quite a bit more edgey and R-rated while ""The Thin Red Line"" was more artistic. Nonetheless, an awesome buy!",1275868800,2,161,4.785714285714286
