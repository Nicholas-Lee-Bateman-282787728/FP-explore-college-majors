8409295,5,B003YBHYCO,"So I saw JA in denver and will never be the same.  Probably the tightest, funkiest band I have ever seen live.

The DVD is a very useful resource.  Stephen's drumming is actually somewhat straightforward, just mightily accomplished.
There are transcriptions of the basic song grooves and cadence as well as transcriptions for the entire songs.  There are also play along mp3 files that have a bass groove.
I expect to get a ton of milage from this resource.  The DVD gives me everything I need, the rest is up to me.

The only weakness: I would have loved to have a few live JA clips in the special features.  Oh well.",1339113600,,618,4.464285714285714
