I liked the Advanced Fighting Techniques and Workout tape the best -- which is the real reason I bought these tapes anyway.  This workout has you perform some basic martial arts movements (jab, cross, front kick, side kick, etc.) against a heavy bag for 32 minutes.  Its a real killer workout.  Lenny Magill is the same age I am and is in really great shape which is his own testament as to the effectiveness of this workout.  The downside to these tapes is that they are a bit disjointed in places -- and he should have spent a little longer on martial arts basics for those who don't know the proper way to throw a front kick, side kick, knee, jab, whatever.  All in all though, I'd recommend this set for the Advanced Fighting Workout alone.",1036022400,3,841,4.393548387096774
