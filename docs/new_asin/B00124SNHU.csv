3076365,3,B00124SNHU,"This is an early example of pink film from Japan. It's not as explicit as roman porno films of the 1970s; however, it has charm.  There are some nice artsy cinematic moments during love scenes, closeups of the body, sweat, lakes and some posturing. Where the film falters is the pretty weak dialog, the character who plays the maid (who is pretty inconsequential to the story), and the poorly remastered print.  The 35mm print has a lot of blemishes and the original subtitles are used (white on the print itself).  If you are familiar with some of the Something Weird re-issues of  black and white art house films, you may like this.  If you are expecting an all out exploitation flick, you may be disappointed.",1236211200,6,712,4.664
3076366,3,B00124SNHU,"The first thing that jumped out to me about this movie is that it's an old black & white movie, if I had known that ahead of time, I would never have purchased this movie.  If you are looking for something racey and like watching nude asian women, then this isn't the movie for you.  If this movie were to be released today it would probably be rated PG.  If you like old movies (like movies with Humphry Bogart) then this might be the movie for you.",1219795200,6,450,4.149425287356322

8243772,5,B00124SNHU,"Far better than its English title, Slave Widow, or its clichd scenario, old fellow gets younger woman, would suggest. Indeed this early b/w outing from Mr Watanabe is fairly lyrical and quite beautiful at times. The mood is much helped by the mellow, classical soundtrack but also by the remarkable camera-work. Partly, of course, much has to be done to avoid the sex scenes being too explicit but here the ingenious use of intense close-up or focus upon silken sheets and clothing do much to make for some surprisingly erotic moments. Featuring Naomi Tani in an early role and her body seems not to have yet developed in anything like the way that she would later be displayed within ropes in the 70s. Here, Noriko Tatsumi is the splendid and voluptuous lead and around whom the movie revolves. Interesting shifts of power in this one.",1523145600,,836,4.772413793103448

8243779,4,B00124SNHU,"Noriko Tatsumi gives a strong performance as the ""slave widow"". But once again, it's Naomi Tani that steals the show, whenever she appears on screen, in this minor role, early in her career. Mamoru Watanabe is considered one of the best pink directors. There are only 4 sixties pink films available. The transfer could be better.",1399161600,4,329,4.892857142857143
8243780,4,B00124SNHU,"A dark film-noir type film.  The actress is sultry and the film has a very sexy feel, the way it is filmed, as much as the male-female situations.  It is not necessarily a happy topic, tho, as you will see from the summary above.  There was something really attractive about the film, not just the sexuality, but the way the story was unfolded and how you were kept interested.  This movie is nothing like hk film, but if you have ever seen those, you will know-- low production values, rushed schedules,  making a million movies a year, but yet, perhaps partly because of the practice everyone was getting, there were some real gems among them.

In the same way, though this is probably in the sexploitation genre, some of the cinematography, some of the direction, some of the acting really shines.

It is not like one of my favorite films of all time, but for what it is, it gets 4-5 stars as a genre thing that came out well.",1377216000,2,929,4.429411764705883
8243781,3,B00124SNHU,"Altogether plausable situation in which a recent widow is approached by her late husband's major creditor with an offer to exchange indebtedness for sex.  Women apparently bore some kind of legal responsibility for their husbands debts, which is terrible.  Although it sounds outrageous I suspect that things like this happen all the time, even here in the United States.  There is some pretty tame sex in the movie, not quite up to an R rating.  I found myself feeling sorry for the woman.  On the other hand she did not seem to be entirely rejecting the arrangement, either.  If he would have married her I think she would have gone along, but no such luck. He plans to marry someone else but keep her around for sex. Bad ending.  This was apparently the kind of movie that excited Japanese in the 1960's. Damned if I can see why. Other than the novelty of a different culture and customs, I wasn't too impressed.",1287619200,8,915,4.611111111111111
