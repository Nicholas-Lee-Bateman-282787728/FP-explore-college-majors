2630915,1,B000H877IS,"Unfortunately, the disc I was sent was not playable due to some kind of compiling error in its creation. I'm a bit of a video freak and know my way around dvd file structures, vob files, etc; but this one just was not able to play. The seller was quite accomodating in processing a refund immediately, which I very much appreciate. The disc, itself, looked like someone made it on the cheap on a computer from 1995 with a low quality black and white printed paper dvd label. (when I make my dvd's, especially for people I sell to, I prefer either glossy or matte finish) There are, as I understand, high quality discs for this movie mix out there, and this was only my first attempt to obtain one. So, I'll keep looking, and keep positive if you're looking for one, they're out there.",1273104000,11,784,4.413793103448276
2630916,5,B000H877IS,I'm so tired of having to sync this up on my own.  It's amazing to have an already done for me version that I can share and watch over and over and over and over again.... YAY!!!!  How can you go wrong with Pink Floyd and the Wizard of Oz all on one DVD?!!  Thank you....,1266537600,,271,3.8035714285714284
2630917,1,B000H877IS,"Just received Dark Side of Oz which is a CD copy of Dark Side of the Moon and a VHS of Wizard OZ.

The ad appeared to sell a synched DVD that contains sound of DSOTM with the Wizard of OZ movie, IT DOES NOT.

The fine print at the end of the ad states ""box set"" for Pink Floyd CD and Wizard of OZ movie.  WTF.

Amazon get rid of these flying monkees please.

Be well,  Chris",1260403200,35,374,3.730769230769231
2630918,4,B000H877IS,"Came quickly and in good condition - it is for a Christmas gift, so I haven't watched yet to check for viewing quality.  Don't expect any problems though!",1257033600,3,154,4.5
2630919,5,B000H877IS,"I saw this originally on AMC TV, and was thrilled when I stumbled upon this on Amazon. To all the Pink Floyd fans, I know you'll enjoy this sync dvd ...",1371772800,2,152,3.935483870967742
2630920,5,B000H877IS,"I really enjoy this movie, especially the perk of not having to run around getting things in sync. Have watched it multiple times since I purchased it. I wish I would have had this in college.

Thank you.",1369526400,2,204,4.368421052631579
2630921,1,B000H877IS,There is a certain time the music is supposed to begin so that it will sync w the movie. Clearly the maker of this movie wasn't aware of it because each time the cd began again it became more and more off. By the end of the movie it was so far off it was redicilous. Completely wasted my money. Do NOT buy this version. There is a certain care that should go into making it that was sorely lacking here.,1366848000,,403,3.9876543209876543
2630922,5,B000H877IS,"Well synchronized. Sound and picture were clear, product arrived on time and in Preston's condition.  I do not regret ordering this at all.",1364601600,3,139,5.043478260869565
2630923,3,B000H877IS,"It's good, but off by a few seconds. Worth having, but it looks better when you hear the beginning of money when Dorothy starts to open the door, not after the door is open. Perhaps having the starting music from the movie throws it off.",1364342400,,237,4.288888888888889
2630924,4,B000H877IS,"I received my version of The Dark Side of OZ from
Cabin Creek.  Video and sound are of excellent quality.
The timing is perfect, the price very reasonable, lightning
fast shipping.  I highly recommend this version of The
Dark Side of OZ and I highly recommend Cabin Creek.",1364083200,,272,4.645833333333333
2630925,1,B000H877IS,"I thought this was going to be an officially-released version of WoZ with Dark Side.  Instead, what I got looks like some clown put it together in his bedroom.

The Cover Sheet was obviously created by a home PC and printer, with poor-quality, pixelated graphics - it looks like he just swiped a jpg from the web, fiddled with it in Microsoft Paint, and tried to blow it up.

The disc was a DVD-R from best buy, with another poor-quality, print-out image stickered to it.  The video quality was poor, as was the audio.  The picture would continually freeze up, and the yahoo that made it didn't even have the music and video synced up to the right point!

Amazon must be getting a cut from this obvious video piracy, otherwise I don't see why this is still here.  Why no one has been sued yet over multiple copywrite violations, is utterly beyond me.",1360195200,12,850,4.48051948051948
2630926,1,B000H877IS,"The Cover was a low res colour copy.
TheDVD was a blank, in a thin case, not a proper 10mm or so case- it doesn't sit well in my library.
It goes, yes.
But I could have made this myself.
From the looks of this product, I doubt the makers were paid their royalty fee, which as a film maker myself, bugs me greatly.",1359504000,,313,3.90625

2630928,2,B000H877IS,"I actually sell this on ebay almost exclusively, along with all the other Pink Floyd Syncs, others? YES others! If you're looking at this you should see what i have to offer. I send you a synced dvd, no cd + vhs do it your self combo and my price is fair and low with 100's of positive feedback. I happen to use the same image as you see here but offer more for less. Check it out on ebay!",1322524800,2,389,3.875

8137517,3,B000H877IS,I havnt watched this version but I have done the synching myself and I'm convienced that it was done on purpose. I just can't believe though that no one else but me has also tried the next album right after the dark side is over. Its freakin' Amazing!,1438905600,,251,4.25

8137520,5,B000H877IS,I was a little apprehensive with this purchase because of the mixed reviews. My Dad is a huge Pink Floyd fan and loves the Dark Side of the Rainbow so it would be very easy for him to tell if the movie would be off sync with music. We were both very impressed with the visual and audio quality of the DVD. The music is synced perfectly to the movie. It was the the perfect Christmas present!,1419897600,,391,4.090909090909091
