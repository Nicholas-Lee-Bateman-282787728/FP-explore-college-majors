8439179,1,B004RQDTLA,"This blu ray is actually a Best Buy exclusive and the transfer is horrendous. If you have the DVD, don't bother with this blu ray version as the picture quality for the DVD is way better. Not that the picture quality for the DVD is great but all the blu ray did was just put the DVD transfer to blu ray without cleaning it up so you'll see all the flaws are now way more pronounced than when they're on the DVD. Audio quality is better but that's to be expected but because of the picture quality of the blu ray I couldn't even watch it. I also have She's the One, also an exclusive, which I bought months ago and the picture is great and super clean so I don't know what happened to The Brothers McMullen. Movie itself is 5 stars and also one of my favorite films along with She's the One. However, because of it being on blu ray and how it looks, I can't give it anything but 1 star as it's just laziness not to clean up the picture. With classics such as Star Wars, Back to the Future and Superman all looking great on blu there's absolutely no excuse for this release. Glad I kept my DVD copy as it's the better version. Can't say the same for She's the One as the blu ray edition is the version to get. Actually had to drive out of my way to BB just to buy this blu ray today which makes it a worse experience as I had to use gas and time for this inferior copy. Paying full price for it didn't help either. Maybe the Amazon / regular version will have better picture but as far as I know, this is a BB exclusive and can only be bought from them.",1344816000,6,1551,4.022653721682848
