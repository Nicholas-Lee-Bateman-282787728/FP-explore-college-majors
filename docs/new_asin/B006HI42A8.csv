8498544,5,B006HI42A8,"John Miller really explains the different positions and tunings used in the country blues and helps you learn how to approach transcribing a piece by ear. He explains the tricks and sounds of the country blues so well, it will benefit anyone who intends to include the Piedmont, Delta, or other 1920s-30s blues, as a major part of their repertoire -- even if they never intend to transcribe anything on their own. I wish I'd had this 4 or 5 years ago -- but it was still a great way to help me clarify and consolidate my own thoughts and ideas on the genre of music I love. Excellent.

I've never been disappointed with any of John Miller's videos and I own most of the DVDs that he has released.",1386115200,,696,4.3538461538461535
8498545,5,B006HI42A8,"A discerning musical ear,.is a teachable skill and Mr. Miller is your teacher. What a great lesson! If you are a blues enthusiast and want to learn songs off recorded tracks, this is the ticket. John will teach you how to recognize sounds that are specific to certain positions....I just got the lessons and in one evening I can now distinguish the characteristics of all the key positions in standard tuning. I am anxious to start on the altered tuning lessons.",1369008000,3,462,4.716049382716049
8498546,5,B006HI42A8,"OK first, I am not THAT John Miller, nor a relative.  Just a guitarist learning old-time blues fingerpicking.  This is a fantastic DVD in many ways.  For one thing, John is a clear and patient teacher who explains things well and whose love of the music comes through clearly.  For another, this lesson really does succeed in teaching you how to recognize the key, and most importantly the left-hand position, of songs just by listening, and without depending on any ability you may or may not have to recognize the pitch of the notes (something I for one can't do).  With this skill in place, it is possible to listen to a recording of an old blues song and start to figure out how to play it without the aid of tablature or a teacher.  Yet another great benefit of this lesson is that John plays lots of examples in each key as he teaches his ear-training method, and he plays them slowly enough, with great shots of his hands (especially the left one, which is most important).  For anyone who has been fingerpicking in this style even at an advanced beginner level (which is about where I would put myself), this gives you a big leg up on learning a whole wealth of material, from songs to licks you can work into your own arrangements (or just messing around--I spent a bunch of time in drop-D just playing around improvising based on some of the licks John plays here).  There is no tablature for these song excerpts, but that's what's fun and challenging about this dvd.  There are lots of great dvd lessons out there, some by John himself, which work to teach songs phrase by phrase along with tablature.  This dvd is more like a how-to manual so you can learn to do it yourself.",1329177600,5,1687,4.465798045602606
