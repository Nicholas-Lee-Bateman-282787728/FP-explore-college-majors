6471618,5,B00L5R5GE2,"We seen this movie in May, in a movie theater, along with six other documentaries about nutrition while we were visiting my sister (who's a health nut) in San Diego for a week. My husband and I decided after learning what we did that we were also FED UP. We decided to eat like vegans for one month. Our results were so exciting that we decided to continue with almost all organic veggies, fruit, beans, nuts, seeds, tofu and whole grains. I started on May 23 2014 wearing a TIGHT size 12 pants, large or extra large shirts, and weighing in at 159 pounds. Oh and I'm only 4'11"". As I sit here today 08/20/2014, just shy of three months, I'm obviously still 4'11"" but I'm in a size 8 pants, wearing a small shirt, and weighting in at 127.5 pounds and still counting down. That's an average of 11 pounds lost a month. Did I mention that I have NOT been exercising, but I plan to start because I want to tighten it up. Wow being a health nut is not so nuts!

Buy the movie, show it to family and friends (who are willing to watch it), and change their lives like my sister did ours. Great Movie!

Just in case you were wondering the other documentaries we seen were: Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead; Forks Over Knives; Hungry for Change; Food Matters; Vegucated; and The Beautiful Truth.",1408492800,567,1278,4.320833333333334

6471620,5,B00L5R5GE2,"After missing its short run in selected theaters, Im thankful for the opportunity to have reviewed this movie at the TCFF (Traverse City Film Festival). Fed Up sets just the right tone with an underlying functional medicine approach to health without overwhelming the viewer.  Having said this, some might consider the absence of detailed research references the movie's flaw.  But make no mistake-there exists a great many evidence based studies which support the conclusions purported by the various speakers.  Visualizing the actual struggles people are experiencing to lose weight and ""eat healthy"" on a very basic level will serve as a much more effective tool to educate and motivate REAL lifestyle changes and buying habits.  This movie (like few others) has the guts to ""name names"" and be specific about many, if not all the aspects of our current disasterous ""information-product-advertising-programming"" infrastructure fueled by corporations, our ""disease-management""health care system, family/parent dynamics, cultural influences, etc).  Fed up accurately highlights the multiple contributory factors which directly interfere with getting to the truth about our health care epidemic (its NOT just about HFCC!).  I have prepurchased the DVD and plan to show this to my patients as part of our educational programming.",1406937600,102,1328,5.648241206030151

Some documentaries certainly can help in guiding an individual in a good direction with exposing some facts about nutrition and diet.

This documentary will not teach you how to read Nutrition Facts or Ingredients or how to read the nutrients in your blood analysis but it will guide you about the marketing used in the food industry which is a good start.

6471628,5,B00L5R5GE2,"This is a fantastic film. My family and I have been ketogenic (high fat, low carb, no sugar, no grain, etc.) for almost a year, and this film was a great jump start into getting the rest of my household on board with me when I started researching the lifestyle. It does a great job of showing the progression of our nation's mainstream nutrition in its downward spiral to its current, sugar-filled state, and tying that in to the decline of our health as a society overall. I will be the first to say that I am not a fan of Bill Clinton, but as a public school teacher, I have mad respect for his voice in regard to nutrition in our cafeterias. Don't let his name on the credit list put you off the film if you are not a fan, please. This is well worth watching, and I have shown segments of it to my elementary health students when we were learning about sugar in their diets and the role it plays in health decline. I have passed the video on to countless people in my life...family, friends, followers of my blog, and the list goes on.

And the food industry looked to the tobacco industry for strategies for convincing people their product was not harmful.  Shameful!  I almost (but not quite) took to activism after seeing the movie.  Made me so angry!  What greed and lack of caring for people.  Let's just ruin some children's lives by making them addicted to sugar and therefore obese.

I learned recently don't know if it was in Fed Up or something else I watched but they have 53 different names for sugar.

6471650,3,B00L5R5GE2,"Sugar, who doesnt love it! However, this love has caused our country to become the most obese country in the world. Unfortunately, the most affected group of people at risk for obesity is children. A parents job is to protect their child, then why are all of these children becoming obese.
 Fed Up was distributed by RADiUS-TWC in 2014. The production company was Atlas Films. Stephanie Soechtig directed the documentary. She also co-produced it with Laurie David, Katie Couric, Sarah Olson, Eve Marson, Kristin Lazure and Sarah Gibson. Soechtig also, co-wrote the documentary with Mark Monroe. The whole documentary was narrated by Katie Couric. It is 92 minutes long. Fed Up discusses the childhood obesity caused by all of the sugar found in our society.
 This documentary interviewed several families that have obese children. These children were all around the age of 13 some younger, some older. It discusses the first dietary guidelines produced in the United States. These guidelines did not include sugar. Since there was no limit to the amount of sugar that is put into food, the amount of sugar used into our society has dramatically increased.  With this increase in sugar, the mount of childhood obesity and diabetes has increased as well. The documentary than continues to describe the policies that are supposed to help the children in our society. However, states were able to get around the laws passed. In fact, one state provided that pizza was a vegetable, don't get me wrong I love pizza but it is not a vegetable. They went over First Lady, Michelle Obamas health plan. Which really consists of children getting out and exercising. You can exercise all you want but if you are still eating sugar than that exercise is not going to help you. Childhood obesity is too high and watching this documentary shades a little bit of light into why childhood obesity is rising.
 At the conclusion of the documentary it provided a list of organizations and people who repeatedly declined to talk to Fed Up. One person who declined was First Lady Michelle Obama. This was shocking to me. She is so passionate about, children being healthy, yet she wouldnt talk about it. She fought for bills to be passed, so why won't she talk about the problem in American. She was just one person that declined, but if the First Lady, doesnt want to talk about the problem that is going on the United States, then who will.
 I would recommend this documentary for parents and teenagers. I liked that it informed the viewers about the problems that are going on in our society. I liked that they interviewed real families. They provided perspective. These people are living the reality that this documentary is trying to prevent. Finally, I liked that they should how many people and companies declined to interview. This children are our future, shouldnt we be trying to protect them. Well, all this sugar is going to make our lives shorter and harder.",1483315200,,2948,4.864541832669323

This should be a must watch for every family in all parts of the country because of the traditions of the families eating habits.  Fast food this and fried food that. The lie about sugar substitutes and their safety which is another matter. The politicians keep proving over and over that it wants to keep the people uneducated, unhealthy and it was proven with the past election. Decisions are made with the almighty dollar as compared to safety.

The food industry and U.S. government are partnered hand in hand to bring you various kinds of sicknesses; and that, my friends, is intolerable.

The quickest way to make a difference is to stop purchasing products that contain sugar in it's many forms (besides fiber rich fruits and vegetables), and educate those around you about the evils of the food industry and the grotesque nature of sugar. Again, point people to the documentary ""Fed Up"", and watch it yourselves to receive a massive, eye-opening download of truth.

6471708,5,B00L5R5GE2,"The movie starts out addressing our countrys current solution to the epidemic, which is all the new healthy food options in our grocery stores. It informs us that over the last 40 years, the amount of overweight Americans has also doubled, which leads her to ask are our solutions actually solutions? It then goes on to discuss that unlike what the food industry wants us to believe, not all calories are the same, meaning that a calorie from soda, for example, is not the same as a calorie from an almond. Fed Up does an incredible job at appealing to the viewers emotions as well when they follow the daily lives of four young overweight teens.
While I would say Fed Up was great, it did not go without its flaws. One thing that bothered me about the film was that at the end of filming the overweight teens, they did not correct their misinformed ideas, which gave me the impression that they would never be able to accomplish their goal. In addition, the movie does not offer a true solution beyond personal change.
Overall, I would strongly recommend this documentary to anyone. The information that is provided in Fed Up could be helpful to anyone because even if obesity doesnt affect you directly, it has affected the people around us and the more educated we are on the truth of the causes, the more likely we are able to fix the problem.",1458864000,,1347,4.5473251028806585

6471732,5,B00L5R5GE2,"I thought I knew a fair amount about healthy eating until I saw this documentary. I've always had reservations about how our food is processed and labeled but tended to focus my blame on the producer side of the process. After watching this, I'm convinced that our government is complicit (at best) in deceiving the public about the food in grocery stores and (more likely) deliberately lying to consumers and colluding with food producers to do so.

This truly has changed the food I buy and the way I eat. I believe I have a better understanding of what to look out for (almost everything in grocery stores!) and what foods will promote a healthy lifestyle. I am disgusted that the US government (and even international organizations such as the World Health Organization) have been 'bought off' by food producers and lobbying organizations. Even more despicable is what the US is doing to school children by allowing foods they know are unhealthy that will lead to serious long-term health consequences to be served in schools across the country.

If you want to know the truth about the food produced and consumed in the US, I strongly encourage watching this documentary. No individual or entity is spared from exposure of their role in, what I believe is, the greatest (and most harmful) deceit perpetuated against the American public. There is a reason that experts predict that over 90% of Americans will be obese by 2050. This video explains why. It should be required viewing starting in elementary schools and through middle and high schools and every consumer who purchases processed food should be provided with a copy of this video.

I thought perhaps people were exaggerating when I read reviews saying this documentary is life changing. After watching it (some parts more than once), I'd have to agree with that assessment.",1451952000,5,1839,4.925806451612903

Knowledge with activism is how things get changed and I hope when Mrs. Obama is out from under the lobbyists, she will bring back her fight against childhood obesity to the level that actually becomes effective. This should be shown in every hospital, PTA meeting, schools, colleges and so on. In my opinion, this shows that the obesity issue is like global warming, our future children, now adults are going to be like, ""how could it not have been the major issue that needed your activism when I was growing up?""",1443398400,,795,4.685714285714286

That you're not as good as the thin people? WEll this documentary proves that NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. This is well-done - starts with the problem, analyzes, figures out solutions. I do wish they'd included information on how to break a sugar cravings (I did it with L-glutamine supplements, took a month, re-lapsed, taking them again.)

6471801,5,B00L5R5GE2,"This documentary tackles some tough and unpopular realities with moving case studies, great insights, and fantastic graphics and animations. I read and watch a tremendous amount related to food, and without exaggeration, these were some of the best I've seen. Simple and to the point, but powerful!

The case studies are heart breaking, but excellent portrayals of exactly where so many Americans stand in terms of the struggles, the misinformation, and the (perceived) lack of options. I thought the documentary did a good job of touching on a wide variety of inter-related issues, and I was pleased to see both mainstays on the topic (Dr. Marion Nestle) and plenty of new faces providing valuable insights.

Kudos to the producers for taking on the ""eat less, exercise more"" mantra. Though I confess that although they thoroughly debunked that myth, I'd have loved to have also seen at least a passing reference to the many, many other complicating health factors that can further invalidate that idea, simply because so many people don't have the slightest idea.

I think this documentary is required viewing for all, especially those struglling with weight gain, but even for those who aren't, because this is one of the few things telling us the truth, no matter how hard the big corporations fight to prevent the government from revealing the truth.  We have a right to know what's in our foods, and the effects of these added ingredients.  One reviewer made a great point of us ""Americans don't like to be told what to do"" however, some of us have to be.  On the other hand, many in our society are completely unaware what has been forced down out throats for years, and now they are addicted to these ""added ingredients"" which continues to make these large corporations more and more wealthy.  For many years I once viewed these obese people as ""fat, lazy, and not making an effort"" when in all actuality, it's not entirely their fault.  They are victims....  This documentary truly enlightened me.

One doctor in this documentary couldn't even finish his thought because clearly he knows the truth but was supposed to follow a certain ""script"" which he forgot.

6471847,1,B00L5R5GE2,"Most of us don't need a movie to know that consuming too much sugar and processed foods will lead to obesity. It is our job to make the right food choices and guide our own children to do the same.  In 1945, Harry S. Truman signed the Bill into law, and school lunches now costs taxpayers about $9 Billion Dollars a year.

It is not the roll of Government to supervise what, or how much we or our children consume.  If you decided to pop out kids like Pez, then it's you the parent that should be responsible for what they eat.

Now for the propaganda. The makers of this movie, Stephanie Soechtig and Katie Couric are Liberals and have to be called out on this. There are scenes in this movie that outright praise Michele Obama as do most media outlets, while there are subtle out of context scenes bashing Ronald Reagan,George Bush, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Malkin to name a few, for wanting Government out of our lives.

6471873,4,B00L5R5GE2,"While blatantly stacked against Coca-Cola and many fast food businesses, this documentary does make some very solid points about the dangers of bleached and/or processed sugars & carbs.  While all sugars are calories, the importance of fiber in regulating the release of these sugars is emphasized by several experts.  More importantly, the myth that fat people are just not motivated enough to work off those extra pounds is exposed.  Furthermore, there are other myths about weight gain and health that the food industry tends to propagate, but are actually counter-productive towards holistic nutrition.  For instance, I doubt I will ever buy another ""Reduced Fat"" product again.  They all seem to add sugar to make up for the flavor they've robbed by processing something to be ""Low Fat.""  While some have found the documentary to be too long, it is filled with many interesting points about our current national state of nutrition.  It works as a companion piece to other food documentaries like ""Food, Inc.""

For an alternative take to Fed Up on this same issue, consider viewing the 2010 season of ""Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t,"" the ""Fast Food"" [season 8; episode #2].  While Penn Jillettes potty mouth may be too much for some to take, the pair do make many resonate points about the elitism inherent in some people's approach to this issue.  Unfortunately, ""Fed Up"" may have better science, but the arrogance associated with tone leave it open for criticism.  In particular, the idea that the American people would subsidize the corn growers (so they can have cheap feed & HFCS) and then tax themselves every time they purchased a corn-sweetened drink seems particularly absurd and at crossed purposes.  Amazon Prime members have access to this episode included with their Prime membership.

Interestingly enough, one of the small featurettes on the DVD (that's not streaming--as far as I know), shows how non-dairy creamer can claim to have ""No Trans-Fats"" on the label; however, the product is primarily water and hydrogenated soybean oil (100% trans-fat) with sugar.  It took me a few years to figure that trick out on my own: the serving size is so small that the producing company can legally say that the product has ""No Trans-Fats"" even though it is loaded with the stuff.  The stuff, BTW, causes cell walls/membranes to become brittle and fail.  It's as though drinking or eating the stuff will actually make you weak.  That's true: Oreos (and other creamy products with hydrogenated oils) will make you weaker and make it harder to recover from injury or illness.",1426464000,13,2577,5.011737089201878
6471874,3,B00L5R5GE2,"Honestly, if you've never watched any of the ""food"" movies before (like Food, Inc, etc) you will probably love this.

even intimated.  Left with the feeling that the United States was not going to change anything or even address this.  Are the
special interests so powerful that we are willing to sacrifice the health and longevity of a generation?  I think more follow-up

6471877,4,B00L5R5GE2,"We liked this documentary, and have added it to our collection, which includes, ""Forks Over Knives,"" ""King Corn,"" ""Food, Inc., "" and ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.""

I thought it was a good choice to have Dr. Mark Hyman, speaking in the documentary, and I wish they would also have had Dr. Joseph Mercola.  Both have a huge online presence and are well respected in the fields of health and nutrition.  I thought the show fell short in that regard.

The information and message were excellent, but I thought the following of the morbidly obese teens should have been balanced.....or maybe off-set, by following several teens from families who actually are thriving examples of how easy it is to eat truly healthy, in order to show that  not only can it be done, but that children actually enjoy it, and the benefits are huge.  Instead, all we see are the hapless, 200-something pounders, with their 300-something pound parents, all sitting around crying about their miserable lives, while slugging down 10,000 calories a day in bags of potato chips, 99 cent burgers on white bread, and washing it with umpteen liters of cola.

Since this DVD will be around for decades, and can be a really nice teach tool, it would have been nice to show families who get it, and who have raised their children the same way.  Would have been nice to follow them around the grocery store or the farmer's market, follow them around the kitchen, see what they eat on a daily basis, see what the kids take and eat at school, and learn that; hey, if children start eating raw, organic, fruits and vegetables from the word go, they don't actually know anything different, and it becomes a big huge non-event to eat healthy.  Let's face it, how are you going to get a gravy fed, french fry eating, cola drowning sloth to eat a piece of broccoli?  There's no way that's ever going to happen.

Needless to say, I hope Ms. Couric et. al, will come back for round 2, and show the other side of the coin.

Otherwise, this DVD carries a message that needs to reach a lot more people:  sugar is a major factor, if not THE major factor, in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and several cardiovascular diseases that result from obesity and hypertension.",1425513600,,615,4.894230769230769

6471920,3,B00L5R5GE2,"While this documentary ably points out the faults with our food habits and the resulting obesity, it does nothing to point you in the right direction.....i.e. good nutrition.  Not a ""balanced diet"" but a 100% plant-based diet. See Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"" and Dr. Colin Campbell's ""The China Study"".  Watch ""Forks over Knives"", ""Eating"" and ""Healing Cancer from Inside Out.""  All of them point to a plant-based lifestyle (not a fad ""diet"") as the answer to this country's health problems.  If that sounds too drastic, then what does the American public consider it when a surgeon cuts you wide open to remove part of your body?  I call that drastic.  We can never get well with pills that only mask symptoms.  We need to cut to the root of the problem, which is poor nutrition.  Our bodies are self-healing (just as a skinned knee heals itself) but because we are stuffing our mouths with junk (processed foods, sugar, fat) our bodies can't do that because our immune system has been ""trashed"".  A plant-based diet has been proven to cure most heart disease, cancers, Type II diabetes (within weeks, and no more meds) and other illnesses.  Sound too good to be true?  The dairy and meat industries have such strong lobbies, that we will never hear the truth from our government, so forget the food pyramid.  Even the USDA has set the upper limit of our fat intake so high (30%) that it is impossible to heal when it should be 9-12% - and the medical industry reaps the benefits which you stay sick.  Did you know that Starbucks pays more for their employees' health plans than they spend for their coffee beans?

Even if your kids seem normal in weight, the movie will tell you about the SOFI kids - skinny on the outside and fat on the inside. The culprit? All the added sugar and processed carbohydrates in the typical American diet. Every notice that the recommended daily allowance (RDA) isn't shown for sugars on the food nutrition labels. That is not an oversight. It is the result of the intense lobbying by big food - CocaCola, Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg, and all the rest who don't want you to know how toxic added sugar is to your diet. Added sugar and highly processed carbohydrates are driving the obesity and diabetes epidemic in the US and the food companies are crying big crocodile tears all the way to the bank. Think the answer is exercise and diet doesn't matter? Sorry, without major changes in eating habits, the obese have no chance. Exercise is important but by itself, the obesity problem will not be solved. Like I said, see this movie. Then complain to your elected representatives that there is no reason why the RDA for sugar shouldn't be shown on food labeling just like all the other things like sodium, fat, and cholesterol. The truth is, sugar is more toxic than all of them.

6471965,5,B00L5R5GE2,"The only thing I can say is that this remarkable documentary is great,
because the ""Truth is Your Best Friend.""  Therefore, anyone who
understands the value of Truth, will benefit greatly by being taught
what is going on in our food environment.
What is being exposed  in the documentary is that the Sugar Mongers are
literally RAISING DIABETICS IN THIS COUNTRY, ( AND EVENTUALLY,  GLOBALLY,
TOO) for PROFIT).  THEY ARE RAISING HUMANS AS IF THEY WERE
FARM ANIMALS.
There are 600,000 or more products on the market that contain too much sugar
per package.
THIS IS BRUTALIZATION)  FOR PROFIT.  THE VICTIMS WILL HAVE O SPEND
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES TRYING TO GET WELL. ( A friend of mine died from
diabetes).
DIABETES IS CURABLE, but there are doctors who will not tell you that
it is.  NOW PEOPLE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD ARE PROFITING, TOO.

An example of this brutalization is a woman who weighed about five hundred
pounds and who died at age 55. She never really knew how she became addicted
to fake food, because she was raised on it.  The sugar triggers the appetite,
for food, or for more sugar.  the holistic doctors say that  sugar  acts like cocaine.
Whether the wrong doers are  doing it consciously, or sub-consciously, they
are still commiting psychological crimes.
I saw a product the other day,-- A SODA,-- with 80 grams of sugar in it.  That's
the EQUIVALENT OF  TWENTY TEASPOONS OF SUGAR. And then, there's
that stuff in your fridge that has more, too.

The solution?  Here is one solution:  Put a PROTECTIVE LAW  into effect that if a
product contains more than 1 ram of sugar, the manufacturer will be penalized, or i
mprisoned, or both.

The ABSENCE OF LAW is the biggest problem.

I am  quoting one of the speakers who protested in the film, who said,
( Question):  ""Later on, maybe a decade from now, when we look back at
what happened,  we will say, ""How did we ever let them get away with it? ""

( Answer:)  We let them get away with it by the ABSENCE OF LAW to protect us
and our children.

6471967,3,B00L5R5GE2,"As someone who has read many of Michael Pollan's books on nutrition and food, in addition to many others, I felt that this documentary didn't add much to the conversation on obesity. However, it does provide an good introduction into the issue of obesity (particularly childhood obesity) and nutrition in America for those who are not well informed.

The main focus of the documentary is sugar in processed foods. Over the last few decades the amount of sugar in processed foods has been steadily increasing (due to large agricultural subsidies). The film importantly illustrates the metabolic difference between eating a handful of almonds and a spoonful of sugar, both containing the same amount of sugar. Naturally, the sugar contained within the almonds will be absorbed very slowly whereas the spoonful of sugar will cause blood sugar levels to go through the roof prompting a large insulin response. The body has to do something with all that sugar in the bloodstream since it can't burn it all at once so it stores it as fat.

The film doesn't offer much in the way of solutions to this problem besides making fresh foods more available in food deserts, educating parents, getting sugary soft drinks out of school cafeterias, and improving cafeteria lunches. But Michael Pollan said it best at the end of the film.

""The most important thing you can do -- and it's challenging for many people -- is cook, real food. You can forget about nutrients. You can forget about sugars. If you cook real food, your family will be eating much better.""",1419379200,,1547,4.8745247148288975
6471968,5,B00L5R5GE2,Love this book.  It made me realize how unhealthy sugar is.  I have cut way back on sugar and I'm working on cutting out artificial sugars and Im losing weight in the process.  I think everyone should watch this DVD.,1419379200,,216,4.35

For her to go up against the big junk food companies--like Coke and Pepsi--and to explain in an entertaining and often touching way exactly how they are doing great harm to the nation's health, was a master stroke.

6471985,3,B00L5R5GE2,I felt like much of the documentary was repetitive.  I showed it to a class as part of our discussion on industrialized food.  This could have been a shorter documentary and the audience would have gotten the same information.,1418169600,,226,4.769230769230769
6471986,2,B00L5R5GE2,"I started to hate this movie when I heard the excuse ""No one has time for exercise."" What? I'm done. You either make the time or you don't. If you can't find a way to pull yourself away from the Doritos and wheat thins for 1.5 hours a day, you're not motivated to be fit. Let me summarize this movie. Basically obese people are getting their nutritional information from the boxes/labels on store bought products. They're eating high sugar, highly processed wheat, low protein meals. Basically crap. They repeatedly say things like ""We're eating healthier, and exercising regularly. But we just can't figure it out."" Every few minutes they show what these people are eating and they point out how it's ""healthier."" Ok. Sure. Open your cupboard and fridge.. OH THERES THE CULPRIT. Various juices. Chips. Snack Wells. Wheat thins. Processed garbage. Nature Valley bars. Honey Oats. ""What did you eat for lunch son?"" ""A cheese burger, juice, and milk."" Spoken through a mouth full of chips. I don't think they once showed their portion sizes, but based on what I saw from the cupboard and fridges, it's a bunch of ignorant fat bodies getting their nutritional advice from corporations who's sole purpose is to placate the consumer and sell you crap you don't need. Also, the objective is not to make calorie out match calorie in. It's supposed to be LESS IN than OUT. Just because you burned 800 calories does not mean you can eat 700 calories of cheese burger. It's mind boggling. Wow. They used bicycling as an example of how many hours a child or someone would have to  ride to burn x amount of calories. Worst exercise to compare to. Speed. Climb. Pace. Heart rate. Avg fitness level. All play a HUGE role in calorie output when cycling, or any sport for that matter. I forget the exact math, but you would have to ride a bike for 2-3 times as long as you would to burn the same amount of calories running. I'll end my rant. I gave up on this movie because of the excuses, and the laziness.

I was 258 lbs. 5'8"" I drank. I smoked. I said to hell with it. I went paleo. I ran. I weight trained. I play sports. I'm 185lbs. And I did most of it through DIET and exercise. Low Carb. High Protein. Less in, More out. High Fat. Exercise. To hell with this ""lets make excuses for fat people"" nonsense.",1417996800,6,2295,4.527710843373494

It's incredibly sad we live in a world that allows people/companies to take advantage of the public but we also have free speech and that's how I view this documentary.  To be healthy we need to be informed.  I considered myself to be informed about healthy eating and this taught me even more.  I was really surprised by the % of sugar not appearing on labels and that scientists found that no more than 10% of our diet should consist of sugar yet 25% is what's considered part of a healthy diet.,1417392000,,550,4.310679611650485

Government did try to do well by humans initially, but caved to the demands of the meat, dairy and processed foods industries.  It has resulted in catastrophic health issues for the majority of people in America.  Unfortunately these food industries completely control the information that is given to students, creating addicts who are likely to keep eating the same foods until a different message is given.

Produced by Laurie David and Katie Couric
Produced in 2014
The purpose of this informational documentary was to basically tell why people are obese and what is causing it. The directors message was the same thing as a lot of these types of documentaries is: to eat healthy. However, this brought some new information to me about the foods that say reduced in fat and calories are really just added sugar. I knew from previous documentaries or articles that I have read that sugar is the main source of obesity. This documentary brings in personal stories from children that are obese and why it so hard for them to lose weight. They also bring evidence from data that the government tried to hide. For example the doctor recommendation of sugar level is 10% and soda cans still don't have the percentage level of sugar listed on them. The documentary had very good video quality, however some of the interview scenes were too dramatic in the sense where you couldn't understand what they were saying. I liked how they used real people instead of actors because it brings more reality and emotion to viewers to see that this is going on in the world.  It left me thinking that, maybe theres something I can do to help? I think they should of talked at least a little about what we can eat in order to be healthier. I liked the message however it was repeated to much and made the documentary very boring for me. So I don't recommend the documentary however I think its message should be known.",1413158400,,1499,4.551851851851852

The Raw Truth of Obesity

In the United States, it is estimated that 93 Million Americans are affected by obesity.  Fed Up is eye-opening, informational documentary that will share the reason so many Americans are dealing with obesity. The film proves that it is not always the consumers fault for being obese but instead how brainwashed society is.  For years society has blamed the fat guy for being obese but in reality its not just his blunder; there are so many other factors then just calorie counting.  Personally, before watching this film, I did not know that much about how corrupt the food industry.  I also learned a lot about how all sugars are the same and how healthier processed foods are just as unhealthy as regular processed foods.
One part of the documentary that I thought was especially powerful was when the film explained how the food industry has learned to pin point children because they are easier to manipulate into thinking their food is fun and healthy.  Kids watch an average of 4000 food-related ads every year (10/day) and 98% of food related ads that children view (3920/year) are for products high in fat, sugar, sodium.  I realized that if we do not do anything about this problem now future generations will be uneducated and things will get a lot worse then they already are.
Although this film was very good at calling attention and proving and that the food industry is corrupt, it would be better if they offered solutions as well.  I can definitely relate to everything this documentary is saying and some parts really touched me, but when I was done with this film it left me with a bad taste in my mouth because I didn't know what I could personally do about it.  After the documentary was over my curiosity about the topic led me to the Fed Up website where I learned about all the projects this organization is participating in.  I think it is very good that they have that on their website, but what if they put more of it in their documentary.",1413158400,,2078,4.632152588555858

6472137,3,B00L5R5GE2,"The only issue that I had with the film, Fed Up, was that throughout the course of the documentary, they are force-feeding fact after fact, apocalyptic note after apocalyptic note, to the point where I was a little exhausted as a viewer. However, for a documentary like this, in order for them to get their point across, they have to be sincere and note the gravity of the situation, which they are and they do - very effectively.  The filmmakers detail how obesity is a bigger killer than starvation and how sugar is more addictive than cocaine. Another example, a comparison is made between sodas and cigarettes in order to relay the point that essentially, when you consume these processed foods, you are killing yourself. Perhaps the way in which they present it could be slightly altered, for they do make it seem as if were you to eat one bite of processed food or take one sip of a sugared beverage, you are condemned to death. They also take an in-depth look at some of the physiology behind the topic, including resultant exercise habits, and how the public is negatively impacted, even though we may think otherwise. In spite of this, I would recommend the documentary  because it takes a very truthful look at how the current food industry and consumerism have changed the US, and its people, to this day. It beckons the public to be more aware of how companies may not have the consumers best, and most healthy, interest at heart; that rather than being motivated by creating a healthy product for the public, they are more interested in deceiving the public in order to turn a bigger profit.",1413072000,,1604,4.6643109540636045

6472141,5,B00L5R5GE2,"We purchased Fed Up after my husband's latest visit to the doctor:  he was told to stop drinking soda, eat healthier, lose weight, and try to live a more life-positive lifestyle.  If he didn't, well, he wouldn't need to worry about scheduling a check up next year.  Our lifestyle consists of 14-hour days, many meals out, and almost a 2-liter of soda a day for each of us--his regular, mine diet (IDDM).

I ordered Fed Up when a server at our favorite restaurant mentioned it as we were eating salads.  A few days later the DVD arrived and frankly, it made me feel ill to see some of the material included.  I have begun reading labels like any other health-conscious person, and the effects of avoiding the three prongs of processing, added sugar, and aspartame have been immediate.

He lost 20 lbs in less than 3 weeks.  I have lost two sizes and while the weight isn't dropping off the scale, I no longer have WATER RETENTION or any pain in my joints like I had before.  My face, waist, wrists, ankles...pick a body part...is showing the absence of the three, and I can only thank the producers of Fed Up for that.  I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own.  I hadn't been able to do it on my own.  All I can say is that I was blind to all the crap I was putting into my body...and now my eyes are more open.

Is it a cure marketed as a DVD?  No, but it is a place to start.  It reminds me of when Super Size Me came out:  everyone was grossed out, but still went back to fast food.  Fed Up will have a more lasting effect.  I wish you all the best!",1413072000,2,1556,4.13

6472149,4,B00L5R5GE2,"""Fed up"" is a documentary co produced by Laurie David and Katie Couric and directed by Stephanie Soechtig. Its purpose is to be as informative as possible to the public about the statistics on the obesity epidemic in America.

Throughout the documentary, Stephanie Soechtig peels back the mask of the American food industry and paints a clearer picture of the effects it has on American obesity rates. It is clear that she wants us as Americans to become more aware about what we eat, and what we put in it so as to not damage our future.

When I first started watching this film, I thought it would be similar to ""Food inc."" However, I found it refreshingly shocking to find myself watching a documentary that showed what it effects it has on us as humans. Stephanie Soechtig does an amazing job of showing us the dark side of what we eat and the effects it has on us. She not only shows us the what, but the how and why we must change the way we eat and how we make or food. The interviews were sad and deep, and images and camera angles seemed to want to shape everything that I was seeing into a moment of shocking revelation.

If anything, this documentary will impact viewers in the way that will make them think twice about the world we live in. They will most definitely be as surprised as I was about the mentioned statistics. As a final note, I suggest that viewers sit down with a pen and paper and write down what they hear. Their notes will further deepen(s) Stephanie Soechtig message about a need for change and add an exciting element to this shocking documentary.",1412985600,,1580,4.441379310344828

Producers: Laurie David and Katie Couric
Release Date: 2014
Running Time: 92 minutes

How much do you really know about the food that you put into your body? What causes obesity and diabetes in America? How can we prevent these diseases?

Fed up is a documentary about the food industry in America and the real reason Americans are becoming obese. The documentary was produced by Laurie David and Katie Couric in 2014. Katie Couric also narrates the film. The producers intentions were to inform viewers that calories are not what are making people obese, but sugar is the ingredient to blame. Also, they say that the food industry is tricking people into believing their products are better for them by labeling them as reduced fat or no fat, when in reality, the product is equally as bad as it would be with the fat. Along with giving numerous facts and statistics about the food industry and how the food we eat is made, the documentary also interviews four kids between the ages of ten and fifteen who are obese. The film follows these four kids weight loss journeys and informs viewers of their progress at the end. The camera angles were creative and the sound in the background fit for the dramatic effect in the film. The interviews were a nice touch, because viewers were able to understand what it is like to be obese from a childs perspective. They also included interviews with various journalists, politicians, doctors, as well as former president, Bill Clinton. I would have enjoyed seeing more interviews with obese children, and hearing about whether their obesity makes normal, everyday tasks, more difficult. However, with startling statistics like 1 in every 3 Americans will have diabetes by 2050, Fed Up is a must-see film for everyone.",1412899200,,1766,4.841059602649007
6472168,3,B00L5R5GE2,"Have you been aware of the rising obesity in America? Have you blamed it on the intake themselves instead of the companies who created the food? What would you do if you were overweight and wanted to put an end to that?
Fed Up is a documentary regarding the effects of our food industry on Americans pointing out our sugar intake, the false advertising of companies, and political corruption in order to keep people eating unhealthy foods. Throughout the documentary, obese teenagers and children are featured failing to lose weight due to the unhealthy outsourcing of cafeteria food to private corporations and the advertising of reduced fat foods being just as unhealthy and fattening as their normal counterparts. While initially entertaining and compelling, the clips become the repetitive message of  This kid is fat, he/she eats lots of sugar and its the corporations fault. Sugar is bad. Sugar makes you fat, ect. The documentary also fails to show any long term, useful solutions for the general public to stop the epidemic, instead pointing fingers to the corporations for the majority of the show. The feel of this documentary ends up being like a news special, if it was stretched to a full hour and a half feature film, with little differences. It did open up the world of food in ways that most people did not know about, regarding the daily intake of sugar we have compared to what's recommended, as well as the ineffectiveness of diet and reduced fat/calorie foods. The film could have been shorter to give the same message. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1412899200,,1569,4.789667896678967

6472170,4,B00L5R5GE2,"Hearing the title I actually expected this documentary to be a lot more about food itself than obesity. Before watching the film I knew obesity was a serious issue, but I thought it was caused by laziness in people which, according to the documentary, is actually not true.

 ""Fed Up"" is a documentary about obesity in American youth. It's a very informational documentary that was able to keep me interested, but seemed to get a little repetitive at times. There were a lot of facts and statistics that were interesting, however the film overstated those same statistics making me uninterested in certain parts. I would've liked to have seen a lot more from the families perspectives, because the film came off as more of an obesity awareness film than a documentary about obesity. The stories were the best part, I think. It really made you feel for those who suffer from obesity, instead of just categorizing it as human laziness (like I did). Overall, even with the repetition of statistics , I enjoyed this film.

6472193,5,B00L5R5GE2,"I first learned about this film when Laurie David was a guest on the very much missed Katie Couric Show.  After having serious health issues myself and watching my husband fight and lose his battle with lung cancer just over a year ago, I have saturated my mind with information about preventing serious, chronic and fatal diseases.  I've read books by many of the ""experts"" who appear in the film, and highly recommend their material. Hippocrates, regarded as the father of medicine, famously wrote: Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food circa 425 b.c -- long before there were mega-food corporations, processed food, fast-food chains, refined white sugar and all the rest.  He was so right.  You are what you eat.  This film packs a lot of great information into 99 min.  Much of it I'd heard before, but still learned new things.  Sugar and processed foods ARE addictive. Having 85% or more of the shelves in our grocery stores filled with these products makes it difficult if not impossible for the average person to understand how harmful eating these products as a steady diet are.  It's appalling the fast food chains have infiltrated the school lunch programs, and the money from food lobbies controls the information disseminated by the World Health Organization and our government. Literally, YOUR HEALTH IS YOUR LIFE.  Without your health, you have nothing.  It is also unacceptable that all medical schools today do not require a solid education in nutrition.  Maybe that's because their facilities and research are funded by the pharmaceutical companies?  Money talks.  My late husband was hospitalized for the last five months of his life in a community hospital and two world-class hospitals in Los Angeles which cater to celebrities.  The food they served patients at all three of these hospitals was packed with sugar, simple carbs and saturated fat -- poison.  Our health insurance company spent over $3,000,000 -- yes, that's $3Million -- in 5 months paying hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, etc for ""treatments"" which only ""tortured"" my husband, made him suffer unspeakably while the doctors got rich.  Who pays that $3Million?  All of us when our health insurance premiums go up.  Who's going to pay for the medical care for the obese teens shown in this film if they don't correct their diets?  All of us.  The issues presented in this film are HUGE and far-reaching.  Knowledge truly is power. Since our government and our alleged ""health-care"" system is being more or less bribed not to put our best interests first, I applaud everyone involved in making this film for educating the public.",1411948800,4,2638,5.004587155963303

Studies mentioned in the film claim sugar is 5 times more addictive than cocaine in rat studies.  So it is time to look at the food corporations who are adding sugar to every food imaginable, while trying to hide what they are doing, as pushers of a dangerous drug in the literal sense of the word.  And we all know a drug pusher is the lowest form of scum.  Obesity is in reality the biggest threat to national security, and we are literally under attack by food corporations and advertising.

6472200,1,B00L5R5GE2,"With so much buzz and star-power behind Fed Up, I was sure I'd love it.  Boy was I disappointed.

First let me summarize the entire movie in 3 words: sugar is evil.  That's it.  With glancing mentions of GMO, environmental change, fat gluttony, or any of the milieu of other issues, Fed Up decided to reduce the entire problem of obesity to sugar.

With reckless abandon, it dismantles the calories in-versus-calories out contention.  In that section it makes the classic conflation of points by making a controvertible statement, following it with a fact, and treating both therefore as fact.

Even if I bought into that contention, and I was willing to be open-minded for the film, Fed Up fails to deliver any real solution.  A well-done documentary is typically a build-up to a message, then a call-to-action around that message.  It supports it thesis thoroughly and evidences it with results to compel to viewer to action the message.  And that's where Fed Up completely falls apart.  Throughout the film we follow three very obese kids trying to figure out why no amount of dieting and exercise is helping them get thinner.  But in the end, two of the three don't lose weight at all and the third loses it just to gain it all back.  I found that incredibly demotivating, since if the thesis for change could not be proven with results, why would I buy into the effort to implement them?

The biggest failure of Fed Up is its failure to prove its point.  If the point is that sugar is the bad guy and the cause of weight gain, then limiting sugar in the diet should result in weight loss.  But after spending 90 minutes trying to make that point, Fed Up fails to show any results for its effort.  The fact that neither the writer nor director had a problem with this lack of resolution is, itself, a problem, because it leaves the viewer wondering how much of the movie they can trust.  Did limiting sugar work for other people?  Then why are they not in the movie?  Why did the people who were in the movie fail to make any sustainable progress?  And if they're already bought-in and following the recommendations of the film, but not seeing results, why should I bother?

Better than ask these questions, just save your $10 and move on.  There's nothing worth seeing here.

EDIT: 10/14/2014:
Some people in the comments seem to be confused by this review.  To be clear, my 1-star rating is for the documentary film  (the product being rated), not a judgment on sugar as a health hazard.",1411776000,47,2493,4.596371882086168
6472201,2,B00L5R5GE2,"I enjoyed the topic but the documentary itself was disappointing.  It is quite slow to start, scattered, lacked substance & primarily presents  Americans as ""helpless"" against obesity while vilifying food corporations.  There is no professional journalism objectivity whatsoever.  It definitely possesses some valuable information with some segments from credible contributors.  However, it is not presented in a polished, concise format.  It is no secret that American government works in tandem with big corporate and industry players either through subsidiaries or lobbyists.  The documentary points out how even Michelle Obama's ""Move"" Campaign has been pacified by major food companies.  Our country has yet to address the issue of toxic foods being served to our children in school cafeterias.  This film omits crucial components to our obesity epidemic, such as the current socialization of Americans primarily consuming processed foods and our ignorance to what ""healthy"" food actual is.  Aside from the school setting, children are dependent on what adult parents purchase and serve.  This factor was not explored.  Again, no professional objectivity. I believe discussing America's lack of food intelligence, our behavior towards food, & why we believe it is acceptable to eat/serve processed junk & with what generation did this change occur,  are vital components in reclaiming our health.

The documentary also makes some ridiculous comparisons like sugar to cocaine & displays a study with lab rats. While I do agree excessive sugar is ABSOLUTELY toxic to the body, producing drastic physiological effects and some persons actually have a true ""food addiction,""  I believe it is an untrue implication that all overweight & obese persons have an ""addiction"" to sugar.  For persons that have a true food addiction and get clean, they generally need to go through a detox program, counseling  and have ongoing support with the issue to maintain ""sobriety.""  I believe highly processed foods break down almost immediately into sugar, directly affecting our blood sugar levels, creating highs and lows, resulting in a merry go round of lethargy and cravings.  I believe the majority of Americans consume primarily processed foods and I do not believe the majority of Americans are experiencing true food addiction.  I think this overdramatizing claim negatively impacted the credibility of the documentary and was looking to support the notion we are absolutely ""helpless"" against obesity.  I additionally question the reliability, validity, and design of the study. No substantial identifying info was given about the study- where, who, & how it was being performed.

I anticipated a much better documentary from a seasoned journalist like Katie Couric.  Our country's health & the issue we consume primarily processed garbage instead of freshly prepared food are issues that need to be addressed.  So I do appreciate attention to this topic.

It's barely detectable that sugar and processed carbs (not fats and dietary cholesterol) are a huge contributor to heart disease.  It talks a lot about processed foods, but never really defines what is considered ""processed food"" (all food is ""processed""... some more than others, right?

It should have made it clearer that most grain products (bread and pasta, i.e. man-made), even when made with whole wheat, are highly processed and should be minimized.

6472218,5,B00L5R5GE2,"I just received my DVD from Amazon.  It is very good.  It will help wake up the population to the health problems of eating food that is not always good for you.  A few years ago, Dr Barry Sears, released a book called ""Toxic Fat: When Good Fat Turns Bad"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toxic-Fat-When-Good-Fat-Turns-Bad/dp/1401604293/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toxic Fat: When Good Fat Turns Bad</a>

While ""Fed Up"" is an excellent documentary, it is only one (albeit a major) piece of the diet/health puzzle.  Fed UP aims squarely at the fact that eating ""cheap carbs"", sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc, makes YOU FAT.  This is true, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.  Dr Sears discovered that when excessive omega-6 unsaturated fats are consumed which are not matched by omega-3 unsaturated fats (high quality fish oil), these combined with the ""cheap carbs"" to produce ""silent inflammation"", that goes on for years and becomes not so silent inflammation as it destroys your body.  ""Getting fat"" is usually only one symptom of this process.  Additional effects include metabolic syndrome that progresses to diabetes.  Also artery plaquing and arthritis is also caused by the silent inflammation caused by too much omega-6s combined with too many ""cheap carbs"" (sugars, and other high glycemic foods, such as bread and chips that ""flash"" into sugar immediately upon eating). ""Getting Fat"" is usually the only external (visible) effect of this lifestyle, but the internal damage is far worse.

Since 1957, when the (incorrect) push to ditch ""saturated fat"" started, and thus switch people over to ""heart healthy unsaturated fats"", has lead to this mess.  Too much omega-6s ""heart healthy"" fats are really ""heart deadly"" fats (unless taken with equal omega-3s). Most saturated fats (e.g. butter, coconut oil), and pretty healthy for you.  In 1957, they used ""hydrogenated"" coconut oil to clog arteries.  Hydrogenated oils are full of trans-fats, which are deadly, and they didn't know that in 1957.  Virgin or expeller pressed coconut oil is quite healthy.  Dr Sears states, that omega-6 fats consumed must be matched by am almost equal portion of omega-3 fats to achieve balance.  The omega-6s create inflammatory conditions, when taken, and also in the future. Omega-3s create anti-inflammatory conditions, thus a balance is needed.

One BIG problem, is that omega-3s are all unstable in air, they go rancid quickly.  Therefore almost all oils found in prepared food (sunflower, soy, corn, safflower, canola, etc) are all majorly omega-6 based, since omega-6s are stable in air and ""taste good"".  Olive oil is a special case, an Omega-9 (Oleic acid), that is anti-inflammatory like an omega-3.  Any thing fried, any chips, etc, any food you find with ""oils"" in it, are probably mostly omega-6s, leading to inflammation, when combined with the excessive sugars as FED UP documents. While some nuts (Almonds, etc) can have benefits, their oils are mostly omega-6s still.

One solution is to take lots of high quality fish oil (Dr Sears), as much as 10 grams/day of EPA-DHA may be needed.  Since highly refined good fish oils (Dr Sears brand, and Life Extension Foundation brand) are 60% EPA-DHA, 18 fish oil pills per day may be needed to rectify the inflammation.  Getting a lipids blood test will show you your HDL (good cholesterol) as well as triglycerides.  Dr Sears states that your inflammation is whipped when your triglycerides are 1X to 2X the value of your HDL.  If the trig/HDL ratio is higher, then you have damaging inflammation going on, so more fish oil is needed.  The EPA and DHA omega-3 fats are the work horses in combatting inflammation.  People ask what about taking ""flax seed"" (ALA) oil instead.  Sure, it works, but the body can only convert 1 gram per day into useful EPA/DHA, and the rest gets wasted, so the best is taking high quality fish oil.

Today, the average American gets only 0.15 grams of omega-3 fats, and 40-50 grams or more of inflammatory omega-6s.  Even cutting back the sugars, these excessive omega-6s will still lead to diabetes, artery plaquing, heart attacks, etc.  I hear of people having plugged arteries and heart attacks in their low 30s now. These omega-6s become part of your tissues, and continue to emit signaling molecules that result in continued inflammation and damage. I have been taking Life Extension Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA (fish oil) which also contains sesame lignans and olive fruit extracts for years, six pills per meal. I have perfect lipids and no ongoing inflammation. My doctors cannot believe it, and I don't take statins either.  This fish oil has undone years of bad eating (excessive omega-6s in chips, fries, etc), before Dr Sears came along and discovered the inflammation / omega-6 / excessive sugars connection.

Also, Olive oil, an Omega-9, while healthy on salads, etc, breaks down when used in cooking.  Cooking with coconut oil is a good idea, since it is a fully saturated fat, and has no double bonds to break down at high temps. It is usable to 450 F.

Somebody needs to do a follow on documentary, combining what is in FED UP, and the teachings of Dr Barry Sears, including the inflammation angle as part of the bigger picture.",1410825600,27,5268,5.084883720930232

6472224,4,B00L5R5GE2,"Too often, documentaries exposing propaganda are themselves guilty of the same tactic. It is inherent to the genre, and one should always approach such programs with rational skepticism. Doing so enriches the viewer's experience, and this film in particular.

Putting aside the liberal love-fest bias (not unexpected considering Perky Katie's involvement), ""Fed Up"" does a fairly good job in outlining both the history of the US food industry as well as the science of caloric physiology as it pertains to obesity. There are also the obligatory sob-stories to tug our emotions.

The premise that food industry lobbying, misguided government policies, marketing strategies, and foremost, the quality of industrially processed foods are major contributors to increasing obesity rates cannot be refuted. Almost everyone after watching this will learn new and possibly disturbing information, and in this regard many of us will henceforth adjust our eating habits. Visits to the supermarket will never be the same. I know mine won't.

The analogy to the tobacco industry is somewhat forced but not off the mark considering the detrimental health impact of smoking and obesity. The normal response is: ""Something must be done about this!!"" However, the goal to systemically alter dietary habits is much more difficult than convincing people not to smoke. Even the least educated among us can grasp that ""cancer is deadly"" and can understand the direct connection between lung disease and smoking. Even so it took decades to change the attitude toward smoking, and it's still prevalent. People can understand that ""being obese is bad"", but unless they also understand the relationship between the *quality* of food, obesity, and ultimate health consequences, I'm afraid the battle will take exponentially longer than it did with smoking. People will have to unlearn what have been marketed for years and years as ""healthy"" foods: ""Low Fat"" and ""Low Calorie"" junk.

The documentary weighs too heavily on school lunches. Whatever type of food the little darlings eat at school is but a small fraction of whatever they eat outside of school year round. Not knowing any better, Couric leads you to believe that simply changing the school lunch will solve the problem, or at least significantly impact the rate of childhood obesity. I call BS on that, and oh, how convenient that the film came out just as Mrs Obama's school lunch overhaul debuted nationwide. Perhaps she and Couric could have walked the red carpet hand in hand for both premieres! But, of course, it was simply coincidental....

Kids spend about 180 out of 365 days in school. Assuming just 3 meals/day, that's 1095 meals/year, of which only 180 would be Obamafood. And that's not counting the incessant snacking which probably doubles the sugar intake. Can anyone actually argue with a straight face that that will significantly impact lifetime obesity figures?  Don't misunderstand, I wholeheartedly agree with Mrs Obama's intention, and from what I heard, the food is of reasonable quality. Further, perhaps the real pay off to healthy school lunch standard is educating kids on, and introducing them to better foods. What I do take issue with is Couric's contrived elevation of Mrs Obama's endeavor as ultimate panacea. The best one can say is commend her for raising awareness, and every little bit helps, but her proposed changes will have minimal impact.

In the end, the kids most successful in losing weight were the ones whose families took the initiative to modify the home cooked meals, unrelated to whatever junk or no junk they served at school. The one who underwent bariatric surgery and subsequently regained all the weight? Remember his father in the beginning saying how he buys all the food for him? Pre-dict-able.

One can live without smoking, but one cannot live without food. Unless we educate the public to make their own INFORMED decisions just as with smoking, reflex government mandated restrictions on the foods we eat will be rightfully rejected. This is why Bloomberg's soda size ban failed. This also explains the push back from many school districts to the changes. A nanny takes care of those who do not know better, thus he earned the title.

Yet despite all my criticism, I applaud this documentary as at least an effort pointing in the right direction, hence 3.5 stars.

6472227,5,B00L5R5GE2,"Fed Up begins with four children telling us about their struggles to lose weight and to cope with the cruel taunts of classmates because of their size.  Their parents don't seem to know what to do and, like most of us, suffer when their children suffer.  They try to help.  One mother shows us the processed cereal she feeds her child because it's low fat.  One of the boys fixes his ""healthy"" lunch - peanut butter and grape jelly on white bread, a banana and Cheez-its. Several eat the school lunch...pizza, hamburgers, French fries...not a vegetable in sight. Their diets are causing them to develop metabolic syndrome, a condition that includes high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer's, and cancer, among other diseases. Obesity is just one symptom, although the movie points out that people can be thin on the outside and fat on the inside and are just as much at risk.

Why have they gotten to this point? It's not the kids' fault, the experts say.  Junk food, foisted on us by the processed food and fast food industries, is leading us to a health catastrophe.  The food, with its high percentage of sugar, salt and fat, is addictive and omnipresent. Its empty calories are converted to dangerous internal fat more readily than the calories in nourishing food. Additionally, these companies market their food to children on television, on the Internet, and by taking over school lunch programs, making sure that our children develop an early affinity and lifelong dependence on processed/junk food.  The movie goes into great detail about how the US government is complicit in this problem by promoting the interests of big agribusiness and food companies over the health of our children.  It then predicts that a tsunami of health problems will soon follow if we don't find a solution and the costs will dwarf our current national debt, .

What's the answer?  Well, it's not just exercise.  For example, if you drink a soda, you would have to bike well over an hour to work off the calories.  Add potato chips and you have to bike twice as long. While Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative is laudable, it's not enough (and it is being ""helped"" by such companies as Coca Cola and Kellogg, which means the real solution was eliminated from the program for political reasons). The movie suggests that we start solving this problem by 1) changing the way we produce and consume food - a difficult process that involves pressuring our government to get its priorities straight, make laws that protect our health, and quit subsidizing the very industry that is making us sick; and 2) giving people knowledge and tools to cook healthy, real food meals at home...the movie directs you to the Fed Up website to get started with the Fed Up challenge.

I thought this was an excellent overview of a very real problem.  There are other resources that provide more thorough coverage, but this is a good start.  If you want to know more, I would suggest you first watch Robert Lustig's Sugar: The Bitter Truth (Google the transcript if you don't want to watch for 1.5 hours). This will tell you all you need to know about the biochemistry behind how our body processes and stores food. Lustig's book, Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease goes into more detail and gives suggestions for moving to a real food diet.  Michael Pollen's Omnivore's Dilemma, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss, and Pandora's Lunchbox: How Processed Food Took Over the American Meal will tell you how our food arrived at its seemingly hopeless state.  The movie did not address obesity caused by eating in response to stress, but  The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite by David Kessler reiterates the role of processed food in compulsive and emotional eating while giving concrete steps for overcoming the pull of ""highly palatable"" foods through a form of cognitive therapy.  Other great resources for kickstarting healthy eating are the website www. 100daysofrealfood.com and the smartphone app, Fooducate (also a website) that allows you to scan a barcode and see a food's grade based on its processing and nutritional content.

If it does nothing else, I hope this movie will stir people to think about what they eat and dietary changes they can make to sustain their own good health and that of their family.  Making personal changes will be a piece of cake compared to changing the political and economic supports for food that is making us sick, but we can make our positions known to lawmakers and hope for the best.",1410220800,96,4632,4.866412213740458
6472228,3,B00L5R5GE2,"MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT ON SUGAR AND JUNK CARBS.

This 2014 Fed Up DVD is not to be confused with 2002 DVD of the same name. Earlier DVD addressed different issues.

I agree that ""Fed Up"" is of little value to anyone who has more than a passing basic knowledge of nutrition, dietary health, and related issues. Its unfortunate that Katie Couric opens with a patently false We are eating less fat and fewer calories which has NO factual foundation. Calories from fat in American diet is still well over 30%. It does not help to recycle the personal responsibility argument regarding smoking in blaming the consumer for the massive industry efforts to brain wash the public with help of revolving door between USDA and those marketing very unhealthy food. Usual safe platitudinous eat more fruits and vegetables is suggested but without the  current overwhelming arguments for a 100% Plant-Based Whole Food life style. Sarah Pallan warns us of Nanny State. Big Food USDA conflict of interest and Sugar Lobby influence is covered OK - with often ignored evil role played by Tommy Thompson implied.

Opportunity to honor memory of George McGovern, a great American, was missed. He had quite a story to tell in the 1970s.

Platitudes on the dangers of sugar and unhealthy junk carbohydrates was worthy but little if any attention was devoted to dietary connections to the incidence of cancer. Demonizing sugar is all to the good. But proven benefits of a vegan diet was missing. As were citations featuring scholars of the caliber of T. Colin Campbell, Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neil Barnard, Nathan Priitikin, and top extreme vegan athletes. Featuring gurus such as obese Kelly Brownell (with triple chins) was detracting. As was repeated quotes from fat Gary Taubes who consistently ignores above scholars. Looks aren't everything. But seldom have I seen such a large collection of extremely unattractive morbidly obese uneducated folks speaking such a sub-standard slurred American English. Very hard to look at or listen to. It would have been nice to have seen at least SOME hint of personal transformation. ALAS, my hopes were dashed. Giving a pass to AHA calling 25-35% calories from fat as low fat. Some Washington insiders are critical of Processed Food Lobby folks. DUH.

6472230,4,B00L5R5GE2,"I recommend this documentary. Well produced and well worth the price. Four stars for one unnecessary cheap shot. With that exception, I think a great piece of work.",1409702400,,164,4.892857142857143
6472231,5,B00L5R5GE2,"Very well done documentary exposing a major issue that affects our collective health. It is absolutely devastating that science is ""covered up"" for the sake of BIG FOOD and profit. Our country continues to go into debt supporting a healthcare system that will fail. If our government continues to ignore this issue by failing to make changes at the policy-level, we will soon be in the midst of a health epidemic that will be difficult to reverse. This documentary should be shown in hospitals, schools, and in any community setting where people can be educated and empowered to make changes for themselves and not rely on those who ""represent"" them.",1408924800,17,650,4.918181818181818
6472232,5,B00L5R5GE2,"A must watch for every parent here in the US! I left the theater with a completely different perspective on school lunches and nutrition. I have now tried to take some of the learning into practice and it has indeed affected my body and health in a positive way! It will also make you look at your shopping cart very different,as i just did not realize how seemingly off my nutritional choices have been.",1408924800,16,404,4.472972972972973

8663947,1,B00L5R5GE2,"At first I enjoyed this documentary. They explained the real problem with our obesity epidemic. A Calorie is not a calorie. We need to eat real foods. However, then they started making everyone into victims! We need the government to save us because we are not capable of making our own healthy decisions. Ridiculous!! Get the government out of food. Period. Then we wouldnt have to worry, as high fructose corn syrup would no longer be subsidized. Junk food would cost more....",1522454400,,478,4.841463414634147

8663951,5,B00L5R5GE2,Eye opener.  Sugar is killing this country.  If you want to lose weight watch this video with your family.  Very educational.  I have lost weight with no dieting because of this video.  Every time I find myself slipping back into sugar I look at this video. Wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!.,1518652800,,292,4.433962264150943
8663952,5,B00L5R5GE2,"What I HATED were the previews that I could not skip over.  I was showing it to a class, and its hard enough to squeeze it in in 2 class periods. And Harvey Weinsteins name is all over UGH!!

But its an excellent film, really.",1515542400,,226,4.0
