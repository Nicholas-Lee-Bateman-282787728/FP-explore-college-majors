8238743,5,B0010VUTM2,Very good DVD video with the basics of the F650GS that you need to consider before to start riding it!,1376006400,,102,4.15
8238744,1,B0010VUTM2,"Very basic information. If you never maintained a motorcycle (like, never changed an air filter) this might be an interesting video. Adventure touring instruction? No. Go to the ""adventure rider"" web page for serious information. Hard to believe that this is sold for ~ $30 on Amazon.",1330560000,,284,5.0638297872340425
8238745,1,B0010VUTM2,"Just the very basics and not at all specific to the F650GS. No inside BMW knowledge here.
If you know how to change a spark plug and air filter you don't need this DVD. Very dissapoited.",1259884800,,186,4.194444444444445
8238746,4,B0010VUTM2,"This is a great video for the F650GS by Helge Pedersen who's ridden the F as much as anybody, I suppose, and he lays out some very helpful advice for the kinds of repairs travellers might encounter. Not the be all, end all of maintenance but a good start, covering the basics.",1210291200,,276,4.326923076923077
