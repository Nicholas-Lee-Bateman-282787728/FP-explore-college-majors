3455361,4,B001ANWA8G,Lizabeth Scott really shows her stuff in this old classic. I enjoyed this movie many times and I'm sure it'll be one of your faves.,1250726400,3,131,4.28

Johnny loves Eddie.
Eddie is getting tired of Johnny.
Eddie wants Paula.
Paula wants Sheriff Tom.
Sheriff Tom annoys Paula.
Paula wants Eddie.
Johnny hates Paula.
Somebody has a gun.
And, then the fun begins!
Lizabeth Scott makes it work. Burt Lancaster is restrained and doesn't overplay it as the sheriff.
Mary Astor steals every scene she is in as Paula's mother.
This is a odd film that can still find its audience after more than 60 years, and it is very entertaining!",1250380800,18,494,4.689655172413793
3455363,5,B001ANWA8G,"I love this movie and it isn't because of plot, direction, or even the story.  This is film noir at its strangest and I am a big fan of this genre. The color is so gorgeous, and Mary Astor is so good that this is
a treat for anyone who likes film noir.  I recommend this highly for the
true fan, and the print is perfect.",1241395200,13,321,3.8484848484848486
3455364,5,B001ANWA8G,"At long last, this 1940s potboiler has been released on a video format, albeit in a foreign edition. No worries; you can turn the Portuguese subtitles off. And it's playable on all regions.

This isn't a great movie, but it's engrossing entertainment. Lizabeth Scott plays the daughter of Mary Astor, owner of a Chuckawalla, Nevada casino. Scott gets involved with a shady hoodlum, played by John Hodiak, and Astor and Burt Lancaster (in one of his first film roles) - here playing a sheriff - do everything they can to thwart the romance. Complications ensue, with a predictably overheated, melodramatic ending.

Lizabeth Scott, smoky-voiced and drop-dead beautiful, is wonderful to watch and a sympathetic heroine; Hodiak is stiff and uncharismatic (he never became a big star); not very convincing as an actor, he looks suave enough. Lancaster is wasted in his role: he might have been more effective as Hodiak's character. The movie is dominated, though, and practically swiped away from under everyone's noses, by Mary Astor. Though she has supporting billing, her authority and edgy, formidable swankiness has the viewer drawn to her: she fairly seethes with charged charisma.

One of the best reasons to see this, though, is the stunning Technicolor photography. And, as I understand it, one of the very few film noir movies to be shot in color. And this is one of the best processing jobs (at the time) in evidence: the colors are radiant, natural, hues pleasing, more subdued than many of the hideously garish processing jobs that marred so many of the movies of the 40s.

I hope Universal (which owns Paramount's older libary) puts out an official America release soon.",1232236800,35,1679,5.028776978417266
8278238,5,B001ANWA8G,Wonderful movie  in  Color.  Will  play  in English  too. Very  good  cast  in  a fast moving  story.  Too bad  we  have  to  resort  on imports to  obtain  vintage  American moves  and  music.,1471651200,,193,4.375
8278239,5,B001ANWA8G,Desert Fury it a terrific film that keeps you guessing and gives you a surprise at the end.....,1418688000,,95,4.333333333333333
8278240,1,B001ANWA8G,"A technical disaster, horrible quality, the ravaging of a fine film!!! Will never buy from this seller again!!!",1406246400,,111,5.222222222222222
8278241,4,B001ANWA8G,"This is another movie that stuck with me from having seen it when I was little.  I didn't remember the title, had to look it up.  Once the title was found, hoped that I could find a way to see it again.  I watch for things pretty faithfully on TCM, but never saw it being broadcast.  So was very happy to see that it was available to buy.  You never know whether something  you remembered is going to be disappointing, but I was very happy with this one.  I like Wendell Corey - a different role for him and he was great as always.  Like Lizabeth Scott.  She was beautiful.  Everyone in it was good - quite a good cast!  So surprising that it has 'disappeared'.  It says that it is Portuguese, but only a few things were written in Portuguese and it was very easy just to watch it in English.  It was a beautiful copy - glowing color, as someone else commented.  Watched on HDTV and no graininess at all that I could see.  Wonder if there was a previous problem that has been taken care of, since the negative experience of the one reviewer?",1381881600,2,1041,4.213197969543147
8278242,4,B001ANWA8G,"Desert  Fury has always been one of my favorites.  It is too bad the US doesn't release a version.  The Portuguese print is very good.  The Portuguese subtitles can be shut off.  It was, at last, great to see a print where the reels had not been switched around and the story could be seen the way it was filmed.  Mary Astor dominated every scene she was in - a joy to watch.  Edith Heads costuming was outstanding.  Great close ups of Lizabeth Scott.  Lancaster, in one of his first films, does a good job, as well as Scott.  Great technicolour print.  Great debut film for Wendell Cory.  I think the realationship between he and John Hodiak in the film had some suggestive undertones. Good cast and a good film to watch.",1381104000,3,722,4.386363636363637
8278243,3,B001ANWA8G,the quality of the video was not very good it was recorded on a defective dvd  a half hour into the movie the dvd started hestating and the picture became un watchable.,1367712000,,168,4.25
8278244,1,B001ANWA8G,"I'm sorry that the ""Desert Fury"" DVD that I bought has the same scratchy-grainy image of a ""Murphy Brown"" show, which I recorded on VHS tape some 20 years ago. This is contrary to the seller's note: ""Excellent quality film on DVD-R!""

So I contacted the vendor, as Amazon recommended. I proposed that they try to get me a better quality copy of the movie. They didn't respond. I guess they weren't in possession of ""Desert Fury"" that was ""Excellent quality film on DVD-R!""

Also, the movie was clearly recorded over a science fiction presentation, which was playing at the end of the credits. For the company's image, management might wish to look into this practice.

Vendor will never get a 95% positive seller rating with results and service like that. There's still time for improvement. I pray for that to happen.",1361923200,12,818,4.746478873239437
8278245,4,B001ANWA8G,"This movie from the late 40s is actually a brilliant technicolor display of murder mystery, questionable love, youthful rebelliousness, and criminal shenanigans all masquerading as ""film noir"". There is a strong underpinning of homoeroticism in this movie that was probably lost on the 40s audience as well as current ones.  Wendell Corey obviously has the hots for his shady boss John Hodiak who has unrequited feelings for Lizabeth Scott who appears to have more than a daughter-mother relationship with mommy Mary Astor who seems to have more than a passing fancy for sheriff Burt Lancaster who is definitely interested in Lizabeth Scott who isn't sure whether she has feelings for him, Astor, or Hodiak.  All gets resolved?? in the end but there's alot more ""desert fun than fury"" in this quirky merry-go-round of intertwining baddies and goodies. Indeed, there is more fluff than fury to it all and if it weren't for the music score (compliments of the great Miklos Rozsa) there could have been more desert tedium than fury.  Nevertheless, it's worth viewing just for the spectacle of an emotional ""game of musical chairs"", the bravado of Mary Astor (who chews up everyone and every scene she's in), the grimacing John Hodiak, the frustrated Corey and Lancaster (both of whom look like they can't wait to get out of it all and get into their next film, whatever that might be), and the radiant Lizabeth Scott who gets the last laugh and best kiss in the grand finale (no spoilers here).",1330128000,3,1491,4.908730158730159
8278246,4,B001ANWA8G,"Paramount Pictures presents ""DESERT FURY"" (1947) (96 min/Color) -- Starring Lizabeth Scott, John Hodiak, Burt Lancaster, Wendell Corey & Mary Astor

Directed by Lewis Allen

Desert Fury is a rarity for the 1940s, a Technicolor ""film noir."" Set in a Nevada gambling town, the story concerns the various misadventures, romantic and otherwise, of Paula Haller (Lizabeth Scott), the rebellious daughter of gambling-house proprietress Fritzie Haller (Mary Astor). Though no better than she ought to be, Fritzie is determined that Paula will not grow up as a ""shady lady"", but she's fighting an uphill battle. John Hodiak plays crooked gambler Eddie Bendix, who tries to exploit Paula's fascination with him for his own gain. Thank heaven that upright lawman Tom Hanson (Burt Lancaster) is on hand to rescue the heroine from the machinations of Bendix and his partner-in-perfidy Johnny Ryan (Wendell Corey).

Desert Fury was adapted from the far racier and more explicit novel by Ramona Stewart.

Mary Astor and Wendell Corey give outstanding performances in every scene.
Lancaster, Hodiak and Scott are good, but it's Astor and Corey's film.

Outstanding score by the talented composer Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa captures the dark side of the characters within the drama we've labeled ""film noir"".

8278247,4,B001ANWA8G,"After quitting school, a young girl (Lizabeth Scott) returns to her mother (Mary Astor) who runs a gambling casino in a Nevada desert town. When she becomes involved with a racketeer (John Hodiak), several people including Astor, lawman Burt Lancaster and Hodiak's companion (Wendell Corey) attempt to break up the relationship, all for reasons of their own. One of the rare examples of a genuine film noir in color, the film's desert locations reap the greatest benefit of the Technicolor cinematography courtesy of Charles Lang and Edward Cronjager. The most intriguing aspect of the film is the homoerotic relationship between Hodiak and Corey wherein Corey's obsession with Hodiak and his jealousy over Scott threatens to boil over at any minute and in the film's tense finale, it does. Mary Astor as Scott's unyielding mother gives the best performance but the usually wooden Scott manages to drum up enough enthusiasm to actually give a performance. The assured direction is by Lewis Allen (THE UNINVITED) from a screenplay by Robert Rossen based on the novel by Ramona Stewart. Music by Miklos Rozsa.

The DV1 DVD from Australia is a vivid transfer in the proper 1.33 aspect ratio.",1302134400,,1188,5.092307692307692
