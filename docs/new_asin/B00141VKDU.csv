8254121,2,B00141VKDU,"Though this could have been a far more watchable series, the writers invested in a character that destroyed any chance of that, a teenage girl that was not only inappropriate but utterly ridiculous.

I was hoping for a lot more but found it only watchable, not at all memorable.",1222646400,,408,4.453333333333333
