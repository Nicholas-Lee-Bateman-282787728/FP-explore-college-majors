7794027,4,0967554705,"This tape is comprised of three short films that are compelling in a manner that is a bit reminiscent of the early shorts of David Lynch, particularly The Alphabet. Personally, I feel very drawn to art that is  closely derived from the subconscious, though it's hard to articulate the  nature of the attraction or its meaning.  I suppose that, for me, that's  actually a part of the appeal; communication on a level that transcends  spoken and written language, which is exactly what these films accomplish.  There are moments, particularly those involving a whispering voice and a  fascinating recurrent image of a beach house on a rotting platform through  which gently lapping waves below are visible, that create the unsettling  feeling of dreaming though wide awake. This tape will speak with a quiet,  insinuating voice to anyone open to poetic, unconventional filmmaking.",962323200,3,878,5.163120567375887
