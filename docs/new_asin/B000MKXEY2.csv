2736693,5,B000MKXEY2,"I got this DVD to help relieve hip pain and stress, and it absolutely did the trick!  Not only did I feel better after the session, but I gained lots of useful stretches to stay relaxed and prevent future problems.  Eva keeps a great pace for a beginner like me.  She presents the poses clearly and with a wonderful positivity!  Highly recommend this DVD and this series.",1289347200,2,371,4.492537313432836
2736694,5,B000MKXEY2,"I have the other DVD so finding this one was great. I enjoy all her Yoga ""classes"". I like the feeling that she's in the room helping me do my Yoga practice. She's funny but serious.",1265068800,4,182,4.083333333333333
2736695,5,B000MKXEY2,I just love Eva's videos.  She is so charming and friendly.  I always feel like I'm enjoying yoga with a long-time friend.  Her classes are just right - not overly strenuous yet very satisfying and complete.  I get a complete body workout and I have fun as well.  I highly recommend you try Eva's videos.  I'm sure you'll get to like her as much as I do.,1263513600,6,354,4.208955223880597
8169805,5,B000MKXEY2,This is a great DVD for beginners.  She gives such great instruction you don't have to have your eyes on her the whole time.  I find it distracting to have to constantly be watching the instructor when doing yoga DVDs.  It's really hard to find DVDs that provide that level of verbal instruction.  This is a good one.  I really like the sequence of poses as well.  It flows well and is pretty basic; Well worth it for someone who is beginning a yoga practice.,1427587200,,459,4.341176470588235
8169806,5,B000MKXEY2,"This is an incredible DVD! It is the most relaxing thing I have ever experienced!! I use this at night after a hot shower and It makes me sleep like a baby! I am 53 years over and suffer from insomnia often, hormones. I use sleep hypnosis apps downloaded on my ipad/ipod sometimes and they work ok but this works wonderfully everytime! I have even fallen asleep on the floor upon finishing it. The instructor is so calming, i just love it!",1416096000,,439,4.365853658536586
8169807,5,B000MKXEY2,"Eva is one of the best yoga teachers on DVD. In my opinion, she's right up there with Rodney Yee and Erich Schiffmann. She has a way of explaining alignment that allows a deeper understanding of the postures while keeping her approach playful and fun. That said, I've been practicing yoga for nine years and I still find her routines advanced. In ""Hips & Back Bending"" she does a series of sun salutations that include one legged dog into one legged chaturanga that one may need to take a break in the midst of. (Just remember, it's okay to modify and rest when needed.) If you have yoga experience and are looking for great instruction and a challenging but fun yoga practice, you can't go wrong with an Eva Barash DVD.",1337904000,,720,4.5038167938931295
8169808,5,B000MKXEY2,"I have three of the DVD's in the Living Room yoga series (Strengthen and Lengthen/Hips and Backbending/Twist and Bend) and love them all! Eva is low key and personable and her teaching/knowledge of yoga is accessible to me, who can be best described as a casual practitioner (with designs to be more committed!). I don't feel like I have to be an uber-enthusiast to enjoy and benefit tremendously from this practice. It's also perfect because I share a 700 s.f. home with assorted humans, child, dogs, cat, and mice, so the premise of practicing in a small space is appreciated. I'm thinking I need to buy the most recent release as I'm kind of wearing out the three I have on rotation!",1315440000,,686,4.631147540983607
8169809,5,B000MKXEY2,"I'm fairly new to yoga and have taken classes at the gym in the past, however this series of yoga video's have definitely surpassed my expectations.  Living Room Yoga In the Kitchen was a great way to reintroduce a healthy lifestyle, while maintaining relaxation and convenience.  What I wanted was a a quick workout, but what I got was a nutritional wake up call...and for that, I couldn't be happier.  This video is great for beginners, as well as those who are experienced, who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle - both in body and mind.",1291161600,2,542,4.625
8169810,5,B000MKXEY2,"I purchased this DVD during a very stressful time, and Eva's guidance really helped me to relax and refocus my life.  As in her other films, Eva's pacing is great for both advanced and beginning students.  By the end of the session I felt not only relaxed, but also more alert and ready to face the day.

The section of the DVD that deals with nutrition gives great suggestions on how to maintain this focused feeling with optimal diet.  It's a great compliment to the Yoga practice.  I highly recommend this DVD, and this series.",1291075200,2,530,4.536842105263158
8169811,5,B000MKXEY2,"I love all of the DVDs in the Livingroom Yoga series and this one is no exception. I have a stressful job in the financial services industry, which is only getting more stressful, and little time to decide what is best to do in terms of exercise and diet, let alone actually do it. What I like about this DVD is that it provides a gentle yoga workout and great nutritional tips that stick with me and keep me on track.",1290816000,4,418,4.172839506172839
8169812,5,B000MKXEY2,"I've been a fan of Eva's since the first DVD, and she continues to please. This one is great for stretching and working through back pain (one of my problem areas) and for opening up and strenghtening back and hips. . . . Works for me!",1290816000,,235,4.130434782608695
8169813,5,B000MKXEY2,"the thought of yoga in the kitchen caught my attention.  i do yoga which helps me chill out from stress. as a person trying to obsess less (i stress eat alot) about what i eat this approach really works for me! thank you for a great yoga session and healthy food ideas.  the yoga puts me in a more peaceful place and the food tips from lisa the nutritionist help ground me.  having two helpful people reminds me of how important balance is to detoxing my brain & body - great combo for relaxing.  reddy, new york",1290556800,3,512,4.247422680412371
8169814,5,B000MKXEY2,I have the other Livingroom Yoga (dvds)product and Eva continues to deliver! I'm also excited to meet Lisa(the nutritionist) who gives some great ideas on detoxing foods and drinks. I think this is a really good idea to have a dvd that has both food and yoga. I have never seen that before but I like the idea!! I would recommend to anyone going through a hard or stressful time and needing to relax and detox their lives!,1290556800,,422,4.423076923076923
