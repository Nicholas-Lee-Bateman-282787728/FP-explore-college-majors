8653678,5,B00JS3CRVK,"This is a great set! I am thrilled to have these long forgotten TV movies. The quality is good, but don't expect HD since most of these movies were made way before high-def. I was looking for a favorite 'Movie of the Week' called 'Home for the Holidays' with Sally Field, Walter Brennan, Eleanor Parker, Julie Harris and many more familiar faces from the 'ABC Movies of the Week' days. This set is a real treat if you have happy memories of sitting in front of the TV in the 70s and 80s when these types of movies were on three or four times a week on the various channels. Just loved it!",1495584000,,588,4.212389380530974
