8640419,5,B00133F3ZU,"This series follows in a similar vein as that of Evangelion...was seems like a typical mecha anime turns into this emotional, existential journey.  The pain in Zegapain is real, and the progression of the plot is natural and at the end VERY exciting.  Instead of just one or two episodes dealing with the end they have a disk and a half worth of the final confrontation.  Highly recommend this show.",1217116800,5,399,4.671428571428572
