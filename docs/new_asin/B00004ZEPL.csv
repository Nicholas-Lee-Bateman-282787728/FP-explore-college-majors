7928501,4,B00004ZEPL,"This is the 4th out of 6 volumes of the 26 episode series Lost Universe being brought here by ADV Films.
The story in this volume was pretty interesting, one episode actually made my eyes a little watery.  You learn more about Kain's grandmother.  Some soul-searching, some tests of friendship, but it's all good, clean fun.
The thing that really kills me about this DVD is the unstable video quality.  At times, the picture will be amazingly clear and you can see the colors and the lines well.  But the majority of the time, it's blurry and the colors aren't as bright as they should be.  Another thing is that I think 2 times throughout the DVD, I saw this weird line at the bottom of my screen, I'm not sure why it was there but could be from bad transfer or bad masters?
Anyway, my final thought is that I like how we only have to buy 6 DVDs for the 26-episode series as opposed to like 8 DVDs.  Saves money in my pocket and keeps me happy.  Definately try this series out if you have not.  If you liked Slayers or Outlaw Star, you'll probably enjoy this too.",983404800,,1064,4.285
