7786264,5,B01HE3JKI8,High def Todd - just like being there!,1478131200,,38,3.875
7786265,5,B01HE3JKI8,Not sure why they didn't like it. I picked this up and watched it the other night and loved it. Great line up of songs. It's nice to see Todd playing the guitar up close.,1477094400,,170,3.8857142857142857
7786266,1,B01HE3JKI8,"A Blu Ray disc with Dolby Stereo only sound (the worst of all lossy codecs) is like a Tiffany jewelry box containing a nickel plated bracelet from Walmart. It used to be that ""recorded and mixed by Todd Rundgren"" meant something - evidently not so on this hastily produced disc.",1474156800,10,278,4.58
7786267,3,B01HE3JKI8,What I saw was excellent.... but constant dropouts on the brand new disc made it unwatchable. I hope a replacement disc will not have these issues.,1473638400,,147,4.6923076923076925
7786268,5,B01HE3JKI8,"I bought both the CD/DVD and the blu-ray of this (not sure why there wasn't a CD/Blu-Ray package, eliminating the need for 2 purchases?).  This is a pretty satisfying set, and I have pretty much everything Todd has ever done.  I am of the opinion that the Evening With format with Todd & Band is probably the best way to see him, after seeing him in just about every configuration over the last 25 years (including power trio, New Cars, solo piano/guitar, Global w/ dancers, AWATS show, Arena-band, full Nearly Human/2nd Wind soul bands, TR's-Johnson band, etc).  This disc has a very good setlist that is pretty representative of what is performed the last three times Ive seen Todd with Jesse/Prairie/Kasim/John Ferenzik  he does not take requests but has a pretty good feel for what longtime fans want to hear (I myself like the original cuts from Faithful  Black & White and Love of the Common Man, plus Black Mariah, Secret Society, Open My Eyes from the Nazz , plus he started doing Kiddie Boy lately as well, Determination, etc and they're all here  but he did not close this show with Just One Victory as is frequently his custom).  There are more tracks on the DVD/Blu-ray, as the CD has space limitations.  The video concert runs about an hour-50 minutes.

It appears that the sound here is in 2.0 stereo only (I did not find an audio menu plus my remote button did not display any other choices), but the sound is very crisp and the picture is very good.  I was at the LA show at the Saban that happened about 3 weeks after this one (and they also filmed the LA show I attended), but they used the Ridgefield, CT show.  I really wish they'd see if there's anything else he's got that would benefit from a blu-ray release/upgrade (probably the more recent stuff).  The bonuses are 30 minutes of interviews (band members interviewing each other - Todd's and Kas' interviews are quite interesting for Utopia fans) and a couple of minutes of Jesse's guitar stringing/tuning technique.",1473552000,7,1991,4.6571428571428575
7786269,5,B01HE3JKI8,"Todd Rocks this DVD and Cd have great punch! The sound is incredible and I also bought the Blue-Ray version DVD just because it's such a great show! The CD/DVD set has live interviews I don't see listed on the Blue-ray and they are really fun to watch.
This is probably the best live recording I've heard if your a real Todd fan don't pass this up and yes I have them all! Been a Todd fan for forty some years and buy every release without reserve well because that's what real Todd fans do! Can't wait for another Florida Show and it's coming soon!
Thanks Todd,Jessie,Kasim,Prairie and John! See you on the road to Utopia!!!",1473033600,9,625,4.396551724137931
8765188,5,B01HE3JKI8,"I had the opportunity to see Todd Rundgren in 2016 on his tour ""An Evening With Todd Rundgren"".  Having followed his career from the group ""The Nazz"" , artist, guitar player, engineer/producer of many notable artists  and singer as well as computer and media expert I am stunned at his expertise !  This DVD as well as CD gives the purchaser a very good taste of what that tour was about! A must have- as (paraphrased) "" the concert is what he would have played if he  had taken requests..."".",1535500800,,492,4.433333333333334
8765189,5,B01HE3JKI8,"wonderful wide screen picture and good sound quality, but no surround 5.1
 the blu ray disc also plays in region 2 players, unlike amazon's info (again), the concert is great !",1522368000,,176,4.67741935483871
8765190,5,B01HE3JKI8,"Can't lose with Todd, he's on my top 5 list with Bowie!",1520899200,,55,3.6666666666666665
8765191,4,B01HE3JKI8,gift for my husband and he really enjoyed it,1515628800,,44,4.0
8765192,3,B01HE3JKI8,Sound quality is not what I expected. Camera work is also mediocre. Good selections of songs.,1514246400,,93,4.875
8765193,5,B01HE3JKI8,"A lot of tunes and good ones at that, if you are a Todd fan (or not) this is prob his best live DVD release",1512259200,,107,3.32
8765194,4,B01HE3JKI8,If your a Todd fan you will like it in some spots the audio mix was weak. But still worth veiwing,1509926400,,97,3.6666666666666665
8765195,5,B01HE3JKI8,"As a lifelong TR fan, I was very excited to meet him for the first time on this past  Monday when he performed at the Ridgefield Playhouse again. I had visited the Playhouse earlier this year for a Dweezil Zappa show, and fell in love with the venue , so I planned another trip from Chicago to enjoy
an Unpredictable Evening With Todd Rundgren...sadly, I broke my toe and could not travel.....the folk at the Playhouse were very sympathetic and arranged a picture of todd holding a picture of me ...some small comfort, but the real treat is discovering this show,. which I was unaware of til about an hour ago browsing  PRIME VIDEO....awesome venue and great setlist for those who need the hits.....Don't miss his White Knight tour later this/next year.....",1505865600,,757,4.7272727272727275
8765196,3,B01HE3JKI8,"This is a really good album, Todd is one of the best ever ! The younger generation is listening to crap at this point and should listen to some of the masters.",1504742400,,159,4.0
8765197,5,B01HE3JKI8,Todd id God. Great performance.,1491264000,,31,5.4
