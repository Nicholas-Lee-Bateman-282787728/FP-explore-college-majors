5058666,2,B0076YFKZS,"I am a Dementia Specialist Consultant. I specialize in Alzheimer's Dementia, how to avoid it, how to recognize the early signs and how to compassionately care for the diagnosed patient through proper training and support of the family and caregivers. Therefore, I am constantly looking for evidence based research that can make my training sessions more useful and effective.

I bought this DVD knowing nothing about Dr. Leaf. I was generally pleased with her introductory material. However, the longer I watched her presentation, the more small, yet significant errors I found. The first thing I noticed was a graphic that was misleading in the way it was labeled. See included picture. The Dendrite Label is pointing to the neuron cell!  It is completely wrong! Then there were statements that are highly debatable, though not stated as such and there were statements as fact that just are not true. One such statement was that ""the average person only uses .001% of their brain."" We use all of it, just not at the same time. Therefore, we do not have 99%+ of our brain sitting idle waiting for something to fill it up.

Having noticed several problems as above, I started looking into Dr. Leaf's background. Therein, I believe is the  reason that inaccuracies were included in this presentation. I could find nothing in her background that showed she has current academic training in neuroscience.

The human brain is the most complicated system ever witnessed by man. We have learned more about it in the last 10 years than we knew in the previous 90 years. Still, we do not know how it works to the point that we can say we totally understand it. Ten years ago, I might not have thought too much about a few inaccuracies in this video. However, today we are faced with a growing epidemic, Alzheimer's, that is going to bankrupt the healthcare systems of the world. We must learn how the brain functions in order to prevent mass collapse of modern society. With the projected increase in longevity, it is estimated that 50% of the modern world's population will have Alzheimer's Disease by age 80. Teaching about the brain is important, from street level, everyday persons to our most trusted medical advisors. Publishing or presenting inaccuracies is not something we have the luxury of going back and changing when the facts are already out there.

There are several important issues that Dr. Leaf addresses in this video and most of it is accepted as being useful and correct. Therefore, if you just want to watch a pleasant presentation and pick up a few hints on how to perhaps protect or improve your brain function, then you will probably enjoy this video. If you are looking for cutting edge information and accuracy, I would not recommend this. I suggest you look at material by Robert. M Sapolsky, Ph. D.,
John Medina, Ph. D., V.S. Ramachandran, Ph. D. and Paul Nussbaum, Ph. D.. These and more, are trained in the science of the brain, are on the cutting edge of how the brain works and how you can support maximum brain function.

I respect Dr. Leaf for her knowledge and effort to educate the masses. I just wish she had used a proper medical editor and fact checker. I would like to see her revise her presentation in the near future.
