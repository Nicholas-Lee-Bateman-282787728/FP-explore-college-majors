8142490,5,B000HY12EW,"In this collection released in the year 2000 we're treated to a series of comedy music videos from Ray Stevens focusing on several songs that his fans over the years had requested he do music videos on. First and foremost is ""The Blue Cyclone""...and from that music video comes the still picture of Ray in a headlock. Portraying the part of the wrestler is Ray's songwriting and business partner, Buddy Kalb. The music video is broken into two parts just like the original song from 1985. Part 1 kicks off the home video and it ends with Part 2. Sandwiched between Parts 1 and 2 of the video are six additional music videos.

1. The Blue Cyclone, Part 1
2. Virgil and the Moonshot
3. Juanita and the Kids
4. Too Drunk To Fish
5. The Haircut Song
6. The Pirate Song
7. Freddie Feelgood
8. The Blue Cyclone, Part 2

Most of these music videos have been uploaded onto You Tube. His You Tube name is raystevensmusic and of the music videos on this collection only 1, 5, 6, and 8 have not been uploaded yet. This means videos 2 through 4 and video 7 are available for official on-line viewing. I bought this collection 11 years ago when it was brand new and back when there wasn't such a thing as You Tube. This is the collection to get if you want these music videos in one collection.",1320278400,,1281,4.333333333333333
