7899737,3,7302172331,"I just watched this movie on the Western Channel (Encore Westerns) and would not recommend that anyone spend more than $5.00 for a DVD of it.  The acting was OK.  I thought Anhony Quinn played an interesting part and did it well and Franco Nero did well in his part too.  The story was just ""ok"", but not very realistic.  Historically, it was a disaster!  Remember, this movie time frame is 1836 to 37 or so.  Most revolvers were Colt 1851 Navies with a few Colt 1873 SAA cartridge revolvers here and there!  The first revolver was invented by Samual Colt in 1836 and first went into production in that year.  Unfortunately, no Paterson Colts were in the movie, and working replicas were available in 1972.  The Texas Rangers did use the Paterson Colt in the later part of the 1830s but few people would have had them.  The Gatling Gun brought there by the Germans (I didn't check into German intervention in Texas at this time) was not invented until 1861 by Richard Gatling (not a German) and first saw service during the time of the Civil War.  Much dynamite was used in the movie.  Dynamite was invented by a German, in 1867!  I fully expected to see someone pull out a Winchester Repeating Rifle, but no one did!  I'm sure I saw some in saddle scabbards but when anyone fired a rifle they were single shot percussion rifles.  I know that these historical details would mean little to some people but if one is going to put a historical time frame in a movie, one should stick to historical facts.  Had the equipment available in the 1830s been used in the movie it would have changed much of the activities seen in the movie and given more credit to the efforts required by those people in the movie.",1396224000,2,1705,4.451612903225806
