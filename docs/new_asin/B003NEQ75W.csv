4157395,1,B003NEQ75W,"I purchased this Blue Ray edition hoping it has a better transfer. Not at all.  The movie lacks any special features and the transfer is VERY BAD.  Even a video cassette would look better as the images are grainy and colors fade.  I don't know why movie studios care to release such a BAD product hoping to take advantage of fans who wanted a better looking product. You don't need it, better buy it on DVD and there will be NO difference among both versions.",1318809600,17,459,4.376470588235295

These Midnight Madness Series of BR are such a HUGE let down
I guess Anchor Bay isn't gonna Transfer all that Great Horror Catalog to BR
So ether Image bought the rights or
Image is a sister company of Anchor Bay/Starz
Not sure  what ever the case these Transfer are bottom or barrel quality
Uncompressed PCM Mono WTF!!!!!

It's nothing more then a grift for quick cash for die hard Horror fans!
I'll admit they got me good (Sold my Special Edition Dvd's to Replace with the BR's) Now i have to purchase the S.E. Dvd's again
Great thanks IMAGE
1st Hellraiser II was bare (The Transfer wasn't bad even though Anchor Bay would have done much better all of Anchor Bays extras were no where to be found )

The Same with Both Vamp & Dead Heat

All the great extras of VAMP from the Special Edition dvd
have been left back?????
I have No clue why

If you are a huge fan of Vamp and want the Ultimate BR Collection snatch up a Copy of
Arrow's BR Import of Vamp (It's awesome has lots of cool extras. Content made for Arrow's BR Cut)

Avoid this version get the Import (It's Region free)
  The Film is Ahead of it's time so good and unique

4157398,1,B003NEQ75W,"So if you're not going to invest any time into a release, why even bother? The DVD that was previously released a few years ago actually had a decent amount of special features. This release? Not ONE. NOTHING. They couldn't even put those on this release? The only thing that the BluRay did better is spell Dedee Pfeiffer's name correctly on the front cover.

If you want just the movie, this would be fine for you. If you want a decent release with some really cool special features, try to track down the original DVD release, or if you already have it, don't bother ""upgrading""...",1316476800,11,583,4.552380952380952
4157399,5,B003NEQ75W,"Yes, I'm reviewing an extras-loaded blu ray edition of a film barely anyone has ever seen, especially if you were born after the 80's horror heydays!  I am so pleased to have found this gem at AmazonUK.com on blu ray, with brand new special features, cheap, and on a region free disc courtesy of Arrow Video.

Firstly, the film itself is pure fun horror-comedy.  It never takes itself too seriously, but doesn't skimp on the villains ability to kill, bite, and tear the hero's limb from limb.  This is basically the same premise of Martin Scorsese's great black comedy After Hours mixed with EC style vampirism, and John Hughes-like teen comedy.  And it totally works.  Hell even a star of John Hughes' Sixteen Candles(Gedde Wantanabbe) plays one of the main characters.  The big draw of this film at the time, at least for the low budget studio behind the film, was getting Grace Jones to play the main vampire Goddess Katrina.  She was showcased in all the tv adds and most of the poster artwork.  Was it worth it?  HELL YEAH!  While she has little-to-no dialogue in the film she is quite striking while she is on screen.  Even without her Nosferatu-inspired vampire make up on she's still strange and menacing.  Plus, she has one of the most interesting and weird strip-teases ever committed on film.  This film has a similar tone to the equally great Fright Night.  If you dug that one, you may just be seduced by Vamp.

Now onto the new Blu ray.  It is really good with only minor complaints.  The transfer is probably as great as it's ever going to be.  Even better than the already very good Anchor Bay release.  There's some grain scattered about, the film takes place mostly at night.  But the very EC/early Dario Argento-inspired light schemes that dominate the second and third acts of the film are even more striking in Hi-Definition.  It's worth the upgrade for sure.

The brand new special features are great as well.  We get a new audio commentary featuring co-star Robert Rusler(Weird Science, A Nightmare on Elm. Street 2) and film critic Calum Waddell(he's written pieces for Fangoria magazine).  They seem like old pals and laugh it up as they talk about what's on screen.  We also get some scandalous details regarding Rusler's night life while working on the film accompanied by Grace Jones, and a great story about how Dolph Lundgren wanted to kick his butt.  ""Vamp it up-Dedee Pfeiffer Remembers the After Dark Club"" is a talking heads interview with the actress with footage, behind the scenes and other, cut into her conversation(which is the case for all the special features).  It's fun and she comes off very personable and cute.  Makes one wish that she showed up in more stuff.  The last time I saw her in anything outside of her Playboy pics(which if you haven't already, check them out immediately) is that horrible sitcom Cybil.  Next we get ""Vamp Stripped Bare-an interview with Richard Wenk"" a great piece talking to the director about his inspirations and the wranglings it took to make the film and keep Grace Jones on set.  This feature does repeat some of the next features material, ""Back to the 80'S-Producing a Campy Cult Classic that interviews producer Peter Borscher.  This is the best of the interview section of special features in my opinion.  It goes over all the details of how the film got off the ground, the actual production, and the release and eventual cult status of the film.  Most interestinly is Borscher's story about how he was approached in the 90's by Robert Kurtzman(the K in KNB Effects) and then unknown Quentin Tarantino about a script they wanted him to produce called From Dusk 'Til Dawn.  They wanted him to produce the film just so they could avoid legal problems with the fact that both films had very similar premises, but really are nothing alike in the long run.  He did produce Dusk.  Never knew that.  Borscher isn't dry and talks straight to the point.  ""Scrapbook of Scares"" is a fun featurette with director Wenk showing off some of the memorabilia he kept from the Vamp shoot.  It's neat and worth a look.  We also get rehearsal footage, bloopers, original theatrical trailer, and Richard Wenk's student film Dracula Bites the Big Apple-all of which were ported over from the original Anchor Bay DVD release.

You also get a double sided poster featuring brand artwork for the film.  The Blu Ray sleeve itself is really fun.  You can flip it to appear as any poster design you prefer.  There's the two new artworks, which is what the double-sided poster consists of, or two original posters.  Very neat.  Finally, you get a 7 page booklet featuring an essay by critic Jay Slater that is fun and nostalgia fueled recollection of a film he obviously loves.

Now the only downside of this package that I can muster is the abscence of the Anchor Bay DVD's audio commentary featuring stars Mark Makepeace, Dedee Pfeiffer and director Richard Wenk.  I'm assuming it was a rights issue and the commentary strictly belongs to Anchor Bay, otherwise I can't think of a good reason not to include it.  If you can pick up a copy of the American DVD release, it's worth a listen.  But that's it.  I'm a very happy customer with a film that I've loved since gradeschool.

The mid to late 80's birthed a lot of suped up and alternative vampire flicks.  Vamp, The Lost Boys, Near Dark and my personal favorite Fright Night(which now that it's being remade the chances of that classic getting a special edition blu ray are very good-YAY) all had one thing in common beyond the time period that they were made, they involved teenagers as their main characters.  How else in the 80's would dusty old and totally been-done-to-death horror characters such as vampires be relevant and more importantly profitable.  This films I mentioned were all good films to boot.  So enjoy....this movie doesn't SUCK.",1300665600,10,5864,4.738142292490118

4157439,4,B003NEQ75W,"This 80s film wears well. Two college students, Robert Rusler and Montreal-born Chris Makepeace, along with a companion of convenience (Watanabe) get into un-deadly hijinks when trying to gain entry to a frathouse by providing adult entertainment to their initiators by visiting a seemingly mundane but unusual exotic club featuring Grace Jones, who only opens her mouth to bite and even bark. In fact, except for a waitress who recognizes Rusler and Makepeace from a brief encounter years before, the whole staff is vampiric. The club owner, a Sopranos-type, is given particularly good dialogue and even, in context, some ""believability."" There are thrills, some blood and some violence, but they are delivered with a certain retraint, at least considering the protagonists' youth. Except for Jones, none of the actors seems to have expanded much beyond this opus: Rusler did not become deservedly better-known, and the then-popular Makepeace has, according to Wikipedia, disappeared behing the camera.",1419897600,,1003,5.47741935483871

Grace Jones gives a great performance as the head vampire in this one and boy does she make a mean vampire.  This reminds me a lot of Fright Night that it has its comedy moments, but is a good vampire movie.  My wife at first was not even interested in watching it even though she likes vampire movies and at the end, it ended up being one of her favorites now.  This one is now among my favorites as well.  It has the good classic 80s roots and styles that made it such a good era of horror movies.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but check it out!",1414972800,,666,4.0

4157457,4,B003NEQ75W,"It's good to be able to get hold of a quality DVD of this after years of trying to catch it on TV. I first saw this as a youngster and while it hasn't stood the test of time perfectly, it's still an imaginative and original comedy horror caper.

Grace Jones, one suspects, was one of the central selling points for the film originally, but while she does a fine job (mostly non-speaking) of leading a coven of blood sucking harpies, it's other elements of the film that hold the attention. The set design and lighting are both imaginative. It might not be the only film from the 1980s to have used pink and green neon lights, but it's certainly a fine example of how to make the city by night even more alien and disorientating.

Following on from this, the way the neighbourhood around the After Dark club is set up as something of a world unto itself is a nice touch. The seedy hotel, the diner, the grungy street gangs who somewhat confusingly seem to be both vampires and in conflict with vampires at the same time... Taking this further, the vampires' backstory is mentioned in a scene towards the end of the film, although like the characters, is never really properly developed.

Still, the film has at least some kind of, er, logic to it. Vamp is mainly about visual style, and when you add in the fact that Keith Haring contributed to the look of some of the club scenes (Grace Jones' body paint), it's fair to say that this is a quintessential 80s horror film: All fangs and no knickers!",1375574400,,1497,4.4363636363636365
4157458,5,B003NEQ75W,"Two college friends Keith(Chris Makepeace) and AJ (Robert Rusler) want to be in a fraternity but in order to be in they have to get a stripper for them for a party. They bring along a rich student named Duncan (Geedee Wantanabe) for the ride to the big city to go to a special strip-club called ""The After Dark Club"" where there are plenty of beautiful women especially Keith's old girlfriend Armaretto (Deedee Pfeifer) whom he hasn't seen in a long time. The club is owned by the desirable Katrina (Grace Jones) who is an Egyptian vampiress as it turns out the club is full of vampires who drink the blood of many people as the trio with Armaretto must battle the undead of the night.

A very entertaining 1986 cult horror comedy cult classic from director and co-writer Richard Wenk! What began as a concept by Donald Borchers who is the producer of this film as he worked for New World Pictures in 1985 who had an idea for a film about college students vs. stripper vampires, Richard Wenk came off his hit short film ""Dracula Bites the Big Apple"" in 1979 as he was seeking something of a debut film and this was his chance. It did became a minor hit and gained a cult following since it's video release, what works in this charming horror comedy is the atmosphere with some dark humor. The acting is quite good even by Robert Rusler and Grace Jones is terrific as the title villainess as she is one of those singers who can act playing the seductive Katrina. Deedee Pfeifer is beautiful in this movie as i always had a thing for her since i saw this movie in theaters as a kid when i lived in St. Louis and she is indeed Michelle's sister, Billy Draco is good in the role of the psycho albino gang leader Snow and there's good and sometimes gory vampire make-up effects by Greg Cannom even with Katrina's transformation from stripper to vampire queen as her character is a bit like Orloff from Nosferatu in some way but as a female version. This movie pre-dates films like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Bordello of Blood"" years before them with the similar concepts and all, it even ahsa  good score by Jonathan Elias which sounds kind of Carpenter-esque in some ways and this is one of my favorite vampire films.

This blu-ray R0 UK import from Arrow Films is an excellent BD and what some people here in the US don't realize that some foreign BDS mainly ones from the UK can play on US based players sometimes and this is one of them that plays on all regions. The picture quality is great with exceptionally crisp coloring that make the colors pop out and great extras like interview with Deedee Pfeifer (not in the US DVD), new interview with Richard Wenk, new commentary by Robert Rusler and critic Calum Waddell plus booklet with info on the film with collector's poster, 4 panal reversible sleeve options with new artwork and original posters, intro by Robert Rusler, Back o the 80s an interview with the producer, scrapbook of Scares which has Richard Wenk look over his collection of Vamp memorabilia, easter egg, behind the scenes rehearsals, blooper reel, Dracula Bites the Big Apple short film by Richard Wenk and Trailer. A definite must own for fans of the film and for fans of vampire films but please AVOID the US Image company version which is crappy as it has zero extras and bad PQ as this is the only one to get.
