Watching this video brings back with those memories, albeit with some disappointment.  I still find watching those races enjoyable, and excellent trainer material.",1425772800,,301,5.543478260869565

7834048,5,6302993601,"I really enjoyed this 2  hour highlight film of Lance Armstrongs first 6  Tour de France championship rides. You obviously get only the highlights over a 20 minute program for each race , along  with some  tasty interview segments. This DVD has now been usurped by the Lance Armstrong 7 ""sampler"" from World Cycling which is the highlight DVD of 150 minutes and covers all 7. You may have to visit the world cycling productions site  to order it but its [...] so you get all this plus 30 minutes from 2005!",1247961600,5,506,4.456521739130435

The weather won't let me ride outside in this part of the country due to all this darn snow and the temp is going down to over twenty below tonight.

You can't help but to increase your cadence.  Lance may not ever come back, but I have him forever, in his prime, on DVD!  Wish it was Hi-Def but common it's the Tour, they are lucky to just get a TV signal out half the time.  Don't get me wrong the digital video quality of this DVD is fine.  Enjoy it!!!",1231891200,3,983,5.38562091503268
