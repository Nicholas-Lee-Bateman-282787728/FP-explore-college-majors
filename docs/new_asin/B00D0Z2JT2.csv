5766216,5,B00D0Z2JT2,Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods is a great DBZ film. I've really missed it. If you're planning on buying this just buy it from Amazon. Co. Jp. Go for the Limited Edition Blu Ray Steel Book Case Version. Comes with all the Limited Edition stuff + A Steel Book Exclusive only to the Amazon Site. It'll be like around $113.00 more or less. I think it's worth it. Japanese Blu Rays will work on U.S. Blu Ray players. They have the same Region Code. DvD's have different region codes and U.S. and Japan don't share the same one. Just buy it off the Japanese Amazon site on Blu Ray. That's what I did. Hope this helps. And I forgot. IT COMES OUT THIS FRIDAY!!! CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE IT!!!!!!!!,1378771200,8,681,4.246153846153846
5766217,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"Standard DVDs are $40 on amazon japan + 20 something for shipping overseas, this movie will be released stateside but Funimation does not expect anything earlier than 2014 and probably late 2014.
Personally I do not care for the English dub and will just use subs when available.

I pre-ordered the limited edition which came to a total of $108.45 which includes $20.08 shipping, the standard blu-ray would cost $37.14 + $20.08 which is $57.22.
I ordered the limited steelbook version from Amazon, not the regular limited edition, there's a $30 difference.

The movie itself is good, but ordering anything from Japan be it dragonball or any other franchise is not cheap, they are not in a recession like the states.",1378684800,3,715,4.900826446280992

This is not a Region 1 dvd, this is the japanese version of Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods. It is only coming out on DVD on 9/13/2013 as of now.

5766229,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"Spoilers: This movie was particularly good because of how it deviated from the typical DBZ story arc. The enemy didn't end up being your stereotypical arch-villain, and this made the movie all the more interested.",1508803200,,213,5.114285714285714

5766243,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"Strange movie. Not what I expected it was gonna be. I think this is a film meant to be enjoyed by fans that are very familiar with the franchise, otherwise someone new to it would be left confused what's going on. I was thinking at the beginning that this could have been an interesting prospect, a new threat to be introduced in it's own 20, or 30 episode saga, but I'm glad it was kept short if this was the kind of writing. The writing felt kind of like a fan-fiction/TV special, that stayed pretty true to the Dragon Ball universe, but there were some awkwardness to the dialog and slight out of character moments.
I even felt the same with the new antagonist, even though this the first time getting familiar with the character, you're already given a sense early on of this creatures habits, but felt convent to change it's routine at this moment and slightly forced to push the scene to get himself where Goku is. Lacked some organic flow. Granted, there is only so much pacing one can do in ONE feature film, to do what Dragon Ball is know to take a span of a few seasons. That is just my taste however.
Also with the antagonist, I can tell they tried to make him quarky, there's noting wrong with that, In fact I'd welcome a character with some personality. I would make sense with the lifestyle he leads that there would be a bit of eccentric behavior. I feel however they kind of over did it. One thing I can appreciate however, is they omitted the Dragon Ball GT lore, thank goodness for that.",1481328000,,1505,4.378571428571429

Battle of Gods took everything that DB fans love (the characters, the jokes, and the awesome fights) and combined it into a nice comeback for Goku and the crew. For those who have seen Dragon Ball Z, this picks up shortly after the Buu Saga.

5766360,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"Battle of Gods takes place after the Boo Saga but before the final episode of Dragon Ball Z. Unlike most other previous movies, this one was designed by series creator Akira Toriyama to be an official continuation of the manga and anime. An ancient god, Beerus, comes to Earth in search of a person he saw in his dream: the Super Saiyan God.

This film is fan-service for older Dragon Ball fans. It is not a good place to start the series if you're new to Dragon Ball. In fact, most of the movie is nostalgia-pandering, with numerous filler-type scenes of classic characters (Hercule, Dr. Briefs, Pilaf, and Oolong get extended screen time). It's nice to see so many faces make an appearance and I enjoyed these scenes immensely. But while they were great fan-service they severely detracted from the pacing of the film.

The film is kind of in the tone of the oldest Dragon Ball episodes, where comedy was more important than action. In fact, there's not too much action in the movie, but when it does show up, it's very well animated, setting the precedent for the gorgeous fight scenes in the next film, Resurrection of F.

I did not like the look of Beerus or his attendant Whis. The Super Saiyan God form is also disappointing visually. Bruce Faulconer is missed as the series composer.",1446422400,,1291,4.62882096069869

The fighting scenes and humor were great, just as one would expect from Dragon Ball, but my main problem with it is the plot. Although the Dragon Ball series doesn't exactly have the deepest plot ever, I did expect a bit more from Battle of Gods. The villains just kind of show up, and there isn't much backstory on them. My expectations for this movie were a bit higher, but we can just hope that Dragon Ball Super ends up being much better.",1440979200,,520,4.262626262626263

5766437,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"'Battle of Gods' per say wasn't focused in fighting which honestly, I quite enjoyed it because in comparison to 'Resurrection F' it was a breath of fresh air and had a variety of comedy, drama and battle thrown in. The Pilaf gang was easily my favourite part aside from Vegeta the Singer, and yeah sure, it was pretty cool to see Son Goku turn to a Super Saiyan God but it frankly didn't wow me at all although, I don't mind since the best chunks of Goku's evolutions were 2, 3 and 4. I would have included Kaioh-ken but Kaioh-ken is a power-up whereas the Super Saiyan forms are evolutions. So I suppose the Kaioh-ken power-up might be the reason why I wasn't very impressed with the Super Saiyan God form.

Well, now as for the Japanese Special Edition Blu-ray that I bought last year, it came with what you see on the product picture (minus the 13 cards -- Bummer) it was a very meaty package but I won't be importing another one again. I'll rather just wait for FUNimation to release it (I don't mind that it's stripped down to the movie only and no physical bonuses).

Anyhow, it's a pretty great Dragon Ball Z movie, that is to say, if you also enjoyed Dragon Ball otherwise you won't like it as much because it's not fighting-focused.",1440547200,,1241,4.414847161572053

5766458,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"Spoiler Alert!!!

PROS: The movie portrays our hero actually congregating & enjoying peace time, instead of fighting.  We get to see the lighter tone of Vegeta!

CONS: Little action.  Don't get me wrong, the action is actually pretty cool -- Watching Goku become a Super Saiyan God.  But the antagonist, is not actually a BAD guy, just looking for a challenge.",1439424000,,360,4.836065573770492
5766459,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"Watched this before taking the family to see Resurrection F on the big screen. Both were enjoyable, but I actually liked this one better. It has a lighthearted tone that has been missing from the series for a long time. Sure it has an epic battle between unimaginably powerful fighters with the fate of the world at stake, but it places just as much importance on delicious food and ridiculous humor. Resurrection F is weighted in a more serious direction with certain characters returning as comic relief, but in Battle of the Gods all the different elements are blended perfectly to create a seamless, thoroughly enjoyable ride. I definitely recommend the uncut version. I'm not sure exactly what the differences are, but I know the theatrical version is 20 minutes shorter, and I wouldn't have wanted to miss any of this.",1439424000,,824,4.851063829787234
5766460,4,B00D0Z2JT2,Great movie. Everything I expected and more,1439424000,,43,5.285714285714286
5766461,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"In a nutshell:

This is classic Dragon Ball Z along with a dash of a fresh new style to it. This movie is very good in reintroducing you back into the Dragon Ball Z world, it finds the perfect spot to bring back the gang and surprise you with new characters. Overall, very fun movie with a surprise cast along the way.

The nitty-gritty:

I really enjoyed this, I was thinking it was going to blow super sand (inside joke) but it was pretty good. Sure it wasn't over 9,000! but it was off the scales in my book. The animation was clean but at the same time retained some of its old style. If you are a dragon ball fan, you have to check this out. I have seen all of the episodes and movies, and I was actually a little surprised that I missed this one, such is the way of life and being an adult, responsibilities just creep up on you.

Anyways, back to the movie. This brings back the entire cast and begins to lead you to the most current release of Dragon Ball Z  Resurrection of F. I am going to avoid spoilers as I am sure there are many other nerds that cant wait to go super sand and go insayan on you. Take my word on it, watch it and then go watch Resurrection F (I saw it in the theaters, review coming soon).

In case any of you have no idea what I am talking about, go watch Dragonzball P (yes it is a parody) but it is die hard hilarious, so stop acting dominion Virginia!

When an old series releases new content like this, most people automatically dismiss it as new age s*** and don't bother with it, but I figured I'd give it a chance. The entire time that I was watching it I had a hardon, which was awkward because I had to try and hide it from all of my friends. Seriously though, this movie struck the perfect balance between the badass fight scenes of dragon ball z with the humor and lighthearted attitude of dragon ball.

5766487,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"This movie was awesome!  It's nice to have the original creator of Dragon Ball come back with something that feels like it picked up right after DBZ not GT.  Some people on here are complaining about it ""moving slow.""  I wonder if they remember watching Dragon Ball Z?  It does move slow, but the well written dialogue and comedic moments make up for it.  Definite must see for anyone planning to watch Resurrection 'F'.  Love Lord Beerus and Weis.

I don't want to give away the plot, best to watch it for yourself, but for anyone thinking it may move too slow I leave you with this joke:

Question:  How many DBZ characters does it take to screw in a light bulb?

Although I do really appreciate the nods to Dragon Ball (which is much better than BDZ imo). Emperor Pilaf and his cronies are nostalgic tokens and do provide some humor. Besides this, lots of pointless filler.

Spoiler alert:
I am most upset with Goku being out of character. He is presented as some prideful fighter that cares more about fighting on his own strength than he does about his family, friends, and the whole earth. Its not like him at all. He told Frieza that he was the hope of the universe. Also, he would never give up. He would fight until he killed. But here he just gives up and doesn't care at all about his family. That isn't the pure hearted Goku that makes the whole Dragonball franchise good in my opinion.",1438646400,,864,4.4

5766562,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"This was a very entertaining film with a number of time-capsule-like parts (that made you look back at the good ol days of the Dragonball franchise) and incredible animation! I don't even think the 400 episodes of the show combined could match that movie's animation! There were a lot of hilarious moments (surprisingly). One thing though, keep in mind the ""Battle of Gods"" doesn't really happen until the last 20 minutes. Thankfully there's plenty of entertainment before it (I thought it was worth it).

The villain (Beerus) in my opinion, is the best DBZ villain since Cell. With goofy looking villains like Frieza & Buu (and being taken so seriously) it was great to get a more ""self aware"" type that has a sense of humor.

Overall, I had a blast watching it. Another movie (Resurrection F) is coming this August; if one of the select theaters happens to be near me, I'll gladly watch it there.",1433203200,,898,4.713375796178344

5766565,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"I loved this movie. Quite a few people have told me the movie was tasteless to them as DBZ fans and I have to disagree. The movie starts with some light comedy, into drama, suspense and then a large fight. It's basically any saga from DBZ rolled in to a movie. No saga started as pure action, so why should the movie?

I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.",1433030400,,358,3.9722222222222223
5766566,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"Loved it!

For the people that thought Lord Beerus didn't seem like a ""destructor"" I say he sure did have a character for it. If you are the most powerful being in the universe you are allowed to throw tantrums if you desire. Also just his character alone was very funny, typical ""God"" like humor.

Sure the fight scene could of been better and maybe longer but I was never a huge fan of the 60 minute episodes where it shows Goku powering up. Nobody wants to waste time on that anymore.. Good for them for adding more story and drama.

Would be nice to see a follow up on this, Goku and Lord Beerus make a very interesting pair. Both funny and amusing.

Well I hope you decide to watch and if you don't like it, well sucks for you.",1433030400,,732,4.170212765957447

5766578,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"For being Dragon Ball Z and having the word ""battle"" in the title, I felt it could have used some more fighting. But then, at the level things are, most of the fighters have no business in combat, so it's not as though they could have contributed much if anything. Still, even Goku didn't have much time punching. There is a subplot going on that I think could have been better used to build tension for the main fight. Tension was something sorely lacking, and without that, it's hard to really get into it. Even the fabled Super Saiyan God form was a bit of a let down. Almost a footnote, really, and barely given any screen time.
What was there, though was good. There were some good jokes, and the animation was well done. What combat there was was brisk and free of much of the posturing and screaming that stretched out the series.
Overall, an enjoyable movie, but not as exciting as I was hoping for.
The language is a bit stronger than in the series but there's not much of it and it goes by quickly. The rating says TV-PG, but some parents might want to watch it first if they are worried about that sort of thing.",1431734400,,1123,4.327014218009479

The thing that surprised me was the humor in the movie.  I actual laughed out loud at multiple different points, somethign I don't recall being so prominent in the series.

5766706,2,B00D0Z2JT2,"I will start out by saying how incredibly disappointed I am with this movie. I have been a fan of DBZ since I was a kid so when I heard about this movie I was excited. However, after watching it I have to say I was let down. The movie centers around Beerus the Destroyer who by title only would lead you to believe he is a devastating character. While he is very powerful, he turns out to be far from a ""destroyer"". The movie starts very slow and drags through half the movie before there is a fight scene. Finally when the fighting begins it is over in a matter of minutes. Vegetas character is not the one fans remember either. Not only does he practically grovel in fear at Beerus, there is even a scene where he dances! Not the Vegeta we all grew to love throughout the DBZ series. Finally Goku arrives to save the day and he and Beerus finally fight. The fight lasts about 10-15 minutes. For a movie that is an hour and fourty five minutes long there is maybe 30 minutes of combat max throughout the movie. The ending was probably the worst part of this train wreck and the last ten minutes of the movie left me staring at the screen in disbelief. This movie is packed with useless filler and minimal fighting. The ""villian"" ends up being far from what you would expect. And beloved characters are virtually stripped of the personality that made them so great. The current generation animation was the only good thing about this movie. Overall very disappointed in this catastrophe. Funimation should be embarrassed with putting out this product.",1421107200,,1551,4.4840989399293285

5766718,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"As a Dragon Ball Z fan in the nineties, I eagerly anticipated this release and willingly paid the $4 for a sub par storying telling and a jolt of action. Definitely a nostalgia trip. I have two reviews, one for the DBZ fan and one for the non DBZ fan.

For the Non-DBZ Fan:
Dragon Ball Z's (DBZ's) big selling point is the over the top action and fighting. There are some memorable characters, and from time to time the show has some decent story telling. That said, if this is one of your first times watching DBZ, DO NOT START with this movie. This is not DBZ at its finest and does more so to pay fan service and capitalize on the existing fan base.

For the DBZ Fan:

Storytelling:
Now I know DBZ is better known for its over the top testosterone fueled battles. However, the original DBZ series (and movies) had some decent story telling along the way.

You have one movie where you find out how (Cell Games, adult) Trunks gets his sword...I consider one of the finest DBZ stories. And you have the action packed but almost plotless DBZ movie where Vegeta and Goku learn to perform fusion (alternate) and fight a really bad a$$ underworld baddie. In between you have ""Cell Games"" saga in the series with a mix of both story telling, action and a bunch of filler. Watching this movie is like jumping in and watching a sub par Cell Games episode. Why?

*You really do have to know the backstory to really enjoy it. In this movie's case, know a bit about all the characters, otherwise you just watch a barrage of characters take up minutes of the movie.

(Spoiler Alert Start)
*The action is fun but almost not enjoyable because of how powerful the ""bad guy"", Beers, is and how predictable Goku is. Beers makes me question how powerful any of the DBZ or DBGT bad guys are. If Goku couldn't defeat Evil Majin Buu, Baby or Omega Shenron, I'm sure Beers could do it in a heartbeat.
(Spoiler Alert End)

Animation
Despite the advances in animation, DBZ only goes so far as to have clean computer generated animation. In this way it still is true to the original (animated) series, paying homage to animation rather than joining the third dimension a la so many of the DBZ video games of the last several years.

In sum, DBZ Battle of the Gods is worth watching for the DBZ fan. However, it really does feel like a feature length film filler in between DBZ and DBGT.",1420156800,,2363,4.416091954022988

Over all, I recommend it if you are a fan of DBZ!",1420156800,,304,4.083333333333333
5766721,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"ok, before you read my review I warn those who don't want to read spoilers,to stop now because there are a few in my review. Ok so here goes, The movie is weird in the way it delivers its contents, but enjoyable and at times, down right cheesy, it balances adult themes like master roshi being a nasty dirty pervert, which is funny but Im not sure if it is child appropriate, but that is for the parents to decide. **************here comes the spoiler**********

I like the way they set it up for future  new episodes or movies, Lord Beerus revealed that he wasn't the strongest and that there was 12 dimensions with even stronger fighters, Which gives goku to opportunity to potentially reach new levels of power beyond God mode. I cant wait to see what happens",1420156800,2,762,4.5144927536231885
5766722,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"Yo, this movie is dope. Definitely worth the watch if you're a DBZ head like me. 5/5",1420070400,,84,4.0
5766723,1,B00D0Z2JT2,"Dragon Ball Z: the Battle of Gods is the biggest betrayal to DBZ fans since DBGT. Actually, it is even worse than that since there are still many things DBGT gets right that Battle of Gods does not. So, where to start?

How about the subtitle of the movie itself? At least Dragon Ball: Grand Tour has an appropriate subtitle since the greater part of the series involves a journey across space. If a comparison can be made, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is much like the critically panned Manos: the Hands of Fate, which was riffed on by the crew of MST3K, in that the viewer will constantly check the subtitle of the movie over and over again to see if there has been some mistake. One of the biggest flaws of the movie is the lack of battling, especially that of gods in the plural sense (""Prophecy of the Super Saiyan God"" would have been more fitting as a title).  This is because the movie is plagued with useless scenes that do nothing to advance the plot and easily could have been removed to no consequence to the rest of the movie, or in other words, the movie is plagued with filler. Even during the end when the story is coming to a close, there is an unnecessary scene about sushi and the fine dining of earth that goes on for three minutes, and adds nothing to the story even as an epilogue scene.

However, this movie might as well have been plagued with all the filler in the world for how crappy the actual ""Battle of Gods"" fight we do get ended up being. The fight has no tension, and you can tell that the so-called antagonist of this movie isn't really a threat to anyone. Outside of some temper tantrums here and there along side a few empty threats that are mostly played for laughs, he never posits himself as being a threat. For most of the movie, in fact, he is a very polite presence in the company of the Z-Fighters. They goof around doing things like dancing, singing, and even playing bingo. If this is not what a fan expects to take up most of the run time in a movie subtitled ""Battle of the Gods"", then I am afraid they will be greatly disappointed.

Which brings another big problem the movie suffers from. The antagonist sucks. His name is Beerus the Destroyer, and he is supposed to be the literal god of destruction in the DBZ universe. Emphasis on ""supposed to be"" because he acts nothing like the name suggests. He's actually very delightful in his mannerism, outside of a few instances here and there, and he doesn't show any signs that he really cares for destruction at all. Even when an old DB character, Pilaf begins threatening people with violence, he doesn't take delight in it. He's actually really annoyed that Pilaf would do that. Not to mention, his home planet is very much full of water, air, sunshine, and all sorts of life. You would think a literal god of destruction wouldn't live in such a tranquil looking ecosystem. If this is some clever attempt at being ironic, it doesn't come across well at all. King Kai mentions in the movie that Beerus isn't necessarily evil. He's more of a force meant  balance the force of creator gods. There are so many things wrong with this that I could write an entire review of just this idea in itself, but I'll stick to one point for brevity's sake. Why would a god of destruction ever be needed to balance the force of gods of creation? What good could that kind of balance produce that could be considered independent of evil? Even if life begins to over populate whatever sanctuary it manifests in, couldn't a god of creation, you know, create more sanctuary for it to dwell in? What does anyone need or want from Beerus in that regard? What does he even do anyway? It seems like he spends all his time sleeping. What destruction does this guy ever cause? The guy is all bark and no bite, never going for the kill even against characters that are no use to him alive.

This entire movie is inconsistent like that. DBZ movies usually are. Even in the movie's beginning, Beerus says he eradicated all dinosaurs on earth even though in the DBZ universe dinosaurs are quite blatantly alive, which we even see near the end of this movie. Is Beerus' an idiot or something? Even if this is merely a dub error, it's inexcusable since, not only the original series, but the movie itself contradicts this claim. There's no reason it should be in here if anyone was paying the slightest bit of attention to continuity. He also regards Frieza as the greatest destroyer in the universe even though that title had already been given to Kid Buu by the Supreme Kai before this. Why doesn't Beerus know about Buu for that matter? Does the guy sleep that much? Buu was considered the greatest threat to all life in the universe by The Supreme Kai. Now he acts as if he knew no such being ever existed. He doesn't even recognize Mr. Buu as Buu when he meets him. Speaking of which, why does Mr. Buu act like a selfish jerk to Beerus over some food when they meet? Did the writers forget that Mr. Buu is the good half of Majin Buu, that he expelled his dark half in Evil Buu when he befriended Mr. Satan? He wouldn't act like that now. In fact, why is everyone out of character. Goku and Vegeta completely grovel at the feet of this god of destruction, who is believed to be a possible threat to earth. They would never do that, especially Goku. Goku has always had an innocent sort of impertinence with the gods of his universe. That's who he is. He isn't someone who puts much stock in rank or authority. That sort of thing means nothing to him. He most certainly never regarded the gods as so above him that he'll grovel before them even if they are a threat to the planet. Even the Supreme Kai nearly got blasted away by him when he tried to stop his fight with Vegeta.

How does Vegeta get a power boost in his Super Saiyan form that makes him stronger than Goku in his Super Saiyan 3 form just because his wife was hurt? Vegeta has never shown the ability to jump to such powers when someone he loved was hurt before this, and no reason is given for why that would be different now. Not even when Trunks was killed by Cell or his whole family killed by Buu did Vegeta ever demonstrate this sort of jump in power. And if saiyans can make that sort of jump in power without ascending to the next level of transformation, what's the point of the transformation? This next part comes as a spoiler, so beware to anyone who hasn't seen this movie. Anyway, even during the final fight, Goku increases his base power because his body becomes used to his new godlike transformation, and thus, no longer needs the transformation to attain that power. Transformations have never worked liked this, ever. Way to marginalize them like that. Also, way to go in writing Vegeta so far out of character just to serve this ""pure saiyans creating a saiyan god"" plot line. Throughout the entire movie, Vegeta constantly grovels and humiliates himself before Beerus so that the guy would not destroy the earth even though, as mentioned before, Vegeta would never do that. That has never been Vegeta's character and he would never develop into that sort of character no matter how good he could reasonably become. Dende even tries to justify Vegeta's ""pureness"" by pointing out that Vegeta used to be a bad guy, but he's been fighting for the side of good for years. However, Dende's memory must be as bad as Beerus'. It's true Vegeta has fought alongside Goku and the other z-fighters ever since the defeat of Frieza, but the only side he has ever been on is his own. Did Dende forget that Vegeta kind of, sort of, submitted his will to the last great evil they all fought against just to obtain power, and even when he came to his senses, deciding to sacrifice himself to defeat that evil, Piccolo still told him he was going to hell despite that? Even during the fight with Kid Buu, where Vegeta acknowledged Goku's power, there was never any indication of Vegeta becoming this cowardly worm who grovels to people who threaten to destroy the earth. He's even still so prideful during this part of the story that he destroys the fusion earrings that would have allowed Goku and him to easily defeat Kid Buu just because he didn't like fusing with Goku.

And then we have Goku, a character who is presented as so innocent throughout the series that the movie has to invent character flaws he's never had just to pretend this movie had a story. The movie presents Goku as this prideful warrior who hates being weaker than anyone, ever, and resents needing help to achieve power even though literally every major fight he's had in the series contradicts that. Goku never resented using the Spirit Bomb against Vegeta, Frieza, or Kid Buu to defeat them. Goku never resented fusing with Vegeta. Goku never resented Gotenks or Gohan being stronger than him. In fact, he wanted Gohan to be stronger than him so that he could be the new defender of earth. Thus, the fact that this movie pretends that this is one of the character traits of Goku shows that they, including Akira Toriyama himself who helped work on this, care so little about these characters in favor of the subpar story they want to contrive that they don't mind giving a middle finger to their fans in the process of telling it. The worse part of this is later during the final fight, and this is a major spoiler. During the final fight when all hope seems lost against Beerus and the earth and everyone he loves is believed to be about to be destroyed by the guy, Goku gives up. Yeah, he just simply gives up against the guy. He just stands there shivering like a coward with his friends and family awaiting death. I honestly couldn't believe they wrote Goku doing that. He would never simply let someone destroy the earth and all his friends just because all seems lost. Even against Frieza he did every desperate thing he could despite how hopeless it got. For that matter, even against Cell when he said he gave up, he didn't actually mean that he gave up. He wanted his son to defeat Cell so that he could achieve a new level of power and be the new protector of earth. But we saw he was completely willing to take Cell on again if Gohan failed. However, here, he sincerely gives up. He gives up to the god of destruction no less. Not even the god of creation, the god of love, or the god of light but the god of destruction. He gives up not even because he's a god, which shouldn't matter to Goku anyway, but because Goku thought there was no way he could win. That's right up there with Peter Parker making a deal with Mephisto. That would be like if Superman gave up to Darkseid and just accepted the fact that Darkseid was going to kill everyone he loved right in front of him. I'm sorry but that is a big spit in the face of your fans. Fans of DBZ give DBGT tough criticism, but despite how horrible it was, at least, DBGT is consistent with characterization. At least there, Goku doesn't bend to the will of a deity like Omega Shenron or something and just give up. This movie is terrible. It's a spit in the face of all DBZ fans. Anyone who hasn't seen it, should avoid it like the plague of filler that it is.",1420070400,17,11143,4.43484626647145

5766759,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"I've heard a few people say this movie is a little dull due to it's lack of fight scenes, but I want to tell you that any Dragonball Z fan will not be disappointed by this film. I personally was most trepidatious about the introduction of a new character, Lord Beerus. On first glance he doesn't quite seem to be very visually appealing. However, I was happy to find that during the movie I fell more and more in love with this ""God of Destruction"". He finds a way to be charismatic, comedic, and still hold true to his own title.
Of course that purple cat thing isn't all the movie has going for it. Almost anyone you could ask for comes back in the move, mostly for a good laugh but then again this movie really isn't all about it's fight scenes. Not to mention all the art and even the few 3Dish CG scenes are all top quality.

5766807,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"This was a good movie and a wonderful trip down memory lane and days of ol'. DBZ has always been my favorite anime despite some of the hate that hardcore anime fans have displayed toward it. I say this because it may not be for everyone especially those only mildly familiar or fair weather fans of the saga. Like much of DBZ it is plot heavy, a 1/3 of the film is spent introducing the villain and a 1/3 is spent around Bulma's b-day party with our good friends/characters of the series that we've grown to love over the years. I watched the SUBBED version as that it what I grew up watching and I gotta say, there are some very funny moments, I laughed out loud more than a few times and I think it's the delivery in Japanese that really translates the humor.

That said, I REALLY enjoyed the upgrade to the animation style during the fight scenes. Swooping between buildings had an extra dimension of depth, 3Dish for lack of the proper term. This added to the fight scenes that we are all so familiar with from the series. But nothing new is truly introduced, punches send opponents soaring through rocks and ground, heavy ki blasts and ora fields that grow and fade. But don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with ANY of that.

(SPOILERS BELOW)

The reason I couldn't give it a 5/5 is the introduction of God Mode (not what they call it). Throughout the series characters trained REALLY hard and busted their butts to attain that next level of power. True fusion was involved at a point, but the characters trained hard before hand to maximize potential... but anyways... In this case they hold hands... I repeat, they hold hands... and BOOM.. GOD MODE. Which from a visual standpoint, was pretty damn weak if you ask me. I mean they even made fun of the transition during the movie saying things like, 'He looks the same, oh wait, his hair is red and he's a little skinnier'. The poster shows Goku SSJ1 which was confusing to me at first and although it makes sense now, I didn't know, the fact that GM wore off and he 'absorbed' the power (or whatever Beerus blatantly recants for the viewers) was fine but that makes the 'Battle of the Gods' technically a what, 2-3 mins portion of the movie. I'm nit picking like a typical fan boy but I mean, we've waited 17 years right? I feel like I just went out with a supermodel I've been fawning over for years and on the date we ate ramen in my '94 hatchback and shook hands good night. Ok, maybe that was over stating it but now that i'm done complaining about what little there is to about this movie, I am VERY happy that Akira was involved and that (as far as I could tell) the Japanese voices were the originals and that new Dragonball content is out in the world. They left the door open at the end for the next movie which is AWESOME and also aggravating because all the movies before had a pretty solid ending. And to see Goku lose was a bummer but hopefully the next movie will have a long montage of them training to achieve that next level.",1414713600,,3006,4.364285714285714

Then its just not for you which clearly goes without saying because I mean you have to understand the fact is the show has been running longer than I mean I don't know any anime series that's still being aired to this day in this is after I mean it its been on the air in a 10 year gap it's it's it's it's it's phenomenal like WoW like wow I can't believe it like oh my god they actually made it Akira Toriyama you will go down in history without a doubt in my book you know because I personally I love you but he's the man its a curatorial who receives all the credit for everything and anything that goes into this film but you know what he likes.

5766850,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!

I didn't have any length issues myself (it was the full movie), but as others stated the story lacked a bit. It was either that or I have just grown up immensely since I watched this show religiously 15 years ago and I am now just realizing how cheesy the writing actually was for DBZ. I was really hoping for an action packed movie where Goku and the Gang had to put everything on the line to stop their foe from destroying Earth and everyone they loved, but instead it was just some lame duck ""villain"" (if you want to call him that) who is just looking to test his strengths against the so called Super Saiyan God. Yes, Earth was in jeopardy of being destroyed, but not like in the past when they battled Frieza.

Those battles were knock out drag out fights to the bitter end. They gave everything they had (some even giving their lives) to protect Earth. This fight with the supposed strongest being in the Seventh Universe lacked a lot of the grit I remember as a kid growing up on this Series. Goku fights him, get his ass handed to him rather quickly, eats a Senzu Bean, watches his friends quickly get the crap kicked out of them back on Earth and then absorbs all of the other Saiyans powers to become a Saiyan God only to still lose to Beerus. This just seemed too rushed and a cop out way to become a God. I wanted to see Goku pushed so far to his limits that he snaps and becomes a God that way. Not a ""let's all form a circle, sing kumbaya and focus our energy upon him"" kind of way.",1413331200,,1538,4.227891156462585

5766895,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"Dragon Ball Z is one of those things I was into a long time ago, roughly around the time of the last feature film seventeen years ago. It's easy to see why so many love it. The animated series is just as goofy as it is battle-heavy and power-obsessed, starring a large cast of colorful spiky-haired characters with names that sound like they should belong to Monchichis. I didn't so much grow out of it as grow tired of the ""powerful bad guy shows up, Goku grows in strength to beat him"" formula. The new film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods stray from the script too much, but fans looking for the silly fun and epic planet-destroying fights they are accustomed to will walk away happy.

This is undoubtedly the weirdest Dragon Ball Z story I've ever seen and that's really saying something. The emphasis is clearly on comedy this time around, even the bad guy isn't necessarily someone you want to see defeated. The all-powerful Super Saiyan named Goku is at the center of everything, as usual, and he's in search of a fight to really test his amped up power levels. Fortunately he finds a willing opponent in Beerus, the feline cat god of destruction. Yeah, you read that right: the feline cat god of destruction. Beerus is the most powerful fighter in the universe, capable of blowing up planets with a mere gesture...but somehow he manages to still be kind of likeable. Maybe it's how he attends Bulma's birthday party and eats up all the food, marveling at every delicacy. Or maybe it's how everyone humiliates themselves to keep him happy enough to not blow up the Earth. Even the mighty and arrogant Vegeta is forced to embarrass himself (think showtunes) to stay on Beerus' good side.

And that's really the bulk of a pretty nebulous story that doesn't seem to be about anything but goofing off with these characters. There's a silly subplot involving poor Emperor Pilaf, he and his companions reduced to children, and their fruitless quest to attain the wish-granting dragon balls. Piccolo, Trunks (whose hormones are raging apparently), Shenlong, and nearly every minor (read: unimportant) Dragon Ball character makes an appearance mostly in humorous roles, and whether you find it funny will probably depend on your familiarity with the series. But when the cherubic Majin Boo refuses to share his pudding with Beerus, well then it's Earth that has to pay the price. Told you this stuff

Who would have thought that pudding would be the cause of the Earth's destruction? It's the cherubic Majin Boo who puts the world in jeopardy by refusing to share his pudding with Beerus. To save it, Goku must prove he's got the power of a Super Saiyan God in order to give Beerus his first real test. From Super Saiyan 1, 2, and 3 to turning into giant apes, there have been so many transformations Goku has undergone that it's hard to keep track. And really, none of them make a whole lot of sense. This is just the case of Goku needing to power up yet another level to win a battle, and at some point it loses meaning. What's interesting in this case is Beerus, who is legitimately beyond anything Goku has ever faced before, and without giving anything away it's safe to say no Saiyan has faced anything like him. Akira Toriyama created Beerus specifically for this film and he's probably the most unique character introduced into Dragon Ball in quite some time. Even the animation, a kinetic mix of 2D and CGI technology, is an exciting twist on what we're used to seeing and it gives all of the epic battles a little extra pop.

If you don't know a Chaozu from a Chi-Chi then this movie probably wasn't on your radar, anyway. Dragon Ball Z fans will find 'Battle of Gods' has leveled-up visuals and enough humor to pack the punch they're looking for.

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is having one final showing tonight, August 11th, at the Angelika Mosaic and Angelika Pop-Up.",1407628800,2,3879,4.656934306569343

5766914,5,B00D0Z2JT2,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really enjoyed dbz boz..
I had heard many rumors and reviews, an found it entertaining..
This moving sparked a new hope in the possibility for a new series.",1399852800,,192,4.361111111111111
5766915,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"Now I know the title sounds down, but in the scheme to the entire movie you get the usual, ""here comes a stronger enemy...oh crap they are going to destroy earth...how can we stop them.""

Aesthetically it's a very colorful and has a HD look. The characters are true to their old school form, since this is a Japanese sub, that means the characters are based off the Manga.

- I liked:

* The Old School Japanese Intro/Outro
* New HD Look
* Surprising Strength from Vegeta
* Intro to new Characters ( Lord Bill)
* Funny Japanese to English Translation...( Fat Buu is Hilarious)

Overall, If you are a dragon ball fan it is worth a look, but there are better movies and Enemies out there, like Bo Jack and Janemba! Also Android 13. Brutal Fights. This movie is light on action. Good Concept, meager execution. But, like I said it's cool enough if your a fan... plus I got it for a good price.",1399334400,,890,4.343373493975903
5766916,2,B00D0Z2JT2,I get it that Syians like to test themselves and are among the best fighters in the universe.  The orginal offering was for English language but I received it in Japanese with English subtitles.  I contacted Amazon who in turn contacted the vendor.  I was informed to keep the DVD and was refunded my purchase fee.  So the transaction went well in the end.  The story was action pact but a let down.  So while I turned out okay in the end I will think 50 times before ordering another Dragon Ball Z DVD!!!!!!,1397692800,,508,4.351063829787234
5766917,5,B00D0Z2JT2,Movie was great lots of action and laughs. It is a surprising new addition to the dbz franchise worth watching.,1397520000,,111,4.6

5766921,2,B00D0Z2JT2,"Okay, all those ""this is great"" five star reviews are for the movie AND, yes! The movie is fabulous!

BUT the DVD is a bootleg and not an official release. For those of you considering picking up this DVD, be aware that the English is not great. It's stilted and awkward and has no DBZ flair. The video itself is not perfect. While it's not bad, there are fan-subs videos with a higher quality image. The DVD cover has a bit of a ""I printed this at home look.""

If you want to support the anime industry in America, watch the fansub and wait for the official release. I will definitely be picking this title up again when it's NOT A BOOTLEG.",1396396800,4,641,4.245901639344262

5766923,1,B00D0Z2JT2,"This comes from Malaysia and has translations that are incorrect. Ghosting effects come on screen when there are faster paced scenes. Note that 99.5% of anime dvds coming from Malaysia are fake. Wait until you get a quality release with correctly translated subtitles. In other words, DO NOT BUY.",1395792000,,296,5.061224489795919
5766924,4,B00D0Z2JT2,"Like many Dragon Ball fans, I had been anticipating Battle of Gods for a long time. When it finally came to DVD and Blu Ray in Japan, I watched it without subtitles and was satisfied.

Be forewarned: this release is far from perfect. It's from Malaysia, and may very well be a bootleg. The quality is pretty good, but sometimes ghosting will occur during some faster-paced scenes.

The English subtitles, like the title suggests, are a bit off. It is often grammatically incorrect to a great degree, but still legible. If you absolutely need to get Battle of Gods on DVD for your collection, but you don't want to wait for FUNimation to dub it, then this is probably the best you're going to get short of the Japanese Blu Ray with no subtitles.",1395619200,2,744,4.544776119402985

5766926,2,B00D0Z2JT2,"The movie itself is good. Somehow I'm feeling misled by the info advertised, which gave me the idea that it is the english version and it's not. It's in Japanese with english subtitles. I don't speak Japanese and I rather read a book than having to multitask while watching a movie by trying to read the subtitles without missing a thing. They should've just specify that there isn't an english version of that specific movie yet.",1395532800,,430,4.671052631578948

5766938,3,B00D0Z2JT2,"I watched this in Japan via satellite TV .. recorded it too .. No subtitles .. all in Japanese .. I am just good enough to get by ....

The actual animation is top flight .. Great visually at all times .. I stopped watching after season 6 because I hate what happened to the characters for the most part .. Gohan becomes a metrosexual wimp .. Krillin looks so lousy with hair .. and Mr. Satan should never have had more than 2 scenes in the entire season 6 let alone survive for 3 more seasons ... as he is ultra annoying and not very funny ..

It was really great to see King Kai again .. I wanted to believe that this was right after season 6 at that point but .. no luck .. KK's voice in Japanese is even better than the dubbed one ..

Even so, I enjoyed seeing a lot of the funny interaction surrounding the party thing with Bills the God of Destruction and his assistant hanging out .. with old and new characters .. Funny enough all around ... but .. really .. would have liked more FIGHTING .. I mean this is DBZ .. what else would the normal DBZ fan want to see?!  Hate the young Trunks and Goten .. I mean .. how much cooler can you get that grown up Trunks? .. and now all we got is this child Trunks ... not that he is that bad .. but .. the adult Trunks has to be the most popular character after Goku so ..

Did like the 3 bad kids who stole a Dragon Ball .. new post-season 6 characters who worked for me .. Naturally bad and interesting in their own way ..

I really hate Goku's native Japanese voice too .. whinny .. irritating .. but since it is the ""original"" .. I have no right to complain .. I just like the American dubbed version so much .. Got too used to it I guess ..

Fighting action between Bills and Goku .. though too short .. was great ... And I do like Bills and his assistant ..original and interesting bad guys ... So I was happy and disappointed ... I was hoping Bills would destroy every new character after season 6 but ...  Maybe a rewatching with a English dubbed version will make me like the film more than just a little .. If you are a hardcore DBZ ...especially if you like post season 6 .. you will love this movie .. and think it deserves 5 stars",1393718400,,2190,3.995423340961098

8588281,1,B00D0Z2JT2,"This was an awful movie.  I'm not sure why people rated it as high as they did, it must be only because it was DBZ.  It had some hilarious moments, but it was overall boring.  The fight between Beerus and Goku was mediocre and there was no real payoff in the end.  It was like watching a movie that just suddenly decides to end with zero warning.  I had my reservations previously but wanted to watch it after playing through Xenoverse 2.  I regret renting it even if it was only $4.

I'm a huge DBZ fan and have always loved the shows and have watched most of the special movies.  I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one.  It could have been pretty epic, but they dropped the ball majorly.  If you're reading this, please take my review seriously because I really feel the higher ratings for this are not being honest.",1521763200,,830,4.296774193548387
