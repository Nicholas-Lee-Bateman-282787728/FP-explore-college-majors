1022962,4,630537841X,"WCW/nWo Halloween Havoc 1998 had arguably the greatest pay per view wrestling card of the year.  It started with a classic as World TV Champion-Chris Jericho defended his title against Raven.  Scott Steiner and  Rick Steiner finally face off in a match that includes the World Tag Team  Titles.  The Outsiders finally face eachother again as Scott Hall and Kevin  Nash do what they do best.  The rematch of the decade, in WCW that is, pits  Hollywood Hogan against the Warrior reliving their WWF Title for Title  match at Wrestlemania 6 (1990).  For the U.S. Title, Bret Hart defends the  strap against Sting in a very long awaited one on one encounter.  Finally,  the World Title Match.  Champion-Goldberg defends his title against Diamond  Dallas Page.  From top to bottom an amazing line-up.  All these hot matches  plus lots more.",932342400,,834,4.877697841726619
1022963,5,630537841X,"The main event featuring Hogan and the Warrior wasn't too good, but the undercard really made this ppv solid. 12 matches round out probably one of the most talent0filled cards in WCW history!",923270400,,191,4.818181818181818
1023054,1,630537841X,"Match 1: Chris Jericho beat Raven to retain the WCW Television Title.

-This was a back and forth match, with both men performing their finishing moves to no avail. Kanyon jumps up into the ring and Raven throws Jericho into him. He then attempts the Evenflow, but Jericho turns it into the LionTamer. Raven tapped out.

Hollywood Hogan Interview

-Hollywood came out accompanied by Eric Bischoff. He ranted about how bad he wanted to beat the Warrior, and re-told the story of how he beat up his own flesh and blood, Horace. He warned the Warrior about ""crossing that line"" and said he would beat the Warrior tonight.

Match 2: Wrath defeated Meng

-Throughout the whole match, the two wrestlers tried to prove their mentality. Meng became ""one of the first to knock Wrath down"". Meng never got a chance to put the Tongon Death Grip on Wrath, because Wrath performed the Meltdown on Meng to get the win.

Match 3: Disco Inferno defeated Juventud Gurrera

-Juvy came out in a flourescent outfit to fight Disco. Througout the match, Disco would get Juvy down, and then taunt him by dancing, losing advantage. Disco ended up winning with a Jumping PileDriver. Disco will go on to fight Kidman for the Cruiserweight belt later tonight.

Match 4: Scott Steiner Interview

-Big Poppa Pump came out and said that he had been around freaks all his life, so Las Vegas was a night off to him. He then commented on Buff, and called Buff and Rick ""losers"". He then challenged Buff and Rick to a tag team match against the Giant and himself. The match would be for the World Tag Team Titles. He then said he would also wrestle his brother after the match, if he loses the titles.

Match 4:

-This was originally supposed to be Finley vs. Jericho, but got scratched at the last moment. Finley was said to put Alex Wright's dad out of wrestling. Chants of ""Boring, Boring"" also went up during this match. Alex Wright turned against many of Finley's moves, and won with a Forward Neck Breaker. (I believe)

Match 5: Saturn defeated Lodi via Death Valley Driver

-Lodi claimed to be ""anywhere"" but Las Vegas. Saturn came out dressed like a ""80s fag"", and kind of walked like one, with a beret on his head. Lodi tried to slow things down, with no avail. Several times through the match, Lodi would leave to chase his signs. Saturn signed for the DVD and landed it on Lodi to get the win.

Match 6: Kidman defeated Disco Inferno to retain the Cruiserweight Title.

-Disco won a chance against Kidman by defeating Juventud Gurrera. By the way, Kidman came out to new music. Disco again would become unfocused by taunting Kidman. Disco set up for the Piledriver that beat Juventud, but Kidman jumped out of it. Kidman eventually took advantage and landed the Shooting Star Press on Disco to get the win.

Airing of Konnan's Music Video

-This was the debut of Konnan's music video, which was a rap video. If you didn't see it, you didn't miss much.

Match 7: Rick Steiner defeated Scott Steiner and the Giant to win the Tag Team Titles.

-Steiner and the Giant were defending the belts against Buff and Rick. So, if Scott loses, he has to fight Rick for fifteen minutes after this match. Buff was wrestling in blue jeans. When Buff was finally tagged in, he turned on Rick Steiner, and ran off, leaving Rick to fend for himself against Scott and the Giant. The Giant toyed with Rick by pulling him up while he was pinning him. The Giant had problems getting to the top rope, and when he did, he accidentally drop-kicked Scotty. Rick Steiner wins after Bulldogging the Giant. Scott argued the call to no avail, leading to his match with Rick Steiner.

Match 8: Rick Steiner defeated Scott Steiner

The match began right after the last one, with the Giant interfering several times. Scotty Steiner continually low-blowed Rick, right when Rick got an advantage. Someone in a Bill Clinton outfit, turning out to be Buff Bagwell, hit Rick with the SlapJack, while Rick jumped out of the pin. After a Frankensteiner, Rick kicked out again. Rick Steiner landed the BullDog on Scott Steiner, while Nick Patrick came in to make the pin on Scott.

Match 9: Scott Hall beat Kevin Nash via Countout

-What was originally scheduled to be a Bar Fight turned into a regular fight in the ring. Halfway through the match, Hall got on the mike and taunted Nash. Nash came back into the ring when the trainer told him he couldn't, and the fight continued. Nash let Hall beat him, and opened up and did not defend himself. Both men went for the Jackknifes, and both escaped them. Nash PowerBombed Hall once, then twice. He then crotch-chopped Hall, and left the ring.

Match 10: Bret Hart defeated Sting to retain the U.S. Belt

-Sting has grown a Gotee since we last saw him. Sting chased Bret in and out of the ring. Both men put on their versions of the Sharpshooter, and both got out. Bret reached in his pants for a foreign object, and Sting took it away from him. the referee took it away form Sting, allowing Hart to get the advantage. Sting accidentally knocked out the ref, and Hart intentionally leg dropped the ref. Sting then Superplexed Hart right on to the ref, making things worse. Sting went for a Stinger Splash, and hit the back poll, and then was beaten hy Hart with the baseball bat. Bret Hart then put the Sharpshooter on a knocked-out Sting to retain his belt.

Match 11: Hollywood Hogan defeated the Warrior

-The pace of the match was extremeley slow, and the ten minute entrances came as expected. This match was alot like the one from Wrestlemania VI. It was slow-paced and technical, not fast and high-flying. Eventually, Hogan dropped a knee on Nick Patrick. He then called the rest of the nWo out to come and jump the Warrior. The Giant missed Warrior with a kick, and the Warrior rid the Giant and Stevie Ray of the ring. Hogan continually hit Warrior with his work-out belt, and also used it to choke the Warrior. The Warrior then stole Hogan's belt and used it the same way. Hogan then pulled some illegal substance out of his pants and attempted to blind the Warrior with it, unsuccessfully. Hogan is now busted wide open. Horace then made his way out, distracting Hogan, with Biscoff not far behind. Horace went into the ring and hit the Warrior in the back of the head with a chair. Hogan then pinned the Warrior for the win. This was one of the worst Pay-Per-View matches of the year.

Match 12: Goldberg defeated DDP with the Jackhammer to retain the World Title

-Both men came out with Michael Buffer introductions, not surprisingly. Both men would take each other down, and then get right back up. DDP went for the Diamond Cutter, to which Goldberg threw him out of the ring. DDP signaled for the Diamond Cutter, and then was speared. Goldberg hurt his shoulder, and then DDP Diamond Cutted Goldberg. Goldberg kicked out and then speared DDP again, followed by the JackHammer to retain his belt.",1114300800,2,6895,4.596577017114915

- Kevin Nash V Scott Hall
- Sting V Bret Hart (US title)*2nd best match*
- Hogan V Warrior (Wrestlemania 6 rematch)
- Goldberg V DDP (World title match)*match of the year*",1036108800,3,437,4.214285714285714

1023057,2,630537841X,"Evertime I think I'm getting the Goldberg-DDP/Hogan-Warrior PPV I get this one instead, Its not too bad, with DDP/Savage stealing the show and Henning/Flair in a dream match.  The main event is pretty weak, Hogan and Piper in a cage Piper can work but hogan trying to climb a cage, you know what kind of risk taker he is so you can imagine how lame it is, the highlight of the match was when 9 Sting look-a-likes start circling the ring, then Savage blows by them and does an impressive jump off the top of the cage in what I thought would have broke his legs, then some fan climbs the cage and one of the Stings becomes an impromptu security guard and tackles him in the ring then Hogan and Savage start wailing on him, it was the most disorganized thing I ever saw, its made for a good ending to a match that was about to put me to sleep.

DDP vs Goldberg was a classic wish DDP would  have won.  I also though Raven vs Jericho was great.  Kidman both of his  matches were good!  Nash and Hall was a straight slugfest.

They weren't good matches but I would show them on the tape so the whole event was on there.  The matches that were missing were Wrath Vs. Meing,  Alex Wright Vs. Fit Finley, Saturn Vs. Lodi.  Not big matches but would of been nice to fill them all on the tape.  If your a NWO fan I would recommend this event.",1489017600,,416,3.9518072289156625
7888995,5,630537841X,"DDP and Goldberg was the story of this Show it was Goldberg's best match in his career. Hogan and Warrior match was great but Hulk here clearly paid off The Warrior so he could kick his ass most of the match and get his win back that haunted him for the previous 8 at Wrestlemania 6 Where The Ultimate Warrior was the first to pin him cleanly. People said the match bombed but I liked seeing Hogan and Warrior just back in the ring.

  Hall vs Nash was okay but disappointing without a clean pinfall as nash just beat the crap out of hall and walked out giving hall the countout win. Bret vs Sting was great. A big win for Bret in his WCW career and a real dream match. It wasn't Bret's greatest match but it wasn't his worst either. Raven and Jericho put on a great match that should be noted. 2 guys that should have been pushed to main event status but were held back.

  We had 4 solid main events and a great undercard WCW Delivered.",1469923200,,938,4.154696132596685

7888997,4,630537841X,"My personal favorite of the WCW era, but I can't in good conscience give it five stars.

This PPV sums up all that was good and bad about the WCW golden era of the late 90s. With the nWo storyline starting to go stale, WCW bring in the Ultimate Warrior of all people and a predictably horrendous match ensues. Hall and Nash fight over Hall's real problems, as the line-blurring nature of WCW begins to veer dangerously out-of-control.  Something in Schiavone's commentary also changed that night, as you can almost sense him protesting at what he sees ahead, saying, ""This is why I love this sport."" He would continue to cash the checks from there on, but had pretty much checked out of the product he was supposed to shill.

Then again, witness Goldberg have his best (and therefore just okay) match against DDP, who bumps his ass off for him as they tell a decent story. The undercard, as always, is very entertaining. And THAT set. Holy hell, WCW knew how to stage an event ... they just had no clue how to govern what appeared on stage.

This is WCW at the end of its great run; it's all downhill from here.",1424217600,,1111,4.431372549019608
7888998,4,630537841X,"The TV title match between Chris Jericho-Raven was a hard-hitting,fast-paced brawl. Both Disco Inferno's matches against Juventud Guerrera & Billy Kidman for the Cruiserweight title were high-flying showstealers. The World tag team title match between the team of Rick Steiner & Buff Bagwell & the team of Scott Steiner & The Giant was pretty a 2-on-1 hanicap match with Bagwell turning on Rick to boot. The Scott Hall-Kevin Nash match was a hard-hitting brawl and it could have gone better without Nash walking out on the bout. The U.S. title match between Sting & Bret Hart was a pretty solid back-and-forth match even with Hart cheating at the end. The Hollywood Hogan-Warrior match was a sloppy,messy piece of monkey trash. The DDP-Goldberg-World title match was pretty good for a WCW/PPV title match. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1280534400,,854,4.896551724137931

-TV Title:Chris Jericho vs. Raven

8/10 solid match

-Disco Inferno vs. Juvi

7/10 way better than expected of Disco

-Cruiserweight Title:Kidman vs. Disco Inferno

8/10 another great Disco performance, back and forth offense wrong man won

-Tag Titles:Scott Steiner and Big Show vs. Rick Steiner and Buff Bagwell

6/10 Buff is pointless,Rick tries to look good,awesome Big Show missile dropkick from the top. Too many damn low blows

-Scott Steiner vs. Rick Steiner

8/10 short and way better than the tag match but another pointless Buff. Both Rick and Scott do better than the first match experience.

-Kevin Nash vs. Scott Hall

8/10 an entertaining match to watch. slow at spots but has a steady pace with these 2 outsiders.

-US Title:Bret Hart vs. Sting

8/10 Starts slow but picks up in pace. Bret does a lot of the usual and Sting is more decisive in his ring moves (with the sinister goatee). Batdown ending

-the reurn match:Hollywood Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior

7/10 it is slow with some botched spots but not as bad as some people say. Defintly not a rematch classic to their 1st bout.

-World Title:Goldberg vs. DDP

10/10 A great fast paced match really back and forth for a Goldberg match (DDP carried GB). Nice moves and athleticism from both men. DDP is so underranked and laughed at as a wrestler but he is really good especially in this match. One of the final great WCW main events.

All in all a must have WCW tape. The card looked great and suceeded in delivering. MUST HAVE

7889001,2,630537841X,"I just got done watching this event and it was probably one of the worst pay-per-views WCW had back in 1998.  It was one of those shows that you watch and when your close to the end, but not there, you're like ""end all ready! end!""  I'll give you some of the matches:

Raven vs Jericho=good matchup.  No problems here

Disco Inferno vs Juventud Gurrerra= good match, but you can kind of tell Disco was having some problems with Juventud's moves

Disco Inferno vs Kidman for cruserweight title=good match

Ric Steiner/Buff Bagwell vs Scott Steiner/Giant=this match was ok.  I don't care for Buff Bagwell or Scott Steiner but I like the Giant and Ric Steiner.  They did the best moves in the match.

Ric Steiner vs Scott Steiner=ok, nothing spectacular

Kevin Nash vs Scott Hall=pretty good match, lot of power moves

Sting vs Bret Hart=was an ok match, but kind of disappointing since the 2 had wayyy better matches against each other

Hogan vs Ultimate Warrior=boring match, probably one of the worst matches on a WCW pay-per-view.  The show got boring during this one.

main event: Goldberg vs DDP=it was a lot better than the Hogan vs Warrior match, but Goldberg winning was pretty predictable as always.  As you can tell, I pretty much hate Goldberg.  He couldn't put on a 30 minute match if his life depended on it.

Overall, it was an ok show until about main event time.  Would I recommend this?  Yes because I'm a wrestling fan of WCW, but I would buy a different WCW show if you want some better matches",1129852800,,1511,4.588014981273409
