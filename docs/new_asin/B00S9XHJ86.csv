6965956,1,B00S9XHJ86,"What can I say about this terrible movie(SPOILERS ahead, but who cares cause this movie is crap). This movie is too unbelievable for a Michael Mann movie and the ending is just ridiculous.  Thor gets out of prison to help two governments track down this bad person hacker that he had dealings with prior to his arrest.  Thor gets to stay out of prison if the hacker is caught with his help.  Thor's best friend is one of the government agents on the case and asks if he can have Thor help figure out where the hacker is.  And, the best friend has a sister that tags along.  But, Thor is out and about with an ankle bracelet...wearing clothes like he stepped out of a GQ shoot.  Kicking butt with chairs and guns...yeah, so believable that the agents would let a jailed hacker do these things.  Then, Thor gets horny...whips out his hammer and sleeps with his best friend's sister.  The same friend who went to bat for him to get him out of jail...blah blah blah...Thor's bangs hang down when he is around the ladies...blah blah blah...Thor's bangs are hidden when he is kicking butt....blah blah blah....the sister's voice is annoying.....blah blah blah....Thor uses his hammer again on the sister after his best friend is against it...blah blah blah...  I can say that this is the 1st worst movie of 2015!  I really wanted to leave the movie early, but I didn't drive...lol.  But, hey...my opinion.  Give it a go if ya like :)",1422576000,2,1427,4.552941176470588
6965957,2,B00S9XHJ86,"One of Chinas nuclear reactors was hit by a hacker who disrupts the pumps to keep the core cool and causes damage to the surrounding area. But the hackers are also hitting financial markets as well and the CIA enlists the help of a imprisoned fugitive, Nick Hathaway, to find and stop the group from hitting their next target. The film is directed by Michael Mann whos work is credited for films like Miami Vice and Public Enemies. Its a cat and mouse game in this action drama that stars Chris Hemsworth, Viola Davis, Leehom Wang, and Wei Tang.

The trailer build up for the movie looked to be one that was intriguing and could be entertaining as it relates to cyber hacks; especially in light of everything going on now-a-days with Sony. Although the trailer came off as confusing as to how the narrative would go I still went into it with hopes that it would be a fun watch. But my hopes went up in flames as the movie is without a doubt a bore fest. I was surprised as to how bad the movie was because it almost seemed like two different films put into one with one focusing on the hackers while the other focused on two peoples relationship with one another. There was no melding of the two stories and only made the film last longer then it needed to be. Let alone the movie was almost two and a half hours.

As for the performances we can start with Chris Hemsworth as the second chance fugitive Nick Hathaway. Hemsworth was great and fit the role perfectly as he fought his way out of difficult circumstances. His character reunites with a long-time friend in Chen (Leehom Wang) whos sister, Chen (Wei Tang), develops a relationship with Hathaway to the dismay of his friend Chen. Yes both have the same names so Ill try to keep it simple. Viola Davis did fine as a CIA officer who followed around Hathaway and was responsible in tracking him as the manhunt was on for the hackers. The actress has taken on a lot of these similar roles lately and suites her well. With everyone else in the cast nobody was worth noting which says a lot about how the film went down.

Having mentioned it before, the film drags and so does the manhunt for the hackers because of how long the film is. One of my biggest pet peeves is for a movie to be longer then it needed to be. There were times I got impatient with the plot and gave up caring about what was going on because so much attention was built around Hemsworth and Tangs characters who oddly fall in love. Now Im not saying there was anything wrong with it happening but it totally felt forced to just add another facet to the story to keep the movie going. But it doesnt do the trick and you just sense something halting the progression of the film as if it were sitting right in the middle of everything.

And for the hackers themselves you come to find out that their previous attacks weren't just for things to go bad but to find collateral in the process. Whats troublesome with Blackhat is that you hardly see the villains in action or give the audience a chance to understand them. Rather your subject to the internet and visuals of computer malware infecting the databases at various locations around the world. The villain is just as important as the protagonist is and without them your looking for trouble. Theres a moment towards the middle of the film when characters are plucked off that signaled a hard blow to the movie. Without saying the names, certain people die that ends up leaving only a couple of characters left and narrows the focus even more to where your looking at your watch to see when the movie will be over.

I was so hoping to enjoy this movie but it ended up being pure boredom with an unbalanced script. How could anyone say they were entertained by this mess when hardly anything is happening for its entire run-time. Chris Hemsworth may have had a decent performance with a troubled script but hes had many more successes with other films hes been in. This film just doesnt cut it.",1422144000,7,3970,4.432876712328767
6965958,4,B00S9XHJ86,"As you'd expect, pressing enter has a lot more melodrama while Mann is at the helm. I've been a fan of director Michael Mann since his Miami Vice/Crime Story/Manhunter heyday, so I got just what I expected, including a Blonde anti-heroic protogonist. For example, The title Black Hat here is a nod to black hat wearing villains of old, but also current lingo for a malicious cyber criminal.  The film's plot was inspired by a 2010 case in which a worm ruined a fifth of Iran's nuclear facilities. While that worm's author may have reminded anonymous Mann's titular Black Hat is Nick Hathaway serving 13 yrs for cyber crimes, white collar Thor (aka ghost man) helps Feds 'drop the big hammer' on cyber terrorists for his freedom, the foreign players are on to him. Typical Mann characters (including a henchman who looks inexplicably like steeler Troy Polamalu) classic shots and music. There's a cyber tag sequence (or three), a ""change your password"" NSA hack (""we're in"" 1 hour 15 min mark)  a subterranean shoot out another in a storage locker labyrinth, improved munitions,  a fight with Hemsworth wielding tables and broken bottles, exploding siblings, hot zone & Hazzard suits  and boat, oh my yes boats (at night in front of Hong Kong skyline of course). The city looks amazing through Mann's lens, signature city pans are gorgeous.
 Overall worth checking out, even if you aren't a life-long Mann-Fan. Oh, FYI...Check your settings everyone !",1422144000,,1450,4.926229508196721
6965959,2,B00S9XHJ86,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Blackhat""

1. This was directed by Michael Mann, who is probably most famous for his 1995 crime classic ""Heat"". And ""Blackhat"" definitely has Mann's trademark cool look and feel. But something went very wrong somewhere. The movie seems like it was made by someone pretending to be Michael Mann.

2. It's about a mysterious computer hacker attacking various places around the world for unknown reasons. The Chinese and American governments get together to catch the bad guy. In order to do that, they must release a buff, hunky computer hacker named Nicholas Hathaway from jail.

3. This film is great proof that a movie can be complicated without actually being smart.

4. There is a lot of cyber-jargon used in this movie. Computer experts say it's pretty accurate. They're the only ones that will know, because the movie doesn't really try to explain anything.

5. Every 20 minutes or so, the movie slows down because the heroes have run out of leads. So Hathaway will look confused for a minute, get the ""light bulb"" look, and then tell everybody of an idea he just had that will lead the heroes down a new path. This path will last for about 20 more minutes. Repeat this step for about two hours, and the movie is over.

6. There's also a completely predictable and unnecessary romance that develops between Hathaway and a teammate. It's supposed to add some emotional tension to the group, but all it really does is bring the movie to a grinding stop, wasting any momentum that the movie had built up.

7. As the movie progresses, it gets more action-packed but less believable. The plot holes get bigger. And for an MIT computer hacker spending years in jail, Hathaway is surprisingly good in gunfights and knife battles.

8. This movie was not only the first box-office flop of 2015, it's one of the biggest box-office flops in history. A week after being released in US theaters, its scheduled release in Australia was canceled - which is where the star, Chris Hemsworth, is from.

9. This could have been a good movie. I don't know what happened. But in the end, it's just a way for computer geeks to fantasize that they're a sexy action hero with a girlfriend.",1422057600,156,2199,4.6909090909090905
6965960,4,B00S9XHJ86,"The film opens with a Chinese nuclear power plant losing its cooling pumps due to a cyber attack. The Soy futures market goes bonkers and everyone in Hathaway's cell block has an extra $900 in their account. Coincidence? The US and China team up to find the hacker. Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) is tasked with finding the culprit who used a RAT (remote access tool). Oh this wasn't just any RAT, but one that he and Hathaway created together while goofing around in college. So Chen makes a case that he needs Hathaway to solve the case and for someone to keep his sister (Wei Tang) company so we can extend the film to 2 hours and possibly attract a female audience with a bad guy love story.

Now the hacker isn't some fat guy behind a keyboard eating junk food, fishing out crumbs from his belly button as you would expect, but a bad guy with middle men who possess automatic cannons. Our guys travel with the NSA gal (Viola Davis- Hollywood obligatory African-American) to places like Hong Kong and Jakarta, of which we see the the back streets.

I liked how the film started out, but once we got into the middle part, it slowed down even with the gun play. In spite of going over 2 hours, I thought the chracter development was a bit on the weak side and seemed to have come from one conversation in the air. I could only half get into the film. 3 1/2 stars

6965961,4,B00S9XHJ86,"There were only four people in the large theater at a multiplex in Bellevue, Washington. This means that the critics and ticket-buying public have declared this movie to be a total bust.

Director Michael Mann (""Public Enemies""), working from a script by Morgan Davis Foehl (in his first time out as a writer) delivered a perfectly acceptable, though emotionally distant, hacker film. My companion and I, both fans of the star, were quite happy with it, thank you very much and enjoyed the constant super-close ups that was the visual style. We did NOT appreciate the jiggly hand-held camera work nor the unnecessarily long sequences of imaginary data swiftly moving through computers.

Let's talk about the cast:
  * Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") is Nick, a felon furloughed on the condition that he help discover the Blackhat (evil computer expert) who caused a nuclear power plant meltdown in China. He's on screen most of the time.
  * Leehom Wang (""Forever Young"") is Dawai, the Chinese law enforcement official charged with finding and prosecuting the criminal. He went to MIT with Nick and he recognizes the code used by the vandal as one they wrote while roommates in college. He gets Nick out of jail. This actor is just as handsome and appealing as Hemsworth!
  * Viola Davis (""How to Get Away With Murder"") is Carol, charged with the responsibility to protect the United States' diplomatic ties with China. She knows her way around interdepartmental rivalries at the Federal level and doesn't hesitate to apply pressure.
  * Wei Tang (""The Golden Era"") Lein is Daway's sister, a computer expert in her own right. He needs her expertise, and in very short order Nick needs her, too
  * Holt McCallany (""Blue Bloods"") Mark surprised me. His character has the responsibility to monitor the felon and make sure his ankle bracelet stays put; he didn't become the antagonistic FBI monitor we have come to expect, but instead was able to see the larger picture and react accordingly.
  * Richie Coster (""By the Gun"") Elias proved once again, that a drama has no depth unless you have an evil villain. He is an evil villain!

This has more than its share of running gun battles and typing on computer consoles (I can't even remember MY password; how do they get into these strange ones so fast?). The UNIX codes were all over the screen, my late son David would have enjoyed THAT!

This is R-rated for violence (no nudity or sweaty bodies) and due to unfortunate timing and so-so reviews, has just barely escaped a Direct-to-Video fate. I'm not optimistic...",1421971200,60,2556,4.854838709677419
6965962,5,B00S9XHJ86,"I would never thought that I will start writing reviews on this kind of genre, but seems like in the last years Ive got an interesting passion for the subject. I mean about what computers and high-tech can achieve today. I also studied a lot around the field, finding many fascinating things about our unseen reality. This is why I loved this movie.

I found it very interesting and I think the documentation behind it is more real than in other similar movies. Michael Mann did a great job with this one, but he has already a great history in movies (you cannot deny that). Maybe he intended to be a wakeup call for the general audience - in small drops  to become more aware about what is happening around us.

There are many mean reviews about the movie, but I recommend you to see it with a different eye, detached of anything others say and just take from it what your gut tells you. You won't regret it!",1421798400,4,909,4.366863905325443
6965963,5,B00S9XHJ86,"In the destructive aftermath of almost simultaneous cyber intrusions in China (at a nuclear power plant) and Chicago (at a financial exchange), the American and Chinese governments form an anxious alliance to pursue and neutralize the enigmatic perpetrator.  For further aid and expertise, they recruit Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth), a computer expert serving an extended prison sentence.  At once dubious and intrigued, he agrees to help in return for a potential pardon, and so begins a dangerous journey spiriting Hathaway and his compatriots from the United States to Asia.  And so begins Blackhat, the latest euphoric and hypnotic suspense film by master director Michael Mann, returning after a six-year hiatus from cinema.  Always pushing the stylistic envelope, he opens this film on an abstract and even psychedelic note, rendering the compromise of the power plant by malicious software as a 2001: A Space Odyssey-style dance of light and motion.  It is an astonishing and bold feat of both design and visual storytelling, and it establishes a chief theme of the film:  we now live in a world in which volatile crises begin in incorporeal digital spaces before exploding into the real world and disrupting actual lives and systems.

Dramatizing cyber security is a definite change of pace for Mann, director of such iconic and, in a sense, old-fashioned caper films as Thief and Heat.  What is sought after, stolen, and/or sabotaged here cannot help but me more aloof than jewels in a safe or bearer bonds in an armored car.  He achieves a neat balance, respecting the pace and vocabulary of this keyboard-centric culture of ones and zeroes while also incorporating his authorial voice and worldview, including characters defined by their trade, negotiating the gap separating escape and pleasure from their self-devised and often isolating codes of conduct (criminals and policemen as dueling samurai).  Also recognizable and exceptional is digital photographyin no way disguised to resemble filmalternating between graceful aerial views of glistening urban vistas and claustrophobic closeups with besmeared, on-the-fly urgency.

As for the casting of Hemsworth, known best for portraying Norse superhero Thor in the Avengers franchise, it is hard to deny his muscular and sexy presence is extremely far removed from the popular image of the computer programmer as a gaunt nerd.  However, he has clearly studied the melancholy masculinity of the finest performances in Mann films past (Robert De Niro's doomed thief in Heat, Colin Farrell's pensive undercover cop in Miami Vice), and he also conveys the character's capacity for cerebral gamesmanship while also, of course, more than holding his own as a prison-hardened physical threat.  A casting decision at first indicative of directorial acquiescence to a studio's desire for a chiseled leading man, authenticity be damned, proves convincing in the end and integral to the film's overall triumph.  Fine performances are also delivered by head-turning Chinese starlet Tang Wei (Lust, Caution), charming and sensitive despite her clearly modest grasp of the English language, and Viola Davis, a beacon of stony resolve as an FBI agent hesitantly cooperating with the Chinese.",1421625600,9,3245,5.4

I was puzzled at the beginning about the fact that it was a Chinese-American production.

The Australian (actor) protagonist was such a sleuth and a hunk, that he could trace the dab guys, fight impossible battles, shoot with one hand at a distance hitting the target and most importantly :  bring the bad guys down, while keeping the girl.
I am not being facetious:  all these twists and turns were actually GREAT to watch !
The film also raises questions of the danger of International Cyber Terrorism that knows no borders and how powerless individual countries are against it - even our Great Nation.

6965986,2,B00S9XHJ86,"Dull cyber thriller about a mysterious hacker who is wrecking havoc without leaving a trail or betraying any obvious motive--he causes a nuclear plant to melt down in China then manipulates a commodities exchange in the United States.  Chris Hemsworth is a genius hacker who is temporarily sprung from maximum security prison (for a white collar crime?) to aid a joint operation between the Chinese and Americans to track down and stop the hacker--and if Hemsworth succeeds his sentence will be commuted.

There are so many problems with this one it's hard to know where to even begin.  It's just flat out boring for one thing--Michael Mann doesn't really figure out a way to make hacking and cyber crime exciting so he tries to liven things up with occasional action scenes.  Which leads directly to obvious problem number two--Chris Hemsworth is playing a genius hacker who displays serious action hero skills when it's convenient, which is too ridiculous to buy without a fairly strong explanation, something the heavily disjointed screenplay makes virtually no attempt to provide.

Director Michael Mann has been responsible for a handful of excellent films (Thief; Heat; The Insider) and a couple of pretty good ones (Manhunter; Collateral) but he's been on a bad losing streak of late.  Blackhat represents easily his worst all around film since The Keep from back in 1983 and for my money probably qualifies as his worst film to date.  It also duplicates obvious flaws from two of his more recent duds, Miami Vice and Public Enemies.  Like Miami Vice before it Blackhat is way too sprawling and disconnected to actually function as an effective thriller or action film--both flicks have too many dead spots and too little story momentum and for painfully long stretches of screen time seem to be headed nowhere.

Another obvious problem is that director Michael Mann, who used to be considered a stylist, has become enamored with filming using a type of digital camera that doesn't provide a cinematically rich image.  This was extremely jarring in his period gangster film Public Enemies which took place in the early 1930's but frequently looked like an episode of Cops.  Projected on large movie theater screens, Blackhat looked muddy and soft and sometimes in the darker scenes it was genuinely hard to make out detail or clearly see what was going on.  That's pretty much the one area where Blackhat is improved on home video.  Viewing it on Blu-ray on a much smaller high def television screen the image is considerably brighter and crisper, although not so much that it could be mistaken for something that was actually shot on film.

Blackhat feels more like a chore to be endured than an entertaining commercial thriller.  It's simply too long, too slow and too flabby as storytelling to offer much more than a fleeting thrill during one of the infrequent action sequences.  Thr romance between Chris Hemsworth and actress Wei Tang feels too much like a replay of the one between Colin Farrell and Gong Li in Miami Vice and delivers even less emotional resonance this time around.  Hopefully, director Michael Mann will eventually get his mojo back and make another good film but there are no signs of that here.",1500940800,,3228,4.948148148148148

6966005,3,B00S9XHJ86,"On just about every level this is your typical, eminently forgettable New Hollywood meal: an international cartel of producers pitching their ware to a set of large, primary markets (the US and China), casting that is adequate at best (Hemsworth, that large slab of Aussie bacon, looks like he made the cut because they couldn't find Brad Pitt; Wei Tang is pretty but could easily have been replaced by any number of good Chinese actresses, not least Xun Zhou), a conventional story with a tolerable but still high degree of implausibility, with simplistic if not merely instrumental human relations (the romantic connection - not a Mann forte - between Nick and Lien is as expected the weakest link in the chain; a modicum of care with her character's bio early in the film would have markedly improved things, but then there's still Hemsworth...); pointless CGI (the whole overused ""Tron"" effect); requisite exotic locations, etc.

So, it's what Michael Mann brings to this that makes Blackhat worth watching for anyone who thinks of film as potentially more than just entertainment. He is not a metonymic builder like Paul Greengrass, piling second long cuts one on top of the other. With Mann, the time is always offered to contemplate the sheer beauty of the carefully engineered sequences, specially and often at night. Even the most cursory of couplings is a masterclass in the use of close, medium, and establishing shots. And of course, the action scenes are peerless. In a career that goes back to the early 80s, Mann has not exactly been prolific and that's unfortunate.

Five for Mann, two for the ho-hum script and the beefcake from Valhalla, that's three and a half. I'd watch it again with the sound muted.",1485648000,2,1721,4.9106529209622

6966038,3,B00S9XHJ86,"Director Michael Mann (Collateral, The Insider, Heat, The Last of the Mohicans) tries to make this story by Morgan Davis Foehl work by enlisting the always popular Chris Hemsworth as the main character of interest, but the story is so slippery and long-winded that the movie becomes somnolent. Some of the interest is maintained by flipping the tale from Chicago to Los Angeles to Hong Kong to Jakarta and the photography is splendid. If you're ready for lots of filling, dialogue in three languages (occasionally translated with subtitles), and some sensitive new faces in major roles, then give this a spin  there is plenty of time for kitchen etc breaks without losing a second of the thin plot.

Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth), a top of the line talented hacker who has gone astray, finds his way out of a 15 year prison sentence when parts of a computer code he once wrote during his youth appears in a malware that triggered a terrorist attack in a nuclear power plant in China. This opportunity will reunite him with an old friend (Viola Davis) but will also put him in the middle of a power game between the American and Chinese government as well as an arch villain hacker whose identity he has to find if he wants to keep his freedom and his life.

Viola Davis, Leehorn Wang, Wei Tang, Andy On, Holt McCallany, and that always the evil bad guy Ritchie Coster bring as much to their roles as they're given by the script. But at least for everyone concerned this is another chance to see the current heartthrob around the world  Chris Hemsworth  act well and be buff.

I have seen Chris Hemsworth in quite a few movies and he has always had a solid performance.  This one, not believable at all, so I have to blame directing, which is shocking because it's Michael Mann.  The ""love"" interest happens so quickly that it's not believable at all ( they look at each other and end up in bed, even drunk one night stands have a little more foreplay) and really not even necessary for this film.  Had they fallen ""in love"" after the brothers death, it would have played out better.  Having TV actors, low budget film actors in prime roles along side Hemsworth was confusing to say the least and just had me scratching my head.  They would have been better using actors we had never seen before.  The transition of this movie is so ""choppy"", no smooth transitions into next scenes, I was wondering if they ended up on the editors floor or the movie was just written that way.  It was all so predictable, sadly I knew the brothers car was going to blow up and I had never seen the movie before.  More of a made for TV Sunday Afternoon viewing than a major film.

Nothing against Hemsworth -- he can't switch off his handsome hunkiness with the stroke of a key -- but who on earth booked Thor to play a computer hacker, and what were they thinking? Ridiculous from start to finish, Blackhat is a lame, loose grab bag of cybercrime-movie cliches and action-movie preposterousness, and even with barely a sketch of a plot there are ginormous plot holes. It's as predictable as a Jackie Chan movie, but not nearly as much fun. None of it is believable, though much of it looks nice, thanks to Michael Mann's ability to raise a big enough budget to do some globe-trotting location shooting. It's the sort of instantly forgettable movie you doze off to on a long flight, or late night when it's on HBO. But don't pay money for it unless you like feeling like a dupe.",1468108800,,915,4.725

Boilerplate story, silly script, TV-quality cast, bad acting, zero character development, hackneyed visual style. I assume something dear of Mr. Mann's was being held for ransom when he was forced to make this asinine misuse of the public's time.  If you have fond memories of 'Heat,' 'Manhunter,' 'Thief,' 'Last of the Mohicans,' and, ok, even 'Miami Vice,' hold them close and explain to them that daddy's gone on a bender.

Granted, it's not a typical Hollywood film with things blowing up every 10 minutes or random car chases.  Instead, the film takes a more intellectual approach to its theme.  It's true that lead actors could have been better casted, but it doesn't take away from the film.  If you're into slow burners that develop progressively, then you'll enjoy the film.  I rather prefer European & Nordic films myself and I thought this film was closer to that style of film making.  It definitely doesn't deserve all the negative press.  There are far worse movies out there.  Put it this way, I thought it was better than all the Transformer movies.  It all depends what style of film you're into.

There must have been a special on this effect somewhere as it's used far too often.  The plot?  Well, it's another well worn one in a different coat.  Basically, ""It takes a thief to catch a thief.""  Chris Hemsworth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B005H9B2CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>) plays Nick Hathaway, a professional hacker who'd been caught and incarcerated.  Someone hacks into the Chinese National nuclear system overloading a particular brand of machinery.  Chinese Captain Chen Dewai (Leehom Wang) is tasked by his superiors to get to the bottom of it.  Chen tells his bosses he can do it but only with the aid of Hathaway.

Together with Chen's sister, Lien (Wei Tang), and FBI agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) who along with Mark Jessup (Hold McCallany), Hathaway's 'babysitter,' the group begins to backtrack bits and pieces of code remaining in the computer.  Obviously that sounds too easy.  There are several twists and turns and people trying to stop them from finding out the truth.  This is a fairly decent movie but it does suffer from overuse of that CGI.  And sadly, that overuse hits REAL QUICK and real fast.

He's a good actor in the right role, but playing a computer geek is not one he can pull off.  Secondly there are some really annoying CGI sequences early on that really take you out of the film, making it hard to get back into it because you keep thinking there's going to be another one.  Finally, this feels like it was shot by two different people.  Half the film looks great, like every other Michael Mann film.

Yet I have this happen almost always when I listen to music that inspires or provokes my creativity. This is the same effect I have when watching a Michael Mann film.

He's gotten a lot of flack for his use and style of digital filmmaking over the past decade but that has never been the deciding factor for me. What is most noticeable when watching this movie compared to his earlier work are the scripts or rather lack thereof. More specifically dialogue. It comes off cheesy in contrast to the serious tone. Its clunky and less fluid than his previous entries. His films use to orchestrate professional jargon and interpersonal longing into a nice, nuanced rhythm. That is no longer the case here and you might have some cringe-worthy moments when you focus in on certain lines delivered.

But I believe more so than most directors that Mann makes movies that are required to be seen more than once. This is probably too much to ask for when it comes to the average viewer but its been something that has payed dividends to me. Having known the story now and have since removed the marketing campaign that misaligned expectations I now view the film in a way that I allows me to enjoy for what it is: an ambient experience that cares less about words and more about the subtle emotions amidst abstract, technical chaos.

If that sounds like pretentious nonsense to excuse a sloppy movie you might be right. But it is my honest feelings. Its also the same approach I take to his other recent entries, Miami Vice and Public Enemies.",1448928000,,1666,4.583892617449664

The colors and the exotic locations are extremely interesting and contribute a lot to the story. The acting is fine, especially the enigmatic Tang Wei as the brooding girlfriend and the always mesmerizing Viola Davis.

6966128,2,B00S9XHJ86,"[Spoilers, I guess]

It's hard to believe this was directed by the same Michael Mann behind the masterpiece ""Heat"" and the vastly underrated ""Miami Vice"" (thick latin accent:  ""this is not casual"").

Mystery hacker (shown to viewers from behind as a slob with a mop of curly hair) causes Chinese nuclear reactor to melt down via cooling failure, prompting Chinese government to send Chinese computer expert (trained at M.I.T., of course) to persuade the FBI to collaborate on tracking down the bad guy.  He succeeds after a whole 15 seconds of persuasion/deliberation, then persuades FBI to get former college roommate (Chris Hemsworth) out of federal prison (again, after a whole 15 seconds) because he wrote the source code that enabled the cyber intrusion.  Hemsworth persuades the feds that the offered furlough is not enough -- no, if he succeeds, he wants his sentence commuted.  Uh, sure!

Chinese brother brought along Chinese sister because ""I need someone I can trust 100%.""  Overprotective Chinese brother shooed away decent-looking (and prison-free) bar fly buying sister drinks, but brother has no problem with sister shacking up with former roommate out of prison less than 24 hours.  Neither, apparently, do the federal officers sent along to keep an eye on Hemsworth.  Chinese sister is supposedly a software/systems expert herself, but her primary purpose in this film is to stare blankly beyond the horizon or pout when she doesn't get her way.

Hemsworth does his best, but he was a poor choice for this role.  At least once, I expected him to answer ""Who are you?"" with ""I am...THOR!"" (brandishing mythical hammer).  Instead he seeks out keyboards and monitors and pieces together a rather crude (in terms of complexity) plot to...MAKE MONEY!  That's right, the whole nuclear meltdown thing was just a test to see if water pumps could be made to...SHUT DOWN!

When the hacker trail leads back to China, Hemsworth goes along (sure!), visits the still-hot site of the meltdown and dons rad suit to retrieve hard drive (of course!), joins SWAT-like team to raid bad guys (complete with body armor), picks up and fires pistol when local liaison goes down.  It's the ultimate weekend adventure for a furloughed federal prisoner!

But it gets better:  when federal team, local liaisons, AND Chinese brother all get waxed, Hemsworth and pouty sister go rogue and take the fight to the hacker in Malaysia, where the ultimate evil plot is revealed:  he's gonna corner the world market on TIN!  Oh, the horror!

Visually, this is rather appealing, as all Mann works tend to be.  The several shoot-outs are done with typical Mann style.  But beyond that, the main reason I continued watching this film through to its absurd conclusion is to see just how awful it could really get.

There are plenty of hacker/spy stories out there that could make quality films (Le Carre's more recent books, for example).  But the writers of Blackhat should be blacklisted in Hollywood after this travesty.",1446854400,,2999,5.01010101010101

The film strives for modern relevancy with its takes on international cyber-terrorism.

It was strange that for the chemistry was so forced on his part. I think she did a good job, but when you have chinese actors speaking english some of the fluidity is lost.

I have fairly diverse taste but this movie reminds me of one of those hair shampoo commercials that zooms into the roots showing how the shampoo revitalizes hair because you can't show such a close up without CGI.  They try to spruce up this abomination by showing lighting quick computer transfers and such through similar CGI but it comes off forced and about 15 years dated.

I enjoyed the movie immensely though it had almost no sex, wan't predicated on action and adventure but rather on the thrill of unraveling a mystery. The data is all there to solve the mystery but it is not spoon fed to the viewer. Therefore,you can say the movie is about the cerebral thrill and not the adrenaline thrill. I am not quite sure about Mann's design motif but can say that Mann as a director is very original without being too original thereby staying in communication with his audience. It felt in the end like a hacker riff on some loose ends he left in his magnum opus ""Heat""  or even, on the major theme of Heat downsized for less hefty actors and subject matter. And I liked that.

Hemsworth's ""American"" accent comes and goes but is consistently distracting.

I am not a huge Hemsworth fan, and the rest of the cast was not stellar either. The plot was not one of the best by any means, but it is nevertheless worth seeing if you are a fan of the true artist Michael Mann is. I only hope is next project is a masterpiece, because Blackhat was not. I gave it four stars only because of Michael Mann, or it would have received two or three. Heat was a five, and Collateral was a high four stars, and Miami Vice was a solid four. Last of the Mohicans was a definite five star film, although it is not obvious Michael Mann filming. He had yet to master his unique style at that time, but the story was fantastic. Also, anything with Daniel Day Lewis is going to be excellent. He is the best male actor on the planet today IMO. Looking forward to Michael Mann's next film. Perhaps he will have Daniel Day Lewis play the leading role. Birdman still is my favorite film of the past year. I was shocked at how good it was, considering I never was a huge Michael Keaton fan. That role was definitely made for him. He did not have to even act because that is basically his career in a nutshell, and he was masterful in in. I think I will watch it again. It was excellent.",1439078400,,1363,4.166666666666667

I'm not much of a movie critic, but I'm extremely surprised that nobody, here or elsewhere, has picked up on something very obvious in this film:  It's remarkable similarities to the 1978 film, ""Who'll Stop The Rain"", directed by Karel Reisz, from the novel Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone, starring Nick Nolte, Tuesday Weld, and Michael Moriarty.  The male lead characters of both films are heavily involved in high-stakes crime, they're on the run with a woman they'd only recently met, and the odds are very much against them.  Chris Hemsworth channels Nolte throughout, Blackhat.  Not convinced?  How about this: The first name of Chris Hemsworth's character in Blackhat is named, aptly, Nick.

And, it did so in a way that explained it with some entertaining clarity e.g. the opening, and a couple of other scenes, showing packets of data traveling through computer architecture was about as good as it can be.
The rest of the film that dealt with cyber hacking was presented with accuracy and surprising clarity for a mass marketing film. Great location authenticity with filming in L.A. (OK, that's not so great), Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong.

On the other hand the action scenes were basically just movie entertainment and at times a bit overboard. Such as, and a bit farfetched, that our lead character (Hemsworth) is a world class coder (programmer) and some how had the time to become a world class action killing machine. Talk about being a Renaissance man!
More of an international cast would have been interesting. Davis (with Tina Turner wig which made no sense for an agent) was stereotyped into filling the black FBI agent role which seems to be a popular character placement in film in recent years (e.g., recently, ""Powers"").",1438300800,,1253,4.8279069767441865

6966238,1,B00S9XHJ86,"For everyone who likes their international thrillers ponderous, overbearing and filled with unearned machismo, but with lots of circuitry and an overly bombastic score, Blackhat is your new favorite movie!

Mans-man movie director Michael Mann (get it?) created macho fests such as Miami Vice, Heat, Public Enemies and his best, 1999s The Insider.  Here he unleashes his take on the cutting edge of hacker terrorism; those shifty, covert hacker cells holed up in hidden pockets of Eastern Europe and Asia.  One sociopathic brilliant hacker, a blackhat, causes a near meltdown at a Chinese nuclear facility, and of course, the FBI and Chinese security agency figure they need the services of a hacker to nab a hacker.

Chris Hemsworth has a permanently wounded look about him, as many male action stars do.  His work here is fine, though we are supposed to believe that top-level hackers look like, um, Chris Hemsworth.  Not only is he one of the most brilliant hackers in the worlda talent whose origin is completely unexplainedhe also knows how to prep for covert ops like a trained CIA agent.  We all want to be his friend.  Except, hes in prison for using his skills to commit Robin-Hood like computer crimes.  Hes quickly sprung by supervising FBI agent Viola Davis (in a role thats a waste of her considerable talent) and reunited with his old MIT roommate Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang), the leading Chinese operative on the case, and his sister Lien (Wei Tang), who is ALSO a brilliant hacker!  Tang and Wang, who previously costarred in the Chinese film Lust, Caution, have a good sibling chemistry here, though it is sorely tested by script turns that put her all too quickly and unconvincingly into bed with Hathaway.

At the halfway mark, we get some action that escalates the intrigue as they close in on who the hacker is, but the final act devolves into a revenge flick and loses all its smarts, all its intrigue, and all its credibility.  Gunfights and chases become the focus.  There is no follow up and we learn nothing further about the characters, their motivations, nor do we further explore the fascinating and frenetic world of trying to uncover who these cyber criminals are and what their next acts of terrorism might be.

Mann has cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh (who did such a gorgeous job on The Piano) wash the film in gritty yellow-gray tones and grainy textures and throws in puzzling CGI animation bits rushing through the innards of computer circuitry.

Somewhere in here was an interesting idea, but Blackhat needed a reboot.  Somewhere out there are brilliant hackers who also know something about filmmaking, yes?  I challenge them to hack this footage and create a better film.

CLICHES:  Entering a nuclear facility within days of a meltdown (not good advice for those who value their skin); gunfights, chases and characters trying very hard to explain the techspeak of their trade in laymans terms, which they wouldnt do with each other

SURPRISES:  For some reason, uses soundtrack music from the film Elysium.

6966251,3,B00S9XHJ86,"This is a film directed by Michael Mann, the Director of Heat, so I thought I knew what to expect. To some extent, I was correct. There was lots of action, a couple of lengthy shooting outs and, of course, masses of violence. However, as another reviewer put it very aptly, something went very wrong somewhere. As others have mentioned, the film will a terrible flop and, although it is entertaining, it is not too hard to see why.

First, there is the somewhat problematic plot in what is essentially a mix between a traditional action film and a techno-thriller. A hacker attacks a nuclear power plant in China for mysterious reasons, before creating a panic on the financial futures market for soya and making a tidy packet in the process. The targeting of the nuclear plant is perhaps supposed (at least thats what I guessed!) to make you think of Fukushima while the financial market manipulation hints rather broadly at various and multiple scandals, frauds and dodgy behaviours that have surfaced since 2008 in a number of these markets. The problem here is that while the sensational effects are good, you also need to suspend belief to buy into the story. Neither nuclear plants nor financial markets are, fortunately, as easy to hack into as suggested in the film. Both have various protections that are not even alluded to although this does not make them invulnerable.

To counter the menace, the Chinese and American government get together, form a joint team to go hunting down the baddies and release from a US prison one Nicholas Hathaway, a celebrity among hackers. Here again, there are some stereotypes at play. There is a sign of change in times with China having replaced what would have been Russia (or, more correctly, the Soviet Union) if this film had been shot thirty years ago in a somewhat extraordinary collaborative effort. You also het the archetypal bad boy hero: tall, blond, handsome, square jaw and all who, of course, despite being a computer geek, also seems to be an expert in all sorts of combat - unarmed or not  with all sorts of weapons. This only adds to the implausibility since the hero does not have a special forces style past and it is somewhat unlikely that such talents were learned at the MIT, or even in prison.

You can also expect the though bad boy with a soft heart to melt for the pretty Asian girl who, of course, happens to be the sister of his best friend, a cyber-expert in Chinese intelligence, no less. The problem with this feature which is supposed to add emotional tension is that it falls rather flat and does not add anything at all, not even the kind of sex scenes that a number of Directors feel obliged to include.

Also grating is the over-use of poorly explained cyber-jargon. This is something that simply does not help to follow the plot. Frankly, it rather put me off, regardless of whether it is accurate or not. At the risk of being boring, I would have appreciated a bit more explanations about cyber-attacks in general, and the special type of attacks shown in the film and that seem so difficult to counter in particular.

You can, of course, expect our heroes to save the world in the most implausible  and at times  disjointed - way, but at some heavy cost, especially since our hero finds it all and does it all almost single handed.

Finally, there is the acting. This is where I will be extremely brief because I simply do not want to become unnecessarily unpleasant. Stating that it is non-existent for just about all of the characters is probably a bit of an exaggeration, but it is not very far off the mark. None of the characters really felt real and just about all of them, with all arch-villains included, look like stereotypes.

So, why three stars all the same? Essentially because despite all of the flaws mentioned above, the film still retains something of the Michael Mann touch and some rhythm, at times. Despite looking and feeling like a product, and not a very well-made one, there is still some suspense, however superficial it may appear, and there is still quite a bit of entertainment to be found in watching it.",1437436800,3,4119,4.6689655172413795

6966267,5,B00S9XHJ86,"Like Michael Mann's Miami Vice from 2006 which everybody hated this movie also breaks with conventions and takes a very different approach. It sure has it's weaknesses with some lenghts and a story that is difficult to access. But as Michael Mann usually does he crafts his own universe around the protagonists and creates a unique experience by that. The film has a fascinating look and the soundtrack is also great (contrary to the discussion before the movies initial release!), the actors also deliver properly. I can understand that Blackhat probably is not on par with Heat or Collateral which were also directed by Michael Mann but I find the bad Imdb-ratings and all the internet hate this film receives to be completely unjustified. I also had my problems with the movie while watching it for the first time. From the second time on however I started to really embrace the movie and I had the same process with Michael Mann's Miami Vice movie from 2006 which I couldn't grasp in cinema and then absolutely fell in love with watching it numerous times at home. So, I recommend the same to anyone reading this, I have begun to really appreciate this movie and I guess like many other Mann films in the future this will be viewed as a classic.

Chris Hemsworth's character is a loner that always seems to be scanning his surroundings for threats. While this might be something his character picked up in prison, it harms the love interest connection with the movie. The romance between the male and female leads seems very forced. To keep Hemsworth on screen, he's dragged from scene to scene, regardless of the fact that his hacking skills aren't needed. (spoiler alert) After all his handlers are killed, Hemsworth ""the technical advisor"" go to great lengths to go from China to Jakarta to go after the bad guys. This is right after they escaped the same people in a gunfight. On the plus side, Hemsworth is fun to look at and they certainly take advantage of location shots.

You know, the whole ""lets check this out- beep boop beep-"" and the amazing hi tech display zips around as they ""code"" exactly what they want when they want (If only it were that easy- looking at you Chappie).

Anyway the movie and the coding displayed were much better than i expected. Thank you Michael Mann. My one major nit pick is Chris Hemsworth is just plain miscast here. It's just not believable watching Thor run around hacking stuff. In general the plot is okay with some good acting from support characters but, a general lack of believable motivation from many of them. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch once maybe twice then this is a good pick. If you are on the fence like I was expecting to hate it but still curious then do yourself a favor and give Michael Mann a chance here. 7 out 10 Hemsworth would code it again.",1435708800,,1094,4.285024154589372

have to be isolated and stopped.
The Chinese authorities send computer expert 'Chen Dawai' (Leehom Wang) to America to lead the investigation to try
and solve the Cyber-crime, he'll need a trusted team alongside him, he's brought 'Chen Lein' (Wei Tang) and insists upon
having 'Nick Hathaway' (Chris Hemsworth) in the team, however 'Nick' is serving a prison term.
'Nick' makes demands in exchange for his help, reluctantly the authorities have to agree as the threat is great.
The team along with agents 'Carol Barrett' (Viola Davis) and 'Mark Jessup' (Holt McCallany) set about the task which will
take them to several locations around the Globe to close in and identify the Hackers........trouble is, there have as yet been
no specific demands made.
As the team close in things turn violent, these people arn't going to be taken down without a fight......will the U.S authorities
keep their word with regards to 'Nicks' freedom.

It may have been more interesting with a Lizzy want-a-be. However they meant a computational entrepreneur who got a little enthusiastic. He is recruited to help the FBI and other US agencies that are getting a bit friendly with made in china.

It is not really anything about computers. However they have to do something to make it look like computers care action characters. They used to show computers as tape reels ""Desk Set"" (1957), then blinking light panels ""War Games"" (1983); now they show simulated microscopic looks at integrated circuits... shades of ""TRON"" (1982).

The movie is really about a bunch of good-guy buddies tracking down a ruthless cabal of bad buys before they can do evil things. They are hampered by governments and slow down enough for sex and hand to hand.

Will they get their quarry and ride off into the sunset?
Or will the NSA have their way and incarcerate the good-guys allowing evil to have its way and maybe even a sequel?",1434844800,,1264,4.654708520179372

Hemsworth is terribly miscast, but it isn't entirely his fault, since the script left much to be desired.  It seemed Mann wasn't sure how to visualize the film.  I don't know any hackers personally, but I imagine much of what they do occurs on a laptop screen and there was very little of that.  Mix that with other visuals, it may have helped.

Jeez, were they ever dashed.
The story wasn't nearly as compelling as I thought it would be and failed to suck me in. The result is that to get through the movie, I I had to  watch it in chunks over three nights.
The script was cliche city in parts - the romance between Hemsworth's character and the Chinese agent, for instance, was soooooo predictable.
But the biggest clunker about Blackhat was Hemsworth's leaden performance - he brought nothing to his character to make him interesting in the slightest. Standard action hero - speak little, carry a big stick - straight outta central casting. I didn't buy him as a genius hacker for one second.

6966353,4,B00S9XHJ86,"This movie is so much better than I thought it would be or that it had any right to be with the casting of Chris Hemsworth as a computer hacker.

First, I think Michael Mann does a fantastic job, in general, of creating an atmosphere in a movie and sucking you in with great use of visuals and music. This movie is no exception. Atmospheric and moody, the movie feels grittier than usual Hollywood fare and the scenes in Hong Kong, for example, really feel like you are there, not just on a set in another country.

Second, Hemsworth is far better than I was expecting him to be. I like Hemsworth as an action star (and as Thor), but this role called for him to be more thoughtful than his usual roles, and he is actually quite good. I couldn't help thinking how different (and likely better) the movie would have been with someone much less physically imposing (and geekier) than Hemsworth, but he does a good job.

Finally, the plot is decent. It is, of course, wholly unrealistic in much of its premise, and the climax is almost laughingly dumb, but the general plot keeps you guessing as to motive for a long time, and it holds interest quite compellingly. I was disappointed in how it resolved itself, but until that time, I was actually on board with the plot, the atmosphere and Hemsworth.

It would be easy to poke fun at the movie, but I got caught up in it and found myself enjoying it much more than I expected. It won't rock your world, but if you want an atmospheric and interesting thriller, Michael Mann does a great job of drawing you in.",1434412800,4,1554,4.40418118466899

Unfortunately, since this is the main drive of the story, the story falls flat. There is no hook and there is no hold. Now, a two weeks later, I can barely remember this movie apart from the feeling of disjointed narrative. I would still say it deserves more than 2 stars, but not exactly 2.5.

6966377,1,B00S9XHJ86,"Others have written about the plot, so I won't restate it except to ask what casting genius keeps ringing up the Hemsworth boys every time a hacker film is being pitched. Seriously, it didn't work with Liam (who's a better actor than his beefier brother) and a much better cast, why would anyone sink millions into an obviously inferior version of Liam's film? It seems as though Ari Gold is a light years better agent than the actual globs of human flesh which haunt the offices of Hollywood. Still want some plot? Okay, Chris plays a genius coder who was sentenced to 15 years in a maximum security prison (during which time, he does upside down push-ups and hacks into the prison's computer system to give all his inmate buddies huge accounts. I would imagine that both of these activities have greatly endeared him to the general population). Both the Chinese government and the American gov. are hacked at the same time, causing a nuclear meltdown in China which only slightly alleviates American concerns that the Chinese are behind the hack. The top cyber-cop in China is sent to the U.S. where he asks to be partnered with his coding partner from college who is . . . of course Chris. Initially, the CIA wants to only give Chris some time in the free world as a reward for his service (really? Would anyone with two functioning brain cells agree to that?), but Chris demands that his release be made permanent upon catching the international genius hacker who is using a version of the code that he and the Chinese cyber-cop had written back at university. And of course, the cyber-cop has a gorgeous sister who pretty much falls for Chris once he is in visual range. So far, pretty banal tech fare. Overly pretty people? Check. Exotic locals? Check. What should be tension-causing emails only provoking eyerolls? Check.

So why did I give this such a low score? For one thing, Hemsworth's acting is unbelievably wooden. I had thought that after his racing film he might sharpen the chops a bit and actually show some range. Nope, his emotions pretty much are secondary to showing off his admittedly impressive abs. Second, and this was the worst thing about this blackhole of time suck, was the insane overuse of product placement. I understand wanting to drum up funds. Godspeed, but do it with just a bit of subtlety. I felt like I was watching a 90+ min commercial for B grade products. What do I mean? Well, evidently international super-hackers use the same piece of garbage Toshiba computers that you bought your ten year old from Walmart last Christmas. Chris needs a smart phone, so he runs around the streets of Hong Kong shouting for a Droid. I'm not making that up. Yeah, the Apple company is probably the largest employer in China and most likely has a company down the street, but hey, doesn't everyone think ""Droid"" when they hear ""smart phone""? Lastly, the ultimate reason for why the hacker is causing havoc felt empty and left me completely unsatisfied. Not to mention the fact that, despite Chris being 6'4 and blond, he and his lovely Chinese girlfriend are able to blend into the local population in South East Asia with no issues and without the local police/airport security so much as batting an eye. Seriously, at least Bourne made his chick cut and dye her hair. No effort is made to conceal their identities beyond a pair of sunglasses. This is despite the fact that both the Chinese and the American governments have declared Chris (and I assume his lady) to be international criminals capable of causing nuclear explosions, financial market crashes, etc. Paul McCartney brought a little weed into Japan back in the day and was banned for decades, but cyber terrorists? Why send out any warnings or profile pictures of them? This film insults the viewer's intelligence, is convoluted, and worse, isn't even stupid fun like the early James Bond films or even the ""Fast and the Furious"" films.

The movie had a sexy look to it, loved the scenery across the world, and it was all real! The raw action/shootouts I didn't expect. This is what Mann does best remember. Plenty of dramatic surprises in the later portion that made me sit upright. Mann gave Hemsworth a few moments to really kick butt as the lead and the ending battle was pretty slick. Loved the way the movie began and progressed. Everyone has their opinion on what a slow movie is, but for me, the main characters seeking the terrorist kept it rolling, perhaps disguising what others are seeing as a slow flick. I personally find it interesting when real life hackers are able to crack into government files. If that doesn't peak your interest this may not be for you. I think critics get so used to watching Avengers CGI action they struggle to tune into a movie with some substance. I'm a fan of superhero movies but I'm getting tired of them frankly.

The ""romance"" was contrived, the bad guy was predictable and cartoonish.  This movie was written by a 5th grader during lunch hour.  So horribly written.

Admittedly, I am a Chris Hemsworth fan (Thor and Rush) and I grant that I am not a ""techie"" but I did understand what was happening and there was action and there were characters to root for and there were very good performances.

I kept hearing that it was a movie that hackers approved of, which had me thinking it would be a smart, clever, cutting-edge film.  It was none of those.

I really like the cast in Blackhat because they are smart, realistic and extremely good looking. Mann chose a lot of talent that is not as recognizable as some of the actors in his other films. When one of the Chinese agents gets shot in a gun fight the viewer is emotionally disturbed. The cinematography is spectacular. The style of Mann's films is conveyed in Blackhat with wide angle shots of airports, shipping yards and inspirational Chinese cities. Every shot in this film is carefully planned out and unique. When I saw Blackhat in the theater, the sound track was riveting. I watched it on my laptop and was equally impressed with the score. The story is compelling. The tech jargon in the film makes it realistic. Even if you don't know what a PLC is you will be entertained by how the technology is used to progress the story. While viewing Blackhat it felt like I was watching real news. The Chinese nuclear facility breach brought back bad memories of Fukushima.

6966500,5,B00S9XHJ86,"Guns, hypos, nuclear radiation, knives, computers, sticks and stones, bare knuckles; no matter the tools we use, a good story boils down to characters.  This movie is a great story of two people trying to save the world.  The director did a fine job, all the fat is cut away.  The acting is real, believable and the viewer is given a lot to care about.  I didn't really see any plot holes.  Story exposition is relentless as it marches us to the most plausible ending possible. And yet, I wouldn't say predictable.  There's no guarantee any of us are gonna get out of this alive.

To really enjoy this movie takes close attention.  It's not a film you can play a video game plus text plus chat with friends plus..... If you pay attention you won't miss the transitions, or the expositions embedded in the images.  The plot is very well developed, the bad guy's motivation is plausible and the danger is real.

Now I own the Blu-ray, and will watch it more over time.  It *does* help to be able to turn on English subtitles to follow the dialog;  some jargon is too difficult to follow via the audio, such as ""the Feeb"" that Chris Hemsworth says several times.  Once I *saw* it, I knew he meant the FBI.  A quibble:  I work in technology and found the use of keyboards a bit excessive - a lot of interfaces are graphical now, though not all.  A bigger beef:  the story structure makes it too easy to lose interest in the last 40 minutes or so of the film.  Also, the film was overlong by at least 20 minutes, probably more like 40 minutes.

The issues that bring less depth to the whole thing at least my opinion is that a lot of holes were left. Firearm action was pretty well done.  More of Hemsworth in prison would have been better for the plot and movie in general. The Mace him and he doesn't even flinch so you can tell he got hit with inert spray. You can also tell that when he goes into the Nuclear plant that everyone there is clearly a idiot. The lady speaking another language about dose rate and time was deplorable with a brush that bit of safety information aside with (she said Hurry). Then the fast decontamination after the retrieval of the hard drive (Right) oh and they just waltz right in and walk up the stairs after the lady said hurry. Plus a dude dies in front of them.
So as far as unexplained things the untraceable IP address is one that many HACKER type movies try to get the public to believe and the Black Widow special government vault of all data ever is another stretch. These require a lot of belief in a special government supercomputer. The tampering of the PLC's was obvious from the moment they had to explain what they were but not really.

6966537,3,B00S9XHJ86,"As a long time Michael Mann fan (I think ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is one of the best movies...ever), I'm always up for one of his movies.  Unfortunately this isn't one that will last long in the memory bank.  Compounded by audio problems early on (more on that later), I was never able to settle in with the story or the characters and the movie flounders until the final act.

The movie begins with an interesting, if not original, CGI effect that takes the ""camera-bug"" through the inner workings of a computer signal.  This time it is at a nuclear reactor in China.  At nearly the same time, a similar event is happening on Wall Street.  One catastrophe causes a nuclear meltdown, the other a meltdown of soy prices.  In China, a cyber-spy specialist, Maj. Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) is charged with finding out what happened.  During his investigation, he discovers that the bug was placed in a similar way as the Wall Street collapse.  He gets agreement to work with the American FBI to jointly find the criminal.  He has discovered that the way to hack the networks was developed by him while at MIT with the help of his roommate, Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth).

Hathaway is in the slammer for 13 years due to his cyber-criminal activities, but Chen needs him free to help.  An agreement is reached and now Nick, Chen and his cutesy sister, Lien (Wei Tang) along with their FBI babysitter, Agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) travel the world hunting down the bad guy(s).  Given the wooden performances by the cast, the film drags mercilessly through the middle portion of the film.  Perhaps Hemsworth was worried too much about perfecting his American accent or that Wei was having a hard time with English, it just isn't believable.  Even when Lien and Nick are left alone, they look at each other and just seem to say, ""Hey, we're alone, might as well make out.""

Mann and his crew almost rescue the film in the third act, thanks to some terrific action sequences and a stirring score by Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross and Harry Gregson-Williams.  Even so, some of the events are telegraphed with tradition Hollywood set ups.

The Blu ray transfer is a mixed bag.  The video comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While it looks just fine, there is nothing to really distinguish the transfer either.  Acceptably good.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is a near disaster, specifically with the dialog in the first half of the film.  The film just appears to be poorly mixed.  To some degree this may have been partially due to some over-dubbing post production.  This is especially noticeable with Lien's voice.  Lip synching errors are also noticeable when the Chinese speak in their native language.  There are dialog dropouts with sometimes nothing heard, other times just lower volume.  I thought there was something wrong with my disc player, but that wasn't the problem.  It was the disc/movie.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include the cast and crew discussing cyber threats, a location commentary and a third featurette called ""Creating Reality.""",1431820800,,3118,4.804511278195489

Plus it's produced by Michael Mann, and I've been a big Miami Vice fan since the original TV show aired. So I went into this thinking it had to be a shoe-in for one of the best movies I've seen this year.

Man was I wrong.

It droned on for what seemed like an eternity. The acting was horrendous. And it kind of reminded me of a low-budget cyber knockoff of Miami Vice. Awful. The only thing that kept me from turning the movie off (besides the fact I paid to watch it) was Chris Hemsworth. He may have phoned it in acting-wise, but at least he's nice to look at. Honestly, him being in it was the only thing keeping me from giving it 1 star.

The premise of this movie was really good, with the whole cyber attack is the new terrorism thing. Cyber warfare is the new kind of warfare. It could have been ripped from the headlines, with all of the recent news stories about the DoD and White House being hacked. So, I definitely don't feel like the movie was bad because of the story line. It was just really poorly executed.

Certainly you will find the dialogue to be somewhat static, at best . For sure: lack of emotion in characters. And now you wonder why I am giving this movie five stars? Well, I get Michael Mann. He never ever, ever, goes for realism. He is a master of surrealism; it appears to be a realistic setting; but it's really not. All of his characters are metaphors of real life, but they are not real life. So if you watch this expecting it to be a typical thriller, then you too will think it''s awful.

But, that is the talent of Michael Mann. He has made a remarkable film that not many will recognize now, but years from now... I won't say it is flawless, but the ambition, the enormity; if you really pay attention to the details, it is impressive. Yes, not for everyone; not for a lot of people.

6966591,4,B00S9XHJ86,"The critics were unfairly harsh on this film, I think, for a lot of the usual reasons, the main thing being that Blackhat is not your generic Hollywood thriller trying to imitate Bourne Identity or whatever but is actually more of an auteur work, similar to what Michael Mann did with Miami Vice.  As I said, this is a Mann film and his style and approach to film making is all over this thing.  The movie could have easily been much better, but for what it is, I was entertained by it.  In keeping with the kind of ponderous, meditative and weird approach Mann often has to his movies, Blackhat is not really some breathlessly paced crime thriller with tons of action sequences, but more of an oddly paced procedural with lots of that very atypical Michael Mann stop-and-go framing.  Similar to some of his previous films, the movie simply drops you into a situation with very little backstory or characterization (something that got a lot of negative reviews when he did the same thing in Miami Vice).  The movie just starts.....GO!...and you're off and running with this story about a bunch of people trying to catch a cyber-terrorist.  The storyline is fairly weak, and by far it's weakest element is the inexplicable romance between Hemsworth and Tang Wei which has no source in anything and involves two people with absolutely nothing in common, yet becomes the lynchpin of the entire film.  This is where I think Mann made a mistake.  In Miami Vice, the romance element was cleverly balanced with the obvious factor that the relationship was doomed from the start and had no future.  Here, though, it comes this central element for literally no reason other than ""we must have a romance in our movie because reasons.""  As someone who knows a little about computers and the old-school method of hacking and all that sort of thing, I thought the film admirably relied on being very accurate with its portrayal of the technology...which is great if you know what the hell all the people are typing on the screen and talking about.  If you don't...well...there's no explanation whatsoever.  Having said that, though, the film's uber cyber terrorist laughably somehow manages to avoid being traced while committing major crimes, but a simple ""whois"" command will reveal a proxy IP to a server he is using to view a remote camera?  Putting all that aside, the film does feature some nice, very distinct Michael Mann-ish moments, from the gorgeous photography and handheld camera work, to a few fantastic sequences that are clearly his signature work.  Ultimately, the problem is that, like some of Mann's previous films, this movie is more of a kind of meditative thing where the style IS the substance.  As a result, it has a lot of shortcomings.  I wouldn't say it's his worst movie, that honor goes to Public Enemies,. but it definitely is not on the level of Heat or Collateral or Miami Vice.  But, if like me, you're already a huge fan of that distinct style and craft that goes into Mann's movies, I can't see this film letting you down much.

Overall the computer stuff was mostly ludicrous and stupid in some cases. We have cyber criminal geniuses who didn't really seem too bright.

Michael Mann is a very interesting director. Unlike most directors he assumes the audience can catch up to what is happening and doesnt treat us like we are incapable of figuring out the plot without exposition after exposition. He uses technical language throughout this movie, but as you watch you can figure out what is happening. I really appreciate that. As for the movie itself it is tense and exciting.

It's nice to see his approach to filmmaking with a modern and topical story set on the world stage.

Some reviewers have complained that they've seen elements of this film before.  They probably have, either in Mann's films or some of his imitators.  But this is still an original work that blends its own unique mix that I enjoyed.  Mann's films have always had more style than substance, but the style is wholly his and makes an impression.

I enjoyed the technical authenticity surrounding many of the plot elements, although these are used more for flavor than as core parts of the story.  Mainly this is a decent international thriller that later takes a somewhat different turn as we discover who is behind the terrorist acts.

6966610,2,B00S9XHJ86,"Blackhat is director Michael Manns first film in about six years since Public Enemies (2009). The action thriller stars Chris Hemsworth, best known as Thor, Tang Wei (Lust, Caution), Viola Davis, Holt McCallany, and Wang Leehom. Despite the interesting cast and the films timely topic of cyber terrorism, Blackhat is a huge disappointment, feeling like an extended TV episode.

Chris Hemsworth plays Nicholas Hathaway, a genius computer hacker in jail. Hathaway is given a task of tracking down the hacker who has caused a nuclear power plant accident in Hong Kong, and together with Captain Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom), an agent sent from China and his best friend, Hathaway sets out to capture the perpetrator.

The biggest problem with Blackhat is that the script has little to offer in terms of originality. Blackhat means evil hackers, but the cyber terrorism sequences and the investigation after them lack details to interest us. Watching unconvincing visual effects showing the inside of computers is not a very thrilling experience.

Considerable portion of the film is in fact not about cybercrimes, but about more generic combat scenes you have seen somewhere before. There is a subplot about the romantic relationship between two characters, which no one really cares. With flat characters and the story that doesnt make sense (the motive of the hacker is just laughable), Blackhat is only mildly entertaining.",1431043200,3,1419,5.242290748898679

There are some very beautiful shots in Blackhat, and sometimes the music creates a certain mood very nicely.  There is also one very effective explosion of a car.  But the film as a whole is quite tedious, and, yes, the CGI inside the computer following the virus attack sequences look awful.  Mann had--maybe still has--a talent for taking a suspense thriller and drawing it out by focusing on the emotions of the main male characters, highlighting their relationships to women.  The problem with Blackhat is that the drawn out emotional parts have no emotion.  The main characters keep giving you their backstories (a cheap device) without giving those characters enough motivation to explain their actions or make the audience care for them.  The actor playing the American lead--the guy who plays Thor and is made to look Brad Pitt-ish in Blackhat --cant pull off the kind of performances Mann got from Tom Cruise, Pacino, De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Colin Firth (in Miami Vice).

The first half of the movie was interesting enough, as the team tracks down the trail of a mysterious hacker.  Leehom Wang was more entertaining to watch than Chris Hemsworth.  However, pacing suffers in the second half and many plot points, e.g. the romance between Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei, felt forced.  Minor characters are poorly introduced; was I supposed to care when the barely mentioned HK police inspector is gunned down?

Furthermore, Mann's reliance on long shutter speeds was terribly annoying.  I never liked the B-roll-esque footage it produces.  Its application in Black Hat made me think I was watching a home video.  Moreover, the combination of long shutter speeds using HD cameras and regular film cameras was distracting.  I realize it might be ""avant-garde"" but I wished that Mann had ditched this technique in Public Enemies.

It's a film that tries too hard to be stylish and forgets its foundation.  I think that part of the reason it's not as stylish as say Collateral, which employed many of the same filming techniques, is that its characters weren't nearly as exciting and fleshed out.

6966623,5,B00S9XHJ86,"My review will be bias just because i will always be a Michael Mann fan but let me see what i can say about ""Blackhat""

The film is about an imprisoned hacker joins his Chinese intelligence (M.I.T.) friend to catch a hacker who destroyed a nuclear reactor and manipulated the stock exchange for unknown reasons.

This is not his best film but it is not a bad film.  It has a basis in reality but just like any film, the loop holes to make the story progress and the disbelief in character abilities create an interesting dynamic.  The urgency to figure out ""why"" pushes the rising action forward which leads to some interesting fights and shootouts.  The beauty is any Michael Mann film is his pacing and it builds throughout the film to an short but intense climax.

I like this film because you can tell it is a Michael Mann film but it will be extremely slow for some people and it will be an issue of taste.  This film makes me think of his other films ""Thief"" as far as pacing wise and ""Miami Vice"" (which is the first 2 episodes of the tv series made into a movie).  If you can appreciate a movie for what it is supposed to be and enjoy the unbelievable things that happen just like any movie then you will enjoy this slow burn of a film.

Refn is a wonderful film maker and just like ""Valhalla Rising,"" ""Only God Forgives,"" ""Drive"" and ""Bronson"" not everyone will understand or get it.  Those that do love them.

PROs
 Nice shots of Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Malaysia (74 locations in 4 countries), culminating in an impressive shoot during a simulated Balinese Nyepi ritual procession in Jakarta 
 The sequences of information running through the guts of hardware and networks was kinda cool (apparently some reviewers didn't think so)

CONs
 So the protagonist is an elite hacker who also [1] is physically fit, [2] has the good looks of a movie star, [3] can defeat 3 thugs in unarmed combat (not one after the other, but all at once), and [4] can jump into a firefight if it strikes his fancy? I guess this is what happens when superhero movies become ubiquitous...
 Adding a love story (well, lust story, as the two knew each other for all of a few days) for broader audience appeal? Yawn.
 It has the look of a documentary; intentional or not, it wasn't a flattering characteristic
 Suffers from Hollywood Happy Ending Syndrome (HHES) with not an ounce of originality before the closing credits
 Although he probably wasn't, the screenwriter seems to be that kid who has played too much Counter-Strike and has an Asian girl fetish
 The computers make bip beep boop sounds to insult the intelligence of the audience. Seriously?? I mean, I know every movie ever made uses sounds that computers don't actually make, but you would think that a movie about hackers could restrain itself...

Why 3 stars if there are so many Cons?

more a movie about ideals and revenge.

6966628,2,B00S9XHJ86,"Michael Mann is a director known for creating exceptionally intense, atmospheric, and emotionally-driven films of every caliber imaginable...well, once in a while anyway.

While he is responsible for bringing the 1995 epic crime drama Heat to the screen, which he is mostly known for as well, there have been other films of equal potential that fell flat on their faces (Miami Vice, Manhunter, Public Enemies).

Plagued with a bout of awkward sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue accompanied by stagnant acting, Mann seemed like he was trying too hard to regain his footing. Speaking of which

Blackhat, Manns first film in 6 years, revolves around a notorious hacker of the same name, who terrorizes citizens by tampering with nuclear reactors and the stock exchange, follows the same beaten path.

The first red flag sprang almost immediately when Chris Hemsworth was cast as an imprisoned super-hacker who gets bailed out to track Blackhat and bring it down.

Not to reinforce any stereotypes or demean anyone with those kinds of interests, but how many computer geeks are out there who are ripped, excel at hand-to-hand combat with gun expertise, and you see where Im going with this.

But, hey, suspension of disbelief, right? Thats the reason people go to theaters, to escape reality. Watch 20 minutes of this, and youll jump right back.

The terms boring, tedious, and flat have never had a better reason to exist than in Blackhat. Its challenging enough to make a cyber-espionage film with a consistent level of interest and suspense, but its even more difficult to add a shot of adrenaline without making it look so ludicrously out of place with the overall tone of the movie.

Its like intravenously feeding a kid gallons of energy drinks and letting them loose. Its unnecessary, and a big mistake for all involved.

Also its annoying.

Aside from the uninspired action sequences, the acting and the story arc leave a lot to be desired as well. Did I already say boring and flat? Just checking.

Not wanting to sound like a broken record, but thats really all there is to say about the overall experience, not to mention the numerous muddled and confusing plot points and segways scattered throughout.

So its like playing Othello, in a way.

It seems that Michael Mann has found his own particular niche over the many years of his career. Considering the quality of his past few releases ,Its probably something that shouldve stayed lost.",1423180800,,2454,4.970660146699267
6966629,1,B00S9XHJ86,"Blackhat could have...no wait it should have been a good if not excellent film. The film dealt with a very timely subject of hackers, cybercrime and cyber terrorism that is a major threat to regular citizens private lives to the worlds vulnerable infrastructures as we with the hacking/virus that crippled Iran's nuclear program a few years ago most people suspect came from the United States and Israel, to hackers hacking into celebrities cell phones and releasing nude photos they had taken to the scandals over the hacking of Sony. There was a lot of great information and suspected information to create a well done film, and then you include a venerable director like Michael Mann who has done some really top notch thrillers in Heat, The Last of the Mohicans, Collateral, and The Insider, and then you throw in huge rising star in Chris Hemsworth, Blackhat should have been a good film, but disappointingly Blackhat is far from a good film.

The film starts off well with a nuclear power plant in China being hacked into causing one reactor to explode, and threating a meltdown, and a hack of the United States stock market. This leads Captain Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) of the Chinese military and his sister Chen Lien (Wei Tang) to the United States to work with the FBI and agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) to catch the cyber terrorist. Yes the beginning of Blackhat was interesting especially about hacking and code, and all that stuff I really don't know anything about, and could have been turned into a compelling film, but quickly dissolves into plodding nonsensical mess of a film thanks to Morgan Davis Foehl combined with some bad editing and Mann's questionable filming decisions.

Things quickly began to unravel with the story once the FBI got Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) out of prison. First the endless internet jargon was boring once it is used over and over again, and certainly would be hard technological inept to follow what is happening in the film. Next is the unbelievable and really needless romance between Nick and Chen. They meet for the first time when Nick gets out of prison, and the next day their having sex. The romance just didn't work, and the two actors had no chemistry to make it believable. The whole thinking of the villain just didn't make any sense. If he was in for the money I have no doubt there are much easier ways to get the money he wants, and then there are the bad guys themselves in Kassar (Ritchie Coster) and the un-named mastermind played by Yorick van Wageningen. Neither one of them had any presence or seemed threating at all not like Tom Cruise in Collateral, Robert DeNiro in Heat, or even John Ortiz in Miami Vice, which lead the film to be very predictable and anti-climactic.

Michael Mann's direction choices and decisions are certainly questionable in Blackhat. Mann's decision to use what I guess is called a digital camera/shaky camera to film Blackhat certainly was a bad choice. It absolutely didn't work in Public Enemies and it doesn't work here in Blackhat. I guess he uses them to add realism and grittiness to the film, but what it actually does is turn the film into a mess. The action sequences are badly filmed and put together, and then there are just some of his filming decisions like to have Chris Hemsworth starring off either into the camera or into the background endlessly and for what seems like minutes at a time. The first time it happens is when Hathway is at the airport with the FBI about to take off and he stairs off into the scenery for at least a minute. This first scene I can understand as Nick has just gotten out of prison for the first time in years, so yeah I can get that the filming decision and character choice, but Mann continues to do this endlessly throughout the film, a film that should have been edited down to less than two hours.

Speaking of the set pieces director Michael Mann used to be a master at them creating some truly masterfully thrilling action/drama sequences. The ambush of the British soldiers in The Last of the Mohicans is just one as it was exceptionally directed and filmed, as was the climax of the film. Who can forget the meeting between Robert DeNiro, and Al Pacion in Heat? It was the very first time the two acclaimed actors had filmed a scene together. It was a simple quiet scene between these two great actors that Mann wrote and directed, and who can forget the absolutely thrilling climatic shootout at the end of the film was the DeNiro and his fellow robbers were leaving the bank. Even the lackluster Miami Vice had its moments, but Blackhat had one half a scene that was truly thrilling and well filmed, but in general the set pieces of Blackhat were just bad. The gun battle/chase through Hong Kong was poorly done and filmed, and the climax in Jakarta was just predictable, boring and anti-climactic. The one good half set piece took place about two thirds of his way through the film. Kassar had put a tracer on one of the Hong Kong's detective's cars even though they could have just followed Hathway and the others to the restaurant and kill them. No Kassar and his men decide in a very predictable manner to follower the car for what seemed like days, and just randomly waiting for Hathaway and Chen to be out of the car before he blows it up. What came after it was somewhat thrilling as Carol and fellow FBI agent played by Holt McCallany come onto the scene leading to the only real riveting scene in the film.

Michael Mann was once one of my favorite directors of all time, but after the terrible Public Enemies, the disappoint bad Blackhat, and to a lesser extent the lackluster Miami Vice the shine has somewhat come off Mann's once great directing career, and perhaps it's time for Mann to fold up his directing chair and leave the stage going out as still a respected director before it's too late. As for Blackhat the film should have been a great film. It certainly had a timely subject dealing with cybercrime and terrorism, and maybe with a better writer, a director like David Fincher or Christopher Nolan along with a better cast Blackhat could have been a good film, but the film we've got is an absolute mess.",1423008000,22,6190,4.63901549680948

6966631,3,B00S9XHJ86,"I've seen two reviews of this movie: the security specialists liked it, the movie critics didn't. Both were right.

The computer-y stuff worked pretty well. Yes, changes to programs can destroy equipment, Remember Stuxnet? That was a case of malicious code damaging centrifuges - and I've unintentionally blown a few things by over-driving outputs one way or another. The financial shenanigans are pretty credible, too. And the whole idea of a bad guy trying malware before launching full scale operations is very well established. (My current job gives me some visibility into some kinds of attacks.) Too, the idea of new viruses building on old ones has practically become an industry, black-hats selling rootkits and whatnot to each other. And yes, people get punished for doing bad things, and some of those same people get hired to roust out other bad guys. Sort of a modern version of ""It takes a thief to catch a thief."" All those pieces are realistic and work well.

It's when Our Hero puts down his keyboard and goes into the real world like some kind of secret agent - well, prob'ly not. The guys who fight their wars on the wires tend to stay there - all that running around isn't their style. You'd have to look pretty hard to find a trained assassin among them (end even then, it would probably just be a delusion of grandeur). But, we're stuck with the cultural and dramaturgic expectation that finding bad guys means getting all manly with weapons you have no idea how to use. Despite starting with good pieces, our poor director fell into that error. It's a new era, and our scriptwriters need new idioms, but we're not there yet.

Hemsworth tried and failed to speak with an American accent - it was very funny, actually. He sounded like Thor pretending to be someone from New York or Texas - who could tell? I kept expecting him to summon his hammer. We skipped through the movie after that so we could figure out what happens at the end, which was not only predicable, but ridiculous as well. Spoiler alert: how can he walk away with $47M in his bank account without law enforcement knowing about it? Totally unrealistic.

This is definitely one for fans of Hemsworth (who acted his heart out) or the director, Michael Mann, who seemed to lose the plot in this one. The story starts off well, as does the photography, and then meanders down into a confusing mish mash of events - I think poor editing had a lot to do with this confusion. The imagery was often not clear and basically the motivations of the characters were fuzzy. The villain, when finally exposed, was portrayed as a chubby, latter-day hippie character with a Mwahaha attitude, but in some instances seemed unsure of what he was supposed to do. Not very credible as far as the story arc goes, but one for fans.",1523664000,,737,4.548872180451128
