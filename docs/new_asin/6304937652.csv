I did learn how to sign the song Bingo and Twinkle Little Star. Other then that, it's too difficult (for me at least). If you are really convinced you want to learn all the signs you'll have to do a lot of rewinding and play the songs again and again.

The signer in this video makes too many little mistakes. In ""Bingo"" she trips up too many times and catches herself. I don't understand why they didn't re-do it. I mean why publish a video with mistakes like that? Take a few minutes and re-do that song!

For ""Home on the Range"" there are a few times when she sticks her tongue out for a word that you really wouldn't stick your tongue out like that for. Try saying the word ""antelope"" and ""buffalo"" and stick your tongue out really far for the letter L's. It's just unnatural, looks unprofessional and is just too annoying for me to watch.

You might wonder why she would do that while singing ""Home On The Range"". But that leads me to the other reason I didn't care for this video. The signer doesn't sing the songs out loud but she mouths the words to the songs as someone off camera sings. Sometimes the singer is a woman, sometimes it's a man, sometimes a kid. So it looks really ridiculous when she's mouthing the words while a man or a kid sings.

If you want a good children's siging video then ""Signing Time"" and ""My Baby Can Talk"" are much better choices. Also, ""Signing Time"" has wonderful songs written by Rachel Coleman. She not only signs them but sings them herself, too. You will really enjoy learning to sign along with her great songs. If you still think you want to get ""Say, Sing & Sign Songs"" then I'd recommend that you at least try to get it from the library first. I've written other reviews for kids videos.",1116374400,,1887,4.292134831460674
