1977267,1,B00018Y0UC,"Let me first say that I adore Brit drama/period productions.  I enjoy the slow pace of these types of productions, where character development reigns over special effects or excessive violence and sensuality.

That being said, this production made absolutely NO sense and I finally had to turn the movie off after watching over 1 hour.  In vain did I try to ""get into"" it, but as there was no plot, no storyline nor any characters to develop that I could find (believe me, I tried), I gave up in frustration.

I give kudos to those of you who not only understood it, but actually liked it as well.  I concede defeat on both counts!",1150848000,7,631,4.5
1977268,1,B00018Y0UC,"I couldn't bear to watch the whole DVD--it was too different from one of my favorite books, Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" Like the recent ""adaptation"" of John Galsworthy's ""The Forsyte Saga,"" this seemed to have little in common with the literary masterpiece behind it except for the setting, the title, and the names of the characters. Very disappointing!",1086652800,12,364,5.186440677966102
1977269,4,B00018Y0UC,"This 1983 British made-for-TV adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel begins with the Ramsay family vacationing in their summerhouse in Cornwell shortly before WWI.  Rosemary Harris plays the mother, the ideal woman of the time, who forgives her husband's outbursts of temper and is loving to her six growing children, summer guests, and neighbors.  Michael Gough plays the husband, an educator who is frustrated by the confines of family life, and Kenneth Branagh plays a graduate student with strong political beliefs.
Constant throughout is the six-year old son's request for a trip to the lighthouse, but the weather is never quite right.  It's symbolic, of course, as it stands off in the distance, a future adventure that keeps being postponed.
The essence of the Woolf story is well captured although some of the characters were left out.  But we get to see a piece of the seemingly idyllic world through the eyes of the family and the resultant effects of the following ten years, which are filled with tragedy.  Cinematography is excellent, capturing the mood and beauty of the English countryside.  It's a melancholy story that keeps getting sadder as it moves through time.  And so, when the coveted trip to the lighthouse actually happens, it seems anticlimactic although this act is the glue that holds the story together.
I watched the first half of this video on one day and the rest of it on the next.  In this way, I was able to enjoy the acting and the atmosphere.  As I had read the book, there were no surprises and my interest was less in the storyline than how it was presented.  This kept me from being bored because the story is really very slow.  Virginia Woolf fans will like it. Others might wonder what all the fuss is about.  I enjoyed it.",1029542400,53,1765,4.769736842105263

8007961,2,B00018Y0UC,"As an adaptation of Woolf's novel, it's a disaster: it doesn't even have a good sense of basic traits the characters have in the novel. Mr. Ramsay's opening lines have him pontificating about metaphysics, while in the novel, he doesn't discuss his work at all--not once, and certainly not in this pompous manner.  Having Lily narrate (and turned into ""Aunt Lily"" ?!?) makes her seem dull and pseudo-intellectual. And so on.

However, if you can view it on its own terms and not as an adaption of Woolf, it's perfectly watchable.",1445558400,,528,4.791208791208791
8007962,4,B00018Y0UC,"This BBC presentation of the 1927 Virginia Woolf society primer is not quite as good as the experience of the novel, but wondrously close.  It's a very simple story of a largish English family going on summer holiday with a few guests at their fairly spacious house on the beach at Cornwall in the 1910's.  Off in the distant eastern sea, about a mile and a half, is a white-washed lighthouse.  And as the characters converse and mingle and consider this unasked-for gift of life, one gradually learns that the Ramsey's little boy, James, would love to sail out to it, but there's always some grown-up problem to interfere.  Middle-aged Mrs. Ramsey is played by Rosemary Harris, and is always there to comfort the boy, as well as guide the family through the usual problems of childhood and adolescence.  Her eyes don't exactly twinkle,  but there's no look of ""you could possibly displease me, child"" either.  And Kenneth Branaugh,, who later went on to great success with his ""Hamlet"", plays Charles Tansley, the working class, but also intellectual snob who provides a sounding board for the Ramsey families moderate wealth.  Finally, one of the young guests, Lily Briscoe, played by Suzanne Bertish, is an aspiring portrait painter, of some ability.
  This is the way it proceeds for the first 3/4's of the film.  Then, just as in the novel, things change.  People you thought couldn't possibly die, like Caroline Ramsey, do.  One son is killed in the war in France.  A daughter dies in childbirth.  The beach house appears to be in rack and ruin as the years take their toll.
  But after a few years, the remnants of the Ramsey clan return, perhaps in the mid 1920's.  And James father, to the  young man's astonishment, announces that they are actually going to sail to the lighthouse the next day (after, now, 12 years?).  But sure enough, the next day, they embark.  Meanwhile Lily hesitantly, once again, sets up her easel to express...what?  The still-standing house?  Her dead hostesses calm refusal to die spiritually?  And as James, at the sailboat tiller, slowly closes on the ""unattainable"" lighthouse, she finishes her ""vision"".  Who actually got the son there?  His almost constantly domineering father?  Perhaps in answer, Lily puts the last strokes on her portrait of the house.
  As I said, it's not the complete redemption of James or Lily's victory over the sea the fiction grants, but if you've never read Virginia Woolf, it's a good introduction.

8007963,4,B00018Y0UC,"This is a wonderful adaptation of the Wolff novel, in which a family and their friends are seen in a brief vacation to the summer house and then in retrospect.  The viewer gets to know how each of the people, with all their qualities and eccentricities, feels and perceives things.  There is nothing extraordinary about them, there is plenty of tension and faults, but also as solid a bond as there can be between such disparate people.  It is a question of taste and preference, but I found them absorbing and interesting.

The patriarch, an educator and philosopher, is a crotchety man whose career is on the decline, full and disappointment and regrets.  He is something of a bully with some of his children, has favorites and designated failures.  His wife is saintly, supporting him without question, giving to everyone, and aware of the balance of personalities and needs at every moment.  She is the anchor of the family, by far the smartest one of all, a force of nature, but ill.  Branaugh is a self-absorbed student and invitee, who doesn't fit in and burns with the need for attention.  There are also 2 artists, one a stodgy poet out of favor and a painter-spinster who strives to meet her own highest standards.  Each is a beautiful person in their own ways, but essentially mediocre.  Finally, there are all of the children, ranging from the favored eldest who moves into the place of the departed mother, the middle children, and a spoilt younger boy.  The personalities and places they occupy are distinct with a crystal clarity.

It is their last time all together before they leave home from marriage, deaths, and careers, initiating a deeper deterioration as the father resents his decline into professional irrelevance - he no longer has any good ideas.  Yet they go to the house once again, seeing everything in retrospect, not necessarily resolving anything, but somehow feeling having come full circle, even if sadness and loss reign.

I saw this when it came out and loved it.  Now, seeing it again 30 years later, I saw more layers to all the characters and was amazed at how much seemed new to me.  That is a mark of great art.

I recommend this warmly, but given the price, it might be best to watch it online.",1437264000,,2237,4.6923076923076925
8007964,5,B00018Y0UC,"An art film, for sure, with its soft focus photography, and the children are lovely. Folks in those days, whether down from London or on Old Florida's forgotten coast, used to hold house parties on the beach.",1407283200,,208,4.648648648648648
8007965,5,B00018Y0UC,"The movie was a attempt at following the book. Because of Virginia Woolf's style of writing, any approach would be difficult",1400630400,,124,4.9523809523809526
8007966,1,B00018Y0UC,Suzanne Bertish was a fine Lily Briscoe but why would Hugh Stoddart have wanted to replace Woolf's exquisite language with his own.,1396137600,,131,5.0
8007967,5,B00018Y0UC,"Most of the passages are well-sequenced and carefully delivered.  An oral version could never match Woolf's sense of sequenced poetry, so we have yet another ""interpretation"" of ""we perished each alone.""",1387324800,,203,5.548387096774194
8007968,5,B00018Y0UC,"Filmed in Cornwall with fine photography. Virginia Woolf set the book in the Hebrides; at the time, she had never been to Scotland. She got all the flora and fauna and landscape wrong. Her actually holiday home was for many years in Cornwall, which she gets right.
Mr Bankes, alas, is omitteed from the film. Surviving parts perfectly as you would imagine them, esp. Mr Ramsay and Lily. Clever leap over the ten years without destroying the story line. Snap shots fill in the missing ten years and events occurring then. Film emphasizes and clarifies some of the books motifs. Juxtaposing of scenes brings out the significance brilliantly.
A superb film of the sort, alas, no longer made by the BBC or even available in the UK.
