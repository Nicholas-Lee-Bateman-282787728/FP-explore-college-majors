8278275,5,B001AO2OMC,I am into the violent aspect of it but having such great actors made it worth while as a dark comedy.,1505433600,,101,3.857142857142857
8278276,4,B001AO2OMC,"Although this is a bit of a fun spoof and not to be taken all seriously, Akshay again demonstrates his talent.  The character he plays is very different from any others AK has played.  Wonderful to watch him.  Arrived on time and in good condition.",1501372800,,248,4.466666666666667

8278279,5,B001AO2OMC,"You know that often movie previews show the best scenes and the rest are sleep-inducing...well, this is one case that the movie is funny from start to finish with drama and music as well.  I find that many of Akshay Kumar's movies are this way, though not quite all...",1382400000,,268,4.469387755102041
8278280,4,B001AO2OMC,"I love Bollywood, and Bollywood comedies. You have to develop a kind of taste for them. This is a good one, funny, easy to look at, great energy, and lots of passion from the actors. It has plot, structure, action, reaction, and the characters follow their arcs---make personal changes in their lives as a result of the story's spine.

It is well-made, great scenery, and beautiful actors. These are people who can really act, when called upon, and each is given a chance to show their real goods as the story unfolds, from a tearful but baaaad woman, to an endearing criminal  ""Rocky,"" a manaical mafia don whose so rotten you love him, and a dumb professor who is forced to turn so slick he's no longer likeable---it's all very well thought out in three acts

Is the ending predictable? Of course.

Is it realistic?

Of course NOT!

Is the action anything different?

Yes---it is the most different action you will ever see. Great action, great looking actors, very satisfyng payoff :)

 I am unable to take my eyes off Kareena Kapoor who is just stunning beautiful and put together. She dances up a storm with tremendous energy and fun, and she can really dance. In Bollywood films you can have a courtroom scene and sudden ly everyone will be singing and dancing. It's like that; I love it. While the dances and singing in this film are not really really challenging by Bollywood standards, they are tight, energetic, and excellently performed. OK, the movie seems a little silly to the western eye---but this is a VERY entertaining little film. See it! :)",1377907200,,1560,4.684981684981685
8278281,5,B001AO2OMC,"Fun Spoof style action film ,steals from them all... Sweet innocent girl ( Kareena Kapoor )gets savvy call center guy cum english teacher (Saif Ali Khan) to coach her boss (Anil Kapoor) in all things english for an upcoming business meeting. Handsome teacher, innocent victim servant girl sweet romance budding smack,smack,smack wake up already this ain't Disney...drop everything but the money and your gun and run..Too late.

Saif starts this film by diretly addressing the camera and for me that is not a problem because it's perfect for setting up his characters motivation and pulling you in with the hilarious flash pics and statements from his childhood. Segue into I'm falling in love dance/song and you're up to your armpits in danger and bikinis  already..all is not as it seems. Poor poor Kareena...will it ain't Kill Bill but she aint Bambi either.

 Just before intermission send in Akshay's thug character in hilarious headgear for local play , delivering his sides dialogue and how he's on his way to becoming a wannabee shooter for life. He's a recovery agent , a rough tough , smokin hot blood hound who knows what he wants and he won't stop until it's in front of him and he's saying the magic words where's the money Pooja???  He's got a bit of a soft spot in his head for women and damsels in distress...wonder if Pooja will take advantage....very funny scenes ahead.  The wildly funny send ups... Holy Widows ( hey prodigy of speiberg speak Hindi)..the side bar jokes and the pure adrenalin done for the hell of it because you CAN shoot it out with the commandos (AKI does his stunt stuff and it's fast and rocks). Last but not least take out ALL your brain cells and floss with them. It's time for the festival of shoot em up burn em up karate em up, stick em up hose em off exhausting ,exhilirating wild crazy ending. That bicycle of death is a hoot. Watched this multiple times. Lot of fun.",1336953600,3,1914,4.664688427299703
8278282,4,B001AO2OMC,"I just saw Tashan. Why do you guys who says this movie is bad? This movie is cool.
The movie would not have been half as entertaining without Akshay. You will love his character. A wannabe shooter with a heart of gold. He is the soul of the movie.

A perfect weekend movie. Just sit back and enjoy.",1302480000,2,298,4.137931034482759
8278283,5,B001AO2OMC,"Okay,

This movie does not provide a message, or is deep.  It is entertaining.  Quentin Tarantino actually was consulted on this movie (per the credits).  It's just a fun, funny shallow mindless movie.  Like Pulp Fiction.  Don't show it to your kids.  Don't watch it with the family.  Just watch it for what it is.  It's different.  And good.",1241395200,2,342,4.6440677966101696
8278284,1,B001AO2OMC,"(1.) This movie starts out poorly by self promoting for 10 minutes other movies with no skip/ff option. (2.) About a third of the movie is low budget staring at the screen shots & dialogue - boring. (3.) Another third of the movie is a C grade disjointed rip off of B grade Mexican spaghetti action scenes - lots of fire pots; very fake shoot outs; pursuit & crash; thieves stealing from thieves. (4.) Can''t Indian movies present, for the most part, females in roles other than smiley, head & hair turn, vulnerable sex toys?  (5.) Thank you, fast forwarding.",1221177600,,559,4.59
