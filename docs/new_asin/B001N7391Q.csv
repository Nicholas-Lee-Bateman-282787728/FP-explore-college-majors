8323281,4,B001N7391Q,Awesome footage of big gnarly wave riding.  If you have surfed or are a surfer you will most likely enjoy this movie. I would recommend.,1432080000,,136,4.44
8323282,4,B001N7391Q,"Good video with great shots from in-water cameras as well as heli photographers.  Nice to see different angles of the same ride - from the guys in the water, to the guys on boats and jet skis and from the chopper guys.  It gives an full perspective of the power of the waves, how they're shaped and how they break in Teahupoo.  Fabulous to watch and a must for anyone who's thinking about heading down to Tahiti to ride Teahupoo.  The power of that break is utterly amazing.  I particularly liked Hamilton's comment about having second thoughts about taking off on the wave that ended up becaming the biggest wave he's ever surfed - fear and self preservation over-ruled by personal determination.  Neat stuff!!!!",1315612800,,713,4.709677419354839
8323283,5,B001N7391Q,"I was walking down a street in Pacific Beach, CA, and walked by a picture framing store and saw a picture that caught my attention. I was so impressed by it, I purchased the picture. I have never spent $150 on a picture in my life (I was 50 at the time), but I had to have this one. The photo was a huge wave taken from Tahiti, at Teahupoo. The wave was like a bowl, breaking around what looked like a circular reef.

Since then, I've been looking for dvds about Teahupoo. This dvd is very good and if you want another good one, if you can find it, look for the ""Blackwater"" dvd.

The ""Inside Teahupoo"" dvd shows typical big wave footage, as well as footage from a brand new 360 degree camera, showing ""in the curl"" shots from the surfer's point of view, looking in front, from behind, looking up, basically all around with the new camera, which was debuted in this film. The dvd also shows the surfers and producers, working out the ""bugs"" in using the new camera.

Teahupoo (most of the surfer's pronounced it ""chahpooh"") is an incredible break that can only be appreciated fully, by film, other than being there. I found a picture somewhere, from Teahupoo, that had so much upward velocity, that the face of the wave was vertically flat! If I can find it again, I'll give the source later.

This dvd also has as a special feature that films surfing a ""super typhoon"" in Japan. This is a good addition to the dvd, about a couple of locals and the big wave ""gang"" from around the world, waiting to surf the big waves of a super typhoon.",1291161600,,1537,4.326388888888889
8323284,4,B001N7391Q,"Some really great surfing once you get over the ""testing new filming methods"".

Pros:  Great surfing, great waves, great scenery and such
Cons:  Way too long of the filming-process and detail of gadgetry... Technically,
  the film is: ""Inside Teahupoo"", so... that's what you get... a bunch of
  dudes trying to get this perfect action-shot using under-developed tech.

Still give it four-stars because it's beautifully shot and has some great scenes.
I'm a tech-guy, so I understand the process of developing some new tech that has
too many problems to start with, but I'd have thought it would've been worked out
before the film got to rolling.  Surfers know how to make the best of anything on
good waves, and it's worth it to check out their style.

It's a great flick, but... if you're looking for Laird-style stuff... this ain't it.",1280102400,,838,4.879432624113475
