8708771,2,B000CEVCEC,"Fairly disappointed. I was expecting much more from it. Basically, it's about a guy driving around showing debris (sometimes driving up and down the *same* street!). Very irritating ""soundtrack."" Could have been summed up in 2-5 mins. I didn't rate it a 1 because it did provide one of the things I wanted - images of the devastation. Otherwise, it would have been a ""0"" or a ""1"" tops. Good intentions, but pretty bad execution. Sorry... I do not recommend this product.",1211673600,,470,4.7439024390243905
