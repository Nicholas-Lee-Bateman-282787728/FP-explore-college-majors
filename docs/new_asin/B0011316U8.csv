3058734,4,B0011316U8,"The One is a well written script,and I think the acting by Li is superb.  He manages to do some sort of twist to his face while being the villian, that isn't on the good guy.  The action sequences are great and real looking.  Anyone who likes a well plotted story with great martial art sequences should like this movie.  I have not seen Red Dragon yet, but am anticipating a good movie.",1353888000,2,387,4.260273972602739
3058735,5,B0011316U8,"Excellent package!  Triple Jet Li!  First, ""The One"" martial-arts superstar Jet Li, in an imaginative, supercharged, futuristic thriller is just what you need...takes a new look at an old SCI-FI premise -- that hundreds of parallel universes coexist simultaneously in different dimensions. One is home to a villainous Li, who discovers that every time he kills his double on an alternate Earth, he absorbs the equivalent's life force and grows stronger. Nearly unstoppable, villainous Li gets unexpected and spirited resistance from one of his last remaining counterparts, an idealistic sheriff's deputy. The sheriff's deputy is accused of crimes committed by his evil duplicate and must find a solution. Exciting and Explosive action!!",1272153600,5,736,5.5625
