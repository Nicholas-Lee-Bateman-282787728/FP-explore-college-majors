591687,5,6303196543,"This, being the first Akira Kurosawa movie I have ever seen, was not at all what I expected from a samurai movie director.  The cinematogrophy was surreal, especially in letterbox.  And the acting did not seem like acting  at all, it was all so subtle and real.  Any definite plot structure or  objective would certainly have taken away this movies beautiful simplicity.",931737600,4,370,4.903225806451613

The characters are so well constructed and  the acting is so good, that they really get into you.  The character Derzu  is one that will never  leave me, one of the most curious characters I have  ever seen.",924048000,3,384,4.4

591777,5,6303196543,"An Eastern, as opposed to a Western. The latter is a vast genre of movies that, to a very large degree, has provided enduring myths as to the settlement (and seizure) of the American West by people largely of European descent. A few classics, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Noon/dp/B000LPH18I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Noon</a>&nbsp;are on to-be-watched-again-list.  A few decades after the exploration and the settlement of the American West, the Russians were attempting much the same, in a harsher climate, in their Far East. This is one of the very few movies that I know of concerning that Russian exploration and settlement effort. And the director is a Japanese, of the nationality which came into conflict with some aspects of the Russian nationalist thrust, including a quick and major war in 1905 (which is unmentioned in the film). Not any Japanese, but perhaps their most famous film director, Akira Kurosawa, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon-English-Subtitled/dp/B004D3ICOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon (English Subtitled)</a>) fame, and numerous others.  Thanks to a couple of Frenchmen, Sylvain Tesson and Cedric Gras, I have been reading a bit about this once obscure and forbidden part of the world, and thought it was time to re-watch this movie that I first saw, in the 70s, in my favorite (and only!) art theater in Atlanta at the time.

The movie was produced in 1975, in full cooperation with the Soviet Union, where it was filmed. Where, precisely, in the vastness of the Russian Far East was the movie filmed? The one identifying piece of information is the naming of the town of Korfovskaia at the beginning of the movie, which Google has informed me is not that far south of Khabarovsk, a major town on the Trans-Siberian railroad, with a population today of half a million.

The movie commences in 1910, with one of the protagonists, a Russian army captain, looking around Korfovskaia, for the grave of his friend, Dersu Uzala. Time has moved on, and no one has heard of him, nor do they even have a graveyard, as they inform him, since it is such a new settlement. All around are the cedars and firs of the vast Siberian taiga. Flashback to 1902, when the same Russian army captain is leading a small survey crew of Russian soldiers who are mapping this vast region. And that is when he first meets Dersu Uzala, a native of the region, who wanders into their campsite one evening. Dersu is a nomadic hunter. After an invitation, he agrees to serve as their guide.

The sweet spot of the movie is much of it: the cinematic eye of Kurosawa as he captures the topographical beauty of Asias Far East. Many scenes, of course, shot from unusual perspectives, in the taiga, some great ones in the fog. There are others on the open flat plains near a lake. The most stunning is one of the very red (did he use a filter to enhance?) setting sun reflecting on ice, with the black silhouettes of two figures walking, hence Dersus statement that man is too small in such a landscape, which, is certainly one of its attractions, when compared to the termite heaps that Tesson said he fled to live along Lake Baikal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dans-Les-Forets-De-Siberie-French-Edition/dp/207045150X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dans Les Forets De Siberie (French Edition)</a>. There are also moments of intense drama, as when Dersu saves the captains life. And there is the pathos of displacement and the aging process. Can a man who has successfully called the forest home retire to the constraints of a city?

Politically correct considerations? The movie was made with the full cooperation of the Soviet Union. Yes, it was mentioned that Dersus entire family had died of smallpox, but nary a mention, natch, of Russian effort to exterminate the natives much like so many American westerns, particularly in the days of yore. There is also a charming photograph of Dersu with the balalaika.  And who should be the VERY bad guys? Those despicable Chinese bandits, who torture and rape our women, as they attempt to move into the same area the Russians are moving into. Reflective of the days when Soviet and Chinese army units would sometimes slug it out on the Amur River.

Despite the concessions to the time and place, it remains a great movie. 5-stars.",1503446400,4,4440,5.243661971830986

591779,4,6303196543,"Shot in remote Russia with the cooperation of the Soviets, this film is a rumination on modern man's self-distancing from nature and the price he pays in his loss of sensitivity to the natural world. The print is clear but scratchy. Most unfortunately, the film has been badly dubbed into English, as was the method of the times, and the soundtrack is also poor. How much better it would have been if left in the original Russian with English subtitles. For this reason I am giving it four rather than five stars.

Set a few years prior to the Revolution, the film explores the relationship of a team of army surveyors out of their depth in the Siberian wilderness, with the lone Goldi hunter who rescues them, and becomes their guide. The friendship that develops over time between Dersu Usala, the hunter, and the team's leader forms the emotional underpinning of the film, and as Kurosawa's depiction of a man who is comfortable in nature, we are captivated by Dersu's sensitivity to his surroundings, his respect for fellow creatures, and his survival skills, which more than once save the company.

By the film's end we are haunted by the character of Dersu Uzala and nostalgic for a place we've never been. Or maybe it's a state of mind we have forever lost: a sense of being a part of the world that exists beyond our cities and cell phones, a world we will never know but always miss.",1494201600,4,1392,4.608870967741935

592117,5,6303196543,"This is a MAGNIFICENT film, a real monument of world cinema and I loved every minute of it! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The real story

In the beginning, there was a book, ""Dersu Uzala"", written by Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev (1872-1930). Arsenyev was an officer in Russian army under Tsar regime and in this quality he led numerous military expeditions across Eastern Siberia, mostly drawing maps and marking land for roads. His soldiers also occasionally clashed with ""honghuzi"" bandits (mostly Chinese), who roamed Eastern Siberian wilderness robbing native hunters and enslaving the women, who were later sold to brothels in China.

During his journeys across Ussuri basin between 1902 and 1907 Arseniev befriended a Nanai hunter named Dersu Uzala. The Nanai are an indigenous East Siberian nation, also known as Goldi, Hezhen or Samagir, who in times of Arsenyev were hunters, trappers and fishermen, but also frequently served as greatly appreciated scouts for the army. In our time around 13 000 live in Russian Siberia and 4500 in Chinese Manchuria.

Dersu Uzala was not a young man any more (he was probably almost 60 when he met Arsenyev) but he was still a great hunter, an excellent marksman and a greatly respected tracker. At one occasion he saved Arsenyev's life and with time they became close friends. In the book he published in 1923, already in Soviet times, Arsenyev described adventures and conversations they had during their travels through Siberian wilderness as well as period during which Dersu Uzala lived as his guest in his house in Khabarovsk.

Real Dersu Uzala died in 1908 and Arsenyev died in 1930. During the Great Terror, in 1937 his wife Margarita was arrested by NKVD  one year later she was murdered after a 10 minutes ""trial"" for ""espionage"". Their young daughter Natalya was initially spared, but ultimately arrested in 1941 for no apparent reason and send as slave to one of Gulag concentration camps.

2. Kurosawa's film

In 1971 and 1972 Akira Kurosawa lived a very difficult moment, as he couldn't find financing for new films - profoundly depressed, he even attempted suicide. Towards the end of 1972 he was approached by Soviets to come and turn an adaptation of ""Dersu Uzala"", offering him a rather comfortable budget and quite a large autonomy in the writing of scenario and general artistic vision of the film (well, at least by Soviet standards).

Kurosawa quickly accepted and got to work. Because he wanted to make this film ""feel"" real he insisted to turn it really in Siberia, in harsh conditions  for that reason the production took some time and the film was ready only in 1975. The film was turned in Russian and all actors were from Soviet Union, even if initially Soviet authorities wanted a renowned Japanese actor to play the main role (Toshiro Mifune was approached).

Kurosawa however wanted to have a genuine Siberian to play Dersu Uzala and finally his vision prevailed and an experienced Soviet actor Maxim Munzuk was selected, who belonged to Tuva nation. The Tuva look not very different from the Nanai, but as they live in less hostile environment, they were traditionally cattle herding nomads rather than hunters. Kurosawa's choice was as always excellent and Maxim Munzuk offered a STELLAR performance.

3. My impressions about the film

This is a great masterpiece, long but never boring. In principle there is not so much action in this film, the rhythm is slow and the main character speaks a broken pidgin (very well translated into English by the way)  and yet there is great magic in it, conjured by a great master. This film simply will not let you go  once you began, you will HAVE TO watch it until the very end

Dersu Uzala is an amazing character. When we meet him, he is already aged and we quickly learn that life was not kind for him, NOT A BIT! And yet, there is such a great internal peace in this man, so much cheerful joy of living and such a harmonious relation between him and the rest of universe, that there is no place for even one drop of bitterness in his heart and no place for even one drop of evil in his soul. His opinions on nature and people are quite a deep thing to listen to  and they force into some reflexion. Last but not least, Dersu Uzala is a man who follows HIS OWN PATH, as he sees it fit - no matter what the consequences...

Arsenyev (played by Yuri Solomin, still with us in Year of Grace 2014), is also an endearing character. A well-meaning, calm and gentle man, he is fascinated by Dersu Uzala and is delighted when the latter accepts for a time his hospitality in Khabarovsk, so he can transmit some of his wisdom to his young son (who also instantly falls in love with the old hunter).

This film is basically about a triangle formed by Dersu Uzala, Arsenyev and Siberian wilderness, therefore other characters play only a very limited role.

To conclude, this film absolutely impressed me and enchanted me and I am certain I will watch it again one day  even if it quite sad towards the end. This movie is a SPLENDOR! Enjoy!",1392768000,6,5089,4.740656851642129

And I found it every bit as enchanting as it had been years ago.  A simple story.  In 1905, a band of Russian surveyors are sent to far eastern Siberia to map the territory.  They take on a local native, Dersu, as their guide.  There ensues a multitude of adventures both beautiful and frightening.

I lost interest in the movie about 3/4 of the way through and then just never went back to it. I had the sense that I could see  that there was going to be some great misfortune happen to Dersu, maybe to the surveying crew also, and that there'd be some heroic sacrifice of some kind that would be bitter sweet. In other words, I thought I saw how it was going to go, and lost interest in using my time  to see it all play out. Maybe I was wrong. Anyone care to inform me?",1391212800,,711,4.144927536231884

592124,5,6303196543,"I saw ""Dersu Uzala"" with a friend many years ago at a film club. The audience was sparse, but we all felt we had seen one of the defining films of our lives. The mood in the room when the lights came on was euphoric. Strangers talked to each other about how moved they were by the character of Dersu, a wild man, a denizen of the forests and taiga of the far north, a person hardly differentiated from the world of animals, plants, natural events. If all of us were move and suitably impressed by Kurosawa's achievement so late in life, my friend was beside himself with wonder. From that day forth, Dersu Uzala is his touchstone film and Dersu himself is his spiritual companion. I just purchased this copy, wrapped it up and gave to him this week as a Christmas gift. The look on his face when he saw the title and realized what the gift was - sheer delight! But there was a second gift: I also purchased the memoirs of the Russian officer whose friendship with Dersu is the film's plot. That's when I realized my friend had forgotten this is a true story. The cover of the memoirs is a photograph of the two friends, Dersu the Wild Man of the Taiga and the Russian officer of the Civilized World. It's profoundly reassuring to know that a human being like Dersu really existed and lived in wholesome harmony with the natural world and that another human being like the Russian officer really existed and appreciated Dersu's goodness.

592216,4,6303196543,"DERSU UZALA came at a rough time in Kurosawa's life when he struggled with depression and getting studios to work with him. Based on this film, you never would have guessed it. Kurosawa went to Russia to make this film and the result is, of course, beautiful. This was Kurosawa's second color film and I believe his only color film shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Every shot is impeccably beautiful. On it's surface it's just about a friendship between a native hunter/guide and a Russian army explorer, but beneath that the film is about man vs. wild, community, sincerity vs. cynicism, and more. There's a lot going on. I will say the first half is more interesting than the second and the film as a whole is slower going, but this film is great. If you're a fan of Kurosawa, you'll love this.

Unfortunately, the Amazon Instant transfer is awful. Based on other reviews I've read, the DVD transfer isn't much better. Colors are awful, compression is everywhere, it's not anamorphic, basically every transfer sin that can be committed is committed here. Also personal preference, the only way to watch this from Amazon Instant is with the english dub. That's not how I watch foreign films. I'm a subtitle man. The dub is okay, but I would have preferred the subtitles. Unfortunately, it seems this is the best we have right now.

592269,4,6303196543,"Whine, Moan & Complain! Listen: This is Not a Criterion Edition- it never went through the digital corrections that Criterion put their Kurosawa films though. Does it have glitches?- Yes, but not extremely so. On a big screen they might be a bit bothersome video-wise; but the American English 'version' here is well done (with Kurosawa's great sense of the vernacular & humor) with just a few minor problems in one place; and there is a bit of washiness 'fog' in the video, BUT: first off this film was made in Russia way back then- the equipment was not what we get today. That Kurosawa was story/plot line driven is Never more evident than here! No ONE else in the history of cinema would have even dared attempt (much less convince crew & actors) to withstand the rigors of filming under the conditions that this film was made under. NO ONE! The plot & acting carries this film (in my opinion Kurosawa never made a 'movie', he only made films) into the realm of one of his greats. He was & IS The master of camera use (here a bit less than other of his work due to budget & conditions), but who else would film in Winter, in Siberia, and still come out with a masterwork of a story? That you see a 'credit' for Roger Corrman (as distributor?) at the end says a Lot about who runs Hollywood, then, and Now for that matter. The Hollywood 'suits' could learn a lot from Kurosawa, especially today- he took classic novels by the best writers in Any language, and adapted them to his audience & milieu, rather than have the director act as story/plot creator and film-ographer. 90% + plus of the utter crap out there today is a result of that lack, that and the great fear of Hollywood execs to try anything new! PS: as always the casting & acting is first rate & NO stunt men were used-Kurosawa always demanded & Got the best from his crew & actors/actresses; a measure of the regard in which they held him. 'Dersu' is so believable you cannot believe he was not an actor. Only Kurosawa could have gotten TOHO & the Russians to fund this, as a story/setting, it would seem 'un-filmable', period.
What's missing of course is a Criterion Edition-Steven Prince 'commentary'- which I wish were on All of Kurosawa's works- those in themselves are an entire course in film making. So buy Dersu- it'll sit on your shelf along with the Seven Samurai if for no other reason that it will make you unafraid of going out there & do your best with any equipment, under absolutely Any filming conditions!

I went to search for DVD version and as it turned there were two version.  This one (released by Ruscico) and the one released by King Video.  You can still buy one from King Video but from reviews given over there it is not a good copy.

The one released by Ruscico was exactly same as the one I saw at the theater.  It is just wonderful to be able to see it in DVD.  If Blu-Ray version comes out I will definitely buy it.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer carry the Ruscico version so searching auction site may be the only way for you to find a copy.

Click the title and it will show the price.  The problem here is that while you can purchase the DVD, the price is significantly high so if you have the financial ability to swallow the cost then it may be worth it to go for it.

They sell both PAL and NTSC version so make sure you pick the right one.

592272,5,6303196543,"In the early 1970s, Akira Kurosawa was already celebrated as a total genius and one of the most important movie directors ever. Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Federico Fellini, Roman Polanski, Robert Altman, Ingmar Bergman and many others are or were his devout fans. But at that moment everything seemed to be going wrong for him. Despised by his fellow countrymen, who accused him of making films to please Western tastes, unable to secure financing for his films, health failing, a suicide attempt, depression...

Hearing of that, an unlikely source asked him if he was willing to make a film for them: the Soviets. Without much choice and wanting to be productive again, Kurosawa accepted and went to Moscow. In spite of all the predictable ideological and political interference, it was at Mosfilm that he made this triumphal comeback and absolute masterpiece, which very deservedly won the 1976 Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film.

Kurosawa's flawless and perfectionist attention to the least aesthetic details, combined to the breathtaking wild landscapes of the Russian Far East, make this film a visually jaw-dropping experience from the first to the last shot. It is also impossible not to fall in love with the title character, a native hunter from a Siberian nomadic ethnicity, the Nanai (then called the ""Gold""), who taught an explorer from the Tsarist army in the first decade of the 20th century how to survive, interact and respect nature. And amid all that, a story of friendship, respect, maybe even Socratic love (without any undertone) between two men who were culturally worlds apart, but their humanity brought them together. The story is real, Dersu really existed and his story is told in the officer's memoirs, on which the screenplay was based.

Not only didn't ""Dersu Uzala"" get old after more than three decades, but it feels fresher than ever. Kurosawa seemed prescient of what would be in the world's agenda many years later. Ecology, rethinking of our relationship with nature? It's there. Inter-ethnic tolerance and respect? It's there. Solidarity rather than violence? It's there - nature itself is much more violent in this film than men are. But everything is presented with subtlety, without speeches, without arrogance, and especially without syrupy cheesiness. Or can you imagine Kurosawa making anything even remotely kitsch? And take the many unforgettable scenes, like the terrifying snowstorm and the symbolism of the Siberian tiger as a representation of the forces of nature themselves.

This Russian DVD edition has a somewhat disappointing image quality, especially for such a visually magnificent film, but it is guaranteed to be the integral original work.

The actor of the title character Uzala was just great. It's a beautiful movie-- takes you very close to the nature you may never get the time to see.

592316,3,6303196543,"Dersu Uzala (Akira Kurosawa, 1975)

As much as I understand the importance of Akira Kurosawa in the greater language of film, I have to say that I've never really gotten his movies the way other people seem to; Rashomon is a movie I've watched a number of times trying to glean what it is that makes it, as many critics would have it, one of the hundred finest films ever made, and I just can't wrap my head around it. It's a good movie, to be sure, but I guess I'm missing something. I felt the same way about Dersu Uzala, now that I've seen it for the first time; I enjoyed it well enough, but nothing about it struck me as being for the ages.

Uzala himself (Maksim Munzuk) is a woodsman, who makes his living trapping and serving as a guide in the wilds of Taiga. He is hired by Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin), a captain in the Russian army, as a guide, and the two form a friendship during their time together that is renewed on occasion as the two run into each other. The real plot of the story develops when Dersu Uzala develops cataracts; with his eyesight getting worse and worse, his continued survival in the woods becomes untenable, and so Arseniev offers to put up Dersu, who's never lived anywhere but the woods, in his house in the city. Cue culture clash.

Dersu Uzala won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1975, beating out such luminaries as Wajda's The Promised Land and Kumai's Sandikan 8. I'm glad I wasn't a member of the Academy at that time; that would've been a tough call. (For the record, I should mention I'm not a member now, either.) I'm relatively sure I would've gone for one of the others, though; as I said above, Dersu Uzala is a good film, interesting if a bit slow to get to the real meat of the matter, but nothing about it grabbed me in the way slow films sometimes do (a perfect example of this is the work of Bela Tarr, in which nothing at all happens most of the time, but I can't tear my eyes away from the screen). Kurosawa gives us interesting, well-acted characters in a fantastic framework, and with some of the more stunning scenery I've come across in recent months, but there's that ineffable something about Kurosawa's movies that I just don't grasp. And I still don't know why. ***",1219190400,3,2233,4.375903614457831

592394,5,6303196543,"Dersu Uzala is a memorable Russian film, a departure from one of movies' greatest directors, Kurosawa.  The film earned the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign film.  It is about survival within the force of nature and a commardiere of friendship, honor and duty.

During a topography expedition, Captain and few members of his troop embark into the Siberian wilderness and encounter an old man, Dersu Uzala, a nomadic tribesman  who offers to guide them, knowing they will not survive against the brutal conditions of nature as he says, ""man small before the face of nature"".  Beginning in 1902, the story is told through the writings of the Captain, and the time jumps to five years later.

During their trek, they encounter exhaustion, severe frost, hunger, and on a frozen marshland, the Captain and Dersu are separated from the others traveling on a boat.  Dersu, with his survival knowledge saves the two from the bitter blowing cold by creating a hut out of the grass.  Here, Captain believes Dersu saved his life.  Dersu exhibits great insight and foresight.

In the later years when they meet up again, they encounter Chinese bandits, thick fog, traps, and surviving in rapid waters.  Then life changes for Dersu, when he is forced to kill a tiger.

The imagery is spectacular with glowing sunrise, setting of the moon, cold blowing snow, dense fog, rapid waters, marshland, images of shadow and light in the jungle and the seasonal changes.  Through this journey, two men endure a friendship to be remembered.

We also see what the march of progress can do to native peoples. Just as 19th century Americans traveling West encoutered Native Americans, so too did 19th century Russians encounter tribal peoples as they journeyed East.

592399,5,6303196543,"DERSU UZALA (1975) stands proudly alone in the vast Akira Kurosawa canon of cinema. It is his only film in Russian, and it is filmed with his unique Asian perspective, giving the character of Dersu much more depth than a Soviet director would have managed. This film saved Kurosawa's career, and possibly his life. His attempted suicide after the critical failure of his feature, DODES' KA-DEN (1970), made him a pariah. He struggled for years before he finally went to Russia's Far East to film. Even considering the Oscar DERSU UZALA won, it took him several more years to finance and mount KAGEMUSHA (1980). Thank the cinema gods then he was able to go on and direct great films like RAN (1985), and DREAMS (1990).

Cinematographer, Asakazu Nakai, his long-time collaborator on films like STRAY DOG (1949), IKIRU (1952), THE SEVEN SAMURAI (1954), THRONE OF BLOOD (1957), and RED BEARD in (1965), accompanied him to Russia to work with Soviet cinematographers Fyodor Dobronravov and Yuri Gantman. The photography in DERSU UZALA gave it its authenticity, its grandeur and scope, filling the screen with the taiga and tundra, vast jungle-like forests, and frozen wastelands.

Maksim Munzuk was the embodiement of Dersu, short, powerful, wise in the ways of the wilderness, yet naive, superstitious, and nearly illiterate. He was man constantly on the move, trapping, hunting, fishing --a man without a home, being ""at home"" wherever he found himself when night fell --a man without a family as smallpox had robbed him of his wife and children. His tribe, the Goldi, were nearly extinct from disease and interbreeding. As he neared the end of his days, so did much of his world. Civilization chewed up Nature like a paper shredder. Much of the taiga today is held in nature reserves and parks. This marvelous film reasonates with me like a cross between THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS and BRAVE NEW WORLD.",1184025600,3,1898,4.946708463949843

As always, Kurosawa's versatile talents are on full display in ""Uzala,"" which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1975.",1183420800,,565,5.505747126436781
592401,5,6303196543,"Fans weaned on the ""usual set of masterpieces"" by Akira Kurosawa will no doubt be taken by surprise to see one without a samurai theme and without his favorite leading man Toshiro Mifune, and certainly the themes that have pervaded the themes of most films.

Dersu Uzala, a Russian production filmed entirely in Siberia was Kurosawa's comeback film (and what a comeback, with a 1975 Best Foreign film Oscar) after a low period that saw him even attempt suicide.

Dersu Uzala is a Goldi (Mongolian) jungle gypsy with a heightened sense of jungle survival knowledge who befriends an army captain on a Siberian mapping expedition and saves them from possible extinction without his help. In return, Dersu the jungle man is taken to the city to live with the Captain - a place where his survival instincts are worthless against a civilization that lives by modern technology and use of the gun.

In the ultimate analysis, its an essay on the nature of man Vs the context of modern civilization  - how pristine survival instincts programmed since the dawn of human civilization is being progressively degraded and lost by the cocoon that creature comforts of modern civilization have spun created around us. There is definite sense of despair and  nostalgia about this in the message of this film.

A must watch film with a serious message about humanity and most of all, about friendship and gratitude.

PS: Stay tuned for my next review of a '70s hit comedy that has an uncanny  solidarity to the theme of Dersu Uzala. Yes, that one caught me by surprise too !.

However, this is a review of the DVD which is TERRIBLE!  Scratches, lines, pops, hairs, dust, etc mars almost every scene.

I particularly think the RUSCICO version produced by the Russian government is great, even though it suffers from the same flaw that others have mentioned with the Criterion version -- the print needs to be painstakingly restored to fix the spots where the colors have degraded over the course of time. It's worth it.

The Russian version has three (very good) dubbed languages and about 14 subtitled languages, but in the end the important thing is just to be able to hear the actors in Russian and understand them.

The story itself is slower than a lazy river, which is great for me but somebody who's waiting for things to blow up won't last long enough for Dersu to appear a few minutes into the movie. This is basically a buddy movie where all the buddies do is hike around through the woods and survey the lay of the land while trying not to let nature kill them (although there are brushes with a couple of criminal elements). It's a great movie for nature lovers and people who want to believe in a more humane era for Russia.",1180137600,8,1218,4.452914798206278
592444,5,6303196543,"This is one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one that is part of a very select phenomenon.  Kurosawa couldn't find financing in Japan during this time period, so he turned to the USSR for financing of this film, one of only two films (the other being Dodeskaden) that Kurosawa made in the 1970's.  The film is so quinessentially Russian, both in its language, themes, and character.  You'd swear it was directed by a Russian, but Kurosawa is obviously not Russian.  Only a few filmmakers (Kubrick for A Clockwork Orange, Tarkovsky for The Sacrifice, and most recently, Eastwood for Letters from Iwo Jima) have managed to submerge themselves in a foreign culture and make a film worthy of it.  I originally saw this film in a pan and scan version, and it had absolutely no impact.  Seeing it widescreen on DVD is so much better.  It's a completely different film, and a great one at that.  Another great thing about this film is the subtitles.  Dersu Uzala, the main character, speaks broken Russian, and the subtitles are translated in broken English (even though you understand them).  Dersu is not stupid, just not educated.  Educated people can be quite stupid at times, so having a degree doesn't mean you're smart.  Some have complained about the poor quality of the transfer.  The film was shot in 70mm Sovcolor.  Soviet film stock was notoriously inconsistent.  Many films shot in the former Soviet Union had many problems with out of date film stock, or film stock that had already deteriorated, but due to bureacracy, a lot of times directors would shoot with the bad footage and later learn it was defective (Tarkovsky had this experience on the film Stalker, and it forced him to start over from scratch after shooting a large part of the film).  The film itself is magnificent, with some incredible widescreen photography and wonderful vistas of Siberia (contrary to popular belief, some of Siberia is lush forest land, it's not all tundra and ice).  It's one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and it's a good illustration of his later style (longer takes, slower pace, more meditative), which I like more than his earlier work.",1180051200,5,2139,4.832417582417582

592446,5,6303196543,"First of all, I would like to write that this film needs to be restored by CRITERION, it definitely needs a major makeover. Also, while I have this in my collection; I did not really appreciate this film when I first viewed it. I do now. This was the first film by director Akira Kurosawa after his attempted suicide. And although he was still in a state of depression when doing this film, the film succeeds; and when I viewed it again last night, after a several year period, I thought about Kurosawa, and how different this film was from his other films. And maybe this was due to his state of mind at the time. Moreover, I found the film to be excellent. The film is set in the forests of Siberia in the 19th-century. The film centers on the friendship of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin) and an inhabitant of the frozen Taiga, named Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk).

Those who are used to Kurosawa's earlier films, such as RASHOMON, YOJIMBO, or SEVEN SAMURAI among others; do not compare this film to those ones, this is a distinctly different film. Furthermore, it is a great film worthy of any of his previous ones. This is a story about both friendship, and growing old. In the film, a Russian captain, Arseniev, begins a friendship with a man of the Taiga named Dersu Uzala. Dersu even rescues Arseniev when he is trapped in a frozen lake. For the Russian Captain, he is out of his elements, and relies on Dersu many times. However, Dersu knows his elements: Or does he? For Dersu, survival in the frozen wastes of Siberia is a way of life. Yet when Dersu kills a tiger, it's like a curse has been placed on him. His tribe believes that a ghost, Kanga, rules the Taiga, and therefore he will be punished. Dersu begins to have difficulty killing his prey, and even his eyesight worsens.

Finally, when Captain Arseniev sees the horror one night on Dersu's face, [who is expecting Kanga to send the Tiger to kill him], he offers Dersu to come to his hometown. During the Russian expedition in Siberia, these two men have developed a very strong friendship and affection for one another. As the viewer you cannot help but empathize with Dersu, knowing that he is the one who is no longer comfortable in his elements. Moreover, you begin to see that as an old man, Dersu no longer is safe in his once comfortable  Taiga. Also, the friendship these two men share is very strong. This film is great, and for those who have viewed it once before, and maybe did not particularly care for the film, try watching it again. Maybe because I am getting older I am seeing things I did not when I was younger. This film is a truly great Kurosawa film. Plus the cinematography, beautiful scenes, and music are outstanding. One big caveat, however, is that the film needs to be restored. It deserves more treatment than it has been given at present. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5]",1168732800,8,2878,4.541425818882466

This film won the Foreign Film Oscar, so it was sort of a comeback film for Kurosawa. Based on a real story, the movie is set in the Russian far east in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Basically, is about a Russian captain and explorer befriending a native called Dersu Uzala (of the ethnic group which today is referred as the nanai), after he saves his live during a snow storm. Most of the movie then deals with their friendship as they explore and hunt together in the wilds of eastern Siberia. When Dersu's vision no longer makes him able to hunt, the Russian brings him to the city to live with his family. But for a man who has always lived in the woods, urban civilization seems very strange, so he pleads to the captain to return to his native place. Unfortunately, time has not passed in vain, and in the woods he will find an early demise. It's a great adventure film, though one wonders if the relations between the Russians and the Siberian natives were always as friendly as this movie shows. One detail: though some of the movie was shot on location, other parts are shot in a studio, pretending to be a forest, and sadly, that shows.

592449,5,6303196543,"As I still have VHS capabilities, this review does not concern itself  with the technical problems with the Kino DVD.  I thank those who have dealt with this issue, because Dersu deserves to be experienced in the finest print and on as large a screen as possible, because the film could be subtitled: THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE WRIT LARGE.  For film buffs, of course, cinematography is one of these, and Dersu remains unsurpassed for its integration of narrative and landscape (one imagines that Herzog and Wenders must have reviewed this film endlessly).  Kurosawa's cinematic technique here is close-up: simple, direct, intimate, yet one gets this deep feeling of comprehensiveness. In one of the grand sequences of the film, when Dersu says ""The sun is a good man. The moon is a good man."", and Kurosawa gives us the corresponding visuals, the whole organic unity of life seems clearly presented to us, in a moment, at once palpable and ultimately mysterious, comprehensible yet inevitably esoteric, knowable for a day or a night, but secret in its origins and ends. From an intellectual perspective, the film examines the meeting of the two basic cultures of this world: modern, ""scientific"" eurocentric peoples, and ancestral, aboriginal or 'first peoples': those who seek to alter their environment and those who strive to live within the given.  The environment, in this case, is stark and unforgiving: Siberia.  Mostly, however, the film discusses a topic rarely (as strange as it seems) the subject (at least devoid of romantic or sexual overtones) of many films nowadays: friendship.  Based on a true story, the film details the friendship which develops between two people from opposite orientations in virtually every sense.  Neither can exist in the other's world, but for a brief, spectacular moment they are brought together to show us how we can live together, and why we should.  Nowhere else have I seen perhaps the noblest of human endeavors treated with such dignity and grace. The results are sublime.  In my opinion, Kurosawa's best (which is not merely very good), and a film I wish everyone could have the privilege of seeing.",1159315200,15,2157,5.033707865168539
592450,5,6303196543,"I keep coming back to this movie as one of the great examples of cinematic story-telling.  Kurosawa's methods are perfectly suited to the medium.  The movie is neither literary nor theatrical.  It is perfectly cinematic: the camera does what narration would in other art-forms: it sets the stage, it opens us to the characters, it transports us from the sofa to Siberia... One can almost smell the forest duff, hear the drone of mosquitoes, feel the stabbing cold of the Siberian snow-storm.  The snow-storm scene must be among the greatest ever filmed: immediate, frightening, unflinching; the desperation of the characters is palpable, and I felt as fully invested in their moment of terror as I ever have in any film.

These sensations are unsettlingly real, made more so by the totally convincing rendering of the two main characters, a Soviet [or Czarist?] army captain and the Siberian guide he befriends.  There is little dialogue, and little dramatic acting per se.  Rather, the actors seem to inhabit their roles almost to the complete exclusion of the camera and the director, as though he had happened upon these two in the woods, and managed to film them out of sight in the trees.  I'd swear their joy at reuniting after a separation is totally unfeigned.

592452,3,6303196543,"I'll be honest.  I think most people who reviewed the movie here, as well as many critics, over-rate this movie by a large margin.

Kurosawa's 1977 Oscar winner is a good movie, but it's really unbalanced between the first hour and the second.  In the first hour (which also constitutes the first half), after enduring a slow start, we are treated to a delightful and soon endearing character named Dersu Uzala.  (This movie is supposedly based on a true story.)  Dersu is a local old man who offers to help a small exploration team from the Russian military, which at the time was continuing to forcefully occupy land belonging to others.  In introducing and building up the character, Kurosawa employs simple and straightforward story-telling to make the audience bond instantly with the character.  The actor who played Dersu was simply perfect for this part.

Unfortunately, the second hour/part of the film, which recounts the second meeting between the Russians and Dersu, is far less successful.  It's rather boring and plain.  The stories here are no longer interesting.  It's not because the story of Dersu's fears of the forest spirit or his declining vision that's not interesting.  It's because, somehow, Kurosawa's direction ran out of steam.  If the movie had ended up at the 1 hour 20 minute mark, it would have been a story I'd watch over and over again.  But the second half felt like forced and melodramatic, esp. with the part where Dersu moves to the city with the captain.

In the first half, Dersu is this short, old Asian man who we can take a liking of instantly.  In the second half, he's more of a liability, and definitely no longer likeable.  I suppose we are supposed to feel pity for him, but the story, and the direction, fail miserably in conveying his sad conditions.  The ending is too abrupt for my taste, and the fact that the actor who played the captain showed no emotions leaves a lot to be desired for the ending.  It's like a symphony suddenly ending without a concluding, reassuring note.

Overall, it's a film worthy of watching for film lovers.  Like they say, it's a story about humanity, about friendship, about people who are not corrupted by modern materialism, racism, and religious feneticism.

I rank this movie up there with ""The Seven Samurai"". It's a beautiful story with great characters, beautiful sceneries, and a touching ending. It's basically in my top ten movies of all time! If you haven't seen it, check it out, be patient and the reward will come. I think that's the key. With any good foreign movie, you have to give it ""patience"". Let the images go through you, transform you to another time and place. That's what you get when you watch poetry at work. It's a painting; all the colors and movements form to give you the whole picture. And this movie is like that. It moves you. I promise--you'll remember it for the rest of your life!",1073520000,8,987,4.398907103825136
592542,5,6303196543,"I don't agree with the complaints about picture quality. Our copy had excellent picture and sound except for the first 30 seconds or so. The cogent subtitles were highly visible yellow below the wide screen picture. We have the ""Delux Letterbox Edition"". Maybe the bad picture quality was in earlier Kino releases.
The story is intriguing. I was moved to laughter, joy, and almost to tears throughout this wonderful film. The themes of aging, friendship across cultures, loyalty, and individual and societal transformation are handled with typical Kurosawa profundity, insight, and pathos. Perhaps more than any other director, Kurosawa gets the little details right, especially regarding relationships and the way a person's motivation and behavior are determined to a large degree on their history and their quest for wholeness. Dersu Uzala often reminded me of Kurosawa's early films in this regard.
The cinematography was wonderful. The Siberian wilderness was shown as a beautiful and compelling Garden of Eden, soon to be destroyed by the evils of civilization. Ironically, one of the protagonists was a surveyor, a decent and caring man whose survey was to be used to destroy the wild paradise he and Dersu traveled through.

In fairness, I suppose that Kino puts out films that aren't likely to have the popular appeal (and price tags) of those issued by Criterion.  But that's no excuse for taking non-anamorphic transfers of 'Scope films from lousy prints. At least they didn't put in hard subs this time.",1053475200,17,354,4.693548387096774

The film was cast and directed to perfection (especially the two lead roles), and I think everyone should have it in their DVD collection. Without going over the fine descriptions of the storyline by other reviewers, I'll just say that it is both gripping and heart warming, as well as a great family experience. My only reservation was with the quality of the transfer. Don't get me wrong, Kino did a pretty good job of transferring the film to disk, and I think the DVD is a far better format than VHS, but I would love to see this film on a Criterion DVD. Maybe I'm spoiled, but a Criterion DVD looks like it was shot on the latest film, and transferred with utmost care to preserve every subtlty.
 The Kino DVD still shows the occasional hair and film bubble inherent to a well used film reel after 25+ years in a box. Contrast and color saturation are probably not up to par compared to a proper restoration, but I didn't see any real problems here. Maybe the latest disks are better than the early ones, as I cannot agree with the reviewer who panned the film as something awful. This DVD isn't bad, it's just that there are some who could have done it better. Buy it, enjoy it.",1043625600,11,1228,4.362445414847161
592546,5,6303196543,"No question Kurosawa was a master director and here he proves it as he masters perhaps his toughest task to date, the wilds of Siberia.  Taken from a Russian novel that Kurosawa had wanted to film for quite a while, Dersu Uzala is many things at once.  It's the story of man against nature and man against himself while at the same time man fusing with nature and with oneself and the comparisons that can be made inbetween.  The character of Dersu is perhaps as unique as any that has ever been included in cinema.  He is completely unique from any of his Hollywood 'mountain man' cohorts.  The photography in Dersu Uzala is breathtaking.  From all the color of autumn to the desolation and bleakness of winter, the cinematography is top notch.  The ending of this film will stay with you for a long time afterwards.  A very moving film.",1037404800,4,838,4.54

I mean, make no mistake; this is a Kurosawa, but the quality sometimes looks worst than a bootlegged VHS. Kurosawa's older movies like Hidden Fortress and Seven Samurai look much better than this and those movies are 44 and 48 years old respectively, COST LESS and are black and white.
Sadly this isn't the first Kurosawa movie I've seen been massacred by a poor DvD transfer. Remember Ran? That DvD was a utter disgrace. So was Madadayo and Sanjuro. I'm so sick of these companies seeking a quick profit so they take works of art and destroy them with half assed ports and then charge over inflated prices on top of all that. It makes me sick. And then there are movies like Kagemusha, Ikiru and Throne of Blood (some of the greatest movies ever made) that have yet to be released on DvD and that I find completely unacceptable.
I'm sorry this is beginning sound like a rant but no way is this half assed transfer worth that much money. The movie gets 10 stars but the DvD gets NONE.",1032480000,151,1157,4.514285714285714
592619,5,6303196543,"Dersu Uzala is the name of an indigenous hunter living in the cold and wilds of Siberia.  The main character is a russian officer assigned to head an expedition of soldiers and cartographers to survey some of the Siberia's unexplored areas.  The first night they settle down and build a campfire Dersu happens upon them and they offer him some food.  In broken russian the main character talks with Dersu and hearing how well he knows the terrain he asks Dersu if he'd tag along with them and serve as their guide.  Dersu accepts for the company and for a handful of bullets which he'll receive later (as ammunition was scarce in the wilderness).  The rest of the story plays out like a modern day version of ""Deer Slayer"" with Dersu playing the knowledgable and noble savage and the main character playing the slightly naive but capable civilized gentleman.  Kurosawa's hand can be seen in the long still sequences that show the vastness and beauty of nature.  Siberia is used as a surrogate for the majestic untamed wilderness and forests of Fennimore Cooper, ironically showing civilization moving eastwards instead of westwards.  The story moves very slowly with intermittant voice over sequences by the main character describing what happens as if he were a narrator from a book, a very un-Kurosawa-like quality.  Kurosawa doesn't usually use main-character voiceovers.  He usually shows the action or uses wordless plainly readable editted sequences.  Dersu Uzala is his most conventional film; a must-see for the avid Kurosawa buff but maybe a movie you can pass on by if you're looking for something more in the vein of a classic Kurosawa work.",1031529600,3,1652,4.949275362318841

The film is shot almost entirely outside in the Siberian wilderness, featuring some of the most stunningly bleak landscapes I have ever seen captured on film, and is so brialliantly acted that it seems more like documentary about real people than actors reading a script. This Russian-language film is one of Kurosawa's lesser known gems and shows his directing at its best, when he was at the height of his mature talent. In its own way this film has a lot to say about the plight of native peoples and the high price of modernity. Not to be missed.",1017878400,2,797,4.782608695652174

The previous reviews describe this magnificent film quite well, so I won't add to it, but offer instead a story. About twenty years ago, my wife and I took her four small children, only one of whom could read at the time, to an art theater showing of Dersu. We knew this was a little risky; the response one might rightly expect from children that age to a long, slow moving, subtitled film would be squirmy boredom and complaining, but that is not what happened at all. Kurosawa's storytelling genius captured even these very young minds; they remained attentive throughout the entire film and despite the the fact that three of them had no way of knowing what the characters were saying, enjoyed it to the end.

The story focus on the relationship between a russian captain (played by Yuri Solomin) and a Goldi hunter (Maxim Munzuk), and its development, nature, and consequences. It is a very moving picture, about true feelings, emotions, and above all friendship.  As far as the DVD is concerned, the quality is disappointing, especially when one takes in consideration the price.

592718,5,6303196543,"Dersu Uzala is one of my favorite films, a film to be cherished for its subtlties and how they eventually lead to larger truths. Very few films are made on the themes of compassion and subtle bravery. Yuri Solomin, the Russian captain  who leads a small squad of soldiers into the Siberian wilds to survey the land, is one of the most memorable portraits of compassion ever put on film. His relationship to Dersu (Maksum Muzuk)is almost totally intuitive and wordless. The captain knows almost from the onset that this Goldi wilderness hunter is special and step by step the captain and his men learn gentle and harsh lessons from this marvelous woodsmen, how to survive in almost impossible weather conditions, how to act like a man, with dignity and compassion. This was one of Kurosawa's last films. It was a difficult time in his life when it was reported he attempted suicide and that George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola help him get this movie made, knowing that this lengendary director should not be neglected. The cinematography goes much farther than nature specials and some scenes, like the distant icy landscapes lit by firelight, create a beautiful, unforgettable vision of that wild place. I guess you could call this an action picture, but Kurosawa gives us more, dives deeper to show us the day to day wonders, the harsh existence, and sadness when one is taken out one's element and put in an alien one. Dersu Uzala is a brilliant, lasting vision of man humbled by nature but respecting nature, and then bringing it back in a poem of reflection. The understated ending, so subtle, almost mute, is one of the most moving I've ever watched. All viewers should cherish this film for so many strengths and be glad that we had such a master film maker as Kurosawa among us. He will be greatly missed by all. Highly recommended for all ages, a masterpiece that will test and reward the audience like the harshness of the Siberian landscapes it so boldly portrays.",973382400,46,1977,4.747093023255814

Rest assured that the Kurosawa camera for focus on the visual  splendor that the stark winter landscapes and the dense forests have to  offer. Just as the wilderness offers a majestic stillness, so too do the  widescreen compositions. The elegance and simplicity of style are directly  related to the subject matter.

The Turgenev here he was referring to (the author of ""Sketches from a Hunter's Notebook"")  was perhaps the earliest and most influential (compare e.g., his ""Big,  Two-Hearted River"") in drawing out and committing to eternity  observations of nature. This movie, surprisingly timeless, brilliantly  arranged like a landscape painting, and very true in its characterization,  does in fact look like a Tolstoyan tale had it been directed by Turgenev.  The movie centers around a Japanese guide who, circa 1900, leads and  teaches a group of soldiers through the near-lunar area of remote Russia.  It is a telling movie, an epic as large as ""Lawrence of Arabia""  in scope, yet as unassuming (and unpretentious) as the best of nature  films; something for which Kurosawa always had a talent for capturing. It's  very quiet yet telling, the whispering voices of the group as they journey  heard loud yet prominent.

A translation of  his work is available again in English and I recommend it as highly as the  film.  From it you learn such interesting tidbits as that Dersu was a blond  (and if I remember correctly, even blue-eyed) Goldi.
