The only thing we weren't 100% crazy about was that after about 1/2 way through the DVD they start to repeat the snowglobes and show the same ones over and over, instead of more new ones.  But it's kind of a DVD to play in the background anyway, perfect for parties or while you're decorating the tree.  Anyone who likes snowglobes will love it!",1360540800,,412,4.394736842105263
8232673,5,B000YGFKXM,"This unique DVD brings over two dozen Viennese snow globes to your TV set.  The beautiful and colorful globes--some have religious figures in them; other are secular--are all in swirls of sparkling snow with a variety of Christmas songs in the background.  I've never seen snow globes in this way; they fill the TV screen, and the lighting is exquisite and ever-changing. The effect is both relaxing and entrancing.

What a great addition to holiday decor, and what a great gift for youngsters and adults.  My wife and I have already ordered ten to give to friends and family for Christmas.

The entertaining extras are a bonus.  We see how this unusual DVD was filmed and learn about the invention of the snow globe in Vienna a hundred years ago.",1194825600,9,747,4.707692307692308
