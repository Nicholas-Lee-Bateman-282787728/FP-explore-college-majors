4069841,3,B003517UW2,"Even though aspects of the story presented in this first feature by Mr. Alvarez seem somewhat implausible, other elements of the plot feel so sincere and honest that I would say overall this a very successful film.  The fact that it's based on a true story actually makes it all the more interesting, but I wonder if what we see in the film is entirely based on truth or, as is the case with many films based on true stories, the director took ""creative liberties"" with the truth.  Whatever the case, the real shining glory of this movie is the strong performance of Brian Geraghy.  He's a young actor with a very bright future.  I completely bought into his portrayal of a very shy and sexually dysfunctional writer.  So, kudos to all involved in this labor of love and I strongly encourage readers of this review who have not seen the film to check it out - I think you will really enjoy it.",1280620800,2,893,4.420731707317073
4069842,5,B003517UW2,"Kyle Patrick Alvarez' directorial debut, 'Easier with Practice' is an incredible milestone for such a young director. It is a must-see Indie film for everyone. Insightful love story full of humor, sadness, laughter, twists and turns. Based on a true story on the life of writer Davy Rothbart while on the road promoting his short stories.  No wonder Alvarez  won 'New Director, Someone to Watch', at the Independent Spirit Awards 2010.",1278460800,,435,5.112676056338028
4069843,2,B003517UW2,"This movie is fine for indie lovers.  The acting was good.  However, for mainstream movie viewers, the plot will be too slow, the twist will be too far-fetched, and the lack of an ending, while ultimately predictable and believable, will still be unsatisfying.",1277510400,2,260,5.023255813953488
4069844,5,B003517UW2,"Davy Mitchell (Brian Geraghty) is a not very successful author on a road trip with his brother trying to sell copies of his first collection of short stories.  This unglamorous trip consists primarily of giving readings to unenthused audiences at book stores throughout the southwest.  While in Gallup, New Mexico, Davy is relaxing in his hotel room when he receives an unexpected phone call.  A woman identifies herself as Nicole and says that she wants to have phone sex.  The somewhat dweebish and socially inept Davy at first is hesitant to play along.  However, when he reluctantly has phone sex with Nicole, he finds that he enjoys it, leading to a series of calls.  Soon, he considers Nicole to be his girlfriend, even though they have never met or even exchanged pictures.  He begins to want more.

""Easier with Practice"" is a terrific indie gem that explores modern day alienation.  When he's surrounded by people, Davy feels alone and overwhelmed; only by escaping through his cell phone calls to a basically anonymous woman can he feel a connection to someone.  Gotta love modern day technology and the changes it brings to social relationships!  The movie is anchored by a first-rate performance by Brian Geraghty (""The Hurt Locker""), who successfully captures the loneliness and social awkwardness of this character.  The normally baby-faced actor sports a beard and glasses, and this physical transformation allows the normally handsome actor to morph into his character.  More importantly, Geraghty isn't afraid of appearing vulnerable and even pathetic at times, which allows the somewhat strange story to feel complete believable.  It's truly compelling and award-worthy acting.

First time director and co-writer, Kyle Patrick Alvarez, does some nice subtle work here.  Keeping the direction and story simple really works for the film.  The screenplay was written by Alvarez based on an at-least-somewhat-true story that appeared in GQ Magazine and written by Davy Rothbart (editor and publisher of the fascinating Found Magazine).  However, don't let the somewhat questionable source material scare you away; ""Easier with Practice"" is an original, funny, and at times heart-breaking story.  Some people may dislike the ending (which relies on a bit of a twist); it was a bit of a disappointment, but for me it certainly didn't negate all of the fine work that came earlier.",1271808000,10,2392,5.198433420365535
4069845,5,B003517UW2,"With no dependence on Mad Hatters or Blue Aliens jumping out at you, Easier With Practice commits to a rare element seldom seen in Cinema of late, story and humility. Easier With Practice is a film for people who love real movies made by people who love real movies and it shows. The tight-knit fascinating characters slowly unravel in such a pace that we feel their evolution at the same pace they do. Director, Kyle Patrick Alvarez and the talented cast are able to give the characters a rare humility seldom seen any more, whether in mainstream or independent film.

Other reviewers have already adequately explained the story so I will not. I will only say that with a brilliant young cast; an original, warming, and often-funny story; and a hip soundtrack Easier With Practice is touching, entertaining, contemporary and simply well done. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even pick up the phone and call that special someone.",1270512000,15,933,4.867924528301887

4069847,5,B003517UW2,"It's a rare thing indeed for a truly unique story to get the funding to be made into a movie. Sure you can get your recycled ideas in 3D filled with big name celebrities retreading the same water that has been run through a million times before, but what's the point? There's a reason Easier With Practice exists and that is to show the world and movie going public that there is still some humanity left out there. It's not on some distant planet, but here, on the other end of a telephone.

See what independent film fans and festival goers are already discovering. A movie with a true heart, a unique story, and is made by people that LOVE cinema, Easier With Practice.",1265587200,15,672,4.419354838709677

As for the criticism regarding the original story on which this is based; I intentionally did not read it in order to judge the film on it's own merits. I wasn't put off in the least by the ending. I did watch the additional features in which the source author was interviewed. He was a bit of a tool, but the director has taken his story and created something quite moving.

The blurbs that describe it as a story about phone sex do it somewhat of a disservice.

8388592,3,B003517UW2,"Easier with Practice (Kyle Patrick Alvarez, 2009)

There is a lot about Easier with Practice to like; it feels like (and, really, it is) the kind of story that a stranger sitting next to you in the bar, with whom you've struck up a conversation because there's nothing better to do and the TV is turned to baseball yet again, tells you out of the blue in order to get it off his chest. That feeling carries through into the film realm very well, at least it does in this picture. The problem is that, as the story goes on, you get a very distinct feeling that perhaps the nice guy sitting next to you is maybe not quite as nice as he may have at first seemed. Now, it's entirely possible to paint this in a good lighthe's being as honest as he can be about his feelings and reactions to the situation in which he finds himself, and any therapist worth his or her salt will tell you that you can't effectively process this sort of stuff without being entirely honest with yourself. On the other hand, when you show it to outsiders, to people who weren't there, the urge to whitewash things, to make yourself look better, is sometimes best followed. (That it might well have changed the ending of the story here is irrelevant.)

As we open, Davy Mitchell (ATM's Brian Geraghty), a budding novelist, is on media's most depressing book tour with his brother Sean (Pulse's Kel O'Neill). They've financed the entire thing themselves, they're halfway across the country, they're near-broke, and they're not selling anything out of that trunkful of books. (As a side note, the movie is based on a GQ article by Davy Rothbart, who had a version of this story actually happen to him while he was touring Found exactly like this. I found that bit the most believable part of the story, for those of you reading this somewhere where the book title is a link to my review of Found.) One night, in a generic, nameless motel, he gets a call from breathy-voiced Nicole (Black Rock's Katie Aselton). They have phone sex, which eventually develops into a relationship. Nicole refuses to meet Davy in the flesh, which leads to the questioncan you have a relationship with someone you have never seen?

One of the movie's problems is that that question has been a kind of ridiculous one since, oh, two or three years after the world wide web went global (for those of you too young to remember, that happened in 1993). Which is not to say it can't still be askedthere is a movie that was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar this very morning that deals with the exact same question (Jan. 16, 2014, and Her, for the record). And maybe Alvarez, turning in his first feature, thought the story resonated more because it asks the same question with older tech (the relationship is carried on entirely by phone). That is important given an hour and a half long movie based on a four-page magazine article, because you've got to have something to fill up all that time before you get to the Big Twist(TM). Once you get past the gimmick and just see it as a relationship drama, things start cruising pretty smoothly again, but...then there's that Big Twist(TM). And when you put something like that out there, whether you filmed the truth or not, you're making a fictional piece based on a true story, and when you are doing that, it's worth considering that perhaps the true ending wasn't the right one. Your mileage may certainly vary, but to me, it wasn't, especially with the way Alvarez lensed that whole sequenceit's obvious to me that even he wanted the ending we didn't get. Did he feel constrained by the subject matter? That's the only explanation I can come up with.

Balancing this out are some very good performances. Geraghty reminds us why we like him in military-movie roles, if you soured on him after watching ATM. O'Neill makes a good comic foil, and even the minor parts are generally well-cast. If only Alvarez had had someone to slap some sense into him about that last sequence... ** ",1392940800,,3979,4.582865168539326
8388593,1,B003517UW2,"It's impossible to write a meaningful review of this movie without revealing the surprise ending. Anybody who leaves out the last 20 minutes is giving an unbalanced review that will leave many viewers feeling angry and betrayed if they see the movie based on that review. This is one of the three huge flaws in the movie, which I will elaborate below.

SPOILER ALERT:
PROCEED ONLY IF YOU ALREADY KNOW OR WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS MOVIE ENDS.

-------------

That's its first big flaw. This movie forces a conscientious reviewer to reveal the ending because it presents itself dishonestly as a gently romantic and sensitive character study when it's really a thriller. The ending betrays a viewer who has fallen under its sensitive, romantic spell with a shocking twist at the end. That is certainly a novel approach in movie-making, but it's also mean-spirited - almost as bad as secretly rewriting Winnie-the-Pooh so that it ends with Christopher Robin being gang-raped, but not warning parents before they read the book to their children.

This is as good a place as any to deal with the often-repeated excuse ""But it's a true story!"", because that's a lie. Even if the Davy Rothbart story the movie is based on is completely true (and there's good reason to doubt that), this movie distorts his story. (You can still read it on the GQ website, as I did; it's a badly-written and annoying story, by the way - hardly worth making into a movie.)

In the story, Davy had already suspected that ""Nicole"" might be a man, but he was having fun so he kept playing the phone-sex game. He was savvy and worldly, not at all the totally clueless, paralyzingly shy man the Davy in the movie is. It is unforgivable for the movie to create such a helpless, hopeless, rawly vulnerable character and then rip his slowly emerging, microscopic hopes to shreds the way this horrible movie does.

That's its second big flaw. It creates a preternaturally innocent, naive and vulnerable protagonist and then brutalizes him for entertainment.

The third, and to me the most unforgivable, flaw in this offensive movie is that the horror at the end of the tunnel is the fact that ""Nicole"" is really a gay man. Aaron is a man almost as shy and vulnerable as Davy is, but he's as unattractive as Davy is adorable. Davy is enormously appealing in his innocence and his sweet vulnerability - but Aaron is just a sleazy, lying, slimy creep.

Being gay is wonderful. I love it. I wouldn't be straight if you gave me a billion dollars. So having the monster who suddenly punches you in the gut at the end of a ""heartwarming"" movie be a gay man is deeply insulting. And then to have him be a creep, a pervert, a disgusting loser - in sharp contrast to Davy's charming, heartwarming (and straight!) loser - makes the insult even more appalling.

I cannot imagine what kind of person likes this movie. Certainly not any gay person; or any shy person, gay or straight; or anyone who cares about shy or gay people. The only audience I can imagine for this movie is severely abused women serving life sentences for murdering their abusers. They might be able to identify with the Davy this movie creates and then savages for entertainment by revealing that his secret love is a gay creep.

Don't blame it on Rothbart's story, as dumb and offensive as that story is; blame it on Alvarez's movie, which is far worse.",1377734400,2,3374,4.65546218487395
8388594,4,B003517UW2,"This unassuming indie really packs a punch.  A socially awkward guy starts getting anonymous calls from a mystery woman.

8388595,4,B003517UW2,"The movie is good, and the story interesting. It's well acted, and nuanced in a manner that is engaging. My only real complaint is that the main character Davy is much different than my perception of the real Davy (Rothbart, whose story this is), and I wish that wasn't so. Rothbart, in real life, is incredibly charismatic and has a positive presence. I think it'd have been interesting for the movie character Davy to reflect that, as it makes for a nice juxtaposition with the relationship with Nicole. People like Rothbart we think we know because he's so personable; the story of Nicole, and his inexperience in relationships is something we'd never expect. So why not have the character reflect that? I'd be 100 percent sold with the whole thing. And nice Rosebuds song at the end.",1360022400,,787,4.751824817518248
8388596,4,B003517UW2,"The twisty plot, supposeldy based on a ""true story,"" seems a little more plausible in light of the Manti-Lennay saga.",1358726400,,117,4.9
8388597,4,B003517UW2,"While far from a perfect film, this is a welcome reminder of why indie film-making is so important to U.S. cinema.  This is a story you haven't seen before, told in a bold and honest way, and willing to deal with complex emotions and no answers.

It all starts when a painfully shy, introverted writer on a pathetic book tour(accompanied by his brother) gets what seems to be a wrong number call from a sexy sounding strange woman that morphs into hot phone sex (all in one long multi-minute take).

The odd development of this intense and mysterious ongoing phone relationship, and how it effects Davy's lonely life makes up the rest of the
story, often going in delightfully or disturbingly unexpected directions (which I won't spoil here).

There are a couple of real weak spots. Some of the actors aren't quite up to the sophisticated subtlety of what Averez is going after. None of the cast  is 'bad' but great actors in certain choice roles could have brought out much more. There also a huge technical cinematic cheat that is so obvious, and so central to the story that it really alienated and angered me at a key moment.  I won't give away specifics here, but there had to be a more honest way to pull off the film's central twist.

But I'm still glad I saw the film, and I find it resonating with me the next day.",1350000000,,1323,4.4875
8388598,1,B003517UW2,"I hate to give a potentially 4 star movie 1 star but I had to. The ending was so horrible that it ruined what I felt for the entire movie.

I hate movies that spring a bad ending for shock value. I felt cheated because here I was going through Daly's journey with him, soaking up this fascinating love affair he's having with Nicole only to be pimp slapped at the end.

The ending was horrible, stupid, made no sense and the writers fell short if they were trying to impress.

Skip it because it builds you up, makes you root for Daly and Nicole only to be shot in the heart. This is a horrible love story.",1335398400,2,606,4.11864406779661
8388599,3,B003517UW2,"(( ""Davy"" is a Lead character who is experiencing unsettling emotional / behavioral problems.  More  significantly, he may be one who is yet to discover something extremely important about himself  ))

Whether this movie's background is just story-writer, Rothbart's own.....or whether it's part his life / part fiction.....or just a tale made up for a fictional Davy, is not important here.  Instead, what we need to focus on is that the Lead in this film, unquestionably, comes across as having had much more than the usual problems in relating to females.  Specifically, those females with whom he has attempted to become more than just friends.  Yet, with all other people in his life, Davy seems a likeable sort.....that is, when or if, they even realize he is around (he often seems ""Overlooked"").

I truly believe this film shows us, intentionally or not, that Davy is way more unhappy than we see on the surface.....and will likely always be unhappy. Why?  Because he is trying to live up to the ""norms"" which society is forever instilling in us.....and has never allowed himself to consider / experience other possibilities.  But what Davy (and all of us) need to discover is that when we have met a person who has grown all-important to us, a someone we have come to love and want to spend our future with....THEN, such things as our color...our sex...and other factors, should not be deciding ones.  If we BOTH want this THING we've built.....then that is the way it should be.

At film's end, Davy faces a choice.  Will it be one he allows outside pressures decide for him.....or will he make it based on his own inner desires?  My best advice to you, Davy, is to:  Follow your heart.....and never let fear of what you don't know keep you from finding the one of your dreams.  The ""Nicole"" we come to meet may very well be your best chance at happiness.

Final word for our Lead:  Oh, Davy, take that chance.....See if it will make you happy!

PS for Viewers:  Never let fear of what you don't know.....keep you from finding happiness.  (Is that what Davy is doing.....at the end?)",1309564800,,2093,4.710743801652892
