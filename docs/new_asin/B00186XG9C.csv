I am interested in Health Law (policy and advocacy) as well as public health, I therefore expected that if there 'truly' was a huge AIDS crisis, I would be aware of it. Boy was I wrong! Although I have studied some of the factors associated with HIV/AIDS, I certainly did not realize the magnitude of the crisis, the intricacies involved with the populations most vulnerable, and the different cultural factors associated with its spread internationally. For such a devastating disease, that can so easily and cheaply be prevented, I was not alone in finding myself completely outraged when the film concluded.

Since HIV/AIDS came into the mainstream's focus in the 1980s, I feel like the awareness and focus on this disease has died down, especially when compared to recent disease phenoms that affect a tiny fraction of the number of people worldwide--West Nile Virus, Mad Cow Disease, SARs, etc.

Although a documentary, this film --narrated by Will Smith, and with appearances/reactions by the Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan, Paul Farmer, Bono, and others -- is far from boring.  It will have you glued to the screen, and wanting to share it with everyone you care about.

I think this film would certainly be a good discussion starter, great for a fundraiser, or to watch with teenage kids, great in either an academic setting, or otherwise.",1223251200,4,1457,5.033195020746888
