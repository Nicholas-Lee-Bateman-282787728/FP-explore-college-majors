4047087,4,B0030VBGIQ,"I bought this edition of VOODOO MAN to enhance my Bela Lugosi collection. I would highly recommend it for the superior picture and sound quality of the Rifftrax release...not perfect, but by far the best print available. There are a couple of minor cuts in the film, but is far more complete than my older edition which was recorded on VHS tape off of television back in the late 70s then transfered to DVD. Another great feature of the Rifftrax release is the option of playing the movie with or without the riff commentary.

For Bela Lugosi fans you just can't beat the value of this release. Pick it up while you still can!",1292630400,8,626,4.491228070175438
4047088,5,B0030VBGIQ,"The only missing links here are the bots and the understory of MST.  The humor is still great, fast and multilevel.  Buy all your favs.  Worth every dime.",1288569600,2,154,4.428571428571429
4047089,4,B0030VBGIQ,"I didn't think I'd be able to see this film again.  Thankfully, you can play this without the commentary.  One minute of it was all I could take.  Sorry, but I find their humor sickening.  At least Legend didn't colorize it.  They claim the print has only one bad spot, but that is far from the truth.  There are a number of splices and instances of print damage, but it's still a watchable film that's great to see.  The print is a re-issue from Astor Pictures so the title card and end title are not original.",1276992000,7,511,4.260416666666667

The voodoo antics of the caterwauling George Zucco are priceless.",1401062400,,126,4.7727272727272725
4047093,4,B0030VBGIQ,"This film is a great find for Lugosi fans & those who love classic horror & B movies. Originally produced by poverty row film studio, ""Monogram"". This highly entertaining film was considered a minor classic...and thought to be lost. The print quality is very good. I highly recommend it to help complete your Lugosi/Classic Horror Library. You also have your choice of the original soundtrack or the Rifftrax commentary. This flick is great fun!",1396051200,,445,5.027027027027027
4047094,5,B0030VBGIQ,"Voodoo is a classic cheesey horror film which by itself is funny, but Mike, Kevin and a Bill make this hilarious!! My husband actually watched this one twice in one weekend; also a great one for Halloween time-take a break from the gore of modern day horro films and let yourself laugh with Voodoo!",1395273600,,298,4.537037037037037
4047095,5,B0030VBGIQ,"One of the better Rifftrax movies, starring Bela Lugosi.  Would recommend this even if you're new to the whole MST3K ""riffing"" concept as it's a pretty fun movie on it's own.",1382054400,,174,4.612903225806452
4047096,5,B0030VBGIQ,"This is your typical '40's horror/ voodoo type movie.  Bela Lugosi is good as the voodoo man but the real scene stealer is John Carridine.
 The rifftrax guys give it all they've got and it turns out to be very funny.",1360886400,,216,4.2439024390243905
4047097,5,B0030VBGIQ,"I can't believe that I had never even heard of this movie until I ran across the Rifftrax issue while cruising Amazon!  I mean, Bela Lugosi, George Zucco & John Carradine!?!?!  Holy mother of pearl, what a dream-team cast!
If you've seen any of my reviews, you know I love bad horror films, and this is right in the sweet spot!  The Rifftrax guys are definitely in fine form--they have golden material to work with here & they make the most of it.  I'm also really happy that the DVD gives the option of playing the movie straight, without commentary.  DO watch it that way at least once.
This release is an absolute masterpiece, and I can't do it justice.  JUST BUY IT!!!  DROP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND BUY IT!!!  It will make your life better!  You will be a happier person!  Give it to all your friends & strangers you meet on the street!  BUY IT!!!  I'M WATCHING!!  BUY IT NOW!!!",1323302400,10,885,4.355828220858895
4047098,4,B0030VBGIQ,"Rifftraxs Voodoo Man is lots of crazy fun,you can watch it with Mike,Kevin,and Bill or without,either way you will laugh. The print is pretty good and its a hard film to find,Bela Lugosi is trying to find a match for his wife to bring her back to living state from zombie land,he has a gas station who's manager is none other than George Zucco in the flesh,they kidnap women to find the perfect match to bring her back to living state,that's where the Voodoo comes in. John Carradine is a moron or drunk who grabs the women and beats the drum in the ceremony,you will laugh till you cry with this crazy no budget movie,so kick back and be ready for Voodoo Man.",1301961600,,660,4.373983739837398
4047099,4,B0030VBGIQ,"That being said, these are still pretty funny.  I have the box sets of MST3K and the Cinematic Titanic DVD's and they are a hoot.  These are right there - just a step below.  But don't let that stop you from buying these - they are, as stated previously, still pretty funny.",1301616000,,274,4.230769230769231
8386162,5,B0030VBGIQ,"The 'Rifftrax' is funny, but the REAL draw here is the superior print of 'Voodoo Man'. This poverty row classic is presented looking like the panther's pajamas, no balloons about it (and you can watch it without the Rifftrax comedy voiceover, though I recommend both).

John Carradine is in the cast sporting a shemp-like crop of hair that you won't forget soon. The entire cast of this one makes it a gem of 3 a.m. viewing with wayward pals, gals, gal-pals, or even a lonesome rainy saturday afternoon will do.

So bang the pots and pans, happy days are here again. Wash your hands and clap your knees. Wiggle your neck and cook an artichoke. Lugosi is here and you can reach out and touch him (if you want) because this edition will put him in your living room!",1506470400,,763,4.482014388489208
8386163,5,B0030VBGIQ,"Fun low budget early-to-mid-40's horror drek starring Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, and John Carradine.  Lugosi plays a doctor who has stranded-on-the-road girls kidnapped and brought to the house to help revive his wife.  Seems she's been in a living-dead waking coma for twenty years and hasn't aged a day.  Zucco plays Voodoo priest who plans to use mumble-jumble to revive Mrs. Lugosi.  He also runs a gas station on the side and mis-directs the girls in Bela's direction.  Carradine plays the sub-mental lunk who carts the girls to the dungeon.  The DVD has both the Rifftrax version and the non-Rifftrax version.  The Rifftrax version is extremely funny, in keeping with the MST3K tradition.  Both versions are very good quality and the film is cleaned up but needs further re-mastering.  Highly recommended",1499299200,,810,5.122137404580153

8386166,3,B0030VBGIQ,"When one of the characters in VOODOO MAN falls into a deathlike stupor, the viewer can sympathize. It's a long, tedious slog through the sort of creaky 1940s melodrama that popped up with numbing regularity (or maybe it just seemed that way) in MST3K's first season -- campy as hell, but more boring than funny. Bela Lugosi does his usual mad doctor routine; George Zucco is a gas station attendant with Shakespearean diction, who moonlights as a voodoo priest; John Carradine plays a gibbering idiot, and Tod Andrews is the impossibly dimwitted, ineffectual hero. Even with the riffing, the picture is still a chore to sit through, and rarely has 62 minutes ever felt so long.

As other reviewers have noted, this is the marginally shorter Astor re-release print, not the original Monogram release. Frankly, I wouldn't want to sit through VOODOO MAN even one minute longer than necessary.",1449619200,,889,4.966442953020135
8386167,5,B0030VBGIQ,Classic rifftrax stuff. The only downside... it's only an hour long. Aside from that grat stuff,1440028800,,95,5.0
8386168,5,B0030VBGIQ,"This Rifftrax is remarkable. The riffing is fun and well-paced. However, what makes this selection different is the movie itself. It is a clear film with little audio difficulty, a rarity in ""B reel"" films in the forties. The plot is coherent and executed with distinctly. What's more, this movie is fun. No one, not even Bela Lugosi, seem to take themselves seriously. Since they don't try to sell the movie, it's easy to buy into the experience.

This has become a rare film in the Rifftrax collection for me- a movie I enjoy as much without the riffing as with. If you're not sure about whether or not you'll enjoy it, I encourage you to give this a try.",1432166400,,657,4.475
8386169,5,B0030VBGIQ,I love these movies!  You can watch it with or without the rifftrax.,1431043200,,68,4.230769230769231
8386170,5,B0030VBGIQ,"I just love badly made movies like this!!! John Carradine and George Zucco shine in their own unique, unintentionally hilarious way!!! Played it with the rifftracks once. It had a few amusing comments and was worth watching that way once. How majorly irritating it would be to watch that way again! So pleased to have it!!! I've viewed it quite a few times since I bought it.",1421971200,,375,4.611940298507463
