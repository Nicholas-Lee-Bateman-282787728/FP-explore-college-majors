8230004,5,B000XV55CE,I received the dvd in great condition and very quickly. Scott Sonnon's flows are smooth and balanced. The description portions include a fairly lengthy description on each flow.,1442707200,,177,5.357142857142857
8230005,2,B000XV55CE,"First of all, I am in awe of Sonnon's gracefulness. The way he moves is intriguing which is why I started exploring his systems. Adjectives and nouns like creative, liquid, fluid, water, gracefulness define Prasara. It is the MOST creative and the MOST fluid yoga you will come across. I challenge you to find me one better lol. You will certainly enjoy watching this. It is MESMERIZING! Doing it, however, is another story.....

This video has no follow along segment. In true Sonnon yoga teaching style, he spends all his time explaining every little move which is great but it becomes more of a lecture with no possibility of squeezing out a follow along as you listen. This may have worked with Flowfit but Flowfit only has 7 movements of varying sophistication that accommodate the very beginning couch potato all the way to the advanced exerciser. The moves of Flowfit are apparently from Prasara so after getting a taste, I wanted the Prasara buffet but sadly, Sonnon's yoga teaching format of ""lecture- performance- no follow along"" fails miserably with Prasara and here's why:

1) Contrary to what the dvd claims, this is NOT accessible to beginners. Unless you are a gymnast, an acrobat or a contortionist with some acrobatic background for strength, you will need a level 2-3 of Flowfit experience or some other yoga experience to even ATTEMPT some of the movement in this dvd Prasara. All 5 flows are advanced. They target different body parts for different reasons but they ARE advanced. Do NOT attempt them without some prior experience mentioned above. It will become dangerous very quickly.

  >>Flock of Pigeons focuses on opening the hips and strengthening the knee and ankles,
  >>Diving Dolphin releases the hams and lumbar and opens the shoulder and neck,
  >>Spider Monkey strengthens the upper body,
  >>Forest strengthens the lower body and
  >>Tumbleweed strengthens and relaxes the neck and also works as a hip flexor and psoas  synergizer.

You will need ridiculously strong knees to do Flock of Pigeons and even Forrest. If you feel your knees are strong perhaps those are the flows to start with. Your knees and neck should be in good condition to attempt Diving Dolphin. If you are a beginner, do not even try Spider Monkey unless you are asking for trouble. That should be the last flow you master in the series and even then, very gradually. Tumbleweed is the best flow to start with for beginners or those who have issues with any part of their body like knees or lower back. It is the most accessible flow of the 5 but you must go gently following my suggestion of creating miniflows in 2) below.

2) It has A LOT of movements in it (the opposite of Flowfit). There is no fun in pausing or rewinding every 2 seconds to watch, memorize and then execute. I would not even advise you to memorize multiple movements to practise later. This can be very dangerous if you are not careful. To be safe, you have to painstakingly pause, rewind and practise every single angle of a movement and do this for all the movements in a flow. This will take forever for someone new to Prasara. The best way is to pick 2-3 moves and master all facets of them and create mini flows to practise throughout the day as you learn new moves in the flow to add to your miniflow routine once mastered. Divide, create and conquer. This is the only way to ease this dvd's frustrating teaching format. This way you actually feel like you are getting a practise out of it and this will keep you going. Without using the miniflow strategy, you will quit Prasara before you know it.

3) The moves are complex and have you moving 360 degrees on the mat (something I LOVE by the way) but because you will find yourself facing away from the screen more often than not, reinforcement is necessary in the form of split screens, repetitions and follow along. None of these are present in the dvd.

The above reasons make a follow along section a necessity not an option. This video is dangerous and you MUST proceed with caution. A follow along with a modifier would have taken care of the risk factors that come with such complex and advanced transitory movements. This is not your regular pose by pose yoga. This one focuses on transitional movements and you have to be very careful with it. The inclusion a follow along segment would have made this a 5 star dvd easily.

Please note that you will greatly benefit from interlocking puzzle mats or other larger mats used in MMA. The 360 degree movements will be VERY annoying on regular slim yoga mats. Of course, you need the space for this. I would say a person of average height would need at least 5 by 6 feet of room. And yes, this goes for Flowfit, Bodyflow and TacGym. His other Tacfit programs like Tacfit Commando and Tacfit Warrior don't have this special space requirements and use regular slim mats just fine but the TACFIT programs are not yoga but really cool and creative 360 degree fitness workouts. They are a wonderful addition though. Perhaps a great place to start would be with Flowfit for something yogic and supplement it with your choice of the Tacfit programs and maybe explore Prasara later on when your body has gotten used to his movement system which you will absolutely LOVE by the way!",1340841600,13,5262,4.669189189189189
8230006,4,B000XV55CE,"This is a series of 2-4 min flowing yoga poses with a martial arts grappling style impression. The flow inspires the ability to increase mobility/flexibility, body awareness & fluidity.
Demos:
The flows are beautiful to watch & show gracefulness & inspire you to want to be able to achieve it as well. Each flow is shot beautifully outdoors w/beautiful Enigma style music & chanting in real time with slow body awareness of Scott Sonnon. There is Forest flow (4 min), Spider monkey, Flock of pigeons, Diving dolphin, Tumbleweed (each are 2 min).
Menu & presentation:
The menu is very simple with no introduction & contains only the choices of the demos or the instruction of each flow. Each flow is instructed in a bare room showing only a small corner Scott is in with which makes Scott's voice echo to annoying degree, but otherwise clear. There is no music & it feels like you're in a class especially as Scott speaks with detailed body position preciseness with no humor or passion. There is almost no camera angle change & Scott has to keep teaching the same thing over & over shifting his body so you can see it form different angles so you can better see to avoid injury. I wish he was in front of a mirror. Scott does a great job with details, showing the same pose or transition from one pose to another several times with more information about body placement each time.
Length of Instructions: Forest - 35 min, Spider monkey & Flock of pigeons - 15 min each, Diving dolphin - 23 min & Tumbleweed - 20 min.
Difficulty:
I started with the first, Forest & I thought I could do it as I've done beginner & some intermediate yoga on/off for several years. When he taught from going from a half lotus sitting to flow/stand into a tree w/only one foot, I tried, but I could not follow it even with all his detailed instruction & shifting of several angles. I tried slow-mo & also think my limited strength & endurance is an issue even though I have great flexibility. I gave up, looked at Spider monkey, but when he went from full star (advanced slide plank) to downward dog to wheel, I knew I didn't have the upper body strength. Diving dolphin had you do plow while twisting your legs/torso to different sides which I knew I couldn't do with my tight neck. Tumbleweed had him going from bridge to twist into plow & a simple kneeling shoulder stretch into plow, etc. Not to say the flows are all hard poses, there are child's pose, downward dogs, etc. but I am listing some of the more advance transitions that people might not be able to do.
My personal opinion:
I tried Flock of pigeons since it seemed to have the least demand of upper body strength & I can do a sloppy full pigeon which he does in it. After doing little over 10 min of the Forest pose, I was already a bit bored, intimidated & the constant body swivel changes to see the pose/transition at different angles, while helpful, only would confuse me more. Now I admit I am a slow but thorough learner, though with good passion/energy from the instructor, I can follow simply through intuition. I could not at all here as Scott's delivery was very matter-of-fact, though he does have great knowledge & body awareness.
Suggestions:
Though Cameron Shayne's Budukon's 3 yoga flowing workouts are also for only advanced practitioners like this workout (I don't have the strength to follow that either), I found that much easier to follow as well as the idea of hitting enter only when you need more detailed instruction. Cameron also seemed more relaxed & passionate about what he teaches. This is great for anyone who does have great strength & endurance & flexibility who wants more body awareness or grappling style body control which is great to have.

8230007,5,B000XV55CE,"The Prasara Yoga DVD is organized into five sequences, each one containing a demonstration and instructional track.  The sequences are performed by Sonnon in a peaceful outdoor setting with gentle but rhythmic electronic music in the background.  The music is enjoyable and complimentary to the practice.  There are no verbal instructions during the sequence.  A companion track features Sonnon breaking down various stages of the flow sequence.  His verbal and physical instructions are very clear, concise and easy to follow.  He uses enough repetition so that viewers can learn the movements.  Only select portions of the sequence are detailed with verbal instructions.  The instructional tracks might have been more helpful for beginners if Sonnon broke down the sequence from start to finish.  Nevertheless, viewers can follow the demonstration tracks quite easily since the key movements have been highlighted.  Take note that a basic knowledge of yoga postures is most likely required.

Practicing the sequences one immediately experiences the unique sensations that characterize the Prasara yoga technique.  A new type of fluidity between poses is experienced.  The yoga practice begins to expand, and to feel more like a continuous dance, rather than individual poses.  While some of the movements look a bit difficult, or as if they would require a lot of upper body strength, I was surprised at how easily I was able to slide into the sequence after watching the instructional tracks.  Perhaps most energizing was that I found myself adopting a new attitude towards my own daily practice after using the DVD.  While practicing familiar seated postures I found myself moving beyond the poses, expanding and stretching into new expressions of my favorite asanas.  I immediately credited the almost unconscious expansion of the poses to Sonnon's philosophy.  He writes, ""if asana were the alphabet and vinyasa the grammar, then prasara would be the conversation.""  It is an interesting and personal conversation indeed.  As a result of trying Prasara yoga I have felt my relationship to the poses swing wide open into new territory where I can move my body in new and intuitive ways to reach new ""edges"".  My individual daily practice feels more personal as a result of trying the Prasara yoga DVD.

8230008,3,B000XV55CE,"This DVD was released as a follow-up to instructor Scott Sonnon's original Prasara, Flow Without Thought DVD.  Because the original DVD offered challenging yoga flows without any instruction, Instructional Series ""A"" Flows was designed to bridge this gap.  Here Sonnon offers 5 different series, which including both traditional yoga postures and flowing transitional movements.  He breaks down each series in an approximately 15-minute step-by-step instructional segment, and the DVD also includes brief demonstrations of each flow.  The five series are as follows:

Flock of Pigeons: hip opening, knee, and ankle work
Diving Dolphin: hamstring work plus shoulder/neck opener
Spider Monkey: strength work for chest, shoulders, arms, and upper back
Forest: strength work for legs, glutes, and core
Tumbleweed: hip flexor and neck strengthening work

The main problem I have with this DVD is that the instructional portions, while very detailed, are still difficult to follow.  All of the flows involve frequent direction changes and take up A LOT of space, so it becomes very confusing to try to mimic Sonnon's instruction (the awkward camera angles don't help).  Furthermore, many of the moves themselves are quite challenging and thus only appropriate for someone who is advanced in yoga or extremely athletic.  A final note about this DVD is that the production values leave something to be desired:  the sound is echo-y, and Sonnon is filmed alone in the corner of a drab, empty studio.

Sonnon certain has a beautiful practice and is inspiring to watch, but I view this DVD as being appropriate for only a very small audience.",1211414400,8,1631,5.282945736434108
8230009,5,B000XV55CE,"This is a very good yoga system generally, and in particular for any type of grappler.  Although this is fairly advanced stuff, I think most grappler's ought to be able to perform most of the movements if they've trained more than 8 months or so. Very good for gaining strength, mobility, and flexibility that will protect your joints, and make you harder to submit.  You also sharpen you sense of movement, how your body is likely to react to a movement, and how to smoothly transition from a position that is potentially damaging. And it's very beautiful movement that is a joy to do, it's very meditative.  Scott's knowledge and instructional style is among the best I've ever seen in yoga or martial arts videos. He really breaks down the biomechanics of the movement and explains very clearly and precisely what to do and what not to do.  The knowledge in this video is priceless to anyone serious about yoga or grappling.  I also recommend his other video specifically for grapplers, ""The Grappler's Toolbox Reborn.""",1207872000,4,1022,4.817142857142857
8230010,4,B000XV55CE,"If you've never done Yoga before, this would probably not be the place to start.  Sonnon does a very good job breaking down the physical poses and movements and explaining them without a lot of confusing jargon.  But this is not basic Yoga by any means.  I think a beginner would get frustrated with Sonnon's beautiful but very challenging ""flows.""  They aren't extremes of flexibility or strength by any means, but to do them right, even with detailed instructions, you do have to really go inside yourself and patiently learn how your body works.  If you were to start with a program like this, I think the temptation would be very strong to make it a very physical exercise and lose track of the delicate body feedback and breath discipline that is central to the practice.  I suspect it would be easy to do a caricature of Prasara yoga that missed the beauty of it.

Sonnon builds wonderfully on the basic Yoga concepts to create something new and unique, constantly flowing but continually controlled movement patterns that take your body to its movement limits while letting your mind go into its own free flowing zone.  This is one of the most appealing forms of Yoga practice I've come across because it is very adaptable to athletic training, it works well to keep my body feeling supple and strong, and yet it still helps me to focus my mind powerfully once I begin to get the hang of the movements and the transitions.  I like this approach a lot better than trying to hold poses for long periods.  Sonnon emphasizes making the transitions smooth between asanas, without losing the important elements of each pose and coordination with breathing.  This makes Prasara seem to me a lot more palatable and quickly appreciable to people like me who come to Yoga initially from a physical and athletic rather than primarily spiritual direction.

The only problem I found with the instructional approach here is that while it breaks down the chains movement by movement very well, it does not offer much in the way of ""partial"" movements where the movements are difficult.  One of the compromises that Sonnon makes by emphasizing the transitions is that of course as a result he de-emphasizes the individual poses, and some of the poses are relatively advanced.  For example, there is a movement you sit, grasp a heel from behind you, bring the leg in front of you, and then fold it across you and stand up.  He explains the parts, but I found that I had to get very creative to find ways to ""train for"" each piece of the movement before I could put that one simple movement together.  It took a lot of flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination to do the simple movement that Scott demonstrates as a simple chain of movements.  I found that I had to take each piece and work on partial versions of it first before trying even the most basic form that he demonstrates.  I've noticed that a lot of beginner Yoga materials use all sorts of props and variations of poses to help learn and train for the more advanced ones.  Scott leaves that sort of remedial assistance as an exercise for the viewer.

That being the only thing I had a problem with, I have to highly recommend this Prasara instructional series for anyone who is either already comfortable with Yoga practice or willing to work diligently at it and perhaps add remedial work from other forms of Yoga.  Particularly for those who want a new exercise experience that blends particularly well with athletic and dance training, teaches you confidence in movement, balance, and body control, while keeping you supple, feeling great, and focusing your mind.  Yoga is a wonderful discipline for both restorative purposes and developmental purposes, and Prasara is one of the most ingenious and adaptable formats for practicing Yoga available in my opinion.  If you get tired of pumping iron and jogging and want something a little more sophisticated to engage your mind and spirit along with your body, this is a great option.",1203724800,7,3993,4.763425253991292
8230011,5,B000XV55CE,"Some complaints of the original Prasara, Flow Without Thought DVD was that it wasn't instructional in any manner. If you are not versed in Scott Sonnon's Circular Strength Training protocol, then there is some validity to the above statement. The original DVD, though beautiful in its production and location (and most definitely the Prasara flows)doesn't show the nuts and bolts instruction of the 5 different flows (though with careful review and knowledge of the body-flowing movements can be emulated).
Scott Sonnon's new DVD, Prasara, Instructional Series ""A"" Flows most definitely addresses the how-to instruction in a very detailed and understandable way. The five original flows (Tumbleweed, Flock of Pigeons, Spider Monkey, Diving Dolphin and Forrest)from the first DVD are shown (beautifully shot at  northwestern USA locations with soothing background music), each one followed by a detailed, step-by-step instruction of the individual flows, including the yoga asanas linked together by the biomechanical exercises Scott Sonnon introduced in his Body-Flow book and video. The all-essential breath mastery so intricate to yoga systems is emphasized with all the steps. These Prasara Flows which at first were intimidating to me now can be thoroughly enjoyed and performed gracefully and confidently. And like any good yoga, the physical and mental results are tangible.
I have many Yoga instructional DVDs (Shiva Rea, Rodney Yee, Seane Corn, Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, Cameron Shayne's Budokon and others) and this gem compares favorably with all of them for level of instruction, ease of
learning and professionalism of production.",1199404800,20,1644,5.602409638554217
