2774262,3,B000NOK0N0,"Alvin, Simon and Theodore set their sights on Hollywood with this trio of hilarious send-ups. First, Simon becomes the costumed crimefighter ""Batmunk"" and must foil the Jokester's (aka Alvin) evil plot to heist a large shipment of toys. Next, the boys boldly go where no chipmunk has gone before, in ""Star Wreck: The Absolutely Final Frontier."" Join Captain James T. Duck (Alvin), Mr. Speck (Simon), Moamz (Theodore), and the crew of the U.S.S. Booby Prize as they battle sinister aliens bent on galactic conformity. And, Dave and Miss Miller are accidentally shrunk after an unfortunate encounter with one of Simon's inventions, in ""Funny, We Shrunk the Adults."" Wish they would have included ""Daytona Jones"" and ""Robomunk"" instead of ""Funny, We Shrunk the Adults."" However, the episode selection didn't stop me from pre-ordering.",1178150400,10,831,5.303030303030303

2774316,5,B000NOK0N0,Fun for the adults as they compare the chipmunks to the actual movie while your grand kids enjoy the movie for its own silliness.,1331337600,,129,4.416666666666667
2774317,4,B000NOK0N0,"I liked the DVD, but would have really like it better if it was animated like ""Sequel"" and ""Chipwrecked"". I understand that Alvin and the Chipmunks- The Chipmunks go to the movies was made back in the day when there wasn't animation, but still in all it would have been alot better.",1330300800,,282,4.4423076923076925
2774318,4,B000NOK0N0,"As an ardent fan of the 1980s Chipmunks animated series and its various incarnations, I have to say that the episode ""Star Wreck"" is arguably the weakest of the episodes I have seen to date.  The plot meanders and the characterizations are not especially strong, especially those of the alien family traversing galaxy and destroying planets . . . they're just not that interesting. Alvin and Simon as Kirk and Spock are enjoyable, especially Alvin's affected speech imitation of a certain William Shatner.  Eleanor and Jeanette are given token roles in the episode and Britney (for once) does not appear at all.

Unfortunately, Paramount has decided to rerelease this episode to DVD in September (along with two additional episodes, ""Chip Tracy"" and ""Elementary, My Dear Simon"") in an attempt to capitalize on the publicity of this year's blockbuster Star Trek remake as well as the upcoming Chipmunks ""Squeakel"".

As glad as I am to see ""Elementary, My Dear Simon"" and ""Chip Tracy"" on DVD (Chip Tracy has never been available on home video before), I do wish Paramount would release the show in season sets, or (failing that) release episodes which have not been available on DVD before.  The reissue of ""Star Wreck"" is nothing to anticipate when fans are anxiously awaiting episodes like ""Gremlionis"", ""Irrational Buffoon's European Vacation"", ""Kong"" and the much sought-after ""Sploosh"".

If Paramount wanted to stick with the science fiction theme, they should have released ""S.T. The Space Traveler"" which has not been released to DVD yet.  This would complete the final season of the show on DVD -- what say, Bagdasarian Productions?",1245974400,3,1638,5.112359550561798
2774319,3,B000NOK0N0,"Ok, First of all, Im a fan of Bagdasarian productions.
Anyway after buying this unit from Amazon and opening it, ( everything seems to be all right )
but once I started it, something was wrong
the first episode of the DVD special ( aka Star Wreck )
kept freezing and doing weird sound skipping in 5.1 channel mode using the latest powerDVD ( this doesnt happens with any other tittles! )
the main annoying thing is, even when set in 2 channel audio ( seems the sound  track had damaged parts ) the speaking voices kept cutting off at random times. the rare thing is, the music and all other effects sound PERFECTLY FINE.

after trying the other videos of the same DVD; noone came with this error. so Im kinda baffled only one picture was affected, note that the DVD is physically perfec  (no damage)
unfortunately Im in another country so returning this dvd is kinda out of question due of heavy shipping prices.",1217721600,2,912,4.481927710843373
2774320,5,B000NOK0N0,"This Alvin DVD is exalant!
 Alvin and the chipmunks star in remakes of classic movies, and do a fine job! I like how the chipmunks always play the roles that fit thair natrual charitors (simon plays smart roles, Alvin plays naghty roles, theodor plays helpful roles) it is veryfunny and loads of fun, my current favorite Alvin DVD.",1217462400,,331,4.706896551724138
2774321,3,B000NOK0N0,"There is word that Paramount will stop selling this title 2 weeks after their new DVD will be released. The other 2 cartoons that accompany ""Funny We Shrunk The Adult's""  will no longer be available to DVD as ""We Shrunk the adults will be released again in the new release April 1st. I thought that Paramount was doing fine with there releases except for the valentine one with some music and voice replacements in one of the bonus cartoons.

This set is fine and the transfer is great. The only trouble I have with Paramount is that they are disorginized as to how to release the Chipmunks cartoons and movies. maybe they need to stop and really think about how to release their products rather then rush relese one verson of something then come out with another version of the same movie or product.. It sure would save a lot of fans a lot of fustraition and money in the long run...

Peramount needs to get their act together and release these shows as they should be released...",1205366400,5,982,4.50561797752809
