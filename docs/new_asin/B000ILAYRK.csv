8146039,5,B000ILAYRK,"This is the story of Roger Tory Peterson and his lifelong career of painting and writing books about birds.  The program was shown on PBS' Nature during the 1990's, although it is offered separately here. It is the biography of a remarkable man and his influence on and appreciation of the avian world.  Peterson appears in person throughout the video and provides us his own perspective of nature's most beautiful creatures. One can love birds and be drawn into watching them simply by watching this program.  It's a video well worth owning, and I wish it was available on DVD.",1227916800,,578,4.76
