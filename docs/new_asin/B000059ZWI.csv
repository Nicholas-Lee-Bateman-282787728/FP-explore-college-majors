7934473,4,B000059ZWI,"When an intelligent script, terrific acting, and talented directing come together, the result is a picture like 1991's DIARY OF A HIT MAN. Directed by Roy London, this film is a psychological study of a professional hit man hired to kill a young woman and her ""crack baby."" Forest Whitaker plays the assassin who wrestles with the meaning of his existence and his own humanity. Sherilyn Fenn plays the young lady. Both give virtuoso performances. Fenn, known widely for her work on TWIN PEAKS, is clearly underrated as an actress and after watching her interpret the part of ""Jain,"" you will agree. Sharon Stone and Jim Belushi have small roles but are also outstanding. Mesmerizing from start to finish, DIARY OF A HIT MAN deserves to be considered one of the best films of the decade.",1012953600,4,786,4.786764705882353
