2554670,4,B000F8J15W,"Saw this as a kid growing up and it's one of the few lesser known films that stuck with me. like ""Tai Chi Master"" aka ""Born Invincable"" I have had multiple copies of this on VHS only to lose them or lend them out and neevr get them back. I loved this flick back in the day and still do. Awesome fight scene in the Wine house between Sam Seed and Rubber Legs. And the Drunken mantis style is just sick! If you're a classic Shaw Bros lover, get this film!",1327968000,,453,3.989010989010989
2554671,5,B000F8J15W,"This is the one to get. I love this movie. I like many old school kung fu, but this one stands apart..in my opinion. Get this one.",1228435200,,130,3.8518518518518516
2554672,2,B000F8J15W,"Simon Yuen returns as Sam Seed, aka the Beggar So (or Su) in this sequel to ""Drunken Master"", the movie that made stars of him and Jackie Chan (aka Yuen Lung Chan).  The story begins with Rubber Legs (Hwang Jang Lee, who played the villain Thunder Leg in the first film) and his student (Cory Yuen) setting out to kill the legendary Sam so that RL can become the undisputed master of Drunken Boxing.  Sam, meanwhile, returns home from a several-year bender to find that his wife (Linda Lin) has adopted a son, Foggy (Yuen Shun Yi).  Much to Sam's chagrin, his wife demands that he teach Foggy his kung fu and look after him.  Sam tortures and humiliates the young man until he finally runs away.  Rubber Legs soon finds Sam and nearly kills him until Foggy intervenes.  With Sam injured, Foggy is on his way to the apothecary when he discovers a pale man in a coffin (Yam Sai Kun) who is an expert at ""Sickness"" kung fu.  The man then convinces Foggy that his style can defeat Rubber Legs.  Care to guess how it ends?

It should be noted that I am not a fan of the original ""Drunken Master"".  While this is nowhere near a great movie, it is a definite improvement over the first film.  The first fight in this one has Cory Yuen taking on Brandy Yuen in a case of mistaken identity.  Great fight, and sadly, the best one in the whole film.  The movie plays more on the creativity of the fights rather than their execution.  Meaning style is far more emphasized than speed, and it suffers.  The fights don't suck, they just aren't that great.

The humor is a lot better in this too.  I sat stone-faced through the original, yet found myself giggling a couple of times in this.  The only scene that I really had to choke down was the cameo by Dean Shek, the man who nearly ruined an otherwise flawless finale in ""Warriors Two"".

This DVD is distributed by Red Sun and the picture is remastered and fantastic.  Widescreen too.  English subtitles accompany the English dub, but are out of the way and likely won't bother anyone.  What might bother some is the fact that there is no chapter selection!  This is another title that I had to debate my rating of.  I am a skeptic of kung fu comedy, and there have been quite a few that have won me over.  This isn't quite one of them.  Almost, but not quite.  If you are a fan of ""Drunken Master"" (and apparently I'm the only one in the universe who isn't), you'll likely enjoy it.  I'm sure I'll take some crap from fu fans, but this is just my opinion.  It's just that when it was over, my level of kung fu satisfaction was on the low scale, and I didn't really have that high of expectations to begin with.  Again it doesn't suck, but I can't really recommend it either.  2.5 of 5

2554673,4,B000F8J15W,"A little slow at first, with the comedy. But old man is quick, if your paying attention. Seriously, surprising. By the end I was contemplating practicing my drunken boxing. Of course, if i ever became a Kung  Fu master, drunken style would be my choice. Not because I drinkie, I just have really crappy balance. Movie was ok. couple of bad ass moves. Not as much flare as other movies, and definitely overtones of humor accentuating the drunk style. So, if your a drunken style fan, have to recommend you watch for fun.",1455408000,,519,4.580645161290323

2554677,5,B000F8J15W,"This is a Great movie, directed by YUEN WOO PING . Also as a bad guy, HWANG JING MING fits the role to a TEE. If it only had JACKIE CHAN in the lead role, this movie would have been that much better! I recommend this movie.",1453593600,,223,3.765957446808511

2554679,4,B000F8J15W,"I want to start off by saying that even though Jackie Chan isn't in this movie, its still a great sequel to the Drunken Master. This one again stars Hwang Jang Lee as rubber legs and his student wanting to kill Sam Seed(Simon Yuen) so that he can become the northern drunken mantis boxing supreme. Sam Seed finds out his wife has adopted a son named Foggy who fills in for Jackie Chan. Later in the movie, Foggy meets one of Sam Seed's bothers in kung fu and he teaches him sickness boxing. The fight scenes are excellent in this film but i expected no less from  director Yuen Woo Ping. While not perfect, this remastered version is a vast improvment over that ground zero trash i bought 13 years ago.  The pictuer on that old version was so bright that is was hard to see certain things in the movie and hard to read the subtitles. This one i just bought was put out by golden dragon video and the pictuer quality is great for most of the movie except for the last 2 minutes you start to see some green blocthes but nothing too bad. I'm glad i bought it. The extras are english dubbed or original chinese language. English or mandarin subtitles. But the interviews with Ng see Yuen and Yuen Woo Ping are a waste.",1396483200,,1214,4.296943231441048

2554681,4,B000F8J15W,The choreography is great the fight scenes awesome and the sick style of lungful was cool. The leading man though is forgettable and a little annoying I watch it for the Kung fu and the old drunken master,1354492800,,204,4.394736842105263
2554682,4,B000F8J15W,"This review refers to the ""worldwide"" all region version (blue background, green title font, band at the top says digitally restored and remastered).  This is the best version of this movie i have seen so far in terms of video quality.  The film is presented in widescreen 16x9 and is pretty clean with solid colors.  However the disc has a faulty menu.  When you put in the disc it starts with an interview with the actor who plays Foggy. It lasts for about 15 or so minutes until you get to the menu screen. If you highlight ""play movie"" and select it, nothing happens.  If you select the next button(I forget which it is, I think it says ""special features""), nothing happens.  When you select the button that says ""interviews"" the movie plays.  Annoying to say the least, but at least it plays.
There are subtitle and audio options on the disc, but you cannot get to the options thru the menu. you have to select them from the buttons on your remote. The English dub is of much better quality, but of course the Chinese language soundtrack makes for a better experience with better, slightly more sophisticated dialogue.  I think i should also mention that the disc would not play from the menu on my PlayStation 3. it just plays the interview at the beginning, goes to the menu then the buttons on the menu would not work. It only played on both of my stand alone Blu-ray players.
  The movie itself is funny, with a decent enough story.  I have read online about some complaining about the action, and although it is not as slick as some of today's movies, the action is well choreographed and very creative.  Rubber Legs style is cool and weird combining Mantis Fist with Drunken Boxing and the fight in the tea house with Beggar So is legendary. Please why can't funimation or dragon dynasty or someone give us a better presentation? I'll stick with this for now, but i hope one day that this movie gets the treatment deserving of the classic that it so clearly is.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-of-the-Drunk-Mantis-Worldwide/dp/B000F8J15W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance of the Drunk Mantis (Worldwide)</a>",1335398400,3,2160,4.920110192837465
8118917,4,B000F8J15W,One of the best old kung-fu I've seen in awhile great choreography good humor and it's dubbed in English all right definitely worth watch at least one time maybe I'll see it again some other time too,1471737600,,199,4.405405405405405

8118919,3,B000F8J15W,It was ok. But don't expect the same quality of movie as Jackie's Drunken Master.,1466294400,,81,4.466666666666667

8118921,3,B000F8J15W,"This is definitely a classic of the early 1980s.  It was one of those Saturday afternoon shows on the FOX channel that made me a bad axx in my neighborhood.  I was copying and doing the drunken style in the middle of the street of Harlem.  Kids were fighting me and the drunken style had to make me act like there was no pain from the hits I was getting from other kids until I got home to see all my bruises.  However, I was the talk of the neighborhood kids because of the drunken style.  Anyway, this movie doesn't have a whole lot of a story other then there is a Master of drunken style kung-fu, and he has a student who learns to fight off the bad guys who came into town causing trouble.  What impressed me more was the Master's wife was quite a fighter.  To see an old lady doing kick-boxing, that's impressive.  The movie tries to add a few comical pieces, but the main thing to watch in this movie are the acrobatic kung-fu moves.  English is dubbed into this movie, so there is no need to read subtitles.",1460246400,,1015,4.190721649484536

8118925,3,B000F8J15W,This film is not that bad the quality of the video is ok and the acting is halfway decent.
