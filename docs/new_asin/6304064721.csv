7862426,4,6304064721,"Was a good ""Flashdance"" ripoff,but
with great soundtrack(better than Flashdance)
and good young actors(Olivia D'abo not great
in other movies,but in this movie she make a good
performance),and great scenes(especially
the pseudo video-clip with Desire song).
Why unlucky?
Because this movie has no ""copyright""
and so a lot of bootlegs were released
,all dvd releases until now(August 2017)
were vhsrip with very bad quality,probably
made with a common pc with a common
software and a common vcr(without TBC!).
So this vhs is better atm..
we hope for a real dvd release soon

7862428,3,6304064721,"This could be called a ""Flashdance"" rip-off, but it has something very unique. Keanu Reeves in his first supporting role on film, and he makes the most of it (""Youngblood"" preceded it, but that  was a small part). This slender youth commands the screen and exudes  awesome charm and charisma. A future superstar ! This is a must for Keanu  fans.",960595200,5,345,4.622950819672131
7862429,4,6304064721,"This is a fun and entertaining movie for anyone who likes gymnastics. It features Keanu Reeves (pre-""Bill & Ted"") as Tommy, the wannabe boyfriend of aspiring highschool gymnastic champion Robin, played  by Olivia D'Abo. One of the more memorable scenes shows Robin & Leah  (Robin's arch-rival) at the drive-in having a tumbling challenge to see  who's the ""best""--Robin ""wins"" with a  running-roundoff-backhandspring-backflip over a red sportscar. The movie is  also completely ""80's""--with big hair, pop music and funky  clothes. While the technical aspects of the movie leave a bit to be  desired, and the plot line is a bit predictable, it does have the requisite  happy ending.",949968000,4,681,5.299065420560748
