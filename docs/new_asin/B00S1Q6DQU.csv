6945203,5,B00S1Q6DQU,"WOW! I watch ALOT of movies and this is the first one to compel me to write a review,this movie delivers on all fronts if your into cult movies, nudity, gore, amazing soundtrack, but beyond that you care for the lead actress who did a great job conveying her emotions without words. The ending was amazing. Watching the directors interview in the special features you could tell he put his heart and soul into this film.check it out,you won't be sorry.",1429660800,17,452,4.592592592592593

8696855,4,B00S1Q6DQU,"Wow, I have seen this movie once before a long time ago so I was excited to come back to it and it did not disappoint.
This is possibly one of the most disturbing, emotionally charged films I've ever seen.
For the most part it's very subtle.
It definitely takes its time and builds the dread and the mood.
It just builds and builds and builds.
If you have a hard time with slow burning movies, you most certainly will have a tough time with this one.
But if you are a moviegoer that looks for a good slow boiler, you will definitely be rewarded with this film.
Dsire Nosbusch plays the part of an emotionally obsessed teenage girl perfectly.
She hits every note.
And something that particularly stood out for me on this viewing was the fact that she looks like Taylor Swift.
Which made the whole experience even more terrifying when you see where it goes.
Hahahaha!
Expertly directed by German filmmaker Eckhart Schmidt, this movie literally had me inching closer and closer to the edge of my seat.
I've read other reviews that said its boring, and I can get that.
It's definitely not for everyone.
But I couldn't disagree more.
I love his movie and I'm happy that it finally got an HD blu ray release.
It looks fantastic.
I also love that it gives you options.
You can watch the original German cut with subtitles or you can have the choice to watch it with an English dub.
Not much in the way of special features beside text bios on the making of the film and individual actors.
However, it does include a 20 minute interview with the director, which was very interesting and very much appreciated.
If you love this movie, you are going to love this release.
If you haven't seen it and you want a slow burner that lingers on the uncomfortable tension, then I would give this one a shot.
Love it.
Great cover art too!",1523664000,,1818,4.429850746268657
8696856,3,B00S1Q6DQU,"I liked the idea this film was trying to push, but the film was a wee bit boring. The acting is very good, but the payoff is not worth it. Could have been better.",1501977600,,162,3.7941176470588234
8696857,5,B00S1Q6DQU,"I don't like necromantik, but this one is romantic in a crazy way. This girl is pretty and crazy. This is the uncensored version. I would defenetly recommend that one",1465171200,,166,4.566666666666666
8696858,5,B00S1Q6DQU,"A film must have three qualities for me to qualify it as a great film. First it must have a soundtrack the appropriately carries the film without being too forward. Next, a film must have the ability the convey true emotion without relying on a lot of dialogue to keep the viewer aware of engaged. Lastly, it must have a hidden, less obvious message that mimics the entire feel of a film.  The fan is one of the best films I have seen in many years, granted its not for the mainstream movie goer or even a cult horror ""FAN.""  It moves at a pace that is slowly romantic, but for a good reason. Most films that move at this pace rarely go anywhere and leave the viewer with a feeling of being left out of a directors cruel inside joke.  Not The Fan! I was a little nervous about the english over dub, but was presently surprised that most of the dialogue was a voice over. If you are a fan of minimal wave, sleeper suspense, or just on the hunt for a lesser known expressionist film....Watch The Fan!",1453680000,2,998,4.242105263157895
8696859,4,B00S1Q6DQU,"It's a solidly creepy movie about a guy who sounds and looks a lot like a German Ian Curtis and one of his fans. Thankfully, it's also really well shot. It also has a kind of interesting slow burn pace that feels glacial but becomes agonizingly tense as the movie goes on. The movie wants you to be the captain of the Titanic but you see the iceberg coming. Success is had. The acting isn't exactly the best but it adds another layer of creepiness to the proceedings. It's an example of making lemonade.

Definitely worth finding if you like movies like Gone Girl and other thrillers that aren't for the squeamish.",1452038400,,614,4.482142857142857
8696860,4,B00S1Q6DQU,"I really think this could of been an excellent movie...  I wanted this to be an excellent movie...  Perhaps if I had watched this when it came out it would have been an original movie and that would of pushed into the excellent category...
I didn't watch it until 2015 and I think I wanted something more out if the ending...  But maybe if I hadn't seen so many derivative films based on this...  Oh well...
It is still a really, really good movie...  I just wanted more.

Blu Ray is a very nice transfer...  no technical issues.",1449878400,,529,4.336734693877551
8696861,4,B00S1Q6DQU,"Finally a German film from the 80's that is note-worthy.  This 1982 production (also known under its alternative title ""Trance"") is a great addition to a collection of any foreign-film aficionado or cannibal movies fan.  The acting is theatrical, the sets and music are colorful and very Euro-Electro pop 80's.  The film is about a young girl Simone, who has a profound crush (or is in love as she likes to think so) with an up-and-coming new German music artist by name of R, who specializes in electro-pop style of music (think Kraftwerk, Pet Shop Boys, and Depeche Mode).  She is so obsessed with the artist that she neglects everything from school work to her own personal life.  All that matters to her is to receive a letter from R in response to her multiple letter she has mailed to him...with no reply...she decides to go to Munich to see him live at a TV-show...what follows after is really bizarre to say the least...",1448150400,,928,4.634146341463414
8696862,1,B00S1Q6DQU,this one i got bored with and fast  all the good parts of this one came at or near the end of the movie,1445472000,,103,3.2916666666666665
8696863,3,B00S1Q6DQU,"I know this movie is listed as a horror film but I think it falls more under thriller. The basic plot is a young girl named Simone is obsessed with a pop singer named R. The first half is a slow build up as we start to see Simone's state of mind, what she thinks, how she acts. Everything is building up to something big, we can feel it while watching. She has this whole fantasy built up in her head. When she finally meets R things are going as she hoped, then something happens & the crap hits the fan in the second half of the film. There wasn't much blood actually considering what takes place I thought there would be a lot more then there was. The ending sort of has to be seen to be believed. Not a bad film at all & worth viewing at least once, if nothing else just to see the crazy ending. It can be a bit slow at times so if you want something that picks up quick this may not be for you, definitely a slow burn type film. This is also the first time the full uncut version of the film is available in the US as the old versions were edited for nudity at the end.",1445299200,,1074,3.9311926605504586
8696864,4,B00S1Q6DQU,"The first half of this movie almost feels as if it was directed by another person entirely. It's mostly a slow-build set up. But once the second half hits...oh boy is it good. Suddenly the atmosphere changes, a pulsating haunting new wave soundtrack kicks in, and characters become sadistic. Stick with it to the end and it'll get stuck in your head after the credits roll.",1438560000,,373,4.666666666666667
