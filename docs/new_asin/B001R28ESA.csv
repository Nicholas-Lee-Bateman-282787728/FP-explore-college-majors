This DVD is very detailed. From Theatre of Tragedy to Atrocity, the documentory follows each individual band members' careers.

Liv Kristine is interviewed along with her sister and parents.
Her mother and father are very proud of their daughter.

There are some outdoor interviews with stunning background scenery.
Also, the concert has an awesome set with a large screen mixed with a viking ship, oceans, and snow covered landscapes.

The male singer is Kristine's husband. While I enjoy her voice, her husband's growling becomes too apparent on some songs.

This is a five star DVD.

Extra: For music fans who prefer clean vocals, the male singer uses cookie monster growls; however, he is merely in the background.",1243468800,5,763,5.221311475409836
