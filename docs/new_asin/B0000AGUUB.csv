7997060,5,B0000AGUUB,"""I received the DVD this weekend and practiced to it yesterday. I really enjoyed it. The setting is beautiful, and your instructions are clear and encouraging. I appreciated the fact that it wasn't like a lot of the the other DVDs with one chaturanga after another. Warmups, generous sivasana and meditation were all great, too.""",1318464000,,329,5.0
7997061,5,B0000AGUUB,"This is a great video with a ""real"" looking model. Her cueing is excellent. I use Baron's DVD's often and like to use Sherri's as a slightly different routine.",1225324800,3,159,4.517241379310345
7997062,5,B0000AGUUB,"Thank you sooo much Sherri for creating this DVD.  You have inspired me to have a new and passionate refocus on Yoga Practice and I so enjoy sharing it with my students.

The views in the outdoor background are amazing. in the very beginning of the practice, extensions of the arms are inspiring as Sherri has reach upwards towards the sky. The beautiful scenery , with rhythmic music has helped me feel more open, and able to reach beyond my limits.

The sequencing in the session has a strong emphasis on the breath, and the workout is progressive in the way it flows.  You get to warm up first, then the challenge comes in. We are instucted to move through many postures, finishing with a restorative end, and meditation. Sherri's voice and way she speaks is also very important on this DVD.  Sherri has a calming and encouraging quality in her voice as she skillfully guides us through the standing, and more dynamic warriors, triangles and down dogs.

It's got intermediate to advanced challenge in many of the poses, with modifications suggested. The way it flows gives you pause and rest with some of the easier poses thrown in when you need them. Towards the end you do backbends that open your chest. By the end it's a feeling of being inspired, and that you've had a really good work for my mind and my body, it's nurturing too and gets you to breath deeper.

You can use the entire workout or just go to one section, like the standing poses, or right to the ending guided meditation. It's well thought out and I like having the choice to just do one piece of it or all. I find this DVD to be totally unique, and it has taken my practice to deeper levels.

Although I have spent one class with Sherri at a recent conference and then purchased this DVD, I have had such a wonderful response and I exclaim how she has inspired me so.  Thank You!

7997063,1,B0000AGUUB,"I read the reviews and bought this DVD because of the 5 STAR!!! rating it had at the time and was BEYOND disappointed--especially since she is a Baptiste.  I work hard for my money and this was a waste of time so I am writing this so that someone else will be informed of what I received and some much better purchases they have available.  This is nothing like a Baron Baptiste DVD, and worse it is not for ""the beginner to advanced student.""  First of all, this instructor is both OVERWEIGHT and extremely BORING.

The level of the workout is for someone completely unfamiliar with yoga at all. I wish that I had read a truthful review prior to buying this.

Here are some far better DVD's and tapes:

Yoga Shakti by Sheva Rea--

It may be the best Yoga DVD ever been produced for all levels. It provides a yoga matrix for you to structure your own workout, or use four pre-made sessions that are beautifully shot.  It is glorious.

For beginners--- Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Patricia Walden, and Suzanne Deason all produce high-quality, beautiful instruction and they are top-notch yogis and teachers.  Yoga Zone produces 20 minute sessions for beginners that usually provide 2 per tape/DVD.  If you want something outside of the American tradition, Wai Lana may be interesting for some people's taste.  She does not use vinyasas, and she does have series of varying difficulty.

Intermediate:  DVD's about 45 minutes long-- or a bit higher-- that improve strength, balance and flexibility really quickly include Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga Series, Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Series and he has two recent additons called ""Intensive Body Sculpting"" and ""Power Yoga for Weight Loss.""  ""American Power Yoga"" is actually a good 45 minute work out or if you are the type of person who would be amused by a teacher with a surfer vibe and total acceptance of where you are, ""Power Yoga For Happiness"" has the advantage of dividing the sessions into  two DVD's with 6 sessions (all cut up from one session) that are 32 to 80 minutes long.  Rainbeau Mars has some intermediate workouts as well. David Swenson is also excellent in the Ashtanga tradition.",1114041600,16,2145,4.769647696476965
7997064,5,B0000AGUUB,'I bought your yoga video and I love it!! Your workout left me feeling energized and refreshed afterwards and yet there are infinite possibilities for growth with the workout. It is a well balanced workout'  ~ Julie  from California,1059868800,3,232,4.923076923076923
7997065,5,B0000AGUUB,"I LOVE THIS VIDEO!  I am new to the Yoga world, this video was very accessible and rewarding.  Practicing this video gives me a true workout and makes me feel amazing afterwards.  I Recommend this Video.",1059696000,3,203,4.583333333333333
7997066,5,B0000AGUUB,"Sherri Baptiste Freeman has produced a wonderful intermediate Yoga Video that is very complete, inspiring and unique. I have over 90 yoga videos and there are many poses included here that I've never seen anywhere else. Even poses that are familiar to most practitioners are approached in a fresh way.

 Another feature of this video is that along with the use of vinyasa throughout, almost all of the poses are performed dynamically first (with preparatory movements) before holding the poses for several breaths.

 Though this is a very challenging yoga practice, all of the poses are possible for just about anyone who is in good basic health (and you can always modify to suit your needs). There are no poses  for example that require you to put your legs behind your head or any other movements that are out of the realm of possibility for most people.

 Sherri Baptiste Freeman was practically born doing yoga. Her parents Walt and Magana Baptiste were among the earliest Yoga and fitness pioneers in the United States. Her brother Baron Baptiste is also one of the leading yoga teachers in the world. Sherri brings a level of experience and depth that is rare to find anywhere. Her instructions are crystal clear and she demonstrates the poses beautifully.

 The tape starts with an interesting variety of breathing practices and shoulder openers that gently prepare your body for the challenging practice ahead. Among the many interesting approaches on this tape is the fact that, while it is a vinyasa flow, it doesn't have the traditional Sun Salutations. Yet you don't miss them here at all.

 Rather, early in the practice she has unique dynamically flowing poses such as Fire and Earth (Prithvi Mudra) which is a gentle breath led shoulder and neck opener, you then move into Victory Squats (Jyasana) which is a breath led dynamic squat which is done while opening the arms outwardly and inwardly.

 This dynamic and flowing approach to poses permeates this video which keeps heat in the body, helps to maintain focus on the breath and brings a meditative quality to the practice.

 After the warm up poses there are a series of hip openers such as dynamically moving lunges, revolved side angle poses, standing splits (a variation on dog pose with one leg extended) which moves into pigeon pose. These are soon followed by cobra and a Warrior lunge which flows into Prayer twist. Many forward folds and downward facing dog poses are interspersed throughout the tape as part of the connecting vinyasas.

 There is a complete flowing locust series which works this beneficial pose through different phases, first one arm and leg at a time and then both.

 Following are poses such as Tortoise (which I would describe as a pose that moves dynamically between plank w/ lowered knees and child's pose for several repetitions) , Bow Pose (dynamically performed), half plank (plank pose w/knees on the ground which moves dynamically w/ child's pose) which is followed by full plank that alternates dynamically with Down dog.

 Next comes a VERY challenging balancing series which has Warrior 3 pose (called balancing T-pose here), Skater's pose (another unique variation) and Butterfly pose.

At this point you move into a flowing Warrior series which brings you from  Warrior 1 to Warrior 2 to reverse Warrior(looking up) to Reverse Warrior (looking over lower shoulder). Then you move into a crescent lunge first with arms over head and then with your hands interlaced into the Yoga Mudra position behind your back.

 Boat pose comes next, (which is first performed dynamically) and which prepares you for the longer held boat pose. Purvottansana (reversed table pose with straight legs) is interspersed here between another held boat pose. This is followed by variations of dynamically moving core strengthening poses such as alternating knee to chest while bringing arms and torso forward, then w/ straight leg, then both legs bent, then both legs straight.

 Following are a lying spinal twist and Archer's Pose (another pose I've never seen before) which is done by holding one knee, with the other leg straight and raised, back is raised off the ground towards the bent leg.

 Then comes a back bending series which has bridge and wheel pose (aka upward bow) after which you release your back by bringing knees to chest and then reclining lunge (which is like dead bug or happy baby pose).

 The practice ends with savasana and seated meditation.

 If you are looking for a complete, deep, beautifully sequenced and flowing intermediate level yoga practice you will LOVE this tape!
