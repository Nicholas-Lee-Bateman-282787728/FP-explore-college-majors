8680735,4,B00NW88NBK,"This is the restored print, running 106 minutes, supervised by Charles Doble, of Powell's 1959 Technirama and Technicolor travelogue/ballet spectacular, photographed on location by Georges Prinal with assistance by uncredited Claude Renoir. The legendary prima ballerina Ludmilla Tchrina appeared in all four Powell dance films (as against Moira Shearer in two, plus PEEPING TOM), and this was her Powell swan song, primarily a showcase for the equally legendary flamenco specialist Antonio and his troupe. Tchrina, dancing with Antonio or swapping phonetic dialogue with Anthony Steel, is visually opulent in the regular Powell (sans Pressburger) way, and with the ravishing Prinal widescreen cinematography this is pure Iberian eye candy (cf. Don Siegel's 1957 SPANISH AFFAIR, released in Paramount VistaVision and starring Richard Kiley and Carmen Sevilla).

Steel notwithstanding, Powell has better stars with Tchrina and Antonio and a sumptuously rich soundtrack. Antonio dances a solo Zapateado to Sarasate, appears with Tchrina in Mikis Theodorakis' original ballet ""Lovers of Teruel"" and best of all there's a superbly staged 20-minute performance of Falla's AMOR BRUJO, danced by Antonio with Carmen Rojas, Rosita Segovia and an aged but agile Lonide Massine. The Falla music track was vividly recorded in Rome by Sir Thomas Beecham, a very rare instance of the baronet conducting modern Spanish repertoire. As a bonus Theodorakis composed a rather lovely theme song (of the sort Alfred Hitchcock always longed for) to cross-sell the picture: ""Honeymoon song"" is introduced here by Marino Marini, was subsequently a big instrumental hit for Geoff Love's MOR orchestra and was even covered by Paul McCartney and his cohorts.

That theme song is very fine, and the Falla ballet is genuinely exciting musically and visually, with all the fiery panache we associate with Beecham or Powell in the splashy RED SHOES/TALES OF HOFFMANN productions. The Falla alone makes this DVD well worth collecting, as the fourth (and least studio-bound) of Powell films that imaginatively elide any stylistic or class distinctions between the parallel art forms of cinema, ballet and opera. When other, more dour, directors--Bergman, Losey, Visconti, Zeffirelli--went to the opera or ballet, stage conventions usually intruded upon filmic artistry, while with Powell, working at Shepperton or on location in Spain, the performance conventions are adroitly blurred and elided, and the stylistic results hitting the screen flow even more naturally and winningly.",1472860800,2,2549,5.618181818181818
8680736,3,B00NW88NBK,"I'd give it 5 stars because I love the music in this film but the sound unfortunately  is not so good, could not stand the sound in 5.1 DD, it's too noisy and it's actually mono, so I had to set the player in mono where the sound is better but not great, what a pity!",1431216000,2,267,3.767857142857143
