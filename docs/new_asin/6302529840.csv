7827668,3,6302529840,"While the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-Eater/dp/B00005MM6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake Eater</a>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B00005MM6J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel </a>&nbsp;had set Lorenzo Lamas on the road of becoming an action hero, he was a bit more established by the time ""His Law"" rolled around, having starred in a good deal of other low-budget actioneers by then. I'm not sure why he returned to this series, but seeing as it's the only time outside of television wherein Lamas has played the same character three times, I figure he must have had a genuine fondness of the franchise. In turn, this didn't turn out to be a bad movie - better than the first sequel, but not as good as the original.

The story: hired by the wealthy family of a young woman abducted and brainwashed by bikers, the returning Soldier (Lamas) joins forces with a grizzled ally (stuntman extraordinaire Minor Mustain) to take on the hell-raisers.

Apparently, the plot is based on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0449131602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;written by Glenn Duncan - a first for Lamas. I can't say with what degree of faithfulness it was adapted, but taking its cue from a book hasn't toned down the enjoyably nutsy temperament of these movies. Humor and strange situations abound (e.g. the movie opens with Soldier thwarting a robbery by pretending to challenge the guy for looting rights), the characters are as detached from reality as ever and continue to say weird things (e.g. ""The only thing you're gonna do is die and like it!""), and Soldier continues to improvise a couple of nasty death traps, (SPOILER) the more entertaining of which is an electrifying toilet which he uses to kill a character played by late pro wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow. I'm not beyond complaining about some things, though: the death trap I mentioned is one of only two, and neither is as creative as those of the other films; and while few action movies will ever be considered in good taste, I really dislike how insensitively this one goes about depicting post-traumatic stress disorder.

One of my major complaints of the last film was how little action there was in it, and I'm pleased to say that the problem's been fixed. Lamas gets into two shootouts, four fistfights (using more actual karate this time than the other two flicks), blows up some stuff, and bulldozes into the bad guys' layer. Altogether, this one could stand to see more adrenaline scenes per minute, but what's there is good and occasionally creative, such as the motel shootout wherein Soldier and his partner literally break through walls to escape enemy fire. Speaking of which, the character played by Minor Mustain is pretty entertaining, and definitely the all-around best sidekick Soldier's had in these movies. The only other character who has lasting screentime is Soldier's girlfriend, played by Tracey Cook (""North by 60""), and sadly, she doesn't contribute much to the plot besides a sex scene. The main villain (played by Chip Chuipka,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emily-of-New-Moon/dp/B003EJO8TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emily of New Moon</a>) doesn't really get into the film until the last twenty minutes, but at least has a decent showdown with Soldier.

In short, I like the movie and rate it better than the first sequel, but it's not as good as the first ""Snake Eater."" Lamas action fans ought to investigate. I am still holding onto hope that Lorenzo will return to the series at one point and make the sequel that finally matches the original.",1366243200,2,3775,5.629173989455184

7827670,5,6302529840,"Yes, boys and girls, our old buddy Soldier is back, this time with a script BASED ON A BOOK (""Rafferty's Rules"" by Glenn Duncan)!  Whooo!  Well, believe it or not, that book was based on an old episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" (I am not making this up).  See, this hot, nubile young teenager (Tracy Cook) is abducted by a motorcycle gang and made into their sex-slave (that's the part from ""Unsolved.."").  But the parents aren't giving up.  They decide to hire the craziest cop this side of San Francisco: Soldier Kelly, to hunt down and kill the bikers and bring back the daughter.  Soldier takes the job and that's where Soldier runs smack-dab into BAM-BAM BIGELOW!  He of the tatooed head and short temper.  Remember when he kicked Ric Flair in the crotch at Wrestlemania 9?  I always say the presence of a pro-wrestler in the cast is a sign of a true character-driven movie.
  Anyway, Soldier tracks the guys down with his new sidekick (what happened to Speedboat?), the small, skinny and ineffective Cowboy (Minor Mustain).  Lots of gunfights, cowardly traps inspired no-doubt by late-night readings of ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine, and lots of NUDITY!  Yes!  Nudity is back and back in a big way in Snakeeater 3!  The hot daughter is naked most of the film, as is the even sexier exotic dancer, Holly (Holly Chester).  Oh, and even Soldier's girlfriend is naked!  I'm naked, too!  Bam-Bam Bigelow, however, is not naked, so that's good.  Regardless, this is actually a darn good, shoot 'em up kind of movie where most of the good guys make it out in the end.  Good, harmless fun. Except for the graphic violence.  And the bad language.  And the nudity.  Ah, go ahead and BUY IT ALREADY!!!!",1090022400,3,1695,4.690476190476191

I must say my favorite scene was when the mother of the girl was describing what had happened to her after being gone with and I quote "" a raging case of gonneria and genitle herpes"" I felt most sorry for the truckdriver who for his first time finding a nymphomanic will no have the gifts that keep on giving.",992390400,,441,4.25
7827672,4,6302529840,"After lamas is suspended for bad police behavior he decides to try the private eye business.  His mission is to find the biker gang who turned an  inoccent college student into a mindless slave. This film has very good  fight choreography for the apparent low budget. The beginning scene is  probably one of the most amusing starts to an action movie that I have ever  whitnessed.  Also a plus for this action packed ride is that wrestling  superstar Bam-Bam bigelow plays a big bad biker with a big bad attitude.  Lamas does a good job of making you believe that he is not scared of any  man, big or small. lots of Action, and a decent plot make this a film that  just about anybody will enjoy.",967939200,2,695,4.4015748031496065
