8554552,5,B00AN8EWF8,I haven't watched the whole DVD but the matches I've seen so far were pretty good. Extreme Rising is bringing back hardcore wrestling. Its putting on a better product than WWE.They don't make you the champion because you're the most popular. You're the champion because you are the best. I wish WWE booked their product like that.,1368835200,,330,4.807017543859649

8554554,5,B00AN8EWF8,"Do you miss the old days of ECW with the bad language, gritty stories, stiffer shots, and more risk taking? It's pretty much back, with a bit of a difference.

A lot of the ECW guys who are back for this great new Indy Fed can still completely hang, albeit a bit slower than they were in the nineties of course. =)

The new additions to the company like Bestia 666, Homicide, Blk Out, Matt Hardy, and a few others are excellent. They have all impressed me with their skills and of the two dvds I have seen (both this and 6/29/12 dvd) I was so surprised and happy about the quality of the matches and nostalgia factor.

The next shows revolve around some very cool matches happening, Raven VS Stevie Richards for the title, and Sabu VS Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger to name two of them.

I am grateful that Shane Douglas has started up this new incarnation/indy fed of Extreme Rising and look very forward to seeing them live someday. Excellent stuff, and worth a look for any old school ECW fans. =)",1363305600,,992,4.375
