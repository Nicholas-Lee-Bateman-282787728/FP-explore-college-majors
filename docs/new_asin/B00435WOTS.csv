8414193,5,B00435WOTS,"I got this DVD before my core fusion one..I can definitely see similarities.but I absolutely love my fluidity workouts..my butt never looked so good!! I had bariatric surgery, and wanted a real toning focused workout..my knees and back have issues, not to mention my balance is bad... this work out has helped me shed weight and inches exactly where I needed it. I have core fusion too.. but I personally love my fluidity more.. the equipment enables me to get my exercise in ways I never could before.... love it....",1410566400,2,517,4.7555555555555555
8414194,5,B00435WOTS,"This is a great workout.  It seems easy but the next day, you will know you have worked out your muscles",1386547200,,104,3.9523809523809526
8414195,4,B00435WOTS,"I believe that this is a good video for lower body work out, my main interest was my knees and thighs, it works well",1378771200,,116,3.875
8414196,4,B00435WOTS,"I wanted to lose some weight and shaping up my body better since doing traditional trade mill did not do much on the shaping up part. It took some time and muscle/bone pain to learn the whole thing, but you could see the toning result pretty quickly. And even though I still can't do everything perfectly after practicing for three months ( 3 times per week), I have lost 13 lbs gradually and I feel much stronger and healthier. Of course, you still need to eat healthy and control your caloric intake (otherwise your body fat burned by exercising is redeposited back through extra food calories). I also try to do other type of medium level exercise (ex. Hip-Pop Ab, trade mil)  for 30 minutes on days between Fluidity Fitness training, this way my bone/muscle pain is lessened and more variety keeps your exercise desire higher. And remember one thing, all weight loss training takes time, some pain, and great determination to shed pounds and keep the weight off.",1378425600,3,966,4.715976331360947
8414197,5,B00435WOTS,I love this workout!  It's a well-rounded exercise program that works deep into the muscles and works all the major muscle groups.  I especially like the stretches after each group of exercises as opposed to all the stretches at the end of the workout.  Three different levels of intensity are shown which is great because i'm at different levels depending on what group of muscles are being worked.,1358812800,6,399,4.838235294117647
8414198,5,B00435WOTS,"Since I injured my foot pounding on the treadmill for far too long, I needed to change it up a bit and when I saw this, it looked like something I could stick to.  And I was right.  I am still at the beginner's stage and I can tell that it is working my abs, butt, thighs, and arms.  I am 47 years old and muscles are really starting to get soft so the injured foot is a blessing in disguise because now I feel that I will be doing this probably more than walking even after my foot heals.  Also, science is now showing that this type of exercise is actually better for the aging brain than walking/cardio alone.  I will also incorporate other ballet exercises now that I have the very useful bar that Michelle created.  It is not the same as using a chair because in many of the exercises, a chair cannot possibly support you.  The beginner's exercise goes for about 45 minutes and it works all the major muscle groups and the time seems to go fast.  Also, the more I do them, the more I learn of the proper posture.  So stick with it, it is so worth it.",1335744000,17,1055,4.107317073170732
8414199,5,B00435WOTS,"I disagree with the other reviewer and these are just opinions... I am also an experienced excerciser who does barre workouts and I did like Michelle's instruction..she gets down to business and moves quickly from one excercise to another so that you get the job done quickly..
I definitely felt this one everywhere and I do love the barre.. I have the advanced dvd also so I'm selling the intermediate one but I will continue to work out with Michelle...",1331769600,7,455,4.7
8414200,2,B00435WOTS,"While the basic idea of this workout - doing a minimal number of intense, focused, isometric reps, one body part at a time to work the entire body - is a good one, the workout doesn't deliver. The music is blah and the instructor unengaging. The whole workout has a thrown-together feel to it and seems more like a commercial to sell the barre than a serious workout. I am an experienced exerciser and paid close attention to do the workout correctly but I can't imagine getting great results using it. For something similar and much more effective, I recommend Bar Method workouts.",1319587200,12,582,4.660194174757281
