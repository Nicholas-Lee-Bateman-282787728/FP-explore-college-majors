That's not to say it's perfect, though.

The most obvious (and IRRITATING) error prevalent in this is the fact that tsunamis - the correct scientific name for these large waves - are consistently referred to as ""tidal waves,"" which is wrong, wrong, WRONG!! - Because tsunamis have nothing to do with tides; they are formed by undersea earthquakes/volcanic eruptions, or landslides/asteroids into a body of water. That's another mistake this show makes - it only cites earthquakes as a cause of tsunamis. Also, probably because of an understandable lack of high-quality footage of real tsunamis, far too many shots of large breakers are used - this is misleading because many tsunamis don't resemble normal waves (as some of the real videos and films show).

It also tends to overdramatize (before the titles, tsunamis are dubbed ""the ultimate destroyer on our raging planet"" - the same is said of just about every other hazard covered in this series), and the tendency to use battered archival film just because it shows a tsunami (like, from Hilo, HI, ""one captured on film in 1954[actually, 1952] and another in 1957"" and a sequence from the Kuril Islands [they say 1963, it's actually 1952 - the same tsunami as the above-mentioned at Hilo]that serves no other purpose than just having a tsunami in it). (Furthermore, was it really necessary to colorize some of the older films and photos? It makes the scenes very difficult to discerne!)

However, the coverage of historical tsunamis (like the Hilo, HI tsunamis of 4/1/46 and 5/22/60) and the warning systems in the US and Japan, and the risk to places like the Pacific Northwest, and Los Angeles - what isn't a threat to them? - is good, as is research into these waves, and geological discoveries abut prehistoric tsunamis.

So, if you just remember that it's ""tsunami,"" not ""tidal wave,"" when you watch this, it makes a worthwhile coverage of the topic (without the melodramatic speculations the National Geographic special ""Killer Wave"" makes!).",1044835200,3,2118,4.938202247191011

The footage is spectacular and the facts are very educational. All  Raging Planets are simply incredible, and you should check them out, no  matter who you are.",934502400,2,307,4.5636363636363635
