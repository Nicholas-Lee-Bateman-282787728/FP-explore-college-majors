The movie starts with men walking along the shore. Peter Blood is treating a wounded man, a runaway slave. But Colonel Ramsey finds no one there. They hear that Cartagena was sacked and Captain Blood did it (identified by his blue and silver uniform). [Mistaken identification?] The English governor of Jamaica orders Blood's arrest. England is allied with Spain in their war against France. The Royal African Company has a monopoly on importing slaves and wants to keep their monopoly. Isabella recapitulates the past. [They reuse scenes from the earlier ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"" to keep costs down.] Peter Blood will be taken back to England for trial. Angus is sent to gather Blood's old crew for help.

Isabella visits the ship. A young boy dances and distracts the seamen, Blood's old crew captures the ship and its captain. Some of the ship's crew join the pirates. Blood accepts that he will be a pirate again. They sail for Tortuga to hunt the imposter. Soon they see a pirate ship approaching. [Note the black hull of this model.] Blood meets Mademoiselle Celeste on board. Captain Tomas tells where he got new doubloons. Where is Easterling? Isabella is charged with crimes, and admits it. The ship and the captain change their appearance before they arrive in Martinique. Captain Vandemeer visits a tavern, we hear a song. He returns later to see Amanda, but she won't talk. Easterling shows up with a friend. Later they quarrel. Will the Caf Duval buy French brandy? A ship needs a surgeon to treat a wound. A traitor tells the captain of the schedule of a treasure ship. The Blood escapes from this ship.

They try to set a trap for Captain Blood. A messenger tells the Governor about a threatened attack by pirates. Colonel Roscoe inspects the defenses and finds old guns. He orders new emplacements on the shore. They fire at the ship in the channel to sink it. The pirate ship attacks at night and cannonades the shore defenses. Blood explains who is the real pirate. Captain Evans reveals his true character. The attack is defeated! There is a sword fight in dim light, the good guy wins. The next morning there is a wedding. Did they lived happily ever after?

This is a sequel to the earlier movie ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"". This Technicolor movie is based on a novel by Rafael Sabatini. It is about as good as the earlier version, with more action and a story that seems implausible.",1344988800,,2435,4.749408983451537
