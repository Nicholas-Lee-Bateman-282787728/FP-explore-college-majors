You can very rarely even turn on a television show these days without experiencing vulgarity, crude humor and/or disgusting gore, much less rent a movie as such. My hat is off to the film maker, the writer, the cast (especially Randy Travis) and everyone else involved in the making and distribution of this movie for having the grit to make an interesting movie without the common distractions of lewd or unwarranted behavior, language or life styles.

3104991,3,B0013D8L9A,"As a compelling mixture of the biblical book of Job and the Sermon on the Mount, The Wager is a good story, with many surprising twists and relevant insights. The novel, written by Bill Myers, is a powerful tale of trials and triumphs. However, when the printed story moved to DVD, some of the intensity was lost in the media conversion. While still a riveting tale, it could have had more impact if the actors showed a greater emotional involvement in the volatile situations.

Michael Steel (Randy Travis) is about to make cinema history as the first Christian actor nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Yet, God has cast him in a different starring role. When Satan claims that no one can live the Sermon on the Mount in today's society, Michael gets the lead role in this supernatural drama. In the space of ten tension-filled days, his life gets bombarded from every possible angle. From his personal life to his marriage to his career, Michael has to hold on to his faith in the middle of a furious spiritual battle.

Fans of Randy Travis will enjoy seeing this singer in an acting role. Also of interest was the character, Cassandra, played by Candace Cameron Bure of ""Full House"" fame. Her role of seductress stayed within the boundaries of good taste and allowed viewers to understand the temptation without having it splashed across the screen. And that's where the movie shines. Tastefully produced and staying true to the theme of the novel, this film has the potential to present a life dedicated to the cause of the Christ regardless of the casualties the world may throw.

As a contemporary parable with a purpose, The Wager is a safe bet.

3104995,4,B0013D8L9A,"A Christian film starring Randy Travis (country western/gospel singer), Nancy Stafford (Matlock) and Candace Cameron Bure (Full House)

Michael Steel (Randy Travis) is a hot commodity in Hollywood. He's been nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award and is riding high. This nomination is a 'big deal' for Michael as he's experienced a great deal of prejudice for his faith as a Christian.

Michael's faith is tested in the days before the Academy Award presentation. His wife has filed for divorce because she feels neglected, the director of his current film demands he shoot a scene that is in opposition to his belief of right and wrong (and one that has been covered in his contract), the female star (Candace Cameron Bure) of the film makes untrue allegations involving her relationship with Michael, and a journalist with an axe to grind reports a story about Michael and a young child.

With his life falling apart, Michael seeks advice and refuge with his sister Annie (Nancy Stafford). Through her words and her actions she helps guide him through the valley of misery he's entered into.

While Michael faces the most important event of his life, he also must make a choice that will change his life forever. It's the fight of all fights with Satan.

The Wager is a 'message' film. It's a story about good vs. evil from the perspective of a follower of Christ. There are no easy answers to the questions asked, and while the story has a satisfactory ending, there is always the unasked question for the viewer: what would you do if?

The Wager isn't a film that is going to be popular in our secular society and that's too bad. It is, however, one that people who want something wholesome with a values message will find appealing.

It's wonderful to have films available for people who don't want what is usually served up in movie theaters.

Armchair Interviews says: Wager is one of those films.",1211328000,29,1907,4.757575757575758

Because of this, it may appeal to a wider non-Christian audience but may also disappoint some Christian viewers expecting a clear evangelical message. The story itself is quite ordinary. It's not bad but also not very inspired or interesting.

The story is emotional, powerful and engaging. It may have a Christian message but it is also a film about life in general and behaviour and peoples feelings - how to live a better life.

3105046,3,B0013D8L9A,"This movie is not for the unsaved. It was kind of hard to follow in parts for me. You see a Christian man going thru a lot of problems right in front of the public eye. You see him stand firm in his faith and convictions. You see those who are close to him push him to do what THEY perceive as 'best' for him-even if it goes against his moral code.
It was great seeing him stand firm. It is a clean movie-no sex and no cussing. That part is great!! I really don't think anyone under the age of 18 will enjoy it -it is kind of slow in parts of the movie. It did not keep my husband's attention at all -due to the fact of him being a newbie to faith and most new christians don't really want to think of christians having just as many problems as the person who isn't. Plus there just was not that much action in it and some parts were pretty slow--like when Travis was stuck in the house with all the camera's and newspeople outside--slow.

I'm not a big fan of Randy Travis' music, but thought he did a pretty good job as Michael Steel, the blockbuster movie star with the wholesome image whose world falls apart as the devil and God place a bet on his soul.  You really feel sorry for him as the viewer, because you know he didn't do anything wrong, and just when you think all is lost, God turns everything around in the end, although he has been reaching out to Michael all along.  It doesn't hit you over the head with too much preachiness like The Encounter, so more secularly based people are likely to warm up to it too, and it still gets a very clear message across about doing the right thing.

And no it is not because Nancy Valen is in it, though that did prompt me to watch it.  What I really love about this movie is its message, that can be used whether you are Cristian or not. The message is a simple one really, stay true to your belief no matter what horrors you are seeing in your world.  If you truly believe in what ever faith you have, then you will find the strength to overcome or deal any obstacle that has found it way into your life. There are enough funny moments, (mostly thanks to Mr. Law,) in the film to keep you entertained while delivering its serious message.

There are some surprising faces, familiar from favorite TV shows of the past. Most of the acting is very good. The plot slows down just a little at times, but we forgive that because the story is so good. It felt to me a little like some of the characters were left unexplored -- like maybe the story needed to be longer in order to answer the questions posed in the first half of the movie. Overall, it's not a great movie, but it's definitely a good movie, and well worth watching, at least once.

3105085,2,B0013D8L9A,"I found the plot-line in this movie confusingly unrealistic.
We have a Christian man who is collaborating with a degenerate manager, working for some kind of Oscar trophy within a realm of the movie industry, which has its niche in illicit sex and violence.
These should be our first two clues that we are not in Kansas anymore!

Next we find that he is in the middle of reaping a harvest of years of this same kind of bad sowing.
For example:  He is a ""yes-man"" for his degenerate movie director who expects him to perform sexually on camera, and his wife is leaving him because he has continuously allowed his movie career to destroy their relationship.

Next he puts his hands on a scantily-dressed self-absorbed unbeliever actress and doesn't have a clue that his body language is automatically interpreted as sexual.

Now on top of all of that, we are supposed perceive him as a devout Christian who is trying to keep Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5?

I think I understand the fundamental reasoning of ""being IN the world and not OF it"".
However, the plot-line and especially the show-casing are just so cheesy, I'm concerned that the movie actually sends a message that is more detrimental than beneficial to the non-Christian audience.

Movies that we love include all of ""The Bible Collection"",  ""The Love Dare"", ""Facing the Giants"",  ""End of the Spear"" and ""Faith like Potatoes""?

We watched about 20 minutes of this one and gave up on it.",1262476800,6,1446,4.729083665338646

3105107,4,B0013D8L9A,"This movie stars Randy Travis as Micheal Steele, an actor who has been nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards. It begins with Michael hearing the Rev. John Hagee on the radio or TV. The Rev. Hagee proposes a ""wager"", can you maintain your faith, if you lose your career, your spose, and your reputation? Well Michael is really put to the test in this movie, because he loses all three.

First, he is currently working on the filming of a movie, and the director wants him to film a sex scene. Michael says that is not up for discussion. He said they had an agreement that he would not film any sex scenes. The director pressures him, but Michael continues to refuse, so the director fires him.

Next, his wife tells him she is leaving him, and has filed for a divorce. Michael is served the divorce papers.

The day Michael was fired from the movie business, he had taken an 8 year old boy along, who I think is the son of his sister. Anyway, he takes the boy on home with him. An actress who Michael has worked with drops by Michael's home. She tries to get him to do the movie scene. Michael gets mad, she leaves, Michael follows her out the door, and so does the little boy. The media is at his gate watching the event. They accuse Michael of not wanting the woman, and falsely accuses him of having an affair with the 8 year old boy. They falsely accuse him of being a pervert, and child molester. Thus, he loses his reputation.

Then Michael's mother dies.

However, Michael holds on to his faith. On the way to the Academy Awards, Micheal has the limo driver to stop. He says he knows he as to be at the location where the boy is, but he don't know why? His manager thinks he's crazy. Randy goes to the boy's home and finds a grown man beating the boy. Michael intervenes, and beats up the man, and makes sure the boy is okay. The cops are called, and Michael is vindicated from the child abuse accusations. He also won the Best Actor Award which his wife accepted for him. He gets his career back and his wife back and his reputation back. So, he won the ""wager"".

This is one of those movies that leaves you with a happy feeling. Randy is a great actor. This is a great movie about holding on to your faith under adverse conditions. Thanks and may God Bless.",1259452800,3,2274,4.276744186046511

It was more than disappointing, though, it was terrible. Sincerely I speak--it was terrible. And I'm sad to have to say that, because it had great potential.

The best thing I can say is that the film techniques were occasionally interesting. The acting was ok. The plot was choppy and disjointed to say the least. Worst of all, to me, this movie had the opportunity to share something important with its audience, and it completely and utterly failed to do so. The Wager is made between God and Satan for this one man. If you blink at the beginning of the movie, you miss it, and it is never referred to again. This man is supposed to learn to LIVE the Sermon on the Mount, and he does not do it. He hardly mentions it, and he doesn't do anything about it. ONCE, he goes into his co-star's trailer to tell her to calm down and give the jerk director one more chance. Voila!

Michael Steel (Randy Travis) is a hot commodity in Hollywood. He's been nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award and is riding high. This nomination is a 'big deal' for Michael as he's experienced a great deal of prejudice for his faith as a Christian.

Michael's faith is tested in the days before the Academy Award presentation. His wife has filed for divorce because she feels neglected, the director of his current film demands he shoot a scene that is in opposition to his belief of right and wrong (and one that has been covered in his contract), the female star (Candace Cameron Bure) of the film makes untrue allegations involving her relationship with Michael, and a journalist with an axe to grind reports a story about Michael and a young child.

With his life falling apart, Michael seeks advice and refuge with his sister Annie (Nancy Stafford). Through her words and her actions she helps guide him through the valley of misery he's entered into.

While Michael faces the most important event of his life, he also must make a choice that will change his life forever. It's the fight of all fights with Satan.

The Wager is a 'message' film. It's a story about good vs. evil from the perspective of a follower of Christ. There are no easy answers to the questions asked, and while the story has a satisfactory ending, there is always the unasked question for the viewer: what would you do if?

The Wager isn't a film that is going to be popular in our secular society and that's too bad. It is, however, one that people who want something wholesome with a values message will find appealing.

It's wonderful to have films available for people who don't want what is usually served up in movie theaters.

Armchair Interviews says: Wager is one of those films.",1211328000,29,1907,4.757575757575758
3339493,3,B0013D8L9A,"Randy Travis plays Michael Steele, an Oscar nominated movie star with some personal problems. He doesn't get along with the director of the movie he's working on, his wife has just handed him divorce papers, and soon, another scandal hits him, shattering his image.

Because of this, it may appeal to a wider non-Christian audience but may also disappoint some Christian viewers expecting a clear evangelical message. The story itself is quite ordinary. It's not bad but also not very inspired or interesting.

It would have made more sense if he were to be more emotional. HOWEVER, this is just the way this guy is.  He is not over the top in feely feely, rainbows and fluffy bunnies, tears, anger or what not.  I would have been if I were in his shoes though.  The person that plays his sister is top notch.

You see him stand firm in his faith and convictions. You see those who are close to him push him to do what THEY perceive as 'best' for him-even if it goes against his moral code.
It was great seeing him stand firm. It is a clean movie-no sex and no cussing. That part is great!! I really don't think anyone under the age of 18 will enjoy it -it is kind of slow in parts of the movie. It did not keep my husband's attention at all -due to the fact of him being a newbie to faith and most new christians don't really want to think of christians having just as many problems as the person who isn't. Plus there just was not that much action in it and some parts were pretty slow--like when Travis was stuck in the house with all the camera's and newspeople outside--slow.

I'm not a big fan of Randy Travis' music, but thought he did a pretty good job as Michael Steel, the blockbuster movie star with the wholesome image whose world falls apart as the devil and God place a bet on his soul.  You really feel sorry for him as the viewer, because you know he didn't do anything wrong, and just when you think all is lost, God turns everything around in the end, although he has been reaching out to Michael all along.  It doesn't hit you over the head with too much preachiness like The Encounter, so more secularly based people are likely to warm up to it too, and it still gets a very clear message across about doing the right thing.

And no it is not because Nancy Valen is in it, though that did prompt me to watch it.  What I really love about this movie is its message, that can be used whether you are Cristian or not. The message is a simple one really, stay true to your belief no matter what horrors you are seeing in your world.  If you truly believe in what ever faith you have, then you will find the strength to overcome or deal any obstacle that has found it way into your life. There are enough funny moments, (mostly thanks to Mr. Law,) in the film to keep you entertained while delivering its serious message.

There are some surprising faces, familiar from favorite TV shows of the past. Most of the acting is very good. The plot slows down just a little at times, but we forgive that because the story is so good. It felt to me a little like some of the characters were left unexplored -- like maybe the story needed to be longer in order to answer the questions posed in the first half of the movie. Overall, it's not a great movie, but it's definitely a good movie, and well worth watching, at least once.

3339582,2,B0013D8L9A,"I found the plot-line in this movie confusingly unrealistic.
We have a Christian man who is collaborating with a degenerate manager, working for some kind of Oscar trophy within a realm of the movie industry, which has its niche in illicit sex and violence.
These should be our first two clues that we are not in Kansas anymore!

Next we find that he is in the middle of reaping a harvest of years of this same kind of bad sowing.
For example:  He is a ""yes-man"" for his degenerate movie director who expects him to perform sexually on camera, and his wife is leaving him because he has continuously allowed his movie career to destroy their relationship.

Next he puts his hands on a scantily-dressed self-absorbed unbeliever actress and doesn't have a clue that his body language is automatically interpreted as sexual.

Now on top of all of that, we are supposed perceive him as a devout Christian who is trying to keep Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5?

I think I understand the fundamental reasoning of ""being IN the world and not OF it"".
However, the plot-line and especially the show-casing are just so cheesy, I'm concerned that the movie actually sends a message that is more detrimental than beneficial to the non-Christian audience.

Movies that we love include all of ""The Bible Collection"",  ""The Love Dare"", ""Facing the Giants"",  ""End of the Spear"" and ""Faith like Potatoes""?

3339604,4,B0013D8L9A,"This movie stars Randy Travis as Micheal Steele, an actor who has been nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards. It begins with Michael hearing the Rev. John Hagee on the radio or TV. The Rev. Hagee proposes a ""wager"", can you maintain your faith, if you lose your career, your spose, and your reputation? Well Michael is really put to the test in this movie, because he loses all three.

First, he is currently working on the filming of a movie, and the director wants him to film a sex scene. Michael says that is not up for discussion. He said they had an agreement that he would not film any sex scenes. The director pressures him, but Michael continues to refuse, so the director fires him.

Next, his wife tells him she is leaving him, and has filed for a divorce. Michael is served the divorce papers.

The day Michael was fired from the movie business, he had taken an 8 year old boy along, who I think is the son of his sister. Anyway, he takes the boy on home with him. An actress who Michael has worked with drops by Michael's home. She tries to get him to do the movie scene. Michael gets mad, she leaves, Michael follows her out the door, and so does the little boy. The media is at his gate watching the event. They accuse Michael of not wanting the woman, and falsely accuses him of having an affair with the 8 year old boy. They falsely accuse him of being a pervert, and child molester. Thus, he loses his reputation.

Then Michael's mother dies.

However, Michael holds on to his faith. On the way to the Academy Awards, Micheal has the limo driver to stop. He says he knows he as to be at the location where the boy is, but he don't know why? His manager thinks he's crazy. Randy goes to the boy's home and finds a grown man beating the boy. Michael intervenes, and beats up the man, and makes sure the boy is okay. The cops are called, and Michael is vindicated from the child abuse accusations. He also won the Best Actor Award which his wife accepted for him. He gets his career back and his wife back and his reputation back. So, he won the ""wager"".

It was more than disappointing, though, it was terrible. Sincerely I speak--it was terrible. And I'm sad to have to say that, because it had great potential.

The best thing I can say is that the film techniques were occasionally interesting. The acting was ok. The plot was choppy and disjointed to say the least. Worst of all, to me, this movie had the opportunity to share something important with its audience, and it completely and utterly failed to do so. The Wager is made between God and Satan for this one man. If you blink at the beginning of the movie, you miss it, and it is never referred to again. This man is supposed to learn to LIVE the Sermon on the Mount, and he does not do it. He hardly mentions it, and he doesn't do anything about it. ONCE, he goes into his co-star's trailer to tell her to calm down and give the jerk director one more chance. Voila!

His faith is tested, but once he loses his wife and his sister, he doesn't change. He actually throws himself into his career DEEPER. He does end up doing something supposedly heroic at the end, but only",1235865600,6,1309,4.423236514522822
