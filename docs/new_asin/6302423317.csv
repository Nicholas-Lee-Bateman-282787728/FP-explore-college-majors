7826092,3,6302423317,"""Ladies on the Rocks"" was an interesting film to watch, yet somewhat bewildering. Overall, I mostly enjoyed the production, which focuses more on the off-stage, everyday life (and challenges) of the leads (which is very chaotic--the ladies pay a price for prioritizing their artistry in their lives). When the traveling/stage show is presented, it's quite vulgar and very offbeat and, quite honestly, not nearly as engrossing as the drama the performers face in their day-to-day reality. To be honest, I'm not sure what paying customers would find of interest in the show the ladies present, but this may simply be a case of my not understanding the nature of live performances in Denmark of the early 1980s. Regardless, ""Ladies on the Rocks"" is worth a look for those of an open mind who enjoy quirky foreign films.",1437782400,,816,4.963503649635037
