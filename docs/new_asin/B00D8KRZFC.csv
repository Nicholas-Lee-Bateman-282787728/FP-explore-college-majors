8590608,4,B00D8KRZFC,"Excellent serial.  I saw this several times on an afternoon TV kid's show when I was 8-10 years old.  The Grapevine DVD-R is the best version I have seen of the serial, though far from perfect.  I wish Universal would get the lead out and release this serial along with many of their other great serials on an updated and re-digitalized DVD.  Until then, try this Grapevine version.  I think it is satisfactory.",1461888000,,411,4.575342465753424
