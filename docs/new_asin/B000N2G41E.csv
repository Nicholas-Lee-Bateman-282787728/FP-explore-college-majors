8174022,1,B000N2G41E,"'No One Cries Forever', except those who suffered through this melodramatic mess. This flick is abysmal on all fronts. The print utilized was from a VHS copy (roll bars appear at various points) and the picture is muddy and indistinct. The DVD cover (and Amazon as well, but they're just repeating the details) lists Marisa Mell as an actress and she's not even in the flick! She and Elke were my two main interests in this film, so now I'm really ticked. But wait, it gets worse.

 The story revolves around two women who work for a brothel, one young, one older (Elke), and the young one falls in love and wants out. But it's never as easy as that, is it? And so this premise drags on for another 75 minutes, leaving one feeling as though they had just undergone root canal without the benefit of anesthesia. I kept awaiting the appearance of Marisa Mell (who I've loved since her iconic image in 'Danger: Diabolik') or would have either shut it off or ended my misery in a more untactful way. You'd think that a story centering on a brothel would have its merits, but you'd be proven wrong, as there isn't one good looking woman or ounce of nudity involved anywhere. My internal cries of ""Kill me now"" went unheard, so I persevered and miraculously survived this nightmare, but pray my admonitions will steer you away from this cinematic bile. Awful in the extreme, avoid at all costs.",1317945600,4,1388,4.548
