8398259,4,B003JMGKJG,"John Nelson has given us what I consider the ultimate Bach B Minor mass on DVD (see my review), and I approached this issue with high expectations. The competition is admittedly stiff: there is Bernstein's inimitable recording, still relatively fresh in sound and video, Gielen's unique version (nla), the very good Gilbert Levine and, most recently, Thielemann's grandiose reading (see my review). Nelson takes a different approach to what could arguably be called Beethoven's greatest work. His orchestral forces, the brilliant COE, are relatively lean and they play modern instruments, with the exception of period trumpets and timpani. His choir, however, the wonderful Gulbenkian Choir, is quite large. As he takes some passages at breakneck speeds (listen to the final bars of the Gloria and the Credo respectively) he can easily achieve with his orchestra, the choir members and the very good soloists are occasionally kept on their respective toes and almost pushed to their limits. All in all, and this may sound contradictory, his approach to the sore is both highly dramatic and equally devotional. There is plenty of drama to portray Beethoven's at times grim struggle with the divine, but the intimate moments shine with a calm luminescence. The bonus interview shows Nelson as a thoughtful, highly articulate musician who has found a personal relationship with ""his"" Missa. The 2010 Lisbon recording has a traditional, near-perfect video. My only quibble is with the audio balance which at times favors the human over the instrumental voices. The latter may be slightly overwhelmed by either the choir and/or the soloists - who are intentionally placed in front of the choir but nevertheless miked very close. This minor technical flaw is the only reason for my four stars. Artistically, the performance is second to none. If you are happy with either Gilbert or Thielemann, you probably won't need it. If, on the other hand, you love the Missa as much as I do and find that it can be interpreted in many ways, go for it.",1320192000,14,2035,5.077611940298508

  Recording technicians have had trouble with Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, because of the wide-ranging dynamics inherent in the piece.  Unlike the last symphony, which starts softly, the contemporaneously composed Missa Solemnis starts out (after a brief orchestral prelude) with very loud choral singing--over which the soloists have to introduce themselves and make themselves heard.  That is only the challenge of the first few bars of music.  The challenge continues through the next eighty minutes.  Here all four soloists sing beautifully and and do not strain, even though this appears to be a live performance with applause and ""bravos"" at the end, and there is no distortion or congestion of the massed choral forces, who consistently maintain an accurate pitch.  Many hours of rehearsal no doubt went into this performance, and the hand of a strong director is clearly at work.
  Enoch von Guttenberg has been proving himself one of the world's finest directors of choral classics for the past twenty years.  In the 1990's he recorded the two big Bach Passions and the Christmas Oratorio in performances that were released on Laserdisc.  In 1997 he recorded the Bach Mass in a very fine way, released on DVD.  Several years ago he again recorded the Matthew Passion, which appeared on DVD-Audio.  Now his rendition of the Missa Solemnis appears on Blu-ray (from the same studio that released the previous DVDA).  Every one of these releases approaches the rank of definitive performance, though clearly most of the results have been stuffed into technological dead ends from which it is difficult to retrieve them at this time.  Hopefully the Blu-ray universe will live long and provide a suitable environment for this wonderful performance and others to come.
  My new OPPO BDP83SE loves this disc and sends incredible sounds through my speaker system.  What can I say?  This must be the way Beethoven imagined this work should sound.  Of course, he never heard the work, even when he was conducting it in a truncated form at the premiere of his Ninth Symphony.  In his mind, though, where music existed in a pure state, it must have been like this Blu-ray disc.  For the love of music, thank you, FARAO CLASSICS!",1289692800,4,2335,5.073490813648294
8398261,4,B003JMGKJG,"The performances and recording are very good. I'm withholding a star only because I haven't been able to listen to the Pure Audio version as much as I'd like.  After one flawless play, my BD player has developed an issue with this disc and sets up a white noise sound that completely drowns out the music.  The issue seems only to be with my player as I've tested the disc on other systems and it's fine.  I'm a little mystified by the problem and have tried adjusting every setting I can find.  However it played beautifully once, and I'm sure it will again when I sort out this issue.  Luckily the package comes with a regular CD version which I've been listening to in the car with great pleasure.  I'm keen for the Pure Audio format to take off and not go the way of DVD-A, or the faltering SACD (faltering in marketing terms).",1286582400,,831,4.363636363636363
8398262,1,B003JMGKJG,"The one star has nothing to do with the performance which is excellent. It is because no where in Amazon publication there is any hint about this being and audio blu-ray only. I am sorry, it has a picture where the names and the current chapter are indicated. Anyway you get a blu-ray disc and a CD. Both with the same music. If you split them to two persons then the price is reasonable. The problem is that you have one jewel-box. You have to buy another one.",1281571200,3,461,4.25
