8578837,5,B00C94VTGE,Very good video of Space Battleship Yamato 2199.  Picture and sound are A+++.,1446163200,,77,4.923076923076923
8578838,5,B00C94VTGE,"If you bought the US released blu-ray disks from starblazers.com, they end at vol. 4, episode 16. This is the ending, episodes 23-26. The Japanese release has much nicer packaging with a full color booklet and slipcover. Disk contains English subtitles.

This is the end of the series. Iscandar has much more back-story, more detail, and actually makes some sense. They keep the series trend of one starship-on-starship action episode, followed by one episode focused on the crew.",1438214400,2,480,5.153846153846154

8578841,5,B00C94VTGE,"It was a really good retelling of a series I loved in my youth.  Am glad it turned out so well.  Now to see what they do with it, when it gets converted for North America release.",1402790400,2,179,3.810810810810811
8578842,3,B00C94VTGE,"if you view this series only  and never see the original  series from 1979 then sure you may just adore the story--visually  great-- good job on people  creation planets and coloring inside the ships very high def
Earth is attacked by the gamalons in the year 2199 as they are seeking a new home -- they start with planet bombs  with radiation bombs  and in 1 year  all life will be  extinct -- queen starsha offers the people of earth  hope to restore the planet and life  as well as technology needed to travel 180,0000 light years  away from earth to her planet to receive  the technology needed to restore the planet---then return  to earth  its a long journey through the cosmos  so its  good sci fi

I have the original 1979 dvd series ! alas for me  the  new version changes every episode  from the original  story lines and  places are  not the same  so its an entirely new story-- Ive gotten used to the original story so I can't like this  new  version.
I do like how there's more charectors than in the original but  it also means  less  things for the original charectors to do  so its different  but they look pretty good.  man so many changes its crazy ! by viewing  yamato 2199  here you clearly like this version -- so enjoy it-- don't view the original  heck if  amazons prices are  accurate  i don't think anyone is going to look at original series unless its by download  enjoy the series!  i like the lighting done in ships  and cosmos  maby they will make more  story of this good quality  -owens",1401148800,2,1517,4.36
8578843,5,B00C94VTGE,the final installment of the 2199 series been waiting for it since I ordered volume 6. This picks up where the last episode left off with a different take on the arrival on gamilon and when the leave iscandar. The series doesn't disappoint if u haven't picked this one up yet what are u waiting for.,1390521600,4,299,4.357142857142857
8578844,5,B00C94VTGE,"They have batted the ball out of the park with this new series!  If you were a fan of the original you will not be dissappointed with this!  Graphics and animation rock, soundtrack and especially the slight tweaks to the story.
Turned my kids onto this and they love it.
An absolute winner!",1389139200,2,290,4.452830188679245
