8392856,3,B003A7VWF2,Fun old movie but not on par with some of the old time comedies. One the whole family could watch.,1448064000,,98,3.95
8392857,3,B003A7VWF2,"Fun
Totally worth a watch. Justice is full of bombast. Phillips is wonderful, lechy, spirited and goofy But watch out for the sublimely oily Kenneth Williams",1431993600,,157,5.076923076923077
8392858,3,B003A7VWF2,"Mildly amusing British comedy.  As others have said, it plays like a more subdued version of the ""Carry On"" films.  If you like those films, as I do, you may enjoy it.  Always nice to see the wonderful Liz Fraser, who gives us a little cleavage in one scene.  Thanks very much, Liz.",1425945600,,282,4.264150943396227
8392859,5,B003A7VWF2,"It's essentially ""Carry On Conducting,"" featuring the director and many of the Carry On regulars.  The plot, however, is tighter than most of those charming flicks - and the humor a bit more family friendly.  Well, well worth.  (Note: this film is currently ONLY available via Amazon Prime streaming.  You won't find it on a region 1 DVD, for rent through Amazon or any other streaming or rent-by-mail services.  Stream it ASAP!)",1387152000,2,429,4.902777777777778
8392860,4,B003A7VWF2,This has a real flare to it and the students life is funny acidents and other interesting things that come along make it a good movie to watch.,1369785600,,143,4.142857142857143
8392861,4,B003A7VWF2,"I should confess right away that I spent two years as a student in a
conservatory, and have spent all my life hanging around with musicians.
I'm sure that influenced my positive opinion about this movie, and I
can understand why others who don't share my background don't
find it funny.

I knew I was going to enjoy it when the opening credits featured
cartoons by the inimitable Gerard Hoffunung. The cast list also
promised a host of Britain's most amusing character players. The script
and direction are by Bruce Montgomery, a fine mystery writer and film
composer. And how odd that the opening scene outside the music school
used the exact same filming location as was used for the hospital in
""Doctor in the House."" (Not to mention that the doctor's nemesis also
plays the students' nemesis here, too.)

Unfortunately, most of the actors
are too old for their ""student"" roles, and the plot is fairly thin (but
typical for a sitcom). What's funny for me are all the jokes and
situations that any working musician will have had to deal with:
overbearing teachers, time-wasting teachers, blabbing conductors,
over-confident student hot-shots, conflict between ""serious"" and ""pop""
music, etc. If you don't know who Barbirolli and Sargent are, you'll
miss a couple of jokes. (And you might not also catch the ""skeletons on
a tin roof"" joke from Sir Thomas Beecham.) There's even a tip of the
hat to Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope, if you look carefully at
the music school sign.

The 90 minutes breezed by, and the HD version available on Amazon Prime
looked pristine on my iPad. Recommended highly for musical people; and
fairly highly for fans of mid-century British comedy. Kenneth Williams
alone is worth the price of admission.",1361404800,,1737,4.921501706484642
