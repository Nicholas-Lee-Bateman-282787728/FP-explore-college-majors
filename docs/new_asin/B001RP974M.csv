3777219,3,B001RP974M,"First of all, it's been a while since I've seen the first, so I'm
judging this based on this movie alone. Over all, this is a decent
movie. The acting is decent by most of the cast and it seems to be well
cast. The storyline is surprisingly good. It's easy to follow and after
the first 30 minutes it will keep you watching. But you have to give it
those 30 minutes to get into it.

No, contrary to popular belief Audrina does not have a big part in the
movie. She's on screen all of 5 minutes (and that's generous). I have
no idea how that rumor came about.

If you want a movie just to watch to kill time, this is that movie. It
won't wow you but it will keep you entertained as the story really is a
good one. I was surprised that it was as good as it is.",1239753600,15,758,3.8838709677419354

3777343,2,B001RP974M,"Oh, where do I begin with this movie? I can tell you that I have an open mind when it comes to movies that are straight to video, especially sequels or prequels that have little or nothing to do with the movie that it follows. When it comes to movies like this, there are some that I actually like, for example, the ""Death Race"" prequels. Some that I am in the middle though leaning towards the negative side like ""Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins Ball"" and ""Never Back Down 2: The Beat Down."" This movie, on the other hand, falls under the category of some that I cannot actually enjoy because of the bad writing and direction.

How I ended up with this movie was that I remember buying it at some new/used record store because I already had the original ""Into The Blue"" movie, which I bought at a closing Blockbuster store. Now I am not going to pretend that the original was some masterpiece because it really wasn't, but it was entertaining in some areas and it did have some star power in Jessica Alba and the late Paul Walker (RIP). Of course, I can say that one of the redeeming factors about that movie are Alba and Ashley Scott looked great not wearing a lot. There were also some good underwater sequences and decent action sequences in it. The story could have been better, though. The acting was not a lot to write home about either, but I thought it was a fun movie.

This movie, on the other hand, had the same potential but fell flat in some areas. Now bear with me here, there is no denying that the absolute beauty of the female actresses like Laura Vandervoort, Mircea Monroe and Marsha Thomason. Even Audrina Patridge and some of the other women in this movie were great to look at. Does that make the movie any good? I'm afraid not. There were also great underwater sequences and nice shots of Hawaii. That was the other redeeming factor. Now where are the bad parts?

Here they go. The movie suffered from bad writing and direction and pointless sequences, not to mention plot points that that didn't start coming up until about halfway or more through the film. One pointless sequence involved Audrina Patridge. While she was listed in the credits on the back of the DVD box as well as having a picture of her on it, she didn't really play a huge role. Her role was pointless and annoying, only good thing I could say is that she looks great in a bikini. I can that I saw that the British couple in this movie were the villains from a mile away, but they had to add in some anti-war subtext out of the blue.

I could go on about the flaws of this movie. I know that the movie had stunning visuals, great shots of the scenery, both the Hawaiian locations AND the gorgeous women, but that doesn't make the movie any good.",1389744000,,2734,4.375984251968504
3777344,5,B001RP974M,If you are a fan of romantic action movies then this is one for you to watch it has the equal amount of romance as it does action and it is a good movie to watch with friends and family,1376265600,,185,3.65
3777345,5,B001RP974M,"It was a great movie over all and a terrific thriller  which is what I most enjoy. The story moved well and I was not really bored. I thought that Marsha Thomason did well to portray a sinister woman--soemthing that I grew up--great actors. I believe that she is under rated and ready for more challenging roles. I could have done without the volleyball scences but other than that it was a good movie. It was also nice to see them end up with the treasure in the end.

3777347,2,B001RP974M,"I read several other reviews before purchasing, and this is definitely NOT better than the first one. There is some gratuitous nudity that was not needed. At least in the first ""Into the Blue"", the actors could act and there was a tangible chemistry. Not so much in this one. Not one I would recommend watching this unless you get it for free, and even then I wasn't impressed.",1361059200,,377,4.478260869565218
3777348,3,B001RP974M,"One of the few times I can recall where a budget sequel was actually better than the original. Or original reboot as it were.

I suspect in part because I have a greater affinity toward Laura Vandervoort than Jessica Alba. Both are very beautiful actresses and talented performers, but Laura has that intangible quality about her - a knowing innocence. Like the artists of the golden age who had to quietly exude sexuality without any censor catching on; to playfully toy without an overtly suggesting. It's a very rare skill nowadays where it's just too easy to reveal or grope various body parts. Skillful coyness is not a talent many still possess today - she's one of the few.

The story is also improved from the first reboot, enhancing the original plot and giving it a different kind of energy, which I appreciated. Having already done the drug dealer thing, it's usually best to try and seek your own path; discover your own direction to achieve the best results.

Plot Outline: Dani, Sebastian and Mace have spent the last few years searching for a legendary Spanish galleon, The San Cristobal, that went down in a storm off the coast of the Hawaiian Island of O'ahu. After four centuries, most believe the tale to be just that - a tale, a fanciful legend that allows tour operators to solicit business from vacationing tourists. But one has to make a living while searching, so they also do the diving tours thing and hunt for the galleon in their spare time. While not a spectacular life, it's one that they've settled into.

Until one day a mysterious couple hires the team to search for the legendary lost ship and her treasure. Seeing it as a way to hit two birds with one stone, they agree to take them to the historical dive spots. One never knows if today will be The Day - right?

Unfortunately, that's not what the wealthy adventure seeking couple are hoping to accomplish. And what they're searching for means the dive team are soon fighting for their lives - and the lives of everyone on the island.

Can they extract themselves from the murderous parties who are desperately trying to recover an unspeakably dangerous cargo - so dangerous that everyone who comes in contact with it or even has knowledge about its existence ends up dead?

Not saying this is some amazing, incredible film. I'm not.

But, you know, kicking back with a bag of popcorn, it ain't bad. And honestly, can one really get tired watching Laura Vandervoort in a string bikini?

3777349,2,B001RP974M,"I had low expectations when I streamed this, but it was worse than I expected. It's not often I say this, but it was poorly shot.  Numerous scenes are backlit. Not in a good arty way, but in a bad lighting, bad cinematography way. The score was pretty terrible as well. As a guy, the biggest reason to watch this is the Vandervoot eye candy and even that was somewhat disappointing. The plot was ok, but it just didn't have the intrigue of the original.  My advice: Rewatch the first one instead of watching this.",1341014400,,513,4.389473684210526
3777350,5,B001RP974M,"This movie held my interest till the end.  Pretty good story line and the scenery was very nice.  Acting maybe a low ""B"",  but still worth while to watch.  I was not disappointed.",1339372800,,179,4.333333333333333
3777351,4,B001RP974M,"The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.

Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing. A few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two big containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.

The movie also has a back story about another person (brother of the lead character) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown.

However apart from that, this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters return",1323648000,3,1342,4.275590551181103
3777372,3,B001RP974M,"The story drifts along lazily going nowhere, then POW, it wakes up, and we have death, mayhem, and not a little action.  The problem is, this doesn't happen until the final fourth of the film and by then it's a bit late in the game to try tossing in a plot.  Unfortunately, that plot is a bit too familiar, something seem almost weekly on any TV show you'd care to mention.

It works as a diversion but nothing you'd care to keep for future viewings.  At least I'm not keeping it.",1322697600,,480,4.241758241758242
3777373,5,B001RP974M,"I wasn't all that impressed with either 1977's ""The Deep"" or the film it inspired 28 years later, 2005's ""Into the Blue."" They were decent oceanic thrillers but that's about it. I liked the actors in both -- Nick Nolte, Robert Shaw & Jacqueline Bisset in ""The Deep"" and Paul Walker, Scott Caan & Jessica Alba in ""Into the Blue"" -- but unless you're rabid fans of Bisset and Alba (or the guys) neither film ever rose above the level of average.

2009's direct-to-video ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is a sequel-in-name-only that successfully builds on the template of those other two films, delivering a far more entertaining experience IMHO.

""Into the Blue 2"" simply has a more engaging story, more dazzling filmmaking and better, more numerous bikini-clad ladies. In other words, everything that you might be looking for in an island thriller is here, only better than those earlier pictures. Although the main cast is relatively no-name (Chris Carmack, Laura Vandervoort, Marsha Thomason & Dave Anders), they do a splendid job; plus the film is highlighted by two solid cameos of Parvati Shallow (""Survivor"") and Adrina Patridge, both incredibly gorgeous. Another highlight is the ultra-serious and thrilling final act, which comprises the last 35 minutes or so. Up to that point the story is pretty much just a fun, light-hearted beach/diving flick. The dramatic change in tone works in the film's favor and keeps it from being one-dimensional.

Since ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is a direct-to-video release it cost a fraction the expense of ""The Deep"" and ""Into The Blue,"" the latter of which cost a whopping $50 million, believe it or not. This makes an interesting study: Filmmakers can make better films at a fraction of the cost; it's simply a matter of ingenuity. Hats off to director Stephen Herek, writer Mitchell Kapner and the cast - awesome job!

""Into the Blue 2"" was shot in Hawaii whereas the other two were filmed in the Caribbean.

The runtime is 92 minutes.

  This movie is so bland compaired to the 1st. One person said that the acting wasn't bad, & that you couldn't tell that it was a B movie.

A lot of the free filming for the movie was done well with Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his wife Dani (Laura Vandervoort) playing in the ocean. It certainly gave Hawaii even more credit to it's beautiful beaches and landscapes. But as for ""action"" scenes, not so much. An example would be when Chris is fighting Carlton (David Anders) on the boat, Dani Girl. That was one of the worst fake fights ever filmed. You can get better footage on youtube. A lot of the chase scenes and ocean scenes are very erratic as relating to camera stability.
This movie followed the same path as the original, but on a cheaper budget. There are many similarities between the two movies if you just think about it. Both are chasing a dream to find buried treasure, but during their quest they stumble upon unfortunate events and are forced into doing things that would jeopardize their lives. The same character dies but in a different manor (Ashley Scott & Mircea Monroe). Josh Brolin and David Anders are killed in similar ways, by a harpoon gun.
The story line was unfortunately predictable , the acting was sub par, and the ""terrorist"" villain has been done enough times.
Laura Vandervoort is a good actress, but the movie itself, doesn't put any spot light on her acting. Audrina Patridge is horrible. For a second there, I thought she was reading off a queue board, then I realized she's just a bad actress.
Overall, don't buy the movie, don't even rent it. Let one of your friend's rent it instead and then watch it.",1240704000,,1526,4.676579925650557
3777381,4,B001RP974M,"""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is the sequel to the 2005 film starring Jessica Alba and Paul Walker.  This straight-to-DVD release stars recognizable talent from popular television series in a suspenseful thriller in the seas featuring beautiful cinematography from Hawaii.

Taking the helm of director is Stephen Herek who has directed ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"", ""The Mighty Ducks"", ""101 Dalmatians"" and the Director of Photography is Thomas Yasko  who worked on ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Alias"" and ""Felicity"" and underwater cinematography work by Don R. King who has worked on films and television series such as ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""LOST"", ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""Cast Away"" and ""Riding Giants"".

Overall, I was thinking this may be a low budget indie film but actually, this film was better than what I was expecting.  Read on.

The film kicks off with a message that there are millions of dollars of treasure in the ocean waiting to be found.  We see two large containers being dropped into the ocean.

The film then begins in Honolulu, Hawaii. The person who dumped the large containers goes to meet with a few guys in suits expecting to get paid.  But because he dumped the containers and altering the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.

We are then taken underwater in the blue ocean as Sebastion (Chris Carmack from ""The O.C."") and his wife Dani (Laura Vandervoort from ""Smallville"") are dive surfing with a model.  We learn that the group own a snorkling business that rents out equipment for clients.  For Sebastion, doing this line of work for people's vacations is not a line of work he wants to do forever.

For Sebastion, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship ""San Cristobal"" which sunk somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure.

Sebastion believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his wife the opportunity to live a better life.

Sebastion hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei from ""Young and the Restless"" and ""90210') and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe from ""Drive""), Dani's best friend,  who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Avery tends to mess around with other women.  Where Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship, Sebastion and Dani are very much in love.

While at work, they are visited by Carlton (David Anders from ""ALIAS"" and ""HEROES"") and Azra (Marsha Thomason from ""LOST""), a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the San Cristobal.

Of course, Sebastion has been trying for several years to find it but Carlton happens to have a map which may lead them to the treasure. So, both Sebastion and Dani agree to help the couple. The four go on various diving expeditions to find treasure.

We then get to see some of the beach life as all six individuals enjoy the beach.  Dani and Kimi and Sebastion and Mace get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions.  Sebastion and Mace go against their main diving competitors, Avery (Rand Holdren) who dates a girl named Kelsey (Audrina Patridge from ""The Hills"") who loves to lecture him when he gets into trouble by messing around with women.

While at a club, a random guy hits on the women and grabs the arm of Azra and Azra quickly puts him in a headlock.  This raises the first red flag for Dani who becomes suspicious.

The following day we learn that Carlton is not really looking for the San Cristobal.  He actually helps big clients smuggle treasure to other locations.  Both Carlton and Azra tell Sebastion and Dani that if they help them find the two containers, they will earn $500,000.  Also, we learn that if Carlton doesn't find the containers in a week, the men will kill them.  The reason why he is willing to pay them a lot of money is part of an apology because the men who hired him know the names of Sebastion and Dani and their lives are in danger too.

So, now both Sebastion and Dani are forced to help Carlton and Azra find the two containers but while they are at sea, Avery takes notice and he starts looking to find whatever they are looking for.

With their lives threatened, Dani convinces Sebastion that they must look to see what is in those containers and why their lives are being threatened.  Something terrible could be in those containers and that they need to check them without bringing Carlton and Azra along.

Thus, the two take their boat out to see late at night to dive and see what those containers are.  What they find in the containers are not treasure but a bomb.  When they return from their boat after the dive, they are greeted by Carlton and Azra have been hiding in their boat and are ready to kill them.  Carlton tells him that in container one is the casing and in container two is a nuclear warhead.  One without the other is useless but together creates a powerful weapon.  Their goal is to create a second Pearl Harbor.

Will Sebastion and Dani be able to get some help or escape to safety or will they get killed by these terrorists?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is presented in widescreen and was filmed in High Definition.  Picture quality for the film is actually quite nice as it was filmed in Oahu, Hawaii and they hired one of the best diving camera crews in Hawaii.  Thus you get really beautiful shots of the group diving and coming across the reefs and various marine life.  Most of the film is shot outdoors, so you really get a good taste of Hawaii through the cinematography.

As for audio, the film is presented in English Dolby Surround 5.1 sound. The majority of the film is front channel heavy with the film being dialogue and at times music driven.  If anything, the music creates the atmosphere during the action sequence.  Overall, dialogue and music is quite clear and easily heard.

Overall, the DVD looked and sounds really good but because this film was shot in HD, I would imagine that the picture quality to be much better if this film was released ala 1080p High Definition on Blu-ray.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The following ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" special features are included:

  * ""Get Wet"" Featurette - (11:42) This featurette shows how the underwater scenes were filmed.  Interview with Director Stephen Herek and the talent. Learning how the main cast had to go through scuba driving training.  We learn how the guys enjoyed it, for Laura Vandervoort, she watched a shark attacks documentary and thus was a bit scared of sharks.  As for Marsha Thomason, being from the UK and with thick hair, she wasn't a water person.  Interviews with Day Vinson, the scuba instructor and learning about the crash course lessons for the talents.  Interviews with Producer Hudson Hickman in regards to why Hawaii was chosen versus Catalina.  Interviews wtih Don R. King (Underwater Unit: Director of Photography) and how he and Director Herek communicated and directed while Herek was viewing a monitor on a ship.  An enjoyable and interesting featurette.
  * ""Run For Your Life"" Featurette - (6:42) In the film is an action chase scene in which Laura Vandervoort had to run around Hawaii.  Director Stephen Herek talked about how he wanted to capture get a ""Run Lola Run"" type of feel between Vandervoort and Thomason's characters running in Hawaii.  Vandervoort's character Dani had to run barefoot for long distances, but overall watching her, she was so excited to do an action scene thus she gave it her all for that scene.  Featuring an interview with Producer Craig Roessler.  Interviews with Director Stephen Herek, actress Laura Vandervoort and Marsha Thomason and Director of Photography Thomas Yatsko.
  * ""Back To The Beach"" Music Video - (1:40) A short behind-the-scenes music video of shooting the beach volleyball and club scene, plus the lovemaking and scuba diving scenes and showing the talents having fun on the set.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Overall, I'm a sucker for beach films, especially when it comes to cinematography in Hawaii.  So, I may be a bit biased because ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" looks absolutely beautiful.

If anything, it was quite interesting to see the cast for the film of stars from popular television shows together.  The main talents of the film did a very good job and Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort definitely had great chemistry while David Anders and Marsha Thomason definitely have that star power from being in ""ALIAS"", ""HEROES"" and ""LOST"" which definitely peaked my interest when I first saw these two together.

Many people are wondering how Audrina Patridge of MTV's ""The Hills"" is featured and first, I will say that Audrina's appearance in the film is short and her scene is not major.  But knowing how popular ""The Hills"" stars have become, I suppose that it works out to be a small positive cameo for the film which has many TV stars, so it all works out.  If anything, her role is actually quite humorous and her cameo seems to have been tacked onto the storyline to reach that demographic who are fans of her and the series.

""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" overall was actually entertaining.  It was much better than I expected and for a film that was created with a smaller budget than the original and done with a shorter schedule, from what they were able to accomplish in Hawaii and Catalina, I felt everything worked out and there was no sign of ""low-budget"" indie film cheapness.

Again, the talent are people from popular television shows with the exception of Patridge who is in a drama reality show but overall, everyone did a pretty good job.  Also, watching the special features, everyone was quite enthusiastic to take part in the film, so that was pretty cool!

If there was any problem that I had with the film, it was regarding Azra's character at the end.  Her actions and her mentioning ""the war"".  So, I wish things were a bit clear about her character and that final scene with her.

Overall, the first film didn't really have me expecting much for the sequel but after watching ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"", I enjoyed the film.  Again, since this film was shot in High Definition, I hope 20th Century Fox considers releasing this film on Blu-ray because the cinematography is just beautiful.

All in all, ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is an entertaining film worth checking out!",1240272000,4,10479,4.704720087815588
