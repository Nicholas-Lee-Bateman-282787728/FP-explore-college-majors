8027388,5,B0002ER4KI,"This movie contains some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. The plot is typical, but it contains twists that differ from many of the Kung Fu movies from the era. This movie is packed with fighting, and has a great range of martial arts techniques. The soundtrack is unbelievable, although impossible to find nowadays. The English translation is way above par for the era.

This movie is a must see for any martial arts fan.",1525910400,,431,4.5256410256410255

8027390,5,B0002ER4KI,"I agree with you Daniel 100 percent (5 out of 5 stars)! And these are my reasons why:

1) Just like another reviewer on here, I actually went to the movies to see this when I was a kid and it brings back a lot of fond memories for me. BTW, this movie also goes by the name, ""BRUCE LEE'S DEADLY KUNGFU"".

2) Have you ever seen a movie that was so ""Bad"" it was ""Good""? This is it! Some of the characters are 1978 stereotypes and some of the dialog is bad too (i.e. - ""I don't care if his name is Charlie or Lassie! Get him out of here!""; ""Chinese KungFu? - No, Chinese Boxing!""; ""Hey, what do we do? Hah, hah, hah!""; ""I want you to beat the sh** out of that Chinese guy!"" - - I love it!!!)

3) In my opinion, Bruce Li is one of the most underrated martial artists. In this movie, he really shows his skill and there's none of that wire-work crap that most KungFu movies have nowadays. (Personally, I have never seen Bruce Li as a replacement for Bruce Lee, and with all do respect, I don't think anyone else should think that either).

4) Finally, I think the pacing of the movie is great. You actually care about the characters your watching and hate the bad guys for beings bullies and jerks! The movie starts out with a few guys being thugs, until they slowly send better and better fighters to finally beat Bruce Li. Of course, Bruce Li after being beaten, comes back for his revenge and takes out the big ""Boss"" himself. Formulaic, yes. But it works! At the end, you will find yourself rooting for Bruce Li to beat the crap out of these jerks! (And isn't that what a good movie is about?)",1505692800,,1591,4.1558441558441555

8027392,5,B0002ER4KI,"I love this movie, but my praise will have to wait until I make sure a few important facts are established for those out there unfamiliar with Bruceploitation films.  First and foremost, Bruce Lee does not appear in this picture, nor does it have the first thing to do with the real Bruce Lee; the star of the film is Ho Chung Tao (aka Li Shao Lung), better known as Bruce Li.  Li is regarded by and large as the best of the Bruce Lee clones (and I might point out he never really embraced the concept of being renamed after his idol).  It is unfair to even compare him to Bruce Lee because Li is a pretty darn good martial arts star in his own right.  With this movie, he won me over completely.  Another important fact about this film concerns the title: these Bruceploitation films of the mid- to late-70s are notorious for having different titles.  This 1976 film is probably best known as Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu, although you may very well see it called Bruce Lee's Secret or Story of the Dragon; additional but less common titles include Bruce Li's Jeet Kune Do, A Dragon Story, and He's a Legend, He's a Hero.  You really have to be careful when buying Bruceploitation films such as this because each movie has a ridiculous number of  titles.

As for the movie itself, the plot is a very familiar one.  Li plays ""Bob"" Lee, a young Chinese man working in San Francisco; he and his friend are bullied by a trio of thugs, and Bob's decision to teach the guys a little respect for the Chinese lands him and his buddy out of work.  For some reason, the scraggly American guys Bob put a licking on exercise some control over Chinatown, making it very difficult for our hero to find a new job.  When he does get a job working on the docks, the roughnecks show up along with some of their friends to beat everybody there up.  Bob finally has to do his thing again, after which his coworkers convince him to open his own school and teach them kung fu.  If you've seen The Chinese Connection (or just about any other martial arts film), you know this means trouble with the schools already in existence (all of which are, of course, rife with bad guys).  Well, as you can well imagine, the conflict escalates.  Two things make this particular film a little different, though.  For one, Bob is defeated at one point by what I assume was supposed to be some type of Japanese karate expert, forcing him to rethink his strategy and thereby come up with his own personalized form of kung fu.  This provides a window in which a tiny bit of the essence of kung fu is explained to the audience.  Second, in the final conflict, Bob has to deal with an unusual weapon, which makes the predictable climax a little more interesting.

A good many Bruceploitation fans don't seem to care for this film, but I loved it.  As I said, the plot is pretty similar to that of many a martial arts film, but this story works for me, particularly with the emphasis Bob places on disproving the idea that the Chinese are cowards; everyone who gets in his way is made to respect the Chinese.  Some who know more about kung fu than I do (and I basically know nothing about it) aren't that impressed with the fight scenes featured in the movie, but I thought they were outstanding.  Bruce Li impressed me more here than in any other of his movies I have seen so far.  The action is fast and furious, particularly the one fight between Bob and the Japanese assassin sent to kill him.  The final battle scenes were especially good, as Bob had to single-handedly go through several heavy layers of bad guys in order to reach the man he was really after.

Formulaic it may be, but Bruce Lee's Secret is one of my favorite Bruceploitation films, and Bruce Li impressed the heck out of me with his fighting skills in this one.  It can be hard for a fan of the real Bruce Lee to embrace the string of Bruceploitation films that were churned out in the years after his death, and many a Lee fan will not watch any of them.  As long as they do nothing to tarnish the image of Lee, however, I can't get enough of them, and Bruce Lee's Secret is one of the best ones out there.",1137542400,3,4139,4.347204161248374
8027393,2,B0002ER4KI,"""Bruce Lee's Secret"" is a biopic about Bruce Lee's early years in the USA. For some reason, however (probably legal reasons), his name has been changed to 'Bob.' He is played by veteran Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Li, who does a servicable job. The film traces 'Bob's' work in a Chinese restaurant where he makes enemies with a local gang, opening his own kung fu school, the creation of 'jeet kun do,' and...er, more run-ins with gangs. This seems to have been shot mostly in an Asian suburb/park, giving the movie a strange low-budget feel. It's not a whole lot more interesting than any other Bruceploitation movie, although there are plenty of fight scenes, particularly towards the end.

The DVD from Jalisco is in 1.33:1, heavily cropped from the film's probably 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is a bit sharper than expected, although still fairly scratchy. The dubbed sound is as you'd expect. There are, unsurprisingly, no extras. The menu design and the box are both blah.",1104537600,,978,4.8562874251497
