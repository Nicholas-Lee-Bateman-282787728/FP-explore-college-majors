Keep in mind it is in Japanese with English subtitles.  Not bad for a movie of that time and style.",1453420800,,253,4.163265306122449

7983704,2,B00008G8AI,"but the action, horror or sex-wise, is not very lively.  Very disapointed in this tame and uninteresting low-budget exploitation flick.  The gore, special effects are minimal and so is the nudity and sex.  The greenish cover with the girl on all fours with tentalces around her is arguably the most exploitive thing about the entire film.  There are some cute Japanese girls and a scene or two of note maybe, but that just means it's worth a rental at best.  With a poor film and no major extras, a purchase is not recommended.  For something a little more explicit, gruesome, and weird, try Entrails of a Beautiful Woman, if you can stomach it that is.  As for Angel of Darkness(#1), I say skip it and save your money, time, and energy.

Note: I don't know if the rest in the series are as bad, as the first one was poor enough to make me not bother with the others.",1127952000,5,867,4.408805031446541
7983705,3,B00008G8AI,The cover is live action. The content is animation. I felt duped. Still the story was really well done.,1127606400,,103,4.473684210526316
7983706,3,B00008G8AI,"Those familiar with Japanese soft-porn will fell right at home with this unexceptional title. Those whom are uninitiated will be caught a bit off guard.

At a high school in Tokyo, several of the female students have been moon-lighting as prostitutes. A teacher catches onto this fact and goes about putting an end to it. Things go awry when he discovers he turns into a sex demon with tentacles whenever he gets aroused (huh?). He turns from savior to vilifier, poor prostitute school girls.

There are some deaths, but no blood or gore. The sex scenes are a mixed bag; some are pretty good, others are short and uninteresting. There is nudity aplenty and the material is definitely on the odd side, but fans of the anime will find it too tame to warrant continued interest.

Better if you aren't familiar with the genre.

7983707,1,B00008G8AI,"Ok when I picked this one up I wasn't expecting much, and that is what I got.  I thought it would at least be good for a few laughs, but that never happened.  What I did get was one of the most boring horror stories ever.  While I did like how the movie started, I slowly started to realize that the story was slowing down.  Then it gets to the finally, and I was practicly asleep.  This is the second time a hentai movie put me to sleep (the first was Magical Twilight).  Stay far away from this! ....",994896000,,502,4.02020202020202
7983708,4,B00008G8AI,"For those unfamiliar with Anime', the term ""hentai"" is Japanese, equating roughly to soft-core porn, which is a very apt description of the  entire Angel of Darkness series.
This particular video is the 'general  release' version, shortened by between 5 and 7 minutes.  Although the  footage removed is not central to the  plot (it's mostly graphic sex), the  editing is a bit sloppy and makes the movie look rather choppy.
Overall,  the story is interesting and well developed.  The animation is very good.  This volume of the set produces an odd mix for anime', combining  demonic/monster characters with more traditional fantasy characters.  I  won't go into detail, as that might reveal too much of the story.  Suffice  it to say, the result is a surprisingly effective and entertaining alliance  between the human heroine and her non-human allies.
Like all  ""hentai"" films, ""Angel of Darkness"" is ultra-violent  and contains plenty of graphic sex.  It's hard to say either the violence  or sex is gratuitous, since without them there would be no story.  This  one, however, is done a bit more intelligently and tastefully than some  others (remember, that's a comparison, not an absolute!).
No matter how  you approach it, ""Angel of Darkness"" is strictly adult material.  The characters may be animated, but they aren't cartoonish.  Neither are  their actions.  Keep this one out of the hands of children.",962928000,6,1410,5.096916299559472
