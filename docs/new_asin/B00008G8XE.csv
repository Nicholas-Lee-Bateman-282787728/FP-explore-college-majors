7983338,1,B00008G8XE,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,,615,4.811320754716981
7983339,3,B00008G8XE,"The same old recycled ""public domain"" episodes of THE LUCY SHOW...  Just about every single budget-line DVD company you can think of has trundled out these shows.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased the episodes over and over again, but for new viewers looking to introduce themselves to the hilarity of Lucy's world, this is a good place to start.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Mooney the Monkey"" - Overworked Lucy is convinced that an escaped monkey in the bank is actually Mr. Mooney!  Guest starring Janos Prohaska.

""Lucy and the Ring-a-Ding-Ding"" - Whilst admiring a ring that Mooney has purchased for his wife, Lucy slips it on her finger...where it promptly becomes stuck.

""Lucy the Starmaker"" - Lucy helps Mr. Cheever's nephew (guest star Frankie Avalon) launch a career in showbusiness.

""Lucy Meets Robert Goulet"" - When a truck driver is turned down for a loan, Lucy enters him in a Robert Goulet look-alike contest.

""Lucy Gets a Roommate"" - Mousy librarian Carol Bradford (special guest star Carol Burnett) seems like the perfect flatmate...

""Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs"" - With the tempting offer of a free vacation, Lucy joins Carol and her musical act for an engagement at a golfing tournament.

""Lucy and the Submarine"" - Lucy gets trapped aboard a submarine while delivering some bank papers to Mr. Mooney.",1283472000,3,1811,4.882352941176471
