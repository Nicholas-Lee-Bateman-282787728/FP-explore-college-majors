8546922,5,B00A6GW1O6,Wow what a great documentary and moving human story! Watch it and you will be moved to tears at several points (particularly when Hamlet gives up his spirit but also as the main actor / director talks about sons and fathers and how the character Hamlet's concerns mirror his own about his two sons (shown on screen). A fine movie that would repay a second viewing if you like Shakespeare and the acting profession......,1521590400,,419,4.675675675675675
