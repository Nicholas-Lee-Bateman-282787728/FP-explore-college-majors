1612864,3,B00005JPGI,"COME EARLY MORNING  marks the writing and directing debut of Joey Lauren Adams who elects to share a bit of her birthplace atmosphere in Arkansas and while the story is sound and the writing evocative of the personal turmoil  of little towns populated by good but bored people, there is nothing new here.  But just the opportunity to see gifted actress Ashley Judd strut her stuff is reason enough to watch this little film and makes us wonder where has she been since her 2004 stint in 'De-Lovely'. She is just too fine an actress not to be given more beefy roles.

Lucy Fowler (Judd) lives in a little Arkansas town, a successful contractor with boss Owen Allen (Stacy Keach, another underused fine actor), but a woman without a firm attachment to her fragmented family: her shy and sequestered father (Scott Wilson) has returned to town where he hides in alcohol and steps out only for Holy Roller church services; her grandmothers Doll (Candyce Hinkle) is unstable and keeps to herself and Nana (Diane Ladd) remains in a mutually abusive marriage; and her uncle Tim (Tim Blake Nelson) who is the only stalwart member of the clan.  Lucy lives with her friend Kim (Laura Prepon) who understands Lucy's shortcomings: unable to form relationships, Lucy spends her weekends getting drunk at the local tavern and sleeping with anonymous men whom she deserts a dawn.

But things change when Lucy encounters Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan) who provides her with the first semblance of normalcy in her relationships with men, a frightening new step she abuses by entering into her drinking mode again.  Lucy begins to make changes in her view of her family, her fear of being the mirror image of her father, in her work, and in the way she views men.  And the film just trails off leaving us wondering what life will now be like.

Adams has a fine handle on her subject and creates dialog that feels like it should: her election to make such a fine three-dimensional character out of Lucy's father who barely has a line to say is much to her credit (and the strong performance by Scott Wilson!).  But in the end it is the pleasure of seeing Ashley Judd in a meaty role that makes the difference.  Grady Harp, April 07",1176336000,22,2210,4.670103092783505
1612865,1,B00005JPGI,"I can't understand anyone giving this movie anything but one star. It stinks. It's a tired and overdone plot with a main character who is very hard to care about. I wanted more of the stray dog story. At least that would have given us more to watch. Even Judd's roommate made a more interesting study. The Lucy/Judd character is just plain boring. She drinks. We get it. Coors light. We get it. Please buy it. She poses and plays pool and gets drunk every night. We get it. She drives too fast and she wears the same clothes every day. We get it. She sleeps around with strangers. We get it. She NEVER combs her freakin' hair. We DON'T get it. She is a most unhappy and unlikeable girl. We got it. I won't get the movie, however. I am actually glad I had a free rental here.

Save your dimes and rent Kiss the Girls. At least that was interesting and you cared about Judd's character. And she combed her hair at least once. Sigh",1176163200,9,928,4.242937853107344
1612866,3,B00005JPGI,"Initially, I was drawn into this small movie and wanted to learn more about Lucy (Ashley Judd) and why she was so self-destructive. She is a strong-willed woman in her 30s who wants to be loved, but seeks out men who don't qualify as anything more than one-night-stands. Lucy works hard in the construction business by day and then transforms into a barfly at night. She does a lot of drinking (this movie is also part info-mercial for a certain light beer) and sleeping around with nameless guys she meets when she's drunk. There's also a side story about a sick dog she takes home that was written into the script for some unknown reason. Eventually, Lucy meets Cal, a nice guy who is in love with his car, and struggles to avoid getting too involved with him. She begins to feel something for Cal, until she senses he wants more than she is willing to give, and then she reverts back to drinking and promiscuity and turns him away. This was the part that didn't quite make this an enjoyable romantic movie for me. Lucy is a very attractive woman (even without makeup and uncombed hair) and has a ""girl-next-door"" innocence...until she becomes a foul-mouthed slut after drinking to excess. Flip-flop personality aside, I was somewhat drawn to her. I won't go into the other characters in the story who happen to be her dysfunctional family. They were generally unhappy and there was a connection between them and Lucy's dark side. It was inferred that she acted the way she did because of her father's drinking and womanizing past. I have to say that I was surprised this movie was praised so highly by many critics. I expected more and was left at the end of it with a feeling of ""Is that all there is?""",1175731200,22,1706,4.5602605863192185
1612867,3,B00005JPGI,"""Come Early Morning"" is a portrait of an emotionally bereft small-town Southern woman, written and directed by actress Joey Lauren Adams and starring Ashley Judd, both Southern women themselves. Lucy Fowler (Ashley Judd) is a construction contractor by day and at night hits the bars of her small Arkansas town to get drunk and pick up men -who disgust her by the time she wakes up with them the next morning. Uncomfortable in social situations without alcohol and likewise with men who don't treat her badly, Lucy craves the love of her distant and disinterested father. When a newcomer to town, Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan), is interested in a relationship, not just a one-night stand, Lucy is wary but gives it a try in her own self-defeating way.

Lucy's emotional journey just failed to capture my interest. This territory has been covered many times before. The promiscuous woman who uses sex as a substitute for fatherly love is a clich -and probably a disingenuous one. Ashley Judd looks like she gained weight for the role, and Lucy rarely parts or brushes her hair. These attempts to ""ugly her up"" are conspicuous. Ashley Judd is an attractive woman, and any small-town thirty-something woman who looked like her would be aware of that. Women that age are desperate to preserve their looks, not vandalize them. There is no reason for this character to be plain when she obviously isn't. Ultimately, Lucy is a nice woman whose problems are not so momentous as she thinks, but I tired of her angst and histrionics before the film was over.

The DVD (Weinstein Company 2007): This is a two-sided disc with a widescreen version of the film on one side and full screen version on the other. There are no bonus features. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.",1175644800,12,1777,4.822950819672132
1612868,2,B00005JPGI,"This movie was a good idea. However, it fails to explore the plot fully. It fails to give sufficient background to set up the sins-of-the-fathers story. Why is Judd's character estranged from her father? Vague hints about alcoholism are not enough explanation. Where is her mother? Why is she terrified of commitment? Nothing about past boyfriends is ever mentioned. How, in a town too small to have more than one veterinarian (or more than one bar, it seems) does she manage to find total strangers to sleep with?

The story gets interesting when the protagonist starts looking for answers in the Bible. However, she never solves anything. There is no redemption. There is no sense of sin as anything other than as a curse inflicted on her by her forebears. She has no real sense of guilt, no repentance, no redemption.

Her knight in shining armor is written poorly. If he's so great, why does he take her home with him after their first date? Why does he sleep with her when she's dead drunk? Why doesn't he bother to get to know why she has such serious ""issues"" if he actually cares about her?

Joey Lauren Adams is a fabulous actress. Unfortunately, that may not translate into being a good director. Besides never answering important questions, this movie is repetitive. Every visit to her Nana is the same; every morning waking up in a strange bed is the same; every trip to her grandfather's grave, or her father's church, or her other grandmother's home, is the same. In attempting to show patterns, Adams should let the story break free of the patterns.

This story could have gone downhill, which would have been interesting. Judd's character could get an STD, become pregnant, lose her job, find video of herself on the internet, be injured by one of her one-night stands . . . or all of the above. But no, there are no real consequences for her self-destructive behavior--just a little self-loathing and one unpleasant encounter with a previous Mr. Goodbar. This story could have gone uphill, showing a determination to change, some encouragement to keep trying. It could at least have resulted in some insightful conversations (with the wannabe boyfriend, with the father). Instead, it just fades away (literally) in the sunset.",1175126400,5,2243,4.848563968668407
1612869,3,B00005JPGI,"This is a nice looking and well acted movie, but it's awfully hard to recommend.  Nothing much happens and it's difficult to care very much about any of the characters.  Even though this is a role that is supposedly more suited to Judd's image, I simply found her to be too attractive to be believable as a barfly/slut.  Laura Prepon was wasted as her roommate, as was Stacy Keach as her employer.  Actually I found the whole thing to be a waste of time. A pretty and pleasant waste, but a waste all the same.",1174780800,5,509,4.326315789473684
1612870,5,B00005JPGI,"Even though all the critics loved Ashley Judd's performance in ""Come Early Morning"" (and she even had some support for an Oscar nomination in 2006), others kept harping about how she has wasted her formidable talents in a flood of serial-killer genre movies. Well, she was in a total of three movies that involved serial killers and in one of those her scene wasn't used in the final film. The only reason she gets pegged as Thriller Chick is because those are the only films a mass audience has bothered to watch.

Thanks to nonexistent media saturation, odds are that they'll miss this independent delight, too. Or if they do watch it, they'll hate it because of the bait-and-switch packaging it's received in its DVD release. The cover promises a light and airy, tied-up-in-a-neat-bow-at-the-end, rom-com confection that is miles removed from the scruffy, minimalist, starkly honest, fair-minded, and open-ended slice of semi-rural life that is contained inside. If you need a resolution to all plot threads and relationships at the end of a movie, be forewarned.

I love Ashley's work here. Adams' freshman directorial effort has a few rough edges but that's okay. Just watch it.",1174608000,16,1183,5.030612244897959
1612871,4,B00005JPGI,"Lucy Fowler sleeps around, has big issues with her father, hasn't kissed a man since High School without being drunk and generally thinks little of herself or her well being but manages to be a crack cement contractor respected by her peers...which I like and which would not have occurred had a man written and/or directed this film: who in this case is actress Joey Lauren Adams (""Chasing Amy"").

Ashley Judd plays Lucy like a woman who has long ago given up the search for Mr. Right and is now only looking for someone with whom to spend the night and a lot of men are more than happy to accommodate her. But she remains empty, angry and yet strangely passive and submissive when it comes to her needy relatives who primarily use her to chauffeur them around and referee their arguments.

Then Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan) comes along: new in town, able to look beyond Lucy's obvious faults, honorable, upstanding yet edgy and just a good all around guy. Of course, Lucy is initially attracted and naturally does everything that she can to ruin their relationship.

Writer/Director Adams knows of what she writes and directs here. It is obvious that Lucy is close to her heart and ""Come Early Morning"" as a result is thoughtful, remarkably open-minded, modern and emotionally meaningful.",1164067200,39,1291,4.806306306306307

I spent much of my early years in the emptiness of the bar-room scene. Like her, I struggled with parent-child issues that were a major source of negative feelings such a worthlessness, inadequacy, and such. And I turned to alcohol to buffer me from the pain.  I was happy that the director/writer portrayed her as being willing to grow through some of that.

It has a cheap feel even though recognizable names are present. I could go on, but it wouldn't matter. It simply comes across as a waste of time. The language is too filthy to put up with, and Ms. Judd's character is very one dimensional. It might be believable if she were playing a cheap prostitute, but her character is no ""Pretty Woman"".

1612968,3,B00005JPGI,"Come Early Morning (2006) is a story too close for
comfort, and to reality, for that matter, for a
significant part of the USA population, that has a
non-megacity lifestyle, residing mainly in the
Mid-West.

Based on a story that seems to be rooted back in the
1970's, perhaps in the 1980's (as modern times reaches
all corners of each country at a snail's pace,
unevenly), there's a fair bit of 70's pickup trucks,
traditional country music, etc.

The movie is heavily rooted in the promiscuous
lifestyle of a number of adult men and women from the
town, or driving through it, who don't quite know what
they want from life, in their personal relationships,
being truly chaotic in the intimacy realm, often
jumping from partner to partner.

The soundtrack plays a key role in carrying the story,
building the small-town or countryside atmosphere, (
Willie Nelson, and Bobby Dylan-like, etc.) The filming
is crystal clear, the song selections wisely chosen.

If there's perhaps a questionable approach, it's the
excess detail of the bed-side scenes, (albeit, never
graphic), as well as the numerous scenes that tend to
zoom or center at Ashley Judd's tight jeans pants and
backside, or even, her tight tank tops, or loose
fitting and open ones, her underwear, or showing her
pulling down  her pants, or putting on her pants, for
example.

Judd is also paired with another attractive blonde, her
roommate, throwing in extra eye-candy to sell the
worth.

This approach to selling the film by touching upon a
kind of voyeurism of the actress, under the pretext of
making the story hit home,  may not be understood by
all of the  audience.

At the same time, there is no doubt whatsoever, that a
real segment of the USA population indeed sees itself
in the lifestyle depicted. The aspect of euthanizing a
loved pet, found on the side of a road, also pulls on
the heart strings of the audience, as does the
heartbreak shown to be had by the actress.

The script doesn't shy away from showing family
conflicts, the elderly, the passed away, the relations
of adults in motels, trucks, night clubs and bars.

Interestingly, the moral dimension of human beings is
brought into the story, as one-night-stands time and
again, result in confusion, pain, anguish, suffering,
tantrums, profanity directed at loved ones, tarnished
reputations, etc.

Religion is suggested as an outlet that can alleviate
emotional pain, and also, physical frailty.

Every 5 minutes, it seems someone is opening up a
bottle of bear, having a smoke, an adult seeking
companionship, or intimacy.

Overall, this movie is scary for someone looking for an
uplifting experience at the theatre, but a good DVD
rental.",1241827200,2,2677,4.917777777777777
1612969,4,B00005JPGI,"COME EARLY MORNING

Have you ever seen a movie and thought to yourself afterward that ""man that real"", but not like a documentary but just a piece of cinema that looks like it was plucked out of real life. If you have ever felt that way then chances are that you were watching this one right here. ""Come Early Morning"" is a wonderful little film done marvelously by Joey Lauren Adams of ""Chasing Amy"" fame and starring the great Ashley Judd and of course Jeffrey Donovan. This honestly feels like cameras were set up all around a town and this is what was captured, it feels real.

The film follows Lucy Fowler {Judd} on her journey through her thirties waking up every morning next to one useless guy after another. She also is dealing with a father that she is trying desperately to spend time with even though it seems he could care less. So the story goes she is a desperate and confused woman who is only looking for love and acceptance. Of course you could say that her problems with men steams from her estranged relationship with her father. Still she ends up meeting at least one decent guy named Cal Percell {played excellently by Donovan} who seems that he wants a relationship with her despite her problem. It is this relationship here that is the driving force of the film although the time spent with her father and room mate also add interesting dynamics. The great thing about all this is how it all ends.

Writer/director Adams proves that all that time spent with Kevin Smith paid off because this is a wonderful debut film. Her direction is excellent but it is her writing that really makes this film so good. Like I said this has to be one of the realest movies I have seen in a while. I like the fact that she didn't romanticize the lead character and her problems, things do not end up like you want them to. This movie has an ending that is probably what would actually happen, how great is that? Even those that have not grown up in a small town can relate to the things going on in this movie.

Ashley Judd of course is brilliant as the lost thirty something year old that is trying to find her way. And you know that Jeffery Donovan is excellent as the guy that should have been the one for her. Laura Prepon of ""That 70's Show"" fame is just as good as Judd's room mate and best friend, she even finds love. Also Scott Wilson is brilliant as her finding religion father who seems as out of it as she does. As a matter of fact the entire cast is great and deserves all the credit in the world. Aside from that the film was also shot very well and for such a limited budget it seems like the movie showed the entire town even though it didn't.

I would have to say that this is one of the better movies that has come out in a while, and a wonderful debut for a filmmaker. To those who have seem this I say spread the word and review it now. And for those who have yet to see I recommend this as a purchase but I guess you can try a rental. This is a wonderful film with a great cast with real problems that all should be able to relate to. I would love to go about this film but all can come up with is see it, if it isn't your thing that's ok, but for those who like these types of films you will highly enjoy this.",1241395200,5,3240,4.202572347266881
1612970,5,B00005JPGI,"Come Early Morning is a great movie, with a brilliant performance by Ashley Judd, the most underrated actress today.  The movie is hard and rough but also really very tender.  It's about breaking through and watching as someones life falls apart and seeing how beautiful that can be.  Beauty in the breakdown.",1236643200,2,309,4.903846153846154
1612971,2,B00005JPGI,"""Come early morning"" is about a woman that is tired of her drinking habits, sleeping around and her relationship with her family. The movie was not cohesive enough to deliver a comprehensible plot. The movie was all over the place; never explaining the relationships between the different characters (which remained vague at best), nor the process of growth for Ashley Judd's character, it was merely implied. The movie does not know where to go. Although Judd's performance was good, the rest of the movie did not provide a vehicle where that performance could shine through. Actually, the movie was so vague about pretty much everything that the viewer could not really and truly understand what is going on between the different characters. The movie is also very sad and depressing. Skip it unless you are an Ashley Judd fan.",1226275200,,829,4.971223021582734
1612992,3,B00005JPGI,"I was REALLY interested in seeing a Jeffery Donovan movie.  This definitely fits that bill.  The movie is okay - not the best movie I've ever seen and not one I will watch over and over again.  I don't regret the purchase because I wanted to see more of Mr Donovan's work, but I understand why this didn't really do well at the box office.  It's not a BAD movie but I would have rather paid $8 rather than $15.",1220140800,,410,4.0875

1612994,4,B00005JPGI,"Joey Lauren Adams who acted on the ""Judging Amy"" TV series directs her first feature with ""Come Early Morning.""  Ashley Judd who I enjoyed in the Cole Porter bio pic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/De-Lovely/dp/B00067BBLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">De-Lovely</a>&nbsp;& ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" does a good job as Lucy Fowler who has a lot of alcohol-soaked one night stands but shies from commitment.  Her performance is rich and varied.  I also liked the male lead Jeffrey Donovan who won Best Supporting Actor for ""Sam & Joe"" in 2003 from the Meth Fest that celebrates the actors' ""method"" for realistic acting.  He's worked in TV series like ""Burn Notice"" with Sharon Gless, ""Crossing Jordan"" & ""The Pretender.""  As Cal Percell, he's a sincere guy who tries to establish a loving relationship with Lucy.  Some of their love scenes are very tender.  Lucy's roommate Kim is played by Laura Prepon from ""That 70s Show"" & ""October Road"" TV series.  Her values are quite different as she's looking for substance over flash.  Scott Wilson does a nice job as Lucy's taciturn dad Lowell that she accompanies to a holy roller church.  Diane Ladd with 3 Oscar nominations including ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" plays her grandmother Nana who is in an abusive relationship.  The film was presented at the Sundance Film Festival.  I think audiences want lovers to get together in the end.  Not having that happen makes the film seem like it's about lost opportunities and poor timing.  While it gives the film depth, it's not quite the happy ending we hope for in a romantic picture.  The performances here are deep and worth viewing.  Adams does a nice job of keeping the pacing brisk and making each supporting character seem to be multi-dimensional.  Enjoy!",1197849600,7,1816,5.228373702422146
1612995,2,B00005JPGI,"I had very high hopes for this movie.  It stars one of my favorite actresses, Ashley Judd, and it promised to be a return to form for her, her best performance to date, something to finally get her noticed by the academy maybe.  It's a shame that Judd is really the only redeeming factor in this film.  `Come Early Morning' suffers from being just too plain, nothing special indeed.  There really is no life to this movie other than Judd's impressive performance.  I think my wife summed it up best when she said ""she's a whore who had a bad life, end of story"" and that is really the case here.  In fact we never really even get a real glimpse into what made her life so incredibly bad other than she had a philandering father who she never really had a relationship with and the family around her seems to fight an awful lot.

The film, written and directed by actress Joey Lauren Adams (who is another one of those talented actresses who never seems to get a break in the right movie), revolves around Lucy Fowler.  She is afraid of rejection more than anything else and so she spends her nights with one stranger after another, drowning her sorrow and or pain in booze.  This is until she meets Cal Percell, a newbie to her town and a gentleman of sorts.  He wants to have a real relationship with Lucy and she seems to want the same with him, but her innate tendencies start to tear them apart before they really have a chance to begin.  She struggles to right things with her father, accompanying him to his new `holy roller' church and she continues to visit and help out her family the best way she can.  She's guided somewhat by her roommate Kim, a young girl who has very different views on love, life and dating.

The film fails to really go anywhere.  Its premise is one of promise but it never capitalizes on it.  I saw this playing on Lifetime the other night and I chuckled a little bit because that's what this movie feels like, a Lifetime movie.  The execution is a bit amateurish.  Sure, Lucy may be a character close to Lauren Adams heart but you'd think that she would have really wanted to flesh her out more then.  By the end of the film the audience is left not really caring what happens to Lucy because the film doesn't really give us a reason to.

But there is Ashley Judd, and the hype is not overdone.  She really turns out a stand up knock down drag out performance here, really embracing all that she's given despite the lack of real material.  She's completely believable and convincing in her execution.  I really want to see her embraced for her talent because she has so much of it.  Laura Prepon is wasted here as Kim, she really doesn't have much to work with and is kind of left to fall flat on her face.  Jeffrey Donovan is decent here but is overshadowed by Judd's magnificence.  In fact, the only actor that holds him own against Judd is Scott Wilson who plays her father.  The final confrontation between the two is his moment to really shine without even saying a word.  While I feel that the scene should have gone a little deeper his solemn silent performance was touching to say the least.

In the end I really can't say much more about the film.  It's not one I would ever recommend to anyone wanting to witness a good film, but if you're a fan of Judd and want to see her really sink her teeth into a performance then watch this for that reason and that reason only.",1191801600,4,3413,4.3475513428120065
1612996,1,B00005JPGI,"I recently watched this movie for one reason.. Jeffrey Donovan. I'm a recent fan because of Burn Notice on USA Network.  He was very good in this movie, very real and touching. Although Ashly Judd is a beautiful and extremely talented actress, this movie was a complete waste of time.  There were many lost opportunities for the story to take a better turn, such as the dog.  Why not then, after the dog died, get another dog and show that she has some feelings for something afterall.  The end is just horrible and I'm left with... is that all there is? Did she really change? Is she going to go back to her old ways?  Will she be able to keep the company afloat?  Did she make amends with her father? What about her grandparent?

Too may questions left unanswered.",1191024000,9,766,4.428571428571429

I came away from this movie feeling very little, mostly that I wasted 2 hours watching.  No inspiration, no thoughtful moments not even a just plan good entertainment.

Ashley Judd plays Lucy who has a lot of issues and instead of being productive and doing something, she goes and gets drunk and finds herself in bed with some guy she met at the bar the night before. she then meets this guy Cal played by Jeffery Donovan and he really likes her and he sees things could be good between them only if she had not gone back to her old way. see when lucy sees things going good she destories it by getting drunk.
