Met Dennis Franz....what a nice guy! Met the director also....he too was quite congenial. Saw Hoffman,but could not get too close to him...Not like the bear hug, and joking around I enjoyed with Dennis Franz! I liked the movie for perhaps sentimental reasons...and also the young male actor in it was quite good, as well as of course Hoffman, and Franz...but could have done without some elements that were ""overdone"" i.e. swearing. It is a pretty decent film on the whole. The three actors seemed to work very well together, and I noticed,enjoyed goofing around with each other off-set!",1138838400,,753,4.890625
1081383,4,6305812241,"This came and went with nary a peep back in '96, but it deserved more attention than it got. Adaptations of David Mamet's work are not for everyone, I realize, but at least in this case the playwright did the adapting himself. Hoffman is a treat as Teach, a small-time hood who is all talk and very little action. The entire film is essentially a three-person, one-set ensemble piece, but Hoffman, Dennis Franz, and the young Sean Nelson pull it off. Franz wisely chose to underplay his role as Donny, who listens semi-patiently to all of Teach's endless bluster, and Michael Corrente's direction is mostly successful in keeping the film from feeling too stagey.",1137542400,2,662,4.815789473684211

1081385,1,6305812241,"Since I have a lot of friends in the theatre business I'm always assailed by Mamet films (whether directed by him or just film adaptations of his plays) whenever I get together with them to watch a movie. Although there are a few Mamet films I enjoy, most of his film offerings are perfect examples of bourgeois cinema.
 The director of American Buffalo might as well have had the actors perform the movie on a stage and filmed it like he would a play; the movie felt like a play. Mamet's dialogue might work in the theatre but in the world of film it is contrived at best and seems designed so that the intelligentsia can pat themselves on the back by chortling at the right spots. A.B. is Mamet at his most pretentious and merely proves that lovers of the playwright will sit through his self-congratulatory ... and try to read an insight into his material in order to prove to themselves that they haven't been deceived--that good old David is some witty commentator on society.
  But he is not.  Mamet is merely the decadent mouthpiece of bourgeois society and American Buffalo, like most of his films, offer no real societal critique and are intelligent only in the way a first year philosophy student in love with Nietzsche is intelligent.  The man should stick to writing for the stage since theatre--the perfect medium for pretentious bourgeois art--is the last bastion for pretentious artists like Mamet.",1052265600,12,1413,4.727642276422764
1081386,5,6305812241,"To say that David Mamet has an ear for language and an eye for human interaction would be an injustice to this ingenious playwright/screen writer, for he transcends even the most astute observor.  Few stage plays adapted for the screen maintain their integrity, but ""American Buffalo"" is the exception.  The intensity of this movie is further heightened by the superior acting of both Hoffman and Franz.  Many an aspiring actor/playwright could benefit from viewing this outstanding film.",971481600,11,488,5.311688311688312
1081387,3,6305812241,"Three Stooges Plan a Heist
by Bruce Cantwell
You'd think that junk man Don (Dennis Franz ) knew what he was doing. You'd think he'd have a reason for putting neighborhood kid Bobby ( Sean Nelson ) on the tail of that guy: that uppity yuppy who bought the Buffalo-head nickel off Donny for ninety  bucks. More than book value! But you know something. He don't know nothin'!  Donny's such a stranger to good fortune that he can only conceive of one  reason a guy would come into his shop and plunk down decent dough for one  of his pieces of junk.
Well not this time, buddy.
Donny: There's  business and there's friendship, Bobby. There are many things, and when you  walk around you hear a lot of things, and what you got to do is keep clear  who your friends are, and who treated you like what, or else the rest is  garbage, because things are not always what they seem to be.
American  Buffalo is David Mamet 's comic valentine to the disenfranchised. As  clueless as the characters in Sexual Perversity in Chicago were about  women, his American Buffalo are about human nature in general.
They're  not illiterate, far from it. Teach's ( Dustin Hoffman ) transient hotel  room is filled with books. But you have to wonder how many are Elmore  Leonard novels and conspiracy theories about everything under the sun.  David Mamet has made these guys eloquent, the better to analyze how greatly  they exaggerate their importance. Listening to them, you'd think that the  world was created and all human history set into motion specifically to  screw old Don and Teach.
Teach: You got to trust your instincts, right or  wrong. . . It Is kickass or kissass, Don, and I'd be lying if I told you  any different.
Unlike the ill-fated real estate salesmen in Glengarry  Glen Ross , who are up against the external bogeymen of economic recession  and a corporate villain who's out to shave the staff, Don and Teach are  largely victims of their own dysfunctional insights.
Mamet examines how  tough life can be without trust, but one senses that the shaggy-dog story  of a pair of guys who would rather talk about going to a baseball game than  actually going is at the heart of this film. END",961200000,5,2183,4.576227390180879
1081388,4,6305812241,"The performances in this film keep it above the average fare. Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Franz, and Sean Nelson all give terrific performances in this character study of those at the bottom. Many complained that Hoffman  acted in a retread of Ratso rizzo, but I say Teach is a much different  character. It is a shame that, to paraphrase Entertainment Weekly, films  such as Pulp Fiction and Usual Suspects have softened the impact of the  language used in this film, but the words act as violence, gaining  intensity. Profane but also powerful. Mamet creates a brilliant view of the  world through these character's eyes. Michael Corrnete's direction attempts  to make it cinematic by allowing the action to breathe from the confined  stage settings, and mostly succeeds. (That is the reason why I give 4, not  5 stars) It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it is a fantastically acting  and engrossing story. Bonus: Thomas Newman's score is fantastic and  perfectly compliments the mood of the film.",924912000,6,995,4.96969696969697

1081461,4,6305812241,"As a writer, it's tempting to overload a story with lots of characters, action set pieces, and b-stories. This movie takes it back to basics and relies on good 'ol fashioned acting, character, and personality. The dialogue is crisp and you just want to hang out and listen to these guys all day.

1081463,5,6305812241,"David Mamet should have won the Pulitzer Prize for this play. He won it subsequently for Glengarry Glen Ross and I imagine that American Buffalo and the waves it made had to help. This adaptation, well, its great. It captures all the lovely moments in the play and allow Dustin Hoffman to tee-off as Teach. Such a great watch. Since getting the DVD, I've watched it all the way through 10 times and I will watch it many times to come. Buy and you won't be bummed.",1361145600,,463,4.333333333333333
1081464,1,6305812241,"Some of David Mamet's plays turn out awesome on screen: ""Sexual Perversity in Chicago,"" ""Glengary, Glenross"".  Others, like ""Oleanna"" and ""American Buffalo"" just drag on.  This probably is a great play to see live in a more intimate setting but on screen it is just painful to watch.

These are some of my favorite actors, and they have their moments.  Dennis Franz goes on a couple of good rants, like when he realizes he got ripped off.  But overall this is just too freaking dull.  Pick another film.",1314662400,4,503,4.659090909090909
1081465,5,6305812241,"Saw this on t.v. a while back. Had to have a copy.  I like the fact that it's like a play and doesn't include a lot of scene changes and characters.  In fact, you'll notice you hardly ever see anyone on the street when they're filming outside.  There are actually ""3"" characters.  BUT, even with so few characters it was one of those films I had to watch again to really follow the scheme that was going on.  Since ordering my own copy I've watched it over and over again.  It's interesting to read behind Dustin Hoffman's eyes and see the con man he is.  He knows when to push buttons and when to pull back.  Interesting movie.  Recommend everyone giving it a watch.",1293840000,,667,4.314516129032258
1081466,1,6305812241,"Yes, David Mamet is a fine playwright with an ear for crisp dialogue - Glengarry Glen Ross is a testament to that fact.
American Buffalo is something else.
Ninety minutes set almost completely in a junk shop with Franz and Hoffman bantering back and forth, does not make for interesting drama.
The movie goes nowhere.
I kept waiting for a payoff of some kind that never came.
Disappointing at best - worthless at worst.",1265673600,5,419,4.675675675675675
1081467,3,6305812241,"Although Dennis Franz and Dustin Hoffman are, in my opinion, great actors, the plot to this movie was a real piece of garbage, and I don't think Franz and Hoffman should ever have agreed to participating in it.",1215043200,4,210,4.552631578947368

7895828,4,6305812241,"As a cautious fan of Mamet's (he's a singularly thoughtful writer who occasionally misses his target), I often find myself defending his films to those who dismiss them as either pretentious or dull.  Yes, sometimes his narrative style is too deliberate for pop-cinema translation, yet not abstruse enough to be considered arthouse (e.g., 'Homicide,' 'House of Games,' 'Oleanna'-- all of which I like very much); and some of his movies simply aren't that well executed (e.g., 'Heist,' 'Spartan,' 'State and Main').  'American Buffalo' (Capitol Films, 1996), while arguably an example of the former situation, hits the bulls eye for those interested in character study and, more particularly, in the study of the American character.  Downbeat and dialogue-driven, it will likely weed out the ADHD audience not long after the opening credits, which is to say those looking for mind-bending plot twists or quick-cut action sequences need not apply.  But if you have an appreciation for top-notch acting and the patience to cull meaning from a fairly mundane series of events that, as they escalate, have great dramatic impact on three socially marginalized urbanites living lives of quiet desperation, 'American Buffalo' is a very rewarding watch.  4 stars.",1443484800,3,1254,5.345177664974619
7895829,4,6305812241,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There are some plays and movies that are not about sitting there for 90 minutes or more just watching something that makes you laugh or tense up due to the action involved. Instead they offer an actor the chance to use the skills they have developed to bring life to a character, good or bad, that makes that character come alive. To watch that isn't necessarily something you watch for pure entertainment. It becomes a combination of that and being pulled into the lives of the characters on screen. Those actors become those characters.

On top of that there are certain writers who can bring forth a story and screenplay (or play) that offers actors the chance to do just that. One of the most exciting of these is David Mamet. In numerous screenplays Mamet has provided actors with the opportunities to show just how great they can be. The language he chooses may offend but it is the language of the characters he is writing about. Its real.

In 1996 two actors performed in a movie based on one of Mamets hit plays, AMERICAN BUFFALO. Both of them displayed such amazing jobs of acting that you come to a point where you have a hard time differentiating between what is real, what is acting, and what is a movie that you are watching. Between the written word and the sculpting of the characters both bring life to what could have been boring.

Dennis Franz is Don, the owner of an inner city junk store and part time thief who has just learned of a possible big score. Having resigned himself to the daily grind of running this business he now has a chance to put something away, make a large haul for himself and for the person that tipped him off to the score, Bob (Sean Nelson). Having overheard a conversation at the nearby diner across the street, the two are making plans for this once in a lifetime deal.

Into the pawn shop walks Teach (Dustin Hoffman). Teach is a professional criminal by trade, a small timer who talks big and who thinks he knows it all. Where Don has resigned himself to the daily life he leads, Teach constantly makes plans to be the big man on the block. He recites rules that should apply to all criminals and yet follows none. He might talk about how a smart crook knows not to share information while at the same time pressuring those around him to talk. Such is the case as he pushes Dons buttons trying to find out just what hes planning, what the score is. While punching up how great he is he tells Don that Bob is too young and unskilled to be a part of this score.

Throughout the movie Don is on edge, wondering if they can pull off this burglary or not, wondering who he should trust, being manipulated by the fast talking and ever present Teach. He knows Bob is a young kid but is Teach someone he can actually trust? As the film moves forward the arguments back and forth, the discussions of what to do fill the 88 minutes were watching with a sense of dread and concern for all involved. They may be crooks but they are also human beings. We watch as they crumble before us and hope that in the end things will turn out all right.

The movie takes place in the junk store from start to finish with only a few moments with the characters stepping outside into the street taking place. It feels claustrophobic and tight matching the wordplay that goes on between the characters. What goes down between these three men in the course of one night makes for some tense moments and some fascinating back and forth dialogue that has you mesmerized from the start.

I remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and thinking how boring it was. But I was younger than and unappreciative of the display of skill that was taking place by the actors on the screen or the dexterity of the written words that Mamet had woven together to create these three characters and their world. Watching it now I wish I would have appreciated it more at the time and now look forward to watching it again.

This new blu-ray release from Twilight Time shows their care in the choices they make to bring to blu. Extras, as are normally the case with Twilight Time, are limited but good choices none the less. An isolated score track, commentary track featuring film historians Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailer are what is offered.",1441065600,,4350,4.461635220125786
