8358424,1,B0029X58A8,very disappointed with this dvd.  the moves and the music are not synchronised. she and the kids don't move to the music. frustrating when steps and music don't flow together. what's the point of having music then. also the superimposed backgrounds are quite an eyesore. judy howard's fit for kids is 1000 times better.,1264723200,,319,4.907407407407407
