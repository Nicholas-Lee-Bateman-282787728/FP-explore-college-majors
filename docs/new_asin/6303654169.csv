7852621,4,6303654169,"This has to be one of my favorite Lamb Chop videos.  The only reason I give it a four out of five instead of straight five, is because with the part where Mr. Wimperdink (the owner of Sunshine Studio, where all of this takes place) talks to Alan Thicke and John Byner right after Shari convinces Lamb Chop to go (she is scared stiff of going to what she thinks is a haunted studio) lags.  However, it does get saved by the catchy song that Thicke and Byner perform ""Becoming a Monster"" right before they are locked in by the phantom (who is really a lonely old man named Mr. Chekov.) who wants to be in the special himself.  This video still has that same quality that you expect from Shari Lewis, especially the jokes, and little Hush Puppy getting away from ""Dr. Frankenstein"" (the phantom acting as John Byner playing the role), but some kids might get frightened when little Lamb Chop is scared by Mr. Chekov and hurts her head.  But, the songs are wonderful, and I love the ending, especially Shari's tribute to her parents that is shown over the pictures of her getting dressed as a witch.  All in all, great video for Halloween, or anytime!",1313539200,2,1147,4.442857142857143
7852622,5,6303654169,"My family and I have watched this movie almost every Halloween since I was two years old.  I LOVE IT!!  It's just so adorable, as Lamb Chop says in the beginning, ""SS, for 'slightly scary', and ""FF, for 'family fun'""!  Also, it's written very well, touching and amusing both children and adults.  I'm apt to think that this movie teaches at least three lessons.  Kids learn that, when in an uncomfortable or boring situation, they can always use their imagination to improve it.  They also learn that there is a non-scary explanation behind all the spooky things they see at Halloween.  But, most important and poignantly, they learn not to judge someone by how they look and to have compassion.  'The Phantom' in the 'haunted studio' is really a lonely old man named Mr. Chekov who has a deformity to one side of his face.  He has lived in the studio for 30 years because no one, not even his family, will not accept him in the outside world (reminiscent of ""The Phantom of the Opera"").  Over the years, because he scared people, anyway, he began to have some fun at it, doing it on purpose for a laugh and gratification for the rejection he'd felt since childhood, hence creating the ""Phantom"" title.  The song that Mr. Chekov sings near the end of the movie is breathtaking and one of the many things that adults will appreciate, as are the subtle jokes throughout the show and Shari's song during the closing credits.  It's the perfect Halloween movie! :-D",1302134400,,1460,4.616279069767442
7852623,5,6303654169,"Lamb Chop in the Haunted Studio is by far the BEST movie of all time. I'm 12 and I still love Shari, Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy, and Charlie Horse. This is a fun movie about the whole gang filming a show at Sunshine Studios, home to all the great monster movies. Lamb Chop is scared stiff of the phantom, whom she is convinced is real, though Shari brushes it off and tells her there's no such thing. Little do they know...
This is a great slightly scary yet funny movie for the whole family to watch together.",1074556800,6,505,4.216494845360825
