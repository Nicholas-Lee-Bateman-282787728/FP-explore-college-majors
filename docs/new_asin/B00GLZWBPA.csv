8624388,5,B00GLZWBPA,"I bought this because I admired Stirling Silliphant's other great work (Route 66).  So far, I've watched about 25% of the set.  These are great stories; well-written, well-acted and realistic.  I had forgotten how depressing the 1950's were.  Everything seems so grimy, pathetic, and poverty stricken compared to today.  The show features a lot of open air shots, and you can literally see the smokestacks pollute the air.  Everything seems so worn out - the buildings, the streets, and the people.  Almost everybody smokes on this show (and drinks hard liquor).  Be prepared for lots of violence - especially gun violence.  People seemed much edgier and depressed then (no SSRIs or anti-anxiety drugs to mute the emotions).  Naked City lacks the ethereal quality of Route 66, although it does tackle moral issues and moral quandaries.  Although there is a regular cast of detectives, the focus is on the non-recurring characters.  In fact, I would say that the detective characters are basically props.  It's a shame Americans no longer have the patience or attention span for anthology drama series.  It's a lost form of entertainment.

Packaging was excellent; video and sound quite watchable.  Recommended!",1394841600,,1210,5.191709844559585
8624389,5,B00GLZWBPA,"One of the great series of the 1960s, The Naked City went for 190 hours and consisted of 138 B/W episodes on 29 dvds. It went for a short four seasons, but it was not your normal cop show as it delved into the very personal aspects of the victims. Each week you were treated to a police show that was all story filled with excitement, drama and emotion.

This series has it's own story within the eight million stories because of the stars and co-stars. The story starts with John McIntire, who lasted for a very short time, and James Franciscus, who lasted for a bit longer. When John McIntire was killed off Horace McMahon was the leader for a while, but came back as a co-star for the rest of the series.

Paul Burke took over from James Franciscus, and Nancy Malone joined the list later. Harry Bellaver was the only one who lasted the full distance in the roll of sargeant.

Anyway, they are joined by excellent guest stars who include: Gene Hackman, William Shatner, Carrol O'Connor, Jean Staplton, Jack Klugman, Peter Fonda, Alan Alda, Robert Duvall, Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Nielsen, Ed Asner, James Coburn, Rip Torn, George C. Scott, Vic Morrow, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, George Segal, Tom Bosley, Al Lewis, Peter Falk, and the list goes on.

Immerse yourself in some of the stories from the Naked City (New York), a five star cop show that ended all others, and is as vibrant today as it was fifty years ago. So grab a copy and enjoy a show that came to you live from the very streets of a city that DID sleep in certain parts.

There are eight million stories in ""The Naked City"". This, has not been one of them.",1390089600,,1626,4.461279461279461
