8293095,5,B001DER2JO,"I'm a huge fan of Mythbusters, and I own all the seasons.  Sadly, many of the specials were left out of the season boxsets (although strangely some were also included).  Mythbusters Shop Til You Drop special was one that isn't included in the boxsets, so I had to buy it separately.  Man, it was worth it!

The special is just what it sounds like, it covers all the shopping that the Mythbusters do.  It tells you where they buy ridiculous quantities of things like Christmas lights cheaply, where they manage to buy pigs that died of natural causes, and the junkyards where you can buy strange tanks and parts of planes.  I found all of that very interesting, plus the whole thing is told with Jamie and Adam's trademark humor throughout.  Aside from that, they delve into the backstory behind the famous scene where Adam gets his lips sucked into a vacuum, they show where Jamie gets his berets, they explain where to buy ballistics gel and how to use it, and they even show the inside of Adam's house, which is something I don't think has ever been seen on another Mythbusters episode.  This special is just chock full of interesting little tidbits like that for any hardcore fan of the Mythbusters.

As for the DVD release itself, it's just a no-frills release that comes with the episode (which is about 50 minutes long) and nothing else.  Well, there is a commercial for random Discovery Channel shows, but that's it.  Still, it's a solid release, it plays correctly and has no problems, so I can't complain much.  I highly recommend this release to any fan of Mythbusters, especially someone trying to get all the episodes for their collection.",1356912000,,1651,4.674740484429066
