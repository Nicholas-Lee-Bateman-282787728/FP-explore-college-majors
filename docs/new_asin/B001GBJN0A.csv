8304760,5,B001GBJN0A,"Growing up isn't easy at all, and these 'scapegoats' show you how they managed to survive high school, all being documented by a fellow student. Featuring members from Mika Miko, No Age and Lavender Diamond, as well as the appearance of Mike Watt, High School Record works as the 'awkward documentary' of an awkward stage of everybody's life.",1367020800,,342,4.913793103448276
8304761,1,B001GBJN0A,"Can't really say much else about this movie. I thought that the five star rating was too good to be true..well I was right. Dull, slow, and witless humor. I couldn't even make through the entire movie. Very misleading five star ratings and reviews. Wish I could get a refund..",1358553600,,276,4.54

8304764,5,B001GBJN0A,"Great movie.  Chock full of people who made the Smell a scene, portraying the most fun awkward moments of being a kid.",1251936000,,118,4.363636363636363
8304765,5,B001GBJN0A,"I was excited to see this was for sale after only seeing a few chopped up bits of the film on youtube. I don't know if i can try to describe the film, except maybe to say it's like a funnier napoleon dynamite. Becky Stark is awesome as a character that i can only hope is not too far from herself...except for the illegal thing. and i can honestly say i loved all the characters. i have no idea why i love it, but i think it's best not to over-analyze this film's appeal. all i know is that i laughed for practically the entire film....when i wasn't pausing for the too real truths that are hidden here. and for a low budget film i'm kinda digging some of the cool shots. i'll have to go back to study those later. i would recommend this to anyone who ever felt like they didn't fit in, didn't want to fit in, or anyone who's ever been a human.",1222819200,5,844,4.059880239520958
