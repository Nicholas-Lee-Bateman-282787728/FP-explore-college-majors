8116619,4,B000F2YXEW,"My discovery of the rather ""obscure"" (I believe, except in Sweden where he is probably a ""household word"") STIG OLIN last night just about left me HAUNTED....
A fascinating ""man-of-a-thousand-faces"", Olin appears in this film as an ageless man who photographs exquisitely and one moment he is 20------and then he is, what?----50, perhaps (he was 29, actually.) The character is that of a MAGNIFICENTLY NEUROTIC man who wants to ""believe"" but is too bright to accept life in all its hypocrisy and masquerades. What I saw (and you must see perhaps three or four times to, especially, grasp the beauty of the philosophy he ""precariously"" seems to espouse in some long takes)is a man trying to hold on to life, yet always about to descend into chaos. He is morbidly complex------ cruel, foolish, a liar at times, unforgettably tender, intellectually a ""talking"" book (and this is where the film almost falls precariously into melodrama) offering us all these amazingly profound ""soliloquies""------yes, he has much of HAMLET in him......A ""poor man's Hamlet"" indeed. He can be beautifully joyous, a little lost child for all of us to protect, a lost soul barely able to function------but also, a horribly self-absorbed person who you never come to actually trust on  whether he CARES for anyone but himself.
A violinist, he suffers a terrible episode when, because of the promise he shows is given a principal role in a major work, by the director of the orchestra (the same old man from ""Wild Strawberries"", a few years before---1949) and makes a mess of it. The possibility of a soloist career appears over, and the pain is overwhelming. He marries, has twins, poverty is ever-present throughout, and his wife, played quite beautifully by an actress new to me as well, Maj-Britt Nilsson, suffers quietly while he takes on a vixen lover/whore (a total surprise that comes unexpectedly) and in a confrontation even ends up striking the wife again and again, the poor woman unable to reconcile her love for him and the family they have ""built"" with what she always ""knew"" would materialize. They go back and forth as the children grow, she spending long periods away from him.
There are quite a bit of rough edges in ""To Joy"", a certain.......amateurish quality to the film-------indeed, a glaring one being that the movie opens in the ""present"" (another tragedy befalling our ""hero"") and then the whole film takes place in the past, but Bergman unfortunately does not go back to the ""present"" and puts it all aside, apparently because he could not find enough of a reason to take us back (I see no other answer, but this is Bergman) leaving more than a certain taste of Sentimentality in the ending-------although beautiful in itself.
This actor played, I believe, in several other early Bergman films, and I look forward to every one of his performances.
Arguably a ""lesser"" Bergman, and yet even his less than excellent material shines brightly (in this case) because of what turns out to be an unforgettable character study.......Mr. OLIN chews up the screen and leaves no space for just about anything, anyone else.",1383264000,,3114,4.954110898661568
8116620,4,B000F2YXEW,"captures the deep thoughts and feelings beyond surface appearances in ways that few films ever had in 1950.  Even as a very young director, he seems intimately aware of the creative personality type who recognizes and craves greatness, but is not quite able to attain it.  The old orchestra conductor has found a way to channel this frustration into a work ethic.  The young violinist at the center of this story is not quite so wise.  The urgent music often parallels the inner struggle onscreen.",1359331200,,497,4.811764705882353
8116621,4,B000F2YXEW,"Somewhat one-sided and sometimes melodramatic portrait of a doomed
marriage, this still has it share of lovely moments, not least of which
is the on-screen performance of great classical music by the orchestra
that both protagonists are part of.

While their romance starts sweetly, Stig rapidly turns into a hateful
character, his failure to reach stardom as a solo musician translated
into taking out his frustrations on his sweet wife, and coldly having
an affair to counter his feelings of impotence and self-loathing.

While an interesting portrait of an artist's own ambition standing in
the way of being better at their craft (it's Stig's need for approval
and outward success that doesn't allow him to really thrown himself,
body and soul into his music - or his marriage), Marta his wife just
comes off as too perfect a martyr.

There are moments where the acting is very strong, and some of the
photography is lovely, but the film just feels a bit like the character
of Stig - too self-conscious and too sure about who is right and wrong.
Still, there are lots of hints of Bergman's genius to come, and it's
well worth seeing for those.

Another nice transfer by Tartan.",1333843200,,1180,4.826732673267327
8116622,3,B000F2YXEW,"""To Joy,"" released in 1950, isn't a very good film, although it does have its moments.  It was Bergman's eighth film, and he was still learning his trade as both a director and a writer.  But there are indications of the impending explosion of his genius in 1953 with Summer with ""Summer with Monika"" and ""Sawdust and Tinsel.""

The film reminds one of Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" in its treatment of the difficulty of living with artistic mediocrity.  Stip is a violinist in a small orchestra who aspires to be a famous soloist.  But he just doesn't have what it takes--his one and only solo performance ends disastrously--and his frustration, rage, and self-loathing nearly destroy him and alienates everyone who loves him.  His long-suffering wife Marta doesn't crave fame.  All she wants, she tells Stig, is honesty in life.  The main thing is ""to become a real person.""  Stig is disdainful of this ""small"" purpose, but at last comes to his senses after nearly losing Marta and their two children.  He learns, as Salieri in Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" never did, that small joys and little meanings are rewarding and, ultimately the best we can hope for.  The end of the film ends with Marta's accidental death--yet another failure--but one that Stig, having learned to accept the small joys one has instead of lamenting what can't be, responds to it differently than he did to the death of his professional hopes.

Maj-Britt Nilsson puts in a good performance as Marta, and Victor Sjostrom, who will just a few years later star in ""Wild Strawberries,"" plays well as Sonderby, the orchestra conductor.  But Stig Eriksson's performance of Stig is uneven.  Erland Josephson has a small speaking role as a drunk at a party, and observant viewers will spot Ingmar Bergman in one scene as a man in a maternity ward waiting room.",1220313600,4,1816,4.853896103896104
