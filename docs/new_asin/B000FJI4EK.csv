I bought this as a gift for my son who is still a huge Pokemon fan.  He loves it and watches the DVDs by himself or with his friends.  My review is simply based on my son's joy, so for the Pokemon fans out there . . . a great buy!",1242777600,,408,5.766666666666667

8123572,5,B000FJI4EK,"To pick up where Volume One of ""Pokemon Advanced"" left off, Pokemon fans are once again treated to another fantastic collection of episodes for this second Volume of ""Pokemon Advanced!"" More great fun, adventure, and humor. :)

Here are some of my favorite moments from each episode:

""Which Wurmple's Which?:"" Jessie's remark, as she argues with May over their Wurmples, is a scream: ""My Wurmple's attending night school to get its Phd!"" :) The visual of Team Rocket's boss sewing a button on his pajamas is far fetched! The fishing scene is amusing with interesting Pokemon cameos.

""A Hole Lotta Trouble:"" Love the visual gag of each of the characters' faces tumbling down the different tunnels! The scene featuring Meowth's ""Way too long"" story was one of my favorites in the episode! I get a kick out of when he asks out loud, ""Who's Steven?"" :)

""Gone Corphishin':"" Some mighty ""Tug-of-War"" scenes, here! Team Rocket's seaweed disguises are hilarious! Ash's reaction is great: ""The Twerps?"" :) Impressive battle near the end of the episode. Treecko is in top form!

""A Corphish Out of Water:"" Love the special effects during the Team Rocket motto! Jessie's remark on the tape recorder is a riot: ""Oh, quit sniveling!"" Hilarious shot of Brock holding hands with Nurse Joy at the end of the episode! :)

""A Mudkip Mission:"" Silly dialog among Team Rocket as they discover the fence: ""What's it doing here?"" Funny shot of Jessie's ear growing as she listens to ""Swampy's"" info! Even funnier is the fact that ""Old Man Swamp"" inadvertently gives Team Rocket advice about breaking the dam!

""Turning Over A Nuzleaf!:"" The ""Loudred"" scenes were hilarious! A shame that subtitles weren't featured during the Pokemon-only scenes, since the ""Island of the Giant Pokmon"" episode, from Season One, featured them ... That way, viewers could understand what the Pokemon were saying. Great Pokemon teamwork, though. :)

""A Three Team Scheme:"" Teams Aqua and Magma appear to be the most dangerous villains in the Pokemon series, compared to Team Rocket! Real serious talk between the two teams! ""Power they seek?!"" :) The more we get to know Commander Isabel/Shelly, she makes Jessie look nice!

""Seeing is Believing:"" Hilarious remarks from Team Rocket referring to Professor Birch's bonding with the Pokemon as ""some sort of new dance!"" James and Meowth's efforts to tell Jessie the truth about her Pokemon are classic! :)

""Ready, Willing and Sableye:"" When Max mentions Team Rocket to Sableye, you have to wonder if and how Sableye actually knows who the villains are! Sableye looks like he got a bad headache after listening to the advice of May and Max!

""A Meditite Fight:"" The ""field of holes"" scheme and the ever-changing attitude of Team Rocket in the cave scenes were amusing! Shauna getting drenched by the wave in the beginning was pretty funny too! An awkward intro for her!

""Just One of The Geysers:"" Love the Team Rocket Motto, including ""The Four Food Groups!"" Amusing how Team Rocket has a dream of raiding the refrigerator, then after the villains wake up, they find that the dream came true! Awesome rematch for Ash with Geysers included!

""Abandon Ship!:"" Awesome to see all three stages of Mudkip in a single episode! Jessie's reaction, before she is captured, is hilarious! Also funny to see the prisoners colliding into one another whilst dangling from the webs. :)

""Now That's Flower Power:"" Drew is like the next Gary Oak! Nice of him to pitch in while the heroes take on Team Rocket. :) Check out the scene where Team Rocket does their impression of Wobbuffet! Awesome display of fireworks! :)

""Having A Wailord Of A Time:"" Check out Brock's flashback ... Great bit of history! That's one tough Torchic! Ash's excuse towards the little girl, in regard to Torchic, is hysterical: ""They smell like something you left in the fridge too long!"" :)

""Win, Lose or Drew!:"" Hilarious scenes featuring the old man telling Team Rocket about Pokblock! Amusing scene showing a nervous May backstage before the contest! Nice scenes with Ash, Brock, and Max showing May tons of support. :)

""The Spheal of Approval:"" Humorous ""slapstick"" scene with Marius and Spheal attempting to battle Ash and Pikachu. Team Rocket's comments are classic ... James: ""We'll surely be rolling in green stuff!"" Meowth: ""And we'd make lots of money too!"" Ash and friends look like Wobbuffet when they get ""brain freeze!"" :)

""Jump for Joy!:"" More hilarious dialogue from Team Rocket ... James: ""Next thing you know they'll be copying our uniforms!"" Meowth: ""They won't copy mine!"" The scene featuring Brock traveling with Shiftree was a scream ... Literally! Also, check out the hilarious visual gag showing Brock with heart-shaped eyes and mouth when he exclaims, ""Nurse Joy! Then that means ... I'm actually here in Nurse Joy's room!"" :)

""A Different Kind of Misty:"" The title of this episode is misleading, because I was hoping the episode would feature the return of Misty! Fortunately, she makes a return for a couple of episodes, a little into the next Season. :) ""Helping Hand"" really gets the job done! May and Max's reaction to being labeled as ""followers"" is classic!

""A Pok-BLOCK Party:"" The heroes got rusty when it came to avoiding Jigglypuff's song, this time around! Team Rocket's ""double-disguises"" are amusing! I busted out laughing when The Trick Master both fell off the log and hit the wall! :)

""Watt's With Wattson?:"" Wattson seemed like a villain at first, because of his crazy laugh! His assistant, Watt, has a voice similar to Meowth! Amazing that the heroes survived the ""ride"" into the gym, considering it had no seat-belts! What a way to welcome challengers to Wattson's gym!

*Before I close, I wanted to add that I never tire of listening to Meowth's hilarious ""made up"" scenarios about Giovanni rewarding Team Rocket for bringing him different kinds of Pokemon! I get a kick out of the predicaments Meowth imagines ""The Boss"" to be in, relying on a certain Pokemon to provide a solution for him! :)

Fantastic job to everyone who contributed in making the Pokemon episodes and the DVD sets! :) Thanks for reading! God Bless...

8123573,4,B000FJI4EK,"This Pokmon DVD box set contains 20 episodes of the ""Pokmon Advanced"" season (season 6) - half of the season's episodes.

 For the price this DVD is good value, although there are no significant extras or features to speak of.

 However, for those who are fans of the series, this product is probably a must, and enables them to obtain half of a season very easily (especially in comparison to the first season and the ""Johto Journeys"" season, where each DVD had only three episodes, making it very difficult to collect a complete season).

 This style follows on from the ""Master Quest"" season, but has yet to be repeated for the ""Advanced Challenge"" or ""Advanced Battle"" seasons.

 Overall, a good value purchase, even more so for fans of the franchise.",1175040000,6,755,4.753846153846154
