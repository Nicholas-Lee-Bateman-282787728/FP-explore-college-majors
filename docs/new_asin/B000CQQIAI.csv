8100712,5,B000CQQIAI,"At first i was a little turned off by the show when i first started watching it because of all the fan boy service.  But then it gets really good and the last disc was my favorite, very action packed and entertaining.  And on the box cover the clothes that the characters are wearing are the clothes that the voice actresses who played them are wearing in one of the extras featured on the disc.  I didn't realize that until i clicked to review this and i was like... i recognize that shirt.... Whoa... Pretty neat.
  Overall Great series and i hope i can get a hold of the OVA somehow cuz when this show ended i was sad... i wanted more because it is such a good show, and the Admiral (Alice) is one of my favorite characters!",1246492800,3,727,4.201438848920863
8100713,5,B000CQQIAI,"For music there is ""easy listening"" and this show is the equivalent for Anime -- it's ""easy watching"". The creators did a really great job at making an interesting character and plot driven story that somehow manages to maintain a laid back, relaxing feel to the presentation of it.

The premise in the story is that Earth is being bombarded by tons and tons of comets and meteors. This was predicted a few decades back so a system was put in place to deal with it. It evolved into an outer space defense force that gets all the glory and acts as the first line of defense and ground based units that provide cleanup. The ground based units actually use fast-launching high-altitude jets and the story revolves around a unit of four girls training to pilot these jets.

Mikaze is arguably the main character and early on the story focus on her lackluster performance as she ponders why she is there. There are mishaps, etc. along the way and eventually some intrigue, conspiracies, and action at the end.

The series will likely *not* appeal to the teenage boy market but it will likely appeal to girls and the adult male and female markets.",1215734400,2,1141,4.610837438423645
8100714,2,B000CQQIAI,Its basically a girls anime.  I bought it and i just thought it was too happy and light hearted.  No action really.  If your a guy you won't like it.  Girls would enjoy this though.  I sold it right back on amazon.,1188259200,,214,4.0
8100715,5,B000CQQIAI,"While it might not be one of the classics of anime, ""Stratos 4"" is a very well made and written series that is certainly worth the very low price for the collection.  Clearly more thought went into this than the girl-mecha-pilots-save-the-world average.  A very life-positive theme is part of the plot of the series, which certainly fits the peppy stars and the brain-sticking music.

And don't miss the extras.  Each disk has a couple minute ""interview"" with a serious fellow that offers musings both factual and bizzare on the air and spacecraft in the series.",1143763200,15,562,4.88421052631579
