6281790,3,B00IMQZU2C,"On the bright side, this is a wonderful collection, 20 discs in 8 different cases.  The episodes are sharp.  The sound is perfect.  It is simply a fascinating piece of television and scuba-diving history, featuring Lloyd Bridges, a true gentleman.

Unfortunately, Disc 2 has two episodes which froze at about the 10-minute mark.  I inspected the disc and found several circular scratches.  Now, I was in a quandary.  Do I try to watch the remaining 140 episodes within the next month and note how many more defects there might be, or simply send the collection back?  I wish I could've just returned the one defective disc, but Amazon didn't give me a choice or a way to contact a representative.

Without defects, I would've unquestionably given this collection 5 STARS.  Pity.

At a later date, I will re-order this same collection (I'll give them time to straighten it out).  Sea Hunt is worth the aggravation!",1401667200,23,913,4.819354838709677

Lloyd Bridges is one of the great TV and movies stars from those decades.  His character's integrity as a person who goes beyond the call of duty to help people is something we don't see very much anymore.",1486684800,3,348,4.028985507246377

6281808,5,B00IMQZU2C,"Ignore the negative reviews of this product.  Here is what I got.  Factory grade duel layer DVDs.  A couple of scratches because one of the DVDs came loose in it's case.  This is a bit common when shipping DVDs or CDs.  This here is a GREAT deal for Sea Hunt fans.  I am viewing episodes I have NEVER seen.  The price is is impossible to argue with, a great buy.  DVD tips:  Repair scratched optical discs using RainX.  Buff the chemical into the disc laterally from the circle. Let dry to a haze, then buff out using a very soft cloth laterally from the circle , or use an optical disc buffer.  As for dye type DVD's or any other recorded media storage item, storage conditions are the key to long term keeping of these items without age damage.  I have dye type CDs I have made 16 years ago that still play flawlessly. No rot or other problems.  A well cared for optical disc will exceed listed storage life.

The only problem I encountered is a missing episode.  So this IS NOT the complete series.  Episode 33, ""The Roustabout:, is not included in the set.",1452816000,11,1060,4.331632653061225

6281819,5,B00IMQZU2C,If you are like me and grew up in the 60s you are very familiar with this TV series. I think it made me and all of my friends want to take up scuba diving. This was bought for my husband who did became a scuba diver because of Mike Nelson's adventures! I will admit that the series is a bit dated but we still have had a lot of fun watching these again!,1415318400,,353,3.7837837837837838

6281821,5,B00IMQZU2C,I have the older boxed complete series set. Actually 2 sets because of alot of discs had gunk or scratches on them.  I cleaned gunk with computer eye glass cleaner. I'll be buying new set soon. I had recommended to Amazon and Turner Classic Movies that they should make better copies of this series with extra goodies interviews with cast and guest actors like Leonard Nimoy and even Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges.. I'll update when I get new set. I hope the locking mechanism that holds the DVD in place is of higher quality than the old set,1414540800,2,542,4.474747474747475

6281824,4,B00IMQZU2C,"Viewed the first season. No problems yet with disc. I watched the show as a kid and recently started diving. Hence the renewed interest.  The show, as most of the era is simplistic but I enjoy watching. Not a fan of TV today.",1413244800,,225,4.232558139534884
6281825,3,B00IMQZU2C,"If I was reviewing one of the pressed discs, I'd give the show and the set five stars - the show itself is excellent.  But this is a warning -- Amazon is apparently selling ""made on demand"" burned discs of this show, and they're even charging more for them!  Look carefully and buy the individual TGG Direct seasons instead of this package deal.  Those will be on pressed discs, which will give you a lot less trouble and have a much longer shelf-life than made-on-demand burned discs.

Made-on-demand DVD-Rs use dye-based DVDs, like you record on at home.  This is a VASTLY inferior media because the dye fades and is more prone to scratching, so you should always get pressed (silver) discs if that's an option.  Pressed discs can last decades, while DVD-R's often start having malfunctions and disc-rot within three or four years.  If you're buying these shows, it's because you want to collect them... so, make sure you know what you're buying and get the best media available.  Read the info carefully and avoid DVD-R's, you'll be much happier.",1413244800,62,1049,4.7569060773480665

6281829,5,B00IMQZU2C,"This series is amazing! Good old classic TV; exciting, heartfelt storytelling, and informative! Boyfriend saw an episode late one night and was instantly hooked--so of course we had to have all the seasons!  Lloyd Bridges is a class act, really gets into the role (and you even get to see young Jeff in an episode or two.)
Items arrived packaged nicely but appeared to be burned CD-Rs and one was scratched, rendering an episode unwatchable. Too bad no blu-ray. Almost want to buy a second set in case they wear out!",1409011200,7,516,4.670329670329671

6281831,1,B00IMQZU2C,"Great TV series: but bad DVR (scratches)
The issue is on the the packaging of the triple disks sets,
there was rubble in many of the cases, and the disks were scratched.
We tried 3 times with 3 different sets, and they all had scratches.
Amazon is great for the returns, but we could not get a set without the scratches.

hope this helps with your purchase",1408406400,15,356,4.313432835820896

8643429,5,B00IMQZU2C,"This is an awesome package if you are a SEA HUNT fan like myself! These are just a treasure to watch & Lloyd Bridges is spectacular as MIKE NELSON! I could not stop watching these, one disk after another, almost non stop until I watched through them all & now I'm watching them again. This is when TV was as good as it gets. Great scripts, acting and under water production with Courtney Brown as stunt double diver, Lamar Boren & Ricou Browning, who was the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, adding all their underwater production expertise and IVAN TORS producing! . Leonard Nimoy, Bruce Dern, Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, Robert Clarke, Larry Hagman, Larry Pennell, Ken Curtis (these two last actors later of Ripcord fame), Jack Nicholson (seen in the last episode of this series), and Bridges' own sons, Beau and Jeff are all in some of the episodes to add to your viewing pleasure! Lots of pretty gals in swimsuits show up as well,  including Connie Hines (MISTER ED) and Sue Randall (LEAVE IT TO BEAVER) to add some nice ""eye candy"". As Mike warns in the end of many episodes that skin diving is a great sport, but can be dangerous, you will certainly not be in any danger watching these. Get out your scuba gear & potato chips and watch till you get ""the bends"" or ""rapture of the deep"". Re-compression tank may be necessary.... HA! HA! Check out the episode where Mike watches his favorite TV show... ""DEMPSEY OF THE DEEP!"" It doesn't get any better than this. Disks & picture are great quality and all in a nicely put together package... ENJOY!!!",1521244800,,1552,4.58273381294964
