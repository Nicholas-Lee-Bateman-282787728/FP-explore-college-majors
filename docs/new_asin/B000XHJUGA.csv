8228387,5,B000XHJUGA,"Sadly a ""BEST BUY"" edition misleadingly put together to do what the ""BEST BUY"" store chain does best, fleece the consumer! Don't trust the ultra rare out of production, never to return (for copyright suit from a sax player on a studio outtake)  ""Martin Scorsese on Blues"" cover art. You won't get what you expect! Upon opening you will find the ""BEST BUY"" store logo on the disc & when played, the menu shows the multi colored cameo Hendrix blues ""official Hendrix Experience family approved"" art. When played it's as the menu art confirms. Just buy the real thing, not this hodgepodge DVD. I now have two identically (when played) dvd's. A regretfull misleading purchase thanks to ""BEST BUYS"" anything for a buck policy (by the way their electronics are poorly manufactured third world versions with a short shelf life). Very disappointing!",1438300800,,841,4.922535211267606

Jimi's love for the blues and roots in the famed R&B 'chitlin circuit' are explored alongside excerpts of legendary performances of his blues classics ""Red House"" and ""Hear My Train A Comin""",1431561600,,398,5.540983606557377
8228389,2,B000XHJUGA,"This DVD documentary from Experience Hendrix runs just under 16 minutes.  Punctuated with brief clips of Hendrix in concert and brief comments from varies blues luminaries, this documentary is far too short to have any impact or meaning.  Save your money.  This is just another rude exploitation of Jimi's greatness, not a tribute to it.  Has Janie Hendrix no shame?",1284422400,5,366,5.05
