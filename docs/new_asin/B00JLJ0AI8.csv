6381250,4,B00JLJ0AI8,"A pro-Catholic, pro-central European propaganda film.
Point of view: Jihad is nothing new, watchout for those Moslem traitors in your country. The French are turncoats.

I agree that this movie has too many tangential story lines. The story is told from a northern Italian and Polish point of view. Since this history is mainly unknown to Americans, more explaination of who these people were was needed for a version released in the US. The main women characters are mainly unhistorical and unnecessary.
If anything this movie is too pro-Islamic as it omits the fact that the Turkish Grand Vizir ordered all of those Christian women hostages in the pen killed after his troops had raped them.
The movie spends too much time on the Italian Saint and Turkish Grand Vizer, and too little time on how the Polish army happened to be there. King Jan III Sobieski of Poland had signed a mutual assistance treaty with the German Emperor, which the Polish King honored.
Depictions of the German Emperor as a coward who flees to the Alps, and Louis XIV of France as traitor to Christian Europe are spot on. No wonder the French and German critics panned this movie. It is not mentioned that this Turkish attack on central Europe started a 16 year crusade by the Catholic Holy League in which the Turks were driven from central Europe. The Eugene of Savoy character won this crusade in 1699 at Zenta, then united with the English and Dutch and defeated that French traitor, Louis XIV, from 1700-1708.

Too much money was spent on costumes and sets, and too little on computer generation and gunpowder weapons.  I noticed that most of the cannons don't recoil when fired, and that the Turkish trenches were dug with a modern ditching backhoe. A better movie could have been made, but the budget was obviously for television.

But the charge down the Kalenberg of the Polish Winged Hussars, skewering the Turks on their lances, near end of the movie, is the best part and well worth your $10, (so scene skip forward to it first).

The Turkish Grand Vizer is strangled on the Sultan's orders in the last scene, but he predicts that the Turks will return to western Europe, (and they have). That Islamic desire to turn St. Peters in Rome into a mosque has recently been repeated by the Islamic State in Syria and other modern jihadi groups.

So time for a new crusade, Christians?",1407801600,39,2366,4.716707021791768
6381251,4,B00JLJ0AI8,"I have mixed reactions to this. Gorgeous scenery and photography, important history, but a terrible lukewarm mess of a script, and very sloppy editing.

This depicts a crucial turning point in world history in which the centuries-long Muslim war of conquest against Western Civilization was stopped by Europe's defenders literally outside the Gates of the city of Vienna in 1683. If the Muslim jihadi's had won, I'd be typing this in Arabic--assuming that electricity and our free-speech Internet were still invented without Western Civilization to make them possible.

The Muslim's overwhelming onslaught were stopped by a relative handful of defenders, including an extraordinary real life King of Poland...who triumphed despite being outnumbered 6 to 1 by an enemy who had already invaded and slaughtered most of Eastern Europe in their wake.

That's an era and a conflict that many Americans are completely unfamiliar with, although Europeans are much better educated on their own history.

So there's an entire world of fascinating, true, genuinely world-shaking historic drama here.
There's no need to 'jump the shark' by inventing unnecessary and irrelevant fictional characters who never existed-- yet that's what the script and the director have chosen to focus on here, and that's a huge and jarring mistake. It takes a potentially great Epic and reduces it into just another fantasy-Game Of Thrones swords-and-beards soap opera. Film School 101 stuff.

The script invents this fictional Muslim peasant character in rural Italy and his fictional deaf-mute wife (???!!!) and gives their uninteresting, inarticulate peasant characters what feels like more script pages and more screen time than all of the main historic lead characters combined. Much of the film is devoted to following this irrelevant twosome around and injecting them artificially into scenes where they don't belong (because they never existed, and if they had they'd never have been players involved in 'Great Moments In History'). Aargh.

This invented-fictional-character shtick becomes a bizarre hijacking of the actual narrative. It's like choosing to tell the story of the Battle of Gettysburg by creating a Random Fictional Character of an illiterate farm hand (and his wife) who FOR NO REASON keeps encountering President Lincoln, and Robert E Lee, and Mark Twain, and then this Totally Fictional Character teaches Grant and Sherman the latest military tactics, and saves Lincoln from blow-dart assassination from an also-fictional team of lady-Samurai assassins in giant aerial hydrogen balloons sent by the Emperor of Japan, and then this Fictional Character must carry an urgent secret message from Lincoln to Queen Victoria in London, where he and his wife help Madame Curie discover the X-ray, and he rescues Frederick Douglass and Charles Darwin from Freemason kidnappers, and then helps Sherlock catch Jack The Ripper, and gives a young H.G.Wells the ideas for all his future novels, and--well, you get the picture.

It's puzzling to sit through this the first time, waiting for the purpose of this unbelievably pointless secondary narrative to (never) make plot sense. The second watching, it's ""What were they thinking?""

So this irrelevant side plot with this nonexistent fictional villager nonentity couple sucks a lot of the oxygen out of the actual historic events -- that are never shown or explained, because the scriptwriter is obsessed with following this fictional nonentity character and contriving the plot to insert him inexplicably into every single scene.
Sigh.

This could have been a truly epic film. I like F. Murray Abraham, he's always worth watching in any role. But here he seems tired and resigned and sad about every scene, as if he realizes his agent has committed him to a B project.

Watch it (for free) because there's not much else filmed (in English) about these events. No need to own it-- this is not an endlessly re-watchable film-- too much time wasted on the pointless fictional villager and his equally fictional marriage problems. It's also sloppily edited--the Big Climactic Battle Scene consists mostly of the same two stuntmen taking the same exact falls from six simultaneous camera angles. In slow-mo. Over and over.

Meh. 4 stars for charity, because I like F.M.Abraham and because this era in history is truly fascinating. This important Era deserves a film worthy of the effort.

Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, everybody.",1407801600,89,4465,5.308781869688385

6381274,5,B00JLJ0AI8,"The largest oil painting I have ever seen (I'm guessing it could be the largest in the world?) is one you will see on a tour of the Vatican, en route to everyone's 'final destination'  the Sistine Chapel. ""The Battle of Vienna -- September 11, 1683.""

Filling an entire high ceiling wall, the painting depicts Poland's greatest King (and army general) Jan Sobieski, as he and his comparatively small army (numbering in the tens of thousands) make final preparations  before going out to do battle against overwhelming odds  a Turkish army numbering nearly a third of a million men, outside the gates of Vienna.

That auspicious date in European history --- September 11th 1683  marked the last attempt by Islamic armies to conquer the capitols of Europe. (Rome and Paris were the next, had Vienna fallen.)

---

Every now and then I'm guided (if I didn't know better I'd say 'by coincidence') to find a great movie that never made it into theaters; this is such a film  a gripping, depiction (with terrific use of computer graphics) about the days leading up to the 'original 9-11'  of 333 years ago (the reason why suicide bombers picked September 11th).

On that date in 1683, the conquering armies of Islam, over 300,000 strong, were met, and held, and thrown back at the gates of Vienna by a much smaller army of Catholic soldiers led by a Polish king who -- in addition to having a great battle plan (hauling artillery at night, up steep hillsides shrouded in deep woods, in order to fire his big guns, with devastating impact, from a high hilltop) led his troops first in prayer to ""Jesus and his mother Mary.""

Not incidentally (as he would tell his people later) 'Good King Jan' brought with him from home a life-size replica of The Black Madonna painting (at Poland's most important shrine, Our Lady of Chestachova). And again, at the heart of this film  the battle outcome is further assured (Catholics would say) with prayers from an Italian priest and saint, Father Marco d'Aviano; he was there at the walls of Vienna reminding the Catholic soldiers of what was at stake: Our wives, our children, and most importantly -- the future of our Faith!

It's a terrific movie that sticks to logistical facts surrounding this one, all-important day in history  so pivotal to the future of Europe. The film opens with the voice of a great narrator, speaking these few words (as a telescopic view of a full moon is shrouded in smoky darkness).

On September 11, 1683 Islam was at the peak of its expansion in the West. 300,000 Islamic troops, under the command of Kara Mustafa, were besieging the city they called 'The Golden Apple'  Vienna. The aim of Kara Mustafa was to lead his army on to Rome and transform the Basilica of St. Peter into a mosque. If all of this never came about, it's due to an Italian monk, Marco d'Aviano and a Polish King, Jan Sobieski. This is their story.

Most favorite films (and this now is one of mine!) have moments of great dialog, conveying in a few well-chosen words, what is ""really at stake here. One such moment comes as Father Marco, works a miracle of peace, talking down a nighttime mob, carrying torches and swords, young Christian men intent on killing Father Marco's Turkish friend, Abul. While his friend remains within the safety of his home, one of his four wives, a deaf mute girl, goes to her knees before the mob and, with frantic hand gestures and wordless grunts, appeals for mercy  for her husband.

Father Marco holds up a crucifix and prays; suddenly the crowd retreats, still uttering threats (We'll be back and next time you won't have a monk to protect you! We'll get you, Turk!)

Moments later, the scene shifts to inside the candle-lit home, where Marco  speaking first to to his Turkish friend's brave young wife -- says to her: You risked your life! You shouldn't have done that! Then turning to his friend Fr. Marco asks, gently: Why didn't YOU (go out and) defend yourself?

ABUL: It is Allah who decides our destiny [which is] too big to try to avoid it.

MARCO: You know, Abul . . . years ago when I was studying in the seminary, I thought a lot about how (pauses, measures his words) . . . how your god is so different from mine. I asked myself, 'Why does God allow so many, many people to believe in a god who is not himself?' And I realized it was so his sons could carry his light  to wherever it is needed. After a long pause, Marco says with a warm smile, One day Abul, you too will see the true light.

ABUL: All lights are true, Marco.
MARCO: There is only ONE True Light, Abul . . . only one!

Did I say that this movie opens with a quote from Marc (Benjamin) Bloch  a distinguished French historian who fought for France in both World Wars and was captured and executed by the Gestapo  10 days after the D-Day invasion of Normandy  for working with the French resistance.

As a number of reviewers have already stated, it could have been a much, much better movie. I'm of the opinion when it comes to movies, if it's not a hit, the next best thing is for it to become a cult classic. This is neither, and rather than bash the screenwriters, I will just say that I enjoyed the scenery and the costumes. The battle at Vienna, as important and as horrendous as it was, is not a frame of history in America. While I do not profess to be extremely knowledgable regarding the siege and battle, I have studied the era and cultures involved and do have somewhat of a grasp on it.
As an aside, I first read of the Siege of Vienna many years ago via a short story by Robert E. Howard, ""The Shadow of the Vulture."" One of the characters - Mikhal Oglu - amazed me and I wanted to know if he and/or his military function was based in reality.

6381288,5,B00JLJ0AI8,"This film is a masterpiece, an historical epic recounting the Ottoman Turks invasion and siege of Vienna, the gateway to the West, on September 11, 1683. This is a moment in history when Christendom and Western civilization truly hung in the balance. The stellar international cast includes F. Murray Abraham (as the Christian monk, Marco DAviano), Jerzy Skoliumowski (as the legendary Polish king, Jan III Sobieski), Claire Bloom (as Marco DAvianos mother), and Enrico Lo Verso (as Kara Mustafa, the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Turks). The movie is historically accurate and one wonders why this film is not listed in the filmography of F. Murray Abraham and Claire Bloom on Wikipedia. Is it because of the favorable pious and tolerant description of the Christian monk or simply because it is an Italian-Polish production and not a production by Hollywood? The battle scenes are realistic and a graphic extravaganza as one would imagine happened during the historic siege of Vienna, when the Ottoman tide was turned. And this was a momentous event. Ottoman sultans had stated that their ultimate goal was the conquest of the West and the turning of Christian churches and gothic cathedrals, including St. Peters in Rome, into mosques! To make this a reality they amassed a 300,000 man army against a divided Christendom. The salvation of the Christians in the fortified and besieged city of Vienna, the golden Apple, is the mounted Polish cavalry, the winged hussars, led by their king, Jan Sobieski   40,000 men who turned out to be only 20,000 in number! The fluid geopolitics of the times (e.g., the politics of the Sun King, Louis XIV of France, who was not shown, in relation to the Austrian Emperor and the Turkish sultan) are accurately described.
One hopes that neither the magnificent war horses or the stunt men were hurt in the bloody scenes. The movie even has its light hearted moments with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold Is panicky mannerisms during moments of crisis. He and his court are depicted much worse than I suspect the historic Hapsburg emperor was, despite his prudent and speedy flight from Vienna. The Ottoman sultan is briefly depicted in a more imperious and statesmen-like manner, even though by this time most sultans were depraved as well as treacherous. The Christian monk, Marco DAviano, and his adversary, Kara Mustafa, are reverently treated. The dramatic contrast between the characters and their religions, as much as the battle scenes, are magnificently displayed in the film.
This movie is highly recommended without caveats for all viewers  from history buffs for enjoyment to homeschoolers for cinematographic supplementation of their history curriculum. Rating: 5-star epic, historic movie recommended by MAF.",1454198400,10,2750,5.161434977578475

The Ottoman Turkish siege of Vienna in the summer of 1683 lasted about 2 months, with deprivations and heroics on the part of the defenders - outnumbered 20:1 - on an almost unbelievable scale, Do we get a sense of that? No. Do we get to know the citizens of Vienna or  Ernst Rdiger Graf Starhemberg, who, despite being grievously wounded early on, commanded the defense of his city? No. Do we learn about the horrific atrocities committed by the invaders on the population of the Balkans on their way to Vienna or the population of the areas surrounding Vienna before and during the siege? No. Do we get the bloody drama of sappers digging tunnels - the Turks in order to blow up the walls, the Viennese in order to stop them - and the desperate hand-to-hand combat ensuing inside those tunnels? No. Do we get the many assaults on the walls, led by Janissaries - European children kidnapped from their homes, raised as Muslims in Turkey and taught to be soldiers of the Sultan - repulsed time and again by a small number of fiercely determined defenders? No. Do we get the frustrating, time-consuming political haggling behind the scenes, attempts to alert a sleeping Europe to the deadly threat appearing yet again on its' southeastern frontier? No.
What we do get is a fantasy story about an Italian monk (What? Oh wait, it's an Italian-Polish co-production, Italian director, probably mostly paid by RTI, that's why) with near-supernatural powers and a weirdly concocted love story between his best Muslim friend (???) and a blonde (!!!) Turkish girl.
And we get the always gorgeous Isabella Orsini having a bad dream, which may be the best part of the movie.

6381296,5,B00JLJ0AI8,"This is a fascinating film on many levels.  The film itself details the Siege of Vienna in 1683, and on its surface, is a really good war film.  But, the film has a much deeper message to it that rings very true in modern times.  While the film has its war component, its main message is a warning about Islam and its absolute incompatibility with Western civilization.  The main impact character is a Catholic priest and hardcore Christian, seeking peace amongst even those who would have his head.  This ultimately proves futile, as, in the film, Islam refuses to live in peace and harmony with much of anything.  The priest defends a local Islamic and protects him from a lynching, only to have that same Islamic later betray both his nation and his wife for the sake of Islam.  It is one of the few films out there that explores and exposes the dark (but accurate) side of Islam and its ""conquer and destroy at all costs"" core beliefs.
This would be an interesting pick for a Christian movie night or for those who want to study films with a message.  This film certainly has one, and it is certain to inspire discussion once one sees past its war film surface.",1449187200,,1165,4.488151658767772

was not familiar of the Siege of Vienna by them.  I am more familiar of their taking of Constantinople and later invading Romania where Vlad
Dracula (Vlad the  Impaler)  helped stop the Moslem horde by butchering the prisoners he caught (no tears here!) during supper time.  Anyhow,
I found this film very interesting, well made, cast well and good action.  I did not realize the Moslems (yes, I spelled it MY way!) came so close
to taking a major European city even as early Americans were settling in , well, America.  But if Vlad was vicious so were the Moslems.  One
of the reasons for the Crusades was to take back lands stolen from the East Roman Empire and other Christian states that Mohammad stole from
the Christians.  I felt the movie portrayed both sides fairly, though I understand the  Moslems did kill all the women taken captive after they
""entertained"" the troops, though Christian soldiers in the crusades did not always act ""Christian"" toward the enemy prisoners either.  Anyhow,
some pretty interesting battle scenes, especially with the cannon works.  I recommend this for Euro historian fanantics.  I got my DVD at Amazon

6381307,1,B00JLJ0AI8,"This movie is a mess.  In short, it takes one of the most interesting, important battles of post-medieval history and turns it into a tedious bore.

There are some good actors in this film who simply can't rise above some of the worst dialogue ever committed to film.  Some very interesting ""real people"" are left out so the film can be populated with more boring fictitious people.

Much of the dialogue, most notably in the battle scenes appears to have been dubbed in later, by the same actors saying the same things.  For instance, in one of the attacks, as you watch the Turks charge, you hear a voice yelling something like, ""Quickly, quickly, out of the trench!""  Ten seconds later, as you watch the Viennese defenders, you hear the same voice yelling something like, ""Quickly, everyone, to the walls!""  Same guy, on both sides.  Laughable.

The battle scenes, which could have been spectacular, are amateurishly put together, and the best part of the film is the end, which is at least based loosely on something that really happened.

Skip this mess and read ""The Enemy at the Gate"", by Andrew Wheatcroft, for a much more exciting and involving account of the Siege of Vienna.",1435363200,5,1185,4.736585365853658

But the true portrayal of the conflict would have been a lot richer if it had been divided into two parts so the audience could have a better familiarity with the characters and the history of this particular battle.  I didn't see the priest as being Catholic as much as I saw him depending on God the way that I think God wants all of us to depend on him.  And as God used Gideon's small army to victoriously defeat a vast army in Judges 6 and 7, He was perfectly capable of giving wisdom to a Polish monarch to win over the Turkish hordes. Ps 24:8  ""Who is this King of glory?  The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.""  There is also an illusion in a scene of the priest holding up his arms during the battle to the story of Moses holding up his arms until there was victory in Ex 17:10-13 .  This movie did not attack the decency or well meaning intentions of the religious Islamic people of Turkey.

6381325,5,B00JLJ0AI8,"One of the most edifying films I have seen all year or am likely to see until the end of the year. In other words, this film will do both your mind and soul good! Reject the shallow critics who judge merely on appearances and are blithely unaware of the depths of goodness inherent to this film project.

Many judge on faithful representation of historical reality (in which this film shines) or on mere technical excellence (which this film does also exhibit, despite the discounters, who probably oppose its message). These are simply the 1st and 2nd levels of film criticism. Yet it is on the most important, ultimate, tertiary 3rd level of film criticism that this film truly astounds in a most marvelous manner!

For this film reveals that spirit must underlie any significant physically world-changing phenomenon. We see how the great spiritual evil of aboriginal imperialistic Muhammadan Islam underlies those waging physical war against Christianity (Europe, the Vatican, leaders of the Church, the Church in any form at all), and we see how God must work through a man in order to successfully resist this spiritual-physical imperialism.

Thus the character of the monk (a true, historical figure) is extremely far from secondary, as reductionist fools assert. He is both a central historical cause and a significant literary link to weld the various factors into a truly enjoyably and coherent whole. Without the Soldier of Christ, the entire world will be subject to the wickedness of evil men--oppressing, enslaving, etc.

Not only is there nothing wrong with this film but there is also very much RIGHT with it! Buy this film and grow mentally and spiritually in order to stop today's Islamic (and Humanist and any other kind of) imperialism, as was done in the prior two waves of global jihad.",1413936000,2,1807,4.973509933774834

It is amusing in one sense, frightening in another to hear the discussion of the available forces to meet the 300,000 invaders on western civilizationS doorstep.  But this is not a simplistic tale of good versus evil.  The Italian Monk and the Grand Vizier are friends but either sees the survival of their faith as dependent on the others destruction.  The Monks suggestion to the Grand Vizier to let God decide the issue might be interpreted as God is on our side. But learning to live in peace with each other is the only real victory.",1411862400,,770,4.591240875912408
6381329,1,B00JLJ0AI8,"When I saw many of the reviews on this and other websites I immediately thought they were plants, but as I looked around on webforums to gauge general opinions it's clear that there are a lot of Euro-supremacists or Islamophobes out there who genuinely think this is a good movie.

For those of you whose judgement isn't clouded by cultural bias, this will be one of the worst war movies ever made.

It's difficult to decide where I should start, but the most obvious place is the script, which is hammy and overwrought. It attempts to give the words of these historical figures a profound weight that just comes off as lame melodrama. The acting is also terrible despite some decent talents, likely due to the incompetent script and amateurish directing.

As for the production values, there are none. This film was done as cheaply as possible, with one or two men on horseback copied and pasted into a flat static background to give the impression of a whole army. This is typical for historical pieces on a limited budget, but efforts are made to suspend the viewer's disbelief by giving the digitally copied ranks some variance. Not so here. Clone armies and congregations abound. The fight scenes are also incredibly lame, with a handful of men running at each other, shooting and swinging their swords, with the impacts coming off as incredibly lame digital blood effects superimposed onto their bodies in what could just as well be Windows Movie Maker. The production of this movie is so cheap that they couldn't even set their own fires, but copied and pasted the same fire across the digitally fogged up countryside.

History buffs will also be eating their turbans in frustration. A weak effort is made at establishing a moral equivalency between Christians and Muslims that feels like reading a checklist more than watching a movie. Despite those bones thrown to Political Correctness, the script leans heavily against Islam as a barbaric force seeking to subjugate all of Christianity, with a heaping helping of Christian aggrandizement. The amazing thing about this is, that despite how comically evil the movie portrays the Ottomans it actually pulls its punches. In real life, the Ottoman Empire was the most terrifying force in Europe. Kamal Mustafa massacred every town in his way, even the ones that surrendered.  Which guaranteed that Vienna's defenders never considered surrender an option. He made several tactical errors during the siege and battle as well, none of which are portrayed by the film. They also took 30,000 hostages from the countryside and massacred them all on September 12th, as they fought with the Coalition army. Those hostages are only shown in one scene so that the Sympathetic Turk character can rescue his deaf/mute Italian wife from the stockade.

Yes, there is a sub-plot where a pregnant deaf/mute follows Marco D' Aviano across Europe so she can reunite with her baby daddy.

Jan Sobieski is also name-dropped at the beginning of the movie with the claim that this is ""his story"" along with Marco D' Aviano. That's a lie. This movie is all about Marco D' Aviano, with Sobieski not even showing his face until 2/3s of the way through the film. He only gets a handful of spoken dialogue at the Austrian war council, so if you're expecting any kind of real perspective from the Poles you're not going to get it here.

Hundreds of minutes of wasted time and potential litter this film during its unforgiveable 2 hour running time. I watched this on a lark, but ended up genuinely offended purely at how every single element of this movie is wrong and bad. If a friend recommends this movie you're better off without them.

The saintly monk played so well by Abraham actually existed and really was like the man that he portrays. The film is too short to pay proper respect to all the key figures, and suggests a kind of spllcing together of a much longer film.
