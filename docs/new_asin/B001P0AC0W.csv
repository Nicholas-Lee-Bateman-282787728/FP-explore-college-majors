8501144,2,B001P0AC0W,"It looks like a cute show, but the subtitles are so bad it is painful. Names are mistranslated from Japanese Kanji into a Mandarin translation, words are misspelled ending up with a very confusing dialog. Sometimes I could not tell if they were talking about a person or a thing. It is a common problem with DVD's from China. I recommend you spend your money elsewhere unless you speak Japanese fluently. I have no idea about the quality of the Chinese subtitles  ;)",1249257600,,466,4.614457831325301
