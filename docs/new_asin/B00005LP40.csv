7944369,4,B00005LP40,This is a good start for some Anime Starters. This is sort of like old school Japanese Anime. I bought it for price and I remember this series when I got into watching Anime.,1352160000,,174,4.147058823529412
7944370,3,B00005LP40,"This is a decent piece of anime, but it is nowhere near as good as say, Ghost In The Shell or Macross Plus but it is not as bad as Pokepuke. There is a good amount of action and the story is pretty interesting but the animation isn't that great; which is the main reason for my 3 star review.",1026518400,,292,3.8833333333333333
7944371,1,B00005LP40,"This is by far the biggest waste of money out there. IT is NOT a movie. It is two stinking episodes of a show with ok action, a decent storyline and bad dubbing. Plus if you want to see the rest YOU CAN'T its the only one of these! I made the mistake of not returning this after I got it for my birthday. If you buy this you will definitely be sorry.",1016236800,,350,3.808219178082192
