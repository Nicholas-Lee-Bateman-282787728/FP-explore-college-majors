3822515,4,B001VH7AB8,"St Benedict's Rule is a short documentary created primarily thru interviews of the monastics at Conception Abbey interspersed with footage of their daily life. Both old timers and young postulants are interviewed, and the shooting incident, in which 2 monastics were killed, is covered from various view points. All in all, not a bad dvd for anyone interested in what monastic life is really like. Of course, this isn't an action packed thriller nor a tear jerker, just very human people telling their own simple stories.",1240444800,6,521,5.069767441860465

8346386,5,B001VH7AB8,"If you are looking for an ""edge of your seat"" adventure, or a side-splitting comedy, or a tear-jerking drama... Then you are probably in the wrong place. This is just the very real story of some men who have chosen to pursue relationship with God in their lives by taking vows as Benedictine monks. However, since they are very human people, and share openly about their experiences, there are dashes of all of those genres in this documentary. They share openly about how they came to the monastery, what life is like for them there, why they stay, and also about a tragic shooting that took place and led to the death of two of their monastic brothers. To hear the experiences of the men who came face to face with the shooter and managed to survive, and all the rest of the brothers who lost two members of their community, and how they responded with love, grace, and forgiveness is amazing. I really enjoyed this simple, beautiful film.",1437955200,2,941,4.57396449704142

8346388,5,B001VH7AB8,"This movie tells quite a story.  You have to wait until near the end to get the details of the violence that invaded this monastery.  Prior to that, the movie is just telling us details of the monks' lives, what it is like to live that way.  Very well done.",1384387200,,257,4.1
8346389,5,B001VH7AB8,"I just finished a Sabbatical visiting monasteries.  Conception Abbey was not one of them but I believe I'd truly love to visit there one day and take a retreat at their abbey.  This is an interesting narrative very much in the words of the monks telling of their lives, their vocations, and discussing a dreadful shooting in 2002.  It is a very loving and gentle movie about loving and gentle monks.",1376179200,,399,4.591549295774648

8346391,5,B001VH7AB8,"Good exposition of what the life in a Trappist monastery is all about. It showed the monks as they are, real people just like the rest of us and also showed the amazing forgiveness after the tragedy of the killings that happened when a deranged stranger came in and killed several monks.",1350604800,,287,4.538461538461538
8346392,5,B001VH7AB8,"In August I will be starting as a student at Conception Seminary College. Just out of curiosity I got this as a way to know how the monks, who run the school, live out their vocation. It was amazing. It gives a very informative look into the Benedictine Order and how these ordinary men try to live an extraordinary life. Mr. Kanzler did such a good job of showing how these monks have come through tragedy to continue to embrace Christ.",1248998400,5,437,4.407407407407407
