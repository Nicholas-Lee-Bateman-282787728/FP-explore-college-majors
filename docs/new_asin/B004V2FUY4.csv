8442806,5,B004V2FUY4,The story also runs on the wheels of suspense and drama. Video songs shot indoors are not of good quality as if rain pouring down during the recording. The rest of the videography is of very good quality. Full of hit songs. Played by very many of super movie stars especially  Jitendra and Asha  Parekh of Hum Hindustani.,1483401600,,321,4.517241379310345
8442807,4,B004V2FUY4,"Caravan is one of Nasir Hussain's biggest and better known box office hits that boosted the careers of Asha Parekh and Jeetendra. It is also regarded as a mini-classic by certain critics.
Asha plays a rich girl who goes mad after her father kills himself by jumping from a window. A greedy baddie exploits her vulnerability by forcing her to marry him so he can get all her riches. Once it dawns on Asha what has happened, she escapes into a forest and hides from her evil husband. She encounters Jeetendra and his sidekick who both live in a caravan. And from there on follows a contrived adventure.
Asha gives a good performance as the confused girl. Jeetendra is..., well, his usual annoying self. The songs are the best particularly 'Ab Jo Mile Hain' and 'Kitna Pyara Wadha...'.",1305158400,,782,4.673913043478261
