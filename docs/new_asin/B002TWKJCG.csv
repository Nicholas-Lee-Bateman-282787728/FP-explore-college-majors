8607335,4,B002TWKJCG,"Explore sea life park Hawaii is a video advertising and showcasing a marine life park in Hawaii, and shows some of the staff who work at the park caring for the animals there.

There's not much to say about this, but it is somewhat dated (The video was originally made in 1990) but not much. There's plenty of footage of the park's animals in action, so if you enjoy watching that, there's some available.

The best part of the tape is the part where a park worker feeds the fish in the tank. Not because it looks cool seeing the fish surround her...

...it's because she looks pretty darned good in the bikini she does it in.",1413676800,,626,4.333333333333333
