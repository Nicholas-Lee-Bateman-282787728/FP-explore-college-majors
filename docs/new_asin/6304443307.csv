877518,1,6304443307,"One of the last in ""the giant monster from sea"" genre of the 50's
""Gorgo"" officially being the last in 1961 before the japan imports
came in.
  The story concerns that of a mysterious radioactive force that
not only seems to wash up mountains of dead fish on england shore
but infects one man's hand & kills another.  An investigation by  Marine biologist uncovers the radioactivity's source from that of
the titled creature, a huge brontasaur left over from ""King Kong""
who proceeds to stomp London and burn all within it's radioactive
range.
  Another of my favorites from the creature feature era This film
was probably Willis O'Brien's swan song as his creation stirs the
streets of Merry old in all it's glory one would tend to think on
life had come full circle from his brontosaur of the ""Lost world""
made some 30 years earlier,Unlike ""The beast from 20,000 fathoms""
This film takes on a darker tone focusing more on the science and
the aftermath of radiation (showing burn victims, fishing market
slumps etc)& in addition a memorable score. Gene Evans in one of
his few goodguy roles accompanies Andre Morell as Prof. Bigford
  Special effect range from a wonderful entrance by the creature
on the docks to the quickie shot of the beast's wooden head on a
makeshift raft. You wouldn't see this sequence on warner bros.vhs
version of The giant behemoth though. I wouldn't believe that the
company responsible for so many classics like ""The African Queen""
& ""The Roaring 20's"" would be too cheap to use a 90 min tape. The
picture quality is great but I hope the dvd will be more complete

877519,5,6304443307,I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO OWN THIS GREAT MOVIE ON VHS.I AM HOPING THAT IT WILL APPEAR ON DVD.IT IS VERY RARELY SHOWN ON TV. THE LAST TIME BEING 1992. I REMEMBNER WHEN I WAS A KID WATCHING THIS MOVIE.I ACTUALLY CRIED WHEN THEY BLEW THE BEHEMOTH UP!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT PIECE OF HORROR MOVIE HISTORY!!!!!!!,1072742400,5,308,4.421052631578948
877520,4,6304443307,"Okay, a lot of criticism has been said about this movie,and I'd like to also add my two cents worth. First, like most science fiction movies in the 50's, this wasn't meant to be a major production, unlike most of the movies like this at that time, the makers wanted to have a monster that wasn't a man in suit or other and opted to have what was known at that time as the best special effect for these types of film known as stop-motion animation, only two people did stop-motion at that time that was really good, Ray Harryhausen, who did all the animation himself, and gotten really exspensive, and the team with Willis O'Brien, which was usually Pete Peterson doing most or all of the animation. Yes, this is the English version sort to speak of ""Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"",but for all its shortcomings still is a decent monster flick. Aside from the same car being stepped on 3 times in different ranges of the same shot, I find the animation of the Behemoth as pretty good, especially when it comes up on the dock, walks down the pier, and attacks a crane all in the same shot, also the same when it attacks power lines later on in the film. Also the skin detail has to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen on an animated model, actually looking like real reptile skin. Performances by the actors are all good, never could figure why they got Gene Evens though, who usually played in westerns or as tough guy sergents, although he is good and beleivable in this film. Another thing about this film is has to be the most butchered film I've ever seen. The video release from Warners Bros video has the ferry scene and several others gone from it as well as what follows after that scene, making it 9 minutes shorter than it really is. I bought this video twice with that problem. After that I tried to record it off the SCI-FI Channel and it was really cut, all the way down to 67 minutes. I finally thought I'd buy it again and this time it has all the scenes in making it the 80 minute film it was origially timed at. I guess what really intrigues about this film is how it starts off as a mysterious death type play and finally comes down to a huge prehistoric beast attacking London. One thing to take in consideration about movies like this, movies like these are for us people who grew up with these films and know what they had to offer, unlike the CGI films that promise alot and then (fizz)out.",1059868800,18,2414,4.3547671840354765
877521,2,6304443307,"The set up for this movie is well done. It was obvious that the screen writer did his research on atomic radiation. The way the scientists went about using the clues left behind to discover what they were up against was fascinating and really held my interest(If they were making this stuff up they sure had me fooled).Although,50 minutes into the movie,the monster still hadnt gone on a rampage,I would have easily forgiven this had they just come through with an exciting finaly.
Sadly,thats where everything fell apart.
I read somewhere that Willis O'Brien only had 5 and 1/2 weeks to do the stop-motion effects on the film and boy does it show. When you consider that Ray Harryhausen spent as much as 8 months(maybe longer)on some of his projects,you can imagine how poor and limited the effects were. Stop-motion was a very tedious and time consuming process. Its not something that could be rushed.
Allowed the proper time,Willis could have given this film the ending it deserved(As evidenced by his outstanding work on The Black Scorpion which only came out a year before this one).Unfortunately,the end doesnt justify the journey. Buy The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms instead which is the same plot with much better stop-motion effects.",1014336000,6,1241,4.971153846153846
877522,3,6304443307,"Don't bother with the story, or the acting. This is one of those movies where you fast foward to the monster's rampages. Willis O'Brien ( of ""King Kong"" fame ) does some of the best effects since that  mighty ape conquared the top of the Empire State Building in 1933! On a sad  note, this is the last film he did the effects on. What makes the movie  cool is the setting which is England. I keep hoping for The Beatles or  Austin Powers to appear in the mess of people scurring from the monster (  although The Beatles didn't appear popular for nearly 6 or so years after  this film was made ). The non stop motion scenes are awful. All the scenes  just showing monster close ups was just a terrible display of just a hard  plastic mold of his head, where the mouth or eyes didn't move at all. All  in all, this is a pretty interesting B movie with kicks and everything that  alot of those kind of movies didn't have, but this one does!",957657600,2,937,4.184357541899441
877523,3,6304443307,"This film bears a close resemblance to Ray Harryhausen's ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms."" Although ""Giant Behemoth"" can be viewed as derivative, it's an entertaining film typical of the old  sci-fi/giant monster flicks. The story includes the obligatory fifties  commentary about the ecology hazards of atomic energy.  Behemoth (the name  refers to a passage in the Bible, Job 40:15) is a radioactive, live  dinosaur that is electrically charged in the manner of eels.  Altogether an  antisocial character.  I saw this movie the first time back in the early  sixties.  The radioactive waves broadcast by the creature closely resemble  the ""don't broadcast bad breath"" visual of the Clorets breath  mint TV commercials of the same time period.  When the audience at the  local theater on Saturday afternoon is mostly wise cracking 11 year-olds  (including myself), this bit of unintentional humor kept many rolling in  the aisles, convulsed with laughter.
For some unexplained reason, the VHS  copy of the video I have omits the scene of Behemoth capsizing the river  ferry.  In other matters, the stop motion special effects are competent, if  not spectacular.  The close shots of Behemoth's head and neck look skinny  and snake-like compared to the head and neck in full body shots.  An  obvious technical goof.  Willis O'Brien of ""King Kong"" fame was  on the special effects team, but this film is not in the same league with  Kong in technical effects wizardry.  The scenes of Behemoth framed against  London landmarks recalls O'Brien's 1925 silent film ""The Lost  World,"" which showed a live dinosaur stalking through London streets.  The plot elements of attacking the beast with a radium tipped torpedo shot  from a submarine is another example of devices borrowed from other sci-fi  films of the 1950s. The movie has its share of unintended humor.  The tight  budget is evident when Behemoth goes down the same street and stomps on the  same car against the same background at least three times.  But who cares?  This is great ""Saturday afternoon at the movies"" kind of fun for  nostalgia buffs and kids of all ages.  The best way to view this movie is  put your brain on hold, suspend disbelief for an hour and fifteen minutes,  and enjoy the experience.",950572800,26,2262,5.0027027027027025
877524,2,6304443307,"In fairness, the Giant Behemoth suffers badly from some rather ambitious filmmaking that simply didn't have the technology needed to bring off the special effects.  The plot line is average for this genre, although very  predictable.  In many ways, this is a low budget clone of ""The Beast  from 20,000 Fathoms.""  Still, the film manages to hold one's  attention, and benefits from a nasty if not terribly original ending.  The  Giant Behemoth is nothing to write home about, but you won't be reaching  for the remote control, either.",943833600,8,534,4.9772727272727275
877525,5,6304443307,This movie is so bad it's funny.  I've never seen worse special effects!  It was cheezy!  The monster squashed the same car three times for Pete's sake!  A white outline of the monster swam through the water!,935798400,,208,4.54054054054054

877610,3,6304443307,"Id seen this once long ago but after reading an essay on the movie in a Monster fanzine I determined to watch it again. The movie is a tepid B&W outing that follows the typical nuclear testing/ radioactive waste dumps awakens monster that soon runs amok formula. Its a slow crawl through to the films end where the titular monster, a sort of brontosaurus-on-steroids type of irradiated titan, is seen in all of its short screen time glory. There are some good shots of the monster and the print is pretty clear for the most part so it also allows us to see cracks in the stop motion muppet a little too often but its forgivable. What may be most interesting to some beside the fact that the Behemoth is scorching with radiation and can sear its victims in a blinding flash of breath is that this was the final fx film that Willis OBrien (1933s King Kong) may have worked on. Director Eugene Lourie is also famous among monster enthusiasts as the director responsible for the fantastic beastie films Gorgo (a later film of about 2 years) and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (an earlier film of about 6 years). Because of the films slow pacing (and it still is a short film but made to feel longer due to the pacing) and lack of mad monster screen time except at the very end this film has to rate low on most giant monster/ dinosaur enthusiasts film scales. I cant say that I don't like (2 stars on Amazons rating system) but my overall satisfaction is closer to a 2.5 stars. I just cant bring myself to round it down to 2 like I usually would.",1487289600,,1541,4.372822299651568

877654,3,6304443307,"The Giant Behemoth is one hour an nineteen minutes and was released in theaters on March 3, 1959. The movie is mainly about a giant electric radioactive Palaeosaurus that is swimming up the Thames River in London to die in its final resting place. The scientists believe that the radiation that has infected the giant beast is not dying fast enough so they build a radium bomb and hook it up to a two man submarine to kill the beast. That is you story in a nutshell. The movie is a poor mans version of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. Instead of then monster dying at Brooklyn, New York, this one dies in the River Thames in London, England. Due to this being a low budget picture, you see the same car being smashed in three different scenes, the monster rounding the same building more than once, a tear in the dinosaur model and many more mistakes and goofs. In the end it is an okay movie and The Giant Behemoth gets a C.

877658,3,6304443307,"If you're a fan of Creature Features, then you'll probably want to give this one a shot. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table; radiation is to blame for turning a small lizard into a raging monster, but instead of Tokyo, this monster's city of choice is London. Scientists race to find a way to stop the titular behemoth before all of England is radiated and flattened.

I will give this movie some bonus points for the decent burn make-up they use for victims of the beast's radiation, but the beast itself is on the low end of the spectrum as far as monsters go. At times it looks pretty good, but for most of the film it's a pretty lame, immobile puppet head.

Now, Gene Evans wasn't bad, but the real star was the monster, of course. Even then, that much should've been obvious. I mean, the formula is simple: low budget, mediocre actors, cheezy plot .... have a GREAT monster. Now, you've gotta give 'em credit for a D+ try. I could not have gone farther in light of the techno leap made by King Kong in the 1930's. However, if one is to create a motion picture of this sort, production should have been handled by the Japanese. The ""GODZILLA"" gold standard for this class has never been seriously challenged, and in light of the fact that they were pretty much wiped out in WW2, they are the masters of Techno-Cheeze.

Alarming levels of radiation have infused the water, plants and skies, and a radiated paleosaurus rises from the ocean depths. In its path: London. In its arsenal: a strength to topple buildings (King Kong's Willis O'Brien contributes rampaging stop-motion effects), a stride that flattens cars, a flesh-searing radioactive ray and a ticked-off attitude. That is the blurb. I love that fact that in these old movies you never get to see the monster until really well into the movie.

I wish the company had hired commentators who actually enjoy campy old flicks, instead of two guys who seemed to want to be somewhere else, doing something else, and talking about anything else!

The Thing From Another World, The Monster That Challenged The World, The Crawling Eye, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and It, The Terror From Beyond Space to name a few, these are classic Sci-Fi movies and movies I have in my collections that I've seen countless times, timeless movies you can watch over and over again without boredom setting in.
The Giant Behemoth is another one of these, it's a movie that rivals The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, although the animation of this creature is not as fluid as Ray Harryhausen's, but I did enjoy this movie a lot and I still do every time I see it.
Dead fish are washing up on the beach along the coast in the London area and nobody knows why, scientists study the fish and find high levels of radioactivity in the fish but they still don't know what is killing them till one night when a fisherman is found dead on the beach, his face horribly burned, according to the scientists, by radiation.
After the fisherman's funeral, one of the locals and the fisherman's daughter go for a walk on the beach and find a pile of some substance jammed against the rocks, well the inquisitive fisherman ends up getting his hand burned by the stuff and gets treated by the local doctor, who brings in two scientists, one played by character actor Gene Evans.
They go to the beach to investigate after the fisherman saw and the daughter describes what the father saw before he died, they search the beach but conclude the stuff that burned the fisherman's hand got washed out with the tide but after taking a sample of the burns from the man's hand, they discover it came from the stomach lining of a large creature (NICE...had your breakfast yet???).

877773,4,6304443307,"Just a few random thoughts why I have liked this movie since I was eight years old, when my grandma took me to see it in a dingy little theater in Chicago (with ""The Cosmic Man,"" 1959).  You get to see tough guy Gene Evans as an oceanographic scientist, spewing marine data instead of shreds of a chewed-up cigar.  You meet a stunningly blonde Cornwall girl whose dad was the first victim of, and namer of, Behemoth.  Instead of becoming a love interest for rugged Gene, she simply disappears from the story.  There's great 1950s English-style music by Edwin Astley (""Adventures of Robin Hood,"" ""Danger Man,"" ""The Prisoner""). You get an attack by Behemoth on a Thames ferry boat that first establishes the passenger types (mother and daughter with dolly, young couple with happy life together waiting before them) as officers and crewmen do their duties.  This makes the attack and sinking of the ferry more tragic and horrifying.  We see helpless victims drowning and the forlorn dolly floating alone.

  There's Irish actor Jack MacGowran as a poetic dinosaur scientist who always knew some day Behemoth would return to the world. When Behemoth commences his long-awaited raid on London's dockside slums, we see a good assortment of grown-up English people in their rain slickers and dowdy clothes running madly for their lives.  This was red meat for director Eugene Lourie, who also directed the rampaging dinosaurs of ""Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" and ""Gorgo.""  A gaggle of tough old Londoners stop at a street corner to try and stare down Behemoth, maybe thinking, ""We took the worst of the Blitz and you don't scare us one bit!""  Behemoth lets loose his radioactive electrical force, and the Londoners cringe, with screams identical to those heard in ""King Kong"" in 1933.  Special effects veteran Willis O'Brien worked on both movies.  At the finale of the people-running scene, there is a particularly frenzied young man in a suit and white shirt with no tie, leading the pack, who always reminds me of singer Tom Jones (""He's a BE-HE-MOTH, woe woe woe, a BE-HE-MOTH!!"")  Also, if you look, you can see the farm boy in the dark sweater who was roasted mid-picture, resurrected and running with the city people!

  Less wonderful is the shot of Behemoth squashing one of those little English cars, when it is used for the third time.  Also, why did the two young fools decide to retrieve their car just as Behemoth was approaching it?  For the thrill of seeing them scream helplessly as Behemoth picks it up in his mouth and swings it around before hurling it into the Thames, of course!  Movie ends with a morose news report from America suggesting that all these events are going to happen all over again across the sea.",1431648000,3,2727,4.809012875536481

We don't get to see the Creature come ashore until 1 hour and 5 min. into the film and by then, if you're still awake, it's appearance is anticlimactic . The SFX budget must have only been a few shillings because what we see is fuzzy, somewhat out of focus and with awful backgrounds. Hard to believe this ever got theatre-released.

A lot of these movies have a great tie in to those experiences, and sometimes the cheesier the better as in Beverly Garland's It Conquered The World, Them, The Giant Claw, or The Crawling Eye. Even Steve McQueen's The Blob ranked in the awesome bad so good category of monster flicks. So is with The Giant Behemoth as yet another monster on the loose in the city where citizens run amuck. Of course this was done much better with Harryhausen's Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but I like the diversity & scope. Gorgo had tremendous effects of a monster running loose in the city, and they spared no expense, but this movie has the famous boat capzlsizing scene, & that's a plus for this one as well as the radioactive circles emulating from the beast bringing a melting experience to it's local victims.",1410912000,,1088,4.696335078534031

It is slow & dull and once the animation starts (about 60 minutes in), it isn't really wasn't worth the wait. What I've chosen to write about is the commentary of this film by two special effects icons, Phil Tippet & Dennis Muren.

If done well, I really like a film commentary if done by the various people associated with a specific movie one way or another. FX techs, actors or directors involved can really add to a movie by offering insights and anecdotes about the movie's genesis and the movie making process itself.

But for two guys who've been in the special effects biz for over 30 years, I was astounded at the snarky, ill informed remarks both of these guys made concerning this film. Admittedly, there really isn't that much you can say that is good about this movie, but their vague references to others films of the period in the genre are, well, uniformed to say the least. Lots of ""I think this what happened"" or ""I heard this once but I'm not sure"", I mean, why the hell were these two guys hired for this gig in the first place? They certainly didn't bring anything to the party. They constantly compared this movie to 'Beast' but they don't seem to know that much about 'Beast' either. It was as if the people that threw the commentary together had dragged two guys off the street that a passing knowledge of stop motion animation, sat them in front of a mic and said, ""Talk about whatever you're gonna see and try to be funny about it.""  Neither of these guys did any prep work from what I could determine and it shows. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE what these two giants of the industry have brought to the screen, but their 'effort' was as pathetic as the film they just critiqued.",1406419200,2,1939,4.42577030812325

878239,5,6304443307,"The redundantly titled The Giant Behemoth (originally titled Behemoth, the Sea Monster) is a sub-par sci-fi potboiler from director Eugene Lourie and special effects maestro Willis O'Brien. It's loaded to the gills with padding, padding and more padding, and what stop-motion animation footage was done by O'Brien and his team is looped quite a bit during the Paleosaurus' initial London rampage. That said, for what it is, it isn't bad.

Once one accepts that it's a B-movie it can be enjoyed. There's s'more stop-motion goodness to be had after the London walkabout, involving the Paleosaurus destroying some powerlines and then picking up a car with some people inside and tossing it into the Thames.

Several scenes in the film pay homage to both Lourie's and O'Brien's earlier films. The Paleosaurus picking the car up is a nod to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms apparently, while the dinosaur causing a bridge to collapse with its weight, dumping itself unintentionally into the Thames, is a throwback to O'Brien's original 1925 special effects masterpiece, The Lost World. I also love that almost all of the screams used in the film are recycled from 1933's King Kong!

As for the DVD itself, it features what is to my mind a wonderful print of the film, positively gorgeous, or as gorgeous as Giant Behemoth is gonna get.

On the downside we have the audio commentary by Phil Tippet and Denis Muren, which....severely tarnished my respect for these post-Harryhausen effects men. Not only do they need to do some serious fact-checking (they confuse Edmund Gwenn in Them! with Cecil Kellaway from Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, they also: forgot about Beast's prehistoric plague subplot (mistakenly believing that film's Rhedosaurus to be radioactive), think that Cornwall isn't in England (it is), and don't even know that name of the dinosaur in this film; when the comic relief paleontologist Dr. Sampson calls it a Paleosaurus, they mishear it as ""Gorgosaurus."" Possibly worst of all is how...vindictive they are towards this film, especially towards the end. They mock it mercilessly, and not in a very good natured way either.

878303,4,6304443307,"I first became aware of this film when I was very young and you could buy 8mm ""shorts"" of films at department stores.  This was one of the ones I bought.  They packed the whole movie into just a few minutes.

In the past few years, as DVDs have replaced VHS tapes, many of these old films have been cost effectively released.  Before I purchased this from Amazon, I had never seen the movie in its complete theatrical format.

This is one of many 50's era giant radioactive monster films.  In this case it is a Paleosaurus, which for the purposes of this movie, is a aggressive sauropod looking thing.

The movie starts out with a bang with stock film of a of nuclear explosions.  It turns out that we are in a scientific conference about the environmental dangers of nuclear weapons.  This information provides a backdrop as story unfolds.

The transfer is generally very good, with a few exceptions where some minor scratching and other artifacts are evident.  It does not take away from the film, however.

The casting and acting are good.  The writing is fine, although, as expected, the pacing is slow by today's standards and the expectations of the ADD generation.  Older viewers will be more patient.  The musical score is also good, although a little over the top in some of the indoor scenes.  There are some beautiful and interesting shots of English villages, old architecture, and vehicles.

The story unfolds like a mystery as scientists and government officials try to figure out the source of radiation fish kills.  As it turns out, of course, there is a monster which, after teasing us for awhile, will eventually make it's way onto the screen and wreak havoc.  The first shots of the ""Behemoth"" are a arched neck with a mouth that never movies.  This is so obviously a cheap puppet that it really does the rest of the film a disservice.  There is also a scene where a jet aircraft is landing and the engine sounds are clearly that of a propeller aircraft.

The famous ferry sinking scene is included.  It supposedly was deleted from TV versions of the film.  It was an important scene to keep, and I thought it was mild by today's standards.

When the Behemoth attacks London during the last 25 minutes, the film shines as we finally make the switch to stop motion animation.  The creature itself is well done and delivers on screen.  There is a magnificent scene where the creature breaches an electrical substation.  It probably was inspired by the original Godzilla, which features an equally spectacular scene.

Another atomic bred giant monster ""Godzilla Wanna-Be"" film.
Very typical of its time, with very sub-par special effects.
Some of the scenes where the MONSTER is stomping on cars and buildings are repeated over and over. This film must of been on a very low budget....it shows. There are a lot of dull moments in this film which seem just to be filler scenes and you keep hoping to see some action and maybe even the MONSTER here and there. I never remember seeing this film on TV in my youth.
The director Eugene Lourie has actually had better sci-fi films to his credit :
(1953) ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms""....much, much better then ""Behemoth""
(1961) ""Gorgo""......almost on par with ""Behemoth"" but you see the monster much more.

I bought this DVD thru Amazon at a marked down price of $5.79. It goes into my collection of 1950 sci-fi films, which I have largely acquired thru Amazon at some amazingly low prices. I find films that I want, save them on my wish list, and when they go on sale I buy them........you can get some great deals and films that you just can't find elsewhere.",1266796800,3,1116,4.575

Million Dollar Movie was a 90 minute time slot so truncated versions of the films were shown. This DVD is actually the first time I have seen the film in it's entirety. Not a great movie but so typical of the 50's monster movie genre you can't help but enjoy it. The DVD is letterboxed and the picture and sound quality very good. The special effects are laughable but that is always part of the fun with these movies. An entertaining evening's viewing. I only rate it as 3 stars simply because to rate it higher would be elevating it to a class of many better sci-fi films. Definitely worth owning, though.",1264636800,3,939,4.497076023391813
878308,2,6304443307,"I remember seeing this as the bottom part of a double-feature when I was nine years old.  And while I knew it was a low budget movie, I figured I would give it another shot.  I decided to watch the dvd with the audio commentary by two of the major special effects guys at ILM.  It was the first time I can remember an audio commentary wherein the commentators knew very little about the film they were talking about.  They were wrong about the year it was released (1959) and did not know the name of the star of the film (Gene Evans) although they did admit to seeing him before.  Most of their commentary was talking about the endless padding needed to bring this film to its almost 90 minute length, since the film did not have the budget for many special effects and as a result the monster was seen very infrequently.  They described how boring it must have been for a 12 year old to sit through this film.  (I was nine and don't really remember being tremendously bored.)  I did enjoy them comparing this film to some of Harryhausen's although they did throw Spielberg's name in for some reason, I guess to show us that they were two of the major special effects technicians on ""Jurassic Park.""  I wish they would have discussed the director's (Eugene Lourie) next giant monster film ""Gorgo"" a little more.  I've always enjoyed that film.
As for the film itself, the special effects are pretty poor in this black and white film.  If you want a pretty mediocre sci. fi film from the '50s, but a fairly good indication of the type of low budget sci. fi. extravaganzas they made in those days, then you will enjoy this film.  I grew up during this period and loved the sci. fi., horror and fantasy films of my childhood.  However, I'll take ""Godzilla,"" ""Gorgo"" or any of Harryhausen's films over this one any day.",1264204800,2,1816,4.450151057401813
878309,3,6304443307,"Eugene Lourie (pronounced Lure-YAY) was a Russian born French art director and production designer who worked with such directors as Jean Renoir, Charlie Chaplin, and Clint Eastwood. Out of the nearly 50 feature films he was associated with, he directed only 4 of them and they all had a science-fiction background. 3 of the 4 are giant monster films beginning with THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953) and ending with GORGO (1961). The fourth is COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK (1958). Right after COLOSSUS is BEHEMOTH THE SEA MONSTER (1959) or as it is known in America, THE GIANT BEHEMOTH (Department of Redundancy Department anyone?). This is usually and somewhat understandably ranked third in the so called ""Dino Trilogy"" but it is my favorite of the three.

While it is essentially a British recycling of 20,00 FATHOMS shot on a much smaller budget, it is those two elements that make it more appealing to me. Because of the budget, there is lots of location shooting particularly around Cornwall that is beautiful to look at and effective to the storyline. Being made for British audiences it has a no nonsense approach to the material that makes it seem more important than it is and makes the late appearance of the monster that more effective. Most of the criticism is directed against the monster and while it is somewhat justified it misses the point. Willis O'Brien (who did the original KING KONG) supervised the effects for the Behemoth and he and his team did a creditable job considering the lack of money they had to work with. However it did result in reusing several of the same shots (just as in 1957's THE BLACK SCORPION which O""Brien also did) and repetition weakens their effectiveness.

Looked at today it will seem crude to the CGI generation as well as very slowly paced but for those of us who appreciate stop motion animation and don't mind dialogue where the characters speak in complete sentences and impart information as well, then THE GIANT BEHEMOTH has much to offer. The scenes of the radiation burned victims that gave kids nightmares on the film's original release and when it first played on TV, are still effective today. Unfortunately today's kids are made of sterner stuff and have seen so much more that it probably wouldn't faze them at all which is a shame. You can purchase the individual DVD for a ridiculously low price or as part of a CULT CAMP CLASSIC set (where it doesn't belong) which also includes ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN and QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE.",1258156800,4,2495,4.759815242494226

I'm amazed that all the astute fan reviews have not noted the magnificent spine tingling music score the dramatic lighting in many scenes and the juicy sound effects not to mention the distinctive memorable roar of the monster. There was only one perfect giant monster picture and that was the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms but while the Beast is equivalent to the technical polish of say TVs Twilight Zone
 the Giant Behemoth is like TV's the Outer Limits, rich with atmosphere and it scares the hell out of you. Those hair raising closeups of the monster with those piercing, hypnotic Plutonian eyes. The superbly played out Sherlock Holmes style hunt for the creature in sharp B&W photography filmed mostly on location.  Finally the grippingly presented theme of radioactive fallout was never portrayed to such dramatic effect not even in Godzilla 54'. The ferry scene is chilling because it plays like a commercial almost, seemingly out of place int he movie with a tame documentary style routine and then a female passenger sees somthing big and funny looking in the water and starts to point at it with mild amusement until we hear a woman's scream and the rest is horror movie history. This scene although flawed has taken a famed life of it's own by the infamous deletions it faced in many releases. Like it was banned for being too grim  perhaps which is likely because  the movie was given an x certificate in it's first uk release which in a way makes sense because the film does scare children for real. but from the opening heaving shots of the deep atlantic to the,eyepopping shots of the monster chewing dock cranes ,industrial power lines and incinerating farm boys on piles of hay to the daring underwater climax the Giant Behemoth will make you say WHOA! one way or another before it is over.

Clearly the man liked giant monsters.  Behemoth is in the latter in terms of quality behind both Gorgo and Beast from 20,000 fathoms.

The stop-motion animation was done by Willis O' Brien who did King Kong and was Ray harryhausen's mentor.  The animation itself looks very good as you might expect but the the monster up close looks a little cheap and cheesy.  At any rate the best rampages through London, even destroying London Bridge.

7871321,5,6304443307,"Fan favorite from the late 1950's,  loved by monster fans new and old. The DVD is a complete version, the VHS release is missing the ferry boat attack scene and the evacuation scenes.  Commentary on the DVD is the worst ever, Warner's should have got someone who actually liked the film - not two guys who act like they are working for 'Mystery Science theater'!",1513641600,,362,4.553846153846154
