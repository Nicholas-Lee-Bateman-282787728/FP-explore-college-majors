8325621,3,B000PSISO2,I bought this DVD when I wanted to improve on my watercolor portraits and costume fit. I really benefited on the part of the skin painting. The DVD have at  least 5 to 6 practical videos to learn from. Although its a good reference for skin painting its not a good reference for people who would like to learn more on costume fit (painting the clothing). The author neglected this area.,1312934400,,386,4.436619718309859
8325622,3,B000PSISO2,"While overall I found the video helpful and instructive, the production seems amateurish and clumsy.

First, the DVDs will not play on one of my DVD players. It would only work on one in a room that is not convenient for viewing or painting.

Next, an enormous amount of space is wasted. When I turned on the first DVD of the set, I thought it was defective, as there was white blankness for a long time. And there are more white blank spaces between segments.

There is too much focus on the artist herself. Her face is shown often and for no real reason. The focus should be on the painting and the techniques.

My last complaint is the elevator music. At first it was pleasant, but quickly grew repetitive and very annoying. Silence would be preferable.

The artist does a good job of explaining and demonstrating her work, and I did learn much from the DVDs. Unfortunately, the presentation is often off-putting.",1231200000,8,916,4.595092024539877
8325623,4,B000PSISO2,"I would personally prefer to view this on a TV via a DVD player, however, it will only play back on my computer. This limits where I may view the lesson(s) as I do not have access to a laptop and also effects the enjoyment and ease of watching the lesson(s).

Seller communication regarding this problem, after purchase, was prompt. Seller informed me it is intended for computer use but that ""some"" DVD players ""may"" be able to play it back (none that I own will do so).  The item description should clearly state this is formated and intended for viewing on a computer.

The painting lesson is informative but somewhat hindered by the need to click on several short ""chapters"".  I am comparing it to other watercolor instruction DVD's I own which teach the lesson(s) in a more flowing format.

If you do not mind the format limitations I believe the lesson(s) are worth the inconvenience. Therefore,after receiving an option from the seller to return DVD, I opted to keep the product.

The artist is talented and presents her instruction in a logical and easy to understand manner.",1212883200,10,1083,4.703703703703703
