540792,4,6303052207,"My prayers go out to all the people hurt by this evil man who, for more than a decade, sits on death row in San Quentin.

Harry Hamlin plays a charming and very believable sociopath named Steven David Catlin who killed two of his wives in addition to his adoptive mother and father. It is likely that these murders would not have been solved if not for the heroic and persistent efforts of his third wife. In my opinion, the acting and writing of this movie is very good. You may find yourself talking to the screen trying to warn the unsuspecting victims as Caitlin is killing them.",1386633600,,583,4.398148148148148

540868,2,6303052207,This was too predictable. It was obvious from the beginning what will happen and Harry Hamlin is wasted talent in this one. I watched it because it was a true story but I think I would prefer the book instead.,1476230400,,209,4.25

540870,3,6303052207,"I knew this movie would be borderline at best, and so I only have myself to blame for watching it.  When you have a made-for-TV affair, and you have Harry Hamlin, you know that there will be massive cheese.

And ""Murder So Sweet"" (MSS) is really anything but, although you might get a periodic laugh, here and there.  In particular, after killing one of his wives, the Steve Catlin character, played somewhat convincingly by Mr. Hamlin, gazes into the eyes of the next Mrs. Steve Catlin and confesses, ""I'm so ashamed that I want you so much.""  I started laughing immediately.  But then when he next deadpanned, ""Funny, isn't it?"" I almost lost it.  Yeah, it IS funny.  And somewhat pathetic.

I guess this film is based upon a true story, but I don't know exactly how close to reality it really is.  From what I understand, the real Mr. Catlin is in his 70s now, hanging out at San Quentin Prison -- about an hour or so away from me -- but I haven't yet gone there to pay him a visit.  But if I did, I'd probably be safe.  After all, he's on Death Row, and even more, I guess that he only liked killing women, and I'm a dude.  Whew.

And I won't give much away, but late in the second act or early in the third, we find out WHY Mr. Catlin became such a Misogynist Monster.  I won't give it away, as that would be a real spoiler, but after watching that scene, I thought, ""Yeah.  I'd kill the b---- too.""  Yikes.  Lets just say that Ed Gein and his Bible-thumping Mommy had nothing on Mr. Catlin and his mama.

Well, what's the moral of the story?  I think there are many, but I'll try a couple.  1.  Don't leave Paraquat laying around.  It's bad stuff.  2.  Little boys have clothes that they like to wear, and they don't like being humiliated.  3.  When you look at a film and think, ""This movie will be kinda lame,"" well, listen to that advice.  Because if you don't, after watching, you might feel very ashamed that you watched and STILL almost liked it.",1471478400,,1958,4.278688524590164

The guy would not stop cheating on one wife after another! I hope that the State of California gets rid of him!!!

The excitement is finding out how the case is solved, except in this case there was no excitement. Edie (Helen Shaver) wife # 3 suspected Steve and apparently no one else did when wife 5 died from paraquat poisoning.

The film was slow and boring working hard to create a faux-drama to hold our interest.

541831,3,6303052207,"I both agree and disagree with some of the other reviews posted here. It makes no apologies or tries to hide the fact that it's a low budget made for cable movie, but it is solid and well done enough for such a venture.

Harry Hamlin plays Steve Catlin, a real life killer of the women he's married and his mom. Hamlin himself does a terrific job at creating a character we are invited to openly despise. While the story drags at times like all made for cable movies usually do, we are eventually treated to some excellent scenes between Shaver and Hamlin, with her character's detest of him being a driving force for her stubborn and well founded belief that her ex husband was indeed guilty of killing off his subsequent wives, and her steadfast determination to keep her true feelings under wraps until the District Attorney could be satisfied with enough evidence is played convincingly by Shaver.

The scene where Shaver's character Edie is at his mother's house after she's been discovered to be dead of poisoning is quite good. The nerves are tested with the tension at it's height as she reaches for the gun hidden in her purse.

On the bad side, the musical score is terrible with only a hint now and then of music, and awkwardly placed at that. There are lost opportunities with her son, who has two lines in the whole film. You'll be wondering why wasn't he utilized more as a force to try and prevent her from doing whatever she could to stop Catlin? Instead we get a wooden delivery time and again from her new husband who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.

Still, in spite of the shortcomings, Murder So Sweet is a decent enough romp through the real life drama of a murderous, conniving jerk of a redneck man that you will inevitably think about long after you've finished watching it because it's hard to believe that such evil people really do exist.",1407542400,2,1874,4.519174041297935

541934,4,6303052207,"Well done and entertaining (enough.)  I didn't expect anything stellar, but I doubt the creators of this Lifetime channel type show were out to set the world on fire here.  It's a typical ""rainy Sunday afternoon"" time-passer show.  With that said, it is entertaining in a blase sort of way. Hamlin is excellent as usual and does a great job portraying a psychopath, which is always fun to see (juxtaposed against his L.A. Law character, especially.)  If you have not got a whole heck of a lot to do and want to be mildly but pleasantly entertained, this is pretty good.
