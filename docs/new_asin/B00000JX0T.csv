It's not pretending to be an academic thesis on the subject.

These are light-hearted, engaging, 30-minute glimpses into the lives of our most beloved composers.

Love classical music and want to feel a tiny connection to the composers? Here's a fun way that will likely inspire the musician and ""just listener"" alike to learn more.

Thank you to the producers! Only wish: that there were more episodes!",1415836800,,497,5.024390243902439
8141531,1,B00000JX0T,"I had to write a review of this because it was so disappointing. It's 30 minutes and it only talks about Bolero even though it is supposed to be about his whole life. They talk about how depressing it was that Bolero was his most famous piece, yet they ONLY talk about Bolero and play that one composition during the whole episode. They say how he shouldn't be known for just this one piece, but then only talk about it. They say how Ravel was depressed about this fact yet only they only talk about Bolero. This could have been written by an elementary school student. Don't bother!",1226188800,,583,4.407407407407407
