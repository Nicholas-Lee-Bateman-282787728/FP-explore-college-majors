4902858,5,B005XB8T9K,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this workout DVD. Brooke Burke, as it is obviously known, has an amazing body and proves that she actually works to keep it. What I enjoyed about the exercises is that although they were basic, little modifications made them more effective. I found Brooke very motivating (like working out with a friend), and the trainer was motivating like I would expect a high paid personal trainer to be. I also liked how the DVD is divided into  sections (warm up, upper body, lower body, core, and cool down) so you can pick a certain section or select all categories and do them at once. The three main sections were about 15 minutes each and each exercise is done for a minute to exhaustion. I left this workout with a smile not only because I enjoyed it, but because I know if I continue this DVD the results will follow. Overall, I highly recommend this workout DVD and it will be among  my more rotated (and enjoyable) workouts.",1325462400,79,972,4.517045454545454
4902859,5,B005XB8T9K,"This dvd hurts to complete, in a good way! I bought the dvd because I was so impressed with Brooke's physique, and now I see why! This dvd is TOUGH, and if you continue to do it 3-4x a week, as she recommends, you WILL see results! I bought the physical dvd a few years ago, and just bought the Amazon Video version as well.",1471737600,,324,4.0
4902860,5,B005XB8T9K,Great workout!  Part of my weekly routine.  I like this DVD better when the other DVD she put out at the same time.  Her trainer Gregg is motivating.,1469232000,,149,4.25
4902861,5,B005XB8T9K,"It's one of my fave go to workouts...
Especially when I've fallen off the wagon or just back from vacay!
When I first began this workout I will admit it was tough but it transformed this 40+ body...I started to see definition in my abs and found the coveted ""thigh gap""....
Hello skinny jeans! Give it a try, if you can't do all the moves at least try some instead of none at all...it gets easier! I promise so worth it!",1468540800,3,420,4.197530864197531
4902862,4,B005XB8T9K,"I have many exercise videos but this is my go to video for the best short arms or/and abdominal workout. This video's short 15 minutes routine is easy to follow and very effective and challenging even I use it 2-3x a week. Brook is fun, gorgeous and motivating. I did not give 5 stars because how the way the videos is set up - you have to go through several screens and press the remote selection a number of times in order to get to the workouts.",1465516800,,448,4.160919540229885

The workout is ok, but the pace is just too fast for me, and I'm an intermediate exerciser.  If you're looking for a good 1hr. workout by Brooke, I would recommend getting the Tone & Tighten video within the ""Transform Your Body with Brooke Burke"" series.  It's tough, but at a doable pace and only has Brooke instructing in her usual pleasant manner.",1433462400,,439,4.4625

4902878,5,B005XB8T9K,"OK, I don't LOVE working out but if I have to, this is probably one of my first picks.  Why?  She ISN'T ANNOYING.  Also, I LOVE that you can customize by choosing what you want to do that day (warm-up, upper body, lower body, core, cool down are the choices) and any combination.  PLUS, you can choose with music, instruction, both, or nothing!!  I've never done a video that had that many options.  The whole workout is just over an hour and it really works every muscle group to fatigue.  A great option.",1417478400,2,506,4.376344086021505

4902880,4,B005XB8T9K,"I like this workout, and I have several other Brooke Burke workouts that I like, as well. She definitely does talk nonstop, so I wouldn't go for this DVD if that bothers you during workouts. I find her pleasant, personable and funny. I love the ability to customize workouts, so you can go into the menu and choose from all the options to build exactly the workout you have time for (selecting from Warm-Up, Lower Body, Upper Body, Core and Cool down). There are two reasons I'm not giving this a perfect score. First, Brooke does tend to talk over and interrupt her trainer, which annoys even me (someone who likes her). I wish she'd let him be the guide for proper movement and alignment, when to take breaks, etc, since I presume that his expertise is the reason he's there. Secondly, I cannot stand that she mentions in the upper body workout she's using 2lb weights, and then proceeds to moan and groan about how hard it is. Come on, there is NO WAY she's suffering with such little weights. The trainer, on the other hand, is covered in sweat and seems to be suffering, too.",1413417600,,1080,4.4873096446700504

I found this to be a good leg workout to cross train for my non run days and found the arm workouts to be really effective for buliding small tight muscles but still quite challenging.  I will do the whole workout at once or will do the arm workouts combined with the arm workouts with the strengthen and condidtion if I am doing an upper body workout after running- I use three lb for shoulder, tricep and bicep and 8 lb for back.

The first few times I did it once a week and was sore. It's a really good all around workout. Great squats, abs. And I like that she uses weights so my arms get a workout as well. Many workout videos leave out the arms. I've been doing this video for a few months and don't get tired of it. But you do need to mix up your exercises and exercise videos. Brooke Burke is easy to watch and listen to. And she reminds you that she had four kids while watching her amazing body. I find her inspiring. I've purchased via streaming video and am very happy.",1390003200,,696,4.125

4902894,5,B005XB8T9K,"This has to be one of the best workout tapes I have ever come across. First, I always admired Brooke Burke, so trying out this CD was never a problem. I love her voice and the her general way of talking, so I think she does a great job in talking through her workout. Explaining each move, and really motivates you to finish. I love how challenging each move is without being crazy hard to do. Completing the entire workout in one sitting will give you one pretty intense cardio /fat burning workout, without needing to jump up and down and do manic moves like other fitness trainers make you do. I live in a apartment, so I love that I can  do this workout without disturbing any downstairs neighbors with floor vibrations.

Definitely recommend that everyone try this workout. A good tip, I do with any type of work out video is to check out your local library, to see  if they carry the video you want to try. If they do, try at home and see if you really like it and that it suits what you are looking for before you invest in buying the actual video.  I bought this video by streaming, which really is the best way to go. DVD's never really work for me, cause they freeze up or get damaged easily.",1381968000,3,1202,4.258771929824562
4902895,5,B005XB8T9K,"You can choose your work out or do the entire video.  Starts slow, but by the end, you're really feeling the burn.  Brooke Burke is great, makes some weird breathing noises, but besides that the video is great.",1379808000,,210,4.5
4902896,5,B005XB8T9K,"In this CD Brook really works it and you get the feeling she's really there for you and wants to share her experience of workout with you to help you achieve your goals.  It works you out too!
The only thing is that the last time I played it, maybe I touched something wrong but it only played in black and white.  Can't figure that out.

4902899,5,B005XB8T9K,I started this workout routine 4-5 weeks after having my baby girl. It was easy to do in my living room and if I didn't have a lot of time I can break the workouts into 20-30 min portions throughout the week. Brooke has some of the best low impact work outs that I've tried and I've done many different routines. Love it.,1375056000,,321,4.111111111111111
4902900,4,B005XB8T9K,"this is a really wonderful exercise video.. however; you need to be properly warmed up and stretched in order to not injure yourself. the warm up that comes with the video is not sufficient to really get those muscles really limber. the cool down also leaves a lot to be desired. other than that, the work out part  of the video is phenomenal.",1374364800,2,343,4.444444444444445

4902907,4,B005XB8T9K,"Transform Your Body with Brooke Burke is a good (not great) workout.  I prefer Brooke's style of coaching over being yelled at by Jillian Michaels, but you will burn a few more calories in the same amount of time with Jillian's Shed to Shred (I just pop in my earbuds and mute her).

But really, I just wanted to share the stats for a frame of reference, if anyone else needed it.

*At 119lbs; times are estimates only; calories burned are if my HRM (Polar FT4) is to be trusted:

Bad things: Brooke makes weird noises while exercising such as ""shshshs"", and the music should be more active; nonetheless it has the option voice without music so I can play my music while doing the exercises.

It makes you feel like you doing cardio....it has that kind of a feel to it, esp. when you do the leg section. Great workout. Definately something I would consider  purchasing or requesting on my Xmas list! It does allow you to just pick one section of it as well. The only downer is the warm up....I can't even call it a warm up. I thought it is widely known by now that you don't stretch the cold body! Jillian Michaels offers amazing warm ups.

4902923,3,B005XB8T9K,"I usually avoid celebrity workouts, but after reading some reviews of this one, I though it might work for me.  It features entertainer Brooke Burke--who admittedly has an amazing body, even after FOUR children--working out with personal trainer Greg Joujon-Roche.  The DVD has some nice features, as there are three separate workouts (for lower body, upper body, and core) of approximately 15 minutes each, and a customizable feature allowing you to create your own workout

Brooke and Greg work out in a nice, open-air building with exposed brick which looks onto a patio.  The music is upbeat but not obtrusive; however, the DVD also offers a music-off option.  I have provided a brief overview of each segment below.

WARM-UP (4.5 minutes)
Brooke leads this segment.  It consists solely of static stretches with NO aerobic/dynamic warm-up, which is completely contra-indicated by modern exercise theory.  The stretches WOULD be nice as a cool-down; they include neck stretches, shoulder rolls, forward hang, inner thigh stretch, hamstring stretch, and quad stretch.

For the strength portion, Greg leads, sometimes exercising along with Brooke, sometimes simply directing her.  All exercises are performed in 1 minute drills (or 30 seconds per side).  Greg and Brooke begin with unweighted (body weight only) moves and then use dumbbells; Brooke states that she is using 2-lb. weights.

LOWER BODY (15.5 minutes)
The unweighted moves include a back cross lunge, lunge to toe tap, back lunge to hop, squat swimmers, squat hops, and squat lunges (aka around the world lunges).  They use dumbbells for one move only in this workout:  v-ups, a sort of a wide-legged deadlift.  They then return to unweighted moves for reverse snap kick lunge, down dog kickbacks (Brooke takes off her shoes for these), and two moves on all fours, bent knee lifts and hydrants.

UPPER BODY (18 minutes)
Greg and Brooke again start with an unweighted exercise, here with a boxing move.  Next comes an outside bicep curl to a military press and then a plie with alternating front raise.  A ""triple scoop"" further works the shoulders, and then Brooke and Greg drop to their knees.  From this position, they perform chest flys, shoulder pulses, triceps kickbacks (on hands and knees), another set of shoulder pulses, and ""salt and pepper"" (an elevated bicep curl).  Greg then has Brooke come down to the floor for ""down dog"" (actually UP dog) moving into standing forward bend.  They finish with triceps dips and presses and a plank move called the Brazilian twist.

CORE (16 minutes)
The majority of this workout consists of traditional crunches.  Moves include ""roll-ups"" (upper body crunches), reverse crunch, dead bug, reverse bicycle, lower abs squeeze, ballerina scissors, and wide leg rope pull.  Next comes several plank moves, including a held elbow plank and a rotating plank.  Then Greg has Brooke return to her back for a few final exercises, including see-saw, accordion crunch, and oblique choppers, a pulsing move.

COOL-DOWN (2.5 minutes)
This was an odd section, as it was basically a shortened version of the warm-up:  Brooke runs through almost the exact same static stretches.  However, she skips most of the lower body stretches and adds down dog with a calf stretch at the end.

Overall, I found this DVD to be disappointing.  For one thing, given the supposed strength/toning focus, I had expected more weights work, so I was disappointed that the dumbbells were so under-utilized, especially in the lower body workout.  I did find Brooke to be generally likeable--she comes across as fairly real, even taking breaks at times--yet she can also be annoying, constantly repeating the phrase ""one minute of madness!""  In addition, she simply does not seem very knowledgeable about exercise--this is most typified by the fact that she includes static stretches in the warm-up prior to properly preparing the body.  The shorter workout segments on this DVD are nice, and I can certainly see how it would appeal to some, but overall, I don't recommend it.",1352160000,4,4050,5.115677321156773

I have Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones dvd and this is exactly what happens during this routine, even though there is no cardio.

I did leave the dvd running, while I did my own routine. She does have some new moves that I have not seen before but otherwise this dvd was very disappointing.

Brooke is a good instructor, she walks the walk, and is very easy to follow.  I've noticed a difference after a week of using it and I'm still working my way up to the more advanced level.

It's Wednesday (same week), but the back and front of my legs are still killing me!  I guess I worked areas of my leg that I had never before.  The dvd is very slow, but apparently effective.  You do each exercise for one minute.  I didn't think it was that effective when I was doing it.  I was surprised when I started to sweat and even more surprised by the pain in my legs the next morning.  I don't do the stretches.  They look very complicated, and I'm not that flexible.  The ab series is very hard.  I like that it's not boring.  I'll probably continue to do this dvd once a week max.  Overall, it's effective, enjoyable, and mildly challenging.

I got through the warm up and lower body (the first 30 mins or so) and wow, am I sore today (but in a good way.)  This workout is much slower paced than I would have thought but there are so many lunges and squats that it really does get the heart pumping.  I had to do a modified version a couple of times and had to pause the DVD once to catch my breath but so far I LOVE the workout!  I like that the exercises only last for a minute each!  And she counts down at 10 seconds so you know there isn't too much more to go. Like I said, I only did half the workout so far but it seems very effective.  Brooke Burke is is phenomenal shape, I think we would all agree, but she is humble about how she got there and reminds you that the workout was hard for her in the beginning!  I really like her personality - motivational without being cheesy.  And the music isn't bad either, you hardly notice it.  I love that you can customize your workouts too, although I haven't tried that yet.  I'll need to make it through the whole thing first :)  All in all a great workout DVD!

This is NOT an easy/beginners workout. I can only do about 2 out of 3 of the segments so far at one time, but I can feel and see a difference after one week. There are some advanced moves that require a few times to master, but overall, I think this is a great intermediate level workout.

I had been paying for personal trainers or expensive pilates classes and am thrilled you only need this and a pair of light weights (2-3 pounds each) to get the job done.

4902938,5,B005XB8T9K,"I HATE exercising. I was so overweight and out of shape I felt hopeless. I searched for a workout DVD that had good reviews and I chose this one.

The first time I did this workout I threw up afterwards!  The second time I didn't throw up, but I was totally spent. I had a hard time even keeping up with the modifications. I was scared bc I couldn't even do the stretches in the warm up.

That was almost 3 months ago. I have lost 37 lbs since then! I can do all moves and am no longer only doing the modifications.  I'm covered in sweat at the end of the workout, and I can feel my body changing, just like Brooke says throughout the workout. Just yesterday I noticed that I was actually doing push ups! I can't remember the last time I could actually do a legit push up!

I've been dieting along with walking, bike riding and this DVD, but the toning I'm experiencing is all thanks to Brooke Burke. I NEVER imagined I would be an exercising person, but this workout has definitely changed my outlook.  I still have a long way to go, but at least I'm finally enjoying the ride!",1341705600,26,1078,4.183574879227053
4902939,4,B005XB8T9K,"I am a daily exerciser, who does pilates, yoga, kickboxing and dance work-outs but am trying more and more of my least favorite workouts, which are the weighted toning workouts....why?  Well, I'm in Brooke's demo, over 40 and am in good shape now and don't want to lose that.  I want to build and keep my muscle tone, and unfortunately, a balanced workout of many different types is needed, including weighted workouts to build and keep bone mass. So, on the ""fun"" factor, this one is ""ok"", it is basically a challenging workout for the intermediate exerciser.  If you are a beginner, or significantly overweight I would recommend starting slow....start light with the weights (Brooke herself is using 2 lb weights) or do the reps with no weights to start.  Do as many of the reps as you are able with good form and then rest.  In a day or two try it again and try to do a few more reps.  This is how you build up to doing a workout like this.  Seven years ago I was 40 lbs. heavier, and had to build up my endurance and these are still my most challenging types of exercises.

Brooke's personal trainer assists her in this nearly 60 minute workout.  One of the nice things is that the workout is programmable so you can customize.  I did all segments, but you could do a 5 minute warm-up and a 15 minute lower body, 18 minute arm workout or the 16 minute core segment and then cool down for about 3 minutes of light stretching.  It is up to you.  If you are starting out try the lower body, but beware if you have knee issues....there are lots of lunges, squats and some jumping. You do all exercises for 1 minute only.  Sounds easy?  Yeah, not so much....effective?  Yes, I already have that wiggly muscle feeling, but that means I worked it, so I'm happy.

Drawbacks?  Well, you might want to check out a video clip on collage video to see if her instruction style is for you....She didn't bother me, I liked the motivational vibe and the fact that it didn't seem like a cakewalk for her either, but some prefer a more direct and tough approach.  I find I gravitate more to this style of Jackie Warner than Jillian Michaels, but that is a style preference only, all three show great form, good cuing and excellent exercises to burn fat and get you in shape (or keep you there). Pick the style that works best for you and you are much more likely to stick with the instructor and exercises.
My cons were at the beginning of the dvd-neck rolls.....I have always been instructed that circling your head all the way around is not especially good for the neck vertebra so I do not choose to do that-I just tilt my head to the other side instead of rolling it instead, also when she cues at the beginning she is saying to go to the left or the right but it is her left or right, not yours.  Nothing major....

Overall, a good workout for an intermediate exerciser, programmable so you can choose the target and length of your workout and both Brooke & Greg instruct with an eye for good form and have a motivating style.",1341619200,3,3017,4.372759856630824

Otherwise, the workout was fine.  But, if you pull a muscle during the warm up, the rest will be a waste.

I didn't really like the timed sets.  Why not do a good exercise to muscle failure then go on to the next?  That's just me being picky.  The last negative is that the upper body really got gypped.  Not much time at all strengthening those muscles.

Make sure your muscles are warm before you start this one!",1338422400,2,590,4.388888888888889

Brooke Burke wisely has here trainer with her on the dvd, I say wisely because while you are doing the workout....she is doing the workout!  The trainer does a great job of keeping you on track!  The idea is to repeat one movement for one minute, leading to the exhaustion of the muscle....and it works.  There is a short warm-up and cool down but really this dvd is about the upper and lower body segments, both 20 minutes a piece, there is an ab section but I rarely use it because I work out my abs on cardio day.  However, the few times I have used the ab section it has been Oh My Goodness effective!  I like that I can program the work-out to include warm-up, lower body, upper body, and cool down....no need to skip sections.  I will say this, I had to work up to doing this work out multiple times per week....it can be tough for someone new to this type of workout.  I know some reviewers say that it isn't hard enough quickly enough....but I think that is the point, this is a great overall workout someone can work UP to.....I could follow the entire process from the first time...and I sweat A LOT after I am done!",1336867200,,1291,4.215447154471545

I enjoy her personality, however she seems a bit ditzy.  For example, in the beginning stretches she talks about stretching your hamstrings, however the stretch she was doing was for your quads.  She also says the phrase ""Listen to your body"" way too much.  Also refers to some guy ""greg"" throughout the video which was a little weird.",1336348800,,720,4.218978102189781

However, the arms and abs were super tough, I felt the burn for the whole day after doings it, and loved it. Those alone will definitely give you that lean definition.  I wish the leg part was as intense, it would be a great whole piece.  But the good news is that you can excess different chapters without having to forward to the separate parts.  I also kind of liked how they both worked together, it almost feels like working with a personal trainer.

The setting is relaxing, Brooke is encouraging but not annoying, making it an easy workout to go through over and over. My only beef is that the upper body could be a bit longer.

I feel like it's a good balance to keep your heart rate up but not make you want to fall over from exhaustion. I thought the dvd went at a good pace and really does work every muscle you have in your body. I got through the whole dvd and loved how my body felt. Burning and like jello but a good kind of burn (as Brooke would say)

Also, Brooke was a great motivator. I found myself smiling on more than one occasion as she tried to push you to continue the workout.

Brooke was also great at showing you how to do each move. On some moves they even showed her at a different angle to really help you understand how to do the movement.

The only thing I didn't like, as some people have already mentioned, was the modifications. Most of the modifications were not mentioned untill 30-40 seconds into the routine. I personally didn't mind all that much because the regular routine wasn't all that difficult for me but for someone getting into shape who needs that modification it might be irritating. Plus, it doesn't look too professional to ahve to remind your backup to do a modification.

Aside from that though, I love love love this dvd. I'm definitly going to be adding this into my rotation for exercise dvds. I don't know if from this dvd alone you could get scuplted like Brooke but I'm willing to find out.",1334793600,2,1460,4.352941176470588

4902962,3,B005XB8T9K,"I tried really hard to like it. She kept talking about how hard it would be and how one should push themselves through it. So I expected an intense workout. The warmup was just stretching. I guess I'm used to Jillian Michaels and Insanity warm ups where they get your heart rate up during the warm up.

I really hoped it would be as hard as she was saying. But her movements were so slow I went faster then her to get a good workout. And she took too long of rests. I couldn't get past the first twenty minutes of this DVD. Usually the first ten to fifteen minutes in I'm sweating up a storm. And I'm usually so into a workout I don't even realize I'm working out.

I think this DVD is more for beginners. If you like intense workouts like me try insanity, Jillian Michaels: no more trouble zone, 6 week 6 pack level 2, Bob Harpers total body transformation or ChaLean Extreme Burn Intervals.

I thought that this DVD was intro workout to prepare people for the workout DVDs I mentioned above.",1333411200,3,993,4.2994652406417115

I find most to be too basic or to feature too much jumping around which makes me feel stupid.  This dvd targets those hard to get areas with a smooth flow from one move to the next.  Brooke demonstrates this without the silly jumping around nonsense which can also damage knees with time.  I can feel it all over the next day.  The core is a killer!  It's my goal to master that.  Ok, just to keep up would be good!  This is a good work out dvd for all levels.  I can't wait to buy her other one!",1333238400,5,611,3.894308943089431

The moves are tough, although modifications are shown, but for only an hour each day you can literally feel your body start to change.

I was so sore from several days of hard workouts that when I saw this DVD at the store this morning, I decided to buy it thinking this would be a light workout and that it would be easier on me due to my aching muscles needing a ""light"" workout...Oh, wow! Did I ever underestimate this workout! It was really challenging and I loved every moment of it. It was exciting and both Brooke and her trainer were so encouraging. Even though I am overweight and about to turn 47, I was able to do just about everything on this DVD...the only thing I had to go ahead and give up on were the planks during the Core workout because my stomach is large and weighed me down :( I look forward to being able to do this part eventually as I shrink even more. I think this is an awesome workout and the perfect amount of repetitions....a welcome change from Billy Blanks making me hold a push-up for an eternity and Viveca Jensen making my butt feel like it was burning off from doing what seems like an eternity of repetitions!

I am a biginner now, however, I used to workout everyday and was in really good shape.  After my two kids, I lost track of taking care of my body. I am on the road to success again with this video. I am so happy that I bought it.  I have literally, a library of the most popular videos for getting in shape.  None I have really do the trick like this one does.  Brooke and her trainer are so good at keeping me motivated and trying my hardest.  I know the hard work and dedication it takes in order to look really good and feel really good.

4902976,5,B005XB8T9K,"I will start by saying this is my first online review of any product, ever.  But I really like this video enough to want to share my opinion.  I own a lot of workout DVDs such as several by The Firm, Mitch Gaylord Melt it Off, Jillian Michaels and some kettlebell workouts.  This workout really is a great blend of challenging but doable.  Each exercise is done for a max of one minute, so even when they are tough, when you know it is one minute, you can push through it.  Brooke is not annoying at all.  And those of you who do other videos know exactly what I mean by this.  some instructors are just too annoying to listen to time and time again.  She also demonstrates each move before it begins.  This is one complaint I have about The Firm.  I do wish the music was a little more upbeat, and have the moves go to the beat.  And the total length is about an hour.  It is tough to find a full hour, but you can do just certain parts of the workout if you are short on time.  I have not been doing the video long enough to see results yet (2 weeks total, 2-3 times a week), but I have plenty of videos that I have tried and shelved after just a few times but this is one I will stick with as I do enjoy it, as much as exercise can be ""enjoyed"".

4902987,4,B005XB8T9K,"I bought this dvd based on the reviews and because am a big fan of Brooke Burkes - her body is amazing so I wanted to check out how she supposedly does it.  Ok, sorry but it's not this workout alone by any means - not after four kids LOL.

The workout itself isn't bad, the time went by pretty quickly and I wasn't bored...I just wasn't pushed that hard either.  I have every Jillian Michaels dvd and along with every Jackie Warner dvd, and this is DEFINITELY not as hard.

One thing I really did not enjoy was the two longish periods of stretching in the middle of the dvd [a few minutes each time but you literally stop working out, go to the floor, and start stretching] - I mean come on, stretching is for the beginning and the end of a workout - how can you keep your heart rate up if you're stopping mid-way to stretch more than once in a 40 minute video?  That kind of killed it for me.  I fast forwarded the stretch sections but honestly, how is this inter/adv if you stop to do sections of full stretches?

The squat section was pretty good and the ab section was great but other than that, I wouldn't choose this over Jillian's NMTZ by any means or if I want a really solid workout - this is more for beginner/intermediate.

The other issue is the modifications, if you are trying to get in shape and need/want to use modifications, you might have some trouble with this - BB does each move for a minute and doesn't really show you a modification until about 30 - 40 seconds into the move - sometimes she actually had to remind the person to actually show a modification...

I still gave it four stars because it isn't bad, I just don't believe her when she says this was all she did to get her body back after four kids...must be some ridiculous metabolism...if you want a decent workout then get this.  I really enjoyed the setting [warehouse, garden scene outside].  Brooke Burke has a lot of energy and she is motivating, she counts you down on most moves in the last 10 seconds which as nice and again, the abs series was really great.

Brooke will not stop talking over her trainer, Greg, during this workout.  He starts telling you how to have proper form and she interrupts and starts talking about how she can feel the burn or other things.  He even starts talking louder and over her at some points in order to be heard.  Usually these things don't bother me, but it went on throughout the entire video, it was so annoying.  Also her over emphasis on breathing was a bit much for me.  If you can get over these annoying parts (or turn off the instruction and just listen to the music), this isn't a bad workout.",1329091200,2,689,4.3858267716535435

I consider myself to be in fairly good shape but so far I've done this three times and I'm sore every time!  It is challenging but not so extreme I can't do the moves for a minute(well, most of them!).  I also got her other video, Strength and Condition, and I actually like this one better.

This workout is only moderately challenging but Brooke takes lots of breaks anyway. She didn't get super skinny doing this workout (hello genetics and diet!) Some of the moves are unique and different, so I'll give her that.

Brooke is annoying.  She tells you to keep going but then quits herself because it's too hard. I kept thinking she really had no business giving me fitness advice.

Then the warmup is all stretches, which is definitely against conventional wisdom of dynamic stretching until you are fully warmed up.

I loved the location, the music and the way instruction is given. I appreciate that Brooke does the entire workout herself instead of standing around shouting instructions or talking like some instructors do in workout videos.

First, it's really hard to get into any dvd that is set in a bright white studio with outdated music to try and keep motivated. This dvd is set in a modern loft with beautiful background and relaxing music. Second, each exercise is in 1 minute increments and like she says multiple times throughout the video, you can do anything for a minute. There are stretches in between each set which give you alittle break but do not mistake this for it being easy or not working...you definitely feel the burn!

This will be my DVD to use once a week in rotation with kickboxing, yoga, tribal belly dancing, and whatever I throw in the mix this year.  I suggest getting this DVD.  Use it as a whole body tone up or as they say in kundalini whole body tune up.  I feel present.  The instructor Brooke Burke is present in her intentions.  She really made an excellent workout and has realness.  It is conveyed throughout.  Better than Jillian Michaels and Supreme 90.  I enjoyed my workout and it is true...I can do a lot in one minute.  I needed the overhaul.  You will need hand weights, and mat for floor movements if you are not on carpet or to help with the transitions.  Have water and there are plenty of mentions to breathe and take these water breaks in the DVD.  Serious workout.

Looking forward to seeing results from her videos!,1326931200,6,408,4.611111111111111
4903007,5,B005XB8T9K,LOVING this workout DVD.  Brooke is so encouraging throughout the whole video.  So many home workout dvd's are annoying to listen to or watch but not the case with her.  I love that she does the whole workout with you and acknowledges that it's tough for her too.  I did P90X for 2 years and was definitely ready for a change.  I love that these workouts are geared towards women but still super tough.  I have recommended to SO many of my friends already and will continue to do so.,1326931200,2,483,4.311111111111111
4903008,5,B005XB8T9K,"I'm not familiar with Brooke Burke, but I saw ads for this workout dvd in Shape magazine and wanted to try it.  Loved this workout.  She gives great direction and she's NOT annoying.  I liked the different moves she introduced.  I workout regularly and worked up a little sweat with this.  This video reminded me of Gunnar Petersons workout dvd from Shape; another fun workout dvd that gets results.  The ab portion was the most challenging.  Buy this dvd for a great well rounded workout.",1326758400,8,489,4.682352941176471
4903009,5,B005XB8T9K,"I usually hate doing work out DVDs because I get bored very easily. I saw Brooke on Live with Kelly and they showed some of the moves in the DVD and I decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it! I run 5 days a week for cardio and do this workout video 3 days a week. I have done it 4 times and I already feel stronger! It is just enough to compliment my cardio sessions. It is definitely a tough lower body workout. The upper body is challenging, but only if you have weights. The core was very tough and I enjoyed the variety of moves! I would recommend this to anyone!",1326672000,5,575,3.9655172413793105
4903010,5,B005XB8T9K,"I love that I got to try it before I buy it here on Amazon for $1.99! I saw Brooke on tv talking about her workout DVDs and was intrigued, but didn't want to waste money on something I would probably workout to one time. So yesterday I got the pre-view and did the 45 minute workout and LOVED it! Finally a video where the host actually explains and shows you the next move. Since each move was for a minute, I was able to give it my all knowing I wouldn't be doing endless reps. The modifications were also very nice. I also like the fact that you aren't jumping around every five minutes picking up weights, putting together a step mechanism, or doing some dance move. There is no weird music in the background and it is very well produced. Other exercise videos should take notes! I highly recommend this! Can't wait to get home and work out again tonight...and I've NEVER said that before! Buy it, you won't be disappointed!",1326412800,11,928,4.369942196531792
4903011,5,B005XB8T9K,This is a great work out for full body! It's nice because it is in sections so you can do legs in the morning and arms at night or do all together for a full body workout. I love how you feel like you are working out with Brooke and she keeps you motivated. Also you can see her struggle with the workout and it makes you do it more because it shows it's not easy. It progresses fast so you don't get bored and before you know it the workout is done and trust me you will feel it next day. Overall just a great workout that's quick and fun to do!,1326412800,6,546,3.84070796460177
4903012,5,B005XB8T9K,"In the ""Tone & Tighten"" DVD (with the blue cover), Brooke Burke instructs in a challenging and moderately-paced workout.  I enjoyed her pleasant personality which includes her confidence and bright smile, as well as the nice surroundings of the garden and warehouse setting.

Ms. Burke works with two other ladies, and one does modifications so this DVD is a little easier than the other DVD from Ms. Burke.  Some may consider this an intermediate, or if you follow the modifier, possibly a beginner's workout.  In addition, stretches are integrated within the total workout, so beginners have time to recover.

Each exercise is about 1 minute and light dumbbells are used.  If you don't have dumbbells, that is fine too.

Total time (61:24) Do the whole workout or choose which body part to work.

Warm up (5:23) Stretches and light work
Lower body (26:53) Contains upper body work too
Upper body (7:55) Very short

4903013,5,B005XB8T9K,"Brooke Burke's ""Strengthen & Condition"" (with the pink cover) is a series of dynamic and challenging exercises. I highly enjoyed this excellent workout.  I also enjoyed the production, training, motivation, demonstration, and the variety of exercises.  I think it's a five stars plus intermediate workout.

Both Ms. Burke and Greg Joujon-Roche, the personal trainer, are clearly enjoying themselves and are enthusiastic in sharing their routines, which made me enjoy the exercises more myself.  Mr. Joujon-Roche is notable in his training and motivation and he works well with Ms. Brooke.  The setting is a warehouse and pretty garden.

This intermediate DVD is a little more intense than Ms. Burke's other companion DVD, ""Tone & Tighten"".  I also liked this DVD a little bit more than the other one.

Each exercise is about 1 minute and there's usually a few seconds rest between each exercise.  Ms. Burke uses two pounds, while Mr. Joujon-Roche uses slightly heavier dumbbells.

Here's the chapter outline.  You may complete the whole workout as I did or choose which segments to do.

Total time (55:46)

Warm up (4:39) This is made of light exercises and stretches.
Lower body (15:28) This contains quite a bit of jumping.

4903014,5,B005XB8T9K,"I really have nothing bad to say about this video. It's a great workout that targets your legs, stomach and arms in a quick 45 minutes. I needed another workout video to mix in with my current regimen of running and Tracey Anderson videos. I still love my T.A. Videos, but this allows me to mix up my routine and work different muscles. I think this would be great for someone who's trying to get back into shape. Brooke is good at pushing you and it's sweet how she acts like it's strenuous for her just so us normal people feel better about struggling through it.",1326240000,,565,4.339622641509434
4903015,5,B005XB8T9K,"I have just done this workout for the first time this morning and I absolutely loved it! It was definitely very challenging, particularly the abs segment so I definitely have some work to do to before I can get thru this workout with anywhere near the poise that Brooke does. This workout can be scaled up or down based on the weight that you use and how much you put into each move so it should provide a good challenge for an advanced exerciser but also can work for someone not at that level.

The whole production is top notch! Brooke does a perfect job of demonstrating the moves, which are all simple to execute but challenging in themselves, she talks you thru each ""minute of madness"", as she calls it, in an encouraging way without being at all annoying. The set is a gorgeous warehouse/ garden setting and Brooke is such a perfect picture of health and fitness that you are completely inspired to stay in the moment and finish out each ""minute"".

I plan to alternate this and the corresponding Tone & Tighten workout with days of running thru the end of February. I'm confident that this workout will deliver results and will update my review once I finish this round.

I really love the style of this workout and I sincerely hope that she and Greg, the trainer, have more on the way. Brooke is so down to earth and inspiring that she could do enormous things in this direction of health, fitness and lifestyle. Fingers crossed that they have more in the works!",1326240000,5,1471,4.50187265917603
4903016,5,B005XB8T9K,I just got my DVD yesterday and tried it last night.  I work out a lot so I was a bit skeptical that it would do anything for me but it totally kicked my butt!  I had to pause multiple times during the squat series to catch my breath and she does some untraditional plank variations that I really liked.  I'm going to add this to my workout rotation for the next few months and see what kind of results I get!,1325721600,31,409,3.9634146341463414

4903018,5,B005XB8T9K,"This workout is tough! I usually workout using Jillian Michael workout dvds and I think they are very effective, however I so appreciate the fact that Brooke has a pleasant personality, and does the entire workout with you. Nice clear picture, and great scenery. The warm up and cool down were a little ackward for me but I hope to improve my balance with time. There were several workout moves I have never done before that I enjoyed. I had to hit the pause button several times and yet she makes the entire workout seem fun, graceful and easy! Its not easy in any manner! I was sweating within the first 10 minutes. You also have the option of music plus instructor, or only one of them. You can break this down into segments if you are short on time or do the entire workout. I tried this once and was begging for the hour to be over, but I know I got my $$$ worth on this investment and plan to continue using this dvd with the hopes it gets a little easier each time. I may never have Brooke Burke's amazing body but I do appreciate the fact that she works hard to maintain it and her workout dvd gives me encouragement to do the same to improve mine!",1325635200,69,1156,4.235294117647059

8488552,5,B005XB8T9K,"I started working out again by purchasing the Strengthen and Condition DVD, plus the 30 Day Slim Down and I've been alternating between the two DVD's for about 4-5 weeks now. They were really challenging at first, and I am just now after a few weeks getting to the point where I can finish each exercise without having to take a pause. I like Brooke's style and her direction, plus on the Strengthen and Condition DVD, her personal trainer is also directing and I like him. After almost 5 weeks of working out 6 days a week, (1 day of rest) and totally changing my diet, I can see a change in my body. My slacks and pants are fitting looser and I went jeans shopping this past weekend I am down 1 inch in my waist. I'm not overweight and didn't start this routine to lose weight, I just wanted to tone and tighten and overall get in better physical shape, but I will take it! I can definitely tell a difference! But you have to remember, you have to change your eating habits as well, and watch your calories, or no amount of exercise or working out will produce any results. I just purchased Brooke's other DVD, Tone and Tighten, to add to my workout regime...so I hope to continue seeing results!",1513123200,,1198,4.352678571428571

8488555,3,B005XB8T9K,"This DVD is getting a lot of five star reviews but as someone who is certified as a personal trainer, I want to warn you about some parts of this video.  First, neck rolls are so 20 years ago.  You never put your head back (that's what happens with whiplash) and I can't believe Brooke's trainer still has her doing what went out of fashion ages ago.  Don't put your head back.  Please.

Also, where's the warm up?  You need several minutes of rhythmic movement to warm up the muscles but Brooke (after rolling her head around) goes right into stretching cold muscles.  Stretching cold muscles can lead to injury.  I'm not faulting Brooke for this.  Like Radu with Cindy Crawford, this is on the trainer.

Also, one minute to do a lot of these exercises is way too long because it not only becomes monotonous but you tend to lose your form because your muscles become fatigued.  30 seconds would have been a much better time frame.

During the core section, Brooke spends way too much time in plank positions.  The problem with that is that it becomes harder and harder to hold your abs in as they tire and then your back comes into play causing potential injury.

Take out the neck rolls, warm up before stretching and when you feel yourself losing your form, I would recommend marching in place until the next routine.  Don't feel like you have to compete with Brooke.",1500854400,6,1370,4.512195121951219
