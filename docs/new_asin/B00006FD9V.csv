7967711,5,B00006FD9V,"this came just as i would have hoped. in great condition. i love this series. it is funny, but i prefer the english subbed over the english dubbed. the dubbed voices are hilariously bad in places. the english subbed though is excellent",1389398400,,235,4.619047619047619
7967712,3,B00006FD9V,"Well, I have to say not bad at all. But the first one is better.
It turns out Zenki has a BROTHER!!(the one on the cover)His name is Goki. An totaly nice, nothing like little Zenki. Together they make Zenki's true form come out...Two new pepole are introduced: a Chika with a gun(kinda [cranky]) and her boss. Suhma(the guy with the beads) only comes out like for 15 seconds and then leaves. .... Pertty cool but it felt boring and rushed at times. If your a true fan...you might scream bloody hell out of fustration the might throw it out of the window saying why the hell did I buy this!!!Once your calm down you'll run to it and pop it back in for round2. I really give it 3 1/2 stars.",1039478400,,688,4.21969696969697
