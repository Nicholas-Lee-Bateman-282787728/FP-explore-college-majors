8339219,4,B001RXB4KO,"You really need to have a strong stomach for Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! Honestly, I love it. It's generally in the style of the worst of 1980's public access meeting the minds of two very talented comedy writers. You'll laugh. You won't cry, except from laughing. You'll gag a little. Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! is a good time.",1404864000,,349,4.46875

8339222,5,B001RXB4KO,"In my mind there are only a handful of television shows (at present and historically) that are this good and this original, but even so every time I see a new episode of Tim & Eric I'm lost on what I just saw.  It takes me multiple viewings to eventually like it, get it, or find it funny.  But the vast majority of episodes I do eventually appreciate.

What else can I say that everyone else who appreciates it will?  It's an 11 minute show with various, short scenarios and mostly incomplete scenes.  There is no fixed formula episode to episode though characters do recur.  Public access television shows, local news, and commercials are interspersed sometimes with a longer story, though the story will usually not fully complete or ultimately make sense.  This is true deadpan which often is the best comedy (Buster Keaton & Steven Wright fans should enjoy it).  In fact if a sub-genre of comedy other than deadpan is used, it is actually that sub-genre under attack, making that otherwise non-funny comedy funny.  For example the show rarely uses tired, cliched jokes unless the use of that cliched joke is the actual joke.

Some scenes intend to make you uncomfortable and sometimes downright disgusted.  Most scenes have multiple layers of comedy (often sight comedy) which may be the reason it often takes me multiple viewings to finally get on board.  It's non-political.  (However there are a few anti-establishment jabs at times especially when characters like Billy Crystals and Whoopsie Goldberg appear.)  The cast is Tim and Eric as multiple characters in each episode.  Guest appearances are some of the most well known (good) comedians/comics.  Relative unknowns (Richard Dunn/David Hart and others) and many truly unknown actors, however, really make it a show like no other.

I think overall what I like most about Tim and Eric is that the final product feels like the result of two comedians freely creating and expressing their own brand of humor.  And even though we are supposed to live in a free society this is a very rare situation.  Media may or may not be officially controlled or regulated, but look at what you normally get.  Does it really feel free or natural.  Most of what you are fed is homogenized predictable, safe and fake.  At least Tim and Eric aren't.  Someone once said that nowadays the sheep herd themselves, and I don't think they are wrong.  (But we all have to earn money so I'll stop it there.)

As for the best comedy shows in history I rank this up in my varied list of favorites including Dick Van Dyke, Seinfeld, Mr. Show, and Get Smart.  Maybe add the Office (UK) to that list as well.",1252022400,,2638,4.730263157894737
8339223,5,B001RXB4KO,This show is just unbelievably funny and good.  I hope Tim and Eric are around for a long time doing what they do and I hope they continue the show.  This DVD is money well spent because you will laugh until you cry.,1243296000,,216,4.0
8339224,5,B001RXB4KO,"It's almost impossible to classify Tim and Eric's show, which, at eleven minutes per episode, is mindbogglingly funny. A hodge-podge of parodied instructional videos, sing-a-longs, and infomercials, are paired with recurring characters, bizarre bits of intentionally bad editing, and a few cast members who, based solely on their behavior on screen, don't seem to be in on the joke. Rarely do you see two men who take such full advantage of their less than perfect bodies. Tim and Eric regularly cram themselves into absurdly small outfits, in order to portray shrimp and white wine obsessed club goers the Beaver boys, vaseline-faced singer Casey Tatum and his brother, or any number of hilarious characters. Not since Monty Python, have two men seemed so at home in drag. A number of skits require either Tim or Eric to portray a female, often the love interest of the other, and the result is side-splitting. The show also features a consistent deluge of wonderful cameos from comic greats such as Fred Willard, Zach Galifianakis, Will Forte, John C. Reilly, The Lonely Island guys, and Brett and Jemaine from Flight of the Conchords, among others.",1243123200,,1151,5.063157894736842
