8447321,5,B004XQO8BE,"This is a tragedy in the fullest sense of the term. A harrowing story of a man driven to become what he despises. The film depicts the epidemic poverty of Iran and the malignant underground trade in blood that this desperate community fosters. Saeed Kangarani delivers a smashing performance as an idealistic young man turned criminal. Bangarani is the force that makes this movie as powerful as it is. Once seen, his perfomance cannot be forgotten easily. A great movie that packs a punch.",1337558400,,490,4.845238095238095
