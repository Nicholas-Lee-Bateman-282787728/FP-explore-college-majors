643357,5,6303430953,"In the Hasty Heart Richard Todd gives a great performance as Lachy, a stubborn, proud young Scot soldier dying of kidney failure due to a wound received in battle in Burma in 1945 - days after the end of the war.  Lachy isn't told he's dying, but the other patients in the army hospital - mostly English, with one aborigine and one American nicknamed ""Yank""  (Ronald Reagan, later president) - are asked to comfort him.  The results are insightful, poignant, and sometimes quite humorous, as Lachy doesn't want to make friends, but still not knowing his own prognosis, falls in love with the nurse (Patricia Neal, of The Day The Earth Stood Still, In Harm's Way etc.).

The Hasy Heart is one of the best movies Ronald Reagan had a big role in, perhaps the best next to Kings Row, though he had bigger roles in less famous movies like Hong Kong, in which he had the lead as an Indiana Jones type.  His performance here appears competent, at the very least, but considering the effective support he gives Todd to play off of, I'd give him much more credit than that.  In addition to the quality of the movie as a whole, in my opinion it has Reagan's 2nd or 3rd best performance..",1150243200,,1177,4.4766355140186915
643358,4,6303430953,"Richard Todd stars as a proud, stubborn Scottish soldier who learns some lessons about friendship in this little known film from 1949.  At the close of World War Two, and following surgery for the removal of a kidney, he recovers in a jungle hospital, with the truth about his very serious condition being kept from him.  His anger over his lack of a discharge, coupled with his hard attitude and demeanor, keeps him separated from fellow patients and nurse Patricia Neal.  Attempts are made to befriend him, but it only leads to conflict.  Ronald Reagan is the American patient ""Yank"" and he gives one of his better performances.  Neal is also good, although a little detached, as the nurse trying to keep the peace.  But it's Todd who really stands out, giving a moving performance as the friend-less Scotsman who has never fit in and has been hardened by the experience.  The scenes are played with honesty, and although the film reveals its stage origins, it doesn't seem static.  Director Vincent Sherman lets the characters and conflict drive this story about man's need for friendship, and the results are memorable.",1031443200,32,1123,4.873684210526315
643359,5,6303430953,"The dialogue is dated in places; some of the characters and scenes are not politically correct (this is an old film, of course); the special effects (at the beginning) are quite lame. Even so, I really REALLY loved this movie. In fact, I count it among the 10 all-time best movies I've ever seen. This story is about the transforming power of true friendship in the life of someone who is both utterly obnoxious and yet somehow endearing at the same time. Patricia Neal and Ronald Reagan are terrific in this film, but Richard Todd, as Lachie, steals the show with a moving performance that will stay with you, I think, for a long, long time.",1024358400,13,642,4.543103448275862

643552,4,6303430953,"Genuinely affecting thanks to the well-written script and excellent performances, especially Richard Todd. Todd ha s a difficult part--a misanthropic 24 year old Scot who changes along with the other men in a way that avoids schmaltz. Originally a play, but since it takes place at a military base hospital, it hardly matters, and director Vincent Sherman keeps it believably minimalist in set changes with naturalistic and believable acting. (Really filmed at L Studios in London).

In 1949, Ronald Reagan was 38 years old and his acting is quite good here as the leader of the group. His biggest scene actually brought me to tears and showed that, with a good part & good director, he had matured into a good, very competent actor.  Jack Warner liked the chemistry between him and Patricia Neal so much that he tried to find another property for them, but it didn't happen.

643636,4,6303430953,"This is a pretty good film.  Ronald Reagan gives lie to those people who snicker about his acting career.  He was quite competent.  The film really belongs to Richard Todd as the misanthropic soldier who doesn't realize he's dying until the end.  Todd was a fine actor and sadly not remembered much today except through his portrayal of Senate Chaplain Peter Marshall in ""A Man Called Peter"" in 1955.  The majority of his work was done in England.  He had a memorable cameo in ""The Longest Day"" playing the commander he served under as a paratrooper on D-Day.

Today everyone knows Pat Neal and The Gipper , but in America, little is remembered about the talented British leading man Todd. This performance, having earned him an Oscar nomination, simply drives the plot. The story has comedy but also literally brought me to tears due to the compelling ending! And no I don't cry at weddings or often when I watch movies. This is an engaging ,well edited story that seems like 30 minutes of pure entertainment!

643700,5,6303430953,"I first saw this when I just entered my teens and I found this a very moving film then and it stands up today in the same way. Richard Todd gave a great performance of a dour Scot who would not make a friend or become emotionally involved.  He is unaware of how serious his injury during an attack is and even though it is the end of the war and others are being returned to their homelands he has to stay in the field hospital.  Patricia Neal gives her usual first rate performance as the military hospital sister.  Ronald Reagan is a surprise as the American who tries to befriend Lachie (Richard Todd).  All the players turn in first rate performances.  If I were to write too much more I would spoil the film for viewers who had not already seen it but if you chose to buy this movie I feel you would not be disappointed as apart from the fact of it being black and white, it does not seem dated today.

643706,5,6303430953,"The story opens in an Allied Forces hospital in Burma, 1945, on the last day of the war.  Those patients who can travel are going home, but five remain (including one played by Ronald Reagan).  The head nurse (Patricia Neal) tells the men that a Scottish soldier (Richard Todd) is going to be joining them and asks for their help.  He has only a few weeks to live and is too ill to travel; since he has no family, she asks the men to befriend the solider in his last days  - but not to tell him he's dying.

This is a touching drama with many moments of humor.  The soldiers are all believable and their camaraderie is heartening.  Star Richard Todd does a great job with the Scottish accent.  He plays a tough, bitter man who never knew how to make friends and when he finally does shed his defenses, he ""shares a moment with kings.""  The lovely Patricia Neal is perfect as the compassionate nurse who helps the soldier find peace and Ronald Reagan is quite likable as the wise and easy-going ""Yank.""

The story really made me think about what I would want were I in this soldier's predicament.  To know or not to know?  To try and go half-way around the globe to die in an empty house or stay among new friends?  It's a wrenching dilemma whatever the decision, and the film doesn't sugar-coat it.  Top-notch acting and thoughtful script.  Recommended.",1285804800,3,1353,4.443089430894309
643757,5,6303430953,"""The Hasty Heart"" (1949) tells the story of a dying Scottish soldier, Lachie (Richard Todd), in Burma at the end of WWII.  Lachie is unaware of his condition and demands to be sent home to Scotland.  He's also a bit of a tough loner, and his physician decides to enlist the help of Sister Parker (Patricia Neal) to help Lachie die with some dignity.  Sister Parker and her patients (including a youngish Ronald Reagan) try to befriend Lachie to make his final weeks more comfortable.  The young Scot, though, refuses to cooperate.

Based on the play by John Patrick, ""The Hasty Heart"" provides some shrewd insight into the nature of friendship and the way in which people question each others' motives.  Although elements of the storyline are a bit dated, the film is tremendously moving at times.  Richard Todd, in his film debut, is spectacular as the stubborn Scotsman.  Todd served in WWII, and is completely believable in this role.  He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to Broderick Crawford for ""All the King's Men.""  Todd also won the Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Male.  Reagan has one of his better roles here, in what is arguably one of his best films, along with ""King's Row.""  The film at times veers towards sappy melodrama, but skilled director, Vincent Sherman (""Mr. Skeffington,"" ""Old Acquaintance""), keeps things on the right track.  This somewhat forgotten film is truly a beauty and deserves to be better known.",1284854400,4,1468,4.847389558232932

643759,5,6303430953,"OK, let's get Ronald Reagan out of the way. He did a good job in this (wish I could say the same about his presidency!). But this movie belongs to Richard Todd who died on Dec. 3 at the age of 90. I fell in love with him as a kid with his ""Robin Hood"" for Walt Disney. My favorite of his roles is probably ""A Man Called Peter,"" but when I read his obituary, I realized I had not seen A HASTY HEART -- and it was moreo than worth every minute. Beautiful story, beautifully filmed, and a fine cast. He also, by the way, appeared in a very good British film noir called NEVER LET GO -- also worth seeing.",1260403200,3,601,3.9344262295081966

643761,5,6303430953,"This film and its true star are all but forgotten today.  Nominally, Ronald Reagan heads the cast but it is Richard Todd who steals the film.  His performance is mesmerizing, a real tour de force.  I first saw it in 1949 at the age of 13 and several more times over the 60 years since it appeared.  Todd was nominated for an Academy Award in the best actor category but lost to Broderick Crawford who won for All the Kings Men.

The story concerns a Scot, wounded on the last day of WWII, who is going to die.  He doesn't know his fate or that the commanding officer of the medical unit treating him has asked his ward mates to try to make his last days of life pleasant.  This proves difficult since the Scot is very difficult to know or to like.

Their perseverence is rewarded by the dying man's response to their efforts.  We are rewarded by the exquisite beauty of his comments upon the discovery of friends, affection, and love.  When he learns of the commanding officer's request to his fellow patients he feels completely betrayed.  The scenes following this moment are almost unbearable emotionally with Todd literally reducing even the strongest among us to quivering wrecks.  Keeping the tissue handy is a must.

When I saw the film at 13 in 1949 the entire audience was in tears.  I've never watched the film among friends - male and female - who didn't break down more than once.  Is that an honest recommendation for seeing a film?  I think it is - one's emotion is a reaffirmation of one's humanity and a longing to know and keep genuine love and concern among humankind.",1243123200,6,1586,4.493006993006993

THE  WONDER OF IT ALL IS THAT IN THE END HE REALISES PEOPLE CAN GIVE FRIENDSHIP REGARDLESS OF HOW A PERSON IS TO THEM AND THE FILM ENDS ON A JOYOUS NOTE AS EVERYONE MOST OF ALL TODD ACCEPTS THE REALITY OF FATE, BUT DO SO IN HAPPINESS AND FRIENDSHIP.",1197763200,4,548,4.362745098039215

It takes place after the war at a military hospital. All
the soldiers in the hospital will be going home but one.
He ( Richard Todd) is dying and doesn't know it. Neither
do any of the other guys. Todd plays the very stoic and
unfriendly Scot to a tee. The nurse ( Pat Neal)knows that
the Scot won't be leaving the hospital and tries to get
to know and understand his standoffishness. He really is
an insufferably difficult person to warm up to. Ronald
Regan plays the head of the group and tries to be nice
to the Scot,but finds it all but impossible as do all
of the rest of the guys. The audience and the guys slowly get to know what has made the Scot the hard case that
he is and eventually everyone begins to get a little
closer to him. The way his life story unfolds is done
tenderly and with care. Eventually your heart goes out
to him. Todd is simply brillant in his portrayal.
Pat Neal is so incredibly believable as the nurse
that you find yourself hoping that if you ever have
to go to hospital,you hope she'll be there.
This is a tear jerker but it's still a feel good movie.

643764,4,6303430953,"I agree with the sentiments of reviewer David Baldwin (and really don't know what ""movie buff"" from L.A. is talking about) that ""The Hasty Heart"" is a great little film in which Ronald Reagan comes off quite nicely.  Somehow, even though Reagan went on to become one of the most noteworthy presidents in American history, this movie (one of his very best) has remained a genuine sleeper that nobody knows about!  I find this quite amazing.  Even if Reagan was not in it, the film deserves to be rediscovered on its own merit.  It's darling!  Richard Todd is very good in the lead, and Patricia Neal is always quality.

643766,5,6303430953,"Those who would dismiss Ronald Reagan's acting ability, whether for asthetic or politically partisan reasons, would be advised to check out ""The Hasty Heart"".  Reagan is essentially the de-facto leader of a group of ailing G.I.s of differing nationalities sidelined in a British run hospital in Burma during the waning days of World War II.  When the occasion called for it or the material warranted it Reagan rose to the challenge which is the case here.  Essentially, though, this film is more of a vehicle for Richard Todd who plays a headstrong Scotsman who has days to live.  Todd's character goes through the most changes in the film and he is superb.  At first his charcter is disagreeable but through a believable transformation we grow to like him.  Also good is Patricia Neal as a sympathetic Canadian nurse.  The film is sentimental without being mawkish.  It earns it's tears.  ""The Hasty Heart"" is part of ""The Ronald Reagan Signature Collection"" and is not being sold separately.
