4453317,5,B004QPOVE6,House burned a couple years ago. The only good thing was building a superior home entertainment system. Dolby 7.1 in ceiling speakers and over 300 watts to each. Even at maxed volume of 100 not a but of distortion. It does rock. Camera changes and such were well edited. Probably the best music rock video ever made.

4453331,5,B004QPOVE6,"The best concert movie I've ever seen - it even made a fan of my wife who wouldn't come to the Perth show from this tour as she wasn't ""into"" AC/DC, and she now regrets it mighty!
The sound mix is clean and rich, and the hi-definition footage crystal clear and brilliantly shot.
Watching this Blu-ray is as close to being there as possible, and it is astounding how many hits this band have had that will have you nodding along with their music before you know it. A fitting farewell to Malcolm (who did look like an ill man), and a must for anyone with a passing interest in this band. They may have been around for decades, but there is an energy in their stage show that current pop 'sensations' can only dream of, and the near hysteria of the Argentinian crowd plays brilliantly off the sheer power of the band. Phew!",1426464000,3,821,4.337662337662338

I loved the crowd shots that show all 75,000 frenetic Argentinian fans bouncing in unison. AC/DC pumps out hit after hit after hit sounding just like they did at their peak.  Brian's voice is strong and powerful, Angus' guitar is crisp and clear.  This is one of the greatest rock and roll bands sounding as good as they ever did.  This Blu-Ray is an essential piece of any rock fan's collection.",1421452800,,499,4.689655172413793

4453375,5,B004QPOVE6,"Some reviews talked about the bad edition. I don'n  think it was bad, just could be sometimes more focus on the musicians playing. But the capture of parts of the frenetic jumpimg audience put these show on the skies. Just want say about one thing : the sound of the snare drum ...Perfect !!! Compares it with the snare drum of Jason Bohan in Led Zeppelin show.",1388361600,,361,4.388059701492537
4453376,5,B004QPOVE6,I have all of the ACDC dvd's. this ranks right up there with the best. Of course its the latest one so it has songs off their latest cd along with their other monster  hits. A new stage and a crowd that's really into the show. My only complain with the filming is that they showed the crowd to much which took away from showing the band. Some crowd shots are nice but  come on they are there and people buy this dvd to see the band not the crowd.,1387238400,,446,3.9444444444444446
4453377,4,B004QPOVE6,"This is a great show, and worth having, especially if you're a harcore fan from way back in the day. The band plays well, walks it like they have always talked it. Only thing that bothers me is, how the fans at this show sing the riffs of the songs. That gets a little annoying, but doesn't totally take away from the thing. Just get it, have a drink, turn it up, and just sit back and get blown away.",1386201600,,401,4.025

4453379,5,B004QPOVE6,"If you are a fan of AC/DC this is a must buy! Sound is fantastic, picture looks great, and despite a few of the negative comments regarding camera work, I felt how large a venue this was and what a large stage/catwalk they had. Stadium rock is alive and well, my friends, and its name is AC/DC!!",1379462400,,295,4.192982456140351

Con:

Fiddle with the options, until you get the sound/speaker to work best for your system. I thought for a Blu Ray disc that the top options would be default.

4453402,4,B004QPOVE6,"I have watched this blu ray recently and it's an incredible performance by one of rocks best! However, I couldn't agree more with some of the reviews about the camera edits and moving overhead shots swooping around the audience. That's what I really want to watch when I go to AC/DC concert, Not Angus,Malcolm,not Brian, or Phil Rudd. insert sarcasm here.

When people buy a concert DVD, their expectations are ruined when these ""video jockey's"" impress themselves with their computer skills. Yawn.  As a viewer, I'm the most important part of the editing exercise, not the person pressing the buttons at the editing bay.  Not all viewers have the attention span of a gnat. So the editors with digital gear, make the cuts because they can, not with the viewer in mind.  ""Watch how fast I can cut this AC/DC concert into pieces!""  ""Aren't I a genius?""  Yeah, watch how fast I can stop watching. ""Look here comes Angus cranking a solo, cut to the audience, so the viewer can't see it!!!!"" They forget who's trying to watch on the other end.

Outside of the constant dizzying cuts, the sound is outstanding. Hard to tell if Brian over dubbed his vocals.
This is a very good AC/DC performance, just felt like this 4 star DVD was Shot Down in Flames by those who forgot that the stars were on the stage, not the editing bay.",1355356800,,1319,4.587234042553192
4453403,5,B004QPOVE6,"This is an amazing show for the most representative band of what rock actually is. AC/DC is pure power, and this concert pretty much sums it up. The video quality is top notch, as well as the audio; you won't be dissapointed by any technical issues here. Perhaps the one thing I didn't like much is the extras; besides the concert, there's not much more to be seen, only a (very) short documentary and a video for the intro of the concert.
In terms of the music itself, there's the usual classics, from back in black to highway to hell, let there be rock and all of the songs they always play live. There are 4 songs of the last album, Black Ice, which is a good thing by the way. Some of the songs, they play them at a lower tempo, but keeping them very powerful and true to the band's style.
Special mention has to go to the public. The audience itself gives this concert so much power its just amazing. It really adds to the experience to see 70.000 people jumping and singing like crazy all through the entire concert.
Overall, I'd say this is a must have for any AC-DC fan. If you're not a fan but are into rock, then you should try this out as well; it's a great way to get to like one of the greatest rock bands of all time.",1352937600,2,1231,4.154811715481172
4453424,5,B004QPOVE6,"A great concert to be sure, my complaint being too many audience shots(at least it's a very entertaining bunch of 65,000 or so) & slow down the editing please(a usual beef). At times you see more of the audience than you do of the band. That aside, AC/DC always rock and the crowd loves them, I wish crowds up here would be as crazy as the South Americans. A night well worth capturing on video & well worth watching & buying.",1352678400,,426,4.271604938271605

4453428,5,B004QPOVE6,"I've been an AC/DC fan for years, and this is by far their best concert blu-ray DVD ever done.

Angus, Brian, and the others are in great form, delivering a superb concert to the huge crowd with lots of energy and style... These guys are high-octane rock at it's very best.  Personally I like the active/dynamic camera work, the dp and video editing is great for capturing the energy of the crowd as well as the performance by the entire band.

AC/DC sounds better than ever in this one, and the video capture is crystal clear and looks great on blu-ray.  The crowd's energy adds a lot, and their enthusiasm about being part of rock history is great to watch, as is the band.  This one's a winner, one of my favorite new concert DVDs ever - highly recommended.  These guys show how it's done, they're the 'real thing' and capture the spirit and style of genuine rock & roll.

Their new songs they perform fit in great with classics like Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill, TNT, and Back in Black -- it's all good.  It's great to see a world-class show... thanks guys for rocking it hard, and to the fans.

There isn't one bad song on the entire disc, and the picture and sound quality are great.  I saw AC/DC live on this tour, and I can't decide which was better--this dvd or the concert in person..

4453432,4,B004QPOVE6,"I have Live at Donington on DVD, and had been considering upgrading it to Blu-Ray because it's just THAT good.  Then, BOOM, the lads release this gem from their latest tour with an insane crowd in Argentina.  So, I figured this would be my chance to ""upgrade"" AND get an updated concert.  As several have pointed out, the set list of the ""hits"" is almost identical to Donington.  The difference is that the older ""fill-in"" songs are largely replaced by new songs from Black Ice.  Personally, I think Black Ice is a strong album, and since I have Donington, I appreciate the different songs.

Audio/visually, this Blu-Ray is a stunner.  It was shot with over 20 high-def cameras, and the 5.1 sound is spectacular.  The stage and that crazy crowd add to the visual and create great energy.  I suspect that those who attended this concert were probably buzzing for days afterward.  The bigger your TV, and the better your sound system, the more you will enjoy this concert.  It MUST be played loud (duh).

OK, so great review.  Why ""only"" 4 stars??  Well, I'm being a bit picky, but these guys are showing a few signs of their age.  If this were the only AC DC concert video you ever saw, you'd think these guys were nuts the way they move around on the huge, elaborate stage.  But, when you watch Donington (or earlier) concerts, you see just how crazy they used to be.  Fact of life, they're just slowing down a tad.  It has no impact on the music or my enjoyment watching the show, but long-time fans will notice.

Regardless of that little nit, I highly recommend this disc!",1309478400,6,1575,4.5212765957446805

But I thought I was purchasing an ACDC concert. I would have given it a 5 star if they would have focused more on the band and less on the crowd.
The other reason I didn't give a 5 star. They never spent enough time on any one camera. Too much switching back and forth from camera to camera. It could have been so much better.",1308873600,4,480,3.8585858585858586

4453458,1,B004QPOVE6,"Hello everyone in Amazon land. This is a video of AC/DC playing live. Not a live video. The editing is extremely poor, with very little continuity. One second the bass player is by his amps, the next his mic. How did he get there so fast? One shot Angus is going up the ramp, the next he is by the singer on stage, lightning quick, I know!

4453462,5,B004QPOVE6,Just GREAT.  Shows the Black Ice Tour at its very best.  Crank up that volume and share it with the neighbors.  The HD picture is a bonus too.  AC/DC are the ultimate live band. At what other concerts would you see 72 year old women and 5 year old kids (and every age inbetween) having the time of their lives? That's how the Seattle show was.  If you like AC/DC - buy it! You won't be disappointed. AC/DC...We Salute You.,1307145600,3,422,4.225
4453463,5,B004QPOVE6,"This concert blows there previous live concerts out of the water!  For a band almost in there 30th year, there energy is flawless.  This is the best Brian Johnston has sounded, and the band always plays great!  The crowd in Argentina is just as much part of this concert!  They make you imagine yourself as the rock stars here, and it gives you goosebumps!  Great filming and sound...you will not be disappointed with this collection!!!",1306195200,4,436,4.76

4453465,4,B004QPOVE6,"I have been an AC/DC fan since I was 8 years old.  That is a lot of years now.  (I'm 43)
I collect nearly everything I can concerning AC/DC.  Yes, all album cover variants, etc.  My wife loves me.

This video is very good.  The crowd in Argentina is really what made it good.
The set list is pretty standard live stuff.
Shot down in flames, and dog eat dog are a nice change of pace, and harken back to the earlier Bon material.  Well Dog Eat Dog is earlier Bon material.  Shot down in flames is from Highway to Hell, which was Bon's last album with the band.

The band does a good job of chugging through the set list, and the crowd eats it up.
Interestingly, over the past few tours, Brian seems to be taking over a bit of the spotlight from Angus.  This is understandable, considering their age, and the effort it takes to pull off the antics Angus does every night.  Frankly, I like the balance, as Brian is a loveable ham, and does a solid job of engaging the crowd while not overdoing it.
Angus has really toned down the head bobbing and racing all over the stage.  Still breaks out the Chuck Berry duck walk now and then, but his act is half of what is was when he was a younger man.  Still kills it on the guitar!

I still feel that Live at Donington is their best live video in the Brian era.  Granted, they were much younger, and the show had a bit more energy; which I guess is what struck me about this video.  The lads are getting old, and it shows a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I couldn't do what they do night after night on these gigantic tours they pull off.  I guess it was a harsh dose of reality that myself and the band are getting old.

While I agree to a point with some of the reviews regarding the camera angles, I didn't find it too distracting.  Especially when they would get a shot of some of the lovely ladies of Argentina in the crowd.

I enjoyed the DVD, and will forever love this band.
Fans casual or otherwise will want to add this to their collection.",1305763200,7,1985,4.130548302872063

The sound is RIGHT THERE...by far better than any of their other dvd/bluray releases....In ""Ballbreaker"" and ""Stiff Upper Lip"", the guitars sound somewhat ""distant."" Anyone who owns those will know what I mean...but not this show...I'm still somewhat partial to Live At Donnington but I definitely got more with this disc than I was expecting....HD makes all the difference in the world....I had to laugh when Brian Johnson said, ""We don't speak Spanish very well but we play ROCK AND ROLL pretty good!"".....FIVE STARS for sure..I wish I could give it more....put it on Dolby Digital Multi-channel and crank it up...it will take your breath!",1305504000,4,873,4.986301369863014
4453469,5,B004QPOVE6,"It would be 5 stars if Bon Scott was in it.  I guess I will have to wait for that one next month :)  The picture and sound were great.  After reading earlier reviews I was worried about the camera work but honestly, all the jumping around didn't bother me.  Great setlist but I can see how people may complain if they have other recent concerts on disk.",1305504000,,353,4.147058823529412
4453470,5,B004QPOVE6,"First a quick word:  After reading the other reviews about the camera madness, I was really reluctant to purchase this.  I had it in my cart, deleted it, ordered it, tried to cancel, but didn't get to it in time.  Bottom line, I am really glad that I bought it.  The camera's in my opinion are not crazy.  There are alot of point of view changes, double screens, sometimes triple split screens, but camera madness?  I didn't feel that way at all.  Once I got used to the POV changes, the concert flowed and I liked the tempo of the changes and face it, these guys move around, especially Angus.  It's ACDC!
Now why I rated five stars.  The picture is amazing playing through a ps3 on a new HDTV, I was truly happy with the picture quality, so amazingly bright and clear, and the sound, is also incredible, so clear in fact you can hear every nuance of Angus playing, even the occasional flubs (it happens to everyone once in a while!).  All in all, this band is still great live, such high energy, such great songs.  I thought the song choice was right on, this was in support of Black Ice, so why would they not play songs from it???  When you have a band with such a prolific career you are not going to satisfy everyone when a setlist is concerned.  Also there were a few cute moments, the ""strip tease"" of Angus and the devil horns.  As stated by other reviewers these fans are high energy and SO excited.  Their jubilance was a great part of this show, they deserve a star all on their own!!!  Where can I get a pair of those devil horns??
I nearly forgot to talk about the extra features, forgive me!  The backstage features are :  The Fan, The Roadie and the Guitar Tech and the Meat.  And another featuring the animation they used on the big screens.  I enjoy the sections on the fans, there are some pretty wild fans in Argentina!  So many slept out there overnight in storms and rain to get the best seats they could.  Music really does unite people all over the world  I also  love the backstage looks.  They  had a soccer game the night before the concert and had to work two overnight crewss to get the stadium ready for ACDC, this was a huge show and required alot of work.  I love seeing the stage builds, preparation, the guys coming out and getting a look at everything as it goes up.  You see all those shots here and hear from the roadies and the guitar techs.  You get shots of the setlist, guitar setups, interviews with many different people associated with putting on the show, including the film producer who talks about selecting Argentina and the challenges of setting up filming.  You get to see them filming.  Some very cool extras I must say.  I also loved the animation (pink floyd and ozzy use animation on big screens too and I dig it)
All in all the product deserves five stars, afterall, when it comes to blu-ray it's all about is it worth the money for the picture and sound, I haven't viewed the DVD but I would say YES.
One thought, they  had a very cool long cat walk with an extra stage in the center, this was used only once by Angus, during an extended guitar solo/jam.  Brian occasionally went about half way along the catwalk, but I wondered why they didn't utilize it more.  Just a random ??

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.  What a great band, I wish I had been there.  Both ACDC and Argentina know how to rock.",1305244800,23,3372,4.302066772655008
4453471,3,B004QPOVE6,"ACDC is my favorite band so I had to go get this Blu-Ray today.
The Concert venue is Awesome and the emense crowd is all Jacked Up to say the least for this show.
Visually as well as the sound are very good for an outdoor show so big.

The use of multple cameras is nice to have,but if you have seen U2 360 then you know where I'm going with this. Every 3 or 4 seconds your wisked away to another shot of a band member,the group,the audience as a whole or section,or a tatoo on someone's arm of ACDC...etc (To the Editors of the disk.)Can you please stop long enough to take in the perspective of feeling your at the show as a person instead of a 100 cameras blinking. Way to many audience shots mixed into the show every few seconds.
Whoever edits these concerts and press's the button to cut to camera 2, back to camera 30, now to camera 16 thru the numders of cameras every 10 seconds or so,split screens,3 split screens. Come on,the guys that do this need to relax and lay off the coffee.""It IS way Overdone!
Worse of all someone,the Band has to aprove this,seriously?

Anywho if you can overcome the camera symphony its a great show could of done some different songs this tour with the older stuff. Song set selection is similiar to No Bull and Donnington with 4 new songs off Black Ice mixed in.

Let There Be Rock ""the Movie"" I seen in Theatres long ago will make up for it with less camera vollying and the pre Johnson set list.

If you don't aprove of this kind of camera work in your concert DVDs let them know here,somewhere please.
Its borderline unprofessional!

4453472,4,B004QPOVE6,"the long anticipated DVD from AC/DC's ""black ice"" tour is finally here.....and yes, it (mostly) delivers.

visually, blu-ray owners will more than likely be impressed, especially when comparing it head-to-head with the ""plaza de toros"" or ""donnington"" blu-ray titles. owners of big-screen HDTVs will be just as impressed with the picture quality as the folks with typical screen sizes.

performance-wise, the boys still play with more urgency than bands half-their age. having said that, occasionally the tempos might feel a tad slightly restrained on some of the quicker numbers (like ""whole lotta rosie"")....but then again, it'd be asking alot for them to play like it's 1977 again.

crowd-wise, let's just say the band sure knows how to pick host cities for their official releases, that's for sure. i promise you, no one's gonna mistake this for a miley cyrus crowd.....

setlist-wise, casual fans oughta eat it up. it's one classic track after another, and it's certainly a testimony as to how much well-known material the band has in their arsenal. on the other hand, some diehards might grumble about the choice of songs. take out the four new songs from ""black ice"" (for some reason, ""anything goes"" isn't included....don't know if it wasn't played, or played but not included), and you pretty much have the same songs you'll find on their other live releases. the most ""obscure"" track is arguably ""dog eat dog"", but even that song appears on the ""plaza"" release. of course it's understandable to include ""go to"" tracks like ""you shook me all night long"", ""for those about to rock"", ""highway to hell"", etc.....but some of the other songs should've been swapped out for lesser-known numbers, even if it was just for this one show (ala the ""stiff upper lip"" DVD).

but the truth is, once you fire this up in your DVD player, the negatives will probably wash away & you'll be basking in the positives. pick this DVD up ASAP, then count down the days 'til the ""let there be rock"" DVD release....it's a good month to be an AC/DC fan.",1304726400,15,2036,4.872832369942197
