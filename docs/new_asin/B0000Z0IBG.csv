1960623,3,B0000Z0IBG,"This is that comparative rarity from the Britisgh cinema in the 50's -a strongarm drama .Its plot is downright melodrama and centres on the rivalries of a gang of truckers operating between a number of gravel pits and a hugh construction site .

Stanley Baker -one of the few UK actors of the era  who could convince as a tough guy -plays an ex-con hired on as a driver and who falls foul of boss Patrick McGoohan when he discovers that McGoohan and another boss (William Hartnell)are running a scam by claiming there are 5 more hired drivers than is actually the case ,and pocketing the extra cash .They maintain the scam by working the other drivers illegally hard ,thus keeping the delivery schedule up to date ,despite the severe risk to men and machines this entails .

The driving sequences are good ,as are the performances especially from the ever excellent Herbert Lom as the likeable Italian driver Gino ,and McGoohan .

Look out also for a young Sean Connery in a movie made 5 years before Dr No and already showing definite screen presence .

The movie is restarined by today's standards  but even so the love scenes between Baker and the heroine ,capably played by Peggy Cummins

This is not great movie making but it is an worthwhile little movie that acts a sprecursor to the working  class themed movies like Saturday Night and Sunday Morning that came down the pike a short time later",1144800000,8,1401,4.620967741935484

1960635,3,B0000Z0IBG,"Hell Drivers is a nice British action drama that features a many 60's stars in their early days: Stanley Baker, Sean Connery , Patrick McGoohan, David McCallum, Herbert Lom and Gordon Jackson.  They tear up country back roads delivering gravel for concrete mixing and they compete against each other for bonuses and top pay.  Well directed by Cy Endfield, and it's amazing to see McGoohan in a rare villainous role, and Lom in a sensitive one.  Of course, you wonder thru the whole film, where are the police, but the relentless pace just makes you forgive some of the obvious incredibility.",1419724800,,591,4.8316831683168315
1960636,5,B0000Z0IBG,"I first caught this movie on the late late late show when I was 18. Loved it then and still do 30 years later. And I am a WOMEN!! Its like the ""real"" fast and furious (wich by the way I've never watched or had the desire to see)  It's just an awesome good action movie.",1399420800,,269,3.8035714285714284
1960637,5,B0000Z0IBG,"Were I to rate the film on its own qualities, it's a solid 5 stars. It's a classic, bringing back that 50's nostalgia of everyone loving trucks and Ex-con lingo. Now we need the Sean Connery/Patrick McGoohan/Herbert Lom/Jill Ireland DVD box set. But this DVD transfer has so many issues, it really brings the experience to a lesser degree. The top and bottom of the screen are cut off. Everything is flattened out so it's very lean and extended upward. Parts of the film are cloudy to the point of being unwatchable. If you can ignore the technical issues ([Region 2 Format: PAL]), the movie itself is highly recommended.

If you are into the 50's style The Wages of Fear Le Salaire De La Peur (1953) type movies, you will love this film. It is based on the tough, good trucker fighting the ruthless bad guys and the British working class loving it all. This was the day when they made a REAL tough guys film. There were no CGI graphics or millions of dollars to spend. This is just good old fashion acting, and road scenes they shot at normal speed or sped up. Watch the film, learn some British trucker history.

I loved Hell Drivers so much I tracked down a copy of the original VHS and purchased it from a local rental store because they don't make it on German DVD.",1384300800,,1270,4.423076923076923
1960638,5,B0000Z0IBG,"The 1957 British film ""Hell Drivers"" is not well known in the United States, but it has been featured recently in several 2013 film noir festivals, including ""Noir City DC"" held at the American Film Institute. The beautiful British noir actress, Peggy Cummins (b. 1925) was honored at the 2013 San Francisco noir festival where ""Hell Drivers"" was presented together with several more of her films. The American-born Cy Enfield (1914 -- 1995) directed the film.  Enfield had been blacklisted and spent the latter part of his life in Britain, unable to return to the United States.

""Hell Drivers"" is a gritty tough noir film that features several stars including Cummins and a young Sean Connery in a supporting role. The movie tells the story of an ex-convict, Tom Yately (Stanley Baker) who seeks to make a new life for himself upon his release from prison.  He secures a job driving a truck at what appears immediately in the film as a questionable company, Hawlett Trucking, and its manager, Cartley, (William Hartell). Hawlett's business consists of hauling gravel in trucks from a pit down the road. The trucks are shaky and poorly maintained.  The company makes large, unreasonable demands on the drivers in terms on number of loads to be hauled per day. The drivers must speed, break traffic rules and drive recklessly to meet their quota.

The drivers are also pitted against one another in terms of the numbers of their runs.  The leading driver, a sinister figure named  Red, (Patrick McGoohan) doubles as the foreman. Red and Tom take an instant dislike to one another as Tom unwisely tries to compete with Red for making the largest number of hauls Tom makes friends with another driver, Gino, an Italian immigrant (Herbert Lorn). Tom and Gino become unwitting rivals for the attentions of the alluring and flirtatious company secretary, Lucy (Peggy Cummins).

Much of the movie consists of scenes of the gravel pit, Hawlett's service yard, and the narrow, twisting roads that the drivers must travel many times daily in their hauling. The tension builds as the carry their dangerous loads in ill-maintained trucks, and compete with one another. The movie also creates noir atmosphere in its settings in a cheap rooming house where the drivers stay, in the greasy caf&eacute; where they eat, and in a sleazy dance hall where the drivers try to find entertainment and women. The friendship between Tom and Gino and their affections for Lucy play a critical role. The movie builds to a sharp climax in a road battle between Tom on the one hand and Red and Cartley on the other hand. The acting, particularly by the two villains, captures the dark character of the story. The film is raw and disturbing in its build-up and tension and in its atmospheric portrayal of lower-class British life in the years following WW II.

I was fortunate to get to know ""Hell Drivers"" at the DC film noir festival. Devotees of film noir will love this unusual British movie.

1960640,4,B0000Z0IBG,"Set in a gritty small town in England, the story centers around an ex-con, played very well by Stanley Baker, who wants to go straight and takes a tough job as a truck driver incented to deliver as many loads as possible and at any cost. Brutal in parts, the film does capture two very different aspects - one, that fraud can take many shapes and forms; and two, how difficult it is to be an ex-con trying to go straight. On a whole different level, it was amusing to see several major stars in early roles, especially Sean Connery before he becomes James Bond.",1369008000,,561,4.352380952380952
1960641,5,B0000Z0IBG,"Until the above was screened @ San Francisco's Castro Theatre, I had no familiarity with it @ all.  There was a special tribute to British Film Star, Peggy Cummins & she was there, in person, to meet & greet her fans, newly converted & those already very aware of her contributions to the Film Noir Era.  It was very gracious of her to autograph my DVDs that I brought in just for that occasion.  This film presented a very nitty-gritty look @ Post World War II real British working class culture.  There was no Royalty flitting around from place to place.  These were ordinary people Hell-bent, you might say, on just earning enough money to keep the landlords satisfied.  If lucky, they had enough extra from their pay to buy food, much of which remained high priced & under ration for many years after the War was over.  It was not an easy film for most Americans to connect with, but I think the pacing of it, the focus on the plight of the poor, made it real, and gave us some history that took the focus from London & palaces, to the people who could not take a daily bath, who had, at most two sets of clothing, and were in a dog-eat-dog world before the term became linguistic parlance.  What we got on our side of the Atlantic, in terms of British culture, was usually painted up to show nothing but the very rich & we lost track that the average person there was not having an easy time of it due to economic restrictions that granted very few opportunities for culture & wealth to trickle their way down.

They encourage their truckers to drive like heck to their destination, running innocents and fellow truckers alike off the roads and into ditches, quarries, cliffs and forest in an attempt to -- oh, why spoil it for you. This is a well acted  delight from the same guys who, in just a couple years, will give us the masterpiece ""ZULU"". The story and direction is fresh, the locations in rural Great Britain fascinating and talent, headed by Stanley Baker (Guns of Navarone, Zulu) and an unexpectedly threatening Patrick McGoohan (Secret Agent, Braveheart) are in top form in this under appreciated gem.
