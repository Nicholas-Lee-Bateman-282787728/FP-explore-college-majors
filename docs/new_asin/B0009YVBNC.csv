2343129,4,B0009YVBNC,I found the Baby Learns Alphabet and Phonics DVD to meet my expectations for entertainment value and educational content.,1239840000,2,121,5.421052631578948
2343130,1,B0009YVBNC,"Like many other parents I bought the whole DVD set hopeing that it would help my children. (3 and 20months) To my dismay these DVDs were very bad quality in deed.  The graphics didn't attract my 3 year old son at all, and he barely watched for 5 minutes before running away.  My 20 month old daughter watched for a little while but some of the odd graphics actually upset her to the point of tears.  The alphabet DVD is too long and not visually appealing enough to make children of these ages want to watch.  I strongly reccomend that if your child is near or over 2 years old, don't bother with these DVDs.",1238371200,4,608,4.260869565217392
2343131,5,B0009YVBNC,"My 14 months old baby loves it! We bought the numbers, the alphabet and the shapes DVD's. She likes them all and you can tell she is really learning.

The music and the graphics keep the attention of my daughter and encourage her to say the words she is listening on TV.

She can count 1 to 5. She learned this weekend to say yellow and blue watching these videos.

I highly recommend them.",1154908800,15,390,4.243243243243243
2343132,2,B0009YVBNC,One of the items I regret buying. Even my daughter didn't want to bother watching it after the first time. Poor quality DVD.,1151280000,2,124,4.434782608695652
2343133,4,B0009YVBNC,"We have a [...] who is very active. When we turned on the DVD, she took to the Alphabet and Phonics DVD well. It caught her attention and she's been asking to watch it many times. The educational aspect appeals to me. She enjoys the music.
I give it four stars. She seems to be making progress with the letters. I like the recap feature in the DVD.",1148515200,9,348,4.132352941176471
2343134,5,B0009YVBNC,"My son liked the Alphabet and Phonics DVD. Once we received it in the mail, he watched it several times.

The reason I liked it because it was quite educational. The music was peppy and so were the animations. The aim of the DVD which is to educate and entertain, I think is pretty much met well.

My husband and I enjoy watching our son point at all the images in the DVD. He then shows them to us at home. He also enjoyed the live shots of the animals.

 The good thing about the DVD is that it is pretty long, about 45 minutes. This engages my son for a long time.

There are about a 100 images in the DVD, which is lot like showing an alphabet book to a child. The DVD is also priced reasonably.

The kind of mom I am, I lay stress on learning. There are a lot of videos out there in stores, that have songs and all kinds of plots, but lack the main ingredient, which is why I prefer this one. The main focus for the Alphabet and Phonics DVD is learning.

My son tells me to put the Alphabet DVD on very often. It is one of his favorite DVDs. He also likes the Baby Einstein DVDs, which he watches often.

According to him, he likes the X part since that is his favorite letter. He enjoys the recap after every 5 letters, which is a good idea, since it reinforces the learning process. Each letter is shown big and wide.

This DVD has definitely helped my son learn his letters. My husband, my son and I are happy with our purchase.",1147392000,15,1436,4.0638297872340425
2343135,5,B0009YVBNC,"This set of learning DVD's are some of the best I have seen. My one year old simply loves them! As parents we get to watch them over and over... as I watch them with my son, I see how he looks at me and learns from the content and then try's to share with us both his enthusiasm and what he is learning. Out in the world he is identifying things that he has learned and is a lot more interactive in trying to convey his thoughts. Great product!",1142726400,9,444,3.9444444444444446
2343136,5,B0009YVBNC,"Karen and Penny (US Virgin Islands)

This DVD is a great instructional and educational tool. The letters of the alphabet are associated with many objects which help the younger kids to identify the letters. The older kids learn the sounds of the letters. This sets the stage for blending the sounds, phonics. They also learn the words and spelling of the words. My granddaughter dances to the music as she repeats the words, letters and sounds. She gets very excited when she sees the live animals.",1131235200,9,498,4.790697674418604
2343137,5,B0009YVBNC,"I bought this DVD from Galloping Minds directly. My son loved it. This is the new version of the Alphabet DVD from Galloping Minds. All the new ones are 'Baby Learns..'. This is a good buy, because a lot of objects are shown. My son repeats the words and enjoys the animations. He really loves the live animals!! A good educational DVD.",1128384000,4,336,4.435483870967742
8070577,4,B0009YVBNC,My toddler damaged the 1st one that we owned.  I purchased it again as she loves it but somehow this 2nd purchase  is a bit different from the 1st.  My gal prefer the 1st version,1411257600,,178,4.0285714285714285
8070578,5,B0009YVBNC,"This is one of his favorite DVDs and one of my best purchases. I got it for the phonics and was impressed that by the end of the first watching, not only was my son already asking for it to be played again, he really retained the information. I've bought  loads of other stuff from Amazon along these lines but this is one of the few packages that I was genuinely happy with. For such a reasonable price this is a great buy and I recommend it to all.",1391558400,2,450,4.056179775280899
8070579,1,B0009YVBNC,"I don't enjoy writing a negative review on any product. I'm usually one to ""not bother"" complaining. BUT, this item is not worth what I paid for it. It's doesn't help my daughter focus on the alphabet. She just watches the images and simply learns the names of whatever the picture is like ""apple"" or ""elephant"", which are things she already knows because she's almost 4 y.o. I was hoping this video would help her remember the names of the letters and how they sound. But it didn't. This video is better suited for children between 1 and 2 years old.",1391212800,,551,4.465346534653466
8070580,4,B0009YVBNC,Granddauther (age 2 1/2 likes this one.  She repeats what is said in the DVD which means she's following it closely.,1361145600,,116,4.523809523809524
8070581,5,B0009YVBNC,My four year loves this DVD. Its very educational for little ones. It is fairly simple and in my opinion effective for teaching the alphabet. The music is calming and the letters and words are also spoken in a calm manner. As a parent I was looking for something educational and this fits the bill. A reasonably priced DVD.,1356566400,,323,4.491525423728813
8070582,3,B0009YVBNC,"This is great to learn, however it is very Boring babies wil stop watching it after 2 minutes. I get bored watching it, but like I said I love the way they show you the letters and the item that match with it. Really best ones are Leap Frog Learning DVD, can't go wrong.",1320537600,,270,4.018518518518518
8070583,5,B0009YVBNC,"My thought is that this is a very clever way to teach my kids how to associate images, letters and words. I believe that this series is literally ingenious to teach your kids, in a very easy way, how to associate  images with words. What I really liked about the series is how it can be used for both, very young, as well as more grown up kids because of the way the learning material has been structured.",1316131200,2,405,4.1923076923076925
8070584,5,B0009YVBNC,"Baby Learns Alphabet and Phonics from Galloping Minds is a wonderful educational DVD for young children. It prepares babies and toddlers for reading and school. The suggested age that will benefit most from this DVD is age 1 - 4 years of age but you can never start too early familiarizing your baby with the alphabet.

Baby Learns Alphabet and Phonics introduces children to the alphabet in an easygoing and gentle way so that your child won't be overwhelmed or over stimulated. They start with the letter A and show a video or sometimes an animation of a few objects that begin with that letter. Every few letters they recap what your child has learned which reinforces the lesson. The animations and videos within the DVD are excellent. My son really enjoyed the clips of the live animals throughout the DVD.

What I, as a parent, liked the most about the way they taught the letters is that they not only said the letter but they also said how the letter sounds phonetically. This is essential for when a child is learning to read and there are so many educational toys and DVDs that don't teach the phonetics. Something else that this DVD does is it shows the printed letter in both capital and lowercase forms.

The DVD is 44 minutes long, I try to put it on around bedtime for my son since the classical music in the background is soothing and I've heard that children retain more right before they go to sleep. I have really seen progress in my son that is directly related to the Baby Learns Alphabet and Phonics DVD. I own a few of the Galloping Minds DVDs and I have been pleased with all of them. They have really benefited my son greatly and I would highly recommend them to any parent who has young children.",1273795200,4,1722,4.49520766773163
8070585,2,B0009YVBNC,"I bought 3 DVDs and 2 flash cards package hoping to make a super kid out of my 2-year-old.  To my surprise the Alphabet and Phonics DVD did not offer any creative teaching tool.  Little ones learn better when the information is packaged in the form of music,songs and some dance.  This DVD had no songs or action, just some elevator type background music.

It fell short of any PBS kids programs. My son didn't pay attention after 10 minutes.

The flash card is very attractive but a 2-year-old might find some unfamiliar animal names and words.  I found similar flash cards at Walgreens for much cheaper price.

I didn't want to open the rest of the DVDs or flashcard, I sent my purchase back and got a refund.",1273708800,,711,4.465116279069767
8070586,5,B0009YVBNC,"I find this DVD very educational and interesting. All my grandchildren have enjoyed watching this DVD and are fascinated by it. As a retired English teacher, I recommend the DVD since it covers uppercase, lowercase letters and phonics. Each video segment is accompanied by the spelling of each word which facilitates word-recognition. The kids enjoyed all the animals shown in the DVD.  At the end of a few letters, a recap of the letters helps the kids remember what they just watched. It definitely helps reinforcing their abcs and is great for preschool learning. I also noticed the dvd has a calming effect on the kids. The DVD is long - over 40 minutes - so well worth the money.",1250294400,4,684,4.7
