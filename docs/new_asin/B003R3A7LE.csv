8403106,5,B003R3A7LE,I am always looking for 30 minute workouts I can do in the mornings before I go to work and this one is very good.  I am very pleased with it.  It is a good mix of cardio and strength training and I feel like I got a good sweaty workout in a short amount of time.  I really recommend this.,1339027200,2,289,3.7049180327868854
8403107,4,B003R3A7LE,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Pros:  Instructor is rather serious and calm with a low voice --- all things I like best in an instructor.  I am picky about kickbox type workouts and --- while her natural movement seems a shade stiff and even a smidge awkward --- I found her form clean enough that I can go with it.  Speaking of kickboxing, that second workout with all the kicks made the workout since it got the sweat going and my heart rate in my target zone.  As with most workouts, whenever the moves slow down too much for my heart rate, I substitute higher intensity moves to keep it up e.g., instead of marching in place I run or jump.  Music was not my favorite but at least it was audible and had a beat to keep time to the moves and that is all you can ask.  Camera work was good, focusing on what you needed to see when you needed to see it and no dizzy or unnecessary zooms.  I am not a huge fan of a different move every five moves and the cuing was not the always the best to keep you in time with the changes.  That said, I was able to follow along without any major frustration and the changes did flow rather well and make the time go by fast so, all in all, a pro.

Cons:  The main menu left a lot to be desired.  It took forever to struggle and figure out which option was highlighted, you could barely see where the cursor/bright font is on the overly busy menu background.

Watching preview clips of this video, I was unsure if this instructor's style was going to work for me.  I was really surprised at the end to find that I had enjoyed this quite a lot and --- most importantly --- received a very decent workout in 30 minutes.  Looking forward to more from this instructor.",1311897600,2,1725,4.169184290030212
8403108,5,B003R3A7LE,"I am a nonmotivated work out person--I go in spurts and at best, am often just intermediate. I was worried that this DVD would be too difficult to do, but it wasn't. It was hard, but Tracie changes things up quickly so that you're not sitting there wondering when she will stop. It was very effective working muscles I don't usually annoy when doing workout routines. I also thought the weights while on the floor for abdominal work and chest/arms was very tough, but again doable. For 30 minutes, wow, what an awesome workout.",1294963200,2,527,4.617021276595745
