2198663,5,B0006ZXTRK,This is an awesome DVD! Well worth it at any price. Amazon had it for less than anybody. Artie at his drunken funniest!,1125187200,6,119,4.217391304347826
2198664,3,B0006ZXTRK,"Artie Lang certainly gives bang for the buck here. You get very good stand up, a short film of his, and behind the scenes footage. That's better than most DVDs.

This is typical Artie, he's usually pretty bombed, witty, and funny. During a skit where he expalins how he is the only white guy playing basket ball with blacks and uses a racial slur when asking one of the other players to throw him the ball, I had to rewind several times until I finished laughing. Very funny stuff.

The overall feel of the DVD is somewhat amatuerish. It is not a high quality production, but it doesn't skimp on humor. If you're looking for a slick DVD made by a huge film crew, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a few good laughs at an affordable price, pick this up.",1121644800,9,756,4.3546099290780145
2198665,3,B0006ZXTRK,"I like Artie on the Howard Stern Show, but his standup is basically yelling ""Fire!"" and making other references to his jokes on the Stern show when his normal routine doesn't get any major laughs. I was a little dissapointed, because I honestly think Artie is so much better when he's calmer, i.e., not drunk, and not pandering to a drunken crowd that equates humor with simply yelling profanities. I was not offended by the profanity, I just think swearing with no real joke attached is just lazy and pointless.",1118188800,11,512,4.7
2198666,3,B0006ZXTRK,"Artie is a likable chap. He runs circles around JACKIE THE BROKE MAN MARTLING,and was a perfect addition to the Howard Stern crew. But, if this is his best standup stuff; He's not much of a comic. He is a funny feller, but alot of his bits drag. Lange is pretty fearless, saying the N-word, talking trash about gays, and admitting(as well as exploring) his many demons(problem gambling, problem drinking, problem coke snorting, problem crapping one's pants on smack). Great comics do have big ugly Demons-Maybe this DVD caught him on a crap night. He seems to be stalling many times...his pacing is wobbly. The crowd hoot and hollor, because they're a bunch of those ""YEAAAH!!!!PARTY!!!!!LOOK AT ARTIE DRINK!!!!WHEEEW!!!!-type of turkeys. Maybe you should be drunk in order to fully appreciate this seemingly mediocre set. I like this DVD, but I think Artie has better stuff up his sleeve. Maybe im just a jerk. I dunno.",1117497600,5,920,4.903846153846154
2198667,5,B0006ZXTRK,"I have been a fan of Artie Lange's since he was on MadTV.  His appearences on the Conan O'Brien show were hysterical. So, when he took over the ""Jackie Chair"" on the Howard Stern Show I was thrilled.  Of course with his success on the show it was obvious to all the regular listeners that Artie was going market something eventually.  When word of the DVD first came out on the air I knew I would buy it, but I didn't hold out hopes that this would be a great stand-up act.  I was wrong.

Artie's stand up was not only funny enough to make you laugh until you cried, but it was extremely original.  The vast majortity of the act was funny, well-paced and at times even a little insightful.  When it failed it is not for lack of trying, but some of the material isn't worked out very well.  A classic bit is Artie's observations on Harry Carry.

Is it the best stand-up ever, no.  Is it great, yes.  Is it worth the money?  Absolutely!",1116979200,3,934,4.214689265536723
2198668,5,B0006ZXTRK,"it is people like artie that i have to thank to keep me in a comical and positive mood. Ever since dirty work came out when i was like 11 years old, ive idolized artie lange. artie speaks the truth on stage over many issues but finds a way to put it in a humorous way. Artie Lange is extremely underrated, which is pretty lame because he's fricken hilarious. Altogether, i was flattered very much by this DVD, even though it is vulgar, but its clever humor that will have you short of breath from laughing so hard. go out and buy it now, its real affordable and perfect for a comedy collection!",1113091200,2,594,4.265486725663717
2198669,4,B0006ZXTRK,"If John Belushi's character in Animal House had become a comedian, he would have been Artie Lange.

Artie Lange had been on both television (MAD TV) and in movies (most notably DIRTY WORK) before joining the Howard Stern show as Jackie the Jokeman's official replacement.  It was Stern's show that has given him the most exposure.

The concert on this DVD was shot in April 2004 in Tempe, AZ and contains many inside references that Stern fans will recognize (including imitations of Jeff the Drunk and Artie's trademark AC/DC scream ""FIRE!"").  The show is fair and balanced and will equally offend both extremes on the political left and right.  And while some of Artie's schtick here has already been on the Stern show, there are some great moments including his discussion of a street basketball game and his analysis of a classic Warner Bros. cartoon character.  What's amazing is how many people in Arizona are tuned into Artie's distinct brand of New Jersey humor, right down to detailed descriptions of New York sports teams.

The DVD also contains 2 special features:

a)  GAMEDAY, a short 17 minute film, made in 2000 and written by Artie.  Artie's ease in front of the camera is apparent and really the only reason to watch this short.  I think Artie included this on the DVD for sentimental reasons, it's the weak portion of the disc.

b)  BACKSTAGE PASS, a 24 minute documentary following Artie to two of his concerts in New Jersey.  The first show was in May 2004, the second show is June 2004 and was a benefit for the Rev. Bob Levy to raise money for his divorce expenses.  Watching Artie here is like watching a train wreck:  from shoveling down truckloads of processed meat to washing it down with his trademark Jack and water, the man is clearly in a lot of pain.  And yet, the film is strangely compelling as you see that, despite years of living in Los Angeles and having become a national celebrity to Stern fans, Artie is the same guy who used to work the piers in New Jersey.

If you enjoy Artie on the Howard Stern show, you will enjoy this DVD.  Maybe this will be more like the Artie we hear when Stern moves his show to ""eh, eh, eh.""",1108080000,39,2160,4.549222797927461
2198670,5,B0006ZXTRK,if you love to laugh then this one is for you!!!!  Artie gets wasted and tells it like it is!!!  Don't miss the bonus footage as it will keep you laughing till you crap your pants!!!  Artie Rules!!!!,1107907200,4,199,4.184210526315789
2198671,5,B0006ZXTRK,"I saw this - got it through a friend of the Stern show. Artie rules. This is the dvd you bring out the bong, shot glass and mushrooms and watch with your mom and dad. Its well worth the $11 - you'll watch it over and over. I don't understand how this guy isn't in a sitcom....",1106697600,8,276,3.8596491228070176
2198672,5,B0006ZXTRK,"Fans of the Stern show will love this DVD, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart or for those easily offended. It is a way to enjoy Artie's uncensored stand up act in the comfort of home. You get the feeling that Artie might say or do anything after downing several shots, so actually going to a show might be a risk. You might get a great set or you may just get to watch a drunk act stupid. However, you can't go wrong for the price of this DVD.",1106179200,8,456,3.967391304347826
2198683,5,B0006ZXTRK,I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words.  That  is what makes me not even give a review. It keeps saying there is a problem with my review! ARGH!,1358380800,,179,4.085714285714285
2198684,4,B0006ZXTRK,"I had the chance to get this for a very cheap price, it's one of Artie's shows in his prime, with some preliminary ""hanging out"" sequences and banter. Artie Lange was one of the funniest and most down-to-earth comedians around, and it shows well in this DVD. The only problem with any show by a great comedian, is that it's over too soon. If you're a fan of his, it's worth having in your collection.",1334102400,,400,4.346666666666667
2198685,1,B0006ZXTRK,"Ordered this a while back, when Artie was on Howard Stern. I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I am a big fan, but I would not recommend this. Beer League was enjoyable, this was painful.",1303257600,,196,4.324324324324325
2198686,5,B0006ZXTRK,"Even if your not an Artie Lange fan, if your a fan of True, Gritty comedy, then this is for you.  Artie Lange is a man with many problems.  A man many of us can relate to.  Yes.  He tried to kill himself in 2010 by Stabbing himself in the stomach 9 times.  He survived thank god and all his fans hope his career continues and he betters himself.

His comedy is along the lines of Kinison, Pryor, Leary and Carlin if they all got in a wicked bar fight, after a night of drunken' debauchery, and threw up all there jokes onto the floor and fell asleep in them.  Artie is pure brilliance and his command of a room is like no other.

Quite a few of our friends had never heard of Artie Lange and almost peed themselves laughing so hard at this dvd.  He's that funny.  Yes.  Buy It, Watch it but before you do, be sure to pee.",1293062400,,821,4.006172839506172
2198687,5,B0006ZXTRK,If you know and heard of Artie Lang. Then you will love this DVD. This DVD is so funny and laughed just about the whole time.,1265500800,,125,3.8461538461538463
2198688,5,B0006ZXTRK,Funny!  Well if you like Arties' style of humor.  It isn't for everyone and certainly not for kids.,1252713600,,99,4.444444444444445
2198689,1,B0006ZXTRK,I guess I enjoyed the clean version of Artie's life stories from the Stern terrestrial radio show. The foul language only detracted from his comedy.,1244592000,,148,4.96
2198690,5,B0006ZXTRK,I'm not sure why this DVD has gotten some bad reviews. It was everything I expected it to be which was HILARIOUS and OFFENSIVE. That is the main reason Artie has a fan following. I haven't checked out the special features yet but the stand up set alone was well worth the money.,1181088000,2,278,4.264150943396227
2198691,3,B0006ZXTRK,"If you don't know Artie Lange, don't buy this. If you do, think about buying it, but don't buy it blindly. I did. And it was a mistake.

I love Artie. He's a great addition to the Show. But, his standup has something to strive for. He is not John Belushi. He is not Chris Farley. He's a wannabe, but those two heroes made it to SNL. Artie was just on MadTV, the 2 season of MadTV that made me hate it; not funny at all. I guarantee if he tried out for SNL nowadays, he'd make it, but there would be tons of writers to make him funny. Nothing of the sort on imitation-wannabe-MadTV. He wouldn't qualify for anything Second City. And he didn't earn it. By himself, he's not funny at all. With other writers, hilarious.

This DVD is okay. But don't expect him to be funny unless you're a redneck 4-5 years behind on comedy. If you laugh at everything your little sister says, or anything that your uncle Charlie says, you'd love this DVD. But if you have more of an experienced tongue and can judge comedy on an NYC LA level, don't get this DVD. It's just not funny.",1172966400,2,1063,4.205882352941177
2198692,4,B0006ZXTRK,"Very funny, would have enjoyed more behind the scenes footage though",1171238400,,68,5.2727272727272725
2198703,3,B0006ZXTRK,I love Artie's stand up. I listen and watch Artie and others on the Howard Stern show on sirius. I really like Artie's stand up routine but I think they could have done a better job of producing a more interesting video. A lot of the video seems almost like a home movie with Artie talking about his life as a comedian. Overall its a pretty good dvd but I don't know how many times I will watch it in the future.,1170720000,,412,4.036585365853658
2198704,1,B0006ZXTRK,"What a waste of money. I fell asleep during the performance. He should not have wasted his time and money putting this together the routine is weak, and not very funny. If you listen to the Howard Stern Show then don't buy this you already have heard it all from the show. FIRE!!!, is his way to get the crowd to react when he is bombing on stage.",1170201600,,347,4.117647058823529
2198705,3,B0006ZXTRK,"He is much better to listen to on Howard Stern. I was not impressed by his standup, but I bet seeing him in real life would completely change my mind.",1170028800,2,150,4.033333333333333

2198707,4,B0006ZXTRK,"A no holds barred not politically correct comedy routine by Howard Stern's outrageously funny side kick Artie Lange
A DVD of a live performance at a comedy club where everyone parties with Artie with his laugh a minute stand up act. Artie is a brilliantly funny guy who remains true to his roots and leaves nothing or no one unscathed including himself for the sake of comedy.
A must for all fans of Artie Lange and the Howard Stern Show fans!",1168300800,,443,4.481481481481482

2198709,4,B0006ZXTRK,"I gotta admit, if I didn't know Artie from the Howard Stern show, I probably wouldn't like this as much as I do. But hearing Artie every day for the last five years, this pretty much exemplifies his greatest quality- being able to tell a funny story about his life.

He's not the best comedian around... not by a long shot... But he's a damn funny guy, and he is very open with himself- almost too open, like a flesh wound that you can't take your eyes off of sometimes.

I haven't watched the special features yet, but the standup video itself is easily worth the nine bucks that Amazon is asking for, especially if you already a fan of the guy.",1160524800,3,646,4.286885245901639

2198711,3,B0006ZXTRK,"I bought this DVD for my boyfriend who is a big Howard fan.  He seemed to enjoy the humor, but he wasn't laughing as much as he expected.  I wasn't too amused with it.  I have seen better.",1141948800,7,188,3.8947368421052633
2198712,2,B0006ZXTRK,"...when he has to carry his own show, it falls pretty flat. I love Artie on Howard, he makes so many funny comments and observations, but thats when he is only chiming in once in a while. On this DVD, he is in the spotlight, and has no one else (like Howard and the gang) to fall back on. I was expecting a HILARIOUS stand-up routine from Artie, on par with Chris Rock, and what I got was a DVD that didn't make me laugh out loud once. Sure, I smiled several times, was amused several times, but no real laughs. Ironically, after watching this DVD I watched Larry The Cable Guy's DVD (which I thought would be HORRIBLE) and laughed about 40 times. I expected a lot more from Artie. The DVD isn't BAD, its just not very funny. At all. And that's coming from a big fan of the Stern show. At under $10 though, it can't hurt to try it and see if you agree with me.",1133222400,10,860,4.064705882352941

Yes it's funny, but it's also distracting having it look like his buddy shot it on an iPhone.
