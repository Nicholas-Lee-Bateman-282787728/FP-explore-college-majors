2744923,3,B000MRNWKQ,"Ive never seen this movie, however I know about the original myth.

its a story about the first wife of Adam, a woman who embraced evil and darkness as a solution for revenge against Adam and his decendents.

All because adam didn't want her to be on top. lol

Ive seen and heard about alot of bad ideas, in my time but what she did takes the cake.

After a pathetic painful ""character establishment"" thing where these two losers try to make themselves look cool with some hepatitis ridden looking women the movie kicks in with terrible dialog and more losers.  You can tell which women were cast because they banged the producer (hope he has extra penicillin) which normally doesn't offend me - if it wasn't that the acting was soooooo bad.  Maybe they weren't acting, maybe they're just dumb losers on vacation, I don't know.  If your 15 and you want to know not how to get women, then watch this movie.",1409184000,,574,4.767676767676767

2745135,2,B000MRNWKQ,"Adam (R.L. Mann) is a rich kid and womanizer. He is hopelessly unlikable and is our protagonist. The film attempts to make his dad (David Keith) look bad for shutting him out, but Adam is the kid you would want to go play in traffic. On spring break Adam meets the ""hotter than hot"" Lilith (leave no cliche untouched) and they have wicked sex. Adam leaves, but Lilith (Natalie Denise Sperl) manages to find him anyway and soon the killings begin. Lorenzo Lamas  appears briefly as they reenact ""Top Gun."" Gary Busey makes his fitting cameo near the end, the highlight of the whole film.

The film was rather a bore. Our Succubus should have been the hottest woman in the film, but didn't look as good as the bikini eye candy background or support female cast. The top stars were on the screen for only a moment and the whole ""Top Gun"" scene which was written to support a few cute lines, made no sense outside of that.

The film appeared like it was supposed to be a campy comedy-horror film, but for some reason writer/director Kim Bass didn't know how to make a bad film by design, instead made one by accident.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. Brief Nudity (Natalie Denise Sperl)",1395878400,2,1179,4.52112676056338
2745136,3,B000MRNWKQ,Somewhat captiving with choice of actors. The actors do a really good job the plot was a little drier than what I was expecting.,1383350400,,128,4.375
2745167,5,B000MRNWKQ,It is a little twisted tale about a rich kid that meets Lilith on spring break and what happens afterwords.,1370736000,,107,4.4
2745168,2,B000MRNWKQ,"""I feel the need, the . . . need . . . for . . . speed!""  ""Yo, Maverick, I think we got caught in a jetwash!""

Sound familiar?  Well, what do you get if you take ""Top Gun,"" ""Fright Night,"" and maybe ""The Exorcist"" (my apologies to William Peter Blatty), mix them up and make a movie?  Well, a mess, of course.  But you also get ""Succubus,"" a film that will really suck the life out of you.  And probably about an hour and a half of your time.

Shot with an HD camcorder (most likely) bought off this site, the production values are, well, values.  'Cause they surely didn't spend much to get those values.  It is in 16 x 9, but it still streamed cropped through my Roku 1080P box.  The audio is legible but nothing special, and some of the music gave me a chuckle or two.

I did get a good laugh out of the Gary Busey character here.  What I want to know is:  what was with the cat litter in the back of his SUV next to the crossbow and silver arrows?  Surely they could have removed the cat litter before shooting, or was that supposed to be comic relief?  Or perhaps do you need cat litter to kill a succubus?  I don't know, and hopefully, I never find out.

I needed to watch a movie with a Succubus in it for believe-it-or-not research purposes, and this was the only one that I could find on Amazon that was available through streaming.  So that was why I selected this devilishly-bad film.  Oh, well.  I did get a few laughs, but hopefully I will forget about this movie very soon.  Like now.  What did I just watch?",1363564800,2,1522,4.122866894197952
2745169,5,B000MRNWKQ,"First things first: Yes, the succubus is hot but she's only part of the reason I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a little silliness now and then. This movie is very funny and NOT to be taken seriously.  I found the succubus' very human attitude and playfully wicked spitefulness particularly charming.  The poor schmuck who stumbles into her trap never had a chance. She methodically ruins every aspect of his life but he had it coming. Solid acting all around with a few guest star appearances.  Much better than I thought it would be, this flick is definitely worth the little money it cost.",1319414400,3,605,4.688679245283019
2745170,3,B000MRNWKQ,"I saw this on YouTube.  It was ok, but not enough happened in it.  It would have been better if it were faster paced, even if it had to be shorter to make that happen.

I don't think I would pay for it, but it's worth watching for free on YouTube.  I might even watch it again some time.",1304726400,,287,3.8135593220338984

2745172,1,B000MRNWKQ,"Lilith deserves better treatment and portrayal than a C-grade movie. If not for sexy Natalie Denise Sperl and her well-chosen tight, body hugging costume, this movie ought to be redone with better research and hotter action.

Natalie Denise Sperl plays Lilith the Succubus who comes into a playboy's life and teaches him what commitment really means! If the aim of the movie is a lesson to playboys, it doesn't deliver the message enough.

The producers did one thing almost right: the Succubus summoning spell used in the movie mimics an actual spell! It's been modified of course.

Summoning such demons are a very easy thing to do. The unfortunate thing that people have to deal with is banishing them. You can't banish Succubi with garlic, guns, nunchakus, cartoon medallions - those last secenes in the movie need to be redone! Looks like someone wanted to rush through the production. Rigid plastic props as wings for Succubus Lilith? Ha, ha, ha!

I can produce a better movie than this one!

Playboys beware! The next hot girl you pick up, use and dump could be the most sticky ride of your lives!

Lilith and her Succubi companions are already here on earth. Does anyone want their numbers? :-)",1239667200,5,1202,4.810679611650485
2745173,3,B000MRNWKQ,"The film's headliners (Keith, Busey, Lamas) are there as little more than walk-ons.  It is carried with surprising effectiveness by Robert L. Mann as the spoiled rich kid.  His friend, played by Jayson Blair, should also have a future.  The film seems to have some problems deciding just what it's attitude towards Lillith is.  Is she reeking vengeance on selfish playboys for all wronged women or is she just an evil being mindlessly pursuing the kid.  Her dominatrix costuming is nice, if a bit cliched.  It has it's  moments, unfortunately not many, but Mann and Blair show real promise.",1238198400,,590,4.898989898989899

2745175,1,B000MRNWKQ,"As one person wrote the chicks are hot, this is true, but you don't see much of them except the Succubus, and even then only briefly

This film can't decide if she's demonic, or demented as she has some super-natural power of her victim - but it seems like only some of the time. And when she takes on her rivals for his affection she resorts to some very human efforts, such as smashing a bottle over someone's head.",1177891200,9,417,4.2784810126582276

8171406,5,B000MRNWKQ,"The movie is a fun campy college horror flick. Lilith isn't the only hot chicks in the movie. The lead singer and dancers at the beach resort were smoking hot. And the song lead singer/dancer, Suhila, wrote was catchy. ""Cutie with a Bootie.""
Cameo of Gary Busey was definitely the funniest part. And yes the cat litter was supposed to be funny.
Not a real serious movie, but make up some popcorn and turn out the lights for some lighthearted action scary movie night. My guess this will turn out to be a classic.",1489276800,,512,4.457446808510638
