7038590,5,B00UGQ1X22,"It works. I have both p90x and this, and dedicating 60 minutes was too much with my schedule, so I bought this. 10-15 minutes is do-able if you really want to get fit and not find excuses. We all have 10 minutes. You will be sore; you will feel stronger; you will see results...if you do the exercises daily.",1267920000,5,308,4.237288135593221
7038591,5,B00UGQ1X22,I think this dvd exercise workout has been great for me.  Tony really explains the exercises unlike some dvds.  You are also not jumping around the room trying to catch on to what he is teaching you like other dvds.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Well satisfied.,1264291200,4,265,4.458333333333333
7038592,3,B00UGQ1X22,"The workouts themselves are decent, but the ""10 Minutes"" is a little misleading. They don't include any sort of warm-up or cool-down so realistically it's more like 15. Unfortunately, Tony and his commentary are SO irritating I stopped using the videos after a few weeks. The last couple of times I could only stand it by muting the sound.

If you're looking for a short, effective workout, try Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. Not only do you get a great workout in a short amount of time, the workouts include a warm-up/cool-down AND Jillian doesn't make me want to hit the mute button. ;-)",1258502400,9,590,4.673076923076923

7038662,5,B00UGQ1X22,"Just getting back into working out after a (cough:several year) hiatus.  The workouts can be combined to make a more intense workout, or you can do just one if you are short on time or energy, so it helped even mentally thinking that it was ""accomplishable"" going into it.  I would definitely purchase again if you are new to working out, or short on time and like a structured workout that is adjustable with time and intensity.  However, if you are in decent exercise-shape to begin with, or you really work the video's and do at least two a day, you will probably need to move on to something more intense in a short amount of time.  I will keep these though, as I do like that I can mix and match them together depending on time available, and also combine with other videos so I can really tailor a program that works for me.",1433116800,3,830,4.335483870967742

7038705,3,B00UGQ1X22,"It's alright. Bought this one and the other DVD (for additional exercises) but didn't really take to them. I would have to do a few of the sessions to really feel something (which they recommended for optimal results), but I found myself becoming bored with the exercises and the audio track etc. Often times, he would have bands attached to the dorm frame or somewhere else where I couldn't replicate

When I did do several, I did feel sweaty and tired. Very good if you are short on time. I've started going to the gym more now (spending 1 hr +) and found that to be more beneficial.

What I had often done (since I didn't have the bands) I would swap them in for small dumbbells (5-10lbs) and found those made the workouts a lot harder",1431216000,2,738,4.37956204379562

If you only have a short time to work out, pop this in and do it. Ten minutes of exercise is better than 0 minutes. You probably won't lose weight just doing 10 minutes a day, but if you're in a busy time of your life when doing full 60 minute work outs aren't realistic these are a great way to keep some level of fitness.",1419465600,9,492,4.030612244897959

I almost felt like you need to somewhat be on the fitness train already in order to begin this program.  I hope to get there at some point, but right now, it's not going to happen.  Good luck to those of you who can take this on because if your fit enough to handle it, it would appear to be a great program",1416873600,,427,3.9302325581395348

7038797,4,B00UGQ1X22,"To begin with, I got this program to get into back into the shape I was before I fractured my collarbone which basically resulted in gaining 20 pounds of unwanted fat over the next 12 weeks.

To get in shape, if you haven't done any kind of intense cardio or endurance training for a long time, this can be a good stepping stone. The 10 minute workouts will get your heart-rate up and they will make you sweat.  Although, like some reviewers have mentioned, not all the exercises are for beginners.

The abdominal routine was especially tough because it includes a lot of planking moves that require good balance and strong upper and lower body support just to maintain before you even do the exercise. In a lot of cases, however, they demonstrate a modified version of the move that will make it easier.

My advice to people is to do what Tony says, ""Do your best, and forget the rest."" If you can't keep up with Tony and the fitness models then don't. Go at your own pace but make sure you keep moving. I just finished my third week, I'm not overweight, and I still have to stop and take breaks from time to time. I usually jog in place or do an oversimplified version of the move until I build up steam again.

My biggest complaint is the focus on lower body exercises. If you suck at lunges and squats like me then you will dread any day that includes the lower body video. This is because if you're also doing a set of Cardio or Core Cardio, these routines also have a lot of hopping and lunging that is difficult when your legs are already fried. I hate it, but it is getting results.

Also, the 10-minute title is misleading, as others have said. While 10-minutes is great if it's all the time you have, you need to do at least 2 routines a day to get any fast results. The program recommends 3 a day if you can manage it.

I will say that I like the program overall and I am seeing definite results after doing the routines for the last 3 weeks. However, it is getting repetitive and I would recommend splitting the cost with a friend or loved one, as the price is a bit steep for what you get.",1407456000,29,2102,4.266331658291457

7038802,3,B00UGQ1X22,"This works. I'll admit that.  I love the 10 minute work outs.  Tony is a good motivator and it's so easy to do.  I gave it three stars because it's so damn expensive!  And I bought it for $29.  I can't imagine how burned I would feel if I spent $100 on it, and got $20 of extras with it.  Most people have that stuff at home anyway.
This workout is great for people who don't have time, don't have motivation, or don't really want to work out.  It will kick your butt!  This is good, my butt needs kicking, but the price?  Way over priced in my book!",1404518400,2,550,3.9724770642201834

7038835,1,B00UGQ1X22,"Tony calls it 10 minute trainer but the advised schedule to start the program contains combinations of up to three different 10 minute segments on any given day. Also, if you choose the play option of ""with warm up and cool down"" the segment is no longer ten minutes. I get the idea here. Lure people in with the idea they can get by with ten minutes a day, get them into working out, and they will start working out for longer periods. There are two truths involved: 1) You can't get fit on 10 minutes a day, and 2) This is not really a 10 minute a day program. Further, the goal of getting workouts in to a 10 minute period makes the workouts very frenetic, including the cueing. Once you get familiar with the exercises and sequence this would obviously lessen. Tony's old P90 Master Series level 1-2 is a much better place to start. I have also done the P90-X program but to start there a beginning exerciser needs to ""bring it.""",1399507200,45,933,4.337142857142857

8706065,5,B00UGQ1X22,"I LOVE this workout. I rarely use DVD #2 in the package as I enjoy doing ALL of the 10 minute workout sessions from DVD #1 in one shot: Total Body, Upper Body, Lower Body and ABS - Why am I doing this? Because Tony is so positive, at the end of one session you want to keep pushing yourself... testing yourself to see how much more you can do. (One workout is a challenge in itself and you will feel the difference) I get bored easily and this workout is never boring. Tony is super handsome and pleasant to listen to, he makes you laugh and is enjoyable to watch. His instructions are clear and never too wordy. The pace is great, he keeps a good flow. It truly feels like you're with your own personal trainer. He tackles every muscle and makes you work, but strangely feels like fun. The stretch band is great, however I like to use dumb bells (4lbs and 8lbs) as I find it easier to switch into each workout. Both are equally challenging! YOU WILL SWEAT!! In fact, after just two days, my body began to change. My stomach, butt, thighs, hips, back, arms... all got firmer and stronger fast. You will be sore the first week but keep it up... before you know it, you're shrinking! As a woman, we're always concerned with bulking up... well this does not bulk you up, it shreds the fat and tones you lean. After 2.5 weeks of 3 or 4 sessions per week, my clothes are looser and I feel amazing. I will continue with these workouts as they really do kick a$$. I'm going to put on that hot little jumpsuit in time for 4th of July!! Thank you Tony Horton for making me feel like my sexy self again. :^D",1497484800,,1597,4.2052117263843645
