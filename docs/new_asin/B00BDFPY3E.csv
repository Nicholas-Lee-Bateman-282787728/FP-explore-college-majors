8566680,2,B00BDFPY3E,"There's enough content here to get the viewer started with Strain/Counterstrain. However, this is a very expensive video considering the severe lack of production and relative lack of quality and content. The video is shot during a lecture and practice session. Most of the video consists of a stationary camera looking out over a room full of practicing attendees, with no clear shot of what anyone is doing.

Much of what there is to glean from the video is verbal in nature, so the lack of effective camera shots doesn't destroy the content. Luckily, you can still hear the presenter when he's out of frame, which is often. There's not a lot of demonstration, and, when there is, it's often difficult to see.

There are far, far superior resources on the topic, such as ""Positional Release"" (DVD) by Real Bodywork, or ""Orthobionomy"" (book) by  Kathy L. Kain and Jim Berns. I'd hoped this video would contain greater depth and more science than those two resources, but it didn't. Maybe a little more time discussing proprioception here than in the 2 sources mentioned above, but not enough to make this a particularly good resource.

Decent content, but not for the price. It certainly doesn't contain any information that can't be found elsewhere with better production and content.

Two stars instead of just one because there is SOME decent content, so I don't HATE it. I certainly could've come up with better things to do with the money.",1386201600,5,1445,4.857723577235772
