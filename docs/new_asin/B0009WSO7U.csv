2330179,5,B0009WSO7U,This DVD is an excellent material for those people looking to improve swimming skills (if you are an amateur). I specially liked the section of slow motion movements in which you can see the details of the swimming techniques,1123718400,26,225,4.794871794871795
8068700,5,B0009WSO7U,I received this product promptly. The video was accurately described and was very helpful in assisting my dtr in developing her stroke.,1303603200,,135,5.181818181818182
8068701,4,B0009WSO7U,"This video is great for strokes, but gives no information about starts or turns.  For the price, I was hoping for a little bit more.",1295222400,,132,4.28
8068702,5,B0009WSO7U,I bought this to supplement my training (started swimming at age 35).  Over the past year I have found it a great DVD to refer to time and time again.  The slow-mo and drill sections are particularly helpful.,1264636800,,208,4.447368421052632
8068703,4,B0009WSO7U,"This video hits its mark as a supplement to one's coaching.  Olympic level swimmers demonstrate key focus points for ""whole-body swimming"" each stroke.  The student is advised to watch repeatedly and take a mental image with them to practice of what correct form looks like in each competitive stroke.

Has helped immensely with my 7 & 8 Y.O. children who swim on a summer-only team and get very limited hands-on coaching.

Note that the swimmers swim at an IM tempo.  The slo-mo section is a useful bonus.

If you're looking for drills and complete stroke lessons you probably ought to buy a series by Quick or Marsh, but this is a great and inexpensive way for one to supplement his coaching in all four strokes.",1214784000,2,714,4.672
8068704,5,B0009WSO7U,Excellent DVD.  I watched over and over again.,1176163200,,46,4.75
8068705,5,B0009WSO7U,"This is a great reference video for competitive swimmer, including age group swimer. It does not teach you how to swim a stroke step by step. It serves as a model swimer that you can learn from. The best part of this vedio is that you will never be getting bored of watching them swim, they swim such a beautiful style that is very enjoyable.

I have ""swim fast"" series which features Michael Phelps, Ed Moss, and Lindsay Benko. Again, those are for competitive swimmer. But I have to tell you, Kaitlin has the best Fly, Back and Free techniques. Erik is close second. In term of breast stroke, I vote for Ed Moss.

As a parent of age group swimer, I think the techniques are more important than raw power. I would not ask my kid to swim like Michael Phelps bacause Michael has a lot of power packed in his stroke and kids can not do that.

I also have the series of ""becoming a faster swimmer"", it is targeting for beginners. However, no one in their right mind would ask a complete beginner to swim in a vedio, right? I watched that series for two times and that is it. Once you know the contest, the instruction will become very boring.

My recommendation is to buy this vedio and a swimming instruction book. You can study the book to learn or teach how to swim a stroke, but watch the vedio to set a final learning target.",1167955200,18,1327,4.296
8068706,1,B0009WSO7U,"This DVD really has not much to offer. By comparison the video ""Swim Smarter, Swim Faster"" has everything I wanted. Check this out. It's available from Amazon as well. The following is the description:

Richard Quick and Skip Kenney, Stanford University's outstanding swimming coaches demonstrate in this exclusive instructional video the drills, techniques, and skill necessary to ""Swim Smarter, Swim Faster!""These 1988 U.S.A. Olympic swim coaches share their coaching secrets that have produced Olympic medalists, All-Americas, and 9 NCAA team championships!

World class as well as developing age group swimmers demonstrate these drills while the coaches comments on their technique.""Swim Smarter, Swim Faster"" is certain to improve your butterfly, freestyle, breast, and backstroke. Running time 60 min. / format VHS/NTSC",1152230400,6,998,6.078014184397163
8068707,4,B0009WSO7U,"Agree with Angela, this dvd is for those already possessing some skill but wanting to refine technics.  It is not for amateurs.

Kaitlin's perfect butterfly technic is so graceful, it doesn't look strenuous that I take that vision to the pool and practice.  Another plus point is it can be watched over and over again without being bored with too many instructions.",1146528000,4,365,4.854838709677419
8068708,3,B0009WSO7U,I liked the video but I would of liked more specific details about the strokes. I have alot of questions that still are not answered.,1140652800,5,133,4.36
8068709,3,B0009WSO7U,"....this DVD does NOT teach you the stroke step by step from the beginning.  This DVD is most useful if you already have a certain amount of skill with each on the strokes and want to refine your TECHNIQUE.  In terms of refining your technique, this DVD does a good job.",1136937600,15,270,4.2745098039215685
