7991869,1,B00009IB4Q,"This 4 pack is really a 1 pack meaning that there is only 1 dvd inside and not 4.  Each side of the disc contains 2 movies and no extras.  The movies are presented in full screen and are NOT remastered.  Instead, the video quality is blurry and scratchy and the audio goes down and out at times.  This is because the movies here have been transferred from old VHS copies and onto this DVD.  Normally, I don't mind watching these types of films in full screen and in less than mint condition because I know that sometimes that's all that is available (some of the original prints have been lost or are not presently on the market for remastering), but this disc is unwatchable.  Most of the action scenes are so cropped that you can only see arms and legs or one person in the frame where originally you would have seen two whole bodies.  How can you enjoy an action film when you can't SEE the action?!!!  I've seen the Bruce Li movie that's on this DVD before on VHS and it wasn't as fuzzy as it is here so I know that that film is available in better condition elsewhere, and I'm sure the others are too since they're pretty famous Bruce-Lee-a-like titles.  Wait until you find them available as separate titles which usually means better picture quality.  Don't waste your money like I did!
  If you like Bruce Li, I highly recommend the film IRON DRAGON STRIKES BACK which has recently been made available on DVD and can be found at video stores for rent or to purchase.  It's a very good showcase for the underrated Ho Ching Tao (Bruce Li's real name) giving him a suspenseful, modern day story that is much more original than any of his Bruce Lee imitation titles and lets him display his above par martial arts skill and acting.",1066435200,7,1735,4.401253918495298
7991870,5,B00009IB4Q,"These are not the best films to honor Bruce Lee by a long shot,but they have their place in the history of the Lee legend.
Included are the following films-
1-B.L.'s Deadly Kung Fu-featuring Bruce Li and a young Hwang Jang Lee(Drunken Master).The plot merges elements from Lee's real life with pieces from Way of the Dragon. The combo is unque and action packed,especially the ending.
2-Big Boss 2-Features Dragon Lee. The supporting cast is strong with Bolo Yeung,Philip Ko and Cheung Nick. Lots of action.
3-Bruce's Fist of Vengeance-features Bruce Le. He is a bit annoying and the story is non-existent. But fighting is plentiful, albeit(unintentionally)comical. Le is stiff and robotic compared even to other Lee impersonators.
4-Clones of Bruce Lee-By far the funniest film ever released in the genre. From the premise,to the sets,to the action scenes, this film is a laugh riot. One clip in paticular has a villian testing out some Bronzemen,where they get whacked over the head repeatedly with an iron bar. It should be re-named 3 Dragon Stooges. Great stuff!
All of these films played in theatres 25 years ago,and they packed audiences in. Films like these did keep Bruce Lee's name in the public eye for quite a few years,so they did serve their purpose.
Overall the disc is cheap and you will definitely get your money's worth(under five dollars a film).
My suggestion is to get a few bags of popcorn and enjoy over a weekend with similar minded friends.",1063238400,4,1464,4.907258064516129
7991871,3,B00009IB4Q,"THIS DVD WHICH FEATURES BRUCE LEE'S IMITATORS WAS RELEASED FOR THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF BRUCE LEE'S UNTIMELY DEATH. THIS DVD HAS 4 MOVIES. SIDE A HAS ''BRUCE LEE'S DEADLY KUNG FU'' AND ''BRUCE'S FIST OF VENGEANCE'' WHILE SIDE B HAS ''THE CLONES OF BRUCE LEE'' AND ''THE BIG BOSS II''. HERE'S MY OPINION ON ALL THESE FLICKS;
SIDE A
''BRUCE LEE'S DEADLY KUNG FU'' -3 STARS- BEST MOVIE ON THE WHOLE DVD. TWO MEN BECOME THE TARGETS OF A LOCAL GANG. SUPRISINGLY, BRUCE LI WAS GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS A HUGE STEP UP IN THE ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT FOR BRUCE LI. FINALLY, BRUCE LI MANAGES TO HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE MOVIE. TOO BAD I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR MANY OF HIS OTHER MOVIES.
''BRUCE'S FIST OF VENGEANCE'' -2.5 STARS- A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR [BRUCE LE] IS THE TARGET OF A CRIME BOSS WHO WANTS A RARE BRUCE LEE BOOK THAT THE INSTRUCTOR POSSESSES. FAR FROM THE QUALITY OF THE REAL BRUCE LEE, BUT, I'VE SEEN MUCH WORSE.
SIDE B
''THE CLONES OF BRUCE LEE'' -1.5 STARS- AFTER BRUCE LEE DIES, A SCIENTIST MAKES 3 CLONES OF BRUCE LEE. STRAIGHT UP STUPID AND BORING. THE CLONES ARE PLAYED BY DRAGON LEE, BRUCE LE, AND BRUCE LAI. JUST A SERIES OF POINTLESS FIGHTS. I KNOW THE REAL BRUCE LEE WOULD BE MAD IF HE WERE ALIVE TO SEE HIS GREAT NAME BEING USED TO SELL BS MOVIES LIKE THIS.
''BIG BOSS II'' -2 STARS- A CHINESE MAN [DRAGON LEE] SETS OUT TO GET REVENGE FOR HIS MURDERED FATHER. THIS IN-NAME ONLY SEQUEL TO THE FISTS OF FURY IS SO-SO AT BEST, BUT, WHAT BRINGS IT DOWN IS ITS PLOT. IT'S BEEN DONE TOO MANY TIMES BEFORE.
OVERALL RATING; 3 STARS
AN OK COLLECTION. NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT IT'S OK. I WOULDN'T REALLY RECCOMEND THIS TO MARTIAL ARTS FANS. UNLESS OF COURSE, YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF THE BRUCE LEE WANNABES. IF YOU'RE EXPECTING TO SEE 4 EPIC MARTIAL ARTS FILMS, PUT THIS DVD BACK ON THE SHELF RIGHT NOW! FOR REAL, IT IS TRULY A SHAME HOW MANY DIRECTORS HAVE TRYED TO USE BRUCE LEE'S NAME TO MARKET BS MOVIES.",1061596800,3,1903,4.318435754189944
