1833173,5,B00008AOXD,"A little something about Faith, in my own words.
I am very fond of Faith and wanted to share my thoughts with other fans of this amazing lady.
I swear with each passing day I become more and more impressed with Faith. The more I see of this lovely lady, the more I hear her, her singing, her lyrics and her own completely candid words during interviews ect and the more I learn about her, the more I see what a truely wonderful, truely beautiful person Faith is. These days, you rarely come across people with these for-real qualities. A lot of people and in fact (I hate to admit it but) a lot of celebrities are expert at being well, fake. And I just don't 'see' this in Faith. I try to 'pick up' on it but can't. I can't because it's not there. This girl is all heart and solid beauty through and through. To the very core. The old saying ""beauty is only skin deep"" does not hold true in this case. Faith exudes beauty. Faith truely is an amazing, incredible human being. And in her ""When The Lights Go Down"" dvd, one does not have to look far or to hard to see this. (And I might add that this makes Tim McGraw (Faith's husband) just about the luckiest man alive).
Faith has made the 'transition' from flat-out country to a sort of, well I don't know what to call it, to tell you the truth. Pop? Rock? Country-pop-rock? I'm still not exactly sure which genre or catagory Faith's music would (now) fall under. But it certainly is beautiful music this beautiful girl makes and I hope the music never stops. And I will admit here and now that not one day goes by that I don't listen to Faith. I have her at home and in my truck. I can't seem to make it through the day without slipping in one of her cds.
Faith's ""When The Lights Go Down"" showing, I think is fantastic. I have seen this many times already and can tell you this... if you think you may like Faith Hill, you will LOVE her after seeing this a couple of times. And if you are already a Faith fan, do yourself a big favor and get her new DVD. You will be glad you did. In short, ""When The Lights Go Down' is a top-shelf, A-1, BEST-BUY all the way. And so is Faith.",1052179200,,2127,4.140096618357488
1833174,5,B00008AOXD,"I like Faith Hill, but for me, one of the big thrills of watching the special was seeing Dann Huff and hearing him play Faith's songs. Dann Huff is an AMAZINGLY talented guitarist and producer (he produced both She-Daisy albums and several of Faith Hill's songs on her last two albums). Dann had a band back in the late 80s and early 90s, and has played on other musicians' albums (was so excited when I heard his guitar on a Lou Gramm album back in the 90s). Since the early 90s I hadn't heard much of him and had never seen him play (live or on tape), but now that he's working with some big names I was hoping to see him play and on this special I got to see him! He's well worth watching for those who don't know who he is. The title song here really shows how this man can PLAY. Check him out on the guitar solo!",1050883200,6,817,4.049382716049383

1833229,5,B00008AOXD,Great show and music. We can't buy much of her show in Australia. If you love Faith Hill buy it.,1362700800,,96,3.85
1833230,5,B00008AOXD,Its not a live concert DVD. Its a collection of live video footage from different events. Given that - I really enjoyed it.,1270684800,,123,4.391304347826087

It was a good purchase.

1833232,4,B00008AOXD,"I am a huge Faith Hill fan, and generally enjoy anything relating to her. The behind the scenes footage is neat to see, and the costume changes, but I wish there had been full performances of all the songs, with the talk before or after, not during the song.  Still a must have for Faith Fans!!",1236643200,,294,4.25
1833253,5,B00008AOXD,"If you are a Faith Hill Fan, Rush to buy this Dvd. Some people complain about some of the talking in between the songs, but it's faith talking about her life, inspirations and behind the scene magic. Live performances of her songs from ""Cry"" kick butt. My favorite song is an acoustic version of ""Breathe"" with Carlos Santana! I watch this DVD almost every morning while getting ready for work, puts me in a good mood.",1118880000,5,418,4.5131578947368425
1833254,4,B00008AOXD,"This is a DVD of Faith Hill's Thanksgiving Special from 2002 to promote her CRY album. Fans will definately want this one. A lot of the songs get new arrangements. ""Let Me Let Go"" is given a new arrangement which makes it sound more like a gospel song, and they reworked ""This Kiss"" to sound more edgy and rock sounding. Her collaboration with Carlos Santana on ""Breathe"" was excellent. Let's not forget the show stopping performance of ""When The Lights Go Down"" which she just nails, she is really on with the vocals. Her performance of ""Cry"" is the best one I've heard her do other than on the album. There are two bonus songs which did not make the original broadcast, the nice ballad ""Stronger"" and the rocker ""Back To You"". Other songs she sings include ""This Kiss"", ""One"", ""There You'll Be"", ""If You're Gonna Fly Away"", and ""The Way You Love Me"". I dock 1 star because it's distracting to have the behind the scenes material dispersed between each song...that should have been a bonus feature instead on some songs it cuts into the song, it would have been nice to just have the performances and then the bonus material separate. Overall though, it's a nice DVD, especially if you are a fan of Faith's.",1072310400,8,1208,4.571428571428571
1833255,1,B00008AOXD,I bought the Faith Hill DVD to hear her sing but instead the songs were interrupted with talking.  I would rather have had the talking put to one side and be able to place the music uninterrrupted. Wish I could get my money back!!! So spend your money on another DVD.,1064016000,55,267,4.235294117647059
1833256,3,B00008AOXD,"This dvd is chopped up by interrupting several of the performances. This behind the scenes footage is ok between songs, but literally intrudes into some of the songs. Would have
been much better if the performances were uninterrupted, and you could access directly to the start of each song. The behind
the scenes stuff is ok the first time you watch, but after that you are still forced to watch it. Someone made a big mistake with this idea. If they wanted to include the behind the scenes stuff, it should have been added at the end as ""bonus footage"".
However, when you get Faith Hill singing, it is great.",1060041600,42,610,4.554545454545455
1833257,3,B00008AOXD,"As a fan of faith hill, this DVD get a low rating from me. There is no doubt her voice are fantastic but she get to much commercial in promoting of her.
If you expect to enjoy a great concert without interruption I can't recommand to buy this DVD. Through the ""concert"" it switch from concert to studiorecordings with interruption of backstage material.
It's sad that many producers of concert-DVD's don't seperate backstage and interview material from the concert-part.",1056585600,3,470,4.962025316455696
1833258,5,B00008AOXD,"After seeing this Thanksgiving special on NBC I was anticipating a DVD. Some of the highlights were very notable. ""Let Me Let Go"" was reformulated to have a Gospel feel to it and Faith sounded amazing singing it - it took me back to church! ""This Kiss"" was reworked to have a pop edge with new drum beats. ""One"" is a funky/bluesy song that Faith nailed. Included on the DVD that did not origianlly air were two songs: ""Stronger,"" which is my favorite song of her album Cry, was just beautiful and ""Back to You"" rocked the house. But the lasting impression from the DVD is Faith's duet with Carlos Santana. They collaberated on her smash-hit ""Breathe"" which was the best performance of this song that I have heard her sing. With no music to over-shadow her voice, it was just Faith, Carlos and a band of guitars....WOW!
I recommend this DVD to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1055116800,12,863,4.6103896103896105

I recommend this DVD to anyone and I would love for there to be another DVD released of her concert she conducted for CMT Live back in 1998. That was even better then ""When the Lights Go Down.""  By the way, what's with Kathleen Hendrick's stealing my review and using it as her own???",1053302400,10,1103,4.46039603960396
1833260,5,B00008AOXD,Let me start by saying that Faith Hill is one of Country music's greatest artists.  I have seen Faith live in concert multiple times and thought no dvd could come close to showing in her maximum capacity but this comes pretty close.  Even though this dvd doesn't really show any fan interaction and seems to be Faith and a bunch of TV producers and what not it is still a wonderful dvd for an avid Faith fan such as myself.  The dvd extras are a must also.  If you saw this when it originally aired and liked it then this dvd is a must for your Faith collection and well-worth the money.,1052697600,3,587,4.214285714285714
1833261,5,B00008AOXD,"For me, its hard to time whenthe commercials end, and when the show starts again.  So, in this case, having a DVD of Faith's Thanksgiving Special is about the best way to go!!  I am an avide Faith collector and tape every single show without commercials.  Along with the continuious coverage of Faith and her crew, you get to see back behind the camera footage, and rare pictures of Faith and Tim with Gracie and Maggie.  I think its an exceptional work of art, personally, and also the extra songs, Stronger and Back To You (both personal favorites of mine) are captured live.  I think that its an amazing look into the world of making a TV special and the ture life of Faith and her family.  Also, my daughter, Faith, loves watching Faith perform on ANYTHING!",1052438400,2,761,4.518248175182482

7981119,3,B00008AOXD,This is not really what I thought it was going to be.  I thought it was going to be a concert dvd.  When she performs live on stage  it's good.  And she does songs like This Kiss and Breathe.  But when she's not singing there is too behind the scenes stuff.  Someon needs to come out with just a concert dvd of her.,1501891200,,315,3.9206349206349205

7981125,5,B00008AOXD,"Yes there is a lot of backstage footage, but I liked that too as it provides some insight into how the productions are altered and why Faith Hill is one of the best performers, attention to detail and relationship with everyone involved. While I would prefer that they didn't get interlaced with the onstage performance, Faith is still Faith and the onstage performances were spectacular. Her exceptional voice, range, and emotion she puts into each one really makes this DVD worth every penny.",1440201600,,494,4.963855421686747
