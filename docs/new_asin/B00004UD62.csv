A great little movie. OK it is dine on a shoe string budget, yet the acrobatics showing yoga kung fu from India is something very unique.

It's a rare chance to see an asian movie that wasn't going to be released, fortuitously it was.

Just sit back, relax and enjoy the expertise where no stuntmen are involved.

Sometimes we have to use suspended belief or just accept that the quality 30 years ago is not state of the art.

Anyhow, it can be viewed on youtube.",1307577600,,631,5.6

The amazing Shien Yie Kwon (Soft Bone) kung fu, which originates with Yoga from India, is the main attraction in this terrific actioneer. See how a man and a woman, who both possess this extraordinary skill, counter their foes with this most unique style of kung fu fighting. YOGA AND KUNG FU GIRL is an eye-opening delight that will have kung fu fans breaking their backs with joy!",1256601600,,428,4.571428571428571
7923806,1,B00004UD62,"The first review I gave on this DVD was removed because I told the absolute truth concerning this dreadful kung fu flick.  This DVD should be burned totally.  Do not waste your time in purchasing this. You'll only end up angry and out of money.  It's not worth the disc it was copied to.  It should have remained in the archives.  This flick is utter garbage.  The acting was horrible, the overdubs sucked, and the plot was utterly stupid!  It personally deserves less than one star. If you get this one, don't say you were not warned.  I don't want to see anyone else become a victim!

I totally agree with the previous viewer.  I should have read the review before purchasing this rubbish.",1124928000,2,691,4.5
7923807,1,B00004UD62,"Okay, so what review do you want first? The movie or the DVD?
I'll start with a movie. In a word: awful! Thank Gods (if there are any) there is a FF button. The plot is so stupid I won't spend time even trying to re-tell it here... I don't expect a lot from an martial arts movie, but hey! It's got to be there! Furthermore, fight choreographies are dumb and execution so poor you wouldn't believe it. This movie could only be liked by kids (with low IQ-s) or martial arts TV-nerds...
The only thing (maybe) worth watching is the girl-contortionist doing contortion during training or fights, and I'm telling there are much better and more beautiful contortion videos to buy or simply download from the web...
Now... the DVD itself. ""Oh boy, what a joy!""
Picture and sound are so bad it looks like someone put a VHS camera in the theater and taped it there. Looking for extra features? Don't. There aren't any. How about the paper with name of the chapters. Don't bother. Like, who needs it?
And that would be it. There goes twelve bucks down the drain...",1010534400,18,1055,4.471502590673575
