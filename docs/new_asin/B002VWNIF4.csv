4002083,4,B002VWNIF4,"This was a good pay per view effort from WWE.  There was not a single bad match on the show, and the booking had some twists and turns that one normally would not expect from wwe.  Nothing on this show really blew me away, but there was nothing to complain about either.  The only thing that hurt this show was the crowd, because they were absolutely dead for much of this show, even in the big main event matches, but you can't blame the performers for that.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. ECW Championship Ladder Match
Christian (C) vs. Shelton Benjamin

This was a really good opener.  Crowd was pretty quiet but they did manage to pop for the big dangerous spots, of which there were plenty.  Christian got busted open hardway by a ladder and had to be stitched up during the match.  Shelton was his usual death defying self here, he really shines in these types of matches, as does Christian.  Very good match, wound up being the best match on the show, in my opinion.  ***3/4

2. Intercontinental Title Match
John Morrison (c) vs. Drew McIntyre

Pretty good match.  The crowd didn't care one iota but they had a better than average match.  Worth a look.  **1/2

3.  Women's Title Match
Michelle McCool (c) vs. Mickie James

Better than most women's matches, but that is expected because these two are probably the best female workers wwe has.  There were some good near falls, and the crowd was actually getting into it by the end.  In the end this was really just filler, but at least it was decent filler.  **1/2

4. WWE Championship Tables Match
John Cena (c) vs. Sheamus

Having this match take place on this spot in the card made the outcome somewhat predictable.  That being said, they had a much better match than I expected and I thought Sheamus did a really good job as a heel.  Crowd was into this match more than anything else on the show.  Both guys worked hard and they had a good title match, one of many title changes on the show.  At least they're finally following through on somebody's push.  ***

5. World Heavyweight Championship Chairs Match
Undertaker (c) vs. Batista

All this was was a chairs are legal match.  You could hear crickets chirping during this match, the crowd was so quiet, which really hurt the match.  To be honest, this was pretty slow going until the end, but they had some good near falls.  Batista won the title after a low blow and a chair shot, but Teddy Long came out and reversed the decision, and Undertaker quickly won with a chair shot and a Tombstone.  Finish hurt the match a little, but the match was nothing special either way.  **1/4

6. Randy Orton vs. Kofi Kingston

Kofi was super over after this program initially began, but they have done such a bad job with it from that point on that he was seen as just another guy here by the crowd.  It didn't help matters that Orton won relatively clean.  Match was pretty good but nothing special, I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.  **1/2

7. Unified Tag Team Championship Tables Ladders and Chairs Match
Big Show (c) and Chris Jericho (c) vs. Shawn Michaels and Triple H

Very long match, and the crowd had no sustained heat throughout, which was odd considering how over these two teams are.  That being said, this was a very good main event with a clever finish.  There were the usual tag team ladder match spots, but they also did some innovative stuff as well, not to mention dangerous.  Good finish to the show, and at least the crowd was sent home happy.  ***1/2

This wasn't a great show, but there were no bad matches whatsoever.  I don't necessarily recommend purchasing this on dvd, but I do suggest renting it, because the show as a whole was quite enjoyable with some high quality wrestling.",1260662400,2,3731,4.472511144130758

4002094,3,B002VWNIF4,"With all the gimmick themed PPV events lately, it's starting to get a bit tiresome. TLC 2009 actually delivered a good card however, unlike the abomination Hell in a Cell PPV.

1. Ladder Match- Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin(ECW Championship)= They vowed to steal the show. Everybody expected them to steal the show. But they couldn't quite get the job done. It was good, but it wasn't great. Looking at the ladder match resumes of both guys, it should've been great. I'm not a fan of blood stoppages, but this was the absolute worst, as it totally killed the flow of the match, the in-ring psychology, and the crowd. It took them some effort to win the crowd back. But they did get there with some unique spots and good action. However, we got good, but we wanted great. A disappointment. 3 out of 5.

2. John Morrison vs. Drew McIntyre(WWE Intercontinental Championship)= This match was a surprise. I really enjoyed it alot and it comes off as one of the better ones on the card. They had some unique moves, and some good twists on the usual spots we see in one of their matches. A pleasant surprise. 4 out of 5.

3. Michelle McCool vs. Mickie James(WWE Womens Championship)= This match was the result of the one of the more distasteful storylines WWE has put out in a long time. I did expect a bit more from these two, but it wasn't bad by any means. It was just there. Worth a watch, nothing more.  2 out of 5.

4. Tables Match- John Cena vs. Sheamus(WWE Championship)= A one on one tables match might seem a little awkward and unexciting, but they did a pretty good job here. This continued Sheamus' massive push, and at the time, he might or might not have deserved it, but no one can deny his character development was very well done, and this match was good enough to keep his roll going. 3 out of 5.

5. Chairs Match- Undertaker vs. Batista(World Heavyweight Championship)= These two showed they are capable of having great matches with each other back in 2007, but this was surprisingly bad. Nothing exciting happened, it went on too long for its own good, and I still don't get the purpose of a Chairs match. A major disappointment, you'd be best off to skip it. 1 out of 5.

6. Kofi Kingston vs. Randy Orton= Kofi's feud with Orton made him look like a bonafide star, and this was a very good match to live up to the quality storyline, even though I feel the wrong man won this one. Good ring psychology, good finishing sequence and a very cool dropkick spot make this one to watch. 4 out of 5.

7. Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match- JeriShow vs. DX(WWE Unified Tag Team Championship)= Match of the night, and really the only gimmick match to deliver up to the hype. My only gripe is maybe more table use was needed, but still a great match. A nice and unique finish adds to the match, and this one is just a good watch all the way through. Don't expect a TLC match on the level of the classics from The Dudleys, Hardys and Edge and Christian however. 4 out of 5.

So, nothing perfect, but a good, solid card with some enjoyable matches. Worth a look.",1280534400,,3062,4.405309734513274

Ladder match for the ECW championship
Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin
This was a very good match and a great way to start off a very extreme night. This was fast paced, very brutal, and had some great moments that could have stole the show. This match had moments like benjamin getting on the top of a ladder and then doing the wrestlemania 25 flip onto christian and almost breaking his back, and a huge frogsplash onto benjamin from the top rope and right through a ladder. This match is very entertaining and is a edge of your seat match with tons of joey styles OH MY GOD!!! Moments.
4.5/5

Intercontinental championship
John Morrison vs. Drew McIntyre
This match is also another good match on this card. This match had some fast paced moments with one of the most botched moves i have ever seen. These two had a pretty good rivalry going and put on a good match. I didn't like that Drew won, but, it was a perfect opportunity for McIntire to get the win after morrison missed a starship pain.
3.5/5

Womens championship
Mickie James vs. Michelle McCool
What a boring match. I hated this match the entire time. This was very boring and like all other diva matches, slow. This match was a filler and not watchable.
1/5

Tables match for the WWE championship
John Cena vs. Sheamus
Wow. I had no idea that this match would be good. These two put on a great match with a great buildup to go along. The ending is very dissapointing and very sad because sheamus wins with cena falling from the second rope and going through a table. I liked the brutality and how the match was back and forth the entire match. This match had some good weapon use and is very enjoyable and has tons of action.
4.5/5

Chairs match for the WWE championship
Undertaker vs. Batista
This isn't a very good match either. These two have had many great matches when they had rivalrys, but this was the worst encounter between these two. I didn't like that batista won with a cheap lowblow, and that the match got restarted, and undertaker getting a quick win. This match was very short, unlike their other matches. This match is watchable, but not worth watching.
3.5/5

Randy Orton vs. Kofi Kingston
This is their best encounter yet. These two put on a great match, but was a little short. I like the action and some great moments in this match like orton getting a dropkick on the outside in midair, the punt to the arm, and a missed trouble in paradise leading to a huge RKO. I really like this match and thought it was a great way to lead up to the main event and the best match on the card.
4/5

Tables, Ladders, and Chairs for the Unified Tag-Team championships
DX vs. JeriShow
This match definatly deserved to be the main event. This match had tons of chair and ladder use and is very brutal. I liked that this match pretty much started on the entrance way very early in the match. This match was a finisher fest, everybody got their finishers on each other. Some great moments like triple h and shawn being cokeslammed together through a table, big show getting jericho on his sholders while trying to get the belts, two sweet chin musics in a row, big show breaking a ladder in half, and DX winning their first tag titles. This match is fast paced and fifty/fifty  and very enjoyable.
5/5

This ppv was a great way to end 2009 and had a lot of very good and surprisingly good matches. I recomend this ppv to your wwe collection.",1279152000,6,3526,4.429012345679013
4002096,3,B002VWNIF4,"WWE's December pay-per-view, TLC 2009, does not quite deliver the way I hoped it would.  It seemed as though the potential for what could have been, was much greater than the finished product.

ECW Title
Ladder Match
Christian vs Shelton Benjamin
What was probably the best choice for an opener, still did not shape up to be a great opener.  The crowd does not seem to be into this match at all, which does not help it.  The match drags from spot to spot with alot of filler in between.  The spots are range from decent to good.  Christian gets busted open about half way through which really kills the crowd and momentum.  A very strong spot at the end does not make up for the half decent match though.  6/10

Intercontinental Title
Drew McIntyre vs John Morrison
There's not a whole lot going on in this match.  McIntyre's offense drags, while Morrison comes up with good combinations of offense occasionally.  At 10 minutes, this one could have been shorter.  4.5/10

Women's Championship
Michelle McCool vs Mickie James
The same as any other women's match you've seen on Raw.

WWE Championship
Tables Match
John Cena vs Sheamus
Sheamus's first big dance turned out to be an okay one.  A good way to describe this match would be to coin it as ""a light-brawl"".  The fight up the ramp and back, outside the ring and back, and trade some pretty good offense inside the ring.  None of it gets too intense though (hence the term ""light"").  The ending is somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic, which hurts it.  Crowd seems stunned.  6.5/10

World Heavyweight Title
Chair Match
Undertaker vs Batista
This one was really disappointing.  We have seen these two put on classics (Wrestlemania 23) and we have seen them try to match it with good matches (Cyber Sunday 2007) and we have seen them offer up something different, but great (Survivor Series 2007).  To be honest, I had high hopes.  I was expecting something between their Wrestlemania ecounter and their Hell in a Cell at Survivor Series.  What we got was not a dud, but it was close.  They can't seem to find their groove as this one drags on for 14 minutes.  The chair comes into play some, but nothing worth noting or even really remembering.  5/10

Randy Orton vs Kofi Kingston
This match I really enjoyed.  I did not think I would either.  Orton and Kofi trade very good offenses between each other.  The match has small moments of down time as Orton does hit ""viper"" gimmick, but it did not really hurt the match at all.  It was very entertaining and probably had the best psychology/story telling of any match this night.  7.5/10

Tag Titles
TLC Match
Jerishow vs DX
When you think TLC main event at a pay-per-view titled TLC, you think big spots, hard action, and a great match.  This just did not deliver.  The end result it simply ""okay"".  There are no big spots at all within the match.  The crowd was definitely way into this match though.  There are some okay moments with all three weapons, but nothing worth phoning home about.  All four men were talented enough to keep you into the match, but I won't remember it forever.  6.5/10",1274745600,,3096,4.595238095238095

4002099,3,B002VWNIF4,"ECW Heavyweight Champion Christian Vs. Shelton Benjamin (Ladder Match) - Weeks prior to this match, Christian stated that ECW was going to steal the show on this night and that's exactly what they did here. About four minutes into the match, Christian gets busted open above his right eye which he had to get stitched up (during the match) causing the match to be set on paused for a brief period of time. From there, Christian and Shelton put on their own individual highlight reels taking numerous dives and falls off the ladder including Shelton catching Christian in mid air and powerbombing him into a ladder at one point. These two guys even doing dives onto a ladder which showcases Christian frog splashing Shelton in the closing moments of the match and destroying the ladder in the process. The only negative I can say about this match is the match being stopped so the EMT could clean up Christian but other then that, this match was very good. 4/5

WWE Intercontinental Champion John Morrison Vs. Drew McIntyre - This match played out very well as it was strictly a pure wrestling match differing itself from the opening bout. McIntyre stuck mostly to the matbased offense opposing himself from Morrison's risky, diversed style. The match was wrestled at a good pace with the crowd getting more involved as the match progressed into a very good I-C Title showdown between these two very young, gifted competitors. 3.75/5

WWE Women's Champion Michelle McCool Vs. Mickie James - For a gal who screws around with the Undertaker off camera, Michelle McCool surely admires TNA's AJ Styles quite a bit. But back to subject, this Women's Title match played out just how it was suppost to coming off the ""Piggy James"" comments. This match started out real intense with Mickie wanting to get payback for those disgraceful (but yet funny) ""Piggy James"" comments. After the intense start, the match didn't stay like that for quite a bit until the closing minutes of the match where these two divas got very physical on the outside until a distraction from Layla where Michelle is able capitalize and able to retain her Women's Championship over Mickie James. 3/5

WWE Champion John Cena Vs. Sheamus (Tables Match) - It has been said before and I'll say it again, Cena's best performances are in these ""No Rules"", brawling type matches. For being a new comer, Sheamus performed very well too being placed on the biggest stage of his career. Like the previous match, this match started out real intense with Cena controlling the offense until Sheamus is able to turn the tables around and begin to dominate the match and eventually introducing the tables to the match. This was a good brawl among the two with the end being somewhat a ""judgmental call"" coming off Jerry Lawler's and Matt Striker's comments but in any case, a dawn of a new day was born in Sheamus becoming the new WWE Champion. 3.5/5

World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker Vs. Batista (Chairs Match) - Coming off a great series back in 2007-2008 over the same championship, these two didn't seem to match up to par on this night where it looked like both guys were having an off night. This match felt to be highly a step down from their previous encounters and for being the first of its kind, this ""Chairs Match"" didn't have much to offer. Hardly any buildup to any of the spots at all and to top things, Teddy Long coming out reversing the referee's decision and restarting the match didn't help matters either. From where I stand, barely an average match. 3.25/5

Kofi Kingston Vs. Randy Orton - Possibably having the best buildup then any other bout on the card, I truly believe this match lived up to those creditials but yet at the same time I also think the way this match played out, it did not help Orton that much and morely so it did not help Kofi at all. But how you want to look at it, you can consider this match being Kofi's ""breakout"" match as he dropped the whole Jamaican character and started to morph into his own. Kofi started out real aggressive but maybe too aggressive as Orton was able to dropkick Kofi in mid air on the outside at one point causing Orton's ""Viper"" character to come into play and begin to pick away the bones by focusing on the ribs of Kofi. Overall, this was a very competitve contest between the two with Kofi doing wonders for Orton all throughout the match. But in the end, it was Orton able to pick up his first clean pin fall victory in quite some time after delivering a devastating RKO. 3.75/5

WWE Unified Tag Team Champions Jeri-Show Vs. DX (TLC Match) - After three years of being on and off, the team of HBK and HHH was set out to achieve the one title that has aluted them as a duo over the years. The four started the match out with an intense brawl that started in the ring but soon moved up to the staging area where the weapons got introduced. From there, The Big Show did most of the heavy duty butt kickin' just mauling DX and destroying numerous ladders in the process. The ending involving the smart but idiotic teamwork of Chris Jericho and Big Show that back fired causing Jericho to take a nasty fall onto a table with DX shortly able to climb the ladder and gain the Tag Team Championship. This was good match for what its worth but do not expect the spotfesty and crash and burn spots in this one as this TLC match was moreso an all out brawl between the two teams but they gave enough excitement to have left you watching a good match. 4/5

""TLC"" was a good PPV for me. As for the match quality, top to bottom, it surley in my eyes tops WWE's earlier new PPV concepts in Breaking Point and Hell In A Cell (haven't seen Bragging Rights). But overall, I recommend this as a rental at best.",1263340800,4,5729,4.545542635658915
4002100,4,B002VWNIF4,"Ladder Match: ECW Champion Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin - With the ECW brand being lost in the shuffle for the past couple of PPV's (which Christian openily admitted weeks earlier), they came back with a bang here with the two men who have their own highlight reels when it comes to ladder matches.  Michael Cole described this match just right in the end when he called it a ""thriller"" because you just had so many moments such as various moves done off the ladder (flying clothesline, powerslam, scorpion deathdrop) and done onto the ladder (frog splash) and one moment where Shelton showed heavy strength by catching Christian off the ladder into a powerbomb onto another one.  The only thing I can really say that was negative here was when Christian got busted open at one point & the match was stopped so the EMT can attend to it leading the crowd to chant ""WE WANT BLOOD.""  Despite that one negative, they did what they acomplished to do & that's steal the show.

Intercontinental Champion John Morrison vs. Drew McIntyre - This was a different type of match than the previous match as this was more of a normal wrestling match with Drew using a more matbased offense as opposed to how Morrison uses a more diverse combination style.  It was hard to follow up the previous match as the crowd was mostly dead for this match as it started off real show but picked up the pase overtime as these two young guys put together a good above average contest.

Womens Champion Michelle McCool vs. Mickie James - Before I get started, someone tell Michelle to leave ""boxer"" attire with the rest of Marc Mero's leftovers?  Just based off the buildup they had for weeks with all the ""Piggy James"" comments, this match played out exactly how it should have in the beginning as it was real intense to the point where the opening moments had a tieup the went all the way out of the ring with both heavily starting each other down.  However from there, they didn't keep it going throughout the match as it was just a good average divas contest with Layla coming into play on the outside.  Instead of this coming off as a relevant match on the card with all the buildup it had, it just came off mostly as a filler but it was one of Mickie's better matches this year compared to the others where she just seemed to keep having an offnight.

Tables Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Sheamus - Unless you've been heavily paying attention to ECW & RAW for the past few months, your going to say ""Who The Hell Is Sheamus?""  Well, he's a new face in the heavyweight division known as the ""Celtic Warrior"" (complete with his own press in Irish newspapers) & was put in the right position for his first major PPV match against Cena in a tables match as it's been proven that Cena's best performances are in these types of ""No Rules"" matches.  They had a good brawl that had the usual moments you would expect but one key thing to pay attention to in this match is the commentary because eventhough people didn't like the ending, it was referenced early in the match and it was a good way to keep both men strong afterwards.

Chairs Match: World Champion Undertaker vs. Batista - Please someone correct me if I wrong but this is the first time I've ever heard of a ""chairs match"" but this is just a normal match with the stipulation that chairs were legal to use & that point was hammered home in the opening moments as Batista went for the chairs right away.  Eventhough chairs were legal, they didn't heavily base the match around that but I'll say that this match was a step down from their previous series of matches back in 2007-2008 as it just seemed like they didn't pick up the pase at all during the match and the ending was really just out of left field.  Good match but it didn't match the standards set by their previous matches as this was missing that ""it"" factor for me.

Kofi Kingston vs. Randy Orton - After months of having the ""rinse, wash, repeat"" formula of having Kofi defend his title in multiman matches before finally dropping the Jamacian character & getting more serious, this was Kofi's ""breakout"" match here as he was more aggressive than we've seen before with using high impact moves at various times before Orton hit a dropkick on Kofi's ribs in midair after Kofi jumped off the top rope onto the outside.  Orton continued his ""Viper"" character by heavily focusing on his ribs while Kofi kept fighting back.  Very competitve match between both men in a type of match that had both men leaving strong with great selling by Kofi throughout the match on both his ribs & his arm after blocking Orton's punt.

TLC Match: Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs. D-Generation X - DX was out to gain their first set of tag team championship (eventhough technically the New Age Outlaws were tag team champions as members of DX a decade ago).  This started out as you would expect with an all-out brawl on the from the ring to the floor all the way to the arm with dueling chair being used.  This match had it's various moments with Big Show actually being the M.V.P. of the match like how Triple H was sprawled across a ladder in the corner only for HBK to the thrown against him & be squished by Show, Big Show punched through a chair into Triple H's face, the power of Show destroying more than one ladder with his bare hands, and the comedic ending with Jericho & Show working together to grab the belts only for that to backfire in a nasty way for Jericho as he took the worst fall than anyone else the entire night.  If your expecting the heavy ""spotfest"" that you've gotten from TLC/Ladder matches in the past that you won't get it here but this was still a good contest with plenty of moments to not leave you disappointed.

Overall I have to say out of the three new ""themed"" PPV's WWE has done this year (submissions at Breaking Point, Hell In A Cell) that this was my favorite one as it wasn't a classic but come off like everyone stepped their game up & had a good mix of inring action (wrestling & hardcore) along with establishing new stars in the process so this is one PPV I would recommend checking.",1261872000,2,6136,4.463806970509383
4002101,5,B002VWNIF4,"Ladder ECW Championship Match: Christian (Champion) vs. Shelton Benjamin
They started the match out like a regular match, using some of their regular moves. When the fight spilled to the outside after Shelton hit the springboard forearm smash, they started using the security barricade. They ended up back in the ring, along with a ladder, but Christian sent Benjamin to the outside. Christian approached the ropes, holding the ladder, but Shelton grabbed his foot and tripped him, having the ladder fall on Christian's face and busting his eye open! On the outside, Benjamin set a ladder up like a bridge between the announce table and the ring. Shelton then flipped off the 20-foot ladder onto the recovering Christian on the outside!!! Benjamin then tried to suplex Christian on the ladder bridge, but Christian countered and tried to throw Benjamin into the ladder. Benjamin slid under the ladder though and dragged Christian under it. Benjamin tried for a slingshot, but Christian pushed him back and he ran into a ladder behind him! The fight went back into the ring, and Christian and Benjamin repeatedly tried to reach the title suspended above the ring, but they kept knocking the other off. Christian hit a Reverse DDT off the ladder and Benjamin hit an astonishing powerslam off the ladder! They used the ladder in some unique ways against one another, with Benjamin tipping the ladder over on purpose to hit an assisted clothesline on Christian on the way down! However, they both started to climb the ladder again, but Benjamin went for a sunset flip powerbomb off the ladder! Benjamin landed on his feet on accident though and Christian took advantage with a hurracanrana that sent Benjamin face-first into the second turnbuckle! They then started to battle on the apron where Benjamin tried to German suplex Christian through the ladder bridge! Christian battled out though and caught Benjamin with two boots to the face through the ropes! Benjamin landed on the ladder and Christian went to the top ropes! Christian hit a Frog Splash off the top and onto Benjamin, sending him THROUGH the ladder! Christina then climbed the ladder and retained his championship! Winner: Christian. Match Rating: 5/5

Intercontinental Championship Match: John Morrison (Champion) vs. Drew McIntyre
Morrison started the match on time with a slew of high-flying moves and strikes. Morrison caught McIntyre with a shoulder to the gut while on the apron and hit a springboard hurracanrna on McIntyre followed by a running knee to the back of Drew's head! The fight then spilled to the outside. Morrison hit a Chuck Kick off the apron and on the outside on McIntyre! Morrison charged McIntyre only to get tossed into the steel ring post when he tried for a hurracanrana. McIntyre then rolled Morrison back into the ring where he maintained the advantage with quick pins and some basic submission holds. Morrison was compromised like this for a while, but Morrison came back with a brilliant missile dropkick on McIntyre. McIntyre then hit a big time clothesline on Morrison and charged him in the corner, but Morrison moved out of the way and McIntyre's shoulder caught the steel ring post! Morrison then hit the Starship Pain on McIntyre, but his foot was under the bottom rope! Morrison kept the attack on McIntyre though with stiff kicks to the head. Morrison took off his belt and was about to use it as a weapon, but decided against it and tossed it to the mat. As the referee was taking care of the belt, Drew jabbed Morrison in the eyes! Drew then tried for the Double-Arm DDT, but Morrison tried to battle out. His efforts were futile, and Drew hit the move and PINNED Morrison to become the new Intercontinental Champion! Winner: Drew McIntyre. Match Rating: 5/5

Women's Championship Match: Michelle McCool (Champion) (with Layla) vs. Mickie James
Mark my words, Michelle McCool is going to go down as one of the best women wrestlers of all time. The match was a standard match at first, but James exploded with a ton of quick pins and some stiff shots. McCool fought back with her own type of slow, submission offense, but James powered out of her submissions. McCool slid Mickie into the steel ring post, and then the fight spilled to the outside. Layla almost accidentally got McCool disqualified by attacking James, but the referee stopped her. McCool tried for a running knee on James while her head was resting against the security barricade, but James moved out of the way. James then hit a freaking hurracanrana off the security barricade and on the outside on McCool! James brought the fight back into the ring, but when James tried going to the top ropes, Layla yanked on her leg! James jumped down to attack Layla, but McCool charged James with a big boot. James dodged it, it nailed Layla, and then James rolled up McCool. McCool kicked out though and caught James with a big boot to win the match. Winner: Michelle McCool. Match Rating: 4/5

Tables WWE Championship Match: John Cena (Champion) vs. Sheamus
Sheamus was dominated by John Cena at the beginning of the match, who hit a series of shoulderblocks and a big-time bulldog. Sheamus rolled to the outside to flee, but John Cena maintained the advantage by throwing Sheamus into the steel steps. Cena set a table up at ringside, but then Sheamus regained the advantage and rolled Cena back into the ring. Sheamus tried to knock Cena through the table set up on the outside but failed to do so. Cena tried to knock Sheamus through the table, but he too failed. Sheamus took Cena out with the Irish Curse, which is the name of the Bicycle Kick he uses, and then tried to suplex Cena on the ramp. Cena countered and suplexed Sheamus. Cena tried to smash Sheamus with a table while he was lying on the ramp, but Sheamus rolled out of the way and fled through the crowd. Cena followed in hot pursuit and then clotheslined Sheamus back to ringside. Cena set up a new table in the ring, but Sheamus regained the advantage after countering the Attitude Adjustment and tried to Spinebuster Sheamus through a table set up in the corner. Cena countered and hit a series of shoulderblocks and his spinning back suplex on Sheamus. Cena prepared to throw Cena through the table he had set up in the corner, but Sheamus wisely dumped it to the outside before Cena could do anything. Cena continued the attack and connected with the Five Knuckle Shuffle as well as the Attitude Adjustment! Cena set up yet another table in the ring and tried to hit a Super Attitude Adjustment on Sheamus through the table, but Sheamus powered out. Cena then tried for a superplex, but suddenly lost his balance and both Sheamus and Cena fell off the top! Cena fell through the table though and lost his title! Winner: Sheamus. Match Rating: 5/5

Chairs World Heavyweight Championship Match: The Undertaker (Champion) vs. Batista
At the beginning of the match Batista and Undertaker used chairs rather poorly. The battle spilled to the outside and Undertaker missed a knee in the security barricade. Batista smacked Undertaker in the back pretty weakly with a steel chair. In the ring, Batista set a chair up in the corner and tried to use it, but Undertaker countered. Undertaker then went on a roll, connecting with Snake Eyes and Old School, but Batista caught him with a surprise Spear! Undertaker kicked out, but Batista kept attacking him with the chair. Batista tried for the Batista Bomb on top of the chair, but Undertaker countered. Batista hit a Spinebuster, but Undertaker kicked out. Batista then hit a Spinebuster on Undertaker ON a steel chair, but Undertaker still kicked out. Batista tried for a Spear, but Undertaker moved and Batista hit his head on the steel chair in the corner. Undertaker connected with a Chokeslam and tried for the Tombstone, but Batista countered and pushed Batista into the referee. Batista then hit Undertaker in the sack and followed it up with a steel chair shot to pin Undertaker. Theodore Long came out though and ordered the match restarted because Batista broke the rules, which gave Undertaker the chance to hit Batista with some weak chair shots and connect with the Tombstone Piledriver to officially retain his title. Winner: The Undertaker. Match Rating: 4/5

Kofi Kingston vs. Randy Orton
Kingston took it to Orton early, hitting a series of high impact moves in quick succession. Orton tried to flee to the outside, but Kingston followed him. Kingston then ran up the steps and onto the top ropes, but when he tried to spin around and go for a flying crossbody, Orton met him with a high dropkick on the OUTSIDE right to the gut! Orton then started to dissect Kofi in the ring, with stomps and basic submissions. Orton then taunted Kofi and watched as he pulled himself up, but Kofi exploded with the S.O.S.! Orton kicked out, but Kofi then hit the Boom Drop, and prepared for the Trouble in Paradise, which connected! Orton grabbed the bottom rope at the last second to break the count, and then caught Kofi off-guard with a modified backbreaker. Orton then tried for the RKO, but Kofi countered with a backslide that nearly won him the match! Orton tried to retreat again, but Kofi hit him with a Suicide Dive! Kofi rolled Orton back into the ring, but as Kofi was getting into the ring, Orton nailed him with the second-story DDT! Orton then tried for the Concussion Punt, but Kofi blocked it with his arm! It still hurt Kofi's arm significantly though, and Orton realized it. Orton then hit an offensive move to focus on Kofi's arm, dodged a desperate Trouble in Paradise attempt, and then hit the RKO to pin Kofi! Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

TLC Unified WWE Tag Team Championships Match: Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and The Big Show) (Champions) vs. D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H)
Big Show and Triple H started brawling on the outside of the ring, with Triple H taking Big Show over the barricade with a clothesline and then setting a table up diagonally. In the ring, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels performed their usual moves. Jericho tried for the Walls of Jericho, but Michaels spun out of the move and hit a series of atomic drops and scoop slams. Michaels tried for the Flying Elbow Drop, but Jericho blocked it with his knees! Triple H and Big Show made their way to the top of the ramp. Triple H had the advantage by using a steel chair, but Jericho ran up and attacked him in the back with a chair of his own. Triple H attacked and tried for the Pedigree, but Jericho countered and back body dropped Triple H on the steel ramp. Michaels then ran to make the save. He disappeared into the backstage area and returned with a steel chair! Michaels and Jericho had a fight with the chairs with Michaels coming out on top. Michaels then dragged Jericho back to ringside where they battled some more, but Jericho regained the advantage here and set up a table. Jericho and Michaels kept trying to put each other through the table, but failed. Both teams then tried to use ladders to reach the belts, but they kept knocking it down and taking people off the ladders in unique ways. Big Show got whacked right in the back of the head with the ladder and DX worked in tandem to essentially suplex a ladder right onto Jericho's back. Shawn tried for the Sweet Chin Music on Jericho, but Jericho ducked the attack and hit the Codebreaker. Triple H caught Jericho with the Pedigree, but turned around to a Spear! Big Show tried to climb the ladder, but he ate a chair to the back from Triple H. Big Show responded with a Knockout Punch into the face of Triple H! Shawn and Jericho started climbing a ladder, but Jericho jumped down and tipped it over, which inadvertently sent Shawn into a flying crossbody to the outside on Big Show. Big Show and Jericho then had the clear advantage over DX, using the ladder to smash them in between it. Big Show then RIPPED a ladder in half! Big Show took Triple H and Shawn Michaels to the outside where Big Show Chokeslammed Shawn onto Triple H and through the table Triple H set up earlier! Jericho tried to climb the broken ladder, but failed obviously. Jericho then instructed Show to let him stand on his shoulders to try to grab the belts. DX recovered though and Big Show was defenseless as a result! Shawn caught Big Show with a Sweet Chin Music, which made him dump Jericho to the outside and smack his face on the table he set up earlier! Shawn hit Big Show with ANOTHER Sweet Chin Music, followed by a Pedigree from Triple H! Shawn and Triple H then used the broken ladder to clothesline Big Show to the outside, and then Triple H held up the half of a ladder so Shawn could climb it and pull down the belts! Winners: D-Generation X. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Awesome, awesome show. Everyone gave great performances. All of the matches were very entertaining and there was a lot of twists and shockers sprinkled throughout the entire program. A couple of the matches were weaker than they should have been, and the concept of a ""Chairs"" match is pretty lame, but overall the show was PHENOMENAL. Probably the best wrestling pay-per-view of the entirety of 2009. Sheamus is the WWE Champion. Yeah, no joke. There were hardly any promos to speak of though, and that was a bit of a letdown.",1261440000,,13265,4.720017256255392
4002102,3,B002VWNIF4,"I'm gonna sound like a jackass on this one, so here goes.

WWE's ""TLC"" PPV is likely going to be a favorite from 2009.  Sadly, it isn't one of mine.  I say this because I like to read other people's reactions before I write my own reviews, just so that I can better understand (or criticize) what I've watched.

""TLC: Tables, Ladders, & Chairs"" has received a positive response from the websites I like to visit.  As for me, I enjoyed the event for the most part, but I'd be dishonest if I gave it a whole-hearted recommendation.

Please excuse me if I get defensive while I type this:

1) Ladder Match - ECW Championship
Shelton Benjamin v. Christian (champion)
---These two literally claimed on TV that they were going to steal the show.  Well, judging by the crowd, they didn't even come close.  The pace didn't keep up, with high spots being telegraphed.  You could see these guys talking way too much!  My favorite Ladder Matches feel natural, and flow at a smooth pace.  But this one barely sustained any momentum; they even stopped the match because Christian cut himself!  To be fair, most Ladder Matches end on a weak note, whereas the best spot of this match was the final one.  Overall, I commend these two guys for their risky moves, but Christian & Shelton Benjamin are capable of so much more than this.  The Tuesday night show has been in trouble for quite some time, and I'm afraid this wasn't enough to give the SyFy program a much-needed boost.
""6.0 / 10""

2) Intercontinental Championship
Drew McIntyre v. John Morrison (champion)
---I lost interest in McIntyre after his initial push a few years ago suddenly stopped.  A friend of mine promised, ""He's gonna impress you.  Give him time.""  Boy, it feels good to be wrong.  These guys worked quite well together.  Morrison has successfully found how his character can be both a cocky villain or a confident good guy.  And McIntyre is capable of bright future.  This match was somewhat traditional, as Drew keeps the upper hand, only to have Morrison come back with a flurry of hot offense.  But the two wrestlers kept putting neat touches on their contest.  Drew has a smerk that makes you love to hate him.  Most newcomers oversell their beatings or overdominate their opponents.  But McIntyre has just the right balance; it's fun to see him get hurt, and interesting to see him control the match.  Morrison's risky athleticism was crisp for the most part too.  The finish was a tad weak, but it didn't bother me as much as it could've.  This isn't a Match-of-the-Year candidate, but it's a promising sign of things to come.
""7.0 / 10""

3) Women's Championship
Mickie James v. Michelle McCool (champion - w/ Layla)
---""RAW"" may bring the ratings, but ""SmackDown"" has go the ladies.  Matt Striker might've been premature when he guaranteed that McCool would be in the Hall of Fame, but his praise is well-founded.  Michelle McCool is my favorite Diva in quite some time, ever since Mickie James' successful run back in 2006.  How ironic, right?  These two had a decent match together, better than most of Mickie James' outings this year.  Even Layla's role in the match was pretty well done, making this probably her best stuff to date (strange compliment, I know).  Like most women's matches this year, the crowd wasn't into it.  They were so dead that they didn't react to a super-obvious botch, followed by a very vicious by Michelle.  I guess this one worked well enough, but I expected more from these two ladies.
""6.0 / 10""

4) Tables Match - WWE Championship
Sheamus v. John Cena (champion)
---Well...THAT was a surprise.  Drew McIntyre and Sheamus have received criticism for their pushes.  I can buy McIntyre as a future talent; Sheamus' character really bores me.  However, his physical presence is all you really need in a match like this.  To my delight, Cena & Sheamus pulled it off very well.  The two of them had a very exciting slugfest.  Their brawl in the crowd was more fun than audience brawls usually are.  The Tables weren't used much, but I kinda liked the minial usage.  The final spot is what brings my score down a bit.  It took too darn long to set up, and if it weren't for Jerry Lawler's second-guessing of the decision, I'd have thought it was done wrong.  I'm still not buying Sheamus as the WWE champion.  But as a physical performer, I'll spend my money to watch a few more scuffles with Cena.
""7.5 / 10""

5) Chairs Match - World Heavyweight Championship
Batista v. The Undertaker (champion)
---The new evil Batista works, and WWE is wise to let him run with this direction.  And even though I believe Taker's days are numbered, he's still a fighting champion.  The Chairs weren't used all that much, but to expect a huge Chair-fest was kinda silly anyway.  We wanted to see Taker & Batista mix it up just like they did in 2007, right?......or did we?  Frankly, as decent as this showdown was, there was very little that was unique about it.  I've seen these spots & exchanges too many times between these men; it wasn't supposed to be a throwback.  And the finish was stupid.  STUPID STUPID STUPID.  There was no logical reason for Teddy Long to restart the match, other than the kids in the audience were still crushed that their hero Cena had lost his spinner belt.
""6.5 / 10""
_______________________________________

6) Randy Orton v. Kofi Kingston
---I believe this was the true test of whether Kingston was going to be main event material.  I also believe, sadly, that we're gonna have to wait a bit longer for him to get there.  This straight-up one-on-one affair did little for either man, except maybe that Orton got a clean pinfall victory.  Kofi just didn't get enough chances to explode with his unique offense.  And Orton's slow pace works, as long as you are invested in the hero's struggle to come back.  But this contest didn't flow very well.  Like the ECW Title Ladder Match, it had its moments, but not a compelling story or progression.  Kofi Kingston will one day be one of WWE's biggest stars, but tonight won't do much to convince the skeptics.
""6.5 / 10""

7) TLC Match - Unified Tag Team Championships
D-Generation X v. Chris Jericho & Big Show (champions)
---While Jeri-Show & DX put on a good main event, this one didn't really get as crazy as it should've.  I don't expect the Attiude-Era spotfests, but these four guys didn't use the TLC stipulations enough.  I suppose that's because to these veterans, ""Less Is More"".  In that sense, the match worked.  There were no crazy falls from the Ladders, but there was enough suspense every time someone started to climb them.  The Chairs didn't bust anybody open, but there were some unique moments, like when HBK and Y2J had a duel.  And the Tables......well, one spot was weaksauce, and the final one was worse on Jericho's body then it should've because it was botched.  I wish we got to see something more than an entertaining brawl between these two teams, and got to see more of a TLC Match.  But as it is, DX & Jeri-Show brought the PPV to a satisfying close.
""7.0 / 10""

""TLC: Tables, Ladders, & Chairs"" does not have a single bad match on its card.  But it doesn't have any great matches, either.  It's just a 3-hour presentation of watchable content that rarely got my hardcore fan juices flowing.  I guess I thought all 7 of these matches could've been special, and none them came even close.  Plus, I think people hoping to see some good TLC action are gonna be disappointed.

By all means give this one a watch.  But I think I'd be disappoint even if I only paid DVD dollars.  Imagine how a PPV purchase must've felt.",1260748800,2,7844,4.765230312035661

8382616,5,B002VWNIF4,"I saw this PPV on the WWE Network a few months ago. It's cool for two matches that got fans talking back then, the Tables match for the WWE Championship and the Main Event TLC match for the Unified Tag Team Titles.

Sheamus came to RAW during October 2009, and then throughout the 6 weeks or so, unleashed brutality from ending Jamie Noble's wrestling career to a crushing spear on Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks through a table leading up to this PPV.

The Tables match for the WWE Championship is where John Cena took on Sheamus and lost. The reception to this title match left fans stunned in silence. Now that's how WWE builds young stars although some might disagree with my opinion.

If I have to talk about Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin for the ECW Championship again, then all I gotta say that its an acceptable opener.
The Undertaker vs. Batista in a Chairs match was decent though.

The main event on the other hand, was cool and imaginary because HHH & HBK of D-Generation X were so smart to beat Chris Jericho and Big Show (Team Jerishow) in a TLC match in the most creative way to win the Tag Team titles.",1468540800,,1123,4.436893203883495
