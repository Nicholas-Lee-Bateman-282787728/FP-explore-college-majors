8070803,2,B0009ZE9RQ,"The biggest problem with this series is that one of the students sexually harresses the teacher, and that she does this because the teacher looks like a little girl, and she likes little girls.

Another problem is that the girl doesn't get punished for this behavior.  She ought to get expelled, or atleast suspended from school.  The teacher doesn't tell her to stop as a teacher.  She does however says stuff like, ""No stop"" and she cries sometimes.  It often seems like this teacher doesn't just look like a kid- she acts like one.

Now, I knew from the description that there was a girl with a crush on her teacher- and that could have been interesting if she didn't torment the teacher and if the teacher didn't look like a child.

This show did have potential to be a good show- there are some interesting characters in it and parts of it is very funny.  There is this guy who cross-dresses, the guy that like this other guy- who doesn't even realize it, the girl that wants to make money to buy stuff, etc.

Perhaps, if the show were edited some, it could be fixed.",1148083200,2,1072,4.428571428571429
8070804,2,B0009ZE9RQ,"I hate to say this but this anime didn't catch my eye, and I didn't  catch the comedy of it either.

The story line is paper thin and you get the feeling as you watch each character introduce themself as if this is the second season of a long running show, that didn't sit well with me. I like some sort of beginning point: I'd stick to anime shows like; Fruits Basket, Midori Days, Chobits, Sister Princess and in August release of Negima: CAN'T WAIT!

But who knows I stopped watching at the middle of episode two and put it in my discarded files of anime.",1147910400,,558,4.245283018867925

8070806,3,B0009ZE9RQ,"Doki Doki School hours is the latest school anime comedy to arrive stateside. Comparisons to Azumanga Daioh will no doubt abound given that both are based in school and the students unique personalities are central to plot.

In Doki Doki the main character is Mika sensei, a young, short and incredibly cute teacher who finds her classroom students to be more in control of class than she is. The show boasts a large cast of students each with their own personalities. There is the nerd, the cute girl, the old guy guy, athlete, gay guy, shopaholic girl etc, etc. The show is fast paced and the jokes revolve around the students personalities.

in teh first few episodes we meet MIka sensei and her students. We learn Mika still lives with her parents. Her mother is a rather pushy mom telling her whats besta nd her father is a totally nice guy always helping Mika out.

Doki Doki is a cute show but after you get to know the students and the situations the comedy gets a bit tired and the jokes predictable. Still the show is a fun watch and is totally harmless fluff. If you are  fan of light-hearted comedy then this may be just the thing.",1139270400,3,1143,4.480769230769231
8070807,5,B0009ZE9RQ,"What do you get when you take an 8th grade student and force her to teach high school? Yelled at. Possibly fired. Who knows? people will do anything these days.

Mika Suzuki, our heroine, is 4'6"" and has an almost impossibly young figure...which is to say, none at all. She looks about twelve. In actuality, she's a 27-year-old teacher at suburban high school in Japan, and her own students look older than she does! How will she get them to take her seriously? She has few friends outside of school, no energy, no stamina, frequent panic attacks, bouts of daydreaming and on top of that, she still lives with her parents!

Doki Doki School Hours follows the lives of Miss Suzuki and her overbearing students over the course of a year of school. Volume 1 (a.k.a. the First Hour) sets the stage and introduces Suzuki-san and the rest of the cast, including, but not limited to: the self-obsessed metrosexual boy; the dominating preppy girl who enjoys making Suzuki-san suffer; and the artistically inclined nerd that upsets Suzuki-san if he doesn't finish the comics he draws on the back of his tests.

The whole concept is just plain fun, and the shows themselves go down easy. Not just ""hot soup"" easy, either. we're talking ""milk"" easy. They're light and fluffy and delicious. I recommend Doki Doki School Hours very highly.

When I read a review for this title, the first thing that I thought of was Azumanga Daioh, an immensely popular sort of romp through high school seen through the eyes of several slightly psychotic female students. As it turns out, the original Doki Doki manga predates the Azumanga Daioh manga by more than two years.",1133827200,6,1645,4.76140350877193
8070808,5,B0009ZE9RQ,"It seems to me that Amazon needs to get a new anime reviewer. The current reviewer does not seem to like, nor understand anime.

I personally love the series Doki Doki School Hours, or as I was intruduced to it as Sensei no Ojikan. It's relatively violence-free, which is rare, and it's open and friendly entertainment.",1130198400,8,319,4.696428571428571
8070809,5,B0009ZE9RQ,"You've got love, friendship, weirdo's all mixed up in one classroom, with a teacher whom is 27 and doesn't look older then 10 years. It's hard to say what it is about, because there are there are so many different episodes. My favorite character is Seki. He's a guy who loves acting as a girl! There is a guy also known as old man and a girl whom is very dedicated to much actually to her childlike teacher. This was very fun to watch.",1130198400,6,435,4.190476190476191
