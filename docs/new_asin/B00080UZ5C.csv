8219839,5,B00080UZ5C,"It is a mark of the times that DGG has deleted this item; I have no doubt that it would not rate as one of the best sellers but attitudes of record executives are not what they were when David Sarnoff, et.al., were running the business. They loved classical music and knew that unlike pop music it would take a long time to recoup the costs involved, but they firmly believed that recoup them they would. Why has the hugh quantity of Caruso discs remained in the catalogue for so many years? There are a few DVD's of DFD available, but this one is unique in that it includes his operatic roles. Alas they they teasers, notably the Frosch and Arabella, but the quality of the black and white films is very good. They should be released.

Of course it was as a lieder artist that DFD was primarily known and the second disc is devoted to this art, and own it he did with Schwarzkopf. They defined the art in a way that has never been duplicated since although in Europe the liederabend is more healthy than in the US. WE are the loosers but we do have the CD's and a few DVD's and when Amazon has sold the last of this wonderful set finding a copy will doubtless be very difficult.

I can only urge those who esteem the great baritone's art to not let this set slip away from you. There aren't many left.",1242950400,,1302,4.245967741935484

8219841,5,B00080UZ5C,"The video and sound quality of ""The Art of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau"" is not state of the art, but there is much to enjoy here.  In Disc 1, about opera, there are excerpts from DFD's role as the Count in Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"", from Jean Pierre Ponelle's 1976 film; footage of live performances of Richard Strauss's ""Arabella"" and ""Die Frau ohne Schatten"", both conducted by Joseph Keilberth; a Ferenc Fricsay led ""Don Giovanni"" (Berlin, 1961); and Aribert Reimann's 1980 atonal opera ""Lear"" (Munich, 1982).  The sound in all but the Mozart Figaro and Reimann Lear is mono, but always pretty good, and not distorted in climaxes.  Only those expecting top quality sound will be disappointed.  DFD's 2005 interview, in German, but with English subtitles is very interesting, and enlightening.  I am thankful DFD appears healthy, and he is still handsome at age 80.

Disc 2, devoted to lieder, is also interesting.  Wolfgang Sawallisch as pianist makes a terrific accompanist in various songs of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Wolf, and Richard Strauss.  The video quality of the 1974 Berlin TV film is not the best, and may disappoint some, but the sound is quite good.  I enjoyed this DVD, but I love lieder and will overlook poor video more than poor audio!  The Mahler Kindertotenlieder with Lorin Maazel (cond.) is also fine, but I didn't find this as interesting as the Sawallisch accompanied lieder.  There is another 2005 interview with DFD, in German with English subtitles, which I found fascinating, too.

I hope these DVDs sell well, and that DG will release more DFD material they may have in their vaults.  I hope they can do  similar DVDs of Hermann Prey (1929-1998), Fritz Wunderlich (1930-1966) and Karl Bohm (1894-1981) if there is enough filmed material (preferably in good audio) of them to do similar overviews.  In short, I enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone who likes opera and Lieder of the Romantic and 20th century eras.",1137542400,11,1964,4.963302752293578
8219842,5,B00080UZ5C,"I just had to say something to defend this 2DVD set from the previous review.  Perhaps the sound isn't 5.1 Digital remastered whatever - but what a treat to see Dietrich Fischer Dieskau in some very rare footage.  He rarely made video recordings, especially of lieder, so to have a whole program of Schubert, Strauss, Schumann and Beethoven, plus the complete Mahler Kindertotenlieder with a very young Loren Maazel conducting - and a whole disc of opera excerpts from Nozze di Figaro, Giovanni, Il tabarro, Die Frau Ohne Schatten, Arabella, and Lear -- what a treasure trove of incredible footage!

To top it off, there is a 10-15 minute interview with DF-D at the end of each DVD, a fascinating look at the incredible man who brought lieder to a whole new level and reintroduced it (and Mahler's music) to the world.

This is to be snapped up immediately by DF-D fans, and by serious students of voice.",1128729600,18,904,4.7025316455696204
8219843,1,B00080UZ5C,I'm a big fan of Dieskau. This DVDs have poor sound quality and very boring pictures. I totally wasted my money!,1126483200,2,112,4.380952380952381
