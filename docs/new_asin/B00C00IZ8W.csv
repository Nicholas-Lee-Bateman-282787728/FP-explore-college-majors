8576018,5,B00C00IZ8W,This is a gem of a film. I have always thought that one of the best ways to understand a culture is through dance and music and these producers really went the extra mile to lovingly document Cuban salsa in a way that makes me feel that I have really gotten to know a little something of this culture through the people and images. I am recommending it to people I know who can appreciate the love that went into this. Thank you,1430092800,,428,4.168674698795181

Wow- this film has something for everyone.  I was mesmerized by the photography, the in-depth and patient filming- really allowing the dancers to tell their stories- and the emotional connection that draws the viewers into the film.  Really, if you like travel, or like to dance, or just like great documentaries, this film should be on your must-watch list.",1373155200,2,446,5.095890410958904
8576020,5,B00C00IZ8W,"A note from the producers: La Salsa Cubana is a Spanish language film with English subtitles. The subtitles are hard-coded and sit a bit low on the screen because they were formatted for cinema. This usually isn't a problem, but we've heard of cases where a DVD player and/or TV will crop the film at the bottom, and in some cases this can crop off the subtitles. Try changing your DVD player settings to ""letterbox"" to show the full 16X9 image and prevent cropping. If all else fails, you can play the DVD on your computer. Not ideal, but it works!",1367712000,4,549,4.445544554455446

We saw the film in San Francisco at the 5th Salsa Rueda Festival and then again in Santa Cruz, California in March 2013. We studied dance in Cuba and we experienced how the people live there. So, we can say that we can relate.
We were very much impressed about this film. The film captures you in many ways. The film shows the true life and dreams of the people. The story line was great introducing the people with interviews, leading to the competition and at the end showing what is happening after the climax. Not the typical Hollywood ending but real life, inspiring and truthful! We loved the interviews, the cinematography. Impressive photography from different angels during the Rueda dances. Great selection of music. This is not Hollywood but a great and true independent film! A must see!",1365897600,4,882,4.809210526315789
