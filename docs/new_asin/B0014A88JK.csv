8254789,3,B0014A88JK,"The audio is terrible,the video quality is worse. This was made a long time ago should have updated the video to modern standards. The detail of carving is on track but that's about all. Would not recommend unless you know that it's low quality audio and video if you can live with that.",1506556800,,287,4.433962264150943

8254792,5,B0014A88JK,"First, this is a great video and gets 5 stars from me. This video is targeting beginning carvers but I can see it being just as useful to an intermediate carver. Her technique is solid and her tips will improve anyone's first attempt at creating a wood spirit. I learned a lot.",1330128000,,277,4.346153846153846
8254793,4,B0014A88JK,"Betty Robertson is a skilled wood carver and clearly knows what she is doing. However, this does not translate well on to the DVD as it is hampered by poor quality of the video, camera work, and audio.

The video covers tools and techniques and a full demo of carving a Wood Spirit. It was a good introduction, but did not come away with the feeling I could complete a carving on my own.

This was a very interesting instructional video with marginal production quality but good content.",1216339200,8,487,4.5227272727272725
