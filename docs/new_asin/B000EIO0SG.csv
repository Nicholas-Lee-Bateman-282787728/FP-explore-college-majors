SARKAR is his homage to the Mario Puzo/Francis Ford Coppola classic and is itself a taut crime melodrama but centering on the true power of Mumbai, Subhash Nagare, who is dubbed Sarkar by the general populace. ""Sarkar"" translates to ""The Government"" and is also an honorific used when speaking to someone of great authority. As played by the magnetic Amitabh Bachchan, Subhash Nagare is regal in presence and not one to be trifled with.

So, in Mumbai, everyone bows to Sarkar. Even the local ruling government respects and even fears Sarkar's far reaching influence. Each day sees the downtrodden people of Mumbai frequenting his abode and patiently lining up for hours to air their grievances to Subhash Nagare. Subhash is considered a ""parallel government,"" as one character in the film puts it, and he's able and willing to dispense justice when all other channels have proven ineffective.

But Subhash Nagare is largely misunderstood by the governing establishment. He is labeled an underworld don; Nagare considers himself a man of the people, a man with a vision, who doesn't shirk from what needs to be done, even if that should be an eye for a bloody eye. No, he's not a gangster but rather a charismatic man who wields extraordinary clout and unchecked power. But a man with such sovereignty always inspires jealousy. It was only a matter of time before hidden forces conspire to frame Sarkar in the assassination of a popular politician, who had condemned him as a thug. With his friends and allies turning on him and with his freedom and very life threatened, Subhash Nagare turns to one person: his son Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan). But will the thoughtful and idealistic Shankar be able to muster the drive and ruthlessness necessary to do what must be done?

Some damn fine acting in this one. Amitabh is his usual excellent self, bringing the gravitas to his role like no one else can. Meanwhile, for the first half of the film, Abhishek just seems to linger in the scenes, being the faithful, goody-two-shoes son. But he reaches his stride in the second half as he then turns in a performance matching his father in concentrated intensity and brooding angst. Abhishek, not surprisingly, won film awards as Best Supporting Actor for his role of Shankar. A pat on the back also goes to Kay Kay Menon who plays the other son, the vicious and tortured Vishnu. I don't know the actor who played the evil, scheming swami (could he brush his hair aside more?), but he, too, is very effective - I hated him on sight. Tanisha has some good wistful scenes as Shankar's childhood friend. Katrina Kaif is okay as Pooja, Shankar's girlfriend who forces him to choose between her and his father. Katrina Kaif, by the way, is very hot.

Is SARKAR as good as THE GODFATHER? Well, let's not kid ourselves. As mentioned, SARKAR is this director's homage to Coppola's epic film and only superficially resembles the 1972 classic. In its own right, SARKAR is a compelling motion picture with riveting acting performances by the superstar father and son tandem. Then, there's the powerhouse score and that ever recurring song ""Govinda Govinda"" which greatly enhances the tension level. But SARKAR is no GODFATHER.

In its style and ferocity, SARKAR's probably as far from a typical Bollywood film as one can get, especially since it makes do without any musical dance productions and, at 2 hours in length, is far shorter than the Bollywood norm. If certain narrative points were tame and derivative, well, there were still enough highlight moments to make up for them, including the last 15 minutes or so, when Shankar comes into his own and gets his dark revenge on (although I did feel that certain sequences there were too rushed). I also really liked the final scene. Yes, you could see it coming a mile away - the movie, after all, had been leading up to this moment - but it still ends up as the most fitting way on which to cap things.

Incidentally, SARKAR proved to be enough of a box office hit in 2005 that a sequel, SARKAR 2, is in the works and is scheduled for theatrical release in early 2008. This sequel is slated to co-star my favorite Bollywood actress, Abhishek's newlywed wife Aishwarya Rai (now Aishwarya Bachchan). Director Ram Gopal Varma has stated that SARKAR 2 won't be patterned after GODFATHER 2 but will instead tell its own different story. I can't wait to check it out!",1181347200,,4833,5.142493638676845

2521563,5,B000EIO0SG,"Sarkar (means government) is inspired by GodFather. Treatment and style of the film is quite better than GodFather.

This story has few similarities to existing culture of politics in bombay (Financial captial of India). Amithbahan (Lead role) played as Sarkar who runs the parallel goverment in bombay. Black market drug dealer trys to get help of Sarkar to run his business. Not only fails to get his support, Sarkar warns him that he does not encourage such business at all and does not keep quite if somebody does it.  The conflict leads to assisination atempt on Sarkar and his power.

Film does not have any songs like other India movies.

Ramgopal Varma is the highly respected director of India. Who has good talent to become a holywood director.

Latest news is that, he is going to make hollywood film in 2009.",1180656000,,820,4.787234042553192

8110482,5,B000EIO0SG,"""Sarker"" is the creation of a life time from Ramu, it will remain as a highlight in all the artists careers, a great movie...it sucks you into it and throws you out. I watched the movie and before i could realize it started...it finished. When someone says slow narration...they are just ignorant of what cinema making is all about. Amitabh is excellent...on par with him is his real life son Abhishek, who plays Shankar the son of Subhash in the movie. He is the one actor out of the young genre who will stand tall for a long time. The music of the movie is first rate, it plays a very important role in keeping us glued to what happens on screen.

I read a post saying ""a bad adaptation of Godfather"" lets get this one clear that this is not Godfather. We get that impression because Ramu says he is inspired by the Hollywood movie, very kind of him. I have seen the movie and can confirm that approx 5% meets with what we have seen in Godfather.

Talking about direction, I could write a couple of pages about it, but i prefer to say it is exceptional. Its a pity these movies do not get as much exposure as international cinema, but having watched movies from all other languages, Indian cinema will continue to raise the bar when the Bollywood leadership continues to support and encourage it's unorthodox directors such as Ramu. Through it's actions it not only guaranties the quality of cinema now it is also encouraging up and coming directors to continue to produce even better quality of film to us in the future..

It's time to watch the movie or you will miss out on something special.",1364601600,2,1598,4.465753424657534
8110483,5,B000EIO0SG,"You are cordially invited to an inside view of  Subhash Nagres cozy living room where gently dappled light from the sun shining through the trees floats across your face. People from outside his sphere wait to meet with him while he has his morning tea. You are but one of the people that day who will sit and speak very quietly because this is where the power of Maharashtra is and you don't want it to spill over on to you. On the good side you can tell when something is about to get said or done because just like the eye of a storm it gets very quiet. The people stop talking, Sarkar speaks... and things happen. This is the average breakfast of Sarkar (played by Amitabh Bachchan better known as Big B ) the head of this organization. You bring him a problem and he will consider helping you if he deems it fit. Maybe it's a matter of your daughters honor, she was sexually assaulted and after trying to get justice in court she commits suicide because they made her life a living hell. You want and need satisfaction for this heinous deed before you die old and alone now, because she can't rest in peace till the rapist is punished. And he will be most thoroughly punished .

Sarkars world is full of checks and balances based on his honor . Someone wants to do business that's not good for the future of his people but will make Sarkars allies tons of money ...he will refuse to do it; and refuse to let them do it. They need his permission to do business in his territory. Sarkar isn't interested in lining his pockets excessively, he alone will make sure his supporters are looked after even if it cost him. This includes his own children . Eating dinner with the family becomes an ordeal for his rebellious son Vishnu (Kay Kay Megnon), and a fight starts over an overt action that bypassed his father.  Vishnu just will not learn . Foul language , extreme temper and worst of all shortsightedness based on his own pleasure principle . A veritable Id child. These things Sarker can no longer abide in his sons actions. Vishnu is a weak link and a loose canon;  a possible weapon in his enemies hands. His other son is Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan , Bachchans real life son). He's back from America to meet with his father and to introduce him not only to some business investments but to a girl he wishes to marry(Katrina Kaif) despite being promised to a girl being raised in Sarkars house . Sarkar is lenient with this son  and listens to both proposals. This son is respectful and causes him no shame in his life. He will be opened minded with him and intervene on his behalf if he can. This is a day in the life of Sarkar. It will be a very pivotal day for him.

 While the director lets the quiet moments settle in he also has a passion for background music but then so did the Godfather series. This is the only flaw to me in either Sarkar or Sarkar Raj. Both are well written and have enough excitement of action and devious intent to keep a viewer riveted despite the irritation.  I later read more reviews on the pleasant but repetitive music and that did seem to be the consensus on that point. I've set through it over and over so it definitely wasn't that bad.

 I sat through Sarkar as well as Sarkar Raj back to back. I was compelled by a need I couldn't control. You know there is going to be pain ahead for Sarkar but you just have to keep watching. I have the calluses on my butt to prove it. That in and of itself is a testament to how good these guys are at their jobs because trust me when I say I ain't the patient sort . Still it's worth sitting through both of these films Sarkar and Sarkar Raj..not only are they good but they will be quoted in the future in a lot of livingrooms. So definitely watch them.....Just not for the love of GOVINDA back to back . You'll see what I mean about that statement while watching Sarkar Raj. I dare you to wait a day in between. I was most unsuccessful on that attempt at restraint. I would make a horrible Godfather. This director made a Damn fine one.",1336608000,5,4023,4.302509907529722
8110484,1,B000EIO0SG,"What a yawnfest! This movie was as boring as The Godfather was fascinating. The acting and music were good. The direction, the pacing, the action, etc were off-the mark. The director claims to have been inspired by The Godfather but  lame rip offs of some of the plot is hardly inspiration.

The Godfather is a classic for so many reasons. Among them, the conceits, the catch-phrases, and the brutal violence. Sarkar lacks all of them. The violence is not convincing. The actors may as well have got up and walked off after they were shot dead.

What a waste of time, talent and film.",1260489600,,584,4.596153846153846
8110485,5,B000EIO0SG,"Amitabh Bachchan rivals Marlon Brando as the iconic criminal patriarch in this fascinating retelling of the American classic 'The Godfather.' Instead of stroking a cat in his lap as Brando famously did, Bachchan 'is' the cat--cool and regal and ferocious--sipping from a bowl in one key scene like a sleek panther waiting to pounce. In the Indian version of the story, there are two brothers instead of three. The oldest, Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), is a fusion of Sonny and Fredo, and the character is far more complex than either of the elder Corleone sons. The youngest, Shankar (played by Amitabh's son Abhishek Bachchan), is Michael--a perfect role for the junior Bachchan, who excels at strong, silent, and sinister. The director, Ram Gopal Varma, tips his hat to Francis Ford Coppola by shooting the film like a chiaroscuro painting in an Italian Catholic church. But here the religious piety juxtaposed with the violence is Hindu--Sarkar the murderous mob boss clutches prayer beads and sports a red tikka smeared on his forehead. The film follows the same basic plot as the original, but there are many key twists that make this version compellingly unique. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1255392000,,1397,5.688995215311005
8110486,4,B000EIO0SG,"A very entertaining film.  One can see connections in the plot line to The Godfather, but never to the point of feeling that one is watching a clone.  The Indian context of the film is a great strength;  another is the high contrast of the imagery.  Lots of empty dark negative space which concentrate the focus of the watcher on the important elements in the scene.  The great brooding building in which the Nagres live; the numbers of people there going about their daily routines while all of this drama is taking place and the eerie sound track all contribute to the ominous feeling of the film.  The supporting cast is terrific.  Often one forgets that one is watching actors, the performances are so naturally nuanced.  All of the villains are super; the evil swami, the indulgent, tortured elder brother, the drug kingpin, and the smiling southerner.  Women play minor roles in the story, but the performances are fine, particularly ""Mama"" Nagre. Abishek is good, but brooding glaring angst doesn't really cut it for me.  Amitabh is fantastic. So much is implied with a minimum of gesture. Terrific use of that deep rumbly voice of authority.  Is this film as good as The Godfather?  No.  Mario Puzo""s novel and script are world class, this screenplay is good, but not in the same league.  All in all, a film I am happy to own, and will watch again.",1253404800,,1356,4.666666666666667
