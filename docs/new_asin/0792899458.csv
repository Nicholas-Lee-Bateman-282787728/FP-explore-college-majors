156096,5,0792899458,This movie is that kind that you watch one time and want to watch more and more. It's very good.,988848000,,96,3.85
156097,4,0792899458,"As Myra Gale Lewis herself said, this story is ""true as far as it goes,"" but does not tell the whole story. It covers the main events of Jerry Lee Lewis' life from his meeting of Myra and geting a contract with Sun Records to the birth of his son Steve Allen Lewis during the midst of his blacklisting. It leaves out a lot of the more unsavory and darker details of the lives and characters of hese two young lovers.
That having been said, it's a fun romp that follows the typical Hollywood rock & roll musical bio-pic formula: young man has a new sound, while performing someone says ""we can't play that music here, these people will kill us!"" He does anyway and it becomes a big hit, then scandal strikes and his career takes a tumble. There are the typical scenes of performing, watching the music charts, montages of Jerry Lee's career, screaming fans, and so forth. Several legendary incidents are receated, such as burning the piano when he has to perform before Chuck Bery and Elvis showing up at the Sun studios as he leaves for the army. This is all done at a breakneck pace, with humor and fun. Music from the period is used liberally throughout the film, adding to the mood and the humor.
Through all this is the impression the Jerry Lee is desparate for attention. He lives for the spotlight and being noticed. He is truly happy when people are going crazy over him, and gets very upset if he is not accepted as he is.
The question of the morality of a 23-year-old, twice married but only once divorced man marrying his 13-year-old 2nd cousin is not truly answered. Though it does cause the big scandal, the characters are played as so naive and in love, one can sympathize with them even as certain people may recoil.
There is a running sub-plot of Jerry Lee's relationship with his preacher cousin Jimmie Lee Swaggart. Jimmie's career as a preacher keeps him in conflict with Jerry Lee's life of rock & roll and brings out some very amusing exchanges. These really help define Jerry Lee's character. Some great lines include: ""Don't thank God, just thank old Jerry Lee Lewis!""; ""I am of the opinion thas such a God-given talent should be used for the glory of the talented.""; ""If I'm going to Hell, I'm goin' to Hell playin' the piano!"" Jerry Lee may fear god, but he fears being ordinary and forgotten even more.
Dennis Quaid is a total hoot as an immature doofus with a ""God given talent."" Winnona Ryder makes a very convincing 13-year-old discovering love for the first time and torn between having fun and growing up (later on certain people debated whose idea it was to have Jerry Lee played as less mature than Myra). John Doe, a singer-sonwriter himself, gives a great performance worthy of a funky underground cult film as Jerry Lee's cousin/band mate/father-in-law. Trey Wilson and Stephen Tobolowsky play off well angainst each other as the Phillips brothers of Sun Records. Watch for cameos by Mojo Nixon, Steve Allen, Jimmie Vaughn, Joe Bob Briggs, Michael St. Gerard (as the most accurate young Elvis ever!), and Dave Alvin (uncredited as a guitarist in the band at the closing number).
Inaccuracies abound here. There is an extra member in Jerry Lee's band. The song ""I'm on Fire"" is performed on his first trip to England, when it wasn't recorded until 1962.
Don't expect much, just thrill to the music here, and you won't be disappointed.",978220800,26,3368,4.633779264214047
156098,4,0792899458,"This movie rocks and rolls from the very beginning.  You see a young Jerry Lee being exposed to his early influences...to the making of a rock n roll star in Memphis, home of cool.  Dennis does a fabulous job portraying Jerry  Lee.

I've always maintained that the key to enjoying this  over-the-top bio pic is to imagine that Quaid based his whole performance  on Foghorn Leghorn. Winona here began the slide into disappointing movies  that has stalled the beauty's career, and Alec Baldwin's ""Cousin, you  still got that coin I gave ya?"" spiel is priceless. Even the musical  numbers seem dopey. Prepare to laugh...",957139200,,612,4.836538461538462

156233,1,0792899458,"I've never been able to watch this movie. I have only seen bits of it here and there. I caught the beginning of the movie the other day and I had to turn it off. The movie is a slapstick comedy. I'm sure Jerry Lee Lewis made a fool of himself many times over in his life. I'm sure the man has made a lot of questionable decisions and committed offensive acts along the way. This movie, however, does not take the man serious at any time. Right out of the gates Jerry Lee Lewis is treated as if he was some sort of cartoon character. I'd like to watch a movie about JLL which treats the man, the artist, with some DIGNITY and RESPECT. Yes, we all know JLL married his cousin. And even one of the Baldwin brothers, is it Adam, is in the movie. He is a preacher, and I think Jerry's cousin. He too is a foolish stereotype, a cartoon character. Having stated this I like Dennis Quaid's work as an actor but not when it insults and parades foolishness across the movie screen. We all should have a movie made about our worst and most foolish qualities and behaviors. No, really we shouldn't but that's what was done to Jerry Lee Lewis. I mean, maybe JLL is and was a total jerk but why make such a foolish load of nonsense movie. The movie is unbelievable from the start.",1404086400,2,1266,4.192622950819672
156234,4,0792899458,"I read several articles about this movie that said it took Dennis Quaid a while to get ""in character"" and had a hard time getting out of character to the point it jeopardized his marriage. I can imagine having ""Jerry Lee' going around the house flinging back his hair would get old after a while! Great movie, good choices on actors to play parts. Most people didn't know Jimmy Swaggart & Mickey Gilley are his cousins. This guy burned like a sparkler his whole life. I worked with a man who was his promoter. I asked (of course) what it was like. He just looked down, snickered and said ""Oh, man...Sex, drugs & rock & roll!""",1403740800,,625,4.396551724137931

The movie portrays his wife Mona and his family as ignorant idiots. The whole tone of the film is incredibly insulting. Not surprisingly, Lewis later turned against the film. I'm amazed he didn't read the script first. It does have one redeeming quality, though. The music, which was all newly recorded for the film by Jerry Lee when he was cooperative, is excellent.

156291,3,0792899458,"Great Balls of Fire!, 1989 film

The story begins in Christmastime 1944. Two boys visit a forbidden place. Jerry Lee Lewis watches attentively. Years later he plays the piano with amazing flourishes (1956). He is sent to Memphis Tennessee and want to record for Sun Records. Jerry explains his marital history. Sam Phillips listens to his demo tapes; he can sell that! ""Crazy Arms"" is a hit. Money is needed to popularize a product. Jerry Lee is advised to serve God by his cousin. He revives an old song ""Whole Lot of Shaking""; too risqu? We see why they put chicken wire in front of the musicians. Jerry appears on a NY television show. He is now a star! ""Savage animal rhythms""? Who will guard him from his fans? [No scandals to keep the money rolling in.] Some worry about the H-bomb because of what they are told in school. Jerry comforts his cousin Myra.

Hooking up with Jerry was a good business decision. ""Great Balls of Fire"" is a big hit with its pumping piano style. Alan Freed's Rock and Roll shows at the Paramount in Brooklyn attract crowds. Girls go crazy over Jerry! He stops by a high school. [Note the clothes.] Jerry gets a Marriage License. Should they wait? Myra Gale Brown gets married in Mississippi [legal age?]. They plan to tour in England, Jerry Lee is bigger there than Elvis. Myra's father is armed and angry, Sam Phillips talks to him. Myra leaves her parents to live with Jerry in a pink house with a blue door. Jerry sings ""Breathless"". Myra shops to furnish their home. Does Jerry have any remorse? No. They will tour England together. A four-engine Lockheed Constellation flies across the Atlantic. A reporter learns about Myra's age. ""She's only a baby."" There is unfavorable publicity. ""This is a big deal!"" The audience is cool and quiet when Jerry plays.

This tour is a financial flop. They are not wanted there. Expelled from Britain! There is a cold reception back home. [This tells you something about the culture then.] Do people need to look down on the rich and famous? That explains the weekly scandal magazines.] Can Jerry's career be saved by an apology and a full page ad in `Billboard'? Should he apologize for his marriage to a girl? His audience and appeal shrink. He starts to act crazy after this. [The stress?] He is angry with his wife too. Then they have a child, Steve Allen Lewis in 1959. The story ends here. Jerry Lee continued to perform in small venues for the rest of his life. [What would've happened to Mozart if he lived longer?]

Before Rock `n' Roll in the early 1950s three record companies owned 90% of the market. Afterwards thirty companies owned 90% of the market. The stock of those big three corporations dropped a lot. They struck back. Elvis was drafted (yet remained popular). Chuck Berry was arrested after his tour bus carried a woman across a state line (his career never recovered). Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens had a fatal accident, so too Eddie Cochrane. You saw Jerry's fate. But there were new stars in the 1960s, like the Beach Boys and their Surfing Sound. Then the groups from England were quite successful. That 1959 Congressional Investigation into `payola' created headlines and changed management policy at radio stations. The decay of the movie business went on as television corporations prospered and took away advertising from the weekly magazines that began to fail. ""Change is the only constant in this world"" said Heraclitus. [The British press does not have the same censorship as the American press. If you read the ""Manchester Guardian Weekly"" you would see the difference in reporting the news.]

156316,5,0792899458,"I do love this movie, if only because I have always loved Jerry Lee Lewis, and think that he is so incredibly hokey as to be fantastically, uniquely great.
I mean, his ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On"" has been one of the very greatest rock and roll anthems ever.
And he is without peer as a country artist.  Nobody has ever sung a more significant country song than ""Another Place, Another Time,"" or ""She Still Comes Around To Love What's Left Of Me.""
But what I can't understand is why Dennis Quaid played him to be as squirrely as he comes across.
Because if Jerry Lee had any say-so as to how he was portrayed, I just can't see him giving the OK to what came out on film.
I could see arrogant, or supremely self-assured, or cock-sure, or brash, or even pushy, but not strangely almost effeminate, as Dennis Quaid has portrayed him.
Jerry Lee was and is supremely talented, but I can't believe that he ever had a single day where he acted as off-the-wall as Dennis Quaid made him out to be.
And the fact that he married his 13 year-old 2nd cousin, I think she was, was not even that far-fetched, given the time and place.
But anyway, the movie is terrific, just seeing the history of how Jerry Lee was exposed to the kind of music that formed his background.  Also, seeing the cars that were commonplace in the fifties, such as the Olds 98s and the Cadillac El Dorados makes it a fun movie to watch.
Oh, for those good old days, when we really did drive those cars, and listen to and dance to that music.",1320883200,4,1503,4.307420494699647

Like one of the reviewer's grandmothers, I used to dance around the house to Jerry Lee's rock 'n roll, especially the unforgettable, lively ""Great Balls of Fire."" He was a riot then and he's a riot now!

I love, love, love this movie...because it's lively, fun and makes me feel good! I did feel sad for Jerry Lee and his teen bride. Even though she was young, they loved each other and my heart broke to see them misunderstood and his music banned because of his marrying her at such a young age (thirteen). The English treated them disgracefully, and I don't blame him for not apologizing...at great cost to his career.

To view the way Jerry Lee and Myra defied everyone and stuck together through thick and thin was tender, moving and rather sweet. Bittersweet moments! And even though this rock 'n roll legend was a rebel and a bit cocky, you couldn't help but love the guy...

Dennis Quaid was riotous in the role of Jerry Lee, and Winona Ryder was perfect as the very cute, adorable teen. They were both lovable (and naive in many ways). I thought I'd die laughing when she took her doll house with her as she moved from her father's home to live with her new husband. (And wait till you see Alec Baldwin carrying on as a stereotypical Baptist preacher; even though his role was rather laughable, he did a great job of acting...lol)

Kudos to this cast and the producers for a few hours of almost nonstop laughter, dished up with the bittersweet romance.

I won't forget this film for a long time. Even though certain parts were left out of ""The Killer's"" life, this movie managed to give the main details and give us a good concept of his life and lots of great rock 'n roll.

It's heartening to know he's still performing and as popular as in his heyday. Rock on, Jerry Lee!

156321,5,0792899458,"This is a great movie about the young, defiant Jerry Lee (A.K.A. ""The Killer"").Its a story about him growing up down in Ferriday, Louisiana, (my home state) along with his cousin the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart. I'm been to the house Jerry Lee grew up in. Its a museam now, operated by one of his sisters. When Jerry Lee was a kid, he would sneek over to the black juke joints, and listen to their music. He loved it. During this movie, from childhool on up, Jerry Lee and his cousin the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart were always in conflict. Rev. Swaggart believed Rock & Roll was the Devil's Music, and he thought that Jerry Lee was a sinner for playing it. Anyway, Jerry Lee ""stuck to his guns"", and kept performing Rock & Roll music.

Jerry Lee wanted to become a star like Elvis, so he set his sights on Memphis, and Sam Phillips with Sun Records. He moved to Memphis, got a record deal with Sam Phillips and Sun Records. He moved in with relatives in Memphis, I believe it was his first cousin and his wife and their 13 year old daughter Myra. Anyway, this ""1st cousin"" was the bass player in Jerry Lee's band. Jerry and Myra got close, and even though Jerry Lee had already been married twice. He got a Marriage Licence and secrely married his 2nd cousin Myra at age 13. When her dad found out, he got really mad and started to try and kill Jerry Lee, but Sam Phillips talked him out of it. He gradually accepted it, and remained a bass player in Jerry Lee's band. Jerry Lee's marriage to Myra lasted 13 years. He's been married at least 6 times and I think this was the longed marriage, he ever had.

One really good part of the Movie, is a concert with Chuck Berry. The people in charge told Jerry Lee, he had to start the concert and Chuck would follow him. This made Jerry Lee mad. He said ""nobody follows the Killer"". Anyway, he agreed and when he was performing his last sone ""Great Balls of Fire"", he poured lighter fluid on the piano and set it on fire, as he played the song. The Audience went WILD. After that, when Jerry Lee was leaving the stage, he told Chuck Berry ""Follow that""!!!

Anyway, Sam Phillips scheduled an English Tour for Jerry Lee, and against the advise of Sam Phillips, Jerry Lee took along his 13 year old bride Myra. Anyway, when the press found out about his marriage to his cousin a 13 year old, they turned against him. At his first concert the crowd just sit there and showed no emotion. This made Jerry Lee so mad, that he pushed the piano off the stage. Anyway, all his shows were cancelled in England, and he was ordered out of the Country. His last words for England - ""England can Kiss My A**"".

Jerry Lee made a come-back, with an appearance on the Steve Allen show. He and Myra had a son Steve Allen Lewis (who later drowned) and a daughter who is still living.

Anyway, it ends with Jerry Lee being at the Rev. Swaggard's church, where the Rev. was peaching directly to Jerry Lee, and about him playing ""the Devil's Music"". Jerry Lee gets up and says ""Well If I'm going to Hell, I'm going there playing the piano"". He and Myra leave the church. The movie soon ends.

I grew up in this type of environment, and now I can say, thankfully attitudes about Rock & Roll have changed down here in Louisiana, and the ""Bible Belt"". Rock & Roll is now not necessarily regarded as the devil's music. It is generally accepted by everyone down here. Also, now Jerry Lee and his cousin the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart are not in conflict with one another. Jerry Lee usually performs some gospel songs in his concerts. Thanks!!!!!",1266278400,4,3539,4.3545454545454545

I admit when both Bakker and Swaggart fell I was harsh with them, and I guess I felt it was my right because it gave me creedence to the way I lived my lifestyle. Do all others feel the same way?

156370,3,0792899458,"When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought ""wow, Dennis Quaid is hot."" I'm too young to remember Jerry Lee Lewis, but I have heard his music. Dennis Quaid does an admirable job of bringing Jerry Lee Lewis' story to us.
Winona Ryder is okay. I think she's a wishy-washy actress. Sometimes she's great, sometimes she bores me. Unfortunately, this was one of the boring performances. Granted, she was playing a whiny teenager, that may have swayed my opinion.
The story is a good one, but now I intend to read a biography about Jerry Lee Lewis, as I'm sure much was left out about this man's colorful life.
As an aside, my pre-teen daughter had many questions about the behavior of the two cousins...so I probably should have watched it when she was not around.
Bottom line, if you are huge fan of either actors or the story, buy it...otherwise, rent it.",1059609600,4,857,4.535483870967742
156371,3,0792899458,"Jerry Lee Lewis's rise to fame and marraige to his 13-year-old cousin are given a superficial treatment.  Dennis Quaid, Winona Ryder, and other cast members do a good job, but the screenplay glosses over certain details of his life without going into much depth.",1041984000,2,262,4.954545454545454
156372,2,0792899458,"Maybe Hollywood should just give up trying to produce a decent musical biography. ""The Jolson Story"" did not tell the real story at all and was saved by lavish (and now embarrassing) production numbers. The recent ""Little Richard"" made-for-TV movie also took major liberties. ""The Benny Goodman Story"" with Steve Allen from 1955 was a moderate success.
Well, Al Jolson, Little Richard, and Steve Allen are all important names to Jerry Lee Lewis, but it's too bad that when it comes to bringin' his own story to the big screen, he most likely shares the same disappointment all three must have felt when they watched the finished product. Once again, it's looks like the powers-that-be had to exaggerate where it was absolutely unnecessary.
Exaggeration is the word for Dennis Quaid's performance as ""The Killer"". The actor's genuine affection for the legend is obvious, but somehow the portrayal runs askance - the subject is treated as a one-dimensional, slow-witted, overgrown adolescent who doesn't even realize his own talent. His ability is projected as compulsive rather than creative. Thankfully, Jerry Lee himself stepped in to insist on recording the soundtrack himself - unbelievably (it is reported) that Quaid wanted to perform the songs himself! Winona Ryder, as the 13 year old bride, is the only convincing performance.
Instead of making the early concerts look as realistic (and as exciting) as possible, somebody decided to make these spontaneous events look like outtakes from ""Bye Bye Birdie"".
Books like ""Killer!"" by Jerry Lee Lewis and Charles White (Arrow, UK), ""Hellfire"" by Nick Tosches (Dell, USA), the recent ""The Devil, Me, and Jerry Lee"" by Linda Gail Lewis with Les Pendleton (Longstreet, USA), and ofcourse Myra Lewis' and Murray Silver's ""Great Balls Of Fire! - The Uncensored Story Of Jerry Lee Lewis""(St. Martin's Press, USA) describe in great detail the the kid who played ""God Is Real"" with a beat.
For those who know nothing of Jerry Lee, this is not a bad place to start, but make sure that videos such as ""Jerry Lee Lewis: I Am What I Am"" (Hallway Productions, Inc./J2 Communications) follow up soon.",1036281600,9,2138,5.0594900849858355
156373,5,0792899458,"Goodness, gracious.. Great Balls of Fire is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Based on the life of Jerry Lee Lewis, responsible for such classic oldies as (obviously) ""Great Balls of Fire,"" and ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,"" it truly keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  Dennis Quaid stars as 'The Killer' himself and portrays the ups and downs of Lewis' rocky road to success quite superbly.  Staying with relatives, Jerry Lee meets and quickly moves in on his thirteen year old cousin, Myra (played by Winona Ryder, who gives Quaid a run for his money with her own stunning performance), immediately after his first song plays on the radio.  People automatically love the song, and so begins the story of unbelievable success, love, and scandals -- every plot twist and turn that you would expect from a soap opera -- but these events actually DID happen!  Keeping that in mind throughout the movie only makes it that much better.  At times quite serious and dramatic, Great Balls of Fire keeps it just light enough to be absolutely hilarious at just the right times. In addition to the quite intriguing plot, this movie is also an in-depth look into the lifestyle of the fifties and sixties, and how what we don't give as much as a second thought to these days is what made heads spin back then.  A definite must-see for fans AND non-fans of Jerry Lee Lewis, as it is a very informative and extremely entertaining movie.",1032652800,14,1433,4.640316205533597

156375,4,0792899458,"Dennis Quaid does a very good job of playing JERRY LEE LEWIS but the music performed by the real Jerry Lee Lewis is the hit of the movie.  Jerry will be 67 years old in september of this year and can still rock as hard as anyone.  there is only one JERRY LEE LEWIS.  Do yourself a favor and see him while you can.  As they say in the movie,  Jerry Lee is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight.",1027728000,2,406,3.962962962962963
156376,5,0792899458,"I love this movie! Dennis Quaid is a perfect Jerry Lee Lewis!
He perfectly portrays the HOT wildman Jerry Lee was! This a great movie and has the BEST music ever played in it. After all Jerry Lee Lewis has a ferocious God given talent on him!",1026172800,,242,4.170212765957447
156377,4,0792899458,"To those who are enthralled by Jerry Lee Lewis's music (and I'm one), the music in this movie makes up for some flaws that might have been more detracting in another film. Specifically, the music is great because the soundtrack was performed by the Killer himself(as new recordings,I believe)...but the acting is overwrought with Dennis Quaid missing the mark, in my humble opinion, due primarily to his overly exuberant portrayal of Jerry Lee which obviously is intended to convey the Killer's over-the-top personality and on-stage antics but which, to my eye, comes off as more cartoonish than exuberant. Ryder's portrayal of his first cousin once removed and, ultimately, his wife is too pouty and babyish even for the thirteen year old she's supposed to be.
Oddly enough, despite these criticisms the movie remains thoroughly enjoyable due in no small part to the genius of Lewis's musical performances which are rock and roll epitomized.
One final thought here is how this movie reveals how drastically we have changed as a society (and probably not for the better) in that the music industry and the public destroyed Lewis's career over the indiscretion of falling in love with and marrying his underage cousin. Yet, today, much more despicable behavior in the current generation of pop musicians, such as rape,violence,drugs,suicide,intollerance and sexual immorality is more likely to rocket them to superstardom then to oblivion. Goodness, gracious....C'est la vie! To sum up: The movie's worth the fourteen bucks, even if they have the nerve not to include a single word of liner notes. Enjoy.",1025049600,9,1603,5.193050193050193
156378,4,0792899458,"This film is highly entertaining, primarily because of Jerry Lee's music.  The script gets sappy in some places, especially when it tries to ""justify"" Jerry Lee's obsession for his young cousin.  But when the music is going, it's a gas.  The DVD features an excellent transfer, and has the trailer as well.  The only thing I miss is the video with Dennis Quaid and the Killer himself that was on the beginning of the old VHS tape.  Otherwise, I recommend this DVD.",1024272000,,464,4.609756097560975
156379,5,0792899458,"As far as recreating the rock and roll related events of Jerry Lee's life, this movie is tops.  Dennis Quade gives 110% as the hard rocking musician.  Under the instruction of the man himself, Dennis quade learns how to play all the great songs on the piano.  As your watching the movie...you are actually watching Dennis play that piano.  Jerry Lee was a fireball in his early days and this movie shows how crazy he really got to be.  Entertaining, insightful and as rocking as you could ask for; this movie shows there IS a whole lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than Great Balls of Fire.  Seeing him rock out with Dennis Quade at the end of the movie was an added bonus...the Killer still has it!",1014854400,14,694,4.3828125

7792595,4,0792899458,"The freewheeling ""Great Balls of Fire!"" (1989) has as much historical inaccuracy as 1978's ""The Buddy Holly Story."" However, it's good rockin' any night. Dennis Quaid burns up the screen as the inimitable Jerry Lee Lewis while effectively lip-synching to the Killer's classic recordings. Director Jim McBride keeps the biopic moving at a frenzied clip while embracing its outlandish Hollywood gloss. Not surprisingly, Jerry Lee despised the cinematic whitewash yet admired Quaid's fiery portrayal.",1486857600,,497,5.72972972972973
