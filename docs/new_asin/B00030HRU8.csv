2155670,5,B00030HRU8,"Dr. Eggerichs hits the nail right on the head every time. This is a must see for everyone--married or single, if you are Christian or not. The content/information presented about male and female human nature is wise and insightful, to say the least. No 'new-age' mumbo-jumbo here! Man and woman are not equal in the way we think or act, and the sooner we all understand this, the better off our relationships will be! This series is very serious, as well as hilarious. His passion on this topic is apparent, and his humor will make you laugh. In the end, you will have important information to last you a lifetime. Outstanding to say the least.",1317859200,3,644,4.608695652173913

8035776,5,B00030HRU8,"We have enjoyed and been blessed by experiencing this series twice in small groups. We definitely recommend repeated visits, as we all need rejuvenation and reminders, but what's even better is getting deeper and sharing more within couples and within a great, trusting group. Can't help but grow closer throughout, and we have made dear friends in addition to learning how to better blend our own marriage. We bought this set to share with our other loved ones, beginning with our daughter and son-in-law. We learned this entire series is helpful for any stage and length of marriage, and we hope to share its blessings and our love. Our thanks to Dr. Eggerichs!",1498780800,,663,4.876106194690266
