2602834,1,B000GAKB9O,This is one of the worst fireplace videos I have ever seen.  Most of the screen is filled by a wall rather than the actual fire.  The sound is also lackluster.,1256774400,12,159,4.096774193548387
2602835,3,B000GAKB9O,"I do not have a high definition tv - but have a good tv.  I like the ""Sierra Nevada Log Cabin Fireplace"" and the ""Virtual Flames"" dvds better than this.  This has a nice roaring fire but the colors are dimmer than the other ones.",1227139200,13,229,4.066666666666666
2602836,5,B000GAKB9O,"I was going crazy trying to figure out a way to study my schoolwork but not become distracted. I found that with the TV off, my brain would search around the room for something to do. When I had the TV on and muted, I was always distracted by the action on the TV. I bought this DVD on a whim partly because it had the 16:9 ratio and I wanted to see how it looked on my new TV + plus it was cheap - why spend money on something you may only view a few times as a novelty? Anyhow, I had a paper to write that I had been avoiding for weeks. I just couldn't get it started or maintain focus for more thana few minutes. I popped this DVD in since there was nothing on. I found that the fireplace with the ambient sounds was perfect for my task. I was able to concentrate and when I wanted to think, looking at the fireplace was a relaxing distraction without taking my mind away from the task at hand. I am now on the search for more of these types of DVD's to run while I am working on studies. This was fabulous - and quite a deal! Quality in 16:9 was excellent. the logs are real and there is someone who tends the fire and adds a log now and then. The music is OK, but the ambient sound is best as far as I am concerned - although it was hard to hear so I had to turn up the volume quite a bit. Still, a great video for the price.",1221436800,20,1330,3.822463768115942
2602837,5,B000GAKB9O,Years ago I saw this at a party. This year I went to a New Year's Eve party in warm south Florida and bought this DVD as a house gift for the hostess. It looked especially great on the large screen tv and we had the version of Christmas music playing. It created a nice ambience and a gathering around the tv. I have this dvd and sometimes I put in on to sleep to. I miss my fireplace here in Florida and it's the next best thing.,1390521600,,430,3.897727272727273
2602838,4,B000GAKB9O,"I do not have a fireplace in my current home, but I love the ambiance it creates. .This DVD is perfect for recreating the feeling. I really enjoy the Christmas song selection. I would recommend this disk to a friend. I only took a star off, because the picture is not HD quality, but it is lovely enough for me and my family!",1385164800,,325,4.174603174603175
2602839,5,B000GAKB9O,"A friend of mine lives in a small trailer. She loves coming to my home and sitting in front of my fireplace, listening to the crackling sound of the logs and watching the flames flicker. I found this DVD and mailed it to her for a sursprise. She LOVES it. Now she sits in front of her own ""fireplace"" and enjoys the sound of logs crackling and flames flickering while she reads a book. Thanks so much!!!!!

2602840,5,B000GAKB9O,"This is very nice, a rip roaring fire with out the smoke and the clean up.... Isn't it nice to sit and watch and not worry about any thing but the fireplace, very relaxing with a cup of hot cocoa who can miss??",1359072000,,210,3.9069767441860463
2602841,5,B000GAKB9O,our tv sits in a corner and it looks so cozy and warm... it feels warmer just looking at it....,1356220800,,95,3.8
2602842,5,B000GAKB9O,"Every year I put this dvd away w/the Christmas decorations and throughout the year I sometimes reflect on the warm ambiance it will bring when the holiday season rolls around again. I love it, my family loves it! The music is fantastic, classical guitar and Mozart, and the ambient sound of a cracking fireplace if you should choose. Occassionally, in the fireplace video, an arm reaches across the screen to move a log in the fire, which I find hilarious!  I bought this from one of those bargain bins a few years back. I actually came to Amazon today to search it out specifically b/c I'd like to give it as a gift to a couple of friends that I know will enjoy it. Buy a few, you will want to share!",1355356800,,701,4.3106060606060606
2602843,5,B000GAKB9O,I feel I have a real fireplace in my home and I love the crackling and the placement of a log on the hearth.,1355011200,,108,3.5416666666666665
2602844,5,B000GAKB9O,I got this fireplace DVD I live in a small apartment and turn this on at night and sleep it almost like a real fireplace,1351468800,,120,3.84
2602845,3,B000GAKB9O,"The video itself was nice. Not as nice as others, but just fine. What I was dissatisfied with was that the case was cracked when it arrived. I figured since I paid only two dollars for it I wouldn't complain, but I wouldn't get another movie from that same seller.",1332979200,,264,4.3
2602846,5,B000GAKB9O,"I bought a dvd at Amazon as a gift for my sister,she just loved it, especially on ""cold"" nights,lol.  This DVD gives you a lot of fun. Get your friends together, bring out the ""pickies"" and don't forget the wine. You can even hear the cracklin sounds. It looks and sounds real.",1326672000,,277,4.326923076923077
2602847,3,B000GAKB9O,"I much preferred the one I bought years ago, the fire was much nicer, more flames etc. more enticing. All this was, was one log that kept burning the same, plus you saw some guys arm come across to put a falling log back on.....The one big advantage I liked what the music, that you could play background music, that was the trade off. It did the trick but I will look for the one I had previously, much nicer flames, even my family thought so too.",1326240000,,448,4.160919540229885
2602848,5,B000GAKB9O,"Never thought I'd write a review for something like this, but it was a last minute stocking stuffer for my other half last year, & wound up being the favored gift of all time.. All our friends wanted one as well. It loops instead of ending every hour, like the others I've tried.. Which makes it perfect for parties. We keep the fired roaring in three rooms during the season. Highly recommend for the price, can't be beat.",1324166400,,423,4.435897435897436
2602849,2,B000GAKB9O,they seemed more into displaying their stone work than the fire. too much zooming in and out. not as clear as expected for a blu ray,1323993600,,132,4.115384615384615
2602850,5,B000GAKB9O,"I love this dvd!  It keeps our den nice and cozy on a cold, winter's night here in chilly Arizona!",1294185600,,98,3.9
2602851,5,B000GAKB9O,Ordered with out a hitch. Was delivered right on time and it was just Extreamly nice during the holidays. Over whelmingly pleased!!,1293667200,,131,5.0
2602852,5,B000GAKB9O,"I bought this for Thanksgiving and Christmas at my house...but we use it all year too!  It's great when you don't want people blaring your tv on family occasions...I just put this on and people love it!  The crackling noise is my favorite...very soothing.  The music is classical, mozart or Christmas.  Very nice.  The picture is a tad disappointing...it's not very high quality...but this is still a very enjoyable dvd.  We have a 46'' flat Vizio on the wall and this is perfect for it.  Love it.  Buy it!",1284508800,3,506,4.606741573033708
2602853,2,B000GAKB9O,"This all-wood fire has great coals underneath and real fire sounds.

The DVD starts with an FBI warning, a short movie leader, a disclaimer that some imperfections are unavoidable, and a menu in standard (4:3) aspect ratio.  You then have six options, all with natural fire sounds:  standard or wide (16:9), with no music, Mozart, or Christmas music.  We bought this for the natural sounds, but the classical guitar Christmas music appeals.  The Mozart is fierce and a little brassy, maybe OK if you turn it way down.

The fire is round logs, with one in front straight across, on crude andirons.  The framing of the picture could have been improved by moving the andirons farther apart and using longer or more wood:  there is too much of the side walls of the fireplace visible, and yet the top few inches of some flames disappear off the top of the screen.  I like the occasional tending of the fire, as you would do yourself, but my wife finds it intrusive.  The video seems to have been shot from fire level, rather than a more normal down angle.  The andirons and large front log are too prominent, and the colors seem washed out.

Unfortunately, there is a hum on the sound track - it sounds just like our ceiling fan on medium, as heard from the room above.  This may be the sound of the fire itself, resonating inside the steel-walled fireplace.  In other words, it may be accurate, but distracting.

2602854,1,B000GAKB9O,This is not a full screen fire like it looks on the cover. It would have been so easy to take a better full screen shot of a burning fire. I'm disappointed to say the least.,1266451200,2,173,3.8333333333333335
2602855,1,B000GAKB9O,I was very disappointed.  I bought this as a gift.  First it shows a fire and fireplace from a distance with all the brick work. Later it zooms in somewhat but you are viewing the fire through the doors.  It is also not an eternal flame.  Meaning the DVD ends.  I was trying to purchase one like I have(purchased from Amazon several years ago).  That one just shows the fire and it does not end.,1264809600,4,395,4.2
2602856,5,B000GAKB9O,"This video is the best video in the world!!!! The Christmas music is very relaxing - classic guitar. The fireplace scenes make me feel warm.

We have a fireplace, but would cost money to have it cleaned and is a hassle and really gives off only slightly more heat than the TV when watching this video.

There's Mozart, Christmas music, or crackling sounds depending on what you like. My video was from[...]  - Looks like this one with same name, so I'm pretty sure its the same one.",1261699200,4,482,4.454545454545454
