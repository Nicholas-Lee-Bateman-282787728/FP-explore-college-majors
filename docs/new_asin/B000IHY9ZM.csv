8145846,5,B000IHY9ZM,"This short (47 min) DVD is a gem.  Just the right amount of background to get us to know a little of the artist - mostly in his own words; with the primary focus on his wonderful artistry and enchanting music.  Most of the music is Michihiro Sato on an empty stage, playing to the viewer - no audience to get in the way.  Highly recommended.",1169856000,,341,4.136363636363637
