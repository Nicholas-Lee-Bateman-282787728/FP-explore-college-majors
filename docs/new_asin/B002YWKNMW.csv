4013925,5,B002YWKNMW,"I bought this DVD earlier this year to motivate me to exercise, get fit and lose weight. The ""Tour de Basement"" was not very motivating, and neither was riding my bike while yelling at the evening news. I have really enjoyed this DVD, and I have lost 40# in 5 months. (I also bought other BtBOP - Behind the Bars of Paul --  DVDs, as well as a few scenic treks and training videos from others).

Paul Gallas filmed this DVD while riding with a bike club in Alaska. It is an evening ride through beautiful country. But as Paul says on many of his DVDs : ""This is a workout video... not a scenic trek. You're not a tourist, but an active participant. Stop watching and start doing."" So while the view is nice and a bear makes an appearance, the photography is a bit shaky in places and it is dusk and drizzly.  It is a bit hard to understand the bike club members as they describe the scenery. Some ""scenic"" DVDs are prettier. Remember, you are not a tourist! The strengths of this DVD  are the unique ""dashboard"" and Paul's inspiring instruction and commentary.
The ""dashboard"" includes suggestions for gear ratios / bike resistance, cadence and  percent of max heart rate.  As it is impossible to match all 3 at the same time, I concentrate on bike resistance and/or cadence. There are also 2 color coded graphs of the effort and the hill profile for the entire ride, with a marker to show where you are. There is also a little GPS inset showing topography, speed and the location of the bear. The screen is busy, but all of this information is interesting and Paul puts it all to good use as he guides the participant to build endurance, burn calories and become proficient at cycling.
At first, I could not do the entire DVD  -- perhaps only 30 or 40 minutes. After using this DVD nearly every day for a month, I could do the whole video and I found that I was telling Paul what he was going to say next. You have to finish the video to see the bear. That is when I knew that I needed to have other DVDs. I did not feel ready for some of his hard core training DVDs. Fortunately, Paul had another Extreme Calorie Burner program and had just published his first Heart Health program. These are also wonderful, and I rotate all of them with the scenic treks.
I am very happy that I found this program and recommend it highly.",1318896000,,2325,4.3310344827586205
4013926,5,B002YWKNMW,"I live in a community where the cycling , 8 months out of the year, is truly amazing. I am in the Eastern Sierra. I ride to work , and as much as possible. I enjoy these when I am not able to ride like I would like to.  I figure as opposed to playing video games, might as well do some thing that enhances my cycling experience, as opposed to always looking at cycling s a work out, when you should be enjoying the time out doors. The videos are so real, that when it turns , and you are on your trainer,your equilibrium is thrown a bit. You want a real work out, throw on some leg weights...This is a great way to stay in cycling shape in the winter months, or when you just are short on time ....",1318896000,,698,3.915492957746479
4013927,5,B002YWKNMW,I love this video! Actually riding this trail is now on my bucket list. I am drenched after every workout. I can't give enough praise. The music works. The scenery is breathtaking and if i don't want to do the full 1hr50min i just do 1/2! FUN WORKOUT! so rewarding to complete.,1303689600,6,277,4.346153846153846

4013929,5,B002YWKNMW,"After receiving a few of Pauls workout DVD's for Christmas and loving them I invested in some more a few weeks ago.  I purchased the package of 3 Alaska DVD's and this one has to be my favorite.  First, I love the scenery.  I feel like I am riding on the trail with Paul and his buddies and it is so beautiful.  My kids watch the DVD while I am riding and I think they enjoy it just as much as me.  Second, it's a great workout.  Not as hard as some of Pauls others but that's what I like about it.  I have labeled this DVD as my reward DVD.  I get to do this ride when I have completed my other rides during the week.  There are no long, hard climbs which is a really nice change, no pace lines, no screaming descents, just a fun, energetic and interesting ride to end my week on.",1300406400,2,781,3.9235668789808917
4013930,2,B002YWKNMW,"The DVD was defective so almost half way through my workout I had to stop and start the DVD all over again.  The music is decent so I gave this two stars. However, the view is not great at all.  This was definitely not recorded by a professional so what should have been scenic views were mainly patches of dark gray/black views with bright colors coming from the cyclists gear.  Don't waste your money.",1296864000,2,403,4.418918918918919
4013931,5,B002YWKNMW,"was really debating on this video or one by another company I am very pleased that I went with this one.  There is tons of on screen info What gear to be in, cadence, and percent of max heart-rate.  Very pleased will order more",1294272000,14,227,4.136363636363637
4013932,5,B002YWKNMW,"This is one of several BtBoP workouts that we now own and they are all fantastic.  This was a great workout and we actually felt the thrill of riding in Alaska, even out here in far West Texas.  There were some problems with having to wipe water off of the camera lens but after all, it rains in Alaska!  As with all of Paul's workouts, you have to keep yourself honest because there's no coach there yelling at you to ""keep it up"".  All that you need to push yourself into a hard workout is there on the screen.  If you try to match the intensity level showing on the screen, you are definitely going to be sweating and you'll know at the end of the workout that you've worked hard.

The only thing that we sort of wish is that there was a time indicator on the screen showing how much time is remaining in the workout.

Thanks for the great ride, Paul.  We loved seeing the bear!",1264550400,8,881,4.171597633136095
4013933,5,B002YWKNMW,"I have purchased several of the virtual reality videos from ""Behind the Bars with Paul"" and this is one of my favorites for burning calories.  The workout is plenty long enough, to give burn off that extra slice of pizza.  The virtual reality of the ride brings you into the ride and you can forget you are not actually out on the road.  What beautiful country to put some miles in. The heads up information that is supplied on the screen keeps you honest in your effort and you can make it very real and in doing so.  I would highly recommend any of Paul's videos wanting a great way to workout or just get in some indoor miles.",1261526400,17,629,4.260504201680672

My daughter ordered me a much better indoorcycling DVD over Amazon that I can realy use and feel good training with. CATHE spinning DVD. Would highly recommend this training DVD instead.

4013936,5,B002YWKNMW,"It is very hard spinning at home because you have a really really energetic instructor and really awesome music to keep you going and motivated. Although that kind of spinning DVD has thus far eluded me personally, I have really enjoyed this pack.  It is very easy to ride along with the riders and take in the scenery.  Not having a monitor on my bike makes it difficult to follow the beats per minute, but, it gets the job done and really does make it seem like you are biking through these amazing locations.  It is also a great feature to ride along to the lead cyclist and to their music, or, to music of your own.",1386547200,,619,4.273504273504273
4013937,5,B002YWKNMW,"Awesome ride a long with this video. Scenery is awesome, options for playing the music, raw audio, or narrative is great. I've ridden with this video several times thru & not tired of it...I see different little bits of scenery every time I ride. I will definately purchase another video in this series.",1386460800,,303,4.735849056603773

4013939,1,B002YWKNMW,"I was really looking forward to getting this video after reading all the great reviews, but after watching the first few minutes I realized I had been duped. If you look at the good reviews you will see that many of them are not ""verified purchase"" which leads me to wonder if they are a set-up to convince you to purchase a terrible video. Unfortunately the scenic route is primarily the butts of the other riders. There was nothing scenic about this video. The camera work is shoddy, the sounds you hear are primarily that of a freeway and cars rushing by along with some indistinct chatters with the other riders. The individual doing the filming spends most of his time in a rather crowded position with other riders which ruins the scenery. I wasted $21.00 and feel like I was ""set-up"" by the other reviews which feel as though they must be fake. I'll never buy one of Paul's videos again.",1378339200,2,894,4.5246913580246915
4013940,4,B002YWKNMW,"I liked the video, pretty views. After a couple of rides, you will probably want to turn off all but ambient sounds.  Music can be a bit annoying.  I really liked the cadence notes and heart rate that I could try to match. The gear  setting for actual ride is good for folks on trainers. A tension score of 1-10 is helpful for exercise/ spinner crowd.  Cadence varies form 60-1 100+ rpm, so a nice workout. About 2 hour, easily broken up int 30 minute or 1 hour section.

Will probably buy others in the series.",1371859200,,511,4.28125
4013941,5,B002YWKNMW,"I have written multiple reviews for Paul's videos because I like his style. I like the challenge of the workout and the scenary. This one is a great example of both (challenge and scenary). It's awesome because you can go to Alaska without being eaten by a bear or freezing to death during the cold Winter months. Even though the weather is perfect now, I would need to win the lottery to go there:) Since I don't play the lottery, I will stick with virtual Alaska for now. Overall, to me this video is worth every penny. Lori",1367193600,,526,4.377551020408164
4013942,5,B002YWKNMW,"This and all of Paul's videos are actual rides with all the inconviences and nuances of group rides. These are not studio made videos. If you want actual riding conditions, conversation and some good commentary on weight loss and nutrition, this is for you. Also, this video isn't made for professional racers but for average joe's and jane's who want to become fitter through cycling. As such, they are great to simulate group rides when you can't get out. The Blu-ray video is great! Great scenery and clear with not a lot of excess shaking. The heads up display with gear changing really helps make the ride realistic. One of my favs. Overall, for what it is, it is the best out there.",1365552000,5,688,4.6016260162601625
4013943,1,B002YWKNMW,"I am sorely disappointed in this video which is nothing more than a long advertisement for the company. The ride is scenic no doubt, but it does NOT give hints for spinning at home. Instead, I had to listen to the 'instructor"" talk about the business, how long they've been in business, blah, blah, blah.....

How about a clip of the instructor actually on a spinning bike (inset) while we watch the other cyclists?????

I would not recommend this at all and wish I could have my money back.",1365552000,4,491,4.50561797752809
4013944,5,B002YWKNMW,This is great video for viewing while on the trainer. The view of the route and surrounding terrain gives you the relax feeling and takes your mind off of being inside while on the trainer. The video is clear and the lighting is just right. I give the video a five star rating. Even though spring is upon us here in the Carolina's it's make great video for bad weather days.,1365206400,,374,4.28169014084507
4013945,5,B002YWKNMW,"I really enjoy riding this video. It is perfect for my ability. I love the break in the video so if I don't have time to ride in one sitting, I can finish it later. The clicks that accompany gear changes really helps as well as the line that helps determine the 5th & 6th gear. As for the weather condition, I am very familiar with this area since my daughter lives in Kenai. I thought the weather was very nice for the area. It's usually cold & raining in the summer.",1365206400,,468,4.0978260869565215
4013946,1,B002YWKNMW,"This was the worst spin video ever!  I can not be more adamant about it.  They have technical difficulties at the beginning of the ride where the nutritionist started talking and didn't have the microphone...this is supposed to be a professional video, so why was that not edited or recorded again?  And I don't want to listen to a personal trainer try to sell his services to me while I ride, but that happens in the video as well.

So I tried watching it without sound and just put on my music.  The ride is so flat and boring!  And the guy actually takes rest stops....if I want to take a break, I can pause the video.  I don't need to stop into the bakery with the other girls on the ride!!  I don't know how they even worked up an appetite on such a flat and boring ride.  And wipe the bugs off the camera lens so I don't have to keep watching them crawl across the screen.",1364947200,4,878,4.14792899408284
4013947,1,B002YWKNMW,"Pretty awful.  There are much better virtual cycle rides out there.  Straight ride , meh scenery, and the incessant chatter of the rider.
Not recommended.  Check out [...] for the best stuff out there.",1364169600,2,201,4.852941176470588
4013948,2,B002YWKNMW,"The reviews on this were great so I was excited to try my first indoor cycling video.  The biggest problem with this video is that the resolution is awful.  They really need to do high definition versions of this stuff.  The picture quality of this when shown on my 60 inch tv was just terrible, even from across the room it was fuzzy.  Second, the whole thing is on a cloudy day.  How depressing, the only reason I ride inside is because the weather is bad and I have to be indoors.  I sure don't want to watch an ugly day on tv, would much rather see a beautiful day at the beach or something.

The commentary and shifting was good, gave me something to do.  Although they shift waaaaay too fast and often to keep up...you'd think it was a video game controller they were using and alternating between the A and B buttons.",1361577600,3,824,4.2709677419354835
4013949,2,B002YWKNMW,"well I expected to burn calories, the reason I bought it.  I use a smaller t.v. and found it difficult to see the gear I was supposed to be in until I figured out to watch the little monitor move........but my bike computer put this at just over 200 calories, not over 1200, and I realized that this was for beginners or not as advanced, my opinion only.  so I'll try different dvd's.  And yes, 2 hours in the saddle is painful.",1359244800,2,428,4.195121951219512

4013951,5,B002YWKNMW,"XCB Indian to Girdwood Alaska is my second spinning DVD from Cycling Videos Online but it will definitely not be the last one I purchase.  Indoor cycling, particularly if done at home, can be a lonely and isolating experience. ""Destination"" DVDs such as this one add an element of scenery and camaraderie to the workout time.  While this is not one of the more difficult workout DVDs I use in my routine, it is invaluable in that the duration (one hour and 54 minutes) is the perfect way to go long for maximum calorie burn.  The narrators take turns throughout the DVD offering encouragement, insight and a smattering of fitness and nutritional tips that I somehow never tire of hearing. I will probably never see the sites of Alaska or other scenic spots while riding a bike but, thanks to DVDs such as Indian to Girdwood Alaska, I get to enjoy the experience and benefit from a safe, controlled exercise workout in my home.

The dashboard information screens are motivating and keep me and my goals on track far better than I could ever hope to do on my own.  Having spent a couple of years doing my spin workouts in a crowded gym with no change of scenery and nothing but the same droning voice to urge me on, I have to admit that I much prefer the experience of riding at home using DVDs such as XCB Indian to Girdwood Alaska to keep me company.",1351814400,,1350,4.449392712550607
4013952,5,B002YWKNMW,"This is my first of Paul's videos.  It got me hooked.  This ride is probably one of the earlier in the series based on production standards, i.e. the brake cable in the camera shot.  However, that doesn't change the quality of the workout.  It's harder than it looks at first, and I still struggle to keep up with the metrics on the dashboard.

Great scenerykeeps your interest.  This is a great way to get a full ride in without leaving home.",1351555200,,443,4.407407407407407
4013953,3,B002YWKNMW,"Great idea to include various metrics on the screen to help the rider.  This video makes indoor training less boring, but the quality of the views could be better.  Unfortunately it's mostly a rainy day in Alaska when this is taped, so the screen is not very bright.  You appreciate their landscape less as a result.  The worst part is the sound.  I was unable to turn off the weird music in the background as the instructions indicate.  I will still use this video, but I will likely look for another better option.",1343692800,3,516,4.494623655913978
4013954,5,B002YWKNMW,"I just finished 1 hour and 50 minutes of the Xtreme Calorie Burner! Indian to Girdwood Alaska cycling video. I put my best effort into it and got a great workout out of it.

The secret for me is combining attention to the resistance, cadence, and the staying at the right heart rate. It works. I am telling everyone I know that workouts literally fly by with these videos. The narrative from our leader, Paul Gallas, includes very helpful information too. I always learn something.

This time,
I started out on the Precor AMT for 30 minutes.
I switched to a Precor bike.
I switched to a Cardio Glider.
I switched back to the bike.

The video works well with all of those. I've also done some of the videos while on my treadmill in the past. It's all in the motivation for me, and I get plenty of it from these very excellent videos.

I never used to push myself hard enough to work up a sweat when I exercised until I started using this system.

Even though my focus was on keeping the cadence going, making sure the heart rate was in the right range, and watching the RPM, I still got a chance to see some of the scenery. It was absolutely gorgeous. I enjoyed seeing the wild life toward the end.

Thanks for another great video!  Now to decide which one to do next. They are all good.",1330473600,2,1286,4.289256198347108
4013955,4,B002YWKNMW,"I enjoyed this ride for what it is, a not too intense ride along some pleasant scenery in Alaska.  I used this video the most shortly after I got my spin bike as I ramped back into exercising (a couple months after cycling season had ended for where I live-I'm a wimp and don't enjoy riding in the cold)  I must admit I was hoping for more dramatic scenery and it's not my favorite from Paul but I still enjoy riding to this video occasionally when I want to take it a little easier.  I like how the dashboard is real time unlike videos from some of the other makers where the numbers never quite seem to line up with the hill that is coming up.",1330041600,,645,4.103174603174603

I am a 66 year old criminal defense attorney and Law Professor in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Though we don't have any mountains (and only a few hills) we do have some impressive-for-the-area Rails to Trails pathways, but lousy weather winters. However, I have a son who has a mountain guide ,skiing, climbing business in Durango, Colorado (Klingmountainguides.com) whom I try to visit at least a couple of time /year. His wife is the HR person at Durango Purgatory Ski Resort. Of passing interest is that when my son Josh, now 30, was 15 he and a group of kids biked from Virginia to Los Angeles which is where we discovered Durango en route.

Through a number of trips to Durango and surrounding areas I began looking on line for biking videos in the region and found you folks. The rest is history. I have either purchased or been given as presents ""Indian to Girdwood,"" ""Evergreen to Red Rocks,"" ""E Rock Rocks,"" ""Training to Climb, Rattlesnake Bite,"" ""Laying Down the Hammer,"" ""Training to Endure, Front Range...."" and ""Bay Area Backroads."" I assure you my orders for the rest of your Colorado and the High Country videos are only a paycheck away.

I hold you completely responsible for my significant diversion from work and family, spending extra money for the videos, not to mention phenomenally better emotional and physical health and outlook and enjoyment of life in an otherwise flat topographically boring environment.

My Heath level is that I am trying to loose 30 lbs, not excessive for my height, but it is time.  It was easy to break this workout into two parts, each an excellent 55 minutes ride.  The whole ride has TWO biggest hills, the second with a couple more push than the first one.  Although there are no warmups and warm downs, the start and end of the ride has a pace that is just as good as any warm up in a spin class.  (I am not a cyclist and love spinning as a way of low impact exercise).  The last 15 minutes have some great speed work and interval equivalents, plus rolling hills.  there are also mini breaks where for the spinners you spin with little resistance.  It is really up to you to put more effort if you want to.  Although a recovery workout for true cyclists, for spinners, don't be fooled, just a great workout DVD for beginners or for advanced trainers.  The time went really quickly, but wished it was not filmed with so little natural light!

I definitely felt I got a great work out  even by breaking out the DVD into 2 parts.  The trainer did not talk excessively and there were real encouragements, advice to keep you going.  The dash board is pretty good with %heart rate, perceived effort (1 to 10 for spinners), RPM, and maps and elevations.  I have another Alaska DVD to try and hope there is more light!",1325289600,3,1552,4.171717171717172

Random rambling from the narrator's cycling partners even when you select music only is just one problem. You could be riding along any trail in any state and see the same paved bike path with trees covering most of the supposed awesome scenery. If you are looking to get a real work out on your indoor bike or spin bike, go with Mindy. she is motivating, and you will get a tough aerobic workout.
The New Age music was annoying.",1323648000,7,556,4.514851485148514
4013961,5,B002YWKNMW,"This video is good because the scenery is great, along worth the other features discussed, all help cut the boredom of riding on a trainer when the weather isn't so great. The best feature is the on screen telemetry that displays heart rate, cadence, gearing, gps location, speed, distance, elevation, and profile. If you have a heart rate monitor, and cadence sensor for your bike, you can really get a good feel for the type of ride that you are on. I like to dim the lights, and use a little imagination, and I am in Alaska.

The bits of info about Alaska and that black bear added to the experience.  ""Basement"" riding just got a whole lot better.",1318896000,,420,4.873239436619718
4013964,5,B002YWKNMW,"Of the Alaska Collection, this was my favorite ride. Though the lighting was a little grey, the views of the Chugach Mountains more than made up for it. Riding on the bike path for the whole ride was a fun experience. It is amazing that almost 2 hours flys by so quickly when you are engaged in the ride. Usually I can't stand more than 45 minutes on the trainer, but this totally changes that. Great ride!",1318896000,,406,4.285714285714286
8384435,3,B002YWKNMW,"So far i've only watched this video one time; I liked the scenery but felt there were too many on screen items. Specifically, my spin bike doesn't have gears so having a visual indicator showing which gear he is in doesn't help me. And I found the noise of his gears changes to be bothersome. Also, I don't see a way to turn off the talking without loosing the music. I don't feel like I would want to hear him talking to his guests and having question asked/answered every time I watch this. I will ride with it again in the next week, to see if my opinion changes.",1437004800,2,566,4.201834862385321

8384437,5,B002YWKNMW,This is my first virtual biking workout DVD. I'm very impressed. So much better than Spinning DVDs where the entire workout is in a tiny room. Now this will motivate me to get some exercise this winter! Looking forward to the next ride. Well done.,1416873600,,247,4.511111111111111
8384438,3,B002YWKNMW,"Could have been better (refer 'Virtual Active' DVDs for comparison).  However, there is beautiful scenery, three options for sound (music/narrative/en-route sounds) and stability of the camera is good ... BUT, I wish there was the option to hide the dashboard/flyover-screen or to reduce it's size to a less obstructive diagram.  Also, it appears there is some sort of protective transparent shield in front of the camera lens, which vibrates and produces some ghosting and flare on the image and reduces its quality in certain instances.  I would have preferred the music only option to be without the constant talking of the cyclists .. just music.",1409616000,,650,5.171428571428572
8384439,1,B002YWKNMW,"1 star = I hate it and I really did! I have used other DVD's for spinning and they are hard pumping rides with riders that look like athletes... This ride was with a bunch of women with a goofy grouname. It was leisurely. With lots of stops. I think it was meant as a calorie burner for heavy women who are not used to working out.
The guide at the bottom is confusing and big and does not coorespond to the narrators changes. And speaking of narration! it SUCKS. The guy sounds like he's on his couch and it CLICKING non stop (to try to change something like a gear or something but it is just click, click, click, click. - that in itself drove me crazy. I played as much as I could stand to see if it would actually turn into something else and it never did. I even fast forwarded. Then I couldn't rip the thing out of my DVD player fast enough. Ruined the whole first part of my ride.!  Just awful.",1405900800,,901,4.090395480225989
