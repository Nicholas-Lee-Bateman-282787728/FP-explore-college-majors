4042224,5,B002ZTLVYI,"It is hard to believe that a show like My Three Sons spanned the 1960s and early 1970s, but it did, and here is another chapter in this underrated show's history.

Season 2 sees the Douglas family much like they left off in season 1--pretty much all over the place, doing their own thing, but sort of an organized chaos type of situation.

The writing is very understated, while the acting is often over the top.

But I miss shows like this, and I certainly yearn for the next edition of this wonderful series on DVD.",1272412800,3,517,4.364583333333333
4042225,3,B002ZTLVYI,"The substituted new music -- apparently because CBS was too cheap to pay for the performance rights of the original, outstanding music score -- comes close to ruining this series.  If you think back to when you saw the show originally, you'll probably remember the whimsical, melodic music that was so prominently featured.  That's not what you get here.  Instead, CBS has put in synthesized music of recent vintage.  I can tell that the musicians who composed the new music were trying hard to get a sound similar to what was originally in the show, but they just can't do it.  Their melodies, while OK, just don't rise to the same heights as those originals, and when the very obvious synthesizer is used in place of a real orchestra, who do they think they're fooling?!?  My Three Sons was from the early 60s, when real orchestral scores were used, not synthesizers.

I'm sorry not to be able to give this DVD set 5 stars, because the remaining content of the shows is truly outstanding.  Fred MacMurray, William Frawley, and the sons -- Tim Considine, Don Grady, and Stanley Livingston -- play their parts with both feeling and humor.  The writing is some of the best, most creative (and hilarious) that you'll find anywhere in the history of TV.

It's really a shame that, for economic reasons, CBS chose to mar this fine show with synthesized music.  I don't blame the people who refuse to buy it.  (Then there's the matter of CBS breaking up the seasons into 2 separate sets, both sold at full price...)

CBS, how about doing a bit better the next time around?",1270512000,38,1567,4.634057971014493
4042226,5,B002ZTLVYI,I have always loved MTS. I have some of the later seasons on tape from TV reruns but these classic B&W are great.  I don't notice the so called cheesy music. The story line is still the same.,1268006400,4,191,4.026315789473684
4042227,5,B002ZTLVYI,"Growing up in Atlanta, I watched ""My Three Sons"" rerun on TBS over and over and over again. But they only had the color shows. So, I'd never even seen these old black and white episodes before. It's been great finally getting to see Mike and Bub. What a great classic. A show with a father that knew best (as opposed to the clueless dads they have on TV today.) They just don't make them like this anymore.",1267574400,7,406,4.217948717948718

4042233,2,B002ZTLVYI,"well of course the sitcom MY THREE SONS is a good alternative to todays garbage. however, if this is going to be another volume of edited and altered nonsense then no thank you. after all the complaints of the season one debacle, CBS/Paramount didn't even consider correcting it. the season one dvd's were atrocious with editing and new music. it will be really exciting to see what the fine folks at  cbs/paramount have in store for us this time. maybe colorizing the b&w second season? maybe giving us rinky-dink piano music as though we were watching a silent movie this time? how about robin williams as the voice of bub? oh theres no end to what those masterminds at CBS can come up with to teach us a lesson about spending our hard-earned money.......",1260835200,29,757,4.649253731343284

Can't find season 3 and beyond anywhere.  It's a shame because this family's dynamics changed over the years.

4042255,5,B002ZTLVYI,"There's comfort food and then there's comfort programming.  This tv series was a favorite of mine growing up, especially with the original cast.  If you grew up in the 60's, this show will take you back to some of the refreshing places we knew.  The characters dress like Beaver & Wally; and the grandpa manages to put food on the table without granite countertops and an island. The personalities and ages of the characters are appealing to a wide audience.  This series would make a good family time discussion with school age children and teens.  Win or lose, we don't have to take ourselves too seriously.  There is redemption here for kids and adults.  Costumes may change, but examining the relationships in the midst of everyday life are excellent learning.",1474156800,2,764,4.8307692307692305

4042332,4,B002ZTLVYI,"I loved this show as a kid, and it looks great for black and white tv. CBS video has always done a great job bringing their classic tv shows to DVD compared to the other companies (go back and check out the original  Mission Impossible and Hawaii 5-0 box sets, they look better than most of the shows put out today). Warner Bros comes in a close second but FOX DVD sucks! What they've done with the MTM catalog should be grounds for a murder indictment! Come on guys, if you're not going to release more seasons of St Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and Bob Newhart then let a third party like Shout or Image have access to them!
My only problem with all of the studios is taking forever to release follow up seasons on many of their shows and charging way too much for them!  Don't split them up into half seasons! If $39.99 is good enough for new full season one hour shows being released today, it should be enough for something that's been sitting in your vaults for decades! The price for comedies shouldn't exceed $29.99 for a full season either!",1358985600,,1049,4.374358974358974

I was a little surprised; when I was young the episodes I watched were with Uncle Ernie.  I enjoyed seeing the series from the begining. (We started with Season 1, Vol 2)",1347840000,,334,4.706896551724138
4042345,5,B002ZTLVYI,Arrived in a timely manner.  Was given as a Christmas Present. The person who received this present liked it.  There was nothing wrong with this dvd.,1331510400,,149,4.6923076923076925
4042346,5,B002ZTLVYI,"Love this show and purchase was fast, easy and problem free. I just wished they had more than two seasons available. Great experience.",1325635200,,134,4.869565217391305
4042347,5,B002ZTLVYI,"I love this show! As a child of the 70s, I grew up watching the color episodes in syndication, so catching the old black & white episodes with Mike and Bub is a delight. My favorite on this set is Coincidence - it's Bryant Park meets the Twilight Zone.

But, where are seasons 3, 4, 5, etc?  They need to be released!  What's not to love?  Steve, the consummate dad; Bub - then Uncle Charlie - the crusty, softhearted caretaker; Mike, Robbie (gee, I wasn't the only little girl with a major crush on him!!); Chip and Ernie (the Livingston Brothers.. HOORAY!) and of course, Tramp!!  Memories - Chip's friend Sudsy, Ernie's adoption, the move to California from Bryant Park, Mike & Sally's engagement, Robbie's band the Greefs, the Wongs, Ernie meets Zsa Zsa, Katie & the Triplets, Barbara & Dodie, even Fred MacMurray's double trouble role as Cousin Ferguson, bring 'em on!!

It's refreshing to watch a show that takes you back to a gentler time.  Escapism at its finest and I LOVE IT.

4042348,2,B002ZTLVYI,"I ordered My Three Sons (Season 2, Vol. 2 and i was not happy. The DVD's were fine. However, The DVD CASE was broken-up...and the company did not want to replace the DVD CASE.",1317859200,5,175,4.176470588235294
4042349,4,B002ZTLVYI,"While I don't like the split season concept, my bigger concern is wasting money to buy the first two seasons and then never having the rest of the seasons released. I have been burned a bunch of times already: Party of Five, Charlie's Angels, Sliders, All in the Family, Bob Newhart, Knots Landing, Family Ties, George Lopez, Happy Days, The Virginian. I have noted countless others have done this since I wised up and decided to wait until all were out before taking the plunge. I know they think that they can gauge our interest by looking at sales numbers. However, they don't realize that shoddy practices of releasing only a few seasons and then not releasing later seasons is hurting their initial sales. Sony Entertainment is the absolute worst about this and has hurt sales for all series.",1295222400,8,797,4.741007194244604
4042350,5,B002ZTLVYI,How great to see these old shows again!  Watched this show when I was a little girl so this brings back memories.  A fun set to add to your collection.,1290470400,5,151,4.0
4042351,1,B002ZTLVYI,"Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.",1288224000,33,440,4.313253012048193
4042352,4,B002ZTLVYI,"Wow, releases of shows like MY THREE SONS make me so happy because I get to see the fine character actors of the golden age of television.  In this set, the stalwart performers who add so much sitcom spice include Billy Barty, Mary Jackson, the incomparable Reta Shaw, and the versatile Verna Felton (in one of her very final sitcom roles).  I was especially happy with this particular set's release, as the only copy I had of Miss Felton's episode ""COINCIDENCE"" was a bootleg.  She shines, although briefly, in this guest spot.  Fred MacMurray is awesome as Steve Douglas, and the boys are all charming in their characterizations, just as pleasing as William Frawley is grumpy as ""Bub.""  Very happy this has been released, but like so many others, I dislike the two volumes per season.",1287014400,5,786,4.75
4042373,5,B002ZTLVYI,"My family and I enjoy watching My Three Sons together.  It is a great family show, and for my younger children they can see and learn how things were when we were kids by watching this show.  very happ with the dvd looking forward to the release of the next seasons.",1286236800,,266,4.196078431372549

4042375,5,B002ZTLVYI,"I love this show, I would have to say that the Best Actor is Fred MacMurray, BUB is good, but the one that I really like is Uncle Charlie.  I recommend this show to anyone that really likes Good CLEAN Comedy.",1285804800,,208,4.073170731707317
4042376,5,B002ZTLVYI,"I love this show.  I wished they would come out with the rest of the series, but I wished that they would all be one complete series, instead of volume one and volume 2",1285372800,,168,3.9411764705882355

4042378,5,B002ZTLVYI,"I grew up with My Three Sons (the ones in color during my time) but when TV Land lived up to their true motto of playing tv classics, that is when I was introduced to the B&W versions like this dvd, as well as other classic shows (Donna Reed Show, Patty Duke Show, Father Knows Best, etc.)  I do wish like the other viewers, that they just released the whole season in one set, instead of splitting it up into two volumes each season, but if that's the price my family plays to have wholesome fun entertainment, then so be it.  My three young boys (no pun intended) thoroughly enjoy watching this with me.  My boys are ages 12, 11, and 9 and we totally make it a special time together.  Thanks for releasing this and hopefully more of the classics will follow!",1279670400,13,760,4.293706293706293

4042380,1,B002ZTLVYI,"The show of course is great, and I'll buy the whole series after the rip off's had its go around. As always, when a DVD producer cheats enough customers with over priced DVD sets split into partial seasons like this, they release the entire series at a much lower price.

4042381,1,B002ZTLVYI,"I loved this show during its years on television.  I will not, however, put my hard-earned money down for a half season at a time.  This kind of greed is inexcusable.  A boycott will not work if some people are gonna pay for them the way they're being sold.  I have a feeling that it's not selling as well as the sellers had hoped.

I can do without Katie, Charlie a little bit, when the boys all moved away, Chip becoming obnoxious a wee bit and bringing in Ernie to youth up the show. The show had a very long run.
