5049098,5,B00720ONHM,"This film really moved me.  There were at least a few times I actually got goosebumps because the movie hit so close to home. (no pun intended... HA!) I would highly recommend this film to families with children or Parents who desire to have deep discussions with their children on the themes of this film.
Buy It!  Help Support Quality Christian films!  We need more movies that are not preachy but have a solid Christ Centered message!",1331164800,,437,4.64935064935065

5049112,2,B00720ONHM,"A slow moving film, with background music often too loud, to the point it sometimes was difficult to hear the dialogue.
Last half of the film was better, but I had to fast forward the slow parts in the first half to get through the movie.
Enjoyed the comments about God and our need for His help.
Overall, don't recommend buying the film.",1380672000,,338,4.380952380952381
5049113,3,B00720ONHM,While the movie certainly had a good story line and we felt the acting was not believable and it just didn't have quite the punch we were hoping for.,1379980800,,149,4.172413793103448

5049121,5,B00720ONHM,"I'm not saying that it is the first, I don't know that for sure. But here is the best sports movie of 2012. This movie is filled with hope and inspiration. Most deffinately a movie parents can feel comfortable showing to their younger children. It is one of the best baseball movies I've seen in many years. And it has a message everyone will agree with.",1355616000,3,354,4.378787878787879
5049122,5,B00720ONHM,We are always looking for positive family movies with a message. This was great. My kids are in sports and we love the positive message that good sports can bring. You don't have to be the star athlete to do well. You need God and a good attitude. I have seen bad attitudes bring many people down.,1344124800,2,297,4.228070175438597
5049123,2,B00720ONHM,"I didn't give this movie 1 star, abysmal, because it's Christian and has a good message. You have to give it some credit for that, right? However, it only gets 2 stars from me, not worth it, because it really isn't even with the message.
First of all, just realize this is NOT a good movie for the whole family. A because of some mature content, and B because anyone under 12 (or over if not sufficiently mature) would be bored out of their skulls. There's not a huge amount of actual baseball, so definitely don't get it because of that.
Second, the acting is horrific. I do some acting myself, and I can really appreciate good acting. This is by far the worst I've ever seen in any movie. Home videos I've viewed are better. You can't go 5 seconds without thinking wow, what terrible acting. Also, it's funny, but many of the producers, the directors, etc. also star in the movie. Additionally, multiple of them have the same last names. Huh...
It's not a TOTAL waste. Like I said, there's a great message. But just know there is bad acting, my family has a joke ""they look at pictures in every other scene"" and it is for sure not either a whole family type of movie nor really a baseball movie. JTLYK. [Just to let you know]",1338422400,5,1227,4.362445414847161
5049124,1,B00720ONHM,"I bought this movie because of all of the positive reviews. At the time,there were many who gave this movie 5 stars and a few who gave it 1 star. I would love to give this movie a positive review but with a clear conscience I cannot. Of course it is a good movie compared to all the trash out there. If you are comparing it to other Christian movies we have seen, it is very disappointing. Poor acting, disjointed storyline, and very uninspiring to my family. Maybe others enjoyed it but we did not. My wife and daughter thought it was terrible. She is giving it to Goodwill. I want to support Christian movies but I feel like this was a total waste of money. Of course, this is only our opinion. I respect others opinions who like this movie too.",1335657600,18,747,4.267605633802817
5049125,1,B00720ONHM,"After reading the reviews I purchased this movie thinking it would be a good Christian film to watch as a family. After viewing maybe half the film, I had to turn it off because of the immodesty & inappropriate scenes. The Christian film community can do far better than this.",1335571200,16,276,4.54
5049126,1,B00720ONHM,"I got this movie based on the positive reviews here, but they seem to be
from friends and family of either the actors, or others affiliated, or
flat out paid reviewers.

This was as low budget movie as you can possibly imagine, looks like
somebody with a videocam they bought on Amazon rounded up their friends
and called them actors.  I have seen better acting in high school plays.

Film quality was poor, the story was boring, exaggerated and
not believable due to the bad acting.  They jump from seeing the main
character as a little boy getting a terribly scripted speach from his Dad,
to suddenly an injured pro who is angry at the world and turns into a drunk.
No character development whatsoever.  This is at best public access cable quality.

Before you decide I am an outlier and unkind, my 13 yo son and I have watched every movie
we could find on baseball topics.  He is a fanatic at both playing, watching and
even umpires games !  He and I both agreed to turn this movie off 1/2 way through.
We have never considered stopping any movie 1/2 way, especially not baseball related.
And I do not have negative reviews in general posted, but if I save one person from
buying this piece of junk, it was time better spent posting this instead of watching
the rest of the movie. I am not the least concerned we missed a great ending.
Was not worth the wait even if so.",1334448000,8,1373,4.399209486166008
5049127,1,B00720ONHM,"I have no quarrel with people's personal beliefs - enough wars have been waged with religion at the center of the conflict as justification for outright murder ... but sliding a religious agenda in beneath the guise of entertainment is offensive to me.  I personally feel that if we rate movies G, PG, R, X and so on, why not add a new category for religion?  You could have CH for Christian, CA for Catholic, HI for Hindu, MU for Muslim... and so on!  Everybody wins!  Now you can rent the movie that matches your own religious beliefs instead of being surprised as the wolf removes a layer of clothing scene-by-scene!  Yes, God is entitled to product placement as much as the Tobacco lobby is, I only ask that such tactics be identified within the movie synopsis.",1334361600,2,765,4.554744525547445
5049128,1,B00720ONHM,Ok ill be short and sweet with this. Im a big fan of the whole christian movie movement over the past few years but i can honestly say this movie was a miss. The story and plot were right on but the acting was by far the worst I have ever scene. I mean seriously who casted this film. Ok lets not put all the blame on that person and realize that its the director that has the overall decision. Bad Mr. Director. BAD!!!!!,1333929600,6,421,4.023809523809524

5049130,5,B00720ONHM,"This movement is soaring and One Hit From Home is yet another trophy God can put on display for His glory. What I like a lot about this one is the struggles by the characters are not sugar coated. They're real and portrayed as real to a tasteful point. The acting is well done and the storyline is solid.
God is continuing to raise up a media army that leaves us with more options other than Hollywod. And the makers of OHFH are right on the front lines.",1331942400,6,454,4.170454545454546
5049131,5,B00720ONHM,"While ""One Hit from Home"" could be described as a coming of age movie wrapped in the drama of athletic competition, it was really much more than that. The film takes you on a journey of self discovery. It's a story of facing your past, succeeding in the face of adversity and using your own struggles to help others and empower your future. The faith based messages and themes are nicely woven throughout the film without being overly ""preachy."" And, the cast is pretty easy on the eyes ;)",1331596800,2,489,4.50561797752809
