not a bad movie, and worthwhile to watch once , so you would be better off getting it with netflix.  BTW it is nothing like the
exciting cover.",1503619200,,275,3.981818181818182
8032725,4,B0002V7SV6,"I only paid about 4 dollars for this on Amazon. It was worth 4 dollars. I don't mean that as a slight either.  It's actually a pretty fun Argentinian vampire movie. I didn't know they existed. Actually, seems like Argentina at one point had a pretty wild movie seen between stuff like this and Isabel Sarli movies. They liked their sexy peril films in the land of nazi sympathies.

The main reason to watch this movie is the sets and costumes. People look like Scooby Doo meets a Hammer film in Argentina. It's an interesting visual dissonance. Thankfully, the movie is short too and you never slow down long enough to think about the stupidity of a European castle somewhere in Argentina.",1469664000,,689,4.639344262295082

8032727,3,B0002V7SV6,"There are certainly some bad movies made out there, a large number of which were made in the sixties and specifically in European countries. This is not to say that the U.S. made the best pictures without their own share of turkeys. Indeed, the bad movie is not limited to any one country. At the same time some of those bad movies weren't as bad during the time period they were released. Viewed now though it takes some stamina to get through one.

That being said, there is a market for many of these movies. Collectors are fascinated by the films of directors who were more noted for infamy than for a celebration of art. And yet on occasion those same directors actually did create some artistic films. The names Jess Franco and Paul Naschy come to mind. As fans are drawn to their films they begin to discover other directors from Europe as well and clamor to pick up everything they can. This has opened a market for those films, one that companies like Cheezy Flicks has tapped into.

The company has found that there is money to be made in repackaging and in some cases putting out for the first time various movies that their original studios have decided to ignore or films that have a niche market that they are willing to tap. The great thing about this is that movies once unavailable can now be found for a reasonable price. The only problem is that videophiles will gripe about the lack of extras, something I've never let stop me from picking up a movie I was looking for. All this being said, Cheezy Flicks has just released another European horror flick in their series called Erotomania. The movie is BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS, and actually it's not all that bad though quite dated. While not really a European film (it was made in Argentina) it does feature those sensibilities.

The movie opens around the turn of the century somewhere in Spain. Ofelia is in love with Gustavo but is being forced to marry Eduardo at her parent's insistence. Gustavo swears that he will not allow it to happen, that he will never let Ofelia go. Marrying for societal stature instead of love, she goes through with the wedding. On their wedding night, Gustavo shows up as they are about to consummate their wedding, kills Eduardo and turns Ofelia into a vampire. Yes, Gustavo was a vampire, the reason he refused to meet her family.

Fast forward to the swinging sixties (the movie was made in 1967). Three young couples and their goofy guide are on a tour of the country, going from nightclubs to ski slopes and more. Call me surprised to find that it was nothing for dating couples to undress at the local club while dancing. As they travel from one town to the next one night, they discover they've run out of gas. Too far to walk to the next town and too late to flag down a passing car, they walk to an abandoned lodge to spend the night ignoring the guide's tale that the place is haunted. Of course this is the same lodge where our earlier story took place.

They start a fire, find food left out for them on a table and after drinking drugged wine, all fall asleep with the exception of one of the men. While searching through the home he comes across Ofelia who jumps into the sack with. The next morning the girls are nowhere to be found and the police are alerted. Eventually they begin showing up but each one is pale and ill, suffering from an unknown malady. As the young man begins to look into the lore of the place with the help of his girlfriend's brother, they find out about the story of Gustav and Ofelia. But will it be in time to save everyone?

The story seems pretty standard by horror film fare with few changes in vampire folklore to be seen. Most notable is that these vampires seem to be able to walk in daylight but then again perhaps that was a budgetary choice rather than one for folklore. The photography seems to be standard European sixties style with little flare but not all that bad. The transfer is acceptable so don't worry that this is just a VHS to DVD transfer. The movie hasn't been given a refurbishing as many blu-ray films are these days, but it's fine anyway.

As with any foreign film that comes this way there is possibly a few things lost in translation. That's something that can't be avoided and for the most part doesn't affect the story being told. The same holds true for the acting which seems fine but since you're reading the dialogue rather than hearing the words actually spoken, it loses something. Still, the cast seems to do a decent job of it all. Then again you can tell that their acting skills weren't always what the film maker here was going for. Susana Beltran as Ofelia seems hired more for her physical presence than for her acting ability. Again, though, not knowing the language on it's own you won't know for sure.

On the whole this is not the worst European styled vampire movie to enter the U.S. but not the best either. For fans looking to fill out there collection it's worth adding. If you love European horror then you'll want to pick it up. Also fans of director Emilio Vieyra, the man behind THE CURIOUS DR. HUMP and NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES, will want to add it to your collection as well.",1405382400,2,5175,4.4630021141649046
8032728,4,B0002V7SV6,"If you like cheesy B movies like me, then youll love BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS.  This vintage import is Argentinas very first vampire film, and it shows!  The fine folks at Cheezy Flicks have procured a true winner with this film, as it contains all of the aspects that define B movies:  bad acting, a mess of a plot, and terrible special effects.  But this is one of those films that is so bad, its good.  Thus, its a perfect way to spend an hour of your time!

Its been a while since Ive seen a truly cheesy flick, so I was definitely due.  And this is the perfect film to get back in the swing of things!  Chocked full of schlocky goodness, this is one of those films you will love to pick apart.

BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS is not made very well and doesnt really look that good onscreen.  The cinematography is so-so, and the locations used for the film don't make a lot of sense.  For example, the 19th century house looks more like a modern day suburban beach house.  I understand budget constraints, but the crew could have put a bit more effort into their location search.  Thats part of what makes the film fun, thoughtheres plenty to roll your eyes at here.

The title might be a bit off, too.  The girls in the film are NOT virgins, which is pretty evident with the way they act early on; at one point, the girls are dancing with their guys in a barand then proceed to strip as they boogie.  Yup, they take their clothes off, even with other patrons there.  Would a virginal person do something like that?  I don't think so.

The vampire effects are painful to endure.  The fangs look like they are made out of paper, and the eye makeup is ridiculous.  Add these attributes to the fact that they wear typical old-school Count Dracula style clothes, and you can definitely see TRUE BLOOD is a far cry from these folks.

But for all of its faults, BLOOD OF THE VIRGINS is so much fun.  Its just too bad not to like!  If you take the film for what it is, then youll love it.  But don't expect too much or you will be disappointed.  I recommend this one to anyone looking for vintage, schlocky fun.  It is available now.",1403136000,,2117,4.2537688442211055
8032729,4,B0002V7SV6,"Colorful sexual romp as van load of ""hippie"" types gets stranded on the way-far side of England, this being a Hammer clone with an unmistakable flare for South American attributes. You've got bare breasted lasses here, lots of inane plotting and cornball dialogue and situations. The opening comes off as some sort of travelogue of Argentinian tourism...and then we get down to the meat and potatoes of it all...VAMPIRISM!!!
Weird, meaningless romp into nudity and the undead. Must be seen to be believed. I liked it, especially all those scenes of seagulls flying about endlessly, subbing in for vampire bats, I think. Weird again, especially in that Argentina, before worldwide cable broadcasting, cell phones and whatnot, can capture so perfectly the look and feel of the swinging sixties, go-go clubs and Hammer sensibilities, so much so that some sources even list Christopher Lee as starring in this film. He does not.
Whatever.., you're getting a great transfer onto dvd, a sharp picture with lush color. So if you're into a little south of the border mayhem and don't mind topless babes in ravishing Technicolor then I can recommend this travesty for you at all costs. High enjoyment factor, quite unlike any other vampire film you'll see any time soon.",1390694400,4,1261,5.038277511961723
8032730,2,B0002V7SV6,"I bought this movie for two things: vampires & Mondo Macabro. The cover looked pretty cool too, but after watching it I came to the sad conclusion that this movie sucked.  I have seen a few of these Mondo Macabro movies and so far I have only liked a small handfull; so pick wisely my friends, or you will end up with a bunch of laim DVD's and a smaller bank account, because this things are not cheap.",1364169600,6,402,4.153846153846154
8032731,4,B0002V7SV6,"First off, let's clear up the misinfo in the details listed for this product - Chris Lee is NOT in this flick. It's not a Hammer, Amicus or Jess Franco film; it's a hammeresque vampire tale made in 1967 in Argentina, but has many, if not all, of the trappings of a gothic Eurohorror offering from this era.  From the director who gave us the infamous and delirious 'The Curious Dr. Humpp' and the impossible to find 'Feast of Flesh', Emilio Vieyra  manages to deliver the template of what was to become the rudimentary plotline for 80% of all Eurohorror as well as US and UK horror entries during the 70's. It goes something like this -
A group of swinging hippies are vacationing in the woods/mountains, and one night their van breaks down and they seek shelter in an old abandoned lodge/castle/haunted house, and it becomes a night they will never forget, assuming they survive, that is. This plot has been around since James Whale's 'The Old Dark House' in 1931 through every episode of 'Scooby-doo'... Originality aside, it still works remarkably well, assuming it's done right. And has the required nudity, if I'm not mistaken. And this one has it all - buoyantly bare-breasted babes, topless go-go dancing, group-groping and dry-humping on dance club bar table tops, this is one helluva hot Latin ride through south-of-the-border sixties cinema and, oh yeah, it's got a pretty cool vampire story to go with all the lurid, lascivious proceedings. This one's not to be missed, kids, it's sexy psych-cinema awash in colorful confusion and more interesting than anything Hammer films was releasing at that time. I'm a bit baffled at the scenes of seagulls saturated with red background implying that they're bats - this is South America, you couldn't find a few real bats? Then resort to the old hokey Hammer trick and use plastic ones on easy-to-see strings and ramp up the camp value... the more experienced viewers out there have already hit the sauce or pipe prior to the credits anyway...

Mondo Macabro also treats us to a fine documentary on Argentinian exploitation (I'm betting you didn't know such a thing existed), production notes, a stills gallery, a great transfer and trailers - God love 'em.",1303257600,4,2209,4.8541114058355435
8032732,4,B0002V7SV6,"Argentinean movie director Emilio Vieyra immediately fires up his 1967 horror/sex send up Blood of the Virgins with the acute notion that most have given the legend of vampirism at least a cursory glance. Very little dramatic build up leads to even less character development, and then we're out of the gates and plowing down the home stretch.  Amenities and blouses be gone! We only have 77 minutes to settle this sucker!  Bring on the bare breasts and blood!  And that's precisely what Vieyra does.

In short, a group of swingers are touring the vamp's area when their hippie van collapses, leaving them to spend an unforgettable and seemingly unlivable evening at the Count's lodge.  The Count has kept an unwilling yet equally undead bride in his clutches, and not surprisingly, a sing-song ""vampire"" romp ensues.  However, at least Emilio Vieyra was at the helm to save us from that tired fodder as boobies quickly begin to flow from the females' brasiers as fluently as blood from their fang-punctured wounds.

Thematically there is an interesting twist as the Count's vamped bride not only exterminates her captor with the dreaded silver dagger but then turns the damnable instrument upon herself.  Cinematically we're treated to numerous topless Go-Go dancers who wiggle wildly to cool-school jazz while inserts of sea gulls double for vampire bats. Weird.

Emilio Vieyra is Argentina's answer to Brazil's Coffin Joe, Spain's Jesus Franco and France's Jean Rollin.  Vieyra haphazardly stumbled upon the horror/sex combo and immediately submitted three very bizarre entries into the cycle.  In fact all three were released between 1967 and 1970.  Vieyra's genre credits include; The Deadly Organ (a.k.a.: Feast of Flesh), the mind/crotch-blowing Curious Dr. Hummp and of course Blood of the Virgins.

This DVD from Mondo Macabro features a fantastic documentary on Argentinian exploitation film making as well as production notes, a still gallery and alternate subtitles.
