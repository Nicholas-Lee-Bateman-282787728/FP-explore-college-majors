4482709,5,B004VK74UE,"This is a completely enjoyable through Neil's songbook by a bunch of extremely talented artists. Both Dave Matthews and Ben Harper show what great musicians they are by largely solo acoustic performances, Keith Urban shows off his lead guitar chops (in tandem with no less a legend than John Fogerty of CCR), and CSN show that they can still harmonize beautifully. Performances by Norah Jones, Lady Antebellum, and Jason Mraz/Shawn Colvin show of the often ignored sweeter side of Neil. And Wilco's on-stage replication of the very complex studio creation Broken Arrow is just amazing.

Does Neil do all these songs better? Of course! Any major talent, from Dylan and the Beatles on down always does their own material best. But these are still very enjoyable versions that give one a different take on Neil's artistry.",1307318400,40,819,5.022058823529412
4482710,1,B004VK74UE,"Not much to say... watched it on Palladium.... had trouble staying awake. Boring and dull covers.  Cant say anything about the blu-ray quality since I watched it on tv. Im a big fan of concert dvd's, but won't waste money on a disc that I hope to never have to see again.",1307232000,8,271,4.211538461538462
4482711,2,B004VK74UE,"No one sings Neil Young like Neil Young and this tribute concert proves it. The only credible performances were John Fogerty singing ""Rockin' In The Free World"" and are you ready Josh Groban doing ""Harvest Moon"".

The rest were pretty amateur especially in front of Neil and his friends. He deserved the honor, not the music.",1307145600,7,325,4.803571428571429
4482712,1,B004VK74UE,"It was clear to me after the first song I was watching the work of an incompetent director or maybe no director at all. Some performances are great, Wilco rises to a difficult challenge on ""Broken Arrow"", and others seem to be doing their best with mixed results, but the production is stripped of any sense of the event. I suppose this was constructed as a product to sell to TV and the thinking was, ""We've got big big names, let's cut and paste one of each without even bothering to mention the lesser known support players and see who will take the bait. It's a shame. I'm sure there was a lot of worthwhile performances left out for the sake of convenience. Disappointing is putting it mildly.
ps Watching  virtuoso guitarist Dave Mathews feign compassion on ""The Needle And The Damage Done"" was a comical high point.",1307145600,9,822,4.554054054054054
4482713,5,B004VK74UE,"I'm sorry but, the other reviews for this are absurd.  This is a TRIBUTE to one of the greatest songwriters of our times and all of the performers do excellent.  Regardless of whether or not you like each individual cover, it's the passion that these multiple musicians have for Mr. Young.  I was very touched when Dave Matthews sang ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" and, at the end, gave Neil Young a big thumbs up.  You could really see how much he cared.  In my opinion, all of the performances were spot on.  If I could give this 6 stars, I would.",1307059200,29,551,4.300970873786408
4482714,3,B004VK74UE,"Some highlights include , Broken Arrow by Wilco - tremendous job duplicating the original. Also like Mr. Soul under the bonus performances.
Rockin' In The Free World by Keith Urban & John Fogerty is also very good. That is about it for me .
 Many artists sound bored . It seems like they didn't put much effort in . Jackson Browne was alright , Lady Antebellem was good .
James Taylor's read of Heart of Gold was boring . I was really looking forward to that and was very dissapointed . I expected so much more from
this performance. Elton John and Leon Russell did ok with Helpless . Leon was sluggish early on in this song. John Mellencamp was ok with Down By the River.
His lead guitarist is excellent and could have stolen the song , if allowed . T Bone Burnett sat in on this and I wasn't really sure if added anything by
being there .
 I thought Elvis Costello was terrible . He sounded poor and performed with just an acoustic guitar . He really needed some help. Crosby , Stills & Nash were also
awful . I didn't like their read on Human Highway at all. Graham Nash seems to be a caricature of himself on stage . It's painful to watch him sing with his gyrations
and facial movements . He still sounds ok . Hopefully someone can squeeze out another good song or two from these guys somewhere down the road .
 Jason Mraz does ok with Shaun Colvin on Lotta' Love and Norah Jones is ok too .
I would like to know who the backing band was . They were excellent . I've watched the whole show twice and didn't see or hear any introductions of them . The woman that came
out to sing with Norah Jones was never introduced . I thought that was odd. Ben Harper introduced his singers and you barely get to hear their first names.
 Neil seemed genuinely touched to be honored. He was very humbled by the whole night .
After the first couple of performances , I really thought this was going to be great . Keith Urban was terrific with John Fogerty and followed nicely by Lady Antebellum . After that
the show just flattened out except for a few performances . Just could've , should've been better than this . I had my hopes up very high after looking at the artists and the songs
they were singing . It just seemed like a lot of good matches . It just didn't work out for me as I hoped. I would actually not buy the CD if one were to come out . I might cherry pick
a few songs off I-Tunes if the opportunity arises . I will look into music by Keith Urban . He also did well on the Stones' song Tumbling Dice on Jimmy Fallon and hopefully he has some
live covers available somewhere.
 If you still are interested in this , just buy it on sale . Not worth full price.",1306886400,18,2663,4.153100775193798
4482715,2,B004VK74UE,I just finished watching this on Palladia and was very disappointed.  I love Neil's music and anticipated a great show.  Instead you find yourself wanting to hear Neil sing these again as these cover artists are BLAH to say the least. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to own this.  I was glad to see that he was honered.,1306886400,12,321,4.316666666666666

Seeing other musical artists like John Mellencamp, Josh Groban,Ben Harper,James Taylor perform Neil's tunes was awesome. Being a musician myself, I especially like the backing band for the evening which includes one of my favorite drummers Kenny Aronoff.
All this is presented in a package for a good cause with a mission to help help troubled musicians.  Nice !",1392076800,,435,4.8

4482736,5,B004VK74UE,"This is a FABULOUS concert.  The various artists are great, and each Neil Young song has been paired beautifully to each artist.  Ben Harper doing ""Ohio"", Jackson Browne on ""Don't Let It Bring You Down"" and John Mellencamp with T Bone Burnett on ""Down By The River"" are extra special gems.  I watched it over and over on the Palladia channel til my husband finally bought it for me.  Truly a great concert video.",1375574400,,412,4.527027027027027
4482737,5,B004VK74UE,"Always liked Neil's music, not so much his politics.  This was a good tribute.  Especially liked josh groban' rendition of harvest moon.  Good powerful voice.",1372550400,,158,5.24
4482738,4,B004VK74UE,Saw NY live in Calgary and he put on a great show. To watch the MusiCares tribute was great. There are a couple of weak performances but overall it is a great DVD. Not as good as NY live but it is nice to see other artists' put their spin on his memorable music.,1365465600,,262,3.8703703703703702
4482739,5,B004VK74UE,Neil Young's Music is great and to hear the songs performed by other great musicians and personalities added to the enjoyment of this DVD. Only negative was that there should have been more views of Neil and his reaction to his songs as performed by others.,1356998400,,257,4.608695652173913

Product was exactly as described on webpage.",1355184000,,136,5.85
4482741,5,B004VK74UE,This was an amazing music video. All of his greatest songs performed by the very best of artists were presented with class and total perfection. I watched it over and over and then bought his Decades CD to listen to while I'm driving. It took me right back to my Hippie Days and all the great music that we had back then.,1349136000,,321,4.193548387096774
4482742,5,B004VK74UE,"Let me start by saying that there are only 2 reasons that I would ever give this 4 stars, instead of 5. 1)it was too short and 2)it's not available on CD. That being said, I just can't give it less than 5. I'm an old(er) broad who grew up listening to Neil Young's songs (a multitude of covers included) and I'm still listening to them. I've seen him (as well as several of the tribute artists) in concert, many times. If you want to rate this video on sound quality, etc. I can't argue with you because frankly, I'm no audiophile, but I am a lover of music and the artists who offered up their tributes to this amazing man, legend, icon, prolific songwriter, all did so beautifully and with heart. Yes, there were artists who weren't jumping all over the stage as they performed, but that has nothing to do with being bored or needing more rehearsal. (Well, OK... Crow and Case should have spent a bit more time in rehearsal) Artists all have their own methodolgy when it comes to performing and slow and steady is just one of those methods. The true gems for me are Dave Matthew's rendition of ""Needle And The Damage Done"", James Taylor's performance of ""Heart of Gold"", Elvis Costello's ""Losing End"" and the absolutely outstanding version of ""Broken Arrow"" by Wilco. Norah Jones, CSN, Jackson Browne and Mellencamp/Burnette knocked it out of the park too. If you're over 40 and love the music that you grew up listening to as much as I do, this is a must buy. If you're under 40 and truly appreciate the iconic talent of Neil Young, then do the same. You won't regret it.",1345766400,15,1574,4.449826989619377
4482743,4,B004VK74UE,"Wonderful music and concert. My favourite was Dave Matthews rendition of The Needle and the Damage Done. Not an easy note to sing and Dave did it amazingly. Elton John, Leon Russell and Sheryl Crowe did a great rendition of Helpless. Was a little disappointed in Jackson Browne and I'm not a big Josh Groban fan. Apart from that, it was a sterling effort. Would definitely recommend this to any Crosby Stiils Nash and Young fans. It was also great to see Stephen Stills, David Crosby and Graham Nash on the show.",1322524800,2,512,4.576086956521739
4482744,4,B004VK74UE,This DVD is generally good with a few of the artist's falling short of the mark on their renditions of Neil's great songs. There are many great versions as well...I am glad I bought this DVD.,1319760000,2,191,4.333333333333333
4482745,5,B004VK74UE,"Loved this so much when I saw it that I ordered it..and then ordered two more for friends.. If you love Neil Young..you will LOVE this...every song is done well from start to finish.  Keith Urban, John Fogerty and Booker T. Jones rock Rockin in the Free World and then next my HANDS DOWN favorite on this cd..Lady Antebellum singing Only Love Can Break Your Heart...and Nora Jones is amazing...Dave Matthews nails it..every single preformer just puts everything into each song...and Neil Young and his wife watching is awesome...just LOVE this dvd and watch it over and over..just wish I could get it on cd for my car...A wonderful job in honor of the most class act...",1318204800,10,669,4.717948717948718
4482746,4,B004VK74UE,"This was not as good as I had hoped, don't get me wrong but for those of us who have systems that sound quality is #1 I think the hd sound fell short. Also there could have been more thought into the bands selected,and why put 2 songs as bonus songs that should  have been in the performnance. All in all  it's perty good.",1315526400,,322,4.015625
4482747,4,B004VK74UE,"Yeah.  I was really surprised that all of these artists didn't sound exactly like Neil Young (sarcasm intended).  Other artists singing any legend's songs are going to be hit and miss.  There are a few performances that were just okay--like Dave Matthews, Dirks Bentley, and Elvis Costello--but then there are the very cool versions: among them, Josh Groban, who does an excellent ""Harvest Moon,"" Ben Harper, James Taylor, and Lady Antebellum.  I'm not really a fan of three of those four, but they brought something new to Neil's music without trying to sound exactly like him.  This highlights what a great songwriter Neil is.  If you like Neil Young and half of these performers, this is probably something you'll want to watch and maybe add to your collection.  If you are such a big Neil Young fan that every other talented musician that sings his songs will most certainly pale in comparison, even before you've seen this film, then you might want to steer clear.",1312761600,4,969,4.836363636363636
4482748,1,B004VK74UE,"I usually just rate audio/video quality on concert discs, but these performances require a special comment.  The audio presentation is above average with a broad soundstage, plenty of ""air"" between the instruments and solid well recorded bass.  There is palpable three dimensional body to the DTS 5.1 sound track.  Video is average for a live show.  Most of the performances are jam session or open mic at the bowling alley quality.  Some of these artists should hang it up or show up for rehersal.  The exceptions are WILCO doing an excellent note for note version of Buffalo Springfields ""Broken Arrow"" and CSN on ""Human Highway.""  I'm getting rid of this sucker immediately.",1311120000,2,677,4.991071428571429
4482749,2,B004VK74UE,"This DVD is just OK, you get some tidbits of songs but nothing substantial(in fact after watching it I sold it immediately on ebay).  If you're a Neil Young freak and need to have it then order it, if not there are others on the market that are a lot better.",1310947200,2,258,4.0588235294117645
4482750,5,B004VK74UE,"I started watching this concert on TV and ordered it on Amazon before it was even over. So many of my favorite artist singing Neil Young songs...what could be better? The awesome and unusual pairing of Keith Urban and John Fogerty was amazing with a little help from Booker T. Jones. One of my very very favs, Dave Matthews doing ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" was perfect. Also, Lady Antebellum, Norah Jones, Josh Groban, (yes folks, Josh doing Neil Young),Ben Harper, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, CSN, Elton & Leon...to say this is an all star line up is an understatement. The keyboard player in the background,who you can hardly see, but is playing on most of the songs, is Rami Jaffee from The Wallflowers(Jakob Dylans band)and Foo Fighters. He is great and highly underrated as a keyboard player. If you love Neil and any of these artists, this is a must have.",1309392000,18,902,4.751592356687898
4482751,1,B004VK74UE,"Young wrote the songs presented here and countless other gems that could have been used. Those were the lucky ones, for they were not predictably butchered by the assembled cast. Josh Grobin, please (just go away that is). The always coma inducing Nora Jones, Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin and Sheryl Crow. The progressively more annoying Elvis. The shockingly bad James Taylor and John Mellencamp.

Fogerty and Urban stood out and started off the event solidly. Sadly it was all down hill from there.

Don Was was listed as the musical director, so he must be to blame for this mess. Young certainly deserved much better than this for a tribute, at least we were spared another appearance by the more and more ubiquitous India Aire and Esperanza Spaulding at these ""events"".

This will appeal to so many people with good music taste that clearly deserve something better for their money, even if it is a fundraiser. This is such an uninspired show. You'd think from the lineup (and the man being honored) that Wilco wouldn't have been the only ones to put some thought and practice into their tribute. Broken Arrow is a three-run homer. The rest are strike-outs and weak grounders. Most are borderline boring. Sorry, but Neil Young deserves a better tribute and you deserve more for your $20...",1307404800,10,575,4.702970297029703
