This is a REAL STORY.. Read the book first to really know the FACTS.... Marc Schiller is a real person that went through this.
please after reading the  ""TRUE DETAILS"" Make comments on the movie..
You can get the true facts by ordering his book on Amazion.com .. I did and after reading it I was breathless and so was my entire family

The movie is a rude JOKE to what a real person went through..

5529726,5,B00AZKY0OW,"Pain & Gain is everything that I thought I wanted out of a bro-down action-comedy and then some.  There's muscles, lots and lots of muscles, weightlifting, knocking people the f@$# out, zany crime schemes, loads of hot girls in skimpy dresses and thong bikinis and sometimes nothing at all, dudes talking about getting ripped, humorous accidental murder, an idiot who thinks he's a mastermind, some middle-of-the-road comedic torture scenes (but nothing hard to watch), adult sex toys and the unavoidable humor that comes with them, gun fights, idiotic disguises, chase scenes, The Rock hilariously getting cracked out on drugs, inappropriate scenes involving a priest, an AMAZING cameo by Ken Jeong, the traumatic loss of a toe, disposal of dead bodies, embracing the notion of the chubby-chaser, erectile dysfunction...and things constantly go wrong in the funniest of ways.

This all leads to the most ridiculous courtroom criminal trial scene and somehow this is based on a true story!!!!!

This movie enjoys the narration of the ever-personable Mark Wahlberg as Danny Lugo.  Lugo is a personal trainer striving for physical self-improvement in the form of muscle mass--and is doing a pretty good job of it--but he wants more.  He wants the riches and the women; he wants what ""the other guy has.""  In this case, the other guy is Lugo's blow-hard arrogant client Victor.  During training sessions Victor narcissistically runs his mouth about everything he owns and how happy he is to have it, and this gets Lugo salivating.  After Lugo attends an over-the-top self-help seminar from Ken Jeong (The Hangover 2), he decides that he is a ""doer"" not a ""don'ter"" and he decides to get off his ass and take what he deserves...Victor's money!

Lugo recruits Adrien (Anthony Mackie) and the recently saved, sober and released from prison Paul (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson).  Together, these three bumbling fools engage is kidnapping and heists which they believe to be brilliant but lack a certain technical soundness.  Much to my glee, they're far from brilliant.  But they achieve their goals in the most roundabout of ways and it is hilarious at all stages.

Wahlberg has played the fool before (e.g., Boogie Nights, The Other Guys, Ted) and he does it at least as well here.  But the real shocker is Johnson, who plays his most over-the-top, weird, funny role ever.  He preaches AA lines like gospel, seeks to save Victor while torturing him and gets re-hooked on drugs--which leads to some amazingly funny scenes of a tweaked out 6'4"" 260 pounder with crazy eyes and a Fear and Loathing smile.  These guys must have had a blast on the set improvising these scenes because a lot of one-liners and exchanges were priceless.

Among their lies, they pose as famous filmmakers and CIA agents to win the heart of a stripper, who joins their CIA ""team,"" and make a mess of their attempts to be smooth movie criminals.  Later, their involvement with the porn king of southern California gets predictably out of hand as well.

Some great supporting roles come from Ed Harris, who does a fine job as an ex-cop private investigator with a lot of local PD clout, and Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect), a physician's assistant who catches Mackie's eye.

I'm not saying this was necessarily a great movie to the masses. But for me, a Wahlberg/Johnson movie fan and action movie aficionado, this movie was perfect. I loved EVERY MINUTE of the often tasteless, shallow antics and also enjoyed Michael Bay's obligate explosions and chaotic gunfire (which was well-placed a few times in the movie).",1367366400,4,3587,4.9865771812080535
5529727,5,B00AZKY0OW,"Many years ago I asked a friend of mine who was from a totally different culture, ""What is the single biggest difference between your culture and the American culture?"" Her answer was startling! She was surprised by how much Americans idealize criminals! I hope after people watch Pain & Gain that will no longer be true!

Keep in mind Pain & Gain is a true story, which makes it extraordinarily disturbing! Anyone reading this film review may someday, unwittingly, cross paths with people who are as evil and ruthless as the three men in this story are. It's a cautionary tale for us all! One bad guy is charming. One is a bit simple-minded and the other is so ordinary he could easily be your next door neighbor. But they all have one thing in common: They are incredibly selfish and if you get in their way, they are going to kill you.

I have lived in both South Florida and Connecticut and I've seen plenty of snotty rich people who are full of themselves and flaunt their wealth. But does that justify stealing from them and killing them? Two of these three men had steady employment at a half decent job, and they are certainly not starving! What could possibly drive them to such incredible acts of depravity and insanity?

The answer is simple! All three of these thugs wanted wealth and to some degree a glamorous lifestyle. Isn't that what advertising and the rest of the media constantly tells us: We can't be satisfied until were are all both rich and glamorous? That if you're not at least Upper Middle Class, you're some sort of loser or failure?

I was once an Catholic altar boy and I used to attend many Baptisms. There was one question the priest always asks the Godparents that stuck in my mind: ""Priest: Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?"" I could never totally understand what the ""glamour of evil"" meant. How can evil possibly be glamorous? Pain & Gain makes you realize how seductive and glamorous evil can be for anyone who, ironically, is not a strong person!

5529728,2,B00AZKY0OW,"...and went to see a Michael Bay film. My adult daughter seemed to think that a movie with Marky Mark & The Rock lent some sort of credibility to it so I bit the bullet and subjected myself to over two hours of what I can only describe as a near total waste of Miami scenery. Aside from Ed Harris none of the actors cast in this thing are even remotely capable of bringing out any sort of depth in their characters and insofar as comedy goes I think I chuckled out loud twice. Not at dialog but at something that was so ironic that it caused me to shake my head in bewilderment.

In the hands of a talented scriptwriter and director, ala Joel and Ethan Coen, there might have been something redeemable to extract out of this allegedly ""true story"" (I could not be bothered to verify this, I wasted enough time on it as it was) but alas, we are expected to find the act of watching morons in their natural habitat playing in their own excrement entertaining. Any movie maker with an ounce of insight would have realized that the Ed Harris character could have been the soul and focal point of a properly crafted story that had some sort of moral center but that was not to be. What a total and abominable waste of this fine actor. I can only hope that he was paid a ridiculous amount of money for his time and effort.

Having seen a movie like this and not being able to seek out Roger Ebert's review will make me miss his voice even more than I already have since his passing. I had more to say about this monstrosity but I suddenly feel the need to watch Fargo again to remind myself what movie making should be about so consider yourself warned.",1367107200,7,1647,4.258785942492013
5529729,3,B00AZKY0OW,"""It was hard to laugh - so messed up"" - That was how the couple in front of me aptly put it as they were leaving the theater.

This movie many times makes the claim ""this is a true story"" and while it is based on actual criminal events, ""a true story"" is a stretch. Doyle, the most interesting of the three characters, is a fictional composite of people who had much smaller roles in the crime spree than Lugo and Adriane,  and liberties are taken with characterizations of victims and the details. True-crime buffs who want to know more should read one of the excellent books out there for the complete story. Also, Pain and Gain true story? is a good blog that quickly outlines what parts of the movie did and did not really happen.

That aside, looking at this as purely for its entertainment value, it is a fast paced film with a captivating, twisted story line that is not for the squeamish.

I love both Rebel Wilson and Ken Jeong and like a smart, dark comedy. However, I found the casting of these two comedians in this movie (as well as some of the sight-gags) to be a distraction. They are more laugh out loud funny and didn't mesh well into this dark tale.

At the end the narrator explains to us that our take away is to appreciate what we have. I've also heard Michael Bay in interviews say that's what he was going for. I didn't see it. Really what did these criminals have of real worth to begin with? I'd say the message is even for shallow, dissatisfied, and self-absorbed people - money doesn't insure happiness and ill-gained money comes with lots of complications. So even though it pretty much sucks, stick with your pathetic little existence.

My guess is that mainstream audiences will find this movie uncomfortable and that it will be in and out of theaters pretty quickly, but will find a niche market on DVD.",1367020800,12,1834,4.459701492537313
5529730,3,B00AZKY0OW,"Most of us have specific actors or actresses that we follow, both big names and occasionally small.  We grow comfortable watching certain action stars or people that make us laugh, but whether you realize it or not, we also often grow into a habit of watching films directed by certain directors.  The average movie-goer is usually pretty aware of big name directors, like Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese, and probably even the newly popular directors, like Christopher Nolan and J.J. Abrams.  However, a once noteworthy director (mostly known for his action sequences), Michael Bay  has recently gotten lost in the mix - due in large part to the fact that he constantly and consistently makes over-the-top films with high profile action...and far too much dramatic use of wind.  If there's a new Michael Bay movie coming out, you can usually assume it will have a ton of action, plenty of low angle shots, and scenes that look like they are moving in slow motion.  Whether you like Michael Bay's work as a director or not is up to you, but he's usually pretty easy to identify based on his work in films, such as the Transformers trilogy, Bad Boys, and Armageddon.  And his newest film, based on a true story, is Pain & Gain.

Directed by Michael Bay (The Rock, Pearl Harbor), Pain & Gain stars Mark Wahlberg as Daniel Lugo, a bodybuilding instructor that has grown tired of living a life in poverty.  With his friends, Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson), Lugo hatches a plan to kidnap one of his clients, Victor (Tony Shalhoub) and extort his money by means of torture.  After successfully extorting the money, the ""Sun Gym Gang"" attempt to murder Victor, only to repeatedly fail.  Now, broke and without resources, Victor is out to reclaim his money and take down the gang.  Ed Harris, Ken Jeong, and Rob Corddry also star in supporting roles.

In true Michael Bay fashion, it doesn't take long for the slow-motion drama to kick into high gear when Mark Wahlberg is stuck with a police car as he flees from his pursuers.  From there, the film flashes back to the beginning of the plot, unfolding the series of events, which are based on a true story.  Even though the film is based on real life events, the film's writers certainly add a great deal of ""Hollywood"" to this film in the form of humor and violence.  The Sun Gym Gang is portrayed like the Three Stooges of the crime world - bumbling around town, leaving an abundance of evidence for the police to find.  However, the police have no interest in pursuing a case that they deem to be so unbelievable that it can't be true, which is one of the reasons that this plot escalates to the point of murder.

If you can manage to put aside the fact that this is a complete Hollywood production, you may be able to find some enjoyment in the film.  For a film that only had a budget of $25 million, one would have to assume that the majority of that budget went to high profile actors Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson (mostly Wahlberg).  Of course, that's pure speculation, but it's not like these two individuals didn't earn their cut with this film.  In fact, the only real bright spot (for a movie that really didn't need to be made in the first place) are the actors.  Pain & Gain isn't the best performance of Wahlberg's career, but it's certainly not the worst, either.  His charisma sells the main character as the half-witted conman, while Dwayne Johnson is nothing more than comic relief in a film that wasn't meant to be humorous.  There are plenty of humorous moments, including character interactions with sex toys, a chainsaw made in china, and the utter stupidity of the majority of the characters looking the other way while obvious crimes are taking place right in front of their eyes.  And, just like in Armageddon, Michael Bay had to throw in an over-the-top strip club scene.

Overall, this is probably the best Michael Bay film in quite a while (not that he has a long list of overachievers to choose from anyway).  Still, he takes a break from the Transformers franchise to make something totally different than what he's been doing lately, which is a nice change of pace.  But, at the end of the day, it's still a Michael Bay film - chalked full of dramatic low angle, slo-mo shots that would probably cut the film run-time in half if they were cut out completely.  For a true story about a serious situation, this film is turned into one big joke - so it's not entirely a huge surprise that the real life people associated with this story are upset about how Pain & Gain has portrayed them.

5529731,4,B00AZKY0OW,"Based on forty-four Miami New Times newspaper articles by Pete Collins in 1999, this black dramedy is far, far stranger than fiction. As a matter of fact, the real-life participants are less than thrilled with big-budget producer/director Michael Bay's goofy low-budget take on these events.

We see three dim-bulb bodybuilders in Florida who are caught up in an extortion and kidnapping plot because the ringleader is inspired by a motivational speaker (played by Ken Jeong). This knucklehead doesn't want to be ""as good as,"" he wants to be ""better than.""

Here is the cast:
  * Mark Wahlberg (""Broken City"") sincerely believes in ""The American Way."" As things go terribly wrong, he blunders around trying to fix them and only makes matters worse, and worse, and worse.
  * Dwayne Johnson (""Snitch"") found The Lord in prison and would have stayed on the straight and narrow if only it hadn't been for that doggone cocaine. He sings Amazing Grace.
  * Anthony Mackie (""Gangster Squad"") has the best shot at a normal life, but he has spent so much on that gorgeous house.....
  * Ed Harris (""Man on a Ledge"") is a retired detective pulled into the case because the police think it sounds too outrageous. Harris does great comedy because he is soooo deadpan!
  * Tony Shalhoub (""Monk"") is a seriously difficult victim. Even when he is kidnapped and tortured, we end up laughing in spite of ourselves; shades of the Coen Brothers.

This film is rated R, based on the violence, blood, profanity and discussion of body parts. You'll even see some blowie uppie stuff and gunfire, but brace yourself, because you WILL laugh. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I did.

Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1366848000,2,1707,4.841379310344828
5529732,4,B00AZKY0OW,"Pain & Gain (2013)- Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Rebel Wilson, Ed Harris, Tony Shalhoub, Ken Jeong

Premise: Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) is a body builder who is sick of being poor. With his friend, Adrian (Mackie), and an ex-con (Johnson), Danny decides to rob a spoiled and egotistical businessman named Victor Kershaw (Shalhoub). After seemingly succeeding, Kershaw turns to a private investigator (Harris) to recover his finances and deal with the trio...But everything gets out of hand quickly.

Thoughts: This is a Michael Bay film. As such, it matches his general off-kilter aesthetics and love of the ""BOOM, BANG, BOOM"". That said, this is different from his most recent endeavors (i.e. the Transformers) in that it is exceedingly more violent. However, the cast give morbidly entertaining performances which quickly helped make this a much more enjoyable film. Visually intense, dark and even surprisingly violent at times - the film is an enjoyable dark ""R"" comedy.

Should you buy it: This comes down to a matter of taste. Do you regularly enjoy Michael Bay films? Then yes, this is a pretty good purchase. I intend to buy it on Bluray since I found it to be quite enjoyable despite the dark content. Unwilling to commit? Rent away!",1366848000,88,1255,5.053140096618358
5529733,3,B00AZKY0OW,"I am really troubled by this Story and Entertained by the way it was presented.  The troubling part is that this is said to be a true story.

***Stop reading if you don't like spoilers.***

The story starts with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from what is an obvious raid on his place of employment, he's hit by a car and then the story flashes back to 6 Months earlier.

Daniel is a personal trainer at a local Miami Gym and he comes in contact with a very well to do Colombian-Jewish Entrepreneur.  The Entrepreneur's name is withheld to protect the innocent but, needless to say, this guy hires Daniel as Personal Trainer and begins to tell him all about his success in life.

Now Daniel attends a Johnny Wu (Never actually happened) seminar where he is convinced he is A doer and only needs to come up with a plan then make it happen.

One thing leads to another Daniel recruits his two friends, Paul and Adrian, to come up with a plan of how they're going to take the Entrepreneurs life, money, and property away to make it their own.

Needless to say, this whole thing leads to kidnapping, extortion, fraud, attempted murder, a double murder, and two death penalties for 6 months of living the high life.

The acting was decent overall but, playing three dumb, homicidal, muscle heads (no this is not an insult to weight lifters, these guys really were dumb) probably isn't all that challenging.

The movie itself was actually very entertaining, disturbing, and actually well done.  I was given tickets to a screening but, I would have honestly paid to see this movie had I not known what I know now.

If you're okay with somewhat morbidly bizarre comedies then you won't be disappointed by this.  My biggest struggle with the movie was the glamorization of some very violent and tasteless acts.  This is evidenced by the fact Lugo wasn't stupid, some characters were fictional and some were only half fictional and the wife of doorbal actually aided in the cleanup of the two homicides.  In other words, Michael Bay and company went out of the way to make this story more funny than it really was.

Seriously, there are somethings that cannot be unseen or unlearned and this movie has both of these elements.  I would have blissfully enjoyed my suspended reality had they not have flashed across the screen a reminder that it was still a true story amidst two people trying to return a chainsaw with blood and hair on it and the other guy grilling hand that were chopped off their victims.  At that point, the movie went from more funny than disturbing to more disturbing than funny.

I dunno, call me old fashioned but, I cannot in good conscience laugh at somebody else's misfortune unless, I suspend reality.",1366675200,108,2723,4.635416666666667

5529810,1,B00AZKY0OW,"Why would these 2 great actors accept the lead role in such a badly scripted movie?  The actors did a great job with the roles, like they always do; but the script / story was awful.  Too bad I can not get my money refunded.

Mark Wahlberg -- you are a movie star... you do not need to take roles in films that are as terrible as this one.

Mr Johnson -- the Ford commercials are better stories than this movie, why did you accept a role that is so much beneath you?

As a loyal fan, please use judgement in picking your next acting gig, as I spend my hard-earned money to see you in movies and I feel pretty let down with this one",1490659200,,631,3.9761904761904763

5529832,5,B00AZKY0OW,"A hysterical look at a sad, crazy, but true story that happened in Miami. I live in South Florida, and remember when this stuff happened. If not for that knowledge, I would probably disbelieve the ""True Story"" claim. The Rock and Mark Whalberg play 2/3 of a bumbling, steroid fueled, body building crime gang. The fact that these guys were able to get away with what they did for so long is just a testament to how brainless, stupid, and unbelievable their actions were. Their only plus was how disliked the original victim was and how impossible his story was to believe. You watch the mayhem, laugh, and just keep asking yourself that question over and over...How could these idiots possibly get away with this? The true to life events were in no way funny, but in hindsight the ridiculousness of it all makes you laugh. The Rock, Wahlberg, and the supporting cast are all great, and play the events up for the laughs. This is a standout role for Dwayne Johnson. He is excellent as the big, cokehead,  dufus, and Wahlberg's constant infomercial yammering drives the hi-jinx along. One of the best moments in the movie is when the film makers pause during a particularly ridiculous moment to remind you that, indeed, this really happened. Good stuff.",1483315200,5,1251,4.738532110091743

Part of the question is are you able to laugh at steroided up bodybuilders --more highly motivated and pumped up on the American dream than high on brains-- as they engage in a complete bizarre, apparently true, absolutely stupid plan to get rich that involves abusing Tony Shalhoub's character? Having known the type, I really enjoyed this film, but people who do not realize people like this are real and walking among us, probably wouldn't appreciate it nearly as much.

5530599,1,B00AZKY0OW,"Michael Bay's movie Pain & Gain is a monumental train wreck on a number of levels, with the greatest being its comedy. The movie bills itself as a hybrid of drama, action, and comedy yet the comedy is completely nonexistent for the majority of the movie with only brief moments. Instead, sexual comedy is mostly used to an effect that only heightens the ridiculous nature of this crime, bringing the film into a realm of non-belief that never abates and frankly the jokes are just in bad-taste or poorly written.

The characters portrayals by Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, and Anthony Mackie also prove troubling to the film as they are not strong nor can the audience really identify with their wants. Instead, the characters become unbelievable only a quarter of the way through the film and never establishes a stronger connection with their audience.

Overall, the Pain is too much for the viewer. This film was a missed opportunity to portray a true American crime and instead became farcical. The only redeeming characteristic is the ending that is revealed for each character within the film, a fact that was too late to save this film. In conclusion, just skip this film as there are no gains to be had from watching it. If you do watch it though, be forewarned: this is not a film to watch with children around.",1434326400,,1321,4.739130434782608

5530671,2,B00AZKY0OW,"If you followed the plight of the real crimes committed by these characters you might find this film interesting.  Only two things make this movie worth watching otherwise, okay, maybe it's three.  1) Tony Shalhoub.  Tony turns in a difficult performance as a guy you love to hate.  He lends credibility to the plot and is always entertaining on-screen.  2) Dwayne Johnson.  Perfect for the role and great in his voice over narrations and in playing his muscle loving, faith-saved character.  He doesn't overdue it and his screen presence is freaking fantastic.  If the movie was simply told from his character's point of veiw it would have been simpler and far more entertaining. 3) Mark Wahlberg.  Not his best casting in a movie.  You just want to like him too damn much and his character in the film is supposed to be utterly dispicable.  You would think that Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay would have nailed it making a good movie.  They came close, made some pretty entertaining moments - Miami as a back drop is always a great setting - but held too close to the original story of the crime.  Geez, I know you wern't in Hollywood making this film guys, but Hollywood it up a little for the audience!  Watch this fim for the awesome cast.",1433116800,,1243,4.616438356164384

And he's a great actor in dramas as well, I literally was drinking a sprint and spat it out because of how funny he was, Anthony Mackie ( Adrian Doorbal ) who I've seen in other films. I never thought that he was as hilarious as he is, this film starts out with Daniel Lugo ( Mark Walhberg ) who is a fitness trainer and a wannabe entrepreneur and his scheme to become not only a wealthy, entrepreneur. But a somebody within the city where he resides. He gathers a team: Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie ), and Paul Doyle ( Dwayne Johnson ) to discuss the plan that he has for all of them to become wealthy and ""somebody's"" in the community of fitness, at first Paul needed to be persuaded to go along with the plan, after all are aboard with the plan. What comes after they've agreed, is a very entertaining film, the film held together and I didn't see any loopholes in the plot, if you're in for a good laugh check this film out.",1432857600,4,1309,4.177865612648222

5530733,2,B00AZKY0OW,"I was interested in seeing this movie from the first time I ever saw the film trailer for 3 reasons: 1) I've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg since before he became an actor; 2) I'm a fan of Dwayne Johnson, & it has nothing to do with acting; 3) I'm a fan of true crime. Unfortunately for me, I had already seen a 48 Hours story on this where they interviewed the surviving victim soon after the movie release, and I also did research on the crime and the perpetrators. Why is this unfortunate? Because even though you know Hollywood is going to make a story a little flashier, they failed in a few aspects. The 3 guys in this movie (there were actually between 5-9 depending on the point in time) were complete imbeciles. According to investigators, none of them actually were, especially not Daniel Lugo. But them being portrayed that way in the movie had me shaking my head because their actions, statements, & behaviors were most often so idiotic all I could do was either cringe or laugh and shake my head. They also portrayed Adrian as somewhat timid and not being much involved in the violence, when in reality he was the most violent & was the one who actually killed Frank Griga, and no, it wasn't an accident. I know this all seems like semantics, but I guess my point is they made it seem like these guys got caught because they were absolute, utter morons. No, they were just sloppy and greedy. But so much time was spent on making them brainless that it actually sort of came off as bad acting. Also, the real story was still so unbelievably crazy that they could've kept it exactly the way that it was and it probably would've turned out better. I read that the movie was done this way as to make the criminals more sympathetic. Why? They were actually horrible people. Not to mention that the movie left out and/or changed a lot of the actual events, including the fact that the Rock's character didn't exist (his character was an amalgamation of 3 people).

5530772,3,B00AZKY0OW,"Fargo starts with a claim This is a true story which it actually isnt. Michael Bays Pain & Gain also begins with the same claim and it is true, though only partially. Set in the 1990s Miami, the crime comedy follows the story of ""Sun Gym gang, a group of bodybuilders who wanted to get rich quickly by kidnapping a Columbian businessman.

Mark Wahlberg plays the leader of the group. Inspired by Ken Jeongs motivational speaker, he recruits accomplices played by Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie, but his kidnapping plan gets derailed by a series of silly mistakes and accidents.

Like in his Transformers franchise, Michael Bay keeps telling the story very fast. A stupid episode is followed by another stupid episode. We are not given much time to identify with these characters, but thats OK. Characters backstories and observations are often told in voiceovers with a nice satirical touch. Thus the film is pretty entertaining in its first half.

I enjoyed the film, but not as much as I expected in its second half, where horrible things happen one after another. With too much craziness going on, the film does not know what it really wants to do. Satire? Suspense? Perhaps I am supposed to laugh at certain scenes (the big toe scene, for instance), but I find it hard to do. Maybe someone else could have turned the crime story into something more insightful or entertaining.",1430956800,,1383,4.802521008403361

I also have some minor social commentary to add that Hollywood, similar to ""Neighborhood Watch"" in the George Zimmerman horrible aftermath or ""30 Minutes or Less"" after the pizza deliveryman neck bomb, has no business making pathetic buddy comedies out of such disgusting crimes.

(I guess this is a complaint about 'pacing,' but it's a modest one.)  The three amigos here are the main draw, and that's a good thing ... their personalities and relationships carry the flick, and will keep you interested (if ""they can't be that dumb"" works for you as a plot driver ... it only worked for me because, yes, against all expectations, this is pretty much a true story).  I guess steroids, greed and a dedication to 'self-improvement' slogans (as opposed to, say, basic education) can be an ugly mix.  The '90-pound weakling' who went to college has it all over these dumb guys - and will have a better crack at the American dream.",1428192000,,808,4.506849315068493

5531027,3,B00AZKY0OW,"The best part of this movie was watching Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson have so much fun with his role.  His arc went from Jesus freak to cokehead and back again, and he committed fully to every bit of lunacy along the way.  Mark Wahlberg, whom I usually like, was uncharacteristically both monochromatic and unlikable in his role, presumably under Michael Bay's direction.  Tony Shalhoub added vulgarity and Ed Harris sanity to the over-the-top ensemble mixture.

Cinematically the thing was a mess.  Frenetic editing, oversaturated colors, grainy resolution, jarring transitions.  Michael Bay apparently watched a Guy Ritchie film and thought ""I can do that,"" but he couldn't.

The target audience for this R-rated flick is evidently 11 to 15-year-old boys, or people who are feeling in that mood.  I watched it through without fast-forwarding, but I wouldn't care to see it again.",1425945600,,878,5.177304964539007

I gave it a 4 star because it was interesting and unusual. This was based on a true story about how far & low people will go for money. Cheating their way through life using drugs and abusing the system. But it does show how gullible people can be by trickery. I needed to see the end of the movie because I wanted to view the real players that did so much damage to others with their stupid acts.

5531270,5,B00AZKY0OW,"There are so many ""wrong"" things in this movie, in terms of the underlying violence and about
some scenes with drugs and sex, that really make it such a funny and amusing movie.
But to have fun with it you must not take serious all the things you watch, even if it is based on a true
story. Because if humans fall so low then this should have been a drama.
But it's not.
Again, it's funny as hell! The dialogues are insultingly hilarious, and the unusual plot and the out of this world
characters, add to the laughs.
And then Ed Harris enters, and the movie becomes even better!!!

It is all about muscles, women with great bodies wearing typical 90s bikinis, anabolics, drugs, guns, violence
and some really ugly T-shirts.
It is a movie about crimes masked under really funny scenes, where both Wahlberg and Johnson have the muscles and
the mediocre acting to make this movie perfect.
And lets not forget the 2 great cars, a 80s 911 convertible and a Lamborgini convertible, in a really bad color. I am telling
you, a perfect movie

Watch it with a politically correct set of mind, and probably without your girlfriend, because man Wahlberg six pack
can only bring nagging!",1421884800,,1174,4.559241706161138

5531275,4,B00AZKY0OW,"OK, I get it. It was tasteless to make fun of other people's misery and glamorize crime that leads to real-life deaths. With that being said- this movie was much more entertaining than many movies I have seen come out recently.  I will even go as far as to say that this was my favorite Dwayne Johnson role- which as good looking and charismatic as he is, he tends not to be a good actor and is often casted poorly. Some of his better roles I have seen him in were Doom and Walking Tall, which he seemed much more natural in. Walhberg and Mackie were incredible also as well as all the other supporting cast. This has a little bit for everyone- humor, adventure, morbidity, good visuals. It's definitely worth a watch.",1421193600,,718,4.398496240601504
5531276,4,B00AZKY0OW,"This was absolutely the most craziest movie I have ever seen. Ever. Wow. The ONLY reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there's a little too much gore for my liking (spoiler alert: you will see lots of body parts chopped off, shot off, crushed under cars, inappropriate use of chainsaws, LOTS of blood and that horrible scene in Adrian's house with the bench press... ) Excellently written and directed. Plus you wouldn't think you'd find it here but there's an actual Steve Jablonsky soundtrack which adds just the right mix of melancholy to the script. It's the perfect mix of tragedy and humor. I can only imagine how seeing this in the movie would have been. And let me tell you, The Rock? This is his finest acting job to date. This movie. This movie here in my mind takes him to that upper echelon of actors. He's a very misguided soul searching to do right but so easily manipulated. He's this 6 foot bodybuilder with strong faith but an almost childlike understanding of the world that is easily used against him. This movie is great for a peaceful Sunday night at home. Warning, obviously this isn't for kids. But for a night with the boys or even a date movie maybe, this is good.",1420934400,,1196,4.490825688073395

5531291,3,B00AZKY0OW,"I saw this at the movies, and I'm saddened to say- I laughed.  I say it's okay because this movie has some ridiculously crazy/funny parts. I mean so stupid that you can't help laughing and not because it's funny but because the main characters are soooo unbelievably stupid, that it's funny.

The downside is the humor isn't ""funny"" humor, it's stupid almost teenage bad joke humor. It saddened me because this movie is based on a true story and I felt horrible that I was laughing at someone's real life situation and the movie seemed like a spoof of it. Reality viewing has gone from prime time to the big screen and that is sad.

Hopefully the victim was compensated well for allowing this movie.",1420761600,,699,4.576

Neither my wife or I liked this at all.  Some may like this type of sick, dark humor, but I don't need to watch really dumb people to make myself feel smarter.  The portrayal of bodybuilders as brainless idiots can either be seen as off-comedy or a stereotypical degradation perhaps undeserved.  If I were Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg, this would be one I would want stricken from my portfolio.  I really felt sorry for them.  Overall, I cringed at the repetition of mindless and often graphically violent stupidity much more than I laughed.

5532357,3,B00AZKY0OW,"An over two hour movie that follows a trio of the world's stupidest criminals and their botched up plans to abduct and intimidate a business man into signing over his wealth and possessions to them.  Based on a true story (in fact the movie shows you the real people at the end who weren't anywhere near as huge as Wahlberg and Johnson's muscular frame but that's Hollywood retelling for you).  The movie is fun in that you just can't believe how stupid this trio of steroid injecting body builders were.  I'm sure anyone who has ever been to a gym has seen guys like this constantly looking in the mirror and the actors all do a good job of portraying this element of gym goer.  I would have liked to have not had the ending given away at the beginning of the film though, it was unnecessary to tell the story as a flashback, and would have worked better with the viewing going in blind as to how this tale was going to turn out.

A lot better movie than most of the others that Wahlberg or ""The Rock"" usually star in.

I know some people may be offended watching this movie as it is making light of a very serious crime but I can not picture this movie as a drama considering all the stupid things those guys did.

It does seem like it's going to be a comedy about a couple of heroic chums, so some may be annoyed to find that in fact it's a hilarious but sad true story. The storytelling is uncharacteristically good for a modern Michael Bay film, with a strong supporting cast. Mark Wahlberg is completely believable in this persona, and The Rock seems to relish his ""sober Jesus meathead"" role. The reviews made me think this was going to be terrible, but a director friend of mine recommended it, and I enjoyed it.

Genre: it is an action comedy, but in traditional terms it is a ""based on a true story"" tragedy.

User guide: despite the presence of several talented comedic cast, this is not a lighthearted family movie. It is full of violence, drug use, blasphemy, a death toll with a fair amount of blood, rampant protagonist crime, strong language, racism, a longer-than-necessary strip joint scene with female nudity, and occasional erotic innuendo and immodesty throughout the film not appropriate for children.",1409616000,,1081,4.806451612903226

The all too infrequent times I've seen him in a comedy, I thought that if he was given a chance, he would be hysterical.  And speaking of hysterical, Rebel Wilson is one of the funniest women in films today (as long as she isn't writing the script).  Then I saw the names Ed Harris and Tony Shalhoub - two great actors - and said, ""how bad could it be?""
BAD. Oh so bad; I finished the movie just so I could see how bad it could get - and in got worse!

I'm not telling you to save your money and not see it;  I'm talking about walking the other way if someone offered ME money to see this movie!!(okay, maybe if it was lots and lots of money and I had some drugs I could take to pass out just as the movie began)...

By the way, I didn't forget about Wahlberg - this deplorable review would be even longer if I spoke about him.  I think at times he can act; when he understands the movie, likes the script, and has a director that knows what he's doing and keeps him on a short leash . Let me put it this way:  Mark Wahlberg was a twelve year old ADHD sufferer who had missed a couple of doses of Ritalin.

The problem is that the characters in this film have zero redeeming qualities.

If this film was made with a different tone it could have worked, but it just makes a mockery of the whole story and is completely disrespectful to the victims (and their families) of these 3 scum bags.

Honestly, what was the point of this movie? It's like if Spielberg instead made Schindler's List a black comedy from the Nazi perspective, albeit on a much smaller scale, but you get the point.

I wish Bay would have delved slightly deeper into character development, not to say that, the narrations and going back in time did not lend to this, but the final outcome did raise questions, for me that is, as to what ultimately motivated the characters to such desperate actions.

Boredom will surely set in if you try to stick with it, but that means you'll probably make a sandwich, catch up on Facebook, and maybe do a little shopping on Amazon or eBay, so that's cool.
However, the acting is actually quite good, so for that I would give this 1.5 stars if I could.

The real problem with this movie is that the main characters get caught.  The acting actually does a good job of making you care about and root for these stupid scumbags.  Meanwhile, the victims are jerks and deserve what's coming to them, so you're glad they got screwed over.  You end up wanting these lovable, idiot criminals to get away with it, but they don't so the ending is really sad and disappointing.  If they got away from the police in the end, that might have made up for the movie being too long.  Movie chase scenes are better when your star gets away.",1406332800,,1238,4.216101694915254

Along with The Rock and Bad Boys, Pain and Gain shows that Bay can make a good film when it comes to just people interacting with people.

Ignore Transformers, ignore garbage like The Island, and go for the smaller-scale Bay films. This one in particular is great. Hilarious, outrageous, and TRUE.",1405641600,,766,4.803030303030303

But by either dumb luck or skill (or maybe by staying close to the true story) this film turned out to be a dark comedy masterpiece - in my humble opinion!
From one scene to the next I was both shocked by the gruesome horror of what was happening (knowing it's a true story) and laughing my [butt] off, at the same time!  All the main actors were able to sell the callously brutal, yet amazing stupid characters that they were portraying.
 The supporting actors (Tony Shalhoub, Ed Harris, etc.) were superb (or maybe superbly directed???).
If you've got a dark, sarcastic sense of humor, like me - I highly recommend this film.  If you don't have that kind of a sense of humor, you might be over-whelmed by the gory-ness of some scenes, and generally come away from the movie with a very negative feeling.

Well, the dog, a beautiful brindle greyhound named Seven, is not in the film very much--just a few scenes--but I really enjoyed the movie anyway. Oddly enough I was living in Miami during the time that the real-life events of the film happened, but had missed the story.

And what a weird story this is! The film changes a few things, but quite a lot of it is true to life and accurate. It's best to see the film first, and then Google the real story.

5534449,3,B00AZKY0OW,"We like Dwayne Johnson.  We like Mark Whalberg.  We like Tony Shalhoub.  The movie is free with our Amazon Prime membership.  How could we be disappointed watching a free movie chalked full of entertaining actors?  We went in with reasonably low expectations, and those expectations, I have to say, were met.  It was entertaining, and didn't require you pay a lot of attention to keep up with the story.  There was weightlifting, steroids, police chases, seemingly unnecessary acts of violence, obnoxious/arrogant rich guys being robbed and tortured, and notes all along the way letting you know this is a true story.

Not having done any research on the background of the film, these little reminders that it is a true story were maybe the most intriguing part of the film.  The movie was ok and, sure enough, it is based (loosely) on a true story.  After reading about some of the real life events, it felt a little awkward having laughed at some of the things that were done to various characters.  The excessive ""meanness"" that was conveyed by the main characters, paired with their gross incompetence, made everything seem unrealistic and laughable.  I imagine the individuals who really went through this, those who survived, likely didn't laugh at all.

Three stars for being just mindless entertainment when you want to watch something but have no burning desire to watch anything specific.  If you are familiar with the real life events, you may not agree three stars is justified.",1403481600,,1490,4.931726907630522
5534450,5,B00AZKY0OW,"Frankly, I'm don't usually write reviews; but since I did not watch this movie based on stars (not even from Redbox) I had to put in my two cents' worth.  First everyone did a great job in portraying their character.  In fact many of the laughs comes from seeing actors in roles one would never picture them in.  My only problem with watching the movie as a comedy was that it is supposed to be a true story but at least it happened in Florida and justice was delivered.  If individuals find the story hard to believe, well, America's prison population isn't exploding because the inmates went to college or refused to participate in illegal mind altering chemicals.  If you can laugh at 21 Jump Street and actually want a sequel, you should love this movie.  If you are more into true crime drama but feel the need for a good laugh, you will enjoy this movie.  If you are looking for an Oscar contender, well, maybe you should pass it up, but for me, it certainly beats most reality TV and makes one think twice about grumbling about one's life.",1403481600,,1046,4.445026178010472

What do all three want in common? Change, a new lifestyle - wealth.

One of the main things I liked about this movie is that I'm still not convinced this was a true story. I can't believe they got away with this, it's pretty hilarious. The actors played their roles very well, especially The Rock. There's a lot of action and drama going on to grasp one's attention.

No this isn't a comedy like Animal House or the like, this is a dark and gritty crime movie that is based loosely on true events.  The movie was well played out and all the characters were likeable/dislikeable just as they should be.  They didn't play off the murder of people, they made fun of situations that needed to be made fun of.  Many one liners in the movie gave me a good chuckle.

Plot is always moving...fast, fast, fast. Ed Harris adds an essential role which, anchors the story, in believability. Shalom is terrific as a 'captured-kidnapped' person of interest. Perhaps one of DeWayne Johnson's better films. The musical score could have been more 'lively.' Entertaining and a romp in the park, so to speak, for pure escapism. Probably not a true story, or, even based on a single story, but, fun and great looking women (not overdone). The dialogue is quite well written, albeit, 'low brow.'

Apparently Michael Bay wants us all to laugh hysterically while people are being murdered and cut to pieces. Don't get me wrong, it has its funny parts but it just seems like the movie wants us to root for and sympathize with the villains. It comes across as a Three Stooges type situation where we aren't supposed to blame the main characters for their actions because they are supposedly too dumb to know what they are really doing. I'd normally maybe be okay with this, but knowing that the events in this movie are based on real-life events made it disturbing that zero sympathy was shown towards the victims who we are supposed to regard as getting what they deserved.",1401667200,,839,4.526315789473684

I literally LAUGHED OUT LOUD when about 2/3rds into the movie during a bizarre scene, they flashed across the bottom, ""This is Still A True Story.""

What was so funny (yet simultaneously sad) about this movie was how absolutely DUMB/STUPID/IGNORANT these guys were.  I guess it's the perverse side of me that found this movie entertaining.

Ultimately, what was frightening was the fact that this level of stupidity could possibly lead to this kind of colossal evil.  What they did was nothing short of a horrific act that warrants them to stay in jail for the rest of their lives (if not put to death).  A black comedy (if it could be considered a comedy) for sure.  Twisted, but bizarrely funny.

Yes, one said porn. There is brief nudity due to a scene at a strip club, but other than those 'horrible' things, the movie is quite entertaining. Loosely based off of real events, the film runs at 2 hours & moves at a brisk pace. Great acting & dialogue help the film, and frankly to me, it was a lot of fun to watch. Without giving away spoilers, three down on their luck guys who know each other at a exercise club decide on a criminal act that will turn their money problems upside down. Of course, it doesn't happen that easily, so that's where helpings of black comedy set in. Some Michael Bay actors in his past movies show up here, including the always great Ed Harris & a cameo by Peter Stormare. Mark Wahlberg & Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are in fine form, as are Anthony Mackie & Tony Shalhoub. Bar Paly as a stripper who is constantly lied to by the main cast is a riot as well.

And the Shalhoub (who I would suggest can do nothing wrong), what a disconnect between his charisma and this script.  The jokes were flat, the slow cam felt out of place and it was lit like Transformers, but that just makes you sad when you realize it's only pretending to be an action movie.  I just wish this movie could have figured out what it wanted to be: comedy, action, chaser.  Instead, I just realized that I wanted to be somewhere else.

If not for the presence of the Rock, however, this movie would be forgettable... but he delivers a hilarious performance that I believe to be the high mark of his weird career. He had me laughing aloud many, many times during this movie - he literally saved the flick, as far as I'm concerned. I think this is his most defining role thus far, and I hope he continues to go for these comedic movies... he's got a real knack for it!",1401321600,,748,4.58955223880597

5534862,2,B00AZKY0OW,The saving grace for this film is that it was actually a true story. It would have been equally effective as a written short story or something in that avenue.

It took me a while to figure out why this movie disappointed me, but I think it feels like a bad movie because the story is not believable. The acting in the movie is good and I like the actors a lot, but the main characters, including the victim, are so unlikable it's hard to watch. The only character I wanted to like was Dwayne Johnson's, but his character too turned out to be an idiot. The best part of this movie is the message it delivers to young people, assuming they have half a brain. It does in no way glorify crime, these morons get what they deserved. The violence was a little excessive, some of the most graphic parts could have been left more to the imagination, but it's by no means among the worst. If this could have been made G rated, something I don't think is possible, I would show it to my kids as a warning of what happens to criminals.",1401235200,,969,4.18716577540107

If you are in the mood for an absurd, crazy movie, this is perfect. It was bizarre. I like the actors enough that I watched it but I often thought, ""What the....!?"" Then realized it was based on a true story. The epitome of ""Truth is stranger than fiction."" WOW!",1401148800,,428,4.047058823529412

5534910,1,B00AZKY0OW,"Pain and Gain never really found its way. From the beginning of the movie you anticipate a comedy along the lines of The Other Guys. The movie holds this tone even through the first kid napping and extortion. The movie takes a turn to the more serious side, after cocaine addictions and penile injections cause the incompetent crime team to pursue and second target - resulting in murder and dismemberment of the victims. I also did not appreciate the satirical view taken toward Christianity in the movie. I found it utterly offensive. In brief, save yourself 2 hours and don't watch this movie.",1401148800,,596,4.796116504854369

5534924,3,B00AZKY0OW,"I enjoyed it on a popcorn level.  The previews sold it more as comedy which at best it is a black comedy.

In the end it is kind of like Michael Bay's Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.  It's a very dark film about some messed up people that keep justifying doing messed up things.

Dwayne Johnson in particular was showing some range here outside of his more typical roles.",1401148800,,373,4.285714285714286

It does kind off gloss over the murder which I can understand upsets the real life victims family, but this is not a lifetime movie. Mark Walberg, Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie were all awesome together. They had really great onscreen chemistry. As a lady seeing Mark Walberg in his underwear took this movie up another notch. It has action for the male viewers as well. A good movie for any mature audience.",1401148800,,521,4.4375

Just because this is a true event, doesn't give it legitimacy to be a movie.  Neither did feeble attempts to find humor in torture give it any levity.  Perhaps I misunderstood the intent of the movie, or perhaps I'm not part of the target audience, but I found it simultaneously both disturbing and somewhat boring.

Direct action toward a goal, the kind who, in the weight room, might lift the soda machine, just to vent some rage and let others know how much rage they have.

If this movie were only one quarter true, if the director didn't feel the need to insert the caption- ""this is still a true story,"" three quarters of the way through, then, oddly, it might be ore believable.

Basically, its a true story of physical trainers tired of being poor coming up with a get rich scheme. They do this by kidnapping one of the rich gym members and holding him captive. When he sees their faces, they have to kill him (this is drawn out involving being hit by a car multiple times).

When they run out of money again, they try to scam a potential investor and end up killing him (a weight falls on his head by accident. Blood everywhere). Multiple times they are chopping up bodies. In the end, they're caught.

5535094,1,B00AZKY0OW,Mark Wahlberg is one of my favorite actors.  I was excited to start this movie but never drew us in.  We finally stopped watching it.  More of a weird documentary than a movie,1400630400,,175,4.242424242424242

5535096,2,B00AZKY0OW,"In all the Wahlberg films that I've seen up to now he's played believable and entertaining characters. All the ones outside of the ""sci-fi / fantasy"" realm did not disappoint, but unfortunately this one did. Not Mark's fault because he does his characteristic good job. The writers got this completely wrong. Here are some details:

1) The movie is based on a true story, and although the viewer is reminded through the film that it is a true story, they don't stick to the facts. Wahlberg's character doesn't kill the guy at the end, his partner does. The victim was roughly the same age as the villains. Etc. Etc.
2) The movie makes the kidnapping, torture and killing of its victims a matter of comedic portrayal. Yes, the factual case was bizarre, but to lionize the main characters who commit the crimes is a bit much. Barbecue grilling of the hands? Come on guys. Not true and definitely not funny. Which is happens throughout the film. Humor and slapstick is blurred with real and imagined grotesqueness and there's no need for it.
3) I love the Rock character, Duane Johnson. I was expecting his characteristic GI Joe / Scorpion King persona. He plays an idiot with no real moral compass except....
4) We have to deal with the stereotypical Hollywood portrayal of Christianity. In this case Johnson's character is born again in prison but doesn't internalize that the tenets of Christianity contains the Golden Rule and the Ten Commandments as absolutes. Sigh. So to accept this ""based on true events"" the viewer is left to believe that some manner of Christianity allows subjectivity to hurt others? Thanks guys.
4) ""Victor Kershaw"" represents the real life victim Marc Schiller who was kidnapped, tortured for a month to force him to sign over around $2mm in assets and then crashed in his car, set on fire and run over in an attempt to kill him. He lived. The police ignored his story as too unbelievable even when a quick fact check would have nabbed the perpetrators. They eventually killed 2 people when they could have been apprehended. After the murders, Shiller is instrumental in the conviction of these guys. Then he gets arrested, thrown in jail for Medicaid fraud and stripped of what little he has left. Slight details to omit.

In conclusion, the film had the potential to be informative and entertaining. If it wasn't so far from the truth of the actual facts. If it didn't aggrandize torture and murder for gain as comedic. If it didn't bash Christians. And if it would have told the true story of the first victim, his marginalization by police and the eventual tragedy and still daily trauma these funny guys comedically caused him on the way to murdering, cutting up and grilling their next 2 victims.

5535098,3,B00AZKY0OW,"This is a well made film with several well know actors.  However, the mixed reviews I suspect is due to the fact that the film tells the true story of some musclebound nitwits who tried to kidnap, torture and murder their way to riches.

5535107,4,B00AZKY0OW,Mark Wahlberg and Dwyane Johnson are clearly enjoying themselves in this black comedy that recounts the true-life story of a band of misfit body-builders searching for the American dream.  It is destined to be a classic.,1400630400,,220,5.111111111111111

5535126,5,B00AZKY0OW,"If you are looking for something to take your mind off of reality, and don't mind crude humor, I definitely recommend this. Hot naked chicks, good actors, dark humor, and nearly constant action. What more is there to want?",1400544000,,222,4.717948717948718
5535127,4,B00AZKY0OW,"I read about half of Marc Schiller's book ""Pain and Gain,"" and when I reviewed it, I gave that review's title something like ""More Pain Than Gain.""  It wasn't that I wasn't interested in his story -- quite the contrary, as I've seen quite a few documentaries on it as a matter of fact -- it was just that I thought he would have been better served working with a professional writer to tell his tale.  The story then surely would have been more polished.

I think that a lot of people know about Mr. Schiller's story, and I think that a lot of people feel his pain.  That's all well and good; he was treated like a POW victim by his captors.  But I believe that those same people perhaps became a little too personally attached to the story, and probably those same people saw this film and panned it.

Like I've said a million times before, books and film are different media.  And this same story was told by different writers of those media in different ways.  Here, the screenwriter decided to use levity, and to go in a more satirical direction with the story than the book.  I think that that's OK, even though I can understand if Mr. Schiller isn't too happy about the film.  (Peeking around the web I believe that there are lawsuits attached to this film, due to story ownership.  Stay tuned on that.)

But I was pretty happy when I saw that this was available for free with Amazon Prime.  I've wanted to watch it for quite a while, and I jumped at the chance.  This film is ridiculous, but it's supposed to be; some of the humor is pretty top notch.  I laughed my head off when Ken Jeong, playing someone named Johnny Woo, was giving his ""Get Rich Quick"" seminar.  In particular, the ""Everyone is either a doer or a don'ter"" line killed me.  By the way:  did I spell ""don'ter"" right?  Well, no matter either way.  I started thinking about it, and from what I remember, seminars were really popular during the timeframe of this story so it made the scene even funnier.  And I've always thought seminars are ridiculous myself, but not ridiculous in a good way, like this film.

It's unfortunate that Mr. Schiller was more than thrown under the bus by his captors.  But I also think that it's unfortunate that Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson -- who is terrific here, by the way -- and the rest of this fine cast, were also thrown under the bus by critics for making this film, mostly for what I believe to be political reasons rather than artistic reasons.

If you can separate yourself from the actual story and understand that this is meant to be satire, then you should like it.  If you can't?  Well, go read a book.  Films -- in particular satire -- may not be your thing.",1400544000,,2680,4.394308943089431

In fact, I watched it again a few days after the first viewing.
True, it had humorous (some very humorous) parts in it and some folks may say that is wrong, but that is what black/dark comedy is all about.
In an even more positive light, the film just may serve as a cautionary tale to those who need it.....",1400544000,,528,4.217821782178218

In fact, they represent the worst in human interaction. In some scenes good acting saves it, as in the wonderful performance by Tony Shalhoub. (He may be the first victim in a long time you want to see beaten) And in others, who do not need to be mentioned, overacting is just bad. Still, an eye catching hour and a half with a small message for all of us on the seven deadly sins, or at least some of them.

I like both Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson, but the film was unwatchable. I quit about twenty minutes into it. If you like Wahlberg and action with comedic overtones, check out ""The Italian Job"" or ""The Truth About Charlie,"" or the zany and sometimes hilarious ""The Other Guys."" As for Dwayne Johnson you'd be better served to watch him in ""Be Cool"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain."" But ""Pain and Gain"" is a pain with no gain.",1400544000,,538,4.5

It was either comic genius and all tongue in cheek (Jesus Freak the Rock with a green beard), or they were actually trying to make a serious buddy movie.  Either way - I found it highly entertaining. Mark Wahlberg is almost a caricature of himself, everything he said made me laugh.  Anyway, don't be scared off by bad reviews - either this is one you will find you enjoy or hate (like Big Lebowski, or Napolean Dynamite - okay  maybe not that good).",1400284800,,508,4.315789473684211

This movie was vaguely interesting because it was based on a true story and despite the horrific crimes, one has to laugh at the idiocy of the criminals. Call it the banality of evil.

Wahlberg's acting reminds you of his professional training as an expert underwear model, and special forces-level boy band singer. Watching this movie is like sticking an ice pick in your forehead. You can do it if you want to but seriously why do you want to?",1400284800,,604,4.532110091743119

I kept saying how can this stuff be real and would laugh hysterically or just shake my head in disbelief.

  Mark Whalberg, perfect as the clueless Daniel Lugo, Dwayne Johnson (turning in one of the best performances of his career), and Anthony Mackie make the movie fun to watch. However, it's Tony Shalhoub (Monk) who steals the movie as a kidnap victim. Plus, Ed Harris is in it and he's awesome in pretty much everything.
  Pain and Gain is good movie, well worth the watch. Even better, it's free on Amazon Prime. You can't lose.",1400198400,8,645,4.5344827586206895

I just kept clicking forward and back trying to find something to like. Unfortunately, again, Mark Wahlberg chose poorly. On the bright side - he is rolling in bank, and those who paid for this drivel must have found something to justify their hourly wages skittering away under the weight of this so called film. One hell of a way to make a paycheck big M; off of the backs of the public that supports your sorry ass.

There isn't even a character with whom to identify with or root for. The acting was atrocious, but I'm not sure if that's because the script sucked or the actors sucked. Either way it sucked.

It's definitely not a family fun action movie that is fun for all ages. The marketing department for this movie should definitely reconsider their line of work. That isn't to say that this was a bad movie. True to life, it probably is not. Marc Schiller is the real name of the guy that the Sun Gym gang extorted, but he wasn't consulted at all in the making of this movie. He actually has a lot to say about how this movie was made. Mark Wahlberg is always so good at creating a character that is a lovable idiot. In that respect, the casting was done right. He's got a great body, can act, and can pull off an idiot doing something stupid. This movie made me look up what really went down. What actually happened was even more brutal and Marc Schiller definitely did not deserve to have any of that stuff happen to him. In the movie they renamed him Kershaw to protect him, but Schiller came out against the movie.which kind of undermined the whole thing. What really happened was insanity for everyone. Even though 2 of the 3 guy got sentenced to death, none of them are dead as of the review. As far as movies go, it's actually surprisingly good. I didn't expect to be as into it as I was.

I was skeptical to watch this,movie at first, due to the lacklustered reviews and negative comments...Boy, were you naysayers wrong.  I found it compelling and the character presentation were excellent.  You could not help ""like"" Mark Warburg at his quest for power and prestige, all knowing he is portraying the sickest criminal.  I could not turn the film off!  Believe me, for I am NOT the usual fan of Micheal Bay's high energy box office smashes that lacks cerebral content that our country prefers.  Of course there are some ridiculousness in the film that you can see for yourself, but this film displays raw emotion, even though the overall plot is negative.

5535573,4,B00AZKY0OW,"The last year brought four films which, in different ways, deal with the same topic:  amoral materialism run amok in todays America.  They are:  The Bling Ring; Spring Breakers; The Wolf of Wall Street; and Pain and Gain.  In my view, despite its brutality, crudity, and ugliness, Pain and Gain is the best.  If you can stand it.

Amazons customer reviews reveal roughly a 50-50 split.  Interestingly, Rotten Tomatoes.com, which collects critic reviews on films, shows a virtual tie between the pros and the cons.  The outraged negative reaction doesnt surprise me.  Pain and Gain is not a pleasant film.  Many people were turned off by the raw language and sexual references.  Others abhorred the violence.  And others, oddly, despite all that sex and violence, were bored.

That the Bling Ring was directed by Sofia Coppola may explain why it fared somewhat better with the critics--but not with Amazon customers--than Pain and Gain.  That Pain and Gain was directed by Michael Bay no doubt hurt the film with some critics.  (What if the same film been directed by a critical darling like Quentin Tarantino?  Pulp Fiction overflows with both violence and crudity.)

Pain and Gain isn't a comedy.  Overall, the mood is pitch black.  There is simply nothing funny about graphic violence inflicted on even sleazy victims.  Still, the film contains many absurd, laugh-out-loud moments, such as when the criminals botch the first kidnap attempt or when one of them fastens the victims seat belt before crashing his car.  Or when head criminal Mark Wahlberg organizes a Neighborhood Watch meeting, after moving into victim #1s posh house.

Other moments produce reflexive shock laughter, the kind weve all experienced in life.

The films message about greed, the things people do for material gain, is bleak indeed.  And, in this regard, the film is absolutely uncompromising and stark.  Here were not dealing with Wall Street crooks or spoiled 20-somethings in L.A.  Here the stakes are , great bodily injury, life and death.

To Michael Bays credit, he does not play the murder scene for laughs.  And he doesnt prettify the three attempted murders on victim #1, though the victims resilience does produce shock laughter.  (He does cross the line, however, when the males at the Neighborhood Watch get-together eagerly volunteer to role-play an attempted rapist.  Not funny.)

The writing is damned good, with a spot-on sense of real-life criminals.  Prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, and judges can cite chapter-and-verse about criminals who overrate their intelligence, who turn on one another when the going gets rough.

The cast is terrific.  Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson (yes, he can act), Anthony Mackie (from The Hurt Locker), Tony Shalhoub, and Ed Harris.

Im not a Michael Bay fan.  But hes made good films before.  (See, The Rock, selected for the elite Criterion Collection DVD series).  Hes done it again.  If you can stomach the violence and deal with the sexual references, Pain and Gain is well worth watching.  Otherwise, avoid.",1397692800,,3049,5.105476673427992

5535621,2,B00AZKY0OW,"A Hollywoodized true story based a dastardly crime taken from multiple magazine articles by Pete Collins and warped significantly by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely does not a comedy make. Michael Bay's surprisingly clunky direction doesn't help nor does the barely above tolerable acting by a group of high paid actors. An action/comedy based on some real life heinous history? Don't think so.

In the 1990s, during the rise of physical fitness gyms, Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) a borderline stupid Miami bodybuilder wants to live the American dream. He would like to have the money that other people have. So he enlists the help of fellow bodybuilder Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) and ex-convict, Christian bodybuilder Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson). Their kidnapping of wealthy Colombian Jew Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) and extortion scheme to get all his ill-gotten gains goes terribly wrong since they have muscles for brains and they're left to haphazardly try to hold onto the elusive American dream. Some cameo roles by Ken Jeong, Ed Harris, Peter Stormare, Tony Plana, Rebel Wilson, Larry Hankin and a huge cast ignite the tasteless story for a few moments, but for the majority of time the `comedy' is gory and simply not at all fun - nor is the true story upon which it is loosly based.

5535624,3,B00AZKY0OW,"Three bumbling juice heads led by Daniel Lugo (a motivated Mark Wahlberg) out to make quick cash kidnap Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub doing his best John Turturro impression), who is pegged as a financially wealthy ne'er-do-well by Lugo, after Kershaw comes into Sun Gym to tone up.  You see, Lugo's dreams have never quite worked out as he's wanted them.  He wants the sun, the burn of a good workout that leads to the satisfaction of a ripped bod, and to be his own boss living his dream of destiny as a wealthy and well-looked upon owner of his own gym.  As those tony dreams don't quite pan out he enlists the aid of fellow gym rat Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie, beefing up for his role in the upcoming Marvel movie ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" no doubt) and ex-con pussycat in a tiger's body Paul Doyle (the surprisingly versatile Dwayne Johnson) in a scheme of kidnapping and extortion that turns both sublimely ridiculous and sickeningly unsavory at practically every turn.

This group of meatheads are true bumblers and this lends the film its humorous tone though I assure you that the subject matter of the film is gruesomely dark; it's a little disconcerting that we can laugh at this.  And it is the films unsavory aspects that ultimately bring this film down.  I know that we're supposed to buy into and essentially overlook the horrible actions of these doofuses because they're practically cartoon lampoons and the film's setting is sun-drenched Miami where everyone looks fabulous but these guys are involved in killing and dismembering other people, using large drills and hatchets and saws to hack people (yes, they're already dead at this point but still...) apart.  That's just not a funny thing in my book.

The actors portray mostly everyone as possessing the emotional depth of an inflatable kiddie pool (with perhaps the lone exception being that of unlucky victim Kershaw) and it's true that they infuse their performances with a certain dim abandonment (they do a good job).  I could see people likening this film to ""Fargo"" but the difference is that in ""Fargo"" the villains really were villains, here they're but a ten-year-old boy who dreams in casual lack of effect fantasy, and as such that makes these very different movies.

5535628,5,B00AZKY0OW,"This movie is extremely stylish, so much so, that it will undoubtedly turn you off if you cannot handle it. Are you a fan of kinetic pitch-black comedies? Then this is one of the wildest and darkest movies I've ever seen on a big budget level. Think of something written by vintage Coen Brothers and directed by Guy Ritchie or Tony Scott. Indeed, this movie is that good - it's screwball noir with a message.

Featuring a trio of meatheads and their moronic get-rich scam that goes to all hell, this story was a riot. Inventively told through multiple perspectives with a variety of flashbacks, dream sequences, and even different characters doing voice overs, the movie moves a mile a minute and is constantly surprising the viewer with a variety of clever twists and turns.

I see that many critics of this film fault it for being ""too stupid to be true."" Well, unfortunately for the uninformed viewer who makes strange snap judgments based on the actual veracity of the plot, the story is astoundingly accurate in regards to its most unbelievable moments, which only adds to its greatness.

But what ultimately elevates the film to art beyond the fact that it's highly entertaining, deeply suspenseful and hysterically funny, is its many observations on American greed and ambition. I guess because Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street"" has the right pedigree, it gets elevated to Oscar nominations. This ""Michael Bay"" movie is extremely akin to that one: debauched antiheroes fiendishly stealing the American dream. Yet while I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wolf"" too, this flick is actually the smarter film. ""Wolf"" largely portrays their cast of characters as unstoppable party monsters. Yet ""Pain and Gain"" deals with a much richer and more developed crew, who each have far more personality and depth to wrestle with the good and evil motives. I felt far more for these sad losers than I ever did for the amazing DiCaprio. And while ""Wolf"" studied the upper-echelon of 90s white-collar crime, this movie has more universal appeal with its take on the scummy everyman looking to get rich quick.

My wife who normally despises this kind of movie - loud, crude, violent action-comedy - thoroughly loved it too. So don't let ""Michael Bay directing Marky Mark and the Rock"" fool you, this is a seriously cool and intelligent movie.",1391385600,5,2319,4.923273657289003

5535632,3,B00AZKY0OW,"I have to state that making a satire out of a real criminal act that involved abduction, torture and even murder of supposedly innocent people won't sink in lightly with many people out there as they'll view it as offensive and inappropriate. Which they do have every right to do so, it's inhumane to laugh about the death and sufferings of anyone. However, my dark humour tendencies cannot dislike this movie and I have to admit my dark side has gotten the better of me.

I liked the idea that the producers of this film has made it a comedy instead of going through the old tragedy route. That was refreshing and that made the film bearable for the most part. I don't think I could've managed to set through it otherwise. Although there are inaccurate details that never happened in real life, most of the movie *at least the important parts* hold true to the story.

A lot of reviews here were complaining about the fact that the director glorifies the Sun Gym Gang and their tedious crimes against their victims. However, I do not see that aspect in this movie at all. Just because the movie is about them doesn't mean it represents them as heroes, actually the movie makes them exactly what they were criminal minds with very little intellect to go with it. Which was their ultimate downfall. It also states the misconception these people had about the idea of the American Dream. Funny enough, in their point of view living the American Dream meant that they had to be rich they just chose the wrong way to do it and ended up getting what they deserved the end.

I give it three stars, because although it was entertaining and the acting was moderately good as well as the script. It could've been better, there was a lot of mumbo jumbo going on in some scenes that was a bit confusing. Also, this is isn't the best thing that has ever been made in the history of film making. Overall, decent effort.

I understand many people have hated it and would not agree with me, Do I recommend this movie? Yes if you have nothing else to watch this would be a nice time passer.",1391126400,,2074,4.464379947229552

I don't think my husband and I made it 30 minutes into it before my husband asked me if I'd had enough yet and we took it out and wondered if we knew anyone that might actually like it that we could give it to.  It'll most likely end up in a Goodwill bag.  The constant internal monologue was beyond annoying, it was downright painful.  The folks responsible for making this ""movie"" would've gotten the same result if they'd stood some egotistical moron up in front of an audience (who'd been strapped into their seats so they couldn't escape then had their caffeine source removed), reading his life story from a book while a T & A movie was playing on a screen behind him.  There was no plot.  They took 2 perfectly good actors and stuffed them into a crappy movie doing crappy acting.

5535681,5,B00AZKY0OW,"PAIN AND GAIN is based on a true story which i didn't know til i watched the film
it's about 3 personal trainers working at a Gym in Miami during the 90'S
from 1994-1996 to be exact
Mark wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo who's a personal trainer and Manipulator and that's all he is
he's in pursuit of the American Dream and is brainwashed to live the American Dream
Daniel becomes a client's personal trainer at the Gym
and listens to all his secrets, advice etc and mark goes ahead and steals his money, fortune his life
Dwayne Johnson plays an ex con who has found Jesus and becomes very religious straight ahead Guy
both Mark and Dwayne's Characters become friends
Daniel manipulates Dwayne's character to get him into a criminal enterprise
the 3rd personal trainer Anthony Mackie joins the team aswell

all 3 trainers have no idea what there getting themself into
Mark's the leader who manipulates them both to get the American Dream
all 3 of them are amateurs trying to lead a criminal life style
cause all 3 of them are just personal trainers at a Gym in Miami and are obviously not career criminals
so it's very very funny film every scene is Hillarious
especially Dwayne Johnson's character who is brainwashed by spirituality, Jesus, God etc
trying to run a criminal enterprise and at the same time he's sniffin tons of cocaine
and Mark's character Daniel manipulates him with his beliefs
Rob corddry is in the film aswell as Daniels boss at the Gym
and Rob's performance is fantastic, so funny
i'm not going to spoil the rest of the plot you have to watch the film.

the film goes for about 120mins, the funniest film i've seen all year
the blu-ray version has more special features than the DVD version
 about 1 hour of Behind the scenes footage, interviews with Mark, Dwayne, anthony, Michael bay
the producer and writer of the film etc
also there's Deleted scenes etc
the dvd version only has 1 featurette which i think is pointless
so your better buying the blu-ray version

Mark wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson performances are fantastic in the film
they both steal the whole film together
plus the screenplay is Really Good aswell as Michael bay's Directing of course
i gave it 5 star rating, definitely worth buying",1388620800,,2221,4.672634271099744

  This movie told the true story of horrifying & sickening events in the way I prefer - drama/comedy... I say this because I don't like to see gory scenes in a dramatic manner; it's too heart wrenching!... I don't believe this movie trivialized the crimes of these men but instead candy-coated their crimes as a method of lessening the fear & sadness of the degree of evilness of criminally minded people...
  The racially degrading references to Black & Colombian men should have been omitted; I didn't care for them at all...
  Other than that, this was an excellent movie... It ended well, except all involved should have been sentenced to death or life...
  Viewers have stated that they cannot believe the degree of stupidity of the personal trainers, but I can... My disbelief lies in the fact that the victim survived and walked away from a car-crash, car explosion & being rolled over by a car...
  I'm glad he survived and am sorry the other two victims didn't have the same fate...
  I wonder if he ceased bragging about his wealth.

Even if the pool was empty, they'd still be drowning in stupid.  And you gotta give Florida credit; NO one does crazy like Florida.

Mark Wahlberg as Chief Crazy in Charge just nailed it.  If you loved Wahlberg in The Other Guys, he brings the funny here too, while still playing the positive-thinking psycho-killer.  Even rewound a couple times just to watch his face as he ripped some major snappy dialogue.  Part of what makes Wahlberg funny is his flow and patience to wait for *just* the right beat to make his move.  He doesn't tell jokes or do schtick, thank god.  He just convinces us he's completely unaware that what he's saying is hilarious.

Anthony Mackie brings his own special crazy, especially at the strip-club bar when he's tripping on just how big he's gonna get in that gym:  Ima get SWOLE!  Ima have to turn SIDEways and shiat just to walk through tha door!!.  Because Dwayne Johnson played the guy who was Christian with still a tiny bit of conscience while snorting dumpsters full of coke, he had to tone down his funny from what we saw in The Other Guys, and only once do we get to see him do that blazing adorable full-faced smile of his.

Of special note is Emily Rutherfurd who all-too-briefly played Ed Harris' wife.  That kind of wicked-smart and wicked-cool makes her wicked-funny.  We desperately need more nuanced female roles like this and the actresses who can handle it.  Ken Jeong as the slimy, cliched motivational speaker was the perfect choice.  Jeong can work a crowd like nobody's business.

The trial highlights narrated by Ed Harris will leave you utterly gobsmacked and Googling for more details of the real criminals, their real crimes and their real trial.",1387411200,,1863,4.747663551401869

Of course P&G is a different movie with locations and crime differences. The all star cast is great, and the telling is far more from the side of the crooks.

There has been criticism that the movie makes light of the subject because it is a comedy.  That underestimates comedy's power.  Was Dr Stragelove making light of the cold war, and nuclear deterrence?

Peter Stormare is in both movies.",1386720000,,756,4.597014925373134

It was advertised as a comedy but isn't funny. But somehow it's really a not drama either. The plot isn't compelling and none of the characters are developed enough to be minimally interesting or compelling. Basically an incoherent, rambling, frustrating film.

This is the worst Michael Bay film ever. Even Transformers 2, Pearl Harbor, and Armageddon are better. And Bay has publicly apologised for Armageddon. What does that tell you about Pain and Gain? Maybe to expect an apology while doing press for Transformers 4?

It you want to calibrate my Michael Bay appreciation scale compared to yours. I like Bad Boys, The Rock, The Island, Transformers 1 and Transformers 3.",1385769600,,815,4.732394366197183

5535766,5,B00AZKY0OW,"Was just reading some of the other reviews posted and I am wondering if the average movie goer has been so dumbed down that they need drool cups and passes for the short bus. Before I go on to RAVE about this movie let me state a few relevant facts.
-I USUALLY HATE NEW MOVIES AND HAVE BEEN TO THE THEATER TWICE IN FIVE YEARS.
- I also DESPISE Michael Bay usually with his all action no cerebral films
That being said, this movie is FANTASTIC, one of my new favorites. The dialogue is fantastic and it works perfectly with the Rock and Wahlberg. Neither of these two are thespian geniuses so the utterly ridiculous lines (used to show just how dumb and over their heads these guys were) are delivered with straight deadpan deliveries which literally made me howl.
The characters, albeit pretty despicable are actually kind of likable and you find yourself rooting for them, not matter how heinous their actions are. They are just kind of big and stupid and somewhat lovable.
The pacing is utterly perfect, not too much action or downtime.
I liked the overall vibrant palate the movie was shot in, very Miami and sexy with a certain pastel overtone.
I GENUINELY THINK THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS MOVIE BAD REVIEWS DONT GET IT. How can you not like a movie whose deadpan delivered opening line is ""All my heroes are self made, Rocky, Scarface, all the guys from the Godfather""!!!!
On a side note, the movie really does have a certain motivational side to it. Yes the main characters are basically bags of rocks, but they hold such firm convictions on success, it kind of psyches yoiu up.
I really do recommend this film as you will rarely see a movie where peoples body parts are being cut off under the guise of twisted humor.
Oh not to mention it is based on a true story. This movie is a trip, a thrill ride of sheer pleasure.",1384646400,,1824,4.4640718562874255
5535767,3,B00AZKY0OW,"This movie is based off a real life story, (loosely that is). It is definitely worth a rent as some of the actual things that happened in real life are the things you would think they filled in to make the story better. The acting is actually not bad for these 3 guys and I really liked the ""Rock's"" performance. If you like action movies with a true to life aspect than try it out. Who knows you may actually like it enough to buy. It's a great movie to rent on a Sat. night.

5535887,1,B00AZKY0OW,"My friend put this in the running against ""Gangster Squad"" and ""Savages"" for worst movie of 2013.  I was so pissed that he won.

Michael Bay has a gift for discovering, creating and pooping bad fiction, but now he's achieved bad nonfiction. Feeling they're owed a more glamorous life, some bodybuilders unintelligibly concoct a plan to steal from the rich and give to themselves. Mr. Bay thought that this story reflected America: We're an entitled, self-obsessed goliath that doesn't seem to care who gets trampled as we claim our desires. It's an adequate concept farted out through a jumble of painfully bright cinematography, glistening muscles, and detestable characters. I don't think Michael Bay realizes that all this movie represents is a perfect analogy for his art and craft as a filmmaker.

You think you're tough? Try to watch the whole thing. I'm a titan of strength and endurance for finishing this. A turd was welcomed into the DVD case upon return, and the Redbox said, ""Thanks mate, that's MUCH better.""",1381622400,2,1021,4.9941176470588236

THROW THAT OUT THE DOOR!
Wahlburg is a type-cast actor. In ""The Shooter"" - also horrendously violent  - but on a much different plain - he was beyond superb. He was portraying a role.
This, is just gratuitous filth!
Marky Mark just being Marky Mark - even down to the swagger - oh, and by the way - that ""ain't"" all muscle!

5535911,5,B00AZKY0OW,"This is by far the best film Michael Bay has ever made. Its a dark comedy about a trio of very stupid criminals whose can-do attitude brings them success for a while. Its good at capturing the absurd values at play in modern American and the very messed up forms they can take. Its based loosely on a true story and there are all kinds of ""that can't possibly have happened"" moments that turn out to be rather close to the truth.

Its only flaw its that its a little too long. It also tries too hard to make one of the victims the subject of empathy. Even to the point of giving him an absurdist personal revenge moment. The story would work better with the victim being an awful person for whom nobody has much of any sympathy. Having him be tough is enough. We don't have to like him.

Its not a film for the mass audience or (in particular) the regular Michael Bay audience. But it is very well done.

The acting is exceptional. Mark Wahlberg carrys the film very well with his narration and is very convincing as an idiot can-do bodybuilder. I think this is probably the best work Dwayne Johnson has done as an actor.

Its one of the better serious films of the year. I hope Michael Bay does more work like this.",1381104000,3,1216,4.273913043478261

There was more sexual scenes/nudity than I had anticipated but thats what happens when you don't really read why its R rated. Overall I guess the movie just was not up to my expectations.

I was worried at first, but once the plot started to roll the movie was actually done very well and kept my interest. Bay surprised me here. This is more of a comedy than the actual events suggested, but the movie doesn't forget that there is a sad, lonely undertone to this chilling story. Some parts were ridiculous, some funny, some dark and tense, but luckily Bay was able to hold the story together. In a way, I think the over the top humor made the movie more heartbreaking. Mind you, the movie never falls into one category other than humor and crime mixed together, if you want a straight crime flick this isn't it, nor a straight up comedy to me. It's a balance of the two. If interested, watch the 48 Hour Mystery episode on the real story at 48 Mystery.com. It was from last season.",1379289600,,878,4.392638036809816
5536133,4,B00AZKY0OW,"*This is not Elsbeth Chapman, this is her son's review.*

This movie was loosely based on the true story, but was well directed and produced. Michael Bay does a good job of putting you into the minds of the characters of the movie. Throughout the movie characters say what they are thinking randomly, but in a good way that compliments the story. Dywane Johnson's role is actually 3 or 4 people compiled into one, why I don't know, but plays as Paul Doyle, who had a more major role than the other men in the gang. The movie has a darker comedy, which to me made the story a little less ""depressing"" but at the end of the movie it switches to a serious tone and makes a good closure. Mark Wahlberg really does a great job portraying Danny Lugo. Danny Lugo was supposed to be a manipulative person, and Mark's acting nailed it on the head. Anthony Mackie played Noel ""Adrian"" Doorbal, who was Danny Lugo's right hand man and best friend, but also didn't like being ordered around by Danny. This caused funny arguments throughout the movie. Mackie also did a great job acting. I might say this is Mark's and Mackie's best performances yet. Since Johnson's character is a compilation of 3, it is hard to say how well he portrayed them, but playing as Paul Doyle, Johnson did a good job playing a god-fearing cocaine addict. This movie tells a story about something that really happened, which apparently people hadn't heard of. I feel this movie didn't have a chance as people didn't really understand what Michael Bay was trying to do, which was tell a unbelievable true story, with a little comedy.

Acting-5/5

Story-3/5 (The movie story was good, but they shouldn't have changed some of the minor details and stayed a little more true to the story.)

Camera work-4/5 (The camera work stood out to me in this movie enough for me to notice it and appreciate it.)

Music-5/5 (I forgot to write about this, but the sound track really added to the movie and was probably one of my favorite things about the movie.)

All in all I thought this was a cleverly written movie with a great soundtrack and acting skills. It could have been a little truer, but I ""enjoyed"" the story. This movie is worth at least renting to watch once and if you enjoyed it like me, coming back to amazon to buy it.",1379289600,,2286,4.4963855421686745

They say most psychopaths tend to live there because they crave excitement.

It was 30 minutes longer than your average American movie and the added time did nothing to make it better.  You have these three musclemen, but they NEVER show any male nudity.

Ironically, some of the attributes of the main character, played by Mark Wahlberg, made it even harder to handle some of these misfit, criminals actions. He, the character he played, was kind of likeable and in his own mind everything he did, illegal or not, was okay. That made some of the things he did even more difficult to take.

Bringing the Rock into the mix he plans to assume all the assets of his d-bag client, Monk.  The 'plan' degenerates as one would assume.

This is such a fun summer movie that's quite colorful. Set in Miami in the mid 90s. I loved it - easily one of the better films starring Mark Walberg & Dwayne Johnson recently IMO. Ed Harris does a nice job playing an investigator. So many great scenes with the ""Rock"" (who looks huge here). It's really funny in places. Fast cars, a fast boat, guns, stun guns, dildos, a cheap electric chainsaw, an axe, a barbecue grill, strippers, drugs, murder, theft, a wedding, a ninja costume, a bloody toe, and fitness!

Mostly the former, but it might have become more the latter as well. The main character, played by Wahlberg, is stupid and vicious (in the old sense of full of vice) and as the film continued we looked at each other & said ""Is this really worth losing two hours of our lives""? The answer was a resounding no. We turned to the episode of Breaking Bad we're watching. Is Jesse in BB stupid & vicious? Well, yes.

 It's based on a true story, workout guys in Florida get caught up in an extortion ring and a kidnapping scheme that goes terribly wrong.  Opportunist, doing whatever it takes to stay ahead of the game, keep getting in jams, and don't really think it thru, kind of crash thru the problem clumsily.

I will say this about Michael Bay, I'm not a fan of his, but I was of him here, and it's probably because he was trying to make a lol hilarious movie, and it came out this way instead, dark comedy drama, that's why I like it.

Just see the movie, don't read the other negative reviews.",1378512000,,721,4.343283582089552
5536401,3,B00AZKY0OW,"""A film of allsorts and certainly one to surprise. While never officially on my radar, Pain & Gain, directed by the notoriously hated filmmaker Michael Bay, revamps a bizarre true story about Miami crime, sex, drugs, and bodybuilding to something surprisingly intriguing, hilarious, outlandish, and frankly disturbing.

While this might offend some of more established film reviewers, I personally thought the opening scene with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) exercising and running from the police in slow-motion and on a GoPro HD camera was pure cinematic gold that I could even jump off my chair and dance. In addition, much of the witty dialogue and banter between Wahlberg's psychopathic lust for greed alerts to an audience of how convincing ""crazy"" can be when you know you have so little yet you want to show so much. Dwayne Johnson provides an excellently bizarre, hilarious performance as Paul, a born-again Christian turned vigilante after trying to benefit Lugo's vicious schemes and a comical performance from Anthony Mackie as Adrian and Rebel Wilson playing his perverted admirer/wife as they try to overcome ""impotence.""

The film, while inspired by real events and witnessed through a testimonial and confessional lens, should not be taken seriously! As a whole, the film works much like a Guy Ritchie film on drugs amped for American audiences with the stop-and-start talking and gruesome, graphic violence found in a Quentin Tarantino dark comedy. What Bay has created was a film, unlike the Transformers films, that is believable, relatable, and unsettling all at once to where the criminality being sensationalised is now seen as fictional entertainment and make-believe. His knackery for cinematography, electronic dance music and hip-hop (including a clever use of Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise), 1990s kitsch (especially big phones and pompous scene design), and action is all there and it did not disappoint too much in dark crime comedies like RocknRolla (a Guy Ritchie film which was legitimately terrible) or Nobel Son (one of the worst thrillers made in recent memory) but more like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Layer Cake, Reservoir Dogs, and In Bruges.

While he is often mentioned as commercialistic, soulless, and politically incorrect, this film only amps much of this idea of him as an idiot when in actuality, the film was rather smartly done despite its bad press and very inappropriate take on real events. As some people claim this film was a parody or satire on Michael Bay's filmmaking, the perceivable self-mockery or deprecation of the whole two hours and nine minutes (which, in my opinion, went for too long and the film is better seen in small doses than as a whole) is probably better than if it was all the way serious for it won't make it stand out. Well, I would not recommend it entirely but after sheer boredom, why not pop this on just no pumping iron here for it contradicts the point.""",1378425600,,2944,5.091097308488613

First, there is NOTHING at all hilarious about this movie and it is a stretch even calling it a comedy. There is very little to like about this movie, the three main characters (The Rock, Mackie and Markie Mark) are totally unlikable moronic meatheads and you spend the whole movie hoping they get caught, the victim (Shalhoub) is totally unlikable and you're sort of glad he is victimized, the ex-cop/investigator (Harris) is totally unlikable and the eye candy bimbo (Paly) while very hot can't act and is ridiculously unlikable as well. It's a movie where you basically dislike every character in it.  There is an occasional humorous moment (like blindfolding Shalhoub with womens panty liners) but they are extremely rare. It's a typical Michael Bay movie, way too heavy on the color, silly close ups and shoddy direction.

There is nothing to like about this movie, in fact I found the best part to be the ending credits when they actually showed pictures of the real gang (there were more than three and the Rock's movie character is a fictionalized conglomerate of a bunch of actual people) and their victims.

Also the two people that were killed were not killed by accident as the movie suggests. They were brutally killed by these psychopaths. There really wasn't much to like about the real Lugo and his gang so I don't see why Michael Bay found these guys worth sympathising with.

When I say loosely based, it is just that, it is more fiction than true life.  Although the real characters seem to be about as bad and dumb as the story here.

This movie tries to be several things and none of them well.  Is it an action movie, a drama, a comedy..well there are scenes that make you think it is going to be one of those then veers off in another direction, like a steroid-ed up WWF wrestler.  The comedy isn't funny, the drama is lost in its lack of story-telling and the action is lost in its brutality.  The bloody scenes are just way too much with a lack of any character development to make you care about any of the players involved.

I was trying to picture the writers sitting around and coming up with such a ludicrous storyline, but then I remembered: oh, yeah, this is a true story. That said, this true story could have been told many ways, but it is done in a dark humor kind of way. I don't even MIND that (I like dark humor), but this film (with actors I enjoy) was just beyond weird.

This is the kind of movie that in a way is so bad that some people may have to see it again. There was one scene where Dwayne Johnson is flipping dismembered hands on a grill (to get off fingerprints), the way someone would tend to hamburgers at a barbecue. That is one of the points in the film where I was laughing so hysterically because I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

And it wasn't comedic funny - it was a more ""that's just odd"" sort of stifled laugh.  Many parts of of were reminiscent of another Bay film, Bad Boys 2.

Overall, not a terrific movie, and not even a recent favorite.  I typically rate movies on two criteria - do I want my time and/or money back.  Do I want my time back - no, it was an all right watch.

5536650,3,B00AZKY0OW,"Director Michael Bay pulls a fast one on us and actually makes a pretty decent movie.  He changes things up with this ""based on a true story"" dark comedy.  It might have been even funnier if some of this wasn't true.  Set in Miami, three knuckleheads, stereotypical muscle-bound gym rats all, decide that to advance in the material world, they should kidnap a wealthy owner of a sandwich franchise.

Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a naturalized citizen coming from South America and likely has underworld connections.  In any case he keeps most of his money offshore.  He is a very unlikeable character, always demeaning others.  Daniel (Mark Wahlberg) is the ""brains"" of the trio looking to get Victor's dough.  He's actually sociable and manages to increase the membership of a health club owned by John (Rob Corddry).  But that isn't enough.  He's worked hard but is still short of his goal.  He wants more money.  When Victor becomes a client, kidnapping and ransom seems like the right course of action.  Helping him is his testosterone-addled best friend Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul, a loveable ex-con played with a soft emotional side by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.

Things become complicated, but after a long series of torture methods, Victor gives Daniel the codes needed to get the money.  He basically signs away all his property and Daniel just moves into Victor's house.  When Victor recognizes Daniel's voice, the hapless trio decide they must kill Victor.  They try.  Several times.  Victor somehow manages to survive each time.  Ed Harris is along for the ride as a retired detective, hired by Victor to get the goods on Daniel and his cohorts.

I found the film reasonably entertaining, finding the himbos fun to watch.  The film does have an amped up tone of violence, especially against Shalhoub's character.  He's such an unlikeable character however, we are almost happy to see it.  And Miami must have the only police department that shoots at unarmed, running suspects.

The Blu ray disc is a winner.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The various colors of Miami really pop in this film.  Awash in pastels and bright whites, the film really sparkles.  Both exterior and some dark, dirty, bloody interiors work well on screen.  Excellent detail shows sweat, beards and splattered blood with great clarity.  The disc comes with an exhilarating Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless track.  The subs are in action, particularly when the scene shifts to a strip club.  The kind that advertises ""totally nude"" but none of the performers are even partially nude.  I digress.  The overall audio offers excellent clarity throughout the film.  The softer ambient sounds are as good as the immersive gun battles.  Subtitles come in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are no extras.",1377907200,,2836,4.980769230769231

I think the movie tries a bit too hard with the dark humor jokes. Now I like dark humor but trying to make a guy get run over several times funny, just isn't tasteful in my opinion. The fact they are running him over isn't even the worst part, just the way they show it, it gets kinda detailed, in my opinion. This is just one of a few things I noticed, just the first one to popped in my head.

The story is an interesting one, and if you haven't read the full story of it online, you should. I did after I saw the movie and it makes you appreciate the movie a bit more. The fact that Bay actually turned down the amount of violence is kind of surprised, because of how violent this movie is. But, when you read the story, you see how much worse it should of been.

I think with what Bay had to work with, this is the best it could of been, I honestly don't think you could of made this story better, the problem is, no matter how good/great of a writer you are, if you don't have a good story to work with, it can never be that great in the end. I think that's the problem with this movie. It's kind of funny in a dumb way on paper that you are fine with reading once, but to put on a movie where you would watch it multiple times, I am not so sure.

The guys do their best but the storyline sucked,1377388800,,410,4.256410256410256
5536834,1,B00AZKY0OW,"Let's get this straight: this movie is based on a true story.  I'm not sure how accurately (I'm guessing not very), but yes, this actually happened: a ""gang"" of bodybuilders decides to kidnap and torture a businessman, solely because he's a jerk and they feel entitled to some of his money.  Apparently, someone in Hollywood heard this story and thought, ""Hey, that'd make a great movie, but let's make the kidnappers the good guys and the victim the bad guy.""

There's no ironic tongue-in-cheek, Coen Brothers shtick going on here.  Oh, Michael Bay attempts it; he's going for Coen cold, but at his BEST, he's hitting LADY KILLERS (more on that in a minute), and straying far from FARGO or BURN AFTER READING.  In fact, he's not even in the same ballpark.  There's no, ""Take it with a grain of salt.""  You can't even fall back on this just being fiction.  You're actually supposed to root for these lunkheads, because they're ""everymen"" and they only want ""a better life"" (which involves driving over an innocent guy's face with a truck).  As the lead, Mark Wahlberg seems to be in an entirely different movie.  It's not his fault; he's given some awkward performances, but he's given us enough gold to tell when he's trying, and when he's struggling with the material.  Ed Harris gives a reliably solid late-act supporting turn, and Tony Shalhoub does his Tony Shalhoub thing.

Where the movie almost hits its stride is with Dwayne Johnson.  His born-again murderous thug Paul Doyle is totally out of place with the rest of the film; what the writers got wrong everywhere else, they got right with Doyle, and Johnson has the comedic timing to pull off the part.  That being said...how sad is it that the best thing about your film is The Rock?  This is the first movie that truly offended me, in its utter ignorance and desire to pander to baser instincts (and this is coming from a guy who thinks the SCARY MOVIE franchise is still entertaining).  I can truly say I wish I hadn't seen this movie.  But then again...there's a lesson in how NOT to make a movie here.  Bay isn't necessarily a bad filmmaker; he's given us some great pieces of modern shlock entertainment, which critics dismiss but in reality serves a real purpose.  But Bay is trying to pull off a semi-Oscar hat trick here; he's walking into Coen territory and finding out he's floundering in the deep end of the pool.  The film is sexist; the film presents us with gratuitous violence because the filmmakers feel the audience is dumb enough to buy it.  I won't say PAIN & GAIN is a total waste of time; that's a highly subjective stance (even more so than, say, an online review).  But I can tell you straight up that I wish I hadn't seen it.  I can also point out that, in 15 years, this is only the second one-star review I've given.  So take that how you will.",1377388800,4,2832,4.562376237623762
5536835,3,B00AZKY0OW,"Michael Bay is not the most popular of filmmakers. In fact he is probably one of the most critically loathed. Although I did enjoy the first Transformers movie a bit, I am not generally a fan of his films, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor etc. In addition, I usually don't like The Rock in anything he does, but found his change of character in this movie to be somewhat enjoyable.

Dating the film to mid-nineties helped it's appeal, Miami is so often seen in the light of the eighties this made for another interesting change of pace.

5536852,3,B00AZKY0OW,"this movie is, fundamentally, a botched job. the middling 3 star rating is a compromise between five star visuals and acting, and a one star directorial stance on the subject.

taken as a movie about clowns -- the three clowns at the center of the narrative -- ""pain and gain"" is zesty and often flat out hilarious. as a true story, it is flabbergasting. as a piece of cinema, it ransacks from tony scott's script, camera, editing and postprocessing tricks (""domino"") to create a snappy, saturated and hectic storytelling style, full of flashbacks and self presentation monologues. the four pivotal actors -- wahlberg, jackie, johnson and shaloub -- deliver deadpan and very funny characterizations of stupid people striving with stupid values, and the script is full of rapid fire comic one liners (""i've seen lots of movies, i know what i'm doing.""). wahlberg invested a lot of sweat pumping himself up to near steroid dimensions, he and dwayne johnson are skilled comedians; rebel wilson and ed harris stand out in secondary roles.

the problems arise in the script and in the treatment of the script. although this is supposedly a ""true story"" (tick toc date and time stamps, and the subtitle ""this is still a true story!"" remind us of that), the script creates a fictional or composite character (played by johnson), so we have as it were two real people conspiring crimes with an imaginary playmate. was there anyone involved with the plot who was a jesus freak, punched out a priest, lost his toe in a botched robbery? did he really scam a christian gun salesman, or punch out a kidnap victim, or barbecue severed hands to eliminate fingerprints? we can't be sure. a secondary problem is that the movie is over two hours long: it's asking a lot from one liners and snappy visuals to sustain a viewer's interest that long, but a lot of the length is in jokes that are entirely expendable. for example: the three minute scene in the strip joint, where mackie extols the virtues of a ""steroid milkshake"" (breast milk and HGH) is funny, i guess, but really who cares?

fictional elements usually give a director the freedom to shape the story in pursuit of a coherent interpretation or style ... but there is quite a lot of graphic gore and human pain, including torture and two clumsy murders, that knock the style off kilter. it's possible to present murder as comedy in a film -- see kubrick's ""lolita"" or the coen's ""blood simple"", for example -- but the violence shown here breaks through the comic pretense and is frankly disturbing. the scene where johnson punches out inmates in a prison yard is funny; the scene where he runs over a kidnap victim with a van is not. the characters morph from comically shallow and grandiose to pathetically sadistic and greedy ... and you can't, in a single film, have it both ways. once we're put on our guard as to whether it's ""OK"" to laugh or not, the film loses its ability to draw us into its world. we're just gawkers at gore and grief and embarrassed that we ever thought it was something to laugh at.",1377129600,,3054,4.6940298507462686

5536877,4,B00AZKY0OW,"If you grew up in someplace normal, like Toronto or Boise, you might think that Pain  & Gain is one of those Carl Hiaasen takes on South Florida where the crooks are too stupid to live or perhaps an Elmore Leonard portrait of a fictional loan shark like Chili Palmer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Shorty/dp/B002WBZD02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Shorty</a>).

On the other hand if you grew up and came to age in South Florida you will immediately know that there really is a private eye named Ed Dubois. For that matter there really is a Chili Palmer, although he too is a private eye and is not nor has ever been a loan shark. I know both Ed and Ernie ""Chili"" Palmer, and for that matter I have known Carl for 40 years. Carl just writes fiction about stupid or outrageous South Floridians, while Ed Dubois furnished a story to a writer about one of his strangest cases and it ended up in a Mark Wahlberg. feature. So in other words, Pain & Gain is pretty much a true story about some bodybuilders with more ambition than brains and more muscles than luck.us

So Ed Dubois, the private dick who recounted the tale to a writer, gets portrayed by Ed Harris which is almost as cool as John Travolta getting cast as Chili. the film is shot all over town, with the courtroom scenes taking place in the ceremonial courtroom in the United States District Court, which is truly one of the most photogenic places to begin a stretch in the can, just as Manuel Noreiga who was convicted right there.

5536902,1,B00AZKY0OW,"This is arguably the worst Michael Bay movie made to date and quite possibly the worst ""based on real events"" movie adaptation ever.  I've never been to a film where the theater audience vociferously ""BOOED"" out loud afterwards, until I saw this film. I believe the actors played their roles as directed, but the atrocious dialogue, the choppiness of the movie, and the over the top violence & cursing made it unbearable to watch.  I went in having knowledge of the original story after reading about it and having watched the TV documentary on ABC's ""Revenge for Real"" so I was looking forward to this film, especially since Mark Walberg & the Rock were starring in it. They took the basic premise of the story, flipped it on it's head to turn it into a twisted black comedy. They then proceeded to make the victim who was a self made millionaire out to be an obnoxiously rich head case who constantly boasted about how rich he was that would make almost anybody want to beat the tar out of him and take all his money. And they wrote out one of the primary characters, Jorge Delgado, the one who actually worked for Victor Kershaw.  He was the one who worked out at the Gym and got in with Danny Lugo.  Then they had the gall to keep saying throughout the film, ""This is a true story.""  It faintly resembled the basic events of the story, but changed everything else.  About half way through I almost walked out it was so awful, but stayed thinking that it might get better.  Unfortunately, it only got progressively worse. The movie is over 2 hours long and felt every bit like 4. Well, at least they got the title right.  The paying audience's 'PAIN' was the movie maker's 'Gain'.  This movie belongs in the trash heap of ""Worst movies ever made with big name actors.""  If this movie earned anything, it deserves a Razzie for ""Worst film of the year.""

5536903,4,B00AZKY0OW,"I watched this with some friends only by group decision but ended up liking the movie. Obviously the real-life story is bizarre and just plain sick, but as a movie it was entertaining and I thought pretty funny for a Bay film (especially Johnson, oddly enough). Maybe I found it funny because meatheads are amusing to me. It definitely reminded me of something akin to, say, Goodfellas. Most likely it was the gratuitous violence and greed. I never heard of the story that P&G was based on, but the film makes no qualms about the fact it is based on ""real life"", even ""calling it out"" during the film and during the credits. Obviously the real life story is not so funny, but as a jumping board for a movie, it apparently made quality inspiration due to its preposterousness.

As some have ranted about its accuracy, Hollywood will not and cannot ever accurately depict ""real"" life in a film. So I wouldn't give the storyline 4 out of 10 stars for ""trueness"". Personally, I am more cautious about Hollywood ""historical"" films which parade as documentaries and, hence, to me read as potentially misleading propaganda: Pearl Harbor, WTC or Zero Dark Thirty.

In any case, I say it's one of Bay's best films since I wasn't totally distracted by conspicuous luxury product placement and an assault of American car advertising per the norm in his films. NOT that there wasn't his usual car-oriented, yuppy product placements, but for whatever reasons I wasn't annoyed or ""taken out of the moment"" or even remember them. Call it ""subtlety"" for Michael Bay (although he may see that as a failure).

The story was a pretty good mainstream, darkish-comedy. So Kudos to Bay on this effort. It's the first time I haven't had to say, ""God, that was such a cheesy, stupid line...""  or ""Enough with the advertising!"" in one of his films.",1375142400,,1823,4.723270440251572

5536906,1,B00AZKY0OW,"This movie is all
PAIN
and no gain. Soon after this movie began, I felt like a weight machine just knocked the air out of me at the gym, leaving me breathless. And this feeling just compounded throughout the overly long length of this extremely bad film.

I went to see this film solely because of the recent work of Mark Wahlberg. He has developed into a fine actor, who makes some pretty good films which benefit from his presence; his quiet intensity brings a certain amount of realism to the film and make them more watchable. He is also using his clout within Hollywood to produce some interesting, intriguing films, most notably ""The Fighter"" and well-regarded cable-fare like ""Boardwalk Empire"". But even B movies like ""Ted"", ""Contraband"" and ""Broken City"" are more watchable because of him. When I tell people I recently saw a Wahlberg film, they usually wrinkle their nose, and I find myself defending him, extolling the virtues of each of his films.

But that is ending as of today.
""Pain
and Gain"", the new `comedy' based on a true story from director Michael Bay (""Armageddon"", ""Transformers 1 through the upcoming 4"") is mind-numbingly bad.

Bay is ridiculed for the films that made him famous, films like ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", ""Transformers"", films in which special effects are more important than the actors, explosions are more commonplace than expository dialogue and an edit happens every two seconds. So it seems odd that he would take on the story of three bodybuilders who decide to extort a sleazy Florida businessman for everything he has. Odder yet, it is intended to be a comedy. On the surface, an explosion and car-chase- free film. But it should come as no surprise that Bay manages to work some of these elements into this story. Apparently, he was unable to cut the cord completely.

There are so, so many things wrong with
""Pain
and Gain"" it is difficult to point them all out. At one point, Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) tells his potential boss that he can bench-press 400 pounds. I'll concentrate on four of the many bad things about this film, one for each 100 pounds Danny lifts. I know, random but lets go with it.

The most distracting thing is the constant shifting narration. From the moment the film begins, many characters narrate the film, telling us their thoughts, their histories, their motives. The film begins with Ed Harris addressing us, yet he isn't in the film until about 45 minutes later. Then, we hear Mark Wahlberg. Then, Dwayne Johnson (as he prefers now, but he'll always be The Rock to us) before we go back to Wahlberg and so on. This is a filmmaking technique most commonly used in mysteries and sometimes dramatic stories when it is necessary to learn what a particular character is thinking. Generally, if narration is used, it is the voice of one character, a central character, designed to illuminate some difficult-to-illustrate emotion or problem. In
""Pain"",
because the narration shifts back and forth, it isn't clear what we are supposed to learn from it. Let's face it, these characters are pretty stupid, which is part of the intended comedy, so the caper they try to pull off is not that complicated. It isn't necessary to guide us through the `complicated' narrative. If David Mamet were the writer and director of the film, the narration might be necessary and welcome, but this is not a David Mamet film. On so many levels.

The narration does nothing to establish a POV, something
""Pain""
could really use. Presumably, the POV should be Danny Lugo, and you would expect it to come from him. But because it shifts back and forth, the narration becomes
PAIN-
ful and distracts you from following his story. But he is who we should be following, so why do the shifting narration?

Stupid people aren't funny simply because they are stupid. But in
""Pain"",
that seems to be the conceit. The characters played by Wahlberg, The Rock, and to a lesser extent simply because he has less screen time, Anthony Mackie, are all dumb as door nails. Yet, nothing they do is funny. In fact, a lot of their actions are kind of horrible. Where are the laughs supposed to come from? This trio is supposed to be a newer generation Three Stooges. And the Stooges are pretty stupid as well. But their stuff is funny because it is elaborately choreographed slapstick. And while their actions caused pain,
it caused
pain
for them, not others. In
""Pain"",
the actions of these three bodybuilders cause
pain
to others, somewhat horrible, never funny
pain.

Danny wants to kidnap one of his clients, a scuzzy local businessman (Tony Shaloub) and force him to sign over all of his money and property before they release him. The plan will work perfectly because they will wear masks and Danny has ""seen a lot of movies"". Of course, the plan doesn't go well and they have to make a lot of decisions on the fly, decisions which will not have the outcome they expect. A lot of people get hurt, some people die. It just isn't funny.

But you also have to ask why Danny picks out this scuzzy businessman. Is it because he is annoying? Because he is, but Is that really enough reason to kidnap him and steal everything he has? If this is the sole reason, I can think of at least a dozen people that would be better targets. Heck, many of my readers probably would single me out on occasion. There isn't enough motive for him to target this individual. And when the plan starts to go wrong, he certainly doesn't deserve the treatment he receives.

Michael Bay is best known for his testosterone-fueled, male-heavy action films. He is also the director of ""Bad Boys"", two films featuring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as cops in Miami who have to solve cases. These films are very similar and Bay clearly wants
""Pain""
to be a sort of ""Bad Boys 3""; all three films are based in Miami, men drive expensive sports cars, the camera lingers on and fetishizes females in bathing suits, the landscape is colored by a hazy, deep sunset. But Wahlberg, The Rock and Mackie are not comedians and simply can't extract anything out this material that is remotely funny.

The last problem with
""Pain"",
the last one we will discuss anyway, is that there is simply no one in the story that is the least bit likable. Every single character is mean, stupid, looking out for themselves, violent, a criminal, stupid and mean. Yes, I know I repeated stupid and mean, but there are a lot of characters in the film who are both so it was worth mentioning a second time. Most films have to have at least one likable character, to allow us into the story and to become a part of the narrative. Without it, we stand back from the action, watching it with disinterested passion. Without this likable character, it is a bit like watching high schoolers putting on a bad play. Nothing connects.

There are a lot of problems with
""Pain"".
Nothing works. The acting is atrocious. The story is alienating. The cinematography looks grubby. Bay seems like he would rather be directing an action film. The Rock's performance is all over the place and unconvincing. And the list goes on.

""Pain
and Gain"" is just that. All
pain
and no gain.

Well that was fun. Going into Pain & Gain I didn't really have any expectations. This was mainly because I knew very little about the film beyond the basic premise of three men robbing other, very wealthy, men who didn't ""deserve"" their financial success. I was also unaware that this was based on a true story. Now there's no doubt in my mind that a lot of flare was added to make this more enjoyable from a cinematic standpoint, but to deny that Pain & Gain was a blast would be downright blasphemous.

Pain & Gain's main character, if I had to pick one, would probably be Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg). He's the one who comes up with the idea and Adrian ""Noel"" Dorbal (Anthony Mackie) and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) just agree to tag along in hopes of creating a better life for themselves. Daniel and Adrian are both fitness trainers working for Sun Gym. One day Daniel gets a new client by the name of Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) who starts telling Daniel his life story and how he's so rich, yada yada yada.

Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo creates a scheme to rob this man who he believes is a crook. The only thing is he doesn't just want to rob him, he wants to destroy him and leave him with nothing. He convinces Adrian to help him out and when ex-convict Paul comes looking for a job at the gym, he convinces him too. So once they have the crew together the rest of the film is a joyride as you follow these three different men through an extremely insane story filled with theft, murder, cocaine, and strippers.

I know what you're thinking, ""Well what's so different about that?"" True, we've seen movies like this before, but what we haven't seen are characters like these. I have yet to go too deep into the differences between the movie and reality, but the biggest one I've seen so far is that Dwayne's character is the product of multiple men. Meaning they took bits and pieces of four different men and created Paul. Normally an inaccuracy like this would be irritating to someone like me, but I find it hard to find too much fault in it when the execution was so flawless. Paul is perhaps one of the funniest characters we've seen since Alan from the original Hangover film. He's this huge, terrifying man on the outside, but inside he's this sweetheart trying to move on from his past.

Then there's Lugo. The man who just wants to make a quick buck because he's tired of struggling through life. He's tired of doing the same thing day after day because no matter how good he looks he can't get a woman without sufficient income. He expects this to be an easy job. Kidnap Kershaw, get him to sign some papers, and drop him off somewhere. What he doesn't expect is Kershaw to put up a struggle because it takes a good month before he finally cracks. Daniel's probably one of the more grounded characters out of the entire cast. All he wants is to live a comfortable life, but he just can't seem to get ahead. His biggest issue is that he always wants to take shortcuts and that's what got him thrown in prison for fraud a few years back.

What made Pain & Gain so enjoyable, for me, is that beyond the characters and beyond the violence they managed to keep a lighthearted tone throughout majority of the film. Even when they were cutting people up with a chainsaw or barbecuing hands on the grill, there was always that splash of comedy that turned a gruesome scene into a funny one. It's one of those films that's a comedy without actually being a comedy. When you break it down, Pain & Gain is just another crime film, but the fact that they had me laughing throughout the entire film makes it hard for me not to label it a comedy.

Truthfully, as much as I enjoyed this movie, I do feel that it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Running at two hours and some change this is a long movie that starts to feel long in its final 20 minutes or so. Don't get me wrong, the laughs never stopped, but it did reach a point where I was like ""Is this really still going on? Are they really doing a second robbery?"" I know that this was all part of the actual story, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it started to lose some of its steam. There's only so much you can take before it starts to get old. Once it reaches that point you start to notice some things that just feel a little pointless and predictable.

If there's been a cast with this much chemistry in the past please let me know now because at this moment in time I can't think of any. You see these three men in the promotional posters and it honestly doesn't look right. They're three completely different men with three completely different personalities, but the same can be said about their characters and that's why this film works as well as it does. After the lackluster Broken City I'm glad to have another Wahlberg film I enjoy. He's kind of taken pieces of his previous roles and applied them all in here. So if you're a fan of Wahlberg expect to enjoy his performance here. Then Dwayne gave what's probably my favorite performance from him so far. He brought a lot of laughs and I really hope we get to see this side of him more often. Mackie, on the other hand, continues to solidify himself as one of those actors who keeps a solid performance throughout, but also one who has yet to reach his full potential.

There's a pretty diverse cast of characters ranging from really great to forgettable. You have Ed Harris as Detective Ed Du Bois, Ken Jeong as Johnny Wu, Rebel Wilson as Robin Peck (Adrian's love interest), Rob Corddry as Sun Gym owner John Mese, Bar Paly as Sorina Luminata (Paul's love interest), and Tony Shalhoub as Victor Kershaw. Just like the main cast, a lot of these characters are here for comedic effect. The only person who felt a little out of place was Rebel Wilson, but I think part of that was because she only received like two minutes of screen time. It just felt like her character didn't really add anything to the story. With that said, everyone involved did a great job.

Overall Score: 8/10 - There's bound to be many inaccuracies scattered throughout Pain & Gain and if I had known about the story prior to watching this I probably would have noticed them. Thankfully, I didn't and that's ok because Pain & Gain accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain. You don't always need huge special effects or an intelligent plot to create a good movie. Sometimes the characters and their respective actors can carry the film and Pain & Gain is one of those films. It definitely could've benefited from a shorter running time, but if that's my biggest complaint about the experience then they're ahead of the game. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies then go see this. It's not complex and it's not a visual masterpiece, it's just fun.",1369008000,,6862,4.447535771065183

Brief Synopsis:

Paul Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a personal trainer at a privately owned gym in Miami, Florida. He is young, motivated, and will do just about anything to live the ""American Dream"" or more plainly spoken, justify his sentiment of entitlement.

Despite Paul's criminal past as a schemer, we watch Paul reinvent himself as a successful trainer at a local gym. He appears he is good at what he does. Moreover, he manages to triple the gym membership in just 6 weeks. As a successful trainer though he still feels the way like most hardworking Americans do, not appreciated. One of his more wealthier clients, Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a self-made millionaire who seems to spend about as much time talking down to people as he did building his empire. Paul begins to take notice of his posh lifestyle and desires to have it whatever the cost. So what's the plan to achieve this lifestyle ? Forcibly kidnap him and drain his assets. Simple enough, but he realizes he can't do it by himself. The team is expanded to include Paul Doyle (Dwyane Johnson) who was a cocaine addicted convict but now turned evangelist Christian and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). The three stooges begin their quest for wealth and glory but only with short term success.

I'll start with the premise for the film. I found it hard to ignore that the film cannot help but to protect it's integrity by throwing mini disclaimers stating this is a true story. About an hour through the movie, we are reminded again with the subtitle, ""This is still a true story"". If this film was purely fictional it would be that much tougher to make this story into a motion picture film let alone retain an audience. But this is where the film tries to capitalize on the true story aspect. It is the ridiculousness and stupidity of reality that invokes a sense of awe and disbelief. People want to see what the next idiotic stunt these three ring ling circus brothers will produce next. It is obvious that we know where these criminals are going to end up but their amateur style is just enough to keep us watching. Why? Because it is true a story.

The execution was just poor. Granted that taking an odd and true life murder story and rendering it into a dark comedy requires some serious skill. However, Michael Bay failed miserably accomplishing this task. Maybe the budget just wasn't big enough, after all, 26 million dollars is how much Michael usually spends on a car crash stunt. After watching every gore scene end with some sort of twisted line of humor, I cringed. Films that tout themselves as being a true story usually throw a red flag for me; details are usually fabricated to the fullest extent, and in most cases the truth is extended as far as it is allowed to go, or at least make a profit.  In the real life story, people were kidnapped, tortured and murdered. I didn't find this aspect funny but actually sick and depraved. But this makes sense because our culture is sick and depraved to begin with. It is a perfect fit. The sheer idiocy of these criminals wasn't enough to distract me from the real life victims that suffered. I left the theater questioning our culture as a society.",1367712000,9,3471,4.625
5536927,5,B00AZKY0OW,"I know this was based on a true story, but once the idea was developed to be made into a motion picture the ""facts"" changed into script format and the story became ""fictionalize"". Therefore, as a comedy/action flick this film works perfectly fine. if at the end of the day people take this as what it is...a movie, then we can all agree that this is one of the most brilliantly executed films so far this decade. This can also be (all things consider) Michael Bay's most mature film from an artistic point of view.",1367712000,5,514,4.421052631578948
5536928,3,B00AZKY0OW,"This is a true story that reads like dumb crook news. Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a muscle headed body builder who is inspired in ironic fashion by unorthodox motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong). With the aid of two other body builders, Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) they devise a plan to kidnap and extort money from Colombian businessman Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub).

They fumble their way through the operation and become greedy. It is clear these guys were not bright. The writers created dialouge for these crooks in order to lighten the story and to keep them from looking like complete idiots. Fictional aspects such as making the nurse (Rebel Wilson) look heavy-set with portraying Doorbal as liking those type of women kept the story from becoming dry.

The beginning of the film demonstrates some humor as Danny names fictional characters as his heroes...""There are no shortcuts to the American dream"" he proclaims. In spite of the efforts made by the writers, the film somehow loses its hook and charm as you wait for it to end.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and nudity. Porn star Nikki Benz is one of the unnamed strippers.",1367712000,13,1183,4.934673366834171
