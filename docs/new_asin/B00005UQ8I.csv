7956001,4,B00005UQ8I,"I received this DVD as part of a 4 DVD set with Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker. This set is still available as of 15 April, 2012. What a nice surprise this Romeo and Juliet was for me. Avant-garde choreography, a dark, industrial type set, bold costumes and fine dancers add up to a wonderful performance. This is an edgy performance. Not traditional. This Juliet is no shrinking violet. She has an attitude. My favorite character is Tybolt. His is a comanding performance. Sort of the Darth Vader of ballet with his black costume with a bit of red. He is the last person we see at the end of the performance.

The technical aspects of this DVD are very good. Very clean picture and clear audio
combine with camera work that doesn't call attention to itself make for a very
enjoyable experience.

There is a small amount of music added to the Prokofiev score. I have no problem with this. I do regret the serious cuts in the glorious music of Prokofiev so I have to deduct a star.

The choreography is by Angelin Preljocaj. Ballet Preljocaj passed thru recently on
their North American tour. I saw Blanche Neige (Snow White). I bought the DVD also.
I strongly recommend Blanche Neige. Why doesn't Amazon US have it?",1334448000,,1226,4.589041095890411
7956002,1,B00005UQ8I,"This was the worst version of Romeo and Juliet imaginable.

Ugly sets, ugly costumes, ugly choreography.

I watched it all the way thru hoping it would improve.  Never did.  I was glad when it ended.",1313452800,4,199,4.6
7956003,5,B00005UQ8I,"Be careful not to be put off by those who don't like modern ballet!  If you want great traditional performances, go for the Paris Opera version, or even the early Russian Ulanova version.  Both artistic triumphs.  But don't discount this Opera de Lyon version which is equal in its own right.  It grabbed me emotionally and intellectually.  The choreographer, Angelin Preljocaj thought this through and made choices that provide a meaningful, insightful, interpretation.  I loved watching this.",1278806400,,494,5.35064935064935
7956004,5,B00005UQ8I,"Boy, do we ever have differences of opinion/aesthetic on his one!  Yes, the score is hugely truncated but don't forget, music fans, that Sergei himself produced not one, not two, but THREE (truncated) suites of this ballet music.  And on top of that various conductors have created their own suites for performance and recording.  So we'll toss out that gripe.
This is a powerfully moving and beautiful ballet, and very creative.  This Preljocaj:  he's a genius as far as I can discern.  If you view this DVD with an open mind, you will find your open-mindedness hugely rewarded.  Highly recommended.",1275955200,,600,4.94
7956005,1,B00005UQ8I,"I have seen this danced by the Royal Ballet in the 1960s and by the Kirov in 1996.  This is a travesty.  Snippets of the music... not the full score with scene fillers by some other modernist.  This to me was a porn version - shortened at 85 minutes - the full score runs more than 140 and even the traditional La Scala version is 115.

I was a fool not to read the reviews fully here before I purchased.  I since have bought the LaScala version which is fine.  The first customer review about says it all - don 't pay any attention to the official Amazon one.

Everyu thing here is trashed...music dancing and story.",1122249600,5,617,4.222222222222222
7956006,5,B00005UQ8I,"Agree with previous five-star reviewer.  We all weep buckets each time we see the prolonged lovers' death scene, in which Juliet hurls herself relentlessly at the dead guy, trying eventually almost to crawl inside of him. Our only question is, where can we find more DVDs featuring this choreographer and dance company?  Conductor Kent Ngano, who always seems to be in the middle of great musical projects, will soon replace Charles Dutoit as artistic director for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.  Maybe he'll bring similar works to that part of the world.  Here's hoping.",1101254400,3,573,5.129032258064516
7956007,2,B00005UQ8I,"I had looked forward to seeing this production - or ANY production - of Prokofiev's masterpiece but the intrusive and clangorous intrusions  into Prokofiev's score by a ""composer"" by the name of Goran Vejvoda utterly ruined the experience for me.
Nagano's conducting of the superb Lyon Opera Orchestra is exemplary, as usual, but the additions to a fully-realised score of genius by Prokofiev were an affront to good taste and dramatic sensibility.
The dancing is above average but it is truly unfortunate that Goran Vejvoda was allowed to destroy and make hackneyed the superb score of Serge Prokofiev.

7956008,2,B00005UQ8I,"Don't pick up this DVD expecting to see a classical rendition of this famous tale...you will be sorely disappointed.  The Lyon Opera Ballet's ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a hard-edged, sterile, and chilly retelling of one of the most famous love stories in history.  Angelin Preljocal's choreography is described on the box as ""startling"", and that much certainly applies --- the choreography is decidedly modern, with not a pointe shoe in sight.  The problem is, it doesn't seem to fit the music.
Let's look at the ""Balcony Scene"" as an example.  If you've ever seen a production of the original Kenneth MacMillan choreography, you'll remember the soaring lifts and sense of giddy abandonment that accompanies Prokofiev's exquisite score.  Don't look for that here.  The scene starts as Romeo slits an armed guard's throat on a catwalk.  Juliet sheds her oversized white shirt to reveal what looks like bike shorts and an elongated corset with bizarrely accented nipples (?!) as Romeo enters.  The music takes flight but our lovers remain obstinately earthbound, groveling, stomping, and flailing in a pas de deux that more often resembles a violent rape than the tender meeting of smitten young lovers.  In one repeated motif, Romeo tries to fling Juliet's limp arms around his neck several times, only to have them drop bonelessly down again.  The Kirov this is not.
In the interest of full disclosure, I have to say that I've never liked modern dance to begin with, and this production did nothing to change my mind.  The dancers aren't BAD, mind you; watch for some stunning feats of agility and strength.  In her first entrance, Pascale Doye (Juliet) performs a forward bend into arabesque and rises slowly onto half-toe, then does several passes before moving into an agonizingly slow developpe a la seconde, again rising to half-toe with nary a wobble.  (Also, watch for the German shepherd later in the ballet.)  It's just that this production is murky and cold, and it's hard to tell what's going on at times.  Still, if you enjoy avant-garde choreography you might want to give this one a look.  But if you don't, steer clear.",1068595200,16,2130,4.941011235955056
