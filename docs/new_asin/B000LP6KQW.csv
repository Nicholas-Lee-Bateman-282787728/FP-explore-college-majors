8162929,3,B000LP6KQW,"I purchased this DVD because it had such great and interesting figures being interviewed, but found the whole thing rather dry and uninteresting.",1396828800,,145,5.3478260869565215
8162930,2,B000LP6KQW,"These are some of my favorite thinkers. Content is dated, too short, poorly edited . Hard to follow. But short in this case is good.",1381190400,,132,4.32
8162931,5,B000LP6KQW,"This is a must for every cosmology buff, science fiction/fact fan! I've watched three times, and I still enjoy it. Buy It.",1337126400,5,122,4.590909090909091
8162932,5,B000LP6KQW,i loved this little film! its rather short but deep and beautiful. All the scientists are funny and kindly grandfather types who make the incomprehensible somehow simple . the information remains mind blowing and relevant even though i think this film was made in the 70's . watching it uplifted my spirits and made me think more about god concepts and the power of the unconscious.,1237680000,8,382,4.803030303030303
8162933,3,B000LP6KQW,"Three of the greatest minds of our lifetime and very little new or useful information.  Magnus Magnusson asks some of the more redundant and useless questions.  Hawking shows he is not only a mathematics genius he is a surprisingly witty comedian.  Arthur C reminds me of my grandmother ,and Sagan is ,as always, three steps ahead.  It's not a bad dvd but having devoured most of their other work this one leaves me feeling like I wasted a little time and money.  Oh well, go science!",1226361600,31,484,4.5813953488372094
8162934,5,B000LP6KQW,"To say the least the first review on this video is by someone who must have sniffed too many markers or is clearly more interested in NASCAR than knowing the answers to the deepest questions that humans ask themselves.

The video features Carl Sagan, world renown astronomer from Cornell, Stephen hawking, best selling author and mathematics professor and Arthur C. Clark, possibly one of the greatest minds in science fiction. This is a landmark video, and should be on everyones shelf.  This is a great way to learn about three very great viewpoints in the universe.

I have read A brief History of time, and Stephen hawking pulls heavily from his book.  Carl Sagan also mentions many themes present in Demon Haunted World, and there are echoes of Pale Blue Dot there also.

To say the least i loved the video. and it was NOT boring.  It got my brain working and i was up all night thinking.  Id give it thirteen stars if i could.",1195171200,63,932,4.578313253012048
8162935,5,B000LP6KQW,"This is a video that gathers 3 of the greatest mind of the 20th Century.  Arthur C Clarke invisioned the communications satellite before we had the technology to make one.  The late Carl Sagan was an amazing voice of reason and logic.  Steven Hawking has brought that information to the average person, so that we may all understand our futures and our pasts better.  More time should be taken to understand the message that these great men are attempting to convey....",1189382400,57,469,4.753086419753086
8162936,1,B000LP6KQW,"I got this DVD, the quality is poor, also no pictures or graphics in the movie, just a conversation in a small room that is not interesting, also one of the guys (Stephen Hawking )cannot speak and just type the answers in a computer with some voice speech recognition that is not clear (I am not kidding) you can get sleep watching this DVD because it is like listening a old radio from a garage sale. The real price for this DVD can be just $0.99 in Walmart. I rated 1 star because there is not ""0 star"" available. Take care before waste your money like me.",1175212800,11,558,4.224299065420561
