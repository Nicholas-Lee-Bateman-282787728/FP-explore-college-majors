Whilst only one of a series, nonetheless every episode is a complete story and is superbly cast and acted.  I recently saw an excellent TV documentary of a real police investigation and realised on reflection that this series of Wallander came the closest to portraying the reality of police work.  The acting by its principal characters is hypnotic and I doubt if it could be bettered.  I am a great fan of the Alec  Guinness,(George Smiley in Tinker Taylor Soldier, Spy), and Kevin Spacey, (The Usual Suspects), quiet, introspective style of acting and here we have a perfect exponent of that craft.  Every episode, and this is no exception, draws you straight in to the story which incidentally are always well written.  If I could watch only one detective drama series it would be this.
A word of warning, watch it once and you will become addicted and wish to purchase further episodes.  This is very expensive particularly as Amazon series sets are grossly overpriced.  Never mind, enjoy this episode, Krister Henriksson's acting alone is worth it.",1255996800,,1147,4.876288659793815
