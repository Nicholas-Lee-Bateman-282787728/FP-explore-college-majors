2370668,4,B000A6T1KY,"I'd happily give it 5 stars had it included the ""Hit the Road, Jack"" sequence (a squeamish NBC shelved the original broadcast for several months, and I assume the Ray Charles estate charges a lot of money to use the song on a DVD today), but this is a brilliant dark sitcom. Dabney Coleman gives a still-stunning lead performance, and he's surrounded by one of the great ensemble casts in TV history. Much better than the vastly overrated ""Murphy Brown"" and a major influence on ""The Larry Sanders Show.""",1131753600,7,504,4.674157303370786
2370669,5,B000A6T1KY,"I loved this show when it was on. The ensemble of terrific actors,all lead by D.C.,was way ahead of its time in the early 80's. Actually...not too many shows have had the edge that ""B.B."" had. So,all in all I am very happy to have these episodes available when I need my quota of sharp-edged humor,and darn fine acting.

But..I specifically wanted to see the episode where Bill is speaking with a ventriloquist,and makes a really off-color,and hysterically funny comment about the courage it takes to ""operate"" the dummy. Or sock puppet,I can't remember. I watched all of the episodes over a three day period,and didn't see that particular scene. Anyone remember that one? Is it on the ""Hit the Road Jack"" episode??

Well..if I cannot laugh myself sick over D.C.'s delivery of that one line,then I am glad to at least be able to have a million other laughs with this set of DVD's. D.C. is a terrific actor. The entire cast was/is. I only wish the network would have realized what a gem they had in this show.

Now..I will wait patiently for ""Slap Maxwell""  to come out on DVD. Another treasure short-shrifted by the network ostriches.",1131062400,17,1134,4.683417085427136

2370671,5,B000A6T1KY,"I've been waiting for this one!  Coleman was brilliant in the show.  I'm looking forward to the episode where a news crew shows to do a story on Bill which he thinks is going to be a tribute, but which is really an expose of how bad it is to work with him.  He keeps rehearsing how he majestically wants himself shown- then finally gets so tired of waiting for his time on camera, he imagines himself telling the woman interviewer off and her forcing herself on him.  This show pioneered the concept the Seinfeld show later embraced about a flawed character who demonstrates no emotional growth or 'warm fuzzy' moments. Can't wait for the release!",1125705600,11,647,4.551724137931035
2370672,5,B000A6T1KY,"I haven't seen the DVD release of Buffalo Bill yet, but I have deeply fond memories of this uncompromising and very funny series. This is only one ever to dispense with the obligatory poignant moment toward the end of the half-hour; in other words, Dabney Coleman's character remained rotten to the core, not all soft and fuzzy under a crusty exterior. I am grateful that this DVD is going to make these shows available again.

Just the episode with the fifty Jerry Lewis impersonators will be worth the price.",1121731200,18,510,4.730337078651686

2370716,3,B000A6T1KY,"Dabney Coleman swimmingly pulled off the role of obnoxious lout in the 1980 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nine-to-Five/dp/B000E6ESI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nine to Five</a>, and was a superb choice to play much the same part in ""Buffalo Bill,"" a sitcom about a local Buffalo TV talk show host.  This DVD set contains all 26 episodes of that short-lived series that were originally broadcast on NBC from mid-1983 to the spring of 1984.

Coleman's character Bill Bittinger was a pompous, walking faux pas, causing nonstop headaches to the staff members who worked to produce his show.  Unsurprisingly, his family relations were strained, and some of the episodes centered around topics such as ratings, the possible cancellation of his show, his angling for advancement, and dealing with a stalker.

This series roared out of the gate in the first three episodes with several laugh-out-loud moments and a cool theme song, but faded to an extent later.  There was also some vapid political and social commentary in the show.  The show's devotees think that it should not have been cancelled so early--that is debatable, but ""Buffalo Bill"" did have its moments and was fairly entertaining.",1423008000,,1240,5.60427807486631

I'm a TV Show DVD collector and will end up giving this one to Goodwill because I don't think I could watch it a second time as the show really wasn't funny (I don't recall if I even had any LOL moments), which is sad because I'm a fan of Dabney, Geena, Max, and Joanna.",1415232000,,499,4.242105263157895

Perhaps the only specific scene I actually remembered from the show, all these years later, is of course Hit the Road Jack.  And as commented on by others, it ain't here.  Not surprising they couldn't get the song licensed, but quite a shame.  Would love to see it again.  But the rest of the episode, and all the other episodes, will have to suffice.

2370754,5,B000A6T1KY,"One of the best, well-written, hilarious, comedies of all time. Dabney Coleman is an underrated actor and comedian. He is simply brilliant as Buffalo Bill.",1356048000,,155,5.24
2370755,5,B000A6T1KY,"In the wrap-up to this 1982-83 situation comedy series, Dabney Coleman's character, Buffalo, NY talk-show host Bill Bittinger vents every one of his bottomless frustrations on a visiting Catholic priest, during an unforgettable interview-gone-bad. He gratuitously accuses the man-of-the-cloth of molesting orphans. Bad call. The priest is first baffled and then outraged, and the predominantly Catholic community of Buffalo comes together to demand the firing of the blasphemous TV host.

This would count as edgy stuff, back in 1983. However, in light of what we now know occurred in church-administered orphanages throughout North America and around the world, it must be seen as Bittinger's prescient send-off, foreshadowing a much more complicated tomorrow, in which bitter backbiting would become common coin.

The decision by the show's creators to make light of the unspeakable topic of child abuse, 30 long years ago, in some way may be in keeping with the term Buffalonians use to describe their region: the Niagara Frontier. It's no coincidence that the character of Buffalo Bill was a kind of frontiersman of the eighties, a comedic advance-scout blazing a trail for a coming generation, which came in the form of toxic broadcasters such as Glenn Beck, a new crew who failed to understand Bill's premise, that outrage is supposed to be mined for yuks. Consequently, the series' one last laugh lodged in your throat is Bill's signature sign-off line: ""Be good to yourselves, and be good to Buffalo.""

If only.

2370756,5,B000A6T1KY,"One of the best shows on television, and a favorite with my family for decades now.  From reading the negative reviews, it's obvious that the humor is not for everyone.  It's probably not an acquired taste--you either chuckle, or you don't.  Do NOT expect jokes or typical joke rhythms (set up, punch line; set up, punch line).  It's situational, and wry, and off-beat.  Like jazz, the joy is in the unexpected riffs and silences.  The acting is top-notch, of course, and the mixture of poignancy and fun is justly famous.  The character of Bill is just too abrasive for some people, I know.  Try it: you've never seen anything quite like it.",1331164800,3,642,4.669642857142857
2370757,5,B000A6T1KY,"I watched this occasionally while home from college back in the 1980's, and very much enjoyed the eccentric, yet somehow oddly encouraging, humor, concerning a small city (Buffalo, N.Y.), it's famous talk show (""The Buffalo Bill Show""), and of course the head of it, Bill Bittinger, played (exceptionally well) by Dabney Coleman.  Buffalo Bill thought that he was not only the head of the show, but pretty much Buffalo itself; and the man was almost insufferable in his selfishness and mendacity.  But we all loved him.  Not sure why, but perhaps because he reminded us of ourselfes.

  The 'show' was on tv for only about one year, before it was unfortunately cancelled.  A show ahead of its time, perhaps, in the advanced nature of its humor, being that to some degree it was self-referential.  The plots in each episode are really not so important as are the characters themselves:  the leader, Bill; the shy, retiring, executive producer (played by Max Wright); the intelligent lady manager (Joanna Cassidy); and in an early role, information manager, and consultant to the head, a young lady played by Geena Davis!

  I have read a review here which complained of a 2 or 3 minute section being taken out of the series: and while this is true (because of copyright laws concerning a song), I would recommend not being too concerned with this... I actually never saw the missing segment, but I would say that sure it was no doubt a nice bit, but it was just 3 minutes or so out of a whole series!  And there was a nice disclaimer concerning this sent with the product. In conclusion therefore, if you like odd comedies, I heartly recommend the Buffalo Bill Show as here presented.",1306195200,2,1683,4.742268041237113
2370758,2,B000A6T1KY,"Like the other reveiwer, I purchased this set specifically for the ""Hit The Road"" episode.  The music scene was deleted from the episode with an apology explaining failure to get permission.  Why didn't they simply leave the sound out but include the video ?  It still would have been funny.  This same thing happened to a portion of the ""Elegant Iggy"" episode of Taxi Season 4.  Selling these incomplete dvd sets simply puts the screws to the consumer.  Before buying, I now check the availability at my local Library.",1300579200,7,519,4.775280898876405

2370760,5,B000A6T1KY,"Oh wow! I finally found it! I've been looking for The Buffalo Bill Show for years!! I hope the missing sequence everyone is talking about isn't the one of Newdell as the menacing jungle native of Bill's fevered imagination. Brilliant. I will also be watching closely for the little moment where someone gave Bill a handful of raw bacon for some reason, which he passed on to Woody, and then to remedy his greasy hands, he rubbed them on Woody's suit jacket as he pretended to pat him on the arm for helping him out. That's so Bill. He thinks he's putting one over on everybody and they're all rolling their eyes behind his back. Some very subtle stuff in this show. I wonder if Rick Gervais ever saw Buffalo Bill...",1256169600,3,715,4.465648854961832
2370761,2,B000A6T1KY,"This series must be one of the most overrated I've ever seen. I'd been waiting almost twenty years to watch it - ever since I read about it in a book called ""MTM: Quality Television."" What a disappointment!

Another reviewer puts it bluntly: it just isn't funny. There's no doubt Dabney Coleman is very good, but Bittinger's not as odious a character (and therefore original) as I'd been led to believe. Danny DeVito/Louis De Palma on ""Taxi"" did it better years before. Moreoever, Coleman doesn't have any funny lines to say.

The show is weakly written and the humour rather obvious. It's certainly not a terrible show, but it's not worth owning.",1254355200,2,647,4.767857142857143

Ah, as a teenager, I so enjoyed this show. Pretty shifty for a sitcom, it caught some of us as well as a good many critics. But the network didn't know what to do with it, lacking faith in their little duck of a show. With such a crap transfer and an obnoxious laugh track, this set begs a question:

 Why bother releasing something if you're not going to respect it at all?!?

2370783,4,B000A6T1KY,"I remember when this show was on, I read about how great it was and did try to watch it but it never caught on with me or much of the public.  I bought the DVD because I wanted to take a second look at the show and because I love Dabney Coleman from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.  This show was more formulaic than I thought it would be and I can't say I because attached to any of the characters, a major problem with a TV show which depends on the attachment.  It did not seem as innovative as critics often mention it as and to me the laughs weren't there.  I found it especially unacceptable that a man would get a woman pregnant, have an abortion and continue to date her afterward.  What's up with that?",1240012800,,707,4.094202898550725

2370785,2,B000A6T1KY,"Here's an example of a sitcom that had a perfect cast, a great plot, and even a cool theme song. It just wasn't (and still isn't) very funny. Almost every ""joke"" falls flat. But don't worry, if you should find yourself NOT laughing at any of the jokes, the annoying ""laugh track"" (canned laughter) seems to be having a great time!

If not for the 80's nostalgia and great cast, which includes Dabney Coleman, Joanna Cassidy, and a very young Geena Davis, this would be a VERY painful viewing experience. Don't believe the critics who cliam it was ""too hip"" to survive. The reason you're not laughing isn't because you ""don't get it"", it's because it isn't very funny. A shame that Jim Borrows and Glen and Les Charles (Taxi, Cheers) weren't at the helm, then it might have had some REAL laughs and could have become a true classic!

Still worth a look for 80's nostalgia hounds!

2370789,2,B000A6T1KY,". . . Only, maybe, in short bites. But buying the Season 1&2 and seeing all episodes end-to-end is definitely overloading. The bile is only diluted by the brightness of a beautifully-young Geena Davis and the smart sexiness of Joanna Cassidy. By the end of Season Two, Bill just seemed plain vile and mean-spirited.

Although there were some moments, the overdone caricatures of the milk-toast producer, continuously- obsequious stage manager and stilted/ dated writing makes Bill into buffalo chips. Dabney Coleman is a terrific talent; if the writing and characters were better done, he and his ensemble could've, should've made it past the two-season mark by a long, long way.",1174521600,4,679,5.172727272727273

If you've never seen the show, do yourself a favor and do take it out for a ""test drive"".

After taking that test drive either two things are going to happen, #1 it's (Buffalo Bill) gonna completely hook you in ""big time"".

Or, #2 you're still gonna be left clearly amazed that nothing else on T.V. has ever left you cheering, and jeering at any one thing so much as this particular television show will.

Believe it or not, both of these strong emotions can happen to you (the cheers and jeers) at the same time while watching Bill (Coleman) go through his motions.

This (Buffalo Bill) just may have been one of the best t.v. programs ever.

Then again, there's also the possibly of ""The Slap Maxwell Story""  having been also one of the best too (also starring  Dabney Coleman), you can be the judge on that one, if it ever does makes it to DVD.

Slap Maxwell was also a quirky, but brilliant show like Buffalo Bill, but that's another story all together.

And earlier I said to you that I would not go on and on about this show, so I guess that in regards to doing just that, I lied.

8075219,5,B000A6T1KY,"Edgy Tom Patchett & Jay Tarses created (and co-executive-produced with Bernie Brillstein) sitcom about a small Buffalo, NY TV station whose main attraction is a local talk show hosted by Bill Bittinger (Dabney Coleman in a made-to-order role), an unstable, egomaniacal, hypocritical, womanizing (male chauvinist) middle-aged scoundrel who delusionally thinks he should be a national network star.

The excellent supporting cast includes Joanna Cassidy as Joanna (""Jo Jo"") White, Bill's director from the booth, who has had an off-and-on love affair with him against her better judgment (repeatedly taken in by his machismo and phony charm, which she knows is phony); Max Wright (the future Willie Tanner on Patchett & Brillstein's ""ALF"") as emotional milquetoast station manager Karl Shub, who is being driven neurotic by Bill's unpredictability, aggressiveness and off-the-wall, shoot-from-the hip antics; Geena Davis (in her TV d&eacute;but) as Wendy, Bill's newly hired, navely optimistic young research assistant; John Fiedler (a Tarses & Patchett veteran from ""The Bob Newhart Show"") as Woody Deshler, Bill's stage manager and personal toady; and Charlie Robinson as Newdell, the star's black make-up man who is endlessly intimidating only in the closet-racist mind of Bill Bittinger.

Guest stars include Martin Landau, Jim Carrey (22 years-old and uncredited, in one of the most brilliantly hilarious walk-on performances in sitcom history as a Jerry Lewis impersonator who creates bedlam in Karl Shub's office), and the great soul-jazz singer Esther Phillips (rarely seen on TV), as herself.

All 26 episodes are here (on three discs) in reasonably good quality.  The sound is not the best, and the oddly patched-in canned laughter (that I wish could have been removed for the DVD) doesn't help matters.  This series, with its very unconventional title character (given his unlikableness) would have been better on cable where it could have avoided prime-time network concessions and restrictions and ultimately enjoyed a longer run.  There are no DVD extras.

Note: One sequence from the original series had to be dropped, much to the chagrin of the producers, who apologize profusely for this although it's not their fault: Bill's guilty-conscience racial nightmare set to the 1961 Ray Charles record ""Hit the Road Jack,"" whose licensing rights for the DVD could not be acquired for any price.
