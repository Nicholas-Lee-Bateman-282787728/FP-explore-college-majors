7960217,5,B000064135,This is an outdoor concert recorded in 1994.  Despite its age and the outdoor recording conditions the concert was great.  The images were solid with good resolution and color saturation.  The sound was excellent.  There was no miscellaneous sound distractions such as wind or crowd noise.  the video director was Brain Large who always does a great job in capturing classical music on video.  I love the color transitions from daylight to evening to night.,1444521600,,457,5.026666666666666

7960220,5,B000064135,"One of the most energetic conductors I have ever seen, listening to a piece by him explains why a conductor is so important - he brings life and verve to staid selections. Then on top of rousing selections - he raises the bar!!!",1432944000,,228,4.325581395348837

7960222,5,B000064135,"This is a happy, sparkling concert by one of today's finest conductors. Spectator enthusiasm builds throughout the excellent performance,despite the inclement weather at this outdoor concert, while we, the participating DVD audience, can share in the joy many times over and under much more comfortable circumstances at home.",1352937600,3,325,5.791666666666667
7960223,1,B000064135,"I have had great difficulty playing anything new by Kultur. So just a word or warning to anyone purchasing this disk that if you have new equipment that both plays and records, the disk may not play. Kultur disks seem to stop around the third selection. On some of the disks you can go to the select scene option and start at the end of the disk and watch things backward which doesn't work well with say a full length opera. This disk however will not even let you go to the main menu once it stops. I have several bad Kultur disks that I kept thinking it was my equipment's problem. My equipment plays other manufacturer's disks just fine. I returned this one and will never purchase a Kultur product again.

What I could see of the concert which was just the first two selections was fabulous. I'm willing to be the rest of the program was great also.",1329609600,2,854,4.3375
7960224,5,B000064135,"Even though the light music featured in this album may not be to everyone's taste, one piece, Enescu's ""Romanian Rhapsody No 1"", demonstrates the mysterious, magical conspiracy of factors that make a great concert:

Mariss Jansons' intensity, physical exuberance, and sense of fun (this was before his heart attack) inspire the orchestra to a state of something like intoxicated delight in their performance. The marvelous editing shows individual performers grinning, clearly infected by the enthusiasm of their leader.  If you want to know why musicians become musicians, and why audiences can sometimes be completely carried away by what they are seeing and hearing, you can see the answer in this utterly captivating recording.",1285804800,12,731,5.460176991150442
7960225,5,B000064135,The viewer has the impression to be part of the huge crown at this fine concert!,1284336000,,80,4.0625
