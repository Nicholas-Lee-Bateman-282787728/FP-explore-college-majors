8387975,5,B0033HKCVE,I Remember watching this movie on TV. I loved it then and I still love it.  Very funny movie.,1426464000,,93,3.8947368421052633
8387976,4,B0033HKCVE,"Not a new film, but light hearted, innocent, and a little funny. I was frankly surprised to see how much my son enjoyed it (8 years old), but it's one of those movies that he would never admit to his friends that he liked it! Want a movie without all the special effects and confusing action that is just good clean fun? This one is worth a try.",1415059200,,345,4.088235294117647
8387977,4,B0033HKCVE,"Finn on the Fly is pure silly. Silly storyline about a lab experiment that gets lapped up by a dog which turns him into a human. My 8 yr old loved it as previous experiments gone bad resulted in guinie pigs with human fingers and the such. The kid who plays the dog-turned human is super and while the film may not be theatrical-level, it proved to be a fun afternoon of zany viewing.",1271462400,2,384,4.202702702702703
8387978,3,B0033HKCVE,"Finn on the Fly is a decent family movie, although I'd have reservations about showing it grade schoolers.  It was directed by Mark Jean, who has mostly shot for television in the past.  Not surprisingly, the movie has a noticeable Made-For-TV feel to it.  But the cinematography is good, as is the soundtrack.

I appreciated the fact that our lead character, Ben Soledad, happens to be Hispanic.  But what's confusing is that Ben's family moves to a small Northern town from Spain, yet unlike his father, Ben doesn't have the slightest hint of an accent.

The standout performance in the film is by Ana Gasteyer, better known for her six-year career on Saturday Night Live.  She's delightfully evil as the fame-hungry mad scientist Dr. Madsen, and her antics keep the film moving.

Finn on the Fly isn't a Blockbuster kid's film, so it's no surprise that it never made it to theaters.  But where the movie really suffers are the choice of jokes used in a film obviously geared towards kids.  There's an airport bomb joke in the movie that was simply in horrible taste, and jokes about cavity searches seemed more appropriate for a Chris Tucker film.  As an adult I found some of the jokes really funny, though it would be awkward having to explain them to a nine year old.

For being a low-budget film, Finn on the Fly is still a decent kid's flick.  But it's still a PG film with a few heavy jokes, so I'd suggest that you watch it at least once before showing it to your little ones.",1270598400,6,1486,4.541353383458647
