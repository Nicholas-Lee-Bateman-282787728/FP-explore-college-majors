3664658,5,B001KEHAG2,"I saw a pre screening of this gem,and it has set the bar for moviemaking, for me. A new director,It places you in the present with these characters,you never feel like you are watching a movie,so much as experiencing these people's lives. Put it at the top of your list. It belongs there.",1232496000,9,288,4.452830188679245
3664659,5,B001KEHAG2,"FROZEN RIVER is not the sort of movie that will ever generate excited enthusiasm or exuberant praise.  It is a movie of quiet power, and a reminder of what acting can really be like.  It won't change lives or stir national debate.  But it can remind us that movies have the power to show us, up close, how others live.

Set in upstate New York, right along the border to Canada, we meet Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo), a late 40-something mother of 2 boys, aged 15 & 5.  She's sitting her beat up little car, in front of her seriously run-down tiny mobile home...obviously frozen in shock or anger or sadness over something she's seeing (or not seeing) in her glove box.  Turns out her husband Troy, a problem gambler, has found her hard-earned stash of cash...the cash that was to make the initial payment on a new double-wide mobile home for her family.  We soon learn that Ray Eddy is almost single-minded in her NEED to get this trailer for her family.  For these very poor folks, it is a step into luxury...one that promises a better life for her kids and a Jacuzzi tub for her.

Her oldest son is often left to care for the younger kid, and he has a pretty good idea of just how broke his family is.  He even turns to phone credit card scams to earn some extra money.  But he's only 15 after all, and he might think he's pretty hardened, but he's not.  He's also torn between anger at his mother (who he blames for driving his dad away) and anger at his father for gambling their money away and leaving home.
While searching for signs of her husband, Ray Eddy meets Lily (Misty Upham) a belligerent, empty-faced Mohawk woman with problems of her own.  She's recently lost her husband to drowning while he was running illegal immigrants across the frozen river that runs through Mohawk land between Canada and the US.  Her mother-in-law has taken her infant son away, and Lily lives in a tiny camper in the woods, trying to scratch out a living, and trying to find a car to use for running illegals.

The two women forge a very rough partnership.  Ray Eddy sees a chance to get back the money her husband squandered and Lily sees a chance to make some money to help provide for her child.  To say that these two women are not well-suited to a life of crime is putting it mildly...but this is no caper movie about criminal schemes gone wrong (although some things DO go horrifyingly wrong).  It is an exploration of poverty and a study of these two women and their relationship.

What's nice is that the film doesn't depict these two women becoming buddies, or comrades or even laughing together over a beer.  They need each other to get what each of them wants, and they don't really care for each other all that much...or at least, they don't care to understand each other.  Except you can imagine that driving illegal immigrants over a frozen river in freezing conditions, compromising your own values, just to take care of your kids DOES have an effect on Ray Eddy & Lily.

Thankfully, the film never preaches either.  It isn't making a political point.  These people are poor, and expect to be all their lives.  No politician or political party is going to change this.  We aren't asked to think, ""ah, if only we could help these poor folks.""  We're asked to understand what people in these circumstances might do for their families.

The film manages to build the most incredible tension during its second half. I will NOT tell you the various things that happen.  In a way, they could be deemed as being a bit too ""Hollywood""...but the movie has earned your trust and drawn you in, that you don't see the developments as mere plot twists, but instead as the natural outcome of what these women go through.  For a movie so quiet and unassuming...it sure had me on the edge of seat and filled with dread.  It also has a truly satisfactory ending...something SO few movies can really claim.

There are a few problems with the film.  Ray Eddy, despite all her fierceness and protectiveness, is pretty stupid with money.  There are a couple of nagging loose-ends (what happens to the cars?).  There is also a NY state trooper (Michael O'Keefe) who functions almost like a slow-witted Javier...that it to say, he's a convenient device who makes a couple of unlikely appearances.  Also, I couldn't help wondering if Ray Eddy was totally ignoring programs that might have helped her, like food stamps.

But for every little nagging moment, there is a wonderful observation.  My favorite example:  Ray Eddy's family nearly misses their next payment on their Rent-to-Own TV.  And despite the squalid conditions they live in, their TV is of the giant, widescreen variety.  Everything else in their house is cheap and/or broken, but hey, this is America and we've got to have our priorities straight!  Sure, they're eating popcorn and tang for breakfast...but at least the cartoons are giant.  The sad thing is...this observation is all too believable.

And let me also say that the performances are revelations.  Misty Upham has the calm, stone-faced demeanor we often see in Native American characterizations...but she shows us in only the tiniest ways, what is going on beneath that exterior.  Charlie McDermott plays the oldest son, and he's thoroughly convincing as a smart but nave, angry but lonely 15 year-old.  But best of all is the always remarkable Melissa Leo.  Perhaps the best performer in 21 GRAMS, a movie packed with powerhouse work...Leo never ceases to be anything but down-to-earth and ""un-actorly.""  She is the most unshowy of performers, yet her characters feel lived-in and alive.  Never afraid to look haggard or lost, Leo also never fails to show grit and determination in a way that is believable.  Sadly, in much the way that Molly Shannon was overlooked a couple of years ago for her work in YEAR OF THE DOG, I imagine Leo will be overlooked come this awards season.

But I hope you don't overlook FROZEN RIVER.  For a movie with such bleak subject matter...it is surprisingly uplifting and starkly beautiful.  And with little bad language and no sexual material...I'd encourage you to let your kids aged 14 and up take a look and see how a movie NOT playing in the local multiplex can be so satisfying on a completely different level.",1222473600,28,6255,4.653600729261623
3664660,5,B001KEHAG2,"""Frozen River"", the new independent film directed by Courtney Hunt, opens with an extreme close up of Melissa Leo (TV's ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"") who stars as Ray Eddy, a woman living with her two kids in a single wide trailer in upstate New York, near the Canadian border. As the camera lingers on her face, slowly pulling back we see every line and wrinkle and watch as she nervously smokes a cigarette, a tear falling from her eye. This image is very powerful and helps to establish her character and set up the entire film.

How often can you say that?

Ray is crying because her deadbeat husband, an Indian with a gambling problem, just took the money Ray has saved for the down payment on their new double wide, complete with a fancy tub. When she realizes her husband has run off with the cash, the morning the double wide is due to be delivered, this is the final straw. She isn't about to let him ruin her dreams. Again. Her older son, TJ (Charlie McDermott) is old enough to know what is going on and tells her he can get a job, fixing computers. She won't hear it and demands that he finish school and help her look after her youngest son, Ricky (James Reilly). Ray sets out to find her husband and their other car. She spots the car in the parking lot of an Indian Bingo Parlor and tries to go inside. Soon, Lila (Misty Upham), a young Indian woman exits the bingo hall and gets into Ray's other car. Ray follows Lila back to her trailer and finds out her husband abandoned the car when he got on a bus the previous night. Lila is interested in buying the car, but Ray won't do it. Then, Lila tells her why she needs the car, to smuggle illegal aliens over the border from Canada. Ray won't have any of it, but Lila explains they are in Mohawk territory. It isn't illegal. And Ray won't be arrested because she is white. Ray decides to help her, because she needs the money for their new home.

Written and directed by Courtney Hunt, ""Frozen River"" tells an interesting, unique story in a very real way, helping us to understand the characters and what they are doing. When you leave the theater (or turn off the DVD player), you will feel the impact of this story. It is that good.

Melissa Leo's career is filled with independent films and television work. She had a role on the memorable ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" as a detective and member of the squad who dealt with some of Baltimore's grittiest cases. She had a memorable role in Tommy Lee Jone's ""The Three Burials of Melquaides Estrada"". Every time I see her act, I am drawn into the performance by the quality she infuses in the role. Every time I see her, I wonder why she hasn't become a bigger star. But some of the best actors working in film are perfectly content to make independent films, appearing in roles that challenge their abilities and make them better actors. Melissa Leo is an example of this; her career has been varied, unusual and interesting. Is she the highest paid actress working in Hollywood? I doubt it. But how much money do you actually need? Also, Leo is not a beautiful bombshell like so many of the actresses who currently top-line A-List features. And it's sad that so much of what makes an A-List actress these days is how 'hot' they look. Would Bette Davis or Katherine Hepburn even get a second glance in this day and age? I'm not sure.

From the moment Ray sets out on her quest to find her husband, she begins a juggling act. As TJ chides her about searching for his father, she has to squash his offer to take on some work, he can help generate some income for the family, so they don't have to eat popcorn and tang for breakfast again. Even though she tells him she is not going out to search for her husband, his father, this is exactly what she does; she goes hunting for the dead beat. But she is looking for him for a reason that has finally come clear. After all of the years of his gambling problems, his inability to provide for his family, Ray's years of working at the Yankee Dollar, she is trying to find him to retrieve the money she has worked so hard to save, so she can still get their new double wide. And her new bathtub.

When she can't find him, she talks to her boss at the Yankee Dollar and tries to get him to finally make her an Assistant Manager. When that doesn't work, she has little choice and finds Lila. They travel across a frozen river, to another Mohawk outpost on the Canadian side. Driving up to a shack, an Indian comes out, meeting them at their car with an envelope of cash. They pop the trunk and two Chinese men hop inside. Back on the New York side, they stop at a little motel. Another man gives them an envelope and they pop the trunk again letting the two Chinese men go with this new man. Ray is happy. Another couple of runs and she will have re-earned the money her husband ran off with. She doesn't think about the two men and what they might be doing. Later, after another run, Lila fills her in on some of the details. Ray pauses for a moment and realizes the end result; her family's new home outweighs what she is doing.

But these runs are taking another toll. And a State Trooper (Miles O'Keefe) stops her and tells her that they suspect Lila of being a smuggler.

Lila is also an interesting character. Stoic and largely unemotional, she is doing these runs to earn money as well. Because of her poor eyesight, she has difficulty with most jobs, so this is a good alternative. But the head of her tribe frowns on the practice of smuggling, because it brings unwanted attention to their tribe. So they get the word out. Don't sell a particular type of car to Lila (basically, anything with a trunk) and try to find her some work, keep her honest. But honest work creates a slow stream of revenue.

Misty Upham is very good as Lila. She gives you a real sense of the pain and trial her life has been. We learn very quickly she also has a baby, a one year-old boy who was taken from her by her mother-in-law. She is trying to make enough money to help provide for the child, a child she never gets to see. This makes her cold and unemotional and provides further evidence she has been beaten down by everyone and everything her entire life. As she and Ray begin to make these runs, they start to talk and learn about each other. You might say they become 'friends', as friendly as the two women can be towards one another. They aren't ever going to go shopping together, or share cosmos, but they will become friends.

Charlie McDermott plays TJ, Ray's oldest son. Even though TJ knows his dad is a deadbeat, he still comes to his defense, trying to defend him when his mom continues to badmouth his dad. She even makes a comment about this and quickly dismisses it because she knows her son will never completely see his dad for what he is.

TJ is actually a really good kid and cares deeply for his younger brother. And even if he doesn't want to admit it, he knows his mom is right about his father. But he can't let her know that, he's a teenager and it would give his mom too much power if she knew he knew she was right. As Ray begins to make these border crossings, she leaves TJ at home to watch Ricky on a more frequent basis. This leaves TJ with a lot of time on his hands, because Ricky is pretty content to simply stare at the television for hours on end. As the two boys spend a lot of time unsupervised, TJ has to cook for his brother and make sure he stays safe. But as there is frequently little, if anything to eat in the house, and TJ is barely a teenager, both of these tasks prove daunting at times and his attention drifts.

As Ray and Lila continue to make these runs, Ray continues to maintain she is only going to do enough of them to raise the money for her down payment. And as Christmas is just around the corner, she would love to have the new doublewide in time for the holidays, so she becomes more persistent in making runs. And wants to make a run, across the frozen river, even after a heat wave has probably compromised the ice. She just needs one more, and she has a gift for her kids no one thought possible.

Ray is so determined the make this happen, she ignores the warning signs. A state trooper (Miles O'Keefe) shops at the Yankee Dollar and watches the road they use after crossing the river. One day, he stops by her trailer to tell her that he knows Lila is a smuggler. Most people would take the warning and quit. But the money is too easy and her goal is too close. So she continues. Then, when the heat wave hits, she insists on completing the run. The cargo also changes, giving her pause.

Over the course of the film, we learn a lot about both Indian culture and the ease with which people can smuggle others across the border. ""Frozen River"" is not an After School Special, but the authenticity of these moments helps to inform the narrative and make it seem more real and touching.

""Frozen River"" is what an independent film should be. A story about people who could be real, making real decisions, real mistakes and painting a picture of life that we might not otherwise know about or see.

""Frozen River"" is a very good film. You shouldn't miss it if for no other reason than Melissa Leo's performance alone.",1218499200,44,9276,4.331606217616581
3664661,5,B001KEHAG2,"This 2008 independent film won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival.  It is the first film by director Courtney Hunt and it was shot in just 24 days and a small budget in the upstate New York town of Plattsburgh, New York during the dead of winter.

This is the story of two women and takes place a few days before Christmas.  Ray, played by Melissa Leo, has just been deserted by her husband.  She's in her late forties and is the mother of a 15-year old and a 5-year old boy.  She works part time in a dead-end job in dollar store and is almost penniless.  She can barely feed her family, her TV is about to be repossessed and there seems to be no way she can make the balloon payment on a new double-wide trailer on which she has a down payment.  Lila, played by Misty Upham, is a Mohawk Indian who lives on the reservation and works in the local bingo parlor.  She is also penniless.  Her husband is dead.  Her baby has been taken from her by her mother-in-law, and she lives in a run-down trailer on the reservation.  This reservation occupies parts of Canada as well as the U.S., and she can make some good money by driving across the frozen river between the countries and smuggling illegal immigrants into the U.S.  But she needs a car.  And Ray has the right kind of car with a large trunk.

The landscape is cold and bleak.  Their car is a rickety Dodge Spirit.  The women are strong, hard and desperate. They hate each other but soon realize that if they work together they might be able to improve their situations.  The plot moves fast and is almost pure action.  Their characterizations grow out of their situation.  We see the different ways that Indians and whites are treated.  We understand the hatred that the Indian woman feels for the white woman.  We get a sense of the desperation of the illegal immigrants.  At first there are Chinese immigrants.  And later there is a Pakistani couple with an unusual package.  Christmas is coming.  The state troopers are on their trail.  What will the outcome be?

Of course I can view this film in other ways.  It was unique in that the two women were both so strong and that a Native American woman was cast in a role that was not a traditionally feminine one.  Also, these women aren't beautiful and Ray's face is real - mottled skin and tiny lines and expressions that don't need words to convey emotions.  It touched on several hot-button issues - illegal immigration, ethnic hatreds, desperate economic conditions in small upstate towns, and seriously hard choices some people have to make.  However, I didn't think of all of this until the film was over.  While it was on it was simply a fast-paced, action packed story that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved it!",1218240000,60,2750,4.436

3664686,5,B001KEHAG2,"A tightly-constructed, atmospherically-shot, and very well paced independent film, ""Frozen River"" reveals the full extent of the talent of an actress I had previously seen in small parts: Melissa Leo. She plays Ray Eddy, a woman living in a small mobile-home in upstate New York, near the Canadian border and near an Indian Reservation that spans the border and that therefore has become a place from which people can be smuggled into the United States.  Ray gets into smuggling because she's desperate -- the money she had been saving to make a downpayment on a double-wide has been taken by her husband, a gambling addict, and one of the first shots in the movie shows us a close-up of Ray, weeping in her car outside her home, with the empty glove-compartment testifying to her husband's theft of the money.  It's just before Christmas, and  she has to go in and tell her five-year-old son that they won't be moving to a new home after all.  She finds her husband's car, which has been appropriated by a Native American woman, Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), who has troubles of her own -- she has been widowed as a result of her husband's having taken her place on a smuggling run late in her pregnancy, and her child has been taken by her mother-in-law.  She wants the child back, and she's trying to use smuggling to raise the money to be able to take and keep him.  It's Lila who tells Ray that she saw her husband abandon the car -- leaving the keys -- and get on a bus.  Ray assumes he headed for Atlantic City.

The story tells how the women start to work together as smugglers to make what they need.  There's nothing glamorous about the operation: it involves driving over the frozen St. Lawrence River, and the Highway Patrol is on the watch when their car gets off the reservation (where the HP has no jurisdiction).  Meanwhile, Ray is dealing with her elder son, T. J., who is 15 and is willing to drop out of school and get a job to help out.  His mother resists this plan, and the dynamic between the deserted woman and the abandoned boy is beautifully and plausibly played by Leo and Charlie McDermott.  There comes a point -- avoiding details to avoid spoilers -- where one last run (so both women hope) has to be made to garner the money they need, and it doesn't go well.  Again, the circumstances are plausibly handled, and the suspense that is built up is achieved without resort to melodrama or special effects.  Near the end, Ray has to make a choice -- or, rather, she makes a choice that she doesn't have to make, and the way that she makes it is beautifully consonant with the way that we have seen the relationship between the women developing.  The ending is touching, without being implausibly optimistic.

Misty Upham, who died tragically about six years after the film was made, is memorable as Lila.  The focus of sympathy and emotional interest has to be evenly balanced if the film is going to work.  These are two strong women -- not a plucky white woman taking care of a hapless Native American.  There is in fact something like a power-struggle early in their dealings with one another, but then the relationship settles.  Each comes to understand the family dynamic of the other, so this is a movie about ""family values,"" if you can detach from that term all the sentimental accretions it has undergone in the last 30 years.  Doing the wrong thing to do the right thing is an old story in movies, but it's very effectively employed here.",1440633600,,3476,4.556270096463023

The stories of working class women and mothers are seldom told onscreen, and the honesty of the performances makes this movie an incredibly moving experience. Ms. Upham left us far too early. She demonstrates here exactly why she was the preeminent Native American (Blackfoot) actress of her time. Her ability to convey deep emotion in the most subtle and soulful ways is simply unforgettable. May her work live on. An outstanding film that explores the courage and grit of ordinary people.",1417737600,,597,4.98
3664711,4,B001KEHAG2,"Melissa Leo and Misty Upham star as Ray Eddy and Lila Littlewolf, two struggling single mothers in 2008's ""Frozen River."" They form an unfriendly alliance to make money by smuggling illegal immigrants into the USA via the Mohawk Reservation on the border of New York and Quebec. The ""frozen river"" of the title refers to the frozen St. Lawrence River that they drive across to carry out their activities.

This is the kind of drama I really like. Despite the weak acting of some of the Native cast members, the film's like watching real life. The story is slow and maudlin, but it captures your attention till the end. The climax is both low-key and inspiring. I was impressed with how the filmmakers covertly included potent subtexts.

This isn't a Christian film by any means, but take note that the story takes place around Christmas time. Lila points out to Ray that she and half the Mohawk tribe are not converts to Christianity and so ignore Christmas and follow their Native beliefs. Later, when something mind-blowing happens, Ray tells Lila that she did something really amazing, but Lila openly admits, ""It wasn't me; it was the Creator.""

I mentioned the questionable acting of some of the Native cast members, but I'd rather have weak acting with real Natives than great acting with people pretending to be Natives.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Plattsburgh, New York, Ontario and the St. Lawrence River.

3664747,5,B001KEHAG2,"Melissa Leo received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Actress (of two total for the movie, the other being Best Original Screenplay by Courtney Hunt), and even though the Oscar went to Kate Winslet that year (2008, ""The Reader""), Oscar voters certainly didn't forget Leo's out-of-the-park performance here (the proof being her Oscar win for ""The Fighter"" just a couple of years later).  Leo plays ""Ray,"" the mother of two young sons who is persuaded to smuggle illegal immigrants over the Canadian-U.S. border by her new Native American partner in crime, ""Lila,"" played by co-star Misty Upham, a decision certainly influenced by Ray's husband deserting her (with all their money in tow) and leaving the family to fend for themselves, as well as Ray's dream of one day owning a double-wide trailer home for her two young boys.  Upham's performance as Lila, a widowed new mother with problems of her own (including her mother-in-law having ""stolen"" her baby), matches Leo's upper-echelon acting, scene for scene, and their respective 1-2 punch performances have probably only been paralleled in recent history by Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger in 1983's Best Picture Oscar winner ""Terms of Endearment.""  Charlie McDermott (TV's ""The Middle"") and Michael O'Keefe (a past Oscar nominee for ""The Great Santini"" and also known for his role as ""Fred"" on ""Roseanne"") round out the impressive, top-notch cast in a movie that is cinematic evidence that great movie-making doesn't have to be on a grand, expensive scale with over-the-top special effects to be entertaining, gripping, believable, and powerful, one that stays with you long after the credits roll.  It was Hollywood's ""The Little Engine that Could"" in 2008.  In fact, even Quentin Tarantino (director of ""Pulp"" Fiction,"" ""Kill Bill,"" etc.) publicly praised it.  It's doubtful that all mothers around the world can relate to the desperation of Leo's Ray character here, but on the contrary, they undoubtedly can relate to a mother's love for her kids and the seemingly limitless lengths she'll go to make sure that they have the best a mother can provide, and this movie should be next on their (and everyone's) must-see list.",1388793600,2,2191,5.157746478873239

What I didn't know when I ordered it was the story is supposed to take place about 45 minutes from where I live. Melissa Leo plays an abandoned mother of 2 trying to make ends meet with her husband gone. She meets a young woman from the Indian Reservation on the Canadian border in northern New York State. The young woman gets Melissa Leo involved in driving over the frozen water of the St Lawrence River to take illegals acrossed the border form Canada to the US. Some of it is filmed on location.

3664749,5,B001KEHAG2,"Ray and Lila are good people but with very different views and attitudes.  Though they meet under unique circumstances and originally hate each other.  They pair up to make some fast money by transporting illegal immigrants.  When tragedy strikes, the women see that they are much more alike than different and their mutual appreciation for the other's situation forges a friendship and ultimately self-sacrifice by each woman on behalf of the other.

Both are in stuck in situations beyond their control. Both must rely solely on herself to make the best in the face of obstacles created by others, who desire them to fail0 out of personal spite or indifference. Both of these great mothers have chosen to succeed no matter what the risks or consequences.  It is through their appreciation of the other and their willingness to cooperate despite of their initial assessments of the other, that they both triumph but not without a great deal of self-sacrifice, the assistance of the other woman and punishment.

The scenes are orchestrated to portray the desperation of their individual situations.  While, some women may have given up, their love for their children drives them to forge on no matter what.  The law, the people and nature are all symbolic of the coldness of their world and their misfortunes.  I was impressed with the script, writing and acting.

This is an area of marginalized existence to the Mohawk people,on their northern country reservation,which straddles the USA/Canadian border. They are unpatrolled and a minority make a lucrative living in trafficking illegal immigrants. Sub-zero temperatures operate a major vice. Poverty is the real subject. Melissa Leo acts as single mother Ray,whose gambler-husband has made off with the savings she has made for a new home. She has two boys,one about 7 years age the other about 16 years age. Ray has a part-time dead-end job in a supermarket, with no prospects,and lives in a trailer. With payments to meet on her new home,her son wants to work but she won't let him. Her character is shown by a wiry exasperation to survive her own victimization, and yet her tender regard for her youngest child and Xmas,and getting some presents together for him. She also scrapes money from the back of the sofa for money for fares and lunch at school. She strikes up a connection with Lila(Misty Upham),a native American woman,who breaks the law by smuggling illegal immigrants in the boot of her car,as she is unable to get employment otherwise.

Her child has been adopted by her mother-in-law following the death of her husband by drowningin an illegal run. Ray gets in with Lila to do some illegal smuggling to make some payments. Hunt's direction is occasionally striking, as in a searching pan from the ground of the film's weather-beaten New York-Canuck borderland to the exhausted face of Melissa Leo (shedding tears).Some of the script is clunky or underwritten,like knowing more about the illegal immigrants;the Pakistani couples' baby left out in the snow in a bag;Ricky's forced apology to the old lady,whose credit card he's scammed;the police officer calling the next day(Xmas) to advise her against mixing with Lila. The child who Lila removes from her mother-in-laws,only after she is fitted with glasses. You feel there is too much contrivance and manipulation,to keep the audience onside. The interiors are too dark to see in. The immigrants become commodities without identity. Hunt has created a gritty milieu and makes women the main players in a thriller with guns, which plays down guns to more effect. Leo is a revelation,acting with her whole body,dragging on a cigarette,messy hair. This role was her calling card to both Oscar nomination and later glory in The Fighter. This opens up more roles for older women. Also the subject of poverty from Wendy and Lucy to Winter's Bone.

3664779,5,B001KEHAG2,"This is an outstanding film. It's the story of Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) and her struggle to care for her two young sons. It's set during a bitter cold Christmas season along the Canada-New York border.  Her husband, a gambling addict, has run off with the money intended for a new double-wide mobile home. So, the family must remain in a ramshackle trailer. There's not enough income from her part-time job clerking in a dollar store to adequately support the family; they are down to dinners of popcorn and Tang.

Ray drives her car across the frozen St. Lawrence River, accompanied by Lila. They pick up undocumented people in Canada, stash them in the car trunk, and cross back into the U.S.

The acting is solid indeed. Leo's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy. The direction and writing of Courtney Hunt are flawless. There is nary a dull moment.

3664800,4,B001KEHAG2,"""Frozen River"" wasn't widely released when it came out last year, nor has it gathered much steam in the interim. Without the advocacy of its fans, its availability on rental, cable television and dish, an Oscar nomination for one of the players, and a recent boost on AOL as am underappreciated Christmas-themed  movie, this flick would probably rest in obscurity. But the 75 mostly 4 and 5 star reviews here attest to its lasting value.

""Frozen River"" is the story of two women in upstate New York that engage in smuggling illegal immigrants from Canada to the U.S.A. by driving them across a frozen river from one county to the other. The Christmas angle is one of the stars' (Melissa Leo, playing the poor mother of two kids) husband deserts her at Christmas and blows all their money in a casion, leaving everyone blank for the season and creating the motivation for her to engage in the new line of work.

In a search for her missing husband, she enters into a relationship with a native American woman (Misty Upham) who tips her off to the opportunity at hand, to make a few hundred dollars shipping people from one side of the river to the other. At first hestiant, economics soon forces Leo into the deal and the die is set for what becomes a classic tragedy set in modern times in modern society.

While the tragic angles are played out like a poker game, with participants cleverly hiding their hands while bidding and keeping their growing emotions under tow so as not to tip off their bounties, the film is also full of cross signals. At one point, one of the heroines ends up in jail for her trouble but gets the equivalent of a slap on the wrist sentence. In another, Leo's older son, who has to run the household while mom drives people from Asia and India across the river in the trunk of her car, bolts but returns. Still another time, a well-meaning local cop who knows about the scheme seems to protect Leo while implicating Upham in what he knows is going on. And the illegal immigrant theme, one that is about as explosive as any social theme in America, is never exploited for either good or evil purpose.

In this respect, ""Frozen River"" is more the odd slice of life or even coming of age film than a morality play since the morality never reaches an apex or is delivered with the force of a hammer. This insolvency of intellectual ideas, coupled with underlying secondary stories about Leo's kids and Upham's roles in both human trafficking and the Indian community where she lives, is part of what makes ""Frozen River"" such a fetching film. Once you are fully engaged, there is no way to easily describe the screenplay and no way to predict exactly what is coming next, although nothing in the film (once you know what's going on) would exactly be called unpredictable. But there's enough to keep you glued to the screen while the action is going on. So four stars for an exceptional effort, wonderfully acted and shot, of a movie that really doesn't have a lot going on at any given time.",1293321600,2,3016,4.557195571955719

3664802,3,B001KEHAG2,"A very surprisingly good low-budget indie film that I recently watched after DVRing it on one of the premium movie channels is Frozen River (2008). It's amazing to me how good this movie is for being made on less than a million dollars. The budget was somewhere between $500k and $1 Million according to writer/director Courtney Hunt whom I listened to on a Creative Screenwriting Magazine podcast (available for free through iTunes). It's movies like this that give me hope as a filmmaker because you see how having a good story can trump millions and millions of dollars in ""production value"". To me, this movie is as good as 2012 or Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), both of which had 100-200 times the money. At the core of filmmaking is and always will be the story...and its emotional connection (or lack thereof) to the viewer. Frozen River works because of that.

The movie is about a middle-aged mother, played in flawed and wrinkled beauty by Melissa Leo, and her struggle to take care of her two sons. Her deadbeat husband has run off with the money they were saving as a down payment on a new double-wide trailer home, so she has to find a way to get some money by Christmas to keep the home. While looking for her deadbeat husband, she runs across a Native American woman, Lila Littlewolf, on the nearby Indian Reservation that straddles the Canadian border in New York. Apparently the husband was there playing Bingo and left his car behind. Lila stole the car because she needs it to smuggle illegal immigrants from Canada across the frozen river that runs through the Indian Reservation. Lila is also a mother trying to get enough money to get her son back so she can take care of him.

While this movie is pretty plain in its production value, it's still filmed quite well. And what really shines is the story and the characters. I got pulled into this ""everyday"" story about these people and quickly was caught up in their lives. This is not a flashy movie by any means, but if you like character-driven dramatic movies like Crazy Heart (2009) and Fargo (1996), you might just find this movie to be your cup of tea.",1286236800,2,2143,4.622047244094488

3664804,5,B001KEHAG2,"Frozen River is an excellent indie film about the struggles of two women in desperate need of money and what they do to try and get it. The plot flows along very well and there's good character development which I enjoyed. The casting was perfect; these actors are truly believable in their roles and this enhances the film even more. The script was well written and the movie is timely in more than one respect.

When the story begins, we quickly meet Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) who works a dead end job in a dollar store near where she lives at the Canadian and New York State border. Life is rough for Ray and her two children Troy (Charlie McDermott) and Ricky (James Reilly); they were abandoned by her husband, the children's father just a few days before Christmas. Ray wants to go full-time to make the payments on a double-wide trailer but she finds it nearly impossible on her part-time salary to just buy food or even finance the color television they have. Ray soon meets up with the rough and tough Mohawk Indian Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham) who works for a few bucks on the Indian reservation supervising bingo--but who actually makes much more money smuggling illegal immigrants through the border between Canada and the US by driving them in the trunk of any car she gets her hands on over a frozen river on the Mohawk Indian reservation.

When Ray initially gets mixed up with Lila and the people she associates with, Ray is displeased, to say the least. Lila has stolen her car because it has a trunk with a push-button release so that the immigrants can quickly jump out of the trunk after reaching a station in upstate New York just over the Canadian border. However, when Ray realizes the huge amount of money she can make, she somewhat reluctantly teams up with Lila for a few ""runs"" across the border smuggling people while Lila assures her that because it's ""on the res"" the state troopers have no power to arrest them.

Of course, there's plenty more to this story but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that the plot will hold your interest; this is one very well done film! Look also for great performances by Michael O'Keefe as Trooper Finnerty and Michael Sky as Billy Three Rivers.

I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in dramas, crime dramas and even social issues concerning the poor and what extremes they can go to get much needed money when they have next to nothing to feed their children and themselves. In addition, people who are interested in immigration and illegal immigration will find this film to be quite timely.",1284163200,2,2587,4.605206073752711
3664805,4,B001KEHAG2,"""Frozen River,"" Courtney Hunt's feature debut, is not what you call entertaining. It is a realistic look at desperation and hardships. Veteran actress Melissa Leo plays Ray Eddy, a working mother facing financial difficulties. Though the film deals with such topics as border smuggling, ""Frozen River"" works as a grim drama with credible portraits of two women in the most desperate situation of their lives.

The story is set in northernmost New York State, near the St. Lawrence River. It's before Christmas Eve and Ray Eddy is in big trouble. Her husband has disappeared with a car and money - the money to buy a new house. Ray finds the car at a bingo hall, but the driver is not the missing husband, but a woman named Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), who says she found the car at the bus stop.

Lila has been engaged in smuggling across the frozen river. Ray has a car and she needs money. You know what happens next. As a crime drama the story of ""Frozen River"" is slightly contrived and most supporting characters including Ray's two children are conventional at best. Moreover, its tone gets a little softer and less edgy in the second half, though the portraits of two women Ray and Lila remain convincing.

The well-acted drama benefits greatly from the two leads, especially Melissa Leo, who was deservedly Oscar nominated for the role. The film is worth seeing for her great acting alone. In spite of some of the plot contrivances, ""Frozen River"" is a well-made indie film,  a film that is not about crime, but about these unlikely partners in crime, and some unexpected changes that happen to their life, described with compassion.",1269820800,2,1643,4.774647887323944

3664808,4,B001KEHAG2,"Hollywood rarely offers honest depictions of poor or working class America. In this way, ""Frozen River"" is a pioneer film.

In the first shot of the film, the audience is introduced to Ray, the main character (played with brave, ferocious realism by Melissa Leo) as she sits outside her trailer in the cold, her raw, middle-aged face shedding bitter tears. Ray's irresponsible husband has taken off with the money they had saved to put a down payment on their new home, leaving her alone, broke, and responsible for her two children.

Ray is not a damsel in distress type. She puts on a brave face for her children, her angry teenage son and cherubic five year old, and goes out in search of her husband. By chance, she comes across a young Mohawk woman and falls into a lucrative, yet dangerous, position as an immigrant smuggler.

And so it begins. I doubt there is anyone in the audience who can blame Ray for her actions. She's desperate, alone, has children to provide for, and only a menial job working in a dollar store to provide an income. All she wants is a tiny little portion of the American Dream - a decent home for her kids. She's not lazy or stupid, she's just a normal woman trying to survive and take care of her family. So it's heartbreaking to watch her involvement in crime bring more and more anguish and trouble into her already bleak life.

As a suspenseful drama, ""Frozen River"" is interesting and entertaining. And as a portrait of the American underclass, it's unfliching.",1262044800,3,1499,4.62406015037594
3664809,4,B001KEHAG2,"I recently saw Frozen River, at a local theater. This indie film revolves around two impoverished single mothers; one white, and the other a member of the Mohawk Native American tribe. The setting of the film takes place in the harsh, bleak climate of upstate NY, near the Canadian border during wintertime.

Melissa Leo is brilliant as the haggard, world-weary single mother, Ray. Ray's gambling-addict husband, has left her and their 2 sons in the lurch. Right before Christmas, he splits with the savings that Ray had planned to use as payment, for a better trailer home than the one her family has been residing in.

Ray tries in vain to support herself and her children, on income from a part-time retail job. She doesn't get the promotion to Manager, that she had expected at her job. As a result, Ray and her family are in dire economic straits; they subsist on popcorn and powdered juice, are on the verge of having their TV repossessed by a rent-to-own store, and face a Christmas without presents. Worst of all, the coveted 'double-wide' trailer home that Ray has long dreamed of purchasing, is an impossibility, without the savings that her husband ran off with.

In desperation, Ray goes looking for her husband in a gambling Casino, located in Mohawk tribal territory. One of the young Native American women of the tribe, Lila (played with a dry, dour efficiency by Misty Upham) steals the car that Ray's husband had abandoned, in the Casino parking-lot. Ray sees this, and pursues Lila to her tiny trailer home, located in a remote woodsy area.

Lila is also a single mom whose husband had died, and left her with a 1-year-old son to raise alone. Lila doesn't want to give Ray the car back, and doesn't respond to threats that Ray will turn Lila in to the local cops. According to Lila, white man's law is void in Mohawk territory. After a brief scuffle with Lila, Ray pulls a pistol, and shoots a hole in Lila's trailer. Frightened by this, Lila makes Ray an offer; if she lets Lila keep the car, then Ray can join Lila in her lucrative immigrant smuggling operation. Ray reluctantly agrees.

This film offers-up lots of stark, yet gorgeous, moody scenery. It dovetails well, with the gripping suspense of the smuggling-runs made by Ray and Lila. They must always keep one step ahead of the local State Troopers, hope that the sleazy smuggling kingpins pay them what they are owed, and complete their smuggling-runs without the frozen river caving in.

The basic premise of the film is grim, but highlights the lengths that two desperate single mothers could be driven to, in order to support their families. We need more films that address the serious plight of the working-poor, in American today. Especially films about poor single mothers, and the acute economic hardships that many of them face in today's economy.

The main problem with Frozen River, is that there are some implausible plot details, throughout the film. The producers obviously wanted to make a film with lots of emotional impact, and depth. They succeeded, but also should have made sure that they smoothed-out the rough edges in the storyline. Overall though, I would recommend Frozen River.

A woman with a husband with a gambling and drug habit loses money for a down payment for a new trailer and presents for her kids.  She ends up with a very dysfunctional young Mohawk woman who lives off of smuggling illegal immigrants into the US.  She uses a car on the St. Lawrence River during winter to cross.  The Mohawk Nation is in both Canada and the United States so law enforcement can't intervene as they can off the reservation.  Some very concerning things happen along the way which make the story very moving.  The setting and the actors are very real and the story is original.  There is nothing phony about this movie and it is very impressive.  The lead actress Melissa Leo was nominated for Best Actress.  The movie won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and was the opening night feature at New Directors/New Films in New York, a high honor.  Really memorable feature.",1251072000,3,1193,4.392694063926941
3664816,5,B001KEHAG2,"The positive reviews that ""Frozen River"" has recieved created high expectations from Indie Film Fans and it doesn't dissapoint mainly becasue Melissa Leo carried the movie.  Her portrayal of Eddy Ray, a working poor mother living in the US-Canadian border in the dead of winter is spot on.  Her life is a struggle, every inch of it, but just when you think she's gonna get beaten down, she kicks back the tears and continues the fight.  The fight to provide a better house for her sons, the fight to get her fair share from a smuggler even if it means pointing a gun  ready to shoot, and the fight for her own dignity.  She shares the struggle with Lilah(Misty Upham),  a Mohawk Indian who has become a pariah in her own community. They are bound by this struggle because of their shared commonality, both are poor women with no husbands(one died tragically and the other walked out) and minial jobs, both are loving mothers and  both have no one to depend on except ultimately each other.  I wouldn't label this movie depressing because these women are strong and don't ask for pity, it's like they're saying ""it is what it it, ladies""  This is a movie about working poor women who have very little options and have no luxury of time or choices to make it better. It is also about learning how to trust a complete stranger because deep down inside you know she's a mother just like you and she will do the right thing just like all good mothers do. And lastly, this movie acomplished a lot with so much constraints like the limited budget and limited time to shoot it.  It is rather impress.  Highly recommended.",1250985600,,1613,4.527586206896552

Nothing in this movie is predictable. What you suspect will happen, doesn't. What you don't expect to happen, does. Every character is believable. Each one evokes a different emotion from the viewer. Just by standing there and saying nothing, the cop sends shivers up your spine. From the main characters down to the bit players, each one plays his and her part with an uncanny excellence. I cared about all of them. The casting of this movie couldn't have been better.

This movie is a prime example of the desperate measures decent people will take when things turn bad and all hope for a better future is gone. From the smugglers to the smuggled, they all have something to gain and something to lose, yet the hope for a better life overrides their fear as well as their senses.

You can watch this movie with your older children. There are no sex scenes, no violence. If there was any swearing I don't remember it.

Desperation forces Ray amd Lila to smuggle illegal aliens from Canada through Mohawk country into the U.S.  The film terrifically portrays severe impoverishment that would force these women to do the unthinkable.  Leo and Upham are superb as two strong women who take extraordinary means to keep their respective families together.  My reservation?  Despite it's theme the film makes nary a comment on illegal immigration.

3664833,5,B001KEHAG2,"I won't recount the story as many of the other reviews have already done that. Suffice it to say that this is a very unusual, well told, strikingly photographed and brilliantly acted film.

There is nothing usual about it...it's not filmed in New York City, Paris or LA...who has ever even thought of this desolate area of New York State on the Canadian border or the Mohawk reservation?  Glamorous it's not.  Mellissa Leo is a beautiful woman but she plays it down here...every line on her face tells the fact that this character has not had an easy life. There is no boy-meets-girl romance in it.  No sex or violence.  No political rhetoric.  It's just a very interesting, believable tale of two women who are desperately trying to make better lives for their children.

The elements that enter into the story could be subjects for polemics--the plights of poor immigrants, poor Indians, poor women, gambling problems...but we are spared any preaching.  It's life in the raw...probably one that most readers here are not familiar with, and yet it is so well told that anyone with a heart can surely be touched.  Especially women...since the motivation for the extraordinary acts that these two ordinary women take...are for the love of their children.  Again you're not hit over the head with the message, but it's hard to miss it in the eyes of the Indian, Lila, when she sees her baby in the restaurant and when Ray, the white woman, watched the whole scene.  No words are spoken, which makes the whole thing more poignant.

The relationship between the two is beautifully told.  Ray is no white liberal who does Indians any favors---she is as cold blooded as she feels she needs to be.  Lila doesn't hid her contempt for whites either.
And yet, there in the very depth of the winter, we begin to see the hatred thaw and eventually the relationship warm and build to an amazing conclusion.

This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  Melissa Leo deserved the Oscar nomination and the rest of the cast is right up there with her.  I highly recommend it.",1243641600,4,2070,4.658402203856749

3664836,5,B001KEHAG2,"It's hard to believe that this film is a first-time effort from writer/director Courtney Hunt.  Though small in budget, it's a small gem.  Hunt's writing had us on the edge of our seats throughout the film. At one point, you're convinced that tragedy lurks just around the corner for a number of the protagonists.  And - while the outcome still has elements of bleakness and personal loss - real tragedies are narrowly averted.  You're left with the green sprouts of a slightly better future that will come to fulfillment four months down the road.

For Frozen River, she deserved that Oscar nomination and her Independent Spirit win.

McDermott's strong performance is also worthy of note: he plays his mid-teen 'T.J.' as fully aware of the desperation of his family's life; yet he strives mightily to protect the innocence and happiness of his little brother's existence.

But what would you rather see: a troubling movie that provides a glimpse into a slice of life you rarely see or a fairy tale movie with a happy ending?  Melissa Leo plays Ray Eddy, a woman whose husband has run off with the payment due on a new double-wide trailer to replace their broken down trailer. To raise money for the double-wide, Ray teams with Lila, a young Native woman, to make money by smuggling illegal immigrants into the U.S. via a frozen river between the local Indian reservation and Canada. Ray isn't portrayed as a saint. She deflects empathy; she is hard and cold. Her portrayal in this role is so convincing, she is nominated for a 2009 best actress Academy Award. But don't expect to like her. She risks jail so she and her sons can have a double-wide that they do not really need to survive. It is just that it is Christmas and she has promised her youngest son they would have a double-wide for Christmas. Lila plays the role of the stereotypical unemotional and inexpressive Native American. But her motive for smuggling is pure; she needs to raise money to get back her ""stolen"" son, which the tribe has taken from her in punishment for some unspoken past crime against the tribe. Contrary to what some reviewers say, I did not feel these women developed a bond. Ray is the user throughout the movie. The movie is well worth watching however for its portrayal of poverty-stricken lives in a bleak, frozen environment. The movie will hold your interest. But do not expect to come away feeling you have just seen your all-time favorite movie. The movie is stark and disquieting.

Sure, it's about a worthy and important subject (working class woman having trouble surviving and paying the rent, so she smuggles people across the border), but that doesn't make it a good film.  Melissa Leo's and Misty Upham's performances are decent (I actually think Misty is better than Melissa), but other performances are laughable, mainly because they're so badly written that they end up being unintentionally hilarious when they're supposed to be somber (like Michael O'Keefe's portrayal of a state trooper).

3664854,4,B001KEHAG2,"Melissa Leo earned a richly deserved Best Actress nomination for her stunning work in ""Frozen River"" playing a woman in upstate New York who's so down-on-her-luck that she resorts to smuggling illegal aliens across the border as a means of paying her bills.  Recently abandoned by her ne'er-do-well husband (who's a compulsive gambler) and desperate for money to support herself and the two young sons she is struggling to raise, Ray agrees to drive immigrants across the frozen St. Lawrence River that separates the United States from Canada.  The hitch is that the route runs directly through a stretch of sovereign tribal land belonging to the Mohawk nation - which essentially means that neither the American nor the Canadian government has any real legal jurisdiction over it.

Not since ""Brokeback Mountain"" (and, to a lesser extent, ""North Country"") has an American film focused this intensely on the everyday trials and tribulations of hardworking rural folk.  These salt-of-the-earth types, with their lived-in faces and hardscrabble lives, are apparently not what mainstream audiences are searching for when they go to the movies - a fact which likely accounts for the virtual absence of such characters from America's movie screens.  But in ""Frozen River,"" writer/director Courtney Hunt shows us what it is like for people who are forced to live paycheck to paycheck, worrying about where their next meal is coming from or how they'll be able to afford presents for their children at Christmas - and for whom happiness might well come in the form of an upgraded doublewide mobile home with a good padding of insulation and a Jacuzzi built right into the middle.  Beyond Ray, there is Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), a young Mohawk woman who becomes the white woman's partner in crime and who has a child of her own she cannot afford to take care of; and T.J. (Charlie McDermott), Ray's 15-year-old son who misses his father, dotes on his kid brother, and takes his own ill-considered stab at skirting the law in a bid to earn some much needed money for the family.  In fact, all these characters are essentially decent people driven to do things they otherwise wouldn't had circumstances not made them so desperate.

This stripped-down morality tale plays out within an appropriately stark, perpetually frozen landscape of muddy snow, leafless trees, weathered clapboard buildings and rusty, broken down trailers.  Thus, in the case of ""Frozen River,"" the bleak, wintry setting, with its eternally overcast sky, is every bit as vital to the tone and theme of the film as are the storyline and characters.

As the driving force of the film, Hunt neither condescends to her characters nor sugarcoats the harsh realities of their lives.  She allows the drama to unfold at its own unhurried pace, with only a hint or two of potential tragedy in the offing.  Leo, in a performance of amazing subtlety and sensitivity, inspires us to not only believe in the reality of Ray's life and circumstances but to care deeply about her fate and the fate of those around her.",1240012800,,3069,4.984344422700587

FROZEN RIVER is a powerful film full of heart, suspense, and good old-fashioned storytelling.  Melissa Leo anchors the film with an Oscar-nominated performance that constantly keeps the audience on its toes, wondering how far she will go - how many compromises she will make, how many risks she will take - to achieve her dream.  Courtney Hunt's screenplay and direction reveals a nuanced portrait of a region and its community rarely captured on screen (and certainly not in a mainstream movie).  While I miss the engulfing darkness the film accomplished on the big screen, the DVD commentary by Hunt and her cinematographer more than makes up for it.

3664858,5,B001KEHAG2,"A great indie movie for the discriminating film fan's collection. It wasn't a box-office smash, but it deserves the successful afterlife of the classic on DVD because it stays with you long after it's over. To me, low budget does not translate into less worthy; in fact, it can mean much more, like loaded with the truth and integrity that the gimmicky blockbusters rarely produce. So it is with Frozen River.

Melissa Leo is simply great as Ray, a trailer-park denizen and deserted mother of two trying to improve her impoverished circumstances by moonlighting as a smuggler of illegal immigrants traveling via Canada into the U.S. The perilous route forms in winter, when the St. Lawrence River becomes icebound where it bisects the trans-border Mohawk reservation near Massena NY. Just for her first extreme closeup alone -- a lingering upward pan that reveals a tense, chain-smoking, old-too-soon woman wondering how she'll get through today -- Ms. Leo should have been given the Oscar. (She was nominated for Best Lead Performance.) There are no visible ""uglifying"" makeup tricks or prosthetics; every pore and wrinkle on Leo's 40-something face and body is there to see. Thus, we also see Ray's badly bruised heart cowering behind her street-smart exterior and gritty determination: all of which refuse to let her give up, give out or give in. Ray has a dream -- to move her family up into a brand-new doublewide -- and she's going to make it happen, no matter what.

It's the film's realism that makes it so memorable. Having visited the upper St. Lawrence region regularly in my youth, I can vouch for the area's awesome natural beauty, sub-zero winters, widespread poverty (no doubt exacerbated by recent paper mill and Alcoa plant closures), underground economy and subtle racism that appears in this movie. Whether by limited budget or ingenious design, the producers, writer and director of Frozen River have mixed these important story elements in with great on-location settings and some telling cinematic detail. This includes the team's choices for the supporting roles, most of which went to local actors and non-professionals. All these factors help reveal the hardscrabble lives lead by Ray and her reluctant smuggling partner, Lila (the remarkable Misty Upham, who gained 30 pounds and cut her hair to play the taciturn widowed Mohawk mother), and why they would choose such a dangerous occupation to escape from them. Just goes to show why Hollywood movies made by committee rarely get this kind of film right.

Technically, the DVD's sole embellishment features an above-average commentary by writer-director Courtney Hunt and co-producer Heather Ray. Unlike (too) many rambling or self-promoting star turns on such tracks, their dialogue is self-effacing, targeted, full of interesting detail and revealing of how indie films like this get made.

Melissa Leo has been getting a lot of attention for her lead role (and deservedly so), but kudos also have to go to her co-star, Misty Upham, who matches her desperation and desire for a better life (at least one where they can afford food for their children). There's an especially harrowing scene involving a bag in the back of a car - won't give anything away, but that scene will definitely stick in my mind.

3664875,2,B001KEHAG2,"Here's another Indie with lofty aspirations as an art film. It's an original story: Ray (played by Melissa Leo), a mother of two children has just had her gambler husband run off with the down payment on a new trailer she was in the process of purchasing. She lives in upstate New York right near a Mohawk reservation. A Mohawk Indian woman (Lila) tries to steal her car and they end up becoming partners smuggling illegal aliens from Canada. Ray drives her car with Lila over the frozen river inside the Mohawk Reservation and picks up the illegal aliens on the other side of the border and then drives them back to New York.

Right away I had a hard time buying that the gambler husband would simply abandon his family. Okay, there are gambling addicts who do crazy things but it is established that he has a good relationship with his sons and wouldn't he at least be keeping in touch? Then there's Ray who doesn't seem to have any relationships outside of her interactions with her children. And when she does interact with her teenage son, they are always having very unpleasant, grating conversations throughout the film. Despite being a good mother and presumably someone who's never had interactions with criminals before (she tells Lila that she's never done anything criminal like smuggling before), it just so happens that she packs a gun and pulls it out right away the first time the two go on their smuggling run! Not believable. Also New York Police not being allowed to investigate a felony on tribal land doesn't sound right. And then there's the whole problem of why the Elders allowed Lila to take the baby away from the paternal grandmother who they awarded custody to after blaming Lila for having a hand in the death of her husband as well as her overall bad behavior.

The midpoint of a film is usually where the protagonist commits herself to her objective fully. The midpoint in Frozen River is when Ray and Lila pick up a Pakistani couple and are about to drive them back to New York. Unbelievably Ray has never heard of ""Pakistan"" but she's aware of the phenomena of suicide bombers. She takes a package that the woman is holding and puts it in the backseat. While driving at night over the river, it occurs to her that there might be something dangerous in the package (such as a bomb) and without really inspecting the package, throws it out of the car onto the frozen river. When she delivers the couple to a motel owner smuggler back in NY State, the two women discover that there was a baby in the package. So they retrace their route in the car, and Lila (who has trouble with her eyesight) somehow recalls the spot where they threw the package, recover the baby and return it to the grieving couple. The baby, who seemingly was dead since it was out in the cold, comes back to life after Lila warms the infant up in the car. Why a mother (even a scared illegal alien) would ever allow a stranger to take a baby away from her did not seem credible in the least nor did Ray's failure to really inspect the package.

The second act ""crisis"" involves Ray and Lila's last smuggling run where they transport two Chinese girls over the river. Before they put the girls in the trunk, Ray pulls out her gun once again and ends up in a shootout with a smuggler. Of course she's only wounded superficially in the ear. The car gets stuck in the slightly thawing ice and Ray, Lila and the two girls flee to the Mohawk reservation. At first, Ray wants Lila to take the rap and give herself up to the police. In a reversal, she sacrifices herself by surrendering to the police. With a sentimental flourish, she's told that she's only facing 4 months in jail for smuggling. Meanwhile, Lila 'takes back' her child from her dead husband's mother and for some reason, the tribal elders (who had ruled against her earlier) say nothing when she removes the child from the reservation. Lila (at the behest of Ray) arrives at the trailer and will take care of Ray's kids for the four months she's locked up. Oh by the way, Lila's eyesight is restored when she gets a pair of eyeglasses. And what about when Ray's teenage son almost burns down the trailer while using a blow torch to deice frozen water pipes? While it appears that a small section of the trailer is damaged from the small fire set by the teenager, the trailer itself does not appear to be structurally damaged. But Ray proclaims that the trailer is 'ruined' and that's why she's now desperate to make one last run to obtain the cash to make the down payment on the new trailer.

All the principals here must must have 'hearts of gold', including the teenage son--he's guilty of committing credit card fraud by victimizing elderly people on the Mohawk reservation and finds some measure of redemption after being forced by the tribal elders to apologize to one of his elderly victims. While Lila has a grudge against the 'white man' and rationalizes her smuggling as payback for mistreatment of her people, she's really not a bad person at all. And similarly, Ray, who knows what she's doing is wrong, is also not a bad person (she only gets the four months of 'hard time'). All's well that end's well when the new trailer arrives just in time for the New Year (presumably purchased with ill-gotten gains). Frozen River would have been much more of an interesting film if the screenwriter decided not to endow her characters with those one-dimensional hearts of gold and serve up such an unbelievable story with a predictable and sentimental ending.",1236988800,6,5525,4.589068825910931

The film is beautifully shot and the story is gripping and intense.  It truly depicts the desperation of one woman and the lengths she must go to survive and take care of her children.

Unfortunately, most of the supporting cast (except for the boys who play Leo's sons who are both excellent) makes the film falter at times; an independent film like this cannot budget good actors, I guess.

The only other complaint I have is that I was very, very disappointed with the ending of the film, which I won't reveal here for the sake of those who haven't seen the film.

But Melissa Leo's truly outstanding performance more than eclipses any flaws this film may have.  Hers was truly an Oscar worthy performance and deserving of her nomination.  She grabs hold of you from the first scene and keeps you.  Truly sensational!!!",1236643200,,1056,4.629032258064516

The film has a very slow pace, and the yearning of the mom's character, to carve out a better life for herself and her children is obviously. The atmosphere of the film, is gray,ordinary and hopeless, which is exactly how the characters are portrayed initially. This is a sad story of survival, and hope for these two women, who run paralell lives in many respects. I enjoyed the film, but I think Melissa's performance certainly steals the show.

I liked the story because it was authentic in that we do not typically have any animosity toward the Mohawk people in our region.  They are good hearted souls with a sad history.  The only problem I had with the movie was the part where Melissa Leo brandished a gun.  There is just no way a white person could go on the reservation and shoot at a Mohawk without retaliation.

This is by far a film that is so real and so timely that you almost feel as if you are standing alongside these characters, following them throughout their days.  It is best to just experience this movie.  Don't read too much about it, don't try to find spoilers, just let it absorb you.

Melissa Leo gives one of the most quietly understated performances I have seen in recent memory, and at the same time, it is also one of THE most powerful performances in years.  Her Oscar Nomination was no fluke and you'll see why.  Misty Upham was absolutely heartbreaking.  The entire film/production is just top notch.

3664882,3,B001KEHAG2,"Who'd of thought that a truly independent film like this (budget of only $1 million) could reach as high as it has? Certainly not me. And I consider myself a pretty good friend of indie movies.

The highest praise one can give FROZEN RIVER is definitely the performance of its main character, Melissa Leo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Burials-of-Melquiades-Estrada/dp/B000F8O2QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>) who plays Ray Eddy, wife to a gambling-a-holic, good-for-nothing husband who runs off with the family money, leaving Ray alone with their two boys, fending for themselves and on the brink of starvation. Trying to find her husband, Ray runs across his abandoned vehicle in a parking lot, only to watch it driven off by a Native American woman named Lila Littlewolf (MISTY UPHAM). Following her, Ray falls into an unusual scam that makes her travel across a frozen section of river that bisects an Indian reservation, one section on the U.S. border and the other in Canada. Once on the other side, illegal immigrants are placed in the trunk of her car and snuck across the border, earning Ray some much needed cash, and pulling Lila up financially closer to getting a lost son back, too.

The pressure is evident in the choices that must be made by Ray and Lila. Ray does it to help feed her family and to garner enough cash for the down payment on a new double-wide trailer she and her two kids so desperately need. Lila does it to build up enough nerve and cash to get her child back from a Native American family that stole him from her.

An additional pressure is exerted on Ray as she battles her eldest son, T.J. (Charlie McDermott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>) who's trying to be ""the man of the house"" in his father's absence. He cares for his younger brother and also reeks havoc on the home when he tries to unfreeze some water pipes with a blow torch (that nearly burns down their little trailer).

It goes without saying that Melissa Leo's performance carries the entire film. In fact, without her, I fear this film would've bombed horribly (thus my average rating). She was even nominated for an Oscar for her performance (Best Actress no less!) but didn't stand much of a chance against folks like Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie, and Meryl Streep. Still, it was nice to see her abilities recognized by such a prestigious awards ceremony. She did, however, win Best Actress at other smaller ceremonies like the Independent Spirit Awards, the Gotham Awards, and many, many, many film festival wins.

With Misty Upham's performance, however, is where the film starts to falter. Almost cardboard-ish in character, Upham's Lila seems to be going through the motions beside the much more talented Leo. Even when she barges in to take back her baby from the family that nabbed him, she has a flat affect with little emotional weight (if any). The other performances by the rest of the cast were also equally forgettable.

But if you're a fan of Melissa Leo, this one might be worth checking out. The moral message is also well played, giving first time writer/director Courtney Hunt a nice feather in her cap. Let's hope she can get some big name actors in her next film and she might have a great success.",1235779200,3,3427,5.132616487455197
3664883,4,B001KEHAG2,"""Frozen River"" takes place in frigid Massena, a border crossing on the Mohawk reservation between New York State and Quebec, where life is harsh and barren.  Two hardened single mothers in this bleak terrain are trying to make a life for their children.  Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham) is a widowed Mohawk whose mother-in-law stole her newborn son a year ago.  Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) is a mother of two whose gambling-addicted husband just left town with the down payment for their new trailer home.  Faced with little opportunity to make ends meet, Ray and Lila embark on an illegal venture transporting immigrants into the U.S. across Mohawk territory. When circumstances spiral out of control, the two women must make life or death decisions based on their friendship and love for their children.
 Director Courtney Hunt provides a dramatic portrait of how decent individuals resort to awful actions in the cause of doing good.  Leo, nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for this film, is absolutely riveting as a desperate woman who turns to illegal means to earn enough cash to make her children's life better.  Her Ray is an empathetic, complex character.  With a careworn face and penetrating eyes, she shows a life of hardship, unhappiness, and sacrifice.
 The location of ""Frozen River"" is stark and unforgiving, providing enormous atmosphere.  It is a different kind of movie, though it draws upon familiar themes:  single-mother survival, morality, setting priorities, responsibility, and consequences.

The story of a white woman and Mohawk transporting illegal foreigners across a frozen river so they can make enough money to raise their families and buy a double wide trailer is compelling.

3664888,5,B001KEHAG2,"Once the contrived circumstances that lead to the fortuitous meeting of the primary characters Ray (Melissa Leo), a white working class mother of two boys and Lila (Misty Uphaw) a Mohawk nation woman living on the periphery of two cultures, are discounted, Frozen River, a modestly budgeted independent work from first time director Courtney Hunt (who also wrote it) unfolds as one of the better films I've seen in a while.

Quality of life is all about perspective and for Ray and her two sons, T.J. and Ricky, delivery of a brand new double wide trailer with a bathtub where Ray could use her burgeoning collection of bath salts and fragrances would be a small step upward. It's not going to happen though, because Ray's husband, Troy (never seen), a man addicted to chance has not only squandered the food money on scratch off lottery tickets but now is missing along with the balloon payment for the new trailer.

For Lila, life is a day to day proposition, working in the reservation's bingo parlor by day and smuggling undocumented immigrants across the frozen St. Lawrence River at night. The moonlight endeavor is how her husband died and the underlying cause of tribal council admonishment.  Living on the outskirts of tribal territory in a ramshackle RV trailer, her only real objective is to figure out some way to regain custody of her toddler son.  Smuggling requires a car with a pop-lid trunk, but as a known smuggler the buy-a-wreck dealer isn't about to sell any car fitting the bill to Lila. Fortunately for her, it appears she happened to see what has to be the only man alive who is willing to abandon his freedom of movement (his car) and hop on a bus as her deserts his responsibilities.

Ray may not know the whereabouts of her husband but when she finds Lila in possession of the Dodge Spirit, there's no way she's going to absorb yet another loss. What develops from here is a tenuous collaboration that presages unanticipated adjustments in the world view of each woman and those closest to them.

Writer/director Hunt crafts a gloomy work, one that mirrors the harsh conditions confronting the residents of an upstate N.Y. border community where opportunities for progress are minimized and historical biases not only fester but grow. The film questions moral and ethical choices as well as the external influences that may drive establishment of new paradigms.  I would have preferred to see an alternative ending but for those who elect to give this film a look, it will not be difficult to understand why the director chose the existing conclusion.

In the capable hands of writer/director Courtney Hunt, it's as powerful a film as I've seen in many years. She wastes no time here, and every moment of the film has something to say. This exercise in desperation reminds me a lot of ""The Deep End"", where mom makes lots of bad decisions to aid her family. In that film, Tilda Swinton deserved Oscar recognition; in ""Frozen River"", Melissa Leo delivers a performance wrought with determination to survive, rarely giving in to despair. She's a tough cookie, though her innate goodness and sensitivity are well explored. A truly magnificent performance, devoid of cliche or histrionics, keeping it honest and viable. Almost as good is Misty Upham as Lila, the young Mohawk woman who's seen as much of life's cruelties at a young age, making their association one of deceptive understanding, suspicion; developing into a fond friendship. The intensity of the outrageous situations they create for themselves seems so hopeless and out of control, and there's a certain redemption at the end. There's also an unusually centered performance from young Charlie McDermott as Leo's teenage son. A shoestring budget is almost unnoticeable; production values are fine, especially fine photography with lots of intense close-ups, and editing that moves this along at a pace that is exhausting. I have no end of admiration for Ms. Hunt's achievement. The DVD has few extras; a trailer and a somewhat non-invasive commentary by Ms. Hunt and a producer. I was most impressed.",1234656000,3,1735,5.048780487804878
3664909,5,B001KEHAG2,"A cool chill pervades  this film, `Frozen River'.  The town of Mesena in upstate New York, on the other side of the St Lawrence River that leads to Canada,  has that grey ,wintery feel that you see  on the faces of the people trying to keep their families alive.  The only entertainment seems to be the Bingo House on the Mohawk Indian Reservation. This is a depressed, tough town, there is no feeling of joy or well being. I was  tense throughout this film, and it is tough to shake the feel.

Melissa Leo, plays `Ray' a tough minded woman who accepts her fate and asks for no sympathy. She is a suddenly single mother. Her husband took the funds they had saved for a double wide trailer, gambled it away and left town.  He left her with two sons, aged 15 and 5, a part time job at Lucky Dollar and  a broken down trailer on the edge of town. Ray spends her time fighting to put food on the table and to keep the debtors out of her hair.  Dinner before payday is popcorn and Tang.

But Ray has  grit, she meets  a young Mohawk woman, Lilly, who talks and then shows her a smuggling deal, driving across the frozen St Lawrence with illegal aliens in the trunk. The land is Indian, and the white man cannot arrest anyone on this land. There is the state police on the highway into town, but they don't stop white women. The overt racism against Indians is quite apparent and real.  The money is good,  $1200 a run. Too good to pass up and soon Ray and Lilly are on  several runs.  Money to pay for the large flat screen television, TV dinners,maybe the double wide and presents for Christmas.  TJ, Ray's son, wants to leave school and help support them, but Ray is adamant that her children obtain an education. And, besides his job is to care for his brother,  Ricky. There is love and respect in this family. Ray's eyes shine with love for her sons, they are,, after all her entire life.

The drive on the frozen St Lawrence is an analogy for the entire film,  frightening, tense , wondering if the ice will crack. Two women dealing with brutes who are dangerous and dark.  This film elicits the iey cold nights and the fear that resonates with everyone involved.  A relationship of sorts develops between Lily and Ray. Both tough women who would do whatever it takes for their children.

Melissa Leo is unknown to most. I remember her clearly from the television series `Homicide: Life On The Streets'.  She is a fabulous actress, she becomes the character she portrays. This is her film and she makes it come alive.  It is not a wonderful life, but it is a wonderful film.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-15-09

3664910,5,B001KEHAG2,"Great movie!!  I actually wanted to see this in the theaters, but never got the chance to.  So I pre-ordered the dvd.  This movie is oustanding!  It's really about a bond and sacrifices between two mothers.  A woman whose husband runs away with the money for a new home down payment, is left to take care of her kids alone.  She has no money, and faces the facts that she will lose the home.  By chance she meets a mohawk indian woman, and soon learns that this woman makes a lot of money by doing smuggling runs.  They soon become partners smuggling people across the ""frozen river""  Easy and fast money is a temptation that is hard to resist.  The conclusion is heart breaking as well as fascinating.

I definitely recommend this movie for any dvd collection, it is a must-see!  The acting is unbelievably good.",1234656000,,940,4.395348837209302
3664911,5,B001KEHAG2,"FROZEN RIVER marks an impressive debut for writer/director Courtney Hunt: here is a filmmaker that not only knows how to weave a powerful story with pacing that rarely takes a break for breathing, but one who also knows how to pull intensely dramatic performances from actors in that rarest arena of ensemble acting.  Though many viewers may avoid this film because of its suggestion of uncompromising sadness and depression in a time when 'escape movies' seem to draw the larger audiences, simply giving into this story will offer insights into human behavior - from adults and children, from minority groups, and from the disenfranchised - that allow the ending of the story to resonate subtly and memorably.

Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) lives with her two sons, teenager T.J. (the gifted young Charlie McDermott) and 5-year-old Ricky (James Reilly), in a shabby trailer house in the icy tundra where New York state meets Canada adjacent to a Mohawk Indian reservation.  Ray's gambling addicted husband has deserted his family with the money being saved for a better, larger trailer house, and Ray is left to forge for her boys at her menial job, living paycheck to paycheck and forced to feed her children popcorn and Tang for meals.  To make ends meet she attempts to find her missing husband and instead encounters his car as stolen by young Mohawk Lila (Misty Upham). Their confrontation leads to Ray and Lila partnering in smuggling immigrants (Chinese and Pakistani) from Canada to the US via drives across the frozen St. Lawrence river.  How these two disparate women find common threads under desperate circumstances provides the bulk of this amazingly rich story.

Hunt manages to explore poverty, the displaced American Indian situation, smuggling, State Trooper mentality, and the extraordinary manner in which children left to their own parentless devices manage to stay above sinking with such skill that the incredible story being told seems like across the fence conversation - it is that real.  The entire cast is exceptional, not only Leo and Upham, but all of the actors in even the smallest roles. This is a film to embrace, not avoid, as it speaks to the indomitable human spirit.

A Mohawk who hates whites and a white woman with two kids to feed and keep warm must forge an uneasy alliance in their quest for survival.  Melissa Leo and Misty Upham give strong performances in a story that is unsentimental, unpredictable, and not at all formulaic.

3664913,5,B001KEHAG2,"I ask in the title of this review if a review of this film can really do justice, and I'm just not sure.  I'll try, but perhaps the best review of this film would be the simple sentence:

See this gem of a film.

Melissa Leo has been (in my not so humble opinion) deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for her work in this film.  Her co-star hasn't been mentioned for awards (at least not that I've noticed), but she (Misty Upham) too has done excellent work here.

Frozen River is a story of two desperate women.  Ray Eddy (Leo) has been abandoned by her husband, a gambling addict that has run off with the money that was needed to pay for delivery of her family's new double wide mobile home.  After discovering that he's gone, she goes off in search of him or at least, hopefully, the car and money that he left home with.  She finds the car fairly quickly, but just as she does the car -- with keys still inside it -- is stolen by Lila (Upham).  Ray isn't to be deterred, so she follows Lila and the car to her camping trailer where she confronts Lila and gets the car keys back.  Ray tries to tow her own car home, but fails miserably in her effort.  As she tries to think through the situation, Lila tells her that she knows someone that would buy the car if she wanted to sell it.  Desperate for cash, Ray and Lila set off towards what could be some of the cash Ray needs so badly.

Of course things couldn't go so easily and Ray finds out quickly that there's more to Lila than simply taking cars that have keys in them.  Lila involves Ray in a smuggling operation, where the smuggling is of people across the Canadian/U.S. border.

Over the course of the film, we see both women form a bond, grounded in each's desperation to care for their families.  Can they make enough money to take care of their needs before they are caught?  Can they make it across the border (on the frozen river) safely even as the temperature heats up around them?

Frozen River is a fascinating story that is very well acted.  It deserves the accolades that it has garnered, and it deserves to be viewed.  Does it deserve a purchase?  I can't say for sure there, as it seems to be a film that might not be one that most people would rewatch.  The subject matter is sad and depressing, and the film itself spends much of the time on the screen showing life in a mobile home and/or showing us the two stars riding in the car across the river (meaning that it's not a scenic tour de force).  Probably best as a rental, but most certainly worth seeing and savoring.",1234656000,4,2553,4.272916666666666
3664914,5,B001KEHAG2,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-River/dp/B001KEHAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen River</a>, winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, would have flown under my radar - except for a review that I read about it.  So I took a chance on it (and I usually enjoy Sundance films.)

Am I glad that I did!  From almost the first moments - in which we see a woman on a snowy porch, smoking a cigarette, with tears rolling down her hardened features - I was drawn in.

Ray's husband, a gambling addict, has just run off with the balloon payment for the new double-wide mobile home they have ordered.  So here Ray sits, devastated, alone with her two young children, trying to eke out an existence in this god-forsaken northern village that borders Canada and lies adjacent to a Mohawk reservation.

Christmas is approaching and Ray is desperate.  While searching for her husband at a nearby casino, she spots a Mohawk woman stealing her husband's car.  Chasing the woman down, she is hell-bent on some kind of justice.  But unexpectedly, the woman has something to offer.  A chance to earn some relatively quick cash.  It will take very little, it seems - a few trips across the frozen tundra that is actually a river, transporting immigrants across Mohawk territory into the U.S....and her dreams will become a reality.

Well, of course nothing is ever as simple as that.  With the suspense mounting and danger lurking around every corner, we see the two desperate women - Ray and Lila - bonding and sharing, even as they chase after their individual dreams - sure to be realized if they finally earn enough cash.  The dream for Ray's double-wide and Lila's hope to reclaim custody of her baby, whom she lost to his grandmother.

Meanwhile, back in the single-wide trailer, 15-year-old T.J., who is left in charge of his younger brother, struggles to earn some quick cash of his own, amidst drama with frozen pipes and a small fire caused by a blow-torch - when he tried to unfreeze the pipes.

As the movie draws toward a conclusion, we ask ourselves:  Will Ray finally have enough for the double-wide?  Will Lila get her baby back?  And will T.J. manage to stay out of more trouble while he struggles on his own?

Realistically portrayed, the final moments reveal that life is not a movie and things hardly ever turn out the way we expect.

Haunting, memorable and a poignant reminder of the struggles of individuals during desperate times.

I was so happy to see that she has been nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for this movie.  She certainly deserves it!  You're gonna love it!",1233187200,5,331,4.222222222222222
3664916,5,B001KEHAG2,"FROZEN RIVER is a gripping drama that features one of 2008's finest performances.

Like Bette Davis before her, Melissa Leo is an actress who puts craft over glamor.  She's not afraid to let herself appear totally unattractive on the screen if that is what the role requires.  She more than deserves every award she's received thus far.

In this film, written and directed by Courtney Hunt, Melissa plays a middle-age woman whose husband has just left her and their two sons.  She's broke, lives in a broken-down mobile home in frigid upstate New York and works part-time at a local variety store.  Her dream is to buy a double-wide mobile home, but hubby has gambled away the money for that.

Melissa's life changes when she meets a widowed Mohawk woman (Misty Upham) who survives by smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States from Canada.  Seeing this as an opportunity to get her new mobile home, Melissa partners with the woman, but soon finds herself running from the law.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment includes audio commentary by Hunt and producer Heather Rae.

3664917,5,B001KEHAG2,"Emotionally gripping!  A fantastic performance by Melissa Leo for the film FROZEN RIVER"" which has won numerous awards, each award is deserved because this film is simply well-acted and well-done.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The video quality is very good during light conditions, especially during the outdoor segments.  But once you start getting indoors, you will see noticeable grain.  To be the truthful, the natural way the film is presented helps the storyline's presentation and its believability.

The place is covered with snow and the main places where a lot of the film is shot is inside the trailer, inside a car and when you see the car drive through the snow during the day, early evening or late at night.  So, I was not expecting eye popping visuals but the Blu-ray video does enhance scenes such as the snow and the scenery in which the women have to go through a terrain but nothing but snow in order to accomplish their job.

The audio is dialogue driven and is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  There was not need for any special effects and because of the locations, I wasn't expecting to hear any major uses of sound but the dialogue and the dialogue is quite clear and understandable.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The main special feature for ""FROZEN RIVER"" is a audio commentary by Director Courtney Hunt and Producer Heather Rae.  The women discuss a lot about the film, the people they cast for the film, the performances of the characters and the music used in the film.  As well as discussion of the certain props that were used in the film.  There is quite a bit of pausing as both women are watching the film and seem to be engrossed in the overall storyline as well.

I wish there was commentary with the talent or even a featurette with some behind-the-scenes filming of ""Frozen River"".

""FROZEN RIVER"" is one of those films that one never expects to be created.  A storyline about a Caucasian woman and an Indian woman in dire circumstances and the only thing keeping them going is their love for their children.  Courtney Hunt did an extremely well-job in writing this story and then carrying it out on film as the director.

Two important things that she manages to accomplish quite well is creating two characters that are genuine trying to survive but also realistically hiring actors that make the film seem natural.  Not Hollywood.  It's a glimpse into a world that we just do not see on film.

But to watch two women from two different worlds and foregoing whatever they may think of each other or whichever prejudices they have and establish that working relationship and eventually a friendship because mutually they need each other in order for their children to be taken care of.  I found this chemistry between the two actresses powerful and how they were portrayed in a variety of emotional situations was well-done.

I really have to applaud Courtney Hunt for doing her research and writing a touching, heartbreaking and yet gripping storyline and translating it well for film!  And Melissa Leo for her portrayal of a mother who has nothing left and she no choice but to use her last resort and Misty Upham for also making the film seem natural and real.

As for the Blu-ray, the presentation at 1080p High Definition and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 is probably the best audio and video presentation that one will ever see of this film.  If anything, I wish there were more special features outside of the commentary but overall, for the film itself, knowing that ""FROZEN RIVER"" has been an award winner and has been received so well by critics, it was definitely a pleasure to finally watch this film.

It's strength lies within the acting of the talent in the film not just by the main two actresses but even the children of Ray and everyone involved.  Everything seemed natural, not contrived or a Hollywood production.  It was a film that was well-written with great casting.

""FROZEN RIVER"" is definitely a film worth watching!",1232755200,8,4018,4.753246753246753
3664918,4,B001KEHAG2,"Veteran and extremely underused actress Melissa Leo delivers a powerful, tour-de-force performance as Ray, a mother just abandoned by her lowlife, gambler husband several days before Christmas in Northern New York state. It's cold, very cold; the kind of cold that even the tiniest hole to the outside world can turn any home into a fully functional freezer. This is experienced worse more than anyone by Lila (Misty Upham) early on in the movie after Ray discovers her stolen car in the hands of this young Mohawk girl. Both women have heartbreaking back stories that are revealed throughout the movie and both are in the same boat; their flat broke.

Ray needs to make the down payment on a doublewide trailer for she and her two sons. Lila has reasons too that I won't go into for it will spoil some of the more dramatic elements of the plot.

Lila has already been arrested for smuggling illegal aliens over the frozen Hudson River into America from Canada several times, but she knows there's money in it. When Ray hears of this she jumps in for some fast cash.

The point of this movie is not illegal immigration; it's not really even about relations between Native Americans and whites, though both are depicted. The overall tone of this film is survival and what people are willing to do to survive, to put food on the table and keep a roof over their families' head. Ray has been working part-time at the same dead-end job for over two years but is refused full-time work. Lila pays out money to senior citizens playing bingo at the local VFW. What gives this film even more depth is that these women have so many opportunities to steal money easily (Ray can take it out of the cash drawer and Lila could steal it from the half-blind Bingo players) but neither do. They are both hardworking people willing to risk, not only their lives, but their freedom to perform work that pays; Ray and Lila don't want handouts.

""Frozen River"" can be seen as a drama, which it is; but it can also be viewed as a thriller (the last forty minutes or so are as suspenseful as any big-budget Hollywood blockbuster). However, it is ultimately a story of people, people with their back to the walls that are willing to do anything for some breathing room.

Supporting roles by Charlie McDermott (as Ray's oldest son), Mark Boone jr. (as a malevolent human trafficker) and Michael O'Keefe (as a nosy state trooper) are believable and only add to this strong film by Courtney Hunt in the best debut since Patty Jenkins with 2003's ""Monster"". Her solid directing from her original screenplay (and a miniscule million dollar budget) turns ""Frozen River"" into one of the best films of 2008 and giving Melissa Leo the chance to shine in the finest performance from an actress this year.",1232582400,17,2771,4.658486707566462
