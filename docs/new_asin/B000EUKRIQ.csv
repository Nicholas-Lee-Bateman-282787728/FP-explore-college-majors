2537187,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD. At first I thought Elsa was going to mix all the styles in the whole routine, but, she chose to keep them separate, which it's great for those of us who care more for some of the styles, and nothing for the others. I'm from Brazil and I've taken bellydance classes, and I go salsa dancing with my boyfriend all the time. Elsa's energy is just perfect for these styles that I'm very familiar with, actually, her hips are awesome, that's how it's supposed to be done. The section I liked the least was the flamenco workout, but I do understand that it's a workout, not a learning technique for those who want to perform. Her performances were right on. She kept the personality of each style intact. Her bellydance performance seems easy, but when I tried to learn it I realized it has a lot of stuff in it, the mazmoudi portion is the best I've seen. In spite of some technical boo-boos (her performances in total darkness, some overexposure here and there) I think this DVD is a 5.",1151798400,17,1023,4.446808510638298
2537188,2,B000EUKRIQ,"but I'll give this two stars, as I can see a specific audience for whom this DVD might be just right.

I've been belly dancing for several years now, and although I'm no professional dancer, I'm familiar with the dance form. I teach a belly dance class, and thought it would be fun to add a little Bollywood. I've been studying flamenco/gypsy dance for a little while, and hoped this DVD would augment that knowledge. And I've always wanted to learn the basics of Latin dance, so this DVD seemed just right.

Well, what a letdown. Elsa's belly dance technique would give any of the instructors I've had a heart attack, particularly those who take Egyptian style seriously. As mentioned, I'm just learning flamenco/gypsy, but my instructor is a phenomenal dancer, and I trust her technique. Elsa definitely has a different style...and I wasn't impressed. Her approach is just a few steps too far from authentic. I was so stunned by her...shall we say, ""unique"" approach to belly dance and flamenco that I'm afraid to consider learning any of the other styles she dances, lest I learn a new dance form in a totally inappropriate manner.

As for the performance dances...I asked my husband to watch the belly dance segment. His first comment was, ""Her hands are really floppy, totally ugly."" (And all he knows about the dance is what he's picked up by being around me!) He watched a bit longer, then said, ""Is she supposed to be a professional? 'Cause she's awful, really bad.""

Sadly, I have to agree. The veil sequence is just Elsa turning, and turning, and turning. And her hands really, truly are limp and uninspired. Maybe the overall routine is repetitive because she hopes to show that you can put together a routine by repeating the same movements over and over again, with just slight variations. Unfortunately, the truth is that, if you *do* put together a routine with the same movements, over and over, it gets repetitive! The Bollywood dance is just plain boring, it's so repetitive. I didn't have the heart to ask my husband to critique it.

That said, I have one positive comment. I love that Elsa doesn't have a so-called ""perfect"" body, and she makes no apologies. You go, Elsa!

There's someone for every DVD, and I'm sure there's someone for whom this DVD is just right. If you'd like a different, dance-based workout -- with the knowledge that you won't be learning correct, authentic technique in at least two of the forms -- this video could be just the ticket. If you'd like to learn something about belly dance or flamenco, steer clear of this DVD.",1151625600,16,2569,4.723214285714286
2537189,4,B000EUKRIQ,"This is a very fun little program that will definitely get your heart pumping and put a smile on your face.  There are a few key moves from each style of dance shown and drilled with a great selection of upbeat music.  Don't expect to become a dancing diva from this DVD because the variety of moves is small, but it IS so much fun.  The steps are simple enough throughout all of the styles for even a klutz like me to follow, though it will take some practice.  I should think it would be good for people interested in dance fitness but scared of some of the choreography out there.  As far as features go, I like that you can pick your own sections and that there is a separate section for learning the steps.  It is also wonderful that you have the option of turning the narration off.  Once you watch an exercise DVD so often and learn it by heart, it is nice to be able to go along with music only.  One negative to this DVD is that I think Elsa has appalling form sometimes.  Her hip movements are very big and very bouncy which can be troublesome for your lower back.  Her students, however, stay more understated and move more safely, so it's best emulate them.  Worth the money for people who enjoy dancing but need simpler movements than usually available in these types of programs.  If you're completely new to this type of movement, though, it might take a couple of runs through the DVD.  I'm still learning it, but I don't find it frustrating at all.  Just fun!",1151020800,74,1476,4.32
2537190,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I was so thrilled to receive this DVD.  It is just what the Universe ordered for me.  Since I am busy teaching bellydance several hours a week it is so wonderful to put a DVD in and have someone teach me.  I absolutely loved all the dance forms in this DVD and how they were presented.  And I worked up a sweat working out with Elsa.  She is very very good.  And extremely talented as shows when she is dancing at the end of the DVD.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to learn how to bellydance, bollywood, salsa, samba or flamenco dances.  And it is a great workout also.  Before you know it the DVD has ended and you get that wonderful chance to watch Elsa perform for you.

Worth every penny and thanx Elso Leandros for doing such a wonderful job on this DVD.

2537211,3,B000EUKRIQ,"Overall, a fun dvd.  I thought that Elsa moves well and is in pretty good shape for a lady who seems to be of a certain age.  She's a decent teacher, and seemed to be having a good time.  Her enthusiasm and passion for dance really come through.

The yarn ball outfit for the samba was a hoot!",1219449600,,293,4.0
2537212,5,B000EUKRIQ,"The tutorial section is excellent, Elsa explains in simple words how to properly position each part of your body in order to follow her dancing steps, and standing with a mirror behind her really helps a lot when you are trying to guess if you should move left or right. I always thought I was beyond hope, but Elsa is a great teacher.  I am looking forward to buying more of her dancing DVD workouts.",1217289600,2,401,4.346666666666667
2537213,2,B000EUKRIQ,"This DVD didn't motivate me.  Its not a workout DVD, however if I'm looking to learn dance moves its great!!",1207526400,2,108,4.4
2537214,1,B000EUKRIQ,"I got this DVD because I had an interest in at least three of the styles presented.  If nothing else, hey, the demonstrations would be worth the money, right?

It's my habit to always view the demonstrations first to get an idea of the instructor's style.  In this case, it was a mistake.  The demonstrations are set against a solid black background.  In the Bollywood and flamenco portions, half of her body just blends right into the non-existent background!  The remainder of her body appears (shallow as it seems) to be in a shape that is uninspiring in a fitness video.  It's nice to see some change from hardbodies, but her costumes do not flatter her fitness level and in the case of Bollywood and samba in particular appear to have been designed for someone much younger with very poor taste.  (Honestly.  Yarn balls?)  She doesn't seem engaged in most of the dances and doesn't have the fluidity that you'd expect to see in someone with her advertised experience.

In the warmup portion, she appears old and tired much of the time.  She calls moves without having explained them, so it helps to watch the DVD at least once before attempting to follow it.  The angle is set and kind of awkward for much of the warmup, somewhere between a full-front and front-left, and it makes it difficult to see the mechanics of some of the moves.  Her assistants frequently lost her rhythm.

To be honest, by the end of the warmup, I was so disgusted that I just stopped the DVD and went on to something else.  Perhaps everything improves in the workouts themselves, but I don't have enough interest left in it to find out.",1207440000,7,1618,4.585365853658536
2537215,2,B000EUKRIQ,"I got this dvd because I was interested in learning some very basic, but authentic, steps in different dance styles, and get a fun workout at the same time. If you are seeking the same things, don't waste your time with this dvd. I've studied flamenco dance for several years, and the ""flamenco"" she demonstrates is not only partially authentic at best, but her style is not good. I figured that the other styles were demonstrated in a similarly flawed fashion, so lost interest.

If your goal is simply to get a new and fun workout, the dvd is somewhat more successful. I had a problem however with her demonstration, because she does it facing the viewer - and anyone who's taken dance classes knows that the instructor faces the mirror, not the viewer. This way you can imitate the steps easily without have to transpose them in your mind first. Personally, I found it frustrating.",1184457600,12,884,4.666666666666667
2537216,3,B000EUKRIQ,"The exercises and different dances were pretty cool....but honestly, its not on my top list of exercise dvds...I didn't get in the flow and motivation like I have with my other exercise dvds",1178841600,5,190,4.787878787878788
2537217,3,B000EUKRIQ,"I purchased this DVD because it has a variety of dances in it and I really wanted a good workout that was fun.  I like that this program is fun and especially like the Flamenco.  I love the warm-up because it really stretches my back and hip area.  I didn't need to do the tutorial to figure out the dance moves and have never watched Elsa's performance.

I thought some of the transitions between moves where they spliced together the DVD were not smooth, so I get messed up at those places.  During Bollywood, she says ""Your paradise to...(two names inaudible to me)"" and in the cool down, she says something about touching the temple walls, so I wonder what she's getting to by saying those things.  It didn't give me as good of a cardio workout as I had hoped and I also noticed that Elsa isn't as tone as I'd expect an instructor to be, so I added Jamie Brenkus's ""8 Min. Abs"" and ""8 Min. Buns"" from the ""8 Minute Workouts"" series to my routine (it's old, but good).",1178150400,8,971,4.3076923076923075
2537218,2,B000EUKRIQ,"It seems this DVD put together by amateurs - it is organised quite clearly, but is very bland with predominantly one camera angle (as though the camera was left on a tripod while the instructor danced her routine).  The instructions are fairly clear as well, but overall quite uninspiring.  I normally am easily moved to dance, and I expected this DVD (at a minimum) to motivate me, but instead found myself bored and discouraged.  I am regretful that I wasted my money.",1174867200,12,470,4.7073170731707314
2537219,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I use this for days when I don't feel like working out and yet know I need to get off the couch and get my body moving. It's highly accessible, simple and sooooo much fun. Moreover, although it's hardly a full scope of all the styles it's made it easier to step into other world dance classes. (I'm the star of my salsa class for example, and am now really into flamenco). Elsa is very apprachable and really seems to be enjoying herself and aesthetically it works very much like a real dance class...the dancers aren't overdressed, exorbitantly skinny and their smiles are genuine rather than caked.

Of all my workout videos this one definitely gets the most mileage!",1173312000,9,669,4.621848739495798
2537230,4,B000EUKRIQ,"I really enjoyed the variety of dance styles and the quality of the teaching(thank goodness it's not cheesy).

The DVD has separate ""teaching"" sections where she demonstrates each move (it was slow enough for me, but my mom uses the slow-motion feature on our dvd player to watch this section), and then a separate ""workout"" section where you are constantly moving .  I like how the demo section is separate from the workout so the workout doesn't feel slow and bogged down.
Also, the DVD has the option of doing ""music only"" during the workout so once you get the hang of the moves you can perform them without the verbal cues.

I liked how the instructor was in form fitting but not overly-revealing or gaudy clothes.  It was easy to see her body movements without feeling like watching a stripper.

Two minor things that I found annoying about this video:
1. The instructor doesn't talk at all, she has a plastic smile and gestures with her hands like an airline stewardess while a voice narrates what to do.  (But the voiceover does give clear cues).
2.  The two girls in the background look very awkward, but it is easy to ignore them and instead just focus on the instructor who has decent form.

2537231,5,B000EUKRIQ,"This is a nice little dvd. Leandros gives basic rundowns of a number of dance styles: Bellydance, bellydance shimmies, samba, salsa, bollywood, flamenco.
She gives decent instruction on how to do popular steps and moves with each type of dance, and explains, for example, bellydance moves are more isolated. She shows examples of wrong moves, too, which is just as helpful as seeing moves done the right way.
She dresses in simple shirt and flowy pants, so the moves are not obscured by a flashy costume, and she does the instructional moves in front of a mirror so the viewer automatically gets another viewpoint. During the workout portion, she has two girls dancing with her in the background (though I believe there are four and they are substituted for various styles, edited in, if you will, as all have long dark hair and more olive-skinned complexions, such as the girl who looks like she has more of an Indian heritage is in the background of the bollywood segment) , and their moves are a little toned down, so novices can eyeball their moves as a guide.
The dance segments can be done all one after another or you can customize what order you want or what you want to skip or repeat. The tutorials are one section of the dvd, and you can jump around those, too, to focus on one more than another, and the lessons can be a workout in themselves. But it's nice that you can customize your workout to do whatever in whichever order you wish, so it's nice to be able to, for example, do 8 minutes of samba and 7 minutes of flamenco if you want a quickie, which is what I like about the DVD.
She has a warmup (which is mostly bellydance inspired moves, but you get a good stretch and warmup with them) and a cooldown (again, mostly bellydance inspired) and you can watch her dance in different costumes to the styles featured on the dvd. On this I just want to say I wish she had chosen not to dance in that dress which looks like a crazy craft project, some sheath with pom-poms of many colors attached. It only makes me think of fabric store scraps,dollar grab bags for kids and hot-glue guns and not particularly of dance.
If you're well versed in most forms of dance you may not find this helpful, but if you want a bit of variety in workouts and want to learn a few salsa, samba, flamenco, etc., moves, this is a good place to start. If you feel like you have two left feet it's also a good place to start, making what may have seemed impossible a little easier to grasp. And I like the option that you can work out to the music alone, as the selection is very good, and it's nice to hear the different styles and dance along to just music and forget about the voiceover once you get used to the moves.
I only have a couple of complaints: One, her bellydancing is by no means the greatest. (I can't judge Latin dance styles so well, but the bellydance lacks something, fluidity perhaps -- compare Elsa's dance to someone like Jillina's, for example, and it's leagues apart). Two, her facial expressions are a bit distracting, as she looks a bit crazed during some segments, like the bollywood part, where her face almost looks masklike and forced, and smiles way too hard sometimes, to the point where it looks painful. I imagine she fancies herself looking theatrical and getting into the spirit of things, but for me it took a bit to get past it.
But overall,I really enjoy this dvd. If I'm feeling lazy I do a segment and get a jolt of energy, and doing the whole thing feels good just to move for the better part of an hour and I get to have a bit of fun in my basement.",1167004800,30,3585,4.384384384384385
2537232,1,B000EUKRIQ,"I don't ususally write reviews, but I couldn't possibly keep my mouth shut about this DVD.
This is just an aweful product.  Elsa cannot be a proffesional dancer, she is just awful.  Her hands are way too flimsy.  She reminds me of the wanna-be professional dancers at my family get-togethers.  Not only are the dance steps way too basic to keep the beginner interested for more than a couple of tries, but it's just not good sense to learn from someone who doesn't have decent technique.  You don't want bad habits to rub off on you and then have to unlearn that [...].
It's not even worth returning the DVD.  I only get 50% back because I opened it, and then the shipping fee is taken off my refund.  I may get a dollar back on my credit card if I'm lucky, but I'm still doing it, just on principle.

The bollywood is cheesy but hopping around to it is soooo fun.  The flamenco is fun too, love to stomp around to it when I'm feeling angry.  The warm up is great, not many DVDs have a foot warmup.  The cool down could be longer, so I just do some stuff on my own.  There is stuff on this one that can challenge me and I've done ballet (in my past life) for about 10 years.

I was a bit apprehensive about buying this particular DVD. It just seemed like too many styles. I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. The selection of steps for each style are great. I actually took the time to check Elsa Leandros' biography on the internet because I did not want to rely only on the reviews, whether positive or negative. Her background speaks for itself.

2537237,5,B000EUKRIQ,As a belly dancer I think it's important to constantly review your technique & try to maintain clean lines while performing. Elsa's teaching format helps me focus on all of this while giving me a fun workout. In addition I am able to incorporate some movements from other dance styles which I like to do to add some spice to my performances. I really love the music and Elsa's down-to-earth personality. She is able to dissect more intricate movements and communicate them step-by-step. It's also great to see all of the moves unite into a well-done performance at the end of each segment.,1162252800,7,589,4.728155339805825

Well, almost all, I know it's missing the Polynesian, and the African and what not, but it does offer a whole bunch of different dance styles!  I like the fact that Elsa repeats each movement over and over, and then you go back to the basic steps in between. It prevents me from stopping the workout and pausing and going back to get the steps right and figure out what I'm supposed to do. Also, the ladies (the instructor and the others) are not wearing tight clothes showing their perfect bodies, making me feel less than adequate in the physique department. They are all slim and attractive and they wear these comfortable outfits, like something I could wear. I'm still indecisive about the styles, but I do know I love to salsa!!

Now that I've gotten my feet wet, by myself in the privacy of my own home, I'm going to get myself a partner and buy one of those other DVDs that teach you the whole thing so that I can go out dancing!!!.....",1157587200,24,1072,4.3283582089552235

I am fascinated by different cultures and I happen to like the different selections that Elsa has chosen to turn into 8 minute workouts.  At first I only did my favorites, belly dancing and Bollywood, which I thought were the most feminine.  As I put more effort into the Flemenco and Samba (which I think are the most difficult), I found myself also enjoying them too.  The music is stimulating, no elevator music in this dvd. I know I can not look like some one who has been dancing as many years as Elsa has but it is fun!  I did find it rather odd that she never speaks that it is a voice over.

With World Dance Workout , I just put it in Dvdplayer and before I know it, I've gone through all the segments and I'm sweating.

It was quite a surprise that she came out, after all this years, with a DVD. I tried taking classes with her, back when I lived in New York city, but they were too hard for me at the time. Her DVD is really good. I had no idea she could also do those other styles. In my opinion, however, I wish she'd just stuck to bellydancing for this DVD.

I really don't care for salsa at all, and for samba I already have other DVDs. Flamenco is OK but it just isn't me. I'm also taking away a star because the cooldown is not that great, sorry Elsa. Anyway, it wasn't a waste of money.",1154736000,6,729,4.133802816901408

 I can see why she teaches this program at the United Nations. Elsa is a seasoned dancer and teacher, as I can read in her biography, with the expertise that only comes with all the dance training from master teachers and the professional experience of working with the likes of the Gypsy Kings. Her choreographies, even though short, and I can see Elsa tried to keep them low-keyed because it seems that the main reason for them was to show the workout steps in action, were perfect.

 I'd like to make an observation, being one of those people who like to read the reviews costumers post. I have noticed that whenever a DVD does really well, especially in the latin division, the lady artists get some undeserved extremely negative comments (Kathy Smith, Gloria Quinlan, Liza Nunziella, etc, etc). And, (I'm only speculating)I wonder if the competition has anything to do with it.

Elsa's movements in all but the Flamenco are not true to form and not in the least bit fluid, they are jerky and spasmodic. I love performances and these made me nervous to watch and I felt embarrassed for her.

Great dancer that she is, she handles each dance quite well and she keeps the ""flavor"" of each intact. I tried to follow the workouts, but I found myself going back to the instructional part of the DVD. It did make it a lot easier for me to learn the steps. Elsa looks like she's having fun in the workouts with her beautiful smile and energy, and yet, you don't have to hear the constant words of encouragement you hear on other DVDs.

As a belly dancer I wanted to get my feet wet with Bollywood while exploring other styles like Salsa & Flamenco. Elsa breaks down each step thoroughly making them easier to follow. Elsa's fun and innovative teaching style makes learning exciting and memorable. I like that each dance style is taught separately and she goes one step further by breaking down each step slowly. I wanted to incorporate some fusion into my belly dancing so Elsa provides some great moves and unites them gracefully in her performances for each dance style. As well, this DVD is perfect for beginner dancers, providing just the right amount of challenge to keep those calories burning.",1153008000,9,895,4.743589743589744
2537257,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I'm so glad I got this DVD. It's the most complete I have seen on the market, so far. There is enough material for practically everyone, not impossible for beginners, but challenging enough for those of us with some dance background, bellydancing in my case.

 Elsa is excellent. She has this great authentic smile and energy about her. That, combined with some really good music makes this workout lots of fun.

 What I see that that makes it complete, besides the workout itself, is the following features: a separate instructional that brakes down the movements, preventing having to stop or pause during the workout itself. You can also pick and choose the style you're interested in and, the music only option.

 Elsa's performances are very short, but somehow she manages to include not only the steps in the workout, but a whole bunch of non-generic moves. I agree with the person who made the comment about the bellydance looking easy but loaded with stuff. And yes, the mazmoudi is exquisite.

 I highly recommend it, it's unique and fun.",1152748800,11,1047,4.842696629213483
2537258,4,B000EUKRIQ,"My daughter gave me this dvd and I really like it! The steps are simple and easy to follow. The movements are fun and Elsa looks like she's having fun.  As a recreational dancer, I learned the movements quickly and was able to follow along. I recommend it!",1152662400,7,256,4.333333333333333
2537259,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I must be the queen of dance-based DVDs. I bought too many and promised myself ""never again, enough"". However, when I saw Worlddance Workout, I figured, being a multi-tasker and cost-effective type of person, to give it a try, because of all the styles it offers.

Unlike most of these women making comments, I am not a professional dancer, or dancer what-to-be. Never took a bellydance class and never will. Like to watch flamenco but never picture myself doing it. Took a few salsa lessons that where disastrous, zero experience with samba and never heard of the term bollywood until now.

That being said I will just tell you that I truly like this DVD. For one thing, it did make me feel like following it rather than grabbing a bucket of popcorn and watching it. The reason? First of all, the music is great.

The changes come right on time before I get bored with each style, and neither Elsa nor the people dancing with her are obnoxious. Most importantly, I don't have to hear somebody repeat the same thing over and over and because it's all a voice-over, I don't see Elsa moving her lips when I choose music only. To those who go on and on commenting on her performances, I have one word for them:  BONUS, sort of a freebie done at the end of the workout. You don't look at a gift horse in the mouth. I couldn't care less if Elsa was the greatest dancer in the world or not. All I know is that I can actually move to this workout and that's all that matters to me.",1151971200,29,1474,4.349090909090909
8114625,1,B000EUKRIQ,Unfortunately one cannot see the moves of Elsa's feet as she wears loose black trousers. The dvd is quote old. I'm disappointed...,1456444800,,130,4.954545454545454
8114626,2,B000EUKRIQ,"Eh, there are better dance workouts out there. The steps are broken down but not a lot of focused variety. A put together collection of the very basics from several times of traditional dance. It wasn't really a dance workout for me.",1428624000,,233,4.571428571428571

8114634,5,B000EUKRIQ,"I've bought tons of video workouts throughout my life, and this by far is the best ever.  It is really easy to follow and fun to do. All the dances involved (Bellydance, Bollywood, Salsa, Samba, and Flamenco) make it so much fun that it doesn't even feel like exercise (although I was huffing and puffing at times). It has great warm-up and cool-down sections as well.  This video is worth the money and I highly recommend it.",1229385600,4,426,4.51948051948052
