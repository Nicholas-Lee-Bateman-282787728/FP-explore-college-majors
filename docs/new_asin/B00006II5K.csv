1776325,4,B00006II5K,"The Wong series is a wonderful addition to your amazing collection. They don't make movies like these anymore, now the industry is focused on special effects, instead of acting and strong plot lines. Thanks for supporting the oldies.",1389052800,,233,5.157894736842105
1776326,4,B00006II5K,But I enjoy the atmosphere of old black and white thrillers. The acting of Boris Karloff and company is an added bonus.,1370908800,,119,4.454545454545454
1776327,3,B00006II5K,Not as good as some of the other old mystery movies.  Guessed the bad guy half way through.  Good for a rainy afternoon,1360454400,,119,4.130434782608695
1776328,3,B00006II5K,"Mr. Wong in Chinatown, 1939 film

The film begins with a view of a famous tower in San Francisco. A woman enters Mr. Wong's home, but won't give her name. A window opens silently, the woman grasps her neck, scribbles a note, and falls. A poison dart! The police are called. That dart came from a Chinese sleeve gun. There is a nosy reporter, Roberta Logan, who knows about Princess Lin Hwa. The police go to inspect the ship that brought Princess Lin to San Francisco. We hear about the plot to defraud the Princess. Reporter Roberta checks an apartment. So does a masked man. Next Captain Street of the police and Wong arrive to find Roberta. ""I don't know anything"" says Princess Lin's companion. A mute dwarf shows up; he won't speak except by sign language. Wong seeks advice from a wise man in Chinatown. The Princess came to America to buy war materiel; she has failed in her mission. Back at the apartment the companion of the Princess is now dead, yet no one entered by the door. [An open window.]

James Lee Wong visits Davidson, the bank officer who tells of the Princess' financial dealings. She took out the rest of her funds yesterday, before she was killed. Wong leaves the bank. ""Follow that cab!"" Roberta helps Wong escape just in time, then calls in the story. Captain Jackson of Phelps Aviation gets a visit from Wong, and talks. Was the secret sale of airplanes the cause of the Princess' death? Wong talks with Captain Street. Wong finds a discrepancy in the Chinese signatures of Princess Hwa. They learn about that Los Angeles aviation company. Wong visits Davidson at his estate about those checks. At night three men visit the Davidson estate to ask about the Princess' money. ""Talk and talk fast!"" Can Davidson lure Wong to a meeting? Will they be captured? Roberta Logan recognizes a strange man. The police arrive in time. Who got the money? Wong accuses a man of murder and fraud. He escapes by jumping overboard, but is caught. Wong explains his solution of the crime.

I think scenes were deleted from this 63 minute movie. This low-budget movie is still worth viewing for the story and the background of that era. The story about buying war materiel references the Japanese war on China in the late 1930s. America was neutral and could not allow selling war materiel to a belligerent. Did this cause some deletions to this movie?",1310947200,,2360,4.654676258992806
1776329,5,B00006II5K,"Boris Karloff must have been one of the nicest gentlemen in Hollywood during these early crazy days. It's so wonderful to see him in less makeup and not having to speak in a fractured Chinese accent. His character is very kind and very intelligent. I would like to find some of the old ""Collier's"" magazine stories that the movies were based on to see how they adapted the character to film. The movies were also made with well-spoken Chinese actors, only a few of the men servants spoke with a fratured English, but I work with many heavy accented folks who have lived in the US for over 40 years. The characters weren't too drippy and the plot line was plausible. The times didn't call for lots of gore, so you won't see blood oozing all over as in todays films. I intend to complete the ""Mr. Wong"" series as soon as I can.",1167868800,11,825,4.363636363636363

One of my favorite Mr. Wong movies and the basis for the Charlie Chan remake done more than 10 years later.  Boris Karloff is better in ""Charlie Chan at the Opera"" but his versatility as an actor is in full display here.  He plays an intelligent and sophisticated Asian detective with a British education.  The story line is solid and Marjorie Reynolds adds a good deal here as well.  Definitely worth seeing once if you're a fan of detective movies or film noir.",1435276800,3,605,4.414414414414415

1776417,4,B00006II5K,"After watching Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto my soul is in peril anyway. Like I said about those other B movie series. The racism is almost made up for by the fact that the Asian charterers are the smartest people on the screen. Well the Caucasians playing Asians.
The difference in this one is that Mr Wong doesn't speak with an Asian accent and wears little make up and is basically the old junkie AKA Boris Karloff. (if the movie Ed Wood is to be believed.) So an eastern European accent.  And Mr. Wong doesn't seem to do much detecting. Everything happens around him and by the end the convoluted who done it kind of resolves itself.

It's kind of funny having Boris Karlov portraying a Chinese-Hawaiian detective, but at least there are some token Chinese in the movie. The music is a little goofy, too. But aside from that, it's entertaining for what it is. You may want a grain of salt (or a salt shaker), but it's kind of fun to watch.",1400198400,,403,4.45945945945946
