3765958,4,B001QMCJ5K,"This is the closest I've come to an Ed Wood movie, that is not an Ed Wood movie.  If your tastes, like mine, tend to favor the absurd and unintentionally  hilarious, from time to time, I highly recommend Abar: Black Superman.  Prominent black family move into an upscale white  neighborhood  with John Waters / Ed Wood resulting mayhem.  I'm not going to get into the plot, no more than I would try to explain the logic behind Plan 9 From Outer Space or why I love that film, I simply do.  Watching Black Superman gives me that great feeling that I am watching TV at 3 in the morning no matter when I am watching it and that my friends, is something that could only be said of an Ed Wood film, prior to my discovery of this gem.  Not for everybody, but what truly is?  Warning, print quality source fair to medium, don't expect a crisp clean print.  Oh, and if you are already a fan of this film and are not familiar with Ed Wood, I highly recommend Plan 9 From Outer Space.",1364083200,3,974,4.216216216216216

3765960,5,B001QMCJ5K,This is a great movie especially if you love traveling back to 70's Cinema. Great metaphysical meanings and concepts. A must have for your 70's Soul Cinema collection.,1359244800,5,167,5.0
3765961,3,B001QMCJ5K,"This is an important movie because of the time/place that it takes place. This is post-MLK, post-riots Watts. This film is more about the ideas and needs for protection and understanding in a complicated, changing, and violent world. If you are looking for an action/sexy film, this is not it. This film is one of those movies that people needed to give them hope, and to be reminded of the voice/ambitions and legacy of their real heroes.
It is worth having in your collection if you are a collector, but if you are looking for something like ""Trouble Man"" or ""Shaft"" this is not the movie for you.",1357430400,3,599,4.555555555555555
3765962,5,B001QMCJ5K,"It's like most of your atypical blaxploitation films. Blacks uniting to clean up their neighbourhood and to eliminate racism. What this film brings to the table that no other film does, the insane powers Abar attains. I'm not going to spoil anything but the last 30 minutes and the neighbour's secret make this well worth the $5 + shipping I paid for this film.",1339027200,6,361,4.65625
3765963,2,B001QMCJ5K,"""Abar: Black Superman"" is a film that could have only been made in the 1970s: nobody (well nobody in mainstream Hollywood, anyway) would dream of touching this today. The basic theme of Frank Packard's masterpiece revolves around the disaffection felt by minorities in the 1970s, and the perception of radicalization as a solution. The film is interesting to watch and does make some valid points about race relations. It also goes wildly out of control and gets into truly bizarre science fiction territory before it's over.

Dr. Kinkade (J. Walter Smith,) a brilliant scientist, moves into a very exclusive neighborhood where he is made to feel decidedly unwelcome, first and foremost by hysterical next door neighbor Mabel (Dee Turguand) whose over-the-top dialogue and performance cheapens the social and artistic value of the film immeasurably. The Kinkade family (and their amazingly cool house) are targeted for reprisal through various means that I won't get into here (sadly, I suspect that a real cat may have paid the ultimate price for this piece of art,) most of them fantastically unrealistic for 1977. (Really? A coffin on the lawn?) Tobar Mayo as Abar (I don't know which name is more compelling) and his gang of radicals comes on the scene to protect the Kinkade family, and manages to radicalize Kinkade when his son is killed in front of uncaring neighbors.

Kinkade resists every attempt to root him from his home: the homeowner's association even offers to buy his home with Kinkade getting a 50% profit. Of course even the minority members of the government are accused of being traitors, with poor councilman Mr. Dudley (Art Jackson) bearing the brunt of the assaults. Most of the film is extremely unsubtle, from names for political hacks like Dudley, to having US flags shown with the ""evil"" bankers and politicians (contrasted with the flag of Abar's gang, just to make the point clear.) Perhaps most amazing is the radio news bulletin that you just have to hear yourself to believe.

Dr. Kinkade perfects the bulletproof rabbit (don't ask) and asks Abar to drink an experimental serum that will make him indestructible. Up to this point the film has been mostly a tedious exercise in culture clash, but the serum drinking is really the turning point from political commentary to even weirder political sci-fi. Abar at first refuses to drink the serum, then in a wholly nonsensical scene has a change of heart. Weirdly, Kinkade has been trying to get him to do this very thing for a while and as soon as he does he decides he has to kill Abar. I'm not even going to try to explain this, but it's one of the more ridiculous twists in any film I have ever seen. After the transformation Abar dresses in a suit and mutely controls weather and matter itself (bombs, mice, etc.) with his mind, for justice, of course. The final twenty minutes are highly disjointed and frequently don't embrace any kind of reasonable logic, but at least they are entertaining. This brings me to a major problem with the film: it's plodding. The first hour of the movie is extremely slowly paced and it is frequently downright boring (we get it: Kinkade is persecuted because of his race,) while the ending is vastly more interesting and more compelling (if more logically ill-conceived and confusing.) The film concludes with an amazingly implausible apology and spotlights the major learning point of the film accompanied by Martin Luther King's famous ""I have a dream"" speech (a frequent reference in the film, for understandable reasons.)

The problems with the film are many: the screenplay can charitably be called amateurish with tons of ridiculous dialogue and even more ridiculous acting (at one point Mabel gets the vapors and faints just by looking at her neighbors.) Many plot devices are odd, especially the Wild West dream sequence which must be seen to be believed, and the direction and editing are abysmal. The hit and run incident in which the Kinkade's son is killed is highly spatially-challenged, to say the least. (Just watch it and try to explain the geometry involved.) In short, numerous errors made it into the film which should have been either excised or reshot. Flubbed lines and stilted dialogue are everywhere (at one point Kinkade pleads to his wife ""Please Beth, don't persecute me,"" for instance.) And I'm not even going to mention the worm eating.

The good news is that despite its faults, the historical value of this film makes it interesting for people interested in a genre of film that has become unbelievably tamer in the last forty years. While it's not a good movie in any conventional sense, its value resides in its status as a cultural artifact. It has the added advantage of having a genuinely unique plot twist which has learned from many movies preceding it and formulated something wholly different. If you can get past the atrocious script, direction, acting (only Mayo is remotely convincing here,) this is a viewing experience like no other. As for extras, it even has previews for ""Dolemite!"" If you watch it for the right reasons, you may be pleased, but this one will definitely be a matter of individual taste.",1338076800,17,5171,4.905142857142857
3765964,4,B001QMCJ5K,"This is one of the weirder films of the blaxploitation genre. Part sci-fi, part horror, part social commentary, and typically cartoonish humor. It certainly ain't no 'Shaft' but that's part of the film's charm. If you like 'em a bit strange, this might be something you'd enjoy watching.",1424217600,,287,5.0

3765966,1,B001QMCJ5K,"They don't come much more worse than this 70's blaxploitation film about a black scientist that moves into a bigoted neighborhood and develops a serum which he gives to a big bodyguard who turns into a superhuman hero. The action, photography, sound, music and acting are all below par, but if your thing is watching extremely bad films (the fight scenes are particularly awful, like they were blocked by Stevie Wonder), you can't do much better than this film. All others are warned to stay away. This is not quality entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. As a matter of fact, not much imagination went into making this slice of 70's cheese.",1415404800,,652,4.778761061946903
3765967,2,B001QMCJ5K,I wouldn't recommend it.,1406937600,,24,5.25
3765968,3,B001QMCJ5K,"Of course when you read the title, you a expect wild 70's blaxploitation film about black man transformed into a Superman.  A transformation takes place, but not of the type one would expect!  If you are expecting a Superman to start kicking racists behinds, then you can forget that, Abar was doing that before the transformation.

This film had to make me think way back in my memory banks to see if I saw this one before.  The name sounds remotely  familiar and even parts of the film do, but I am not prepared to officially say that I saw this before.  Then again, maybe I and combining my memories as a child in the 70's with my mother taking me to visit her friends homes - which could be what triggered any familiarities with this film and the black families interior decorating of the 70's, which consisted of oranges, REDS, and avocado green!  You just don't see interiors like that anymore!

All in all it was worth a watch, but the main focus of the film (title) did not really happen and was better left out of it.  It also has some odd dream sequences that were like the story, but in another time in the old west.  This film has your typical Uncle Toms, white racists, black militants and even a Mexican guy acting as a white racist!

Picture quality, this film starts off rough and it is not DVD quality, although the packaging is quality.  The opening scene has many scratches and it was going to look like a very bootleg martial arts DVD, but then it settled down and turned into a poor quality DVD, that was clear enough.  This 4:3 picture was clearly not taken form the actual film (if that even exists) and the sound was what you would expect for this type - bass heavy without detail.  This is good for a watch of third rate blaxploitation films.",1400371200,,1767,4.396923076923077

3765971,3,B001QMCJ5K,while it wasn't a big time film or even given much hype  this film still holds up real well and makes you think and reflect. its not what you think its  gonna be and its a deep film. well put together  and it makes you think.,1388016000,,225,3.847826086956522

8336025,5,B001QMCJ5K,"This is an excellent film! It is a must see. More people should know about this film. It doesn't feature pimps, hustlers, nudity and graphic violence so it has been overlooked. The script is great and well written. It's probably the most intelligent script that I have heard out of all the films in the seventies. This film addresses racism, crooked politicians, crime, ignorance and crooked preachers. You'll enjoy this film if you love films that comment on the ails of society while suggesting intelligent solutions. Highly recommended!
