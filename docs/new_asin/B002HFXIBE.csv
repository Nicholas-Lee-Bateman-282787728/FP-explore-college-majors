8530584,1,B002HFXIBE,"BOUGHT THE SET (9 DVDs) TO SAVE TIME & GET A COMPLETE TRAINING IN BEFORE STARTING A DIVORCE CASE.  PAID THEM $35.91 FOR S/H FOR 9 DVDs.  1ST CLASS MAIL FROM THE EAST COAST GETS HERE IN 3 TO 4 DAYS & WEST COAST 2 TO 3 DAYS AT A COST OF EITHER $0.49 OR LESS THAN $1.00 DEPENDING ON THE PACKAGING.  THEY SENT IT ""MEDIA MAIL"" DELAYING ITS ARRIVAL FOR 10 DAYS.  HOW CAN ONE TRUST A PERSON WHO IS TRAINING YOU ABOUT THE ETHICAL PRACTICE OF DIVORCE LAW WHEN THEY USE SUCH BUSINESS PRACTICES--AND KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW WE NEED THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE PAYING A PRICE THAT SUGGESTS NOT A DOWN GRADE IN MAIL SERVICE, BUT COULD EASILY COVER THE COSTS TWICE OVER OF AN EXPEDITED DELIVERY?!!

HARD TO NOW WATCH SOMEONE I DON'T RESPECT OR TRUST!!!",1403308800,,774,4.238095238095238
8530585,5,B002HFXIBE,"As a family law attorney you're expected to negotiate parenting plans (custody) every day but of course they don't teach that in law school. This seminar fills in a lot of the gaps for me in terms of children's developmental stages and making sure that the parenting plan you help to negotiate not only results in an agreement, but it's an agreement that will last and that will serve the children. The written materials are offered as a free download on the speaker's web site--all 107 pages of them, which was a huge bonus.  Mercer is also the co-author of a well known divorce book, Your Divorce Advisor, along with one of the country's top child psychologists (Marshal Pruett), so she really knows her stuff.",1256601600,,712,4.696
