7969255,5,B00006IJNJ,"This is a classic series from the mid 1960's.  The idea was for two guys, spys that is, would travel the world undercover and on assignment.  What made this unique was the pairing of a black man and a white man as equal partners.  That may sound a little corny now, that it was a big deal.  This was 40 years ago.  I remember watching this as a kid and thinking not of deep sociological factors, but that this was a cool show.  I appreciate the bantering dialogue even more now than then.  The other distinguishing trait of this show was the on location filming from places around the globe.  No stock shots here.  Watch the show that propelled Bill Cosby to fame.  The set Has no special features, but the transfers are very good.  This was TV history, and it is fun to watch.",1172102400,4,777,4.289655172413793
7969256,5,B00006IJNJ,"How often can a television series lay claim to having helped to change television, and, yes, even the world? I Spy did just that. This was the first series to star a White and a Black together, and I Spy marked the first time a Black actor won an Emmy ... three back-to-back Emmys, no less, for Bill Cosby as Best Lead in a Drama. Racial barriers were pushed aside when I Spy hit the air in September 1965. This was also the first series to shoot around the world and ushered in the technology to make that possible - film making techniques that are still used to this day! And this is where the ""buddy picture"" began. ""Miami Vice, ""Starksy & Hutch,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" all owe much to I Spy.

To find out how the makers of this series did it, how they accomplished the near impossible, read ""I Spy: A History and Episode Guide to the Groundbreaking Series"" ... then watch these episodes in a whole new light. They are more historic than you may yet know.

For the three box sets from Image, the DVD transfers are very good; the Robert Culp commentaries are well worth hearing; and you can use the above mentioned book as a guide to the proper order that the episodes were intended to be viewed - which will enhance the viewing experience.

This series should be remembered and cherished. TV was never the same again after it, and, in some ways, either were we.",1171756800,3,1358,4.380952380952381

Although I couldn't understand a whole lot of what was going on, it seemed obvious that the two guys were cool, the places they visited were exciting, and it held my interest. Of course, lots of things can seem interesting to a five-year old. When you get older, and watch something that you haven't seen in thirty years, it's painful, but you're almost resigned to be disappointed. Watching I-Spy now is even more enjoyable than it was then because not only can I understand what's going on, it's still a fun, entertaining show.

We have to remember than when this came out in 1965, it was a HUGE DEAL to have black and white co-stars together in a show. And while it was obvious that the show was cautious about Bill Cosby's role in the beginning, it was obvious even in the very first episodes that he would more than hold his own with Robert Culp. Their byplay, born from genuine, offscreen friendship, is still the gold standard for two-person partners and teams in television and films. Their interaction was natural, spontaneous, and genuine, and no duo has come anywhere close in matching it. If Spenser For Hire had lasted longer, perhaps Robert Urich and Avery Brooks may have come the closest, but no one has managed, not Miami Vice, Lethal Weapon, or any other attempt.

The simple concept of having two globe-trotting spies working together in the guise of a world-class tennis player and his trainer seems so basic, but adding the team of Culp and Cosby, exotic locales, and good directing and editing makes all the difference. A complete first season collection would be better, but this is still a treasured momento from a bygone era.",1163548800,4,1691,4.70945945945946
7969258,5,B00006IJNJ,"Although I think I can remember seeing the opening sequence of 'I Spy' as a child in the sixties ( I probably had to go to bed about that time it was on) it still is a completely new series to me.

I loved Bill Cosby from his comedy show quite a few years ago and wondered what this show could be like and I was not dissapointed and neither will you. You know what a great job the sixties made of Spy and Adventure shows and this is another sixties classic.

Both Bill Cosby and Robert Culp are excellent in this slightly more realistic spy show with great fellow actors and some great comedy too.

It is so refreshing to see Bill Cosby  not cast in a stereotyped black role infact maybe even the leader of the two agents.

Great acting, great stories and great locations and all in full color which suprised me as I thought by the box cover that it was in black and white.

There is much to entertain in this great box set and I for one was so impressed that I will get the rest of the other box sets God willing.",1124409600,6,1014,4.0703517587939695
