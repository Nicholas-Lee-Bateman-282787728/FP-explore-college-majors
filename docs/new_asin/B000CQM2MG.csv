8100410,5,B000CQM2MG,"With the advent of books on the Mudd Club recently, I am so happy to see a documentary on TV party. Every time I watch this I 1) can't believe this was so ahead of its time and 2) that they got away showing this (and smoking this) on air. Ah, I yearn for the DIY days of underground film and television. God Bless Glenn O'Brien and his motley crew. He is missed.",1514592000,,362,3.9726027397260273
8100411,4,B000CQM2MG,This is fantastic film and $20 well spent. Great footage from the forward thinking (while still ramshakle) TV Party show. Not much regarding extras but about an hour and a half of great happenings. I bought this when I saw a young-ish Robert Fripp (of King Crimson) performing with a piecemeal band that included Chris Stein from Blondie on guitar. Awesome stuff.,1153612800,2,363,4.870967741935484
8100412,5,B000CQM2MG,"Having bought a ""Best of TV Party"" VHS a few years ago on Ebay, I was thrilled to see episodes finally being released on DVD and this full length documentary as well.  Like Glenn O'Brien's film ""Downtown '81"", it really captures a moment in time when artists and rock stars converged together to create magic.  If you are a Blondie fan then don't dare pass this up.  Chris Stein & Deborah Harry are in it constantly!  It's amazing that they were able to participate so heavily in the show as it ran during the height of their Blondie fame.

It's highly unlikely anything as cool as TV Party could ever happen again, which make this time machine all the better.",1151193600,3,660,4.466666666666667
8100413,5,B000CQM2MG,"This was fascinating, never seen before footage of Blondie, Basquiat, and George Clinton.  Movie kept my attention the whole time and left me wanting more.  Outstanding editing and directing.  When is part 2 coming out???",1135728000,3,221,5.257142857142857
