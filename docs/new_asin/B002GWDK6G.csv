8370059,4,B002GWDK6G,"My boyfriend is an avid scuba diver.  When I threw a surprise 40th birthday party for him at a friend's bar, I thought it would be a cool background to have playing on the tv's in the bar....rather than some random program or leaving them off.  This was a big hit!",1425340800,,264,4.1568627450980395
8370060,5,B002GWDK6G,This video helps my children relax and unwind at the end of the day. I highly recommend it as soothing background for frazzled kids !,1387324800,,133,4.36
8370061,2,B002GWDK6G,"Not at all what I thought.  I thought it would be underwater scenes only,  It is more of an informational video.  Lovely scenes, but I was looking for more of an aquarium scene only.  I would not recommend this to anyone.",1377216000,,221,4.317073170731708
8370062,5,B002GWDK6G,"I borrowed a copy of this DVD from a local library to view before purchasing one online. The movie, previously shown on PBS, narrates (with background music) the history of planet earth and the evolution of life from the sea --- from single cell to land animals. The video quality is surprisingly of high quality for a standard DVD, showing all kinds of bizarre-looking sea creatures from krill to giant blue whales, in striking vivid colors. My favorite was the graceful jellyfish in Palau. By the end of the feature, the narrator thank god for the creation.(Evolution or creation?) The bonus feature, ""Underwater Adventures"", is a repeat of the main feature with varied background music sans narration. I'll be buying the Blu-ray version of this DVD when its price gets cheaper, just as I did with Discovery's ""Equator: Reefs of Riches"" ($2.69), to enjoy more on my large flat-screen Full-HD TV.",1372204800,2,897,4.947019867549669
8370063,3,B002GWDK6G,"I borrowed this disc to try out my new Panasonic TC-P65VT50. The disc started and a message popped up on screen. ""3D signal detected"". Nothing is mentioned on the disc that this is a 3D blu-ray. I have never seen a 3D movie in the theater or on TV. I put on my new for 2012 Panasonic 3D glasses and was underwhelmed. I put the TV in THX 3D Cinema mode (which only becomes available when a 3D signal is present).This lightens the screen which is good since the glasses are fairly dark. The 3D effect is subtle. There is a feeling of depth in many of the scenes, but not all. Nothing jumps off the screen, this is not Disney World. 3D adds very little to the enjoyment of the disc.
The disc is nice to watch, once. Lots of sea creatures. Beautiful colors. Good music (listened in Logic 7).",1341619200,,787,4.218543046357616
8370064,4,B002GWDK6G,"The main feature is advertised as Dolby 5.1 on the back of the case but it is actually Dolby 2.0. This was very disappointing. It could have been so much better if 5.1. The music is very soothing, is present in the background when there is narration and is clear and crisp. Narration isn't distracting and is educational. At times there isn't any narration with just the music. The picture quality stands out even though 1080i. At times appearing almost 3-dimensional especially in scenes where fish are set against the blue. The only special feature is 59 min. of additional footage most of which is new but some included in the main feature. The video quality isn't of the same caliber as the main feature but still good. It is also Dolby 2.0. There isn't any narration in the special feature, just pleasant music. Overall I am happy with the quality but it really would have made more of an impact with Dolby 5.1. The packaging really needs to be corrected. The credits don't list any of the places where the video was shot. Jellyfish Lake in Palau was obvious, most of the other underwater sequences look like they were filmed possibly off the Great Barrier Reef and either Cozumel or Belize. I really wish they would have included the sites in
the credits.",1256342400,2,1261,4.633928571428571
8370065,1,B002GWDK6G,"This program recorded in SD and sound just 2 channels.
Most TV programs better quality than this.
I have many documentary blu-ray discs and this the worst of all.",1255651200,3,162,4.620689655172414
