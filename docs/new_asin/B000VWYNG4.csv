Remember Music Of Mass Destruction? This is the same concert, but missing some songs, extras, and the bonus audio cd that came with it. Some company that put this out called ""Sbme Special Mkts."" thought they'd make some money. Why settle for the cheaper knock-off when you can get the complete version? The same company also decided to issue Megadeth's Rude Awakening with lesser material simply titled ""Megadeth Live."" Don't even buy Rude Awakening, get That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires.

Think about it if you find this dvd on the shelf somewhere or online, compare it to Music Of Mass Destruction. You'll notice the same songs in the tracklisting even though the knock-off version doesn't have the complete tracklisting, and it's the same venue, which is the Metro in Chicago. Music Of Mass Destruction has 18 songs on the dvd including the two extra songs, and bonus extras featuring 4 different segments that the guys in Anthrax filmed themselves, and a feature on artist Alex Ross, plus the 13-track audio cd of the show. You don't even get that with this one. So, think about it.",1208822400,19,1266,4.677130044843049
