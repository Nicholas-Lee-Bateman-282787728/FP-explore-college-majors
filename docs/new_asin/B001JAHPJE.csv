But that had nothing to do with the series itself, only the quality of the DVD release.  The show was and is a classic and I would love to see the rest of it again.",1528416000,,317,4.080645161290323
8609805,5,B001JAHPJE,"Release the rest of the series! Many of us are older fans who enjoyed the series during its initial run and the first run of reruns! There are so many garbage shows released to DVD, what is the hold up on this classic show? It's a sure fire profit maker, just like other classics from this era. Shout Factory, rescue this series and THE LOVE BOAT, please!!",1522281600,,356,4.3283582089552235
