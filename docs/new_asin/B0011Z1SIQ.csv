What really moved me  was when they had a group meeting and decided to open up a school for their kids-- to be financed by their meager earnings.

3070482,4,B0011Z1SIQ,"To me the beauty of this film is that it uncovers an entire commodity chain  from end to end. You may be astounded at how little you know about coffee and how it gets to your cup. Were you aware, for instance, that ""hand-picked"" means not that the beans were removed from the coffee bush by hand (though they may well have been), but that they were laboriously finger-sorted, one at a time, by people halfway around the world? The film provides glimpses of the various actors involved in this commodity chain, from the farmers to the buyers to the sorters to the importers to the baristas. It even shows participants in a global conference on commodity trading. In doing so it may raise certain questions for you. Why do the Ethiopian farmers, who work so incredibly hard, have almost nothing to show for their labors? How do a few people manage to get so rich from this business? Is there a better way to trade in goods around the world?

My only complaint about this DVD is the annoying message that pops up on screen every 20 minutes warning that the disc is for private home use only, and is not to be shown for commercial or classroom purposes. I've never seen this on any other DVD. So if you are thinking about buying this DVD from Amazon to show in a class, be warned! Instead you will probably have to pay through the nose to get it from California Newsreel, the dirty dogs....",1220313600,10,1386,4.431372549019608
3070483,5,B0011Z1SIQ,"The truth about coffee. In college, I was lucky enough to have some ethical coffee roasters a short walk or bike ride from my house. When I moved away, I was stuck to chose from local coffee houses whose coffee just wasn't that good, so I turned to starbucks, for a rich bold coffee, and I bought in to Starbucks' lies about all of their coffee being fair trade, just not certified, and all of their claims at social responsibility. I was excusing my patronage. This documentary shows you THE TRUTH about coffee. Where it comes from, how its purchased, and what life is like for the coffee growers who are responsible for the beans you use in you daily coffee if you lke coffee (or in your mocha chip frappuccino with whipped cream and extra caramel sauce on top if you don't like coffee).",1217462400,,789,4.448275862068965
3070484,3,B0011Z1SIQ,"As a coffee drinker I've been wanting to see this film for a long time. Having read about it at Ironweed I've been looking for a way to purchase it. Living in post-Katrina New Orleans one does not have the pleasure of many new documentary screenings. I finally found a copy at a Company called California Newsreel and purchased it immediately.

The film gives its viewer a stark view of how an everyday product gets to its end user. Here the product is coffee. Nick and Marc Francis take their audience on quite a journey in a mere 78 minutes. We go from the verdant coffee fields of Ethiopia to the floor of the New York Commodities Market to Italy to London and finally to Cancun for a meeting of the World Trade Organization.

The film follows the struggles of Tedesse Maskela of the Oromia Coffee Growers Cooperative to get a better price for his farmers for the beans they sell. It is a story of the haves and the have nots. Against the beautiful backdrops of Ethiopia we witness first hand the poverty of the growers who are making less and less for a commodity that appears to be only going up in price. The film really gets to you in that the unfairness of the current system really comes into view. There is much more here than the importance of a ""fair trade"" price for a product. This is a narrative concerning the survival of a culture and a way of life.

In a way this is a vibrant picture of the entire third world agricultural system. We would rather provide continuing aid than self reliance. The system has the ability to pull itself up by its bootstraps with true help not handouts. This is the message that Meskela ultimately gets across.

This is an important documentary that needs to be seen by a large group of people. Let's hope the message gets out before its too late.

Wake up and smell the coffee.",1206921600,25,1825,4.419642857142857

8242980,1,B0011Z1SIQ,"Warning!

Though this is a perfect movie for a classroom Economics class, the producers require you to but a $50 copy of the film in order to play this movie in a classroom.

Multiple times throughout the film a strip goes across the top saying that it is illegal to play in a classroom.

Sad, because the message is about awareness of global issues.  Yet the producers are just wanting more money.",1489536000,,398,4.486111111111111

8242982,5,B0011Z1SIQ,I showed this video to my students and we had a great discussion.  They now realize that the coffee we drink from Starbucks is harvested on the backs of the Ethiopian people - at a shameful rate of 3 cents per cup.  See the movie.  It will change your mind about how we consume coffee from countries that pay very little for their work.,1443484800,,336,4.21875

8242986,5,B0011Z1SIQ,Excellent documentary!  Really eye opening and informative.  I enjoyed learning truth regarding anything but especially when companies promote themselves one way but in truth they are shady and manipulating the information fed to the public.

8242987,5,B0011Z1SIQ,"Every purchase we make effects others.  Sometimes the products we use cause suffering for others.  Black Gold is a must see for those of us who buy coffee, which happens to be one of the most commonly exploited commodities.  We must know who is growing the beans for our morning beverage and how these folks are treated.  Your purchase is your vote.  We CAN end unfair labor practices and slavery in our lifetime.",1319932800,,413,4.602739726027397
8242988,5,B0011Z1SIQ,"I admit, I never took the time to really understand what ""Fair Trade"" meant. I see it now and then, but really never paid attention. Turns out, it's a big deal to the farmers and their families, the villages they live in, and Africa as a whole. The major corporate coffee buyers are playing the absolutely typical game of totally screwing the poor and unseen. Vote with your $ - these people are hurting terribly so we can suck down our $3 Starbucks. So the film itself is incredibly well done - flipping back and forth between the barefooted workers, and people hanging out at cafes. It's painful... The only criticism I want to level at this film/ project - is it's website: blackgoldmovie.com -they've abandoned it. the last news is from 2008, and the forums have been disabled or broken... That hurts a bit - I'd like to know that the film is still making the rounds (I just saw it on a local PBS station by accident).",1307318400,,922,4.461538461538462
8242989,5,B0011Z1SIQ,"Ethiopia produces some of the finest coffee available. So why are Ethiopian coffee farmers living in huts with no running water or electricity?
Where is the money going? Black Gold is not a polemic but it does raise some uncomfortable questions about world trade.
It is beautifully filmed and the soundtrack is good too.",1264032000,,320,4.944444444444445
