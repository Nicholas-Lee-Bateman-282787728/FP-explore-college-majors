2684914,4,B000K7VHYG,"Season two of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" saw the beginning of the ""monster of the week"" storytelling that would mar much of the show's last two seasons. Though installments like ""The Sky's on Fire"" and ""The Shape of Doom"" have plots similar to the theatrical film and a first season show, respectively, there is enough originality in the remaining ten to satisfy fan and non-fan alike.

""Terror on Dinosaur Island,"" replete with footage taken from creator Irwin Allen's feature film ""The Lost World,"" benefits from guest star Paul Carr's performance as a crewman obsessed with seeking revenge against Captain Crane who Carr feels is responsible for the death of a fellow sailor. Michael Ansara and John Wayne's son Patrick are both featured in the tense cat-and-mouse episode ""Killers of the Deep"" while perennial heavy Nehemiah Persoff gets to chew the scenery as an escaped convict in ""Deadly Creature Below!"" Robert Loggia plays a scientist determined to retrieve a submerged youth serum at all costs in ""Graveyard of Fear"" and Albert Salmi, who would appear in Allen's ""Lost in Space"" the same year in a similar role, dons a pirate's garb in the enjoyable ""Dead Man's Doubloons.""

""Voyage"" borrows from Agatha Christie in the ""Ten Little Indians""-like ""The Death Ship."" Interesting camerawork and impressive special effects are the highlights of ""The Monster's Web"" and ""The Menfish.""

""The Mechanical Man"" features James Darren as an evil android intent on world domination. Darren would later star in Allen's short-lived series ""The Time Tunnel."" This particular episode is one of the few with a ""special guest star"" in the form of veteran Arthur O'Connell. There is also an eye-popping view of the Seaview as it is hooked to an underwater laboratory.

The major highlights of the disc are ""The Phantom Strikes"" and its sequel ""The Phantom Strikes Again."" Both episodes allow stars Richard Basehart and David Hedison the opportunity to stretch their acting mettle. Alfred Ryder is outstanding as a malevolent spirit determined to possess Captain Crane's body. Even featured player Del Monroe (""Kowalski"") has a ""moment"" in ""The Phantom Strikes.""

As in the other compilations, the special features are at a minimum but the superb sound and color make up for the weaknesses in the ""extras"" department.",1181001600,9,2313,5.1246684350132625
2684915,4,B000K7VHYG,"If you are looking for something that the entire family can watch and enjoy this show is a good one to use; especially if you like the sea and submarines.

It is well written and just a little over acted at times but all in all is a very good show.",1178409600,2,248,3.8627450980392157
2684916,5,B000K7VHYG,"If you grew up watching Richard Basehart and David Hedison in their adventures each week the way I did, you have to love this series and this is one of the best seasons of the entire series to me. Irwin Allen's classic series complete with that ill-fated flying sub that seemed to crash everytime Admiral Nelson went out in it and the constant worry of the Cold War exploding is such fun to watch today.",1176595200,2,403,4.386666666666667

2684918,5,B000K7VHYG,"The first season and this one has re-introduced me to a side to the show I had forgotten was there, mainly the top-quality cast and guest stars.  Though I love original Trek, I think that Voyage's cast was actually more talented.  They just weren't given the material they deserved.  Richard Basehart has always been a favorite of mine, and his Admiral Nelson is the kind of dedicated, dynamic warrior-scientist we wish actually patrolled the seas keeping us safe from everything from enemy super-weapons to natural disasters and even alien invasions through his yankee ingenuity.  David Hedison in contrast plays well off of Basehart with a tasteful restraint and Bob Dowdell is absolutely convincing (and excellently cast) as the ever-reliable XO, Chip Morton.  'Ski, Sharkey, Reilly and the low-key Patterson all interact smoothly and I think the outlandish scripts of this season actually served to bring out their best.  In the episode ""the Shape of Doom"", the heartfelt plea of the whale hunter to Nelson in his quarters may be the single most stand-out moment of this collection (a scene which is sadly wasted on an episode that merely rehashes ""Jonah and the Whale"" from season one).  The FX, as usual, is a mixture of awesome even by today's standards (the ""master"" shots of the Seaview, etc.) and the cheesy FX which were limited by the budgets of the individual episodes for which they were shot.  And I'm sorry to all those who hang their hats on the ""serious"" episodes, but '60s sci-fi is very dated today, and Irwin Allen's spastic thought processes accidentally led to this show still being watcheable now as a kind of grade B adventure with great production values.  The monsters are a hoot and are some of the best in the series.  But yes, towards the end of this set, the drastic drop in quality is impossible to ignore when one compares the rather thoughtful ""Graveyard of Fear"" to the 2-dimensional, ludicrous ""the Men-Fish"".  In later seasons, Basehart would appear to be constantly frustrated while Hedison would seem just plain bored.  Notice, too, how in the monster episodes the monsters themselves are relegated to being the sub-plot (no pun intended)!  But the majority of the episodes hold up and this set is perhaps the highpoint of the show.  Although there would be some good episodes in the last 2 seasons, the show would never again be as consistently good (the aforementioned ""Shape of Doom"" hints at the graveyard of stock-footage to come). Awful scripts that wouldn't even make a pretense of good writing would be so numerous as to drown the few good ones in their midst.",1173398400,17,2607,4.882086167800454
2684919,2,B000K7VHYG,"This will probably be the last volume in this series I will buy. There are two or three decent episodes here, but already you can see the emergence of the ""What got aboard this time?"" cut-rate storytelling that eventually doomed ""Voyage."" In many cases the writing is so hackneyed that character motivations are simply ignored, leaving some show conclusions way up in the air.  Of course, the special effects are still marvelous, even though the same underwater shots are frequently reused. Basehart and Hedison do their best, but by late in the second season the cast had been cut back and Irwin Allen was really playing his big audience for suckers. Of course, he pretty much made a career of that. Even so, I guess I'm still a sucker for ""Voyage,"" which I have loved since the sixties.",1172707200,5,788,4.7101449275362315
2684920,4,B000K7VHYG,"Voyage to the Bottom of the sea is one of those Irwin Allen Shows. You know the shows of this volume are filled with Monsters and Ghosts of World War 2 U-boat commanders.

It is still great storytelling, With all the crap out on TV that is running now,this simple throwback to the monster of week was nice change from CSIs, Law and Orders, Reality shows, News magazines and game shows. The cast of the Seaview battling the bug eyed monsters and weird creatures may seem farfetched escapest entertainment by today's standards, but the quality is there.

And maybe that what we need today. At least I think so

2684921,5,B000K7VHYG,"I just watched the first episode, Terror on Dinosaur Island.  The image impressed me to no end.  The quality is pristine!  It looks like a crystal clear high-definition transfer.  There were lush green plants, sharply defined fog, saturated colors, and the contrast was spot on.  In fact, the image is so superior that you can tell that David Hedison has hazel eyes!  That is how much detail you can see in this image.  The sound quality is equally impressive.  It is distortion free, and free of hiss.  And of course the episode is uncut.  Even the end credits looked brand new.  The image quality of this episode is far superior to the faded and and cut version we saw on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s.

I checked around the rest of the DVD for quality control and found the other episodes to be of similar quality to Terror on Dinosaur Island.  The job Fox did on the DVDs is amazing!  (Thank you Fox!!)

As a reviewer my job is to tell you about the quality of the image and sound; however I am compelled to tell you that the episodes on this volume are some of the finest of the series.  In particular you'll enjoy:

Terror on Dinosaur Island

Deadly Creature Below (this is the View-Master episode by the way)

The Phantom Strikes

The Sky's On Fire

The Return of the Phantom

At the time I read of people who had problems and therefore ran all of the discs through a checker on my PC when they arrived. They were all perfect.

Side A of the first disc of this set now shows a huge number of unreadable sectors.

I am willing to bet this is the exact same problem that afflicted many of the double-sided discs from Universal.

On the whole the episodes are not as good as the first season.  They started to become a bit whacky and most definately solid sci-fi.  However half are great and Alfred Ryder as the ghost of the U.Boat sub is superb!  I love it anyway it was my favourite as a kid.  It's like meeting up with old friends.

2684958,4,B000K7VHYG,"This one has the introduction of the flying sub and some Trek actors. Rodger C. Carmel (Harry Muddd) plays a Russian sub commander.  George Takei(Sulu)plays an rebel leader.  Victor Buno(Villian in many TV shows)plays the android producing mad scientist.  Buno went on to the Tonight show to read poetry on a regular basis. He passed on at the very young age of 42.

I can't believe there was someone behind a type writer making this stuff up. I marvel at how much Irwin Allen got away with before this was canceled in year 4. Just imagine, it lasted a year longer than Star Trek!

Who would of thought how badly this show has aged after the cold war.  It had nothing to do with the cold war after season one.  I can imagine the depression that must have set in when Richard (Admiral Nelson) was fighting giant lobsters instead of Russian sub commanders.
