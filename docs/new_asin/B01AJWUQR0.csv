7606096,1,B01AJWUQR0,"Tha high rating and comments tricked me into buying this low pro film. I suspect people involved with the films making prompted up the rating, and left great comments because this show is just pathetic. It's very low budget, and amateurish. Just horrible.

DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!",1458345600,4,278,4.914893617021277

7606098,5,B01AJWUQR0,"This film delivered big for me.  The suspense built throughout the movie and kept me engaged.  Reminded me of The Babadook which had me on the edge of my seat (this one isn't an Aussie film though).  The similarity was a fresh, new story and an actor who excelled in the part of Marco.  I recommend this horror film to those liking evil entities, the bump in the night, heart-pounding, hide under the covers kind of horror film.  I hope this one delivers to you as it did for me - WOW!",1458172800,2,485,4.228260869565218
7606099,5,B01AJWUQR0,"Remember growing up when you were afraid to go down cellar or when you were absolutely sure theres a boogie man rattling hangers in your closet? The Hours Till Daylight is a ride to this identifiable spooky place, first showing a frightening world through the thoughts and camera point-of-view of young lad, Marco. This 2016 film shows a boy who seemingly lives the American dream in a good suburb, where he wears nice clothes, has a pretty mom and loves his baseball tossing dad. But little Marcos American dream is also a nightmare, which his mom and dad (played by Vannessa Vasquez and Carlos Sepulveda) refuse to acknowledge. Only Marcos sissy, stunningly portrayed by the young Auburn Taylor Thomas, believes him. 30 year old Marco is still afraid of the dark.

I do love a movie that takes me on a trip to a place in America that I don't yet know. This film is a true story set in Corpus Christie, a working class bay town down in south Texas. The Hours Till Daylights beautiful moving images show both Catholic and Mexican folk traditions such as the rosary-like necklace worn in the amazingly acted and executed scene with Dan Braverman, whose character is the Latino healer & witch doctor known to millions of North and South Americans as a Curandero.

We get know the main character Marco by first hearing the frightful, frustrated, and sad boys thoughts and inner prayers (deliciously whispered by the sweet faced and Houston-based child actor Jonathan Carter Thomas). Throughout the picture, the childs thoughts are mixed in with the thoughts and actions of Marco the young family man, powerfully displayed by the believable and remarkable Quinn Allan.  We get to be in protagonist Marcos head with a multitude of scenes showing us his inner world, of both the man and the boy.

This movie has a good dose of darkness and moodiness, especially with so many creepy bedroom scenes (our supposed safe place when we are kids) and then theres that creepy music. Im kinda used to more traditional Hollywood soundtrack in a spooky film, so who knew that church music could actually seem dark and sinister? The church singing and Skip VonKuskes distorted cello music moving in and out of The Hours Till Daylight helped keep me feeling tense in my seat, like I was being warned. Possibly I didn't go to rest room because I might miss something frightening that the music foretold me would surly come.

Its pretty cool that this psychological thriller was written, directed, shot, and produced by indie guy Jon Garcia who until now, has been known for his dramas. The Hours Till Daylight is Garcias fourth full length movie in national distribution following his two love stories, The Falls and The Falls: Testament of Love and Tandem Hearts, his first and wicked cool bohemian lifestyle film set in Portland, Oregon.

The Hours Till Daylight might not feel like a scary movie if you crave mutilated body parts, squirting blood and the like, but if holding your breath or launching popcorn while jumping from your seat sounds entertaining, this movie is for you. I left with a monster feeling to ponder. Just what do you do when a spirit won't leave?",1457308800,4,3152,4.795580110497237
7606100,5,B01AJWUQR0,"Filmmaker Jon Garcia has a penchant for creating intense moments, capturing a potent intimacy among his characters of which the audience can relate (Tandem Hearts, The Falls, The Falls: Testament of Love).  Garcias new film ""The Hours Till Daylight"" expands his repertoire deeply rooted in all things spiritual.  The film commences with lead character Marcos fragmented recollection of his haunted childhood caused by a looming family curse, bringing him much misery as a grown man now starting his own family.  The family curse implies a spiritual malignancy that must be quelled in order for Marco and his family to move forward.  The film is replete with South Texas folklore and Catholic spirituality, culminating into a stark portrayal of both the paranormal and the supernatural.  The accompanying musical score--reminiscent of 70s-era classics Amityville Horror and The Eyes of Laura Mars--sustains the haunting vibe throughout the film with its variation of Gregorian-like chants, church choirs, and droning metallic synth sounds of sheer horror.  This is spooky stuff, especially when you watch it in the dark!  The films title seems to be intentionally metaphorical with an underlying message for all.  Marcos suffering--and that of his family--are directly attributable to a mindset of despair and negativity, which only unleashes more negativity and darkness if passed on to the next generation.  Only when Marco decides to combat his fears--the adversarial curse--does the viewer find reassurance that abundant darkness can always be overcome by light.  The films ending is quite intense and outright terrifying as Marco seizes the moment: his chance for redemption.  The final take away from this film is that if you invite only light and love into your life, this is all you will see.  I highly recommend this film!",1456358400,4,1830,5.337979094076655
7606101,5,B01AJWUQR0,"A very nicely-done paranormal film with just the right amount of substance and foundation. Does the shaky ""hero"" (afraid of the dark, since a child) outwit the terrible spirit which haunts him and his family? I won't give away the ending, but it's well worth the wait!",1456358400,4,268,4.723404255319149
7606102,4,B01AJWUQR0,"This is a very entertaining movie and I liked it a lot.  It is intelligently paced with a solid premise that plays out in unexpected ways.  Marco is a young man contemplating marriage and the arrival of his first born son.  But since childhood he's been plagued by an unsettling sense that there is a presence -- a threatening force -- lingering out of sight but not ever out of earshot or far from his perception.  At night, particularly, he feels the thing nearby.  This makes for some creepy scenes which honestly had my skin prickling at times.  The climax is a meeting between Marco and  a seer who describes just what Marco is facing.  The seer gives a warning: confront and defeat or submit to this nonnhuman force for all eternity.  The film is enriched with the score's use of choral music that recalls a cathedral choir and is in keeping with a religious subtext in which Satan and demonic entities are still active in this modern world ready ensnare or destroy humanity. So the stakes are high. The soundtrack makes ample use too of eerie and metallic noises of the sort you would not want to hear while alone at night.  The main performances were very good. Some of the supporting actors seemed to me wooden and lacking in nuance a characteristic, I think, of indy films.",1456272000,3,1283,4.563318777292577

7606104,4,B01AJWUQR0,"Really exciting ending when he has to face his fears and confront the... scary stuff.  - I'll try not to give too much away.
I liked how the story is rooted all the way back in his childhood.",1456185600,3,191,4.026315789473684
7606105,2,B01AJWUQR0,"I can see what they were trying to do with this, and it would probably appeal to some people, but I wanted more.  This movie was not satisfying at all.  If you want horror, watch something else.",1481328000,3,194,4.216216216216216
7606106,4,B01AJWUQR0,"This is not your run-of-the-mill horror film. It's quiet and paced, and Quinn Allan is absolutely terrific as a young man starting a family while trying to battle his demons. Literally.

I found the story interesting, the cinematography at times just stunning, and it was well-cast and well performed. I don't remember ever crying during a scary movie, but I did during this one. I enjoyed it very much on several different levels. It was worth the watch.",1479772800,,455,4.833333333333333

7606108,4,B01AJWUQR0,"O.K. judging from reviews most people do not like this film. There is no sensational monsters or haunts. This movie is about a spirit attachment where a negative energy makes one family absolutely miserable by attaching itself to the son. Once the son grows up the film goes into depth about a man's attempt to rid the presence and get it out of his life once and for all. There are many theories involving spirit attachment and this movie was pretty much true to life without the hype. About 80% - 90% rings true concerning this rare occurrence.  If you are a believe in such things you will find this movie interesting. If you are looking for a Hollywood type horror movie, this is not a film you will enjoy.",1478390400,3,710,4.461538461538462

7606111,1,B01AJWUQR0,"This movie makes me want to learn some sort of black magic so I can suck an hour and a half of life from the director and add it to my own. For a moment I thought something cool was about to happen in the movie, but I was wrong. Instead, there was just lots of boredom for me and my family. Even the protagonist looks bored. He's supposed to look scared or brave or whatever, I guess, but he just comes across as bored as everyone else. He's probably trying to think of how he will apologize in case anyone recognizes him from this movie.",1477699200,4,538,4.084905660377358

7606119,1,B01AJWUQR0,"wow. this movie was about as entertaining as watching paint dry. I have no idea where all the good reviews came from, but don't believe the hype. also, I am a cynic, so I have to mention that I find it hilarious that both in movies and in real life, people live in sin (according to the bible - like the dude in this movie knocked up his girlfriend who he is not married to, also cusses) but they suddenly turn to Jesus when they want help with something. like why would God/Jesus/The Spook/Whatever come down and help someone with a demon when they don't live a ""holy"" life...? Also, the main dude was such a freaking BABY, like the Ortiz guy told him. Like let your balls drop and handle your childhood phobias like an adult. ugh, just so much wrong with this movie - WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!! I would love a refund for this piece of crap.",1459728000,4,844,4.248447204968944

7606122,1,B01AJWUQR0,"I finished watching this movie with my sister and I felt compelled to write a review because I was also lured in by the decent ratings.

This is a pure snooze-fest and easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It held my interest longer than I anticipated, but there is unfortunately no payoff. The hotel scene, for example, when he begins reading the note from the smoking guy seemed like it would be a great, but nothing happened. You wait for him to lumber very slowly into the adjoining room, but you're left with nothing.

A majority of the film is watching Marco mull around sadly, drink heavily, mumble narration, and make unthrilling attempts to rid himself of this spirit.

In another scene, Marco returns to this house to confront this spirit, meanders around for 10-15 minutes, then the spirit throws a bottle at him and he flees.

The story had great potential, and I forced myself to watch it just because I wanted to see how it ended.

The dialogue is difficult to hear sometimes. Some of the characters seem to have no purpose. He talks to this one guy in a car who hooks him up with this shirtless smoking guy who charges him a ton of money for a piece of paper. But he can't know where the guy is, so this other guy drives him there in a truck ... just typing this sounds like I'm setting up a joke, but I'm not. Then he visits these random people with kids ... there seems no rhyme or reason to much of anything that goes on there.

The climax of the film is laughable and unrewarding. Unrelated, but I cackled when I saw the CGI spirit. It looks like Groot from The Avengers.

I will say that the film has a nifty soundtrack. It reminded me a lot of It Follows. But I wouldn't bother watching the movie for it.",1458432000,6,1740,4.302752293577981
7606123,1,B01AJWUQR0,"A waste of money. Long, drawn out, slow developing story, and a big lack of overall story.",1458432000,6,90,4.352941176470588
7606124,2,B01AJWUQR0,I was duped by the other favorable reviews. Movie is slow and the final battle is anticlimactic. The CGI effects are badly composed. Waste of money. The only good part was the storyline of how the man came to be afraid of the dark in the first place. After that was a borefest.,1458345600,13,277,4.245283018867925

Other reviewers say this movie is slow but the build up is part of the appeal.
I felt like I knew the characters by the time the ""creepy"" stuff really started.
Very real - very believable! (I heard it's based on a true story which makes it even more intense).
I definitely think this is worth your time if you're a scary movie fan.",1494979200,,447,4.518518518518518
