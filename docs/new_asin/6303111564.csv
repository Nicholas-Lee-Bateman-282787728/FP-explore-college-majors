565501,5,6303111564,"The entire Joan Hickson Miss Marple series is superbly done in every way.  Casting is excellent, acting is seamless, the music is enjoyable and  appropriate to every scene and character.  My wife and I view these over  and over again.  In all the productions there is only one we do not care  for and that is in Collection 2: They Do it With Mirrors.  Perhaps there  the story is our problem and not the production.  Otherwise we recommend  every one without reservation and would suggest that others judge for  themselves on the one title we, personally, avoid.",965520000,14,562,4.690721649484536

Agatha Christie's, ""Marple, The Classic Mysteries Collection"" produced by BBC TV in association with A&E Television consists of five discs, each in an individual plastic folder, containing 9 feature length movies staring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. Joan Hickson is by far the only real Miss Marple; she was selected by Agatha Christie and plays the part to perfection. Others have played the part, but regardless of their qualifications as actresses, none of them have surpassed the image of Miss Marple created by Joan Hickson.

The 9 mysteries in this set include:

A Caribbean Mystery (book publication date 1964). Miss Marple's generous nephew Raymond sponsored her vacation in St. Honore in the West Indies. While there she met a crippled irascible millionaire, Jason Rafiel, who would, after his death, get her involved in another case, Nemesis.

The Mirror Cracked from Side to Side (1962). Marina Gregg, a famous movie star, and her husband have just purchased Gossington Hall from Dolly Bantry (The Body in the Library). They hosted the traditional benefit for a local hospital, during which the excitement and clamoring of the crowds masked the horror of the retribution for an unintended exposure to chicken pox that happened many, many years ago. Miss Marple quietly steps in to help.
From Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem, The lady of Shallot:
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried
The Lady of Shallot.

Sleeping Murder (1976). Newlyweds search for a house and find one with more built in memories than they can handle. Miss Marple is called in to help and put things straight.
Edmund Spencer's lines from The Faerie ueene:
""Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas,
Ease after warre, death after life, does greatly please.""

4:50 From Paddington (1957); published in the U.S. as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw.
Not long after leaving the Paddington Station the train that Mrs. McGillicuddy was riding on came parallel to another train on a parallel track traveling at the same speed. Mrs. McGillicuddy could not avoid seeing a man on the parallel train in a First Class compartment with his back to the window strangle a woman to death. She reported the incident to the Conductor on her train, to the station master at her destination and to Jane Marple.

The Moving Finger (1943). Jerry Burton crashes a test plane and is recovering in a house rented in the quiet town of Lymstock with his sister Joanna. They receive a nasty anonymous letter, which harps on the sex theme. Several other villagers have received similar letters as well. Mrs. Dane Calthrop, the vicar's wife, sends a plea for help to her old friend Miss Marple.

At Bertram's Hotel. (1965) In real life it was the Brown's hotel, in London at the corner of Dover and Albemarle streets, in the heart of the West End. Miss Marple is treated to a holiday at Bertram's by her nephew, Raymond. But there is an undercurrent of danger, crime and excitement in the air. Who could be financing and masterminding such a huge operation?

Murder at the Vicarage (1930). The vicarage is situated in Miss Marple's home town, St. Mary Mead. The unpopular Colonel Protheroe is the magistrate and church warden. After considerable wrangling over the making of a nude painting by a artist who works in a small studio on the vicarage grounds, Colonel Protheroe is found murdered on the vicar's desk. Inspector Slack is called in; he and Miss Marple eventually weave the tangled threads of information into a solved murder.

Nemesis (1971). In this year the eighty year old Agatha Christie was made a Dame of the British Empire. Jason Rafiel, whom she met on the island of St. Honore in the Caribbean reaches back from the grave, sends her on a bus trip, and gives her 20,000 pounds to solve a mystery.

They Do It With Mirrors (1952). The story takes place in a large Victorian house, Stonygates, in the small English village of Market Kindle. The rambling mansion is owned by an old friend of Miss Marple, Carrie -Louise Serrocold and her third husband Lewis. The mystery is a bizarre mixture of an extended family life and a reformatory for young criminals where violence is just below the surface.

These are all excellent, exciting movies, I love them all. I have five personal favorites which are: At Bertram's Hotel, The Moving Finger, 4:50 from Paddington, The Mirror Cracked from Side to Side, and Nemesis. Another of my favorites is The Body in the Library which is in another set of three discs, by BBC Video which I will review separately. If you want to have all of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple movies that have been released you must have both this set of nine mysteries and the other set of three mysteries labeled ""Miss Marple, staring Joan Hickson"". A complete collection of great British mystery movies must contain all of the published mysteries of Dame Agatha Christie's two great detectives, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot.",1391731200,,4908,4.87875150060024
565901,5,6303111564,"I have to say I love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  I think out of all of the 'Miss Marple's' she is the very best.  I have watched all of the others and although I do like them, Joan outshines them all by far.  As a big plus this series, to me, also produces the best shows. The actors are marvelous and the sets and scenery are wonderful. The cinematography also provides the sense of reality that I find sadly missing in other versions of Miss Marple. If you love a good 'British' mystery I think you will like these.",1390953600,,519,4.17
565902,2,6303111564,"These were great classics, but this set has been cut, slashed, and murdered!!! It wouldn't take Miss Marple long to warn you to STAY AWAY!!!  My favorite, 4:50 From Paddington, there is so much cut that it makes Lucy look like a guest instead of hired help.
With all the cuts you don't get to know what an awesome and hard working person she is. I could see how some people would be confused about her, the cuts just leave the story flat and strange. Don't waste your money , watch the full episodes on Netflix. There is no way I will order anymore sets because of all the cuts in different episodes.",1390867200,5,600,4.3097345132743365
565903,5,6303111564,"I my opinion Joan Hickson was the best of all the actresses to play Miss Marple.  I never tire of seeing her portrayal of the character.  She projected supreme intelligence combined with genteel manners.  Also the police officers in this her episodes are not bumbling idiots, just not quite as observant as she.  Much attention has been given to creating the feeling of another era, but is not over done.  Clothes, furnishings and cars suggest the era, rather than shout it.  Viewing these episodes will be a pleasure for many years to come.",1390435200,,541,4.763440860215054
565904,5,6303111564,Well done series with good modulation.  Dialog is much more clear on this set and makes it easier to enjoy.,1390262400,,107,4.35
565905,5,6303111564,Confined suddenly to a wheelchair I purchased this series for my mom & she is smiling just like b4 her stroke! Thank you Miss Marple for bringing that smile back to us! A wonderful series that mom does not tire of...the era of this series brings her back to the 'good ole days'. Also bought the Johnny Carson Series [not the infomercial one] from Amazon which has her LOL :) !,1389657600,,376,4.309859154929577
565906,5,6303111564,Always enjoy Agatha Christies work. This series is very good and enjoyable to watch more than once. We enjoy the complex situations and character choices.,1388620800,,154,5.2
565907,5,6303111564,"There have been a couple of fine actresses take up the mantle of Miss Marple in recent years, but they can't hold a candle to Agatha Christie's personal choice, Joan Hickson. Her fierce intelligence and seriousness are exactly what these stories require. If you haven't seen Miss Hickson's Miss Marple, drop everything and do it now. The only issue is the murky, fuzzy DVD transfers. I hope these shows are up for Blu Ray remastering soon, as with the Poirot series of David Suchet. P.S. Since I originally wrote this review, the classic Hickson shows have started coming out on Blu Ray in beautiful remasterings. Don't buy this, but start getting the Blu Ray versions instead. Nearly sixty bucks for this set is ridiculous anyway.",1388448000,,731,4.856
565908,3,6303111564,I like Miss Marple and her stories on DVDS.  She is a good actor and never careless and always ready to blame herself as a cover for her snooping.  She always figures out what is going on without disturbing anyone unnecessarily and slips back into the background after giving the police a gentle hint so they could get the credit at the end and she walks harmlessly away after solving the crime for them.,1386979200,,404,4.445945945945946
565949,5,6303111564,"LOVE Ms Marple, she's just awesome! I never get tired of watching her solve crimes.

565951,5,6303111564,My husband and I love the Joan Hickson version of Miss Marple.  It is always fun to watch how people underestimate her.  We have watched every episode multiple times to enjoy and analyze the complexity of the plot lines.,1386374400,,220,4.615384615384615

565957,5,6303111564,Each episode was a delight to watch ... Joan Hickson captures the essence of Miss Marple ... I enjoyed each of the episodes and would suggest that anyone who is a fan of the books about Miss Marple by Agatha Christie give adding this to your library some serious consideration ... I don't think you will be disappointed ... I am truly glad that it is in my collection ... Larry in L.A.,1381017600,,385,4.287671232876712
565958,5,6303111564,I love these old mysteries.  It is a good murder mystery but without the gore. I enjoy mystery but can't take the vivid images of the newer TV shows.,1377388800,,149,4.137931034482759
566018,5,6303111564,Miss Marple portrayed by Jane Hickson is probably the best I have seen. She truly is Miss Marple - an excellent detective mystery!,1377129600,,130,4.695652173913044

FORMAT: PAL Region 2 U.K. Import]"" is the uncut version of the Joan Hickson series.  With this you have to have a multi-regional DVD player.  This product  (Miss Marple set 1) that I bought from amazon.ca in 2012 I found was the 'PBS edited for time restraints' version. I especially liked the movie called ""A Caribbean Mystery"". I had this movie previously in VHS so I KNEW already that in this DVD version there were parts of the movie cut out from this set. If you don't mind that, then this set will be fine for you. If you DON'T like the fact that PBS had to ""edit it for time restraints"" then this WOULD NOT BE the set for you to buy.",1366329600,14,755,4.302816901408451

566024,4,6303111564,"I like this version of Miss Marple since it sticks closely to the book.  Almost 100% like what I imagined with little embellishment.  At 2.5 hours, however, it is kind of slow-paced and put me to sleep in various places.  So far I watched The Sleeping Murder.  The actual novel was extremely scary, not because of anything that happens but because of the implied consequences.  Here, they try to create that atmosphere with Hitchcockian music and a lot of screaming, but it doesn't come out right.  Somehow doesn't seem anyone has figured out the best way to get Miss Marple on the screen.",1361923200,,589,4.669902912621359
566025,3,6303111564,"My wife loves the stories and the wonderful characters and actors. I try to discourage her from watching on our projection screen and limit her viewing to the under 60"" plasma. Larger presentations only highlight the problem with these fairly low quality transfers from VHS to DVD. When you consider the quality of video images that can be provided by many other TV/movie series from the 1980s, this collection ought to be an embarrassment for A&E.  Couldn't spend a few dollars and provide a cleaner and sharper image, eh?",1361923200,,523,4.876404494382022

566107,5,6303111564,"Joan Hickson is the only actress that gets every facet of Christie's Miss Marple across on screen.  Geraldine McEwan, the most recent to attempt Marple, is an atrocity-she plays Miss Marple as an airhead and has one look-the deer in the headlights look.  I think that was supposed to be her ""I've figured it out but no one else has"" look but it didn't work for me.  I did enjoy the highly stylized look of the McEwan productions even if they were a bit overwrought (honestly, no women's breast/bras were ever as pointy at any era in time as portrayed in these productions), but as soon as McEwan enters a scene it all goes sadly wrong.  McEwan's wardrobe was so simplistically stylized it made her even more ridiculous!  (Those horrible little flat wool hats wardrobe had stamped out in every colour were the absolute worst!!!)  If you like her, Angela Lansbury is enjoyable and about 3rd in my rankings as Marple, but she's is too Mary Popkinsish for my taste. Margaret Rutherford is actually quite good, at least she portrays Miss Marple with ""a mind as sharp as a bacon slicer"" but she's still a distant 2nd for me-too manly, physical, and comedic, not demure like one would expect Miss Marple to be after reading a Christie novel.  However, Joan Hickson gets it just right as the little ""package"" you shouldn't judge by its wrapper.  I can definitely see why after seeing Hickson in a play Christie became very desirous of having Hickson play her wonderful sleuth Miss Marple.  Hickson has set the bar very high for any actress wanting to follow in her footsteps.  If I was investing in Miss Marple media productions, I would definitely get all the Hickson ones first!!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caribbean-Mystery-Part-1/dp/B000I67MDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caribbean Mystery Part 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marple-The-Classic-Mysteries-Collection-Caribbean-Mystery-4-50-from-Paddington-Moving-Finger-Nemesis-At-Bertram-s-Hotel-Murder-at-Vicarage-Sleeping-Murder-They-Do-It-with-Mirrors-Mirror-Crack-d-from-Side-to-Side/dp/B000CRR36K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marple: The Classic Mysteries Collection (Caribbean Mystery / 4:50 from Paddington / Moving Finger / Nemesis / At Bertram's Hotel / Murder at Vicarage / Sleeping Murder / They Do It with Mirrors / Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Marple-4-50-from-Paddington/dp/B000MN6XQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Marple: 4:50 from Paddington</a>&nbsp;You will enjoy these faithful productions endlessly rather like Christie's writing itself.

been watching these since PBS had them on,taking them out of the library, and Netflix.
I was very disappointed to put it mildly to notice this, which I did from
watching my favorite ""4:50 from Paddington"" first- they cut the scene of the cluttered kitchen to the pristinely cleaned and ordered kitchen which shows the sharp
and splendidly ordered personality of Lucy Islesborough, the housekeeper
Miss Marple convinced to find the body for her and Elspeth. These various
series produced by the British television companies pay such attention to detail
it really is a necessity to watch them more than once to appreciate it.
Which makes it a shame that scenes are cut from them. This is not the only episode
that this was done, but I will not bore you with a list.
I really don't know how to rate the product since The Marple Mysteries are all
wonderfully done, Joan Hickson is the epitomal Marple, and I will ultimately

I also knew that Joan Hickson was in Murder She Said (Margaret Rutherford); however, I was sadly disappointed just within a few minutes viewing of the first movie in this set.

I found the movies to be slow movie and rather flat; in fact, they literally put me to sleep.  Because I ordered this set, I did force myself to watch them all while my husband was in the hospital, and I also had him watch a few when he returned home.  His reaction was the same as mine.  That was last summer.

I decided to give this set another chance, so I read a story and watched the movie.  I found myself engrossed in the book, but again, I found it difficult to get through the film.  I think it is a combination of things.  First, the actors have no ""chemistry"", that magical thing that makes the screen come alive for me.  Secondly, I really don't care for Joan Hickson; however, I know many love her.

566348,5,6303111564,"Joan Hickson's Miss Marple is by far the best of the species currently on film.  This set from the mid 1980s is the closest yet to the original stories.  It didn't take me long to adjust to Hickson's quietly formidable dragon lady but I was completely won over by her performance.  She easily carries the series on her aged shoulders.

Margaret Rutherford was for so long the only Marple I was acquainted with and those classic movies are hardly close to telling the Marple stories completely.  They are Rutherford vehicles for her to do her hilarious bumbling schtick.  And I still enjoy her four movies more than the latest lame attempt with the great Geraldine McEwen's talents being wasted on very poorly written scripts of almost unrecognizable versions of Agatha Christie's books.

This Hickson series is pretty wonderful.  Great in fact.  It took me awhile to get used to and like the original music.
After watching the mutilated feminist Marple series (McEwen) the change from that excellent score (a big plus to that series) to a more ladylike, lace and baby's breath type musical background was a jolt.  In the end it is a very clever, humorous score and works perfectly for Hickson's character.

Hickson is teamed up with some wonderful English character actors, some at the beginning and some at the end of their careers.

It is a joy to have Joan Greenwood as Selina Hazy At Bertram's Hotel.  This was her next to last film appearance and she turns in one of her classic portrayals that is equally memorable to her Miss Gwendolyn Fairfax (The Importance of Being Earnest) and Mrs Clenham (Little Dorrit), her final film appearance.  Jean Simmons, Rene Asherson and Claire Bloom are among the stellar lineup of leading characters.

This series is filmed on location around England, and one episode in Barbados.  The houses are magnificent, my favorite being Rutherford Hall, the family home of the disfunctional Crackenthorpe clan in 4:50 From Paddington.
And I am used to lots of old train footage in this Masterpiece Theater type series but the true magic of travel around England in the early and mid 20th century has never been caught so vividly as it is here.  Great care has been taken to capture the very atmosphere of London and St Mary Mead and elsewhere.

It is unfortunate that A&E is the company who releases these classic English television series.  They have simply taken the video and transferred it to dvd without any attempt to improve the sound or picture quality.  There are no special features to speak of either.  Just the usual A&E brief, written blurb of the leading actress.  And it's not as if these dvds are cheap either.  At least they are more reasonable than the way over-priced Acorn rip-offs, like Inspector Alleyn, one story per dvd at top dollar and only four dvds in each set (I only bought one because I felt really gipped by Acorn).  Fortunately Hickson's Marple was excellently filmed and recorded and this flat-out transfer to dvd works just fine with a couple of scenes plagued by video streaking, hardly noticeable but evidence that no improvements have been made for the dvd release.  Also, this is not the complete 12 episode series, the missing 3 episodes are available on a BBC dvd set, expensive but the only way to have the complete Hickson Marple.

But I don't think there will be another Marple series that will equal this one, not just because of Joan Hickson's embodiment of this famous but elusive character but because of the superb cinematography, direction, scripts, supporting cast and charming music.

The Hickson series is FAR preferable to the tripe made for McEwen, such a waste of a great actress who might have been as classic a Marple as Joan Hickson if the producers hadn't been so misguided in their attempts to turn Miss Marple's story into feminist tracts and making the eponymous heroine look like Old Mother Hubbard.",1297814400,5,3896,4.828313253012048
566349,5,6303111564,"It is no good for Miss Marple to take a vacation - sorry, holiday - in some distant exotic place like Barbados because crime is following her just the same and she gets mixed in several murders. The gist of the case here is that she was told everything that was going to happen by some kind of blabber mouth of a major of the colonial police, and she did not listen properly, just providing him with the few prompts and cues necessary for him to go on talking. But of course she will manage to prevent the last murder but three people had had it hard in the hands of that murderer. Once again that poor Miss Marple finds herself in a human environment that is not very gratifying for humanity itself: rich self-made men who control people around them with money and nurture that way all kinds and types of jealousy and hatred and that is the real fodder a murderer needs to accomplish his deadly mission which in a way is a cleansing mission in this society. There is some kind of cynicism in Miss Marple and her vision of society as being the real home of all kinds of cankers and rotten apples. And yet she manages to protect these selfish and self-centered individuals. This film was slightly too slow in a way and the Barbados setting was not used as much as it could have been.

In my time, there have been three main portrayals of Christie's competent and cognitive character. Margaret Rutherford played a slightly 'dotty' version excellently. Lately, we have had Geraldine McEwan playing the part superbly well. However, my favourite has always been Joan Hickson's portrayal. Hickson manages, excellently, to maintain the elderly and slightly uncertain character that I feel Christie intended.

Joan Hickson (Miss Marple) is one of my favorite actresses in this role, but she can be quite quiet and this makes it hard to hear what's she said, and this is irritating since it's usually one of the clues that is stumping Chief Inspector Slack.

That's the only irritation I had with the set.

Geraldine McEwan is excellent but the producers obviously thought that could improve on The Queen of Crime's original and, in my opinion, produced a version that may qualify for one star.

Unfortunately these episodes are not complete. These titles were originally shown by the BBC and the Seven Network in Australia as 3 episodes per title, each with their own openings and credits. If you buy the 3 disc set released by the BBC of the three titles not released in this set (Body in the Library; A Murder is Announced; A Pocketful of Rye) you will see that they are in this format and complete.
Sadly, most of the titles in this set seem to have the first episode complete and then the last 2 episodes are cut and hacked together to make a movie length feature. I had a lot of these titles taped off the television and when I got the DVD set I went ahead and wiped them. Imagined my frustration when I realised that many scenes are missing.

Joan Hickson nails Miss Marple as does everyone associated with this series production.  I read all the books before watching the series so I knew what Miss Marple was supposed to be.  This Marple series maintains the integrity of Agatha Christie's writing and that's pretty difficult to do when transferring a book to film.

The sets are sumptuous and we get great views of the English countryside.  Miss Marple is appropriately a spinster with a mind like a steel trap.  She's underestimated by the murderer mainly because no one can believe that a senior citizen can be so smart.  But Jane Marple is just that and she uses the ruse to get information that no police detective could.

I won't go into details about each movie since someone else has done that here.  I will suggest that if you want to really see AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MISS MARPLE, you will buy this set.  The newer Miss Marple with Geraldine McEwan is a major disappointment and totally unrecognizable to Christie's superb writing.",1186272000,3,1103,4.850267379679145

I don't know if we got two from the same bad batch, or what, but now we don't have the set we were looking forward to placing in our video library.",1182816000,23,529,4.377551020408164
566644,5,6303111564,"In ""An Autobiography,"" Agatha Christie wrote, ""Miss Marple insinuated herself so quickly into my life that I hardly noticed her arrival.  I wrote a series of six short stories for a magazine, and chose six people whom I thought might meet once a week in a small village and describe some unsolved crime.  I started with Miss Jane Marple, the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my grandmother's Ealing cronies--old ladies whom I met in so many villages where I had gone to stay as a girl.  Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was.  But one thing she did have in common with her--though a cheerful person, she always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and was, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right....""

Later, Christie added, ""Miss Marple was born a the age of sixty-five to seventy--which, as with Poirot, proved most unfortunate, because she was gong to have to last a long time in my life.  If I had had any second sight, I would have provided myself with a precocious schoolboy as my first detective; then he would have grown old with me.""

There you have the most authoritative pronouncement on the nature and character of Miss Jane Marple--and here, in this series, we have that fussy and spinsterish old lady's most authoritative portrayal.

Major actresses have offered famous performances of a mystery-solving elderly lady named Marple--Margaret Rutherford, Helen Hayes, Angela Lansbury and, as I write this, Geraldine McEwan.  Some have been quite good in their versions of Miss Marple.  Margaret Rutherford, in fact, was simply wonderful.

However, not one portrayed Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.  None of these fine actresses was able to resist the urge to twinkle--to give just a hint of knowing glee, to be lovable.  Agatha Christie's Miss Marple does not, and never did, twinkle.  Though a cheerful person, you see, she always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and was, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right; there wasn't a twinkle in her.

Joan Hickson never twinkles, not once.  She is Christie's fussy, spinsterish old lady down to her bones.  She is sometimes Nemesis and someetimes, as Detective Inspector, later Superintendent Slack so acutely points out, a grey-haired cobra.  Joan Hickson inhabits the character of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple so completely that I find it shocking when I see her in another role, for she usually portrayed brassy, hard-edged women who couldn't possibly have been more unlike the old maid of St. Mary Mead.

Joan Hickson is the pearl in this oyster, but these BBC productions from the 1980s have other merits.  Wholly unlike the current series that is so carelessly stomping on memories of Christie and Marple, alike, the writers in the 1980s actually seem to held Dame Aggie in respect.  Practical considerations did not allow them to transfer Christie's every word and situation to the screen, but they did manage to transfer her spirit and tone with remarkable fidelity.  These dramatizations of Christie's novels almost always feel right, even when they depart from the originals.

Just as there is a tone in the writing, there is a tone in the acting.  At some time in pre-production, it must have been decided that all parts would be played straight.  No character was to be a ""type"" or caricature--not the half-ga-ga clergyman at Bertram's Hotel nor the superannuated Bright Young Thing also in residence there, not the huntin' and shootin' local squire who awakes to be informed that there is a dead body in his library, not even the kindly village rector with the corpse littering his vicarage.  The decision made, it was obviously rigidly enforced, for none of the fine British actors, some of them notorious hams, ever steps out of character.  The gap between this approach and that taken by the current, McEwan series could not be wider.

Finally, there is the matter of the setting.  Both the Hickson series and the McEwan series are notionally set within a year or two of 1955.  The current series forcefully thrusts the era into the laps of its viewers.  In the recent version of ""4:50 from Paddington,"" for example, there is a wholly gratuitous scene in which Noel Coward (no less) is performing at the piano for a small party in his digs at which Lord Mountbatton (""Dickie"") is present.  The Hickson series is infinitely more subtle; there is an underlying and pervasive air of the era's austere scrimping and saving as part of the daily routine.  It is hardly noticeable--and all the more effective for that reason.

Other reviewers have brought up matters of interest with regard to edits and formats, so there should be a buyer beware warniong, at least for some purchasers.  My own reaction to this version of the Hickson series is that it perfectly acceptable to my personal requirements.  Others might feel differently.

My rating relates to the writing, production and acting found in this series: five stars without doubt or hesitation.",1180656000,19,5088,4.950530035335689

Whilst the stories are there to be enjoyed, we have been extremely disappointed by the drastic cuts that have been inflicted on all the stories we have watched so far.

For instance in 'The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side' 11 minutes of footage has been cut from the VHS version.  Whilst 11 minutes may not sound a lot, in the uncut VHS version of the same story it does include critical moments which genuinely add to the story.

566748,5,6303111564,"Joan Hickson gives THE definitive portrayal of Miss Marple in this series ... what more can one say?

The image quality of this series is excellent.  The previous reviewer who cites image problems must have

received a defective disc set or have TV problems.  (Likely, the contrast is set way too high

on his TV, a common problem).  After receiving my DVDs I specifically searched the

""At Bertram's Hotel"" episode for the ""dark"" problems he cites, and could find NO such problems at all.  The

image quality is beautiful.

It is true that in the  ""Bertram's"" episode  there are some warm color effects, but those are purposefully done as

part of the cinematography, and none of them are ""dark"" anyway.  The only ""dark"" scenes are night scenes

which are supposed to be dark.  I could find no place at which the image was difficult to discern, or at

which there was any technical problem.

Technical note--  Being a filmmaker myself, I will add this technical note, in layman's terms:  This series was made in the 1980s (for the most part), and

during that time it was still customary to edit filmed programs on *film* (not video).  That is, the camera negative was actually edited, and a positive film *print* was made from that.  This positive film print was then transferred to video for broadcast transmission.

Today, however, the process is different.  Today, the camera negative itself is first transferred to video, and then

the program is edited using that *video*.  Once edited,  a digital master is made,  **skipping entirely the

positive print stage**.  This results in the slightly (and I emphasize SLIGHTLY) sharper image of modern

programs, and the modern ""look"" that viewers have come to expect out of today's programs.

However, it does NOT mean that anything was ""wrong"" with the way they did things in the 80s.  It just results

in a different ""look"" or perhaps ""feel"" to the image. Today,  post production processes have evolved to the point where it is no longer necessary to make a

positive print, thus the video comes straight off of the negative, and is just a bit sharper for that reason.

For a series that was produced on 16mm during the 1980s, these Hickson Marple shows look just fine, and are comparable (image-wise) with any other prime time 16mm material from that period.

In short, there is nothing wrong with the image quality on these DVD sets.

The newer Geraldine McEwen series is (as one would expect) transferred straight off of the camera negative,

and therefore looks more ""modern"".  However, the McEwen series just does not hold a candle to the writing, production, and performances in the classic Joan Hickson programs.

By all means, grab these Hickson programs while you can!

Ms. Hickson continues to hold top honors as THE definitive filmic Miss Marple.",1114560000,28,2810,4.849894291754757
566749,5,6303111564,"When Joan Hickson was in her forties, Agatha Christie visited her backstage after a performance and told her, ""I want you to play my Miss Marple when you're old enough."" And to our great benefit, the late Ms Hickson did just that in a series of classic adaptations, of which this set includes four.  Many other great actresses-- Margaret Rutherford, Helen Hayes and Angela Lansbury among the foremost-- have portrayed Miss Marple. And though their interpretations have been enjoyable, they were not true to the books:  their Jane Marples were sweet, dithery, eccentric .... and not at all like Christie's character.  Joan Hickson, however, is precisely correct:  subtle, reserved, kindly but never effusive or finicky; polite but never grandmotherly; and most of all, Hickson perfectly conveys her penetrating observational skill and her keen and active brain.  She is a formidable intellect cloaked in the guise of a rather prim but never priggish old lady. As a character in Nemesis, part of set #2 (and perhaps the finest of the whole series-- poetical, almost mythical at times, like a fairy tale) says--""Her camouflage is perfect, because she is, partly, just what she seems: a gossipy old village woman. But her logic is ruthless, her powers of synthesis formidable; and above all she never lets go."" ""He called me Nemesis, you know"" Miss Marple says later, ""and he wasn't being entirely humorous.""  This set includes two of my favorites: The 4:50 from Paddington, and Sleeping Murder; and the remaining two are also fine.  The supporting casts are uniformly excellent. And if the DVD quality is not of the finest (a pity, these productions deserve better), if you love Christie, do not hesitate.  I have grown to love watching these productions (and indeed those of the Poirot stories with David Suchet) because, not having lived in those times & places, and Christie not being very big on descriptiveness as to setting, I cannot conjure up images of those times & places adequately-- but the productions do it for me.  At the end we should rejoice that Ms Hickson lived to make these films, just as we should equally jubilate that Jeremy Brett was spared to complete most of the Holmes canon.

Very enjoyable civilised viewing for all anglophiles. One issue, A Caribbean Mystery is set in Barbados, where I live, and yes it still does look exactly as it does in the film, although set 4 decades ago. All the black actors except one are British(the priest at a funeral is Wendell Smith, a local actor with a terribly fake accent!)I've never heard or seen the ritual performed at the gravesite in Barbados, and Christie certainly never mentions it in her book.

One can't even read the text of labels into which the camera pans.
The fault for this travesty lies purely with the transcription - I own VHS tapes recorded in Europe from the telly which have comparatively superb resolution (but which, alas, can only be played on an European TV).
Buy these DVDs only if you are incurably devoted to Joan Dickson's superbly understated performances of Miss Marple's adventures, and are able to pretend you are myopic - or that you have removed your glasses if you already are.

Sleeping Murder - intact: no cuts.
The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side - appears to be intact.
4.50 from Paddington - edited: 5 mins 11 secs
Scenes edited are:
  * Miss Marple and Mrs McGillicuddy directly after the latter arrives at Miss Marple's where she talks about how the people on the railway wouldn't believe a word she said about what she saw on the train(30 secs)
  * Miss Marple collects the mail after it has been dropped off by the postman (13 secs)
  * A continuation of the conversation between Lucy Eylesbarrow and Emma Crackenthorpe as they walk down the hall after the former arrives there where they discuss the imminent arrival of the rest of the family and the peculiarities of the family will / Emma introduces Lucy to Mrs Kidder (the cook) / Dr Quimper leaving and chatting to Emma / Mrs Kidder leaving for the day and Lucy asking if she minds if she does a bit of tidying up / Lucy cleaning the kitchen (3 mins 10 sec)
  * Dr Qumper walking with Inspector Slack away from the barn watched by the two boys / Slack talking to Quimper about the family (1 min 26 secs)
As you can see substantial edits here that actually affect what information we receive about the will, plus the removal of chunks of character development - grrr.

This was viewing using a brand X DVD player, s-video connection and a Triton screen so the absolute quality may vary from that seen by other reveiwers but the comparison is still valid.
As for any cuts remaining, it may have been nice to have the one mentioned in a previous review reinstated, but one of the good things about A&E videos and DVDs is that you get a much more complete version than you would in subsequent reshowings on television when the number of cuts tends to increase to fit in more advertising (so much so that in one British programme- not a Miss Marple one- of which I saw the first episode in England and then watched the complete 2-episode programme in North America, the name of one actress appeared in the opening credits but her performance had been completely cut from the programme.)
It would be sad if anyone was put off seeing the excellent content of this set because of reservations of DVD production and more sad still if A&E were put off bringing out the second series because of it.",1002931200,13,1429,4.560311284046692

This volume of the Miss Marple stories (hopefully there will be more) contains several of my favorite stories including ""The 4:50 from Paddington"" which was first published as ""What Miss McGillicutty Saw."" Margaret Rutherford starred in a version of the story back in the 1940s. Johanna David (the first ""Rebecca"" and mother of the second ""Rebecca"") plays in ""4:50"" -- which involves a mysterious death on a train. Was the victim strangled as Miss McGillicutty says or wasn't she. Miss Marple insists the murder happened, and when the local police fail to fully investigate the crime, she takes matters into her own hands. ""In a few weeks Inspector, one of us will admit that he was wrong"" she tells her nemesis a police officer who turns up in several of the stories.
And speaking of ""Nemesis"", Christie's story of this title is included in this volume though it is called ""Caribbean Mystery."" I read ""Nemesis"" when was first published and at that time I had no idea drugs could be such a problem. In ""Caribbean Mystery"" Miss Marple has been bundled off to Jamaica because her nephew felt she needed a break from the English weather. She finds the island boring until folks start dropping dead.
The DVD also includes ""The Sleeping Muder"" and ""The Mirror Cracked from Side to Side."" The latter has been remade several times, once with Elizabeth Taylor, but I think this one is the best. Claire Bloom plays the aging actress who is attempting a comeback after a bout with drugs and alcohol. BBC/PBS fans will recognize the first murder victim as one of the ""flower"" sisters on ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and the secretary is played by Elizabeth Garvey who appeared as Elizabeth Bennet in the 1980s version of ""Pride and Prejudice.""

""Sleeping Murder""
""Very dangerous to believe people, I haven't for years""

This film is an excellent adaptation of Agatha Christie's book. The actors were well chosen. Graldine Alexander and John Moulder-Brown is a convincing newly wed couple. The couple gets to solve the lion's share of the mystery with guidance from Miss Marple of who warned them not to pursue the mystery. The location is beautiful and requires a vision of the sea. As with most Marple mysteries everyone and no one did it. In fact we are not sure that there was an ""it"" to did?
So get out your teacakes and sit back watching that new fangled invention that the Americans like (the TV) and be swept away to the Sleeping Murder.

""A Caribbean Mystery""
Introducing Jason Rafiel

A relative of Aunt Jane's pays her way for a rest in the West Indies. There she is still sort of out of place with the exception of talkative Major Palgrave who turns up dead. Aunt Jane is teaming up with and usually out guessing another guest (the exocentric millionaire) Mr. Rafael. In the process a few more murders show up and everyone looks suspicious.

This story introduces you to Jason Rafiel who will turn up again in ""Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, V. 7: Nemesis (1986).
It was an intriguing touch to have the dead person's spirit supposed to come back after nine days to get revenge.
You will want to view this movie several times to see how the plot could have gone. Later this movie will be like a friend and just need watching again.

""The Mirror Cracked from Side to Side""
Mirror Cracked from Side to Side

Aunt Jane finds herself at a local an annual summer garden party hosted by the new owners of Gossington Hall. The new owner is an aging movie star who is at odds with the studio producing the latest movie. A visitor mysteriously dies. People start dropping like flies and the Movie Star (Marina) knows she is next. The title of the movie is taken from ""The Lady of Shallot""

Joan Hickson is Miss Marple. Agatha Christie always considered her as the ideal Miss Marple; she shows this through her reserve savvy. Jane takes an interactive interest in the mystery and yet each character as part of the discovery, stands on their own. The ending of the story is as is in life, it is appropriate not black and white judgmental.

""4.50 From Paddington""
4.50 From Paddington

A woman is being strangled and there is a witness. The police are can not find any evidence. So it is up to Miss Marple with help from Lucy Eyelesbarrow an independent maid.

Notice how Aunt Jane is always several steps ahead of the others in planning. Watch the expressions when Aunt Jane grates on David Horovitch as Detective Inspector Slack. ""...When one of us is clever enough to find the body.""

The story does not totally follow the book yet it has the unmistakable Aunt Jane feel.

John Hallam has fun playing randy Cedric Crackenthorpe watch him again playing ""Lord Rhysart"" in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" (1997).

The Moving Finger:
Mrs. Cleat has a nose for the nasty.

Naturally, if they kept the subplots and characterization the same as the book, this movie would be a mini series. However they did do a good job of consolidating characters and sticking to the main points of the story. Even if you have read the book you will enjoy watching the movie.

One of the plusses of this movie is the character that plays Edward Symmington (Michael Culver.) He is in several other English films and plays Prior Robert in the Brother Cadfael Series.

One of the minuses of this movie is the Lisa Doolittle scene; it is totally out of character for aunt Jane films.

You have the characteristic mystery and the usual (or unusual) suspects. Aunt Jane is confronted with a problem that may snowball into murder if she does not figure it out in time. But as everyone says, ""Ask Miss Marple. She usually has the right answer.""

Nemesis:
Jason Rafiel's last wish

Millionaire Jason Rafiel of whom we met in the in the movie ""A Caribbean Mystery (1989) leaves a last wish before he dies. He wants Miss Marple to look into the accusation that his son murdered a girl. He leaves her a considerable sum and a bus ticket regardless of what she finds.

Naturally we get all the clues but only Aunt Jane can make sense out of them.

Murder at the Vicarage:
Aunt Jane sees it all
""Murder at the Vicarage"" starts out with important information scenes and a missing one pound note. As Reverend Leonard Clement (Paul Eddington) passes the hedge hiding Miss Jane Marple (Joan Hickson), he expresses an ill chosen explicative to describe Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Robert Lang).

Yep, there is a murder at the vicarage, which is conveniently located in plane sight of Miss Marple. Everyone has a motive and nobody had opportunity. You and Detective Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) must sort through all the sub plots and confessions to find out what happened.

At Bertram's Hotel:
Muffins vs. tea cakes with raisins
It is not easy comparing movies to books, especially Agatha Christie's novels. However this one has the feel and just the right actors. There is great attention to detail.

If you have the nagging feeling that you saw Chief Inspector Fred Davy (George Baker) before it may be that he has been in at least 100 movies and shows, recently as Detective Chief Inspector Wexford in Ruth Rendell Mysteries.

Bertram's Hotel is just how Jane remembered it as a child. She soon comes to the conclusion that it is to good to be true. The Chief Inspector is of the same mind. This film has several overlying plots. However just being in the hotel will distract you from them.
So get out your muffins, sit up in bed and watch ""At Bertram's Hotel.""

They Do It with Mirrors:

The answer to the riddle is in the title.

Once again Aunt Jane has to sort things out when a friend Ruth asks her to look in on her sister, Carrie Louise. You anticipate that Carrie has had it. And you meet many unbalanced and seedy characters. While you are watching you can miss the whole thing as they do it with mirrors.

Just side notes that the still pictures from this movie are on the back of the video sheath of ""Murder at the Vicarage""

Well paced and the perfect English actors to match each part.",1505692800,38,6532,4.59552495697074
