8001283,1,B0000DJYQ2,"Jeers to Amazon for having this in the SURFING section!  I like the Beach Boys (especially their most overlooked period of 1967-1970), but this is not surfing.",1138492800,5,159,4.888888888888889
8001284,1,B0000DJYQ2,"Contrary to an ealier reviewer's claim that an ""entire concert"" is included at the end, only six songs are shown in the epilogue--two from television appearances and four from the ""Lost Concert"" DVD, so nothing new or special here. The main part of ""Surfin' USA"" is footage from bad beach movies and other non-essential cultural tidbits that have little to do with the real history of surfing, and in fact the soundtrack includes very little Beach Boys music. I think somebody is just trying to make some money off of some archival video that was never purposeful in the first place. This piece of video schlock offers nothing for true fans of either surfing or the music of the Beach Boys.",1081209600,18,690,4.710743801652892
8001285,1,B0000DJYQ2,I love the beach boys and lived through the sixties. This CD does credit to neither. To much talkin not enough rockin. The sound left a lot to be desired. All-in-all save your money. The Beach Boys are American icons; they deserve better.,1080950400,16,238,4.558139534883721
8001286,5,B0000DJYQ2,I really enjoyed this show.  It contains great Footage and Music.  I was totally blown away.  Great  show...Fun and Entertaining.,1074729600,,129,5.3
8001287,5,B0000DJYQ2,"I have never seen this concert by the Beach Boys and I am a big fan.  It starts out as a documentary on surfing, going into the whole history of the wave-riders, and it's got some great 1960's surf footage.  It's really cool!  And the Beach Boys are the soundtrack- how perfect is that?  But the end of the DVD is where it's at... an entire lost concert by the beach Boys from the early 1960's.  This is a great show.  I should know, I'm Fortunato Plethora.",1070582400,8,457,4.195402298850575
