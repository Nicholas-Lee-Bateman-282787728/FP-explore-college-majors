6993924,5,B00SWFM7W4,I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES A LOT. I SPECIFICALLY ENJOY WAR MOVIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.,1428451200,,88,4.5625
6993925,5,B00SWFM7W4,"Fact:  On August 6 and 9, 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombseach with the force of 10 million tons of dynamiteon the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing at least 130,000 civilians but also abruptly ending the war and its daily body count. It was a morally questionable decision then, when the U.S. was racing a team of German scientists to become the first nation to develop a nuclear weapon that would guarantee victory, and it remains so many years later.

Fact: Under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves and physicist J. Robert Oppenhemer, the Manhattan Project had components scattered across the U.S., but its main facility was located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in a remote part of New Mexico, where top minds were recruited to work on the design and construction of the bombs.

Fact:  Because it was top secret, Los Alamos was never referred to by name, only as Site Y or the Hill. Recruits and their families went there with only a post office box to guide them and found a primitive, heavily restricted community of Quonset huts and wood frame buildings. The birth certificates of children born there list only P.O. Box 1663 as their place of birth.

Fiction:  Manh(a)ttan, an original WGN period drama, has a Mad Men vibe to it, not only because it drops you so believably into a different era, but also because of its similar use of music and camera angles, its emphasis on old guard vs. new, and a cast of characters that all seem to face moral dilemmas. It also has a West Wing feel because of the high stakes, crisp dialogue, and scenic constructions that somehow manage to squeeze tension out of seemingly normal conversations. Director Thomas Schlamme is a veteran of The West Wing, and Manhattan is just as strong of a series.

We don't know if its fact or fiction that the Army created a competition at Los Alamos between a better funded A team of scientists under the direction of Dr. Reed Akley (David Harbour) and a B team run by the maverick Dr. Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey). But we don't care, because the situation itself is rooted in history and its believable, given the urgency of the situation and the U.S. Governments practice of making sure that no one knows more than what their compartmentalized section is working on. Loose lips sink ships. And atomic bomb projects.

Manhattan is a taut drama because so much is in play, often at the same time. The Americans are racing the Germans and an imaginary clock, the A team of scientists is competing with the B team and their alternate vision of what will make an A-bomb work, newcomers like wiz kid Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman) are competing with jealous colleagues, the scientists are sometimes at odds with the military establishment responsible for maintaining security and secrecy, the scientists find themselves facing new tension and resentments from the suddenly bored and captive women they brought with them to the base, those who feel the project should forge ahead at all costs are at odds with those who want to exercise some caution because of the contaminants they're working with, and when its clear that a spy is among them more tension ensues when a government official (West Wing veteran Richard Schiff) conducts his own version of a McCarthy witch hunt.

There are individual tensions as well. Winters wife, Liza (Olivia Williams), a Ph. D. in botany who finds life on the hill frustrating because Army censors keep taking out the heart of any scholarly paper she tries to mail to a journal. But even she doesnt immediately notice another source of drama:  the fact that some of her chrysanthemums that should be white are purple instead, or the fact that her beehive is struggling. Another character is struggling financially and tries to benefit from his own research.

All of the characters and the actors who play them are fascinating, three-dimensional beings that we instantly care about. Its a great ensemble, with the standouts being Williams as Liza Winter, Hickey as Frank Winter, Daniel Stern (City Slickers) as the goat-bearded mentor Glen Babbit, and Abby Isaacs (Rachel Brosnahan), Charlies bored wife who finds herself suddenly drawn into a lesbian relationship with the intriguing French woman (Carole Weyers) who lives across from them.

Given all the tension that Manhattan has going for it naturally, my family and I found the sex subplots to be a little gratuitous and unnecessary, but thats really the only complaint about a series that had us wishing we could pop in Season 2 right away.  But Manhattan is every bit a TV-14 series. Sex is often suggested or depicted, with key body parts covered, while once a womans bare derriere is shown in half-darkness. Although there isn't much violence, whats here can be disturbing:  a suicide, a murder, and beatings. Compared to those, language that consists mostly of damns and hells aren't terribly memorable.

But for teens and their parents who like a good continuing drama that arcs over 13 episodes, Manhattan is a riveting series. You like these people, you love the period brought to life, and you learn what it must have been like to live in the middle of history literally in the making. Production values are excellent as well, with the Blu-ray featuring plenty of detail, rich period-looking colors, and a vibrant soundtrack that has plenty of depth and resonance.

Language:  Lots of damns and hells, a few scattered others
Sex:  All consensual, mostly suggested with some (but not key) body parts showing except for one female rear-end in half-darkness
Violence:  A murder, a suicide, some beatings
Adult situations:  Same-sex seduction, intense interrogations
Takeaway:  WGN isn't just the home of Chicago sports; this miniseries is as good as anything HBO or the other networks have done

6993926,5,B00SWFM7W4,"As a period drama, this show is fantastic. Yes, it plays somewhat fast and loose with the facts of the Manhattan Project--most of the characters are fictional, for example. But it seems to capture the feel of what it was like to be there, working on the ""gadget,"" and most importantly, it's a ton of fun to watch.",1428019200,19,313,4.413793103448276
6993927,4,B00SWFM7W4,"I enjoyed the series. Although it is admittedly  not quite historically accurate, it was plausible throughout. I think it captured many aspects of the lives that those scientists and their families led. I did not personally experience any of it myself, but I have read other accounts. I would hope that the lives of those involved were not so dreary and fatalistic as portrayed - but perhaps that's the way it was. They were all amazing people. They are unknown, compared to battle heroes like those in Europe and the Pacific, but they deserve our appreciation almost as much.",1494720000,,576,4.818181818181818

6993937,5,B00SWFM7W4,"My wife and I stumbled onto Manhattan totally by accident.  Looking for a series which would hold both of our interests to watch an episode or so daily, Manhattan fills the void.  Set in Los Alamos, NM during WWII, Manhattan uses fictional and real characters to tell the story of the first successful nuclear bomb.

Spies, secrets, affairs, suicide.  All these come to play in the storyline.  The acting is top notch, the writing fantastic and the set/costumes definitely period.  This is an overview for entertainment and not a documentary.  However, enough facts are presented that the viewer has no problem understanding the difficulties that must have faced the scientists and engineers of the time.",1486684800,,704,5.069565217391304

6993942,5,B00SWFM7W4,"My wife and I watched both seasons of 'Manhattan' on Hulu. We are both in agreement that this short lived series is among the finest to have ever aired on TV. The writing and acting in this show, is about as good as it gets.

Since I have a great interest in, and have read a lot of books on the Manhattan Project, I was thrilled to discover that this series had been made. The show is absolutely riveting, and is so interesting, that each episode seems to go by in an instant.

With so many mediocre shows on TV, it's sad when a series of this caliber gets cancelled, due to low ratings. With that said, I'm happy that I was at least able to watch with thorough delight, the 23 episodes that were produced.

If you like period pieces, and have any interest in the lives of those who participated in the Manhattan Project, you'll no doubt agree that this is among the finest shows of this type ever made. The lives of the scientists, their families, and the secrets they had to keep, make for an epic storyline.

Living in the middle of the New Mexico desert, working on the most highly classified project in the world, certainly took its toll on all those involved. The manner in which the lives of all are intertwined, and the incredible acting performances by all, make you feel as if you're part of the actual scene.

This is a TV series not to be missed. In addition to the outstanding writing and acting, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. In addition, the automobiles of the 1930's and 1940's are interesting in their own right. I cannot recommend a TV series any higher than this. It just doesn't get any better.

The bottom line is that 'Manhattan', will leave you wanting for more. After you finish watching this series, it will take a while to find something else worth your time. This is one of those shows, like 'Breaking Bad,' where everything you watch afterwards is a letdown. That's how great it is.",1480291200,,1924,4.467236467236467

Watch great man such as Niels Bohr, Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein come to life next to fiction characters in a great historic journey where you feel the tension rising.

6993955,4,B00SWFM7W4,Very interesting show and the debut of how the atomic bomb was thought of and created. Really liked the aspects of the show when it came to the discovery of how things were thought of and created. Only downfall was maybe the personal lifes on occasion.,1461542400,,252,4.5
6993956,4,B00SWFM7W4,"Some very interesting ideas about the Manhattan Project, but a lot of conjecture. The acting and cast selection was will done. If you're not a good historian or you knowledge of events surrounding this issue are incomplete, then it's very possible you could get misled into believing this drama is historically accurate. Truth is, there is quite a bit of fiction to this account of one of the biggest events of the twentieth century.",1458604800,,433,4.864864864864865
6993957,1,B00SWFM7W4,"A lot of effort went into the visual design of this show.  The right cars, the right clothes, the right hair styles.  It's  pity the same level of care was not applied by the writers.  Period drama should not be about modern people, with modern attitudes and mores, living modern problems, all while wearing ""retro"" clothes.  However, that is what Manhattan portrays.  There is no discernible plot, the characters are crude stereotypes, there are multiple anachronisms and glaring factual errors.  The ""drama"" cannot hold your attention and so simulated sex is used to titillate the viewer into continued watching.

There is no character development in the series.  There are just a selection of tired, stereotypes populating the New Mexico desert.  WACS are portrayed as either sluts or prostitutes.  They are the punchline of every bad joke about women in the military brought to life.  Jews are portrayed as lazy and scheming.  A leading Jewish scientist articulates that the reason he and other Jews have not completed their calculations is that now they are not subject to the anti-Jewish employment laws, they weren't going to work hard.  The manager of Oak Ridge, Tn, is portrayed as an ignorant Southern goober.  He is described as a ""hay seed"".  Of course if you're the US government hiring a manager for a state of the art technical facility, you're going to choose a completely inexperienced, ignoramus.  Middle class women are sexually frustrated, promiscuous when given the opportunity, but they hide it well.  Working class women are just promiscuous, they don't bother to hide it. Middle class men are promiscuous and sexually exploit women of all classes.  Enlisted military are ignorant and brutal.  Commissioned military are ignorant and deceptive.

Even cursory research by the writers about the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos or even engineering in general would have been appropriate.  The notion that there was widespread radiological contamination of the workers and the site is completely unfounded.  In 1943 there was very little fissile material and it wasn't being carelessly handled.  Another anachronism is the modern attitudes of some of the characters.  In one scene, a character becomes upset about the use of DDT on the base.  In 1943, DDT was considered a gift of modern chemistry that prevented saved millions from insect borne illness.  Questions about the safety of the chemical did not arise until the late 1950s, 17 years after the drama is set.  A quick google search would have cleared up that fact.

Ultimately, this series could have been very interesting but the laziness of the writers is too much to overcome.  I gave it one star for the efforts of the visual designers.",1458259200,8,2715,5.076923076923077
6993958,5,B00SWFM7W4,"This is FANTASTIC. Please ignore the idiot, negative reviews who nit-pick this because of the ""Hollywood Drama Trappings."" Yes there are anachronisms. Yes there was no Interpol in 1943. Yes the writer's took off on an HBO high by making many of the female soldiers prostitutes and had to write in the lesbian affair. It's still an excellent script and excellent acting! Premo acting I should say! The best thing about this series is it makes me pause the episode all the time while I run to Google to find as much as I can on ""Nuclear Science for Dummies!"" Serious!

6993960,5,B00SWFM7W4,"I binge-watched all 13 episodes of this series on a recent (Qantas) flight from Dallas to Sydney and was so fascinated that I was afraid the flight would end before I finished watching episode 13 (which was, of course, a cliff-hanger).  I arrived in Sydney bleary-eyed and a bit frazzled by the dark nature of the plot lines but also considerably more informed than I had previously been about the development of atomic weapons at Los Alamos.  Wanting to share my fascination with ""Manhattan"", I ordered Season 1 from Amazon and re-watched it with my husband, who was similarly hooked.

Most of the characters are fictional, but there are cameo appearances by some of the prominent nuclear scientists who laboured (under considerable pressure) to produce the weapons that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (and whose successors are contained in nuclear arsenals around the world today).  For those of us who are fascinated by WWII, by the interaction among the military, the intelligence community and a bunch of fairly nave, if brilliant, academics, and by the terrain of New Mexico [admittedly, this is a niche market].... this series is one of the best in recent memory.

Not living in the US, I have not been able to view Season 2 on TV (I would expect that it would interest only a very small market in Australia).  I am waiting for Amazon to release it on video, and I will order immediately.  I must find out what has happened to Frank, how Charlie will fare in his new role, whether Meeks will be discovered, whether Charlie's wife Abby will return to Boston .... and, of course, what project will be made on production of ""the gadget"".",1453248000,2,1649,4.764912280701754

Where are the sideline stories of Hitler's 68 handwritten copies of his diary on soft baby jew-skin books?

6993968,5,B00SWFM7W4,"A year of my childhood was spent (well) in Los Alamos 1956/7 and I did become an engineer with a minor in physics and an interest in the whole saga of nuclear weaponry. This series is not a factual rendering of the 1943-45 effort, nor do the producers intend it to be. However, the translation of this series is brilliant: consider minor shifts in the context of the true Manhattan Project, like IF Leslie Groves HAD still taken Oppenheimer as the project head BUT didn't tolerate sharing of information except on a need to know, AND IF he had backed the rabid anti-communist 'security' people only slightly more.... PLUS if the university physicists had taken their institutional competitions (both as individuals and in the collective) to Los Alamos... turning their university physics dept bureaucracy gamesmanships into nuclear weaponry gamesmanship. Well, then the ""Manhattan"" presentation of reality would have been completely accurate. It's like the opening to the TV series Twilight Zone: ""Submitted for your approval.""

This translation has at least two main factors which sanction - in my mind - the distortions of the drama: First, it tracks what might have happened given a slightly different matrix if elements and relationships... and the outcome would have been no weapon at all but a LOT internal strife and bloodshed. Second, for a generation of young adults who have never really had to consider either the history of the Project or the ramifications of the existence of the nuclear threat during their lives, it offers something that they do understand within just about ANY company or organization in this era: the unremitting subversion of collective efforts by the individual use and invocation of tactics that are simply destructive in all senses to the goals of individuals and the whole, so they can understand what a hose up the real Manhattan Project could have become. The best reason for the distortions of dramatic license is that - even for me - no one simply watching a dramatic presentation, no matter how accurate or involving, can possibly comprehend what it was like within the Project with the whole world threatened by murderous maniacs, who IF they utilized their own country's physics and industrial base could have easily produced a nuclear weapon of some kind and essentially dictated a draconian 'peace' of dismal effect and endless duration. We on the outside of this effort cannot understand the stresses on the individuals of this threat combined with the struggle to make their own efforts bear fruit first. ""Manhattan"" succeeds very well in presenting the stress as well as the sense that with just a little more interference in the original Project... nothing would have happened other than a lot of security people advancing within their bureaucracy for disrupting the necessary collaborative process that eventually did succeed in 1945.

The guilt, the suspicion, the race against time, the fear of radiation exposure, the closely kept secrets, and how it all hangs by a thread that could snap at any moment. Seriously, it's well done. Netflix probably won't get the rights to it anyway, and your local library doesn't have the budget for DVD series purchases anymore so you might as well just buy it here. There are 2 relationships on the show that I find lacking in substance and credibility, both of them marital affairs, but since those are so minor to the story and only cover a few scenes, I let it go. They did cost my rating a star though.",1440460800,,696,4.488188976377953

6993994,4,B00SWFM7W4,Excellent adult drama of the Manhattan Project where the atom bomb was developed. This series spends a good deal of the season developing numerous story lines. The impact of working on this project professionally and personally is profound. One of the best TV dramas I have ever watched. This is not a family friendly show - which is incongruous with WGN's typical programing. There is considerable attention to historical detail with a couple of exceptions referring to things that did exist until the 1950s. Lots of plot changes in the final three episodes. No spoilers here. The extras are good.,1434240000,7,598,4.99
6993995,4,B00SWFM7W4,"This was a friend's recommendation and although it didn't instantly appeal, I gave it a go. It turned out to be a hidden gem! The development of the atom bomb, codenamed The Manhatten Project, merely underlay for the internecine struggles of two opposing chalkboard theorists and their minions. There's also conflict aplenty in the home life as the isolated encampment simmers in the desert heat; betrayal, tragedy and latent sexual desires all come to the boil. You could label 'Manhatten' as basically a soap opera albeit a very glossy one but that would be disingenuous as, typical of the high standard of production value and accomplished acting, this a cut above.
There are too many great performances from a very large ensemble to start listing but..... Rachel Brosnahan, Harry Lloyd, Carole Weyers are fab plus it was fun to see Peter Stormare cameoing as the eccentric Russian explosives guru (what else!) and Richard Schiff (Toby Zeigler of West Wing) being uber creepy as the CIA spook.

I hope the Second Season includes people I met, like Feynman and Teller.  The sets are great and the acting perfect.  Who came up with the blackboard math poetry?  The actual equations are all online and unclassified.  You can DIY... your own nuclear weapon.  Welcome to a world still on the brink.

6994005,5,B00SWFM7W4,"A powerful series, with characters that grab you and keep your interest. It is a wonder that America was able to create the first A-Bomb at all, with the constant politics, security precautions, and meddling of the military, who barely understood any of the work going on there. The characters are outstanding composites of actual people who were there, and the actors are superior and absolutely perfect for the storyline. You get the feel of what life was like for them, in this place where the lines between citizen and prisoner are blurred. As you watch each episode, you worry, that at any moment, anyone among them could be mistaken for a spy, or could actually be a spy, and shot on the spot. Through it all, these top scientists, from around the world, working at a place in the desert (Los Alamos) that did not exist on any map, having to constantly keep their eyes on the prize, and put the needs of their families and friends behind the military's need to get the bomb before the Nazis.

6994006,5,B00SWFM7W4,"i'm something of a devotee of historical dramas, and few do it better than the British, who mine their deep history with objectivity, humor, wit, self-criticism and insight. yet despite the vast and often complicated influence and contributions of the U.S. to the world, U.S. television seems generally uninterested in contemplating U.S. history with anything but the most sycophantic gaze, choosing to infantilize the audience with steaming, buttery heaps of stoopid and pretend. so, here's to promising first steps! let's hope that the writers of Manhattan are encouraged to continue to present an aspect of American history and achievement that still raises profound issues and debate. maybe even set off a trend for serious, smart and entertaining interpretations of our actions and reactions in the world that we struggle to shape and are ultimately shaped by.",1428710400,8,865,5.367647058823529

8699586,5,B00SWFM7W4,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. They play fine.

The Manhattan series is terrific. I love period shows that take a little history and make it dramatic fiction, in other words, they breathe life into the subject, make it interesting. If you like Manhattan (2014-2015) you might like Granite Flats (2013-2015) or Taken (2002). All three series are set during WWII or shortly after. They are about secret government programs. Manhattan is about making the first atomic bomb, like the movie Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Taken is about UFOs and alien visitors, sort of a fictionalized version of Project Blue Book. And Granite Flats is about the experimental drug program MKUltra (the CIA mind control program).

All three series have great story arcs. They start and finish strong and have great middles. One difference is the smoking and drinking. There is smoking and drinking in almost every scene in Manhattan, which was set during the era when soldiers received packs of cigarettes with their meal rations. Ever been around a chain smoker? In Taken theres a scene where Crawford says his doctor prescribed cigarettes for hypertension. Imagine that. I don't remember any smoking in Granite Flats, but that might just be my poor memory.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2925,5.212765957446808
