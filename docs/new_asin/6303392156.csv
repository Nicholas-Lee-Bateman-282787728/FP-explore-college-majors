7844823,5,6303392156,"This is an old time favorite TV series that I wish they had made a longer run of. Kind of campy and far fetched it still captured my imagination during a time when it was sorely needed. I kept an eye on the VHS versions on Amazon in my wish list before seeing that it had been released on a DVD. The DVD itself is underwhelming as it looks just like a ghost image copy of the VHS to DVD format. But still, it brought back good memories.",1424995200,,436,3.965909090909091
7844824,5,6303392156,"The US entertainment media has a lovely protectionist endowment from us, preventing foreign DVD sellers across our shores by such tricks as regional disc coding. Only Asian suppliers seem to be able to get us ""region free"" discs. The DVD of this series, available in every other English-speaking country, is not sold here. This is so sad, given the quality of this brief, six-episode series from 1993. The cast creates engaging characters and an excellent ensemble composed of Marjorie Monagham, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Danny Quinn, Jack McGee, and starring Linda Hunt and Jeff Kaake. The special effects stand up to 21st century standards, and the story-line can hook you if you don't watch out. The series is only available in the US by resale of these original VHS tapes, two episodes each (total three tapes).

Tape two, episodes Replacements, and Trial, introduce us to one of the more evil characters in the Space Rangers world, and, the extent to which evil can manipulate and direct social authority such as police and courts. We begin to learn much more about the strange and secretive good-guy alien race of Graakans, of which our Space Ranger Zylyn, played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, is one of their warrior priests. Zylyn also eats raw Banshie (depriving his superiors of the first biological sample of this indefatigable locust-like terror-race). Replacements takes us a bit into the bionic medicine of the this sci-fi world, continually introduced to us by the intriguingly created android character, Ringer, played by Keith Berger, for this episode.

I love these episodes and, like Firefly and Wonderfalls, must forever pine for further seasons that will never occur.",1260230400,3,1679,5.169117647058823

The prime reason I watched this series.
It was a fun, all-too-short-run series (summer replacement, I think) that grabbed your attention, if you happened onto it.
'Gritty' and humorous in the vein of Bladerunner.
People always want to compare shows like this to Firefly... I never 'got into' that series. I feel Space Rangers will stand on its own for sci-fi affectionados just for the fun of it.
Definitely worth checking out.
I only wish there was a reasonably priced region 1 DVD release.
Enjoy!

7844826,3,6303392156,"I am a Jeff Kaake fan! Even though the plot isn't the best (which is probably why this show only lasted six episodes) if you are a Jeff Kaake fan, you still have to see this. Even though he isn't clean shaven and roughed up a bit, he is still good looking and a great actor.

The characters are quirky, always getting by--barely--by the seats of their pants, honorable, and the good guys (and gals) always win. This is not a heavy show and there are always several laughs along the way.",1218931200,,486,4.282608695652174
