3503246,5,B001BZA2VU,"I would strongly disagree with the one negative review here and say that this is an extremely professional video. I will say it is not in any way a slick talking head movie.  In fact, its style, a well integrated mosaic of information keeps it from ever being 'slick.'  But anyone will quickly understand that this was put together by someone with an expertise in  teaching. And I wholeheartedly agree to  some others here have said about lowering the learning curve.

For example, this, video actually covers XLR input: from the settings for it to the use and limitations of the phantom power supply.  Phantom power isn't even discussed in the  other how-to videos I've seen on this camera.  Also covered only here, is why you would use a drop or non-drop frame rate.  This video, if you haven't guess already, goes out of its way to cover features filmmakers might have need for, for example, there is  a demonstration of how the attenuators can be used to reduce too-loud noises like gunshots.  And I once had an explosion damage a lens.  So the admonition to run out and buy a UV filter isn't just idle filler, it's good common sense for every camera.

I also appreciate that almost everything is demonstrated, instead of just touched on.  We never have to watch the narrator talk, everything onscreen is something useful.  In fact, you might want to have your pause button ready because there are tons of text notes that expand and add to what is said in the voice-over.  I even saved myself some wasted effort, as I was planning on trying out night mode for night-time shoot, simply because night mode and its limitations are covered here.

I have never used gels and thus found the demonstration of how to use the Kelvin white balance settings and gels for indoor/outdoor shots enlightening.  Not only was it a good demonstration, but at that point it was clear to me the narrator had a real investment in understanding this camera and that he was sharing knowledge he cared about.

All in all, this video is well worth the price and I for one, was not disappointed.",1218326400,10,2073,4.63013698630137
3503247,5,B001BZA2VU,"I've been viewing this video for a few days now.  And each time I retain a little bit more about my XHA1.

The programmed instruction really seems to be working for me and the multiple chapters let me skip what I don't need to go over.

I recommend this excellent video to anyone needing to learn how to use this camcorder and camera.",1217289600,4,334,4.26984126984127
3503248,4,B001BZA2VU,"I just love this video.  After spending what I did for the camera itself, it seemed daunting, but important to learn all I needed to know to get the most out of it.  This video has so much detail that I know I'm going to have to watchit more than once , to remember it all.
The follow along instructions are very helpful, and I for one, appreciate the tips oneverything from the protective lens (which I got right away) to the underwater housing.",1217203200,3,446,4.2976190476190474
3503249,5,B001BZA2VU,"I teach at a film school and I have also made a few features ... and let me tell you something .. this Video has the moxie to not only get you to the starting gate, but out of it, and down the track ahead of the field. I have been screaming for a creative, well constructed video to inspire new motion picture creators on the techniques and the mechanics of digital movie making for years.

Yeah, this video is about a camera ... but it's about much more ... it's about shooting a movie ... and by-the-way, the more experienced 'shooter' will find this video overflowing with good advice and rock solid information for making the shift to digital or just improving upon their digital motion picture skills.

Okay, what I like most about this video is that it significantly lowers the steep learning curve on this seemingly complex piece of equipment.

Yes, after watching it, and going along with it, a few times, you will feel more confident with your camera - but also motion picture creation in general.

I recommend it - buy it, watch it, learn",1216512000,13,1048,4.5
3503250,1,B001BZA2VU,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-Learn-the-Canon-XH-A1-XH-A1-XHA1-TUTORIAL-TEACHING-PROGRAMMED-INSTRUCTION-DVD/dp/B001BZA2VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 Learn the (Canon XH A1, XH-A1) XHA1 TUTORIAL TEACHING PROGRAMMED-INSTRUCTION DVD</a>

Ok first off, the DVD was delivered as promised. I own the XH-A1 prosumer camcorder. I am reviewing this instructional video and comparing it to the DVD I already own by Douglas Spotted Eagle. I short video will be posted on You tube, along with some screen grabs and TV camera shots.

With that being said. The video is approximately 1 hour and 41 minutes. First thing I noticed when I opened the package is that it doesn't appear professional as does the DSE video. This is important as you'll see why.

First though, remember this XH-A1 is not for the average person to use and some experience in digital video and working with prosumer camcorders should be a prerequisite. I've owned the Sony VX2100 for a few years before upgrading to HDV video.

The good thing about this video is that it goes into a bit more detail, but in my opinion too much fluff, such as additional attachments and filters for this camcorder.

The video is truly for the beginner, who has no idea maybe what shutter speed vs aperture is. This video comes in handy. I got very little knowledge from it. However someone just starting out, this camcorder is quite intimidating, so I'd get as much help as I possibly can in hope of learning more.

Starting with the DVD navigation, my opinion is that it is very confusing to navigate, highlighted colors for each scene are poorly contrasted. As you'll see in my video to come, the screen ratio continues to change; example, small box in the center of your screen then to letter box, not very pleasing to watch nor professional.

The audio quality was at best atrocious, with hissing, peaking out of rage (distortion), hissing, sound going from left speaker to the right one at will. From extremely loud audio to very low. This will show the out of range audio from the screen grabs in Vegas Pro, where the audio spikes. That's not how I want to hear audio, its just plain annoying.

The videos jumps and cuts that supposed to transition properly are very bad, at times looks like the jitters. Lighting on several areas of the video are blow out, too bright, not lit properly as far as I can see.

Even though I'm only considered an amateur enthusiast I'd prefer a professional product, and was happy to pay twice the amount for DSE's video. I can't comment on the elite video as I have not purchased that one.

The quality of the DVD itself is a plain white printable disc, with very little reference to the NTSC standards on the container, if any at all. DSE on the other had has a professional DVD and the container tells what it should, running time, Dolby Digital, Region code, etc. Since this is a review of Mr. Curran's video I compared it to DSE's. One great feature tha DSE's DVD has over Mr. Curran's DVD, is that Mr. Curran's DVD is a 4.7 single layer disc, vs DSE's, DVD-9 dual layer, that translates in to less compression and smoother video, at least from what I can see on my TV. A Sony 60"" Rear Projection XBR series. On a smaller tv this might not matter.

So, does this affect the content of the video (can't just a book by its cover), in my opinion yes. I'd rather have a video that is made by a well know videographer, i.e Douglas Spotted Eagle. I have book by him and other products.

All this might not mean a thing to some people and can judge for themselves, as everyone will surly have different opinions on everything.

Conclusion; I'd recommended it for beginner's, but, I keep an open mind and can always learn something most of the time.",1216425600,2,3774,4.796610169491525

8285328,5,B001BZA2VU,"This DVD is a great introduction to the workings of this camera and also a fantastic reference point for anyone who wants to utilise its advanced features for more professional ventures.

In the late nineties Canon revolutionised the world of low budget film-making with the introduction of its ground breaking XL1 video camera which became a favourite among semi-professional and professional camera users alike. Its high versatility and stunning picture quality saw it being employed from weddings to feature films - indeed the Danny Boyle directed film 28 Days Later was one of the first feature films to be shot with this new (at the time) more affordable technology.

In 2007 Canon launched its newest semi-pro camera,the HD quality XH A1, and this machine carried on the fantastic tradition of appealing to amateur and professional movie makers alike by being the main camera used for the Jason Statham movie Crank 2; High Voltage, among others. A newer variant the XH A1S has since been launched which adds several more features to an already packed list.

Whether you're a novice to this camera or a seasoned pro you will find something in this DVD to help you get to grips or experiment with this highly versatile camera. It is actually more a photography class on a disc as it guides you on everything from setting up the camera fresh out of the box, to getting to grips with the various exposure and focus settings. Everything is covered in clear concise detail and in language that is straight forward and easy to understand - with accompanying video demonstrations - and what's more, it actually makes you feel confident and inspired enough to play around and experiment with the settings to get the type of footage which best suits your intended production.

In the more advanced section you will learn about various audio settings, frame rates, color settings, and light balancing, so no matter if it's a nature shoot or an acting scene under studio lighting you will learn the basics of how to get the best out of this camera.

I have shot several documentaries and a movie myself with this camera and even still I found this DVD highly informative and easy to digest and in fact I would say it is a very valuable addition to any kit bag.

Of course no amount of instruction is going to beat getting out there and practising, but this disc is a great way to get started.

Highly recommended for pros and novices alike.",1407283200,,2434,4.767220902612826
8285329,1,B001BZA2VU,Waste of money poorly made video made out of someone's garage. Would give it no stars if they would let me.,1395360000,,107,4.142857142857143
8285330,4,B001BZA2VU,"I got the Canon XH-A1s just recently and was blown away by the amount of control you have over the settings.  You have so much control, in fact, that the camera can be overwhelming once you step off the ""automatic path"".  The other reviews capture most od the key points.  There is almost no feature that goes unaddressed witch is a testament to how well the instructor put time and thought into putting the DVD together.

So forget that the production is a littlle quirky, like the sound of the instructors voice switching from stereo to mono at times, this is a great way to learn the basics of using the myriad of features this camera presents.",1299369600,,647,4.504273504273504
8285331,5,B001BZA2VU,"Im getting into filmmaking as a hobby and this dvd was excellent! I bought a Canon XH A1s. I've had it for a couple months, fooling around with different shots but I have learned more in the first thirty minutes of this video than I have on my own. This is an easy to follow, step by step, perfect dvd for anyone who wants to start filming or even wants a refresher course. This video contains a lot of information about film as well, even if you don't have a video camera it suggests, you will still learn a thing or two about recording a decent shot. But, enough of this. I still have an hour left on the dvd and really want to finish!!!!

Thanks,

8285332,1,B001BZA2VU,"i really wasn't happy with this purchase and i wonder about the validity of other reviews here and that inspires me to write something closer to reality. when i first got it in the mail, i wondered what seller i got it from (amazon carrying different sellers) because i thought i had a boot leg copy of the real thing.  i mean visually it'd be laughed at by 3rd rate Chinese boot leggers.  it looks like a 3rd grader got some printer software, didn't know how to use it really and printed the inserts out.  literally the worst I've ever seen, even comparing to friends printing out inserts.  for FIFTY bucks i was really not happy about the ""here's your damn dvd"" apathy packaging.  for 1/10th that price i'd have overlooked it.  there were a few nice things covered (in too much depth since they were basic issues such as ND filtering), how to put the strap on, etc,  and a few complex things just rushed over and explained poorly (such as programming customizations).  the audio was as unprofessional as the packaging.  you can tell sometimes he'd use one mic that sounded fine, the other it sounded like a mic he bought for 59 cents.  this alternated between the two for the whole video.  the fonts he continually insisted on using (often just typing out what he was speaking) looked so amateur and wasn't even necessary to begin with.  again, it looked like a kid put it together (with windows movie maker).  how he watched this, and then had the nerve to sell it for FIFTY bucks is just mind numbing. given the overall quality, 20 would have been high but i'd be less upset. then he has the nerve to act like ""hey, i'm doing this to help YOU out, because there's nothing really good out there from what i've seen.  Um, there still isn't anything good.  at least the ones he criticized were professionally put together (and cheaper). i think the fact that he's all about the xh-a1's auto features says a lot.  no self respecting video guy relies on auto features.  if you do, just buy an HV40 and be happy.  i also see on his ebay page, he's selling this at BID, hoping to get even more than 50 if he can.  kind of backs my theory of greed.  50 bucks for this poorly planned and executed piece of garbage is totally unfair.  i thought the entrepreneural spirit to create such a tutorial was a great idea.  but to have no pride in your quality of work, mixed with severe overpricing makes this a huge FAIL.  that being said, if 50 bucks is nothing to you, you don't mind poor quality, and you hate manuals/prefer spoon feeding even with a dirty wooden spoon, and you don't expect to resemble an expert after watching this, you could be ok with the purchase.",1272067200,,2660,4.439175257731959
8285333,5,B001BZA2VU,"I ordered this DVD to help learn my new Canon XHA1S. Although the DVD was done for the ""older"" XHA1, I found that it covered nearly everything I needed for the newer model too.

I've attended many seminars over the years & have spent a lot of time in universities, but find that it's more convenient; effective; & cost-efficient to learn from instructional videos at home. Frankly, I'll buy a program like this anytime it's available, well presented, and reasonably priced. There's simply no more convenient, comfortable, & efficient way to learn...

Mr. Curran apparently put a lot of time in his project and took care to be certain it was clearly presented & thorough. After watching & reviewing his material & reading the manual, I believe I am compentent enough to work with the camera.

Another reviewer stated that he could've learned from the manual all that is in the video. I'd simply argue that learning only from reading the manual is not nearly as effective, especially for a newcomer like me. He might also believe that professors aren't necessary in college either since the information is in text books. But, it's certainly nice to  have someone knowledgable to research, organize, & present the information in an effective manner. Mr. Currran has done just that in his presentation and it comes with the ability to re-wind and pause...(try that in a seminar or college class)

As a side note I'd like to thank the author for contacting me personally to ensure the video arrived safely. He apparently cares about his customers too.

Thanks again, Mr. Curran.....Well done.",1262563200,3,1587,4.902985074626866
8285334,3,B001BZA2VU,definetley not worth the money. I could have learned everything in this DVD from the manual. It was well put together but If I could have my $50 back I wouldn't have bought it. If this sold for $10-$20 then I'd say it's worth the money but there isn't really anything in here you can't learn by just reading through the manuel.,1236384000,,327,4.290322580645161
8285335,5,B001BZA2VU,"This dvd blows away all competing Canon professional camcorder training dvd's.  Without doubt, the author actually uses (and likes) this Canon xha1 camera.  Since other Canon professional camcorders share many of the same exact features and buttons, all Canon professional camcorder users (A1, G1, H1) will benefit from this excellent dvd.  The presentation is outstanding - highly legible closeups of actual camera buttons and screens plus inclusion of additional text and illustrations to highlight important procedural information.  No wasted time looking at head shots of the presenter.  All information is concise, explicit and to the point.

The Canon XHA1 ia a powerful camcorder with extensive user controls.  This dvd will show you what these controls are and tell you how to use them.  Highly recommended!",1225065600,7,815,5.464
