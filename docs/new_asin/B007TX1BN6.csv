5109995,5,B007TX1BN6,"I like this set!  Transformers The Japanese Collection!  The set contains 3 anime shows Transformers: Headmasters, Transformers : Super God Master force and Transformers : Victory! If this set sells well enough, I hoping the Shout Factory will be able to get the two OVA Transformers Episodes-Scramble City and Zone. I hope one day they will release Scramble City and Zone in the West!",1492214400,,385,5.0
5109996,5,B007TX1BN6,"This collection is really good.  Just wished it was broadcasted in the United States.  Moreover, have it English dubbed by the original voice actors.  Helps fill the void for me.",1462579200,3,178,4.866666666666666

5110001,5,B007TX1BN6,"The US Transformers G1 series ended with the season 4 episodes of Rebirth. Takara decided to take season 4 of transformers and make a continuation. That became Headmasters. Super-Godforce (or tf powermasters). And victory. All shown on tv chronologically.
  This dvd set covers all three parts of that continuity. Even if it's in Japanese, with the English subtitles. I was able to watch it from where rebirth ended. I admit it was a good series. A long story. But worth watching. It's a great set to own. It tells the story from transformers season 4 and after that. With what would later be season 5 and season 6, if  hasbro went on with producing the transformers series. Takara decided to do that. And this trilogy was released. It brings back memories when I used to watch it when I was growing up.",1422489600,11,803,4.640845070422535
5110002,5,B007TX1BN6,Awesome package for the fans,1417219200,,28,4.8
5110003,3,B007TX1BN6,"I'm a kid from the 80's. I adored this stuff. Even after the American series got canceled I got Transformer toys like Sixshot and the Seacons. My friends had others like the Pretenders and Scorpunock. We never seen these guys in a cartoon before and this collection gave me my chance along with learning more about God Girai etc. Let me just say, the stories are uninspired by anime standards. Watching Mobile Suit Gundam or even Dragonball Z makes the stories here look shallow. Guys just die for no reason and easily. No warning or reason other than to create more toys to sell I guess. Watch for the memories and continued animation of your favorite childhood robots, don't expect much else.",1398556800,8,694,4.69672131147541
5110004,5,B007TX1BN6,"The price and the packaging make this one stand out above the rest.  Granted, there have been complaints about the subtitles vs. English dubs, but dig on Youtube for the Star TV dubs, and you'll understand why they never made it Stateside,  Shout Factory did the best they could, and IMO, went above and beyond in bringing these quintessential series to the U.S., even going as far to provide replacement discs for some that had errors.  A great set worth owning.",1391644800,10,463,4.691358024691358
8521878,4,B007TX1BN6,"Its cool to have additional seasons beyond the American released seasons.  This is not dubbed and is totally subtitled - so if you don't like that don't bother with this.  I don't mind it at all and have grown to prefer the Japanese voices of characters in anime more than the English dubbed voices for the most part.  I am not too into the Headmasters but they're ok - it seems like the characterization of the individuals has become more two dimensional and not as distinctive as the earlier seasons.  In Headmasters they kill off Optimus Prime (again!),  Galvatron gets blown up with Cybertron (presumably), Rodimus Prime goes on a ""journey"" and leaves Cerebros in charge - who is even more bland than Rodimus Prime and Skorpinok takes charge of the Decepticons and is in the shadows until he reveals his giant weapon. I am looking forward to the next two seasons and hope it improves a bit more - its keeping me entertained but just barely.  As opposed to the first season where one new all the Transformers and Decepticons, this season has a bunch of different combining groups, headmasters and what not who I am unfamiliar with and almost seems like they're are too many indistinct characters running about.  I think they might bring Optimus Prime and Galvatron back somehow in the next season or two - but haven't got there yet.  I did like seeing some of the Transformers that I had as toys but never appeared in the American released seasons - and I found it interesting that they destroyed Soundwave and had him remade as Soundblaster (with really no difference in appearance). If you have the first three season box set and the movie, you should get this to add to the collection.",1529884800,,1691,4.651006711409396

8521880,5,B007TX1BN6,"Once I found out these episodes existed, I knew I had to have them. These are not dubbed in English but do have English subtitles so keep that in mind.  I found that after a while I didn't really even realize that I was reading the text.  I highly recommend if you miss watching the original G1 episodes and are looking for more.",1522195200,2,329,4.2063492063492065
