7922640,3,B00004TJNC,"""Boy: 3, Boy Wonder"" (the third part of the series ""Boy""), released as Pride Video PRI-31028 in Canada and the U. S. of A. In the U.K., alternatively, it is titled, apart from any series and numbering thereof, simply as ""Boy Wonder"". The video, as a North American release, is part of that multi-DVD series or (depending on one`s perception) set, ""Boy"", each disc separately packaged for sale. However, this DVD, under either variant of the title, seems to be the same item, differing in playback norm and only slightly differing as repackaged for the container's outside visual aspect, the North American and U.K. editions displaying different photos of Lukas Ridgeston.

I had hesitated even to bother to review ""Boy: 3, Boy Wonder"", but there is enough of worth in it, after all, to justify such attention, even if this third disc in the series is less interesting, overall, than its companion DVDs therein. Mostly, what one reads here is only slightly reworded and adapted from comments which I had written earlier about ""Boy: 3"" in reviewing the videos in the ""Boy"" series.

Here is a list of the parts in sequence by series (or set) numbering, of those of which I am aware, of Pride Video`s ""Boy"":

Boy: [1], Bohemian Boys; Sex and Sensuality in Bohemia (Pride Video PRI-31019, as released in Canada and the U.S.). N.B.: The models/actors are unnamed on the container of this DVD, but they include Martin Valko, Daniel Valent, and Johan Paulik among them.

Boy: 2, Boys at Play (Pride Video PRI-31025, as released in Canada and the U.S.). In the U.K. it is titled ""Super Boys"". N.B.: Making only brief appearances on this video are, both of them devastatingly beautiful, Martin Valko and Ken Christy, but the principal actor/model featured, if one can say that there be such, is Lukas Ridgeston. All of the guys are exceptionally handsome, too, each in his own way.

Boy: 3, Boy Wonder (Pride Video PRI-31028, as released in Canada and the U.S.). N.B.: Among the actors/models who are identified adequately by both the usual first and last names by which they choose to identify themselves are Stefan Andersen, Johan Paulik, and Lukas Ridgeston.

Boy: 4, Boy, oh Boy (Pride Video PRI-31018, as released in Canada and the U.S.)

Atop that, there are other Pride Video (now Wolfe Video`s products to sell) titles with ""Boy"" otherwise as part of the wording which seem to be loosely related to the ""Boy"" tetralogy itself, but there is no need to list them also here. Some are distributed on the various national Amazon WWW sites, but all are available from Wolfe Video`s own Website. (When Pride Video folded, Wolfe Video took over its products.)

For collectors of gay erotica for whom Lukas Ridgeston and Johan Paulik are especially of interest, ""Boy: 3, Boy Wonder"" features them to a greater extent than some of the other videos in the ""Boy"" series happen to do. Ridgeston and Paulik, both among the greatest gay male erotic celebrities on video, appear in scenes from footage in which they were filmed looking somewhat (at least to my eyes) more boyishly youthful and almost adolescently ardent than in other such excerpts featuring these two which appear in Pride Video's ""Boy"" series.

Lukas Ridgeston, in ""Boy: 3"", has a scene copulating with a lad whom the video calls ""Claus"", a fine beauty who is more sleekly slender and more junior-looking than Ridgeston himself. One also sees ""Claus"" in ""Boy: 3"" self-pleasuring himself, with vigourous abandon, to highly agreeable effect.

Elsewhere in ""Boy: 3"", the moments devoted to the two most juvenile-looking blond lads, named ""Danny"" and ""Marek"", feature them as the youngest-looking (especially the shorter of the two) and most adolescently playful of this video's boys. That makes for a real treat for viewers who particularly fancy ""twinks"".

Not to forget Johan Paulik's scene, ""Boy: 3"" pairs him with a superbly handsome lad (especially for his impish and delightfully characterful face) called ""Rikki"", making this yet another exceptionally appealing scene in Johan Paulik's large videography.

The most beauteous of the young men in ""Boy: 3"", however, is Stefan Andersen, whose magnificently contoured and muscularly well developed (but, thankfully, not bulky) body and finely aristocratic face look like he could have sprung grippingly to one's attention in a Caravaggio male nude oil painting. Andersen's scene, opening the video, has him lolling languorously on a couch, masturbating, though not to a full tumescence visible to the camera. The young dude's sheer beauty makes it possible for his sexually low-voltage scene not to seem unduly disappointing.

That, briefly, is that about this enjoyable but rather less than electrifying video, which is worth having, anyway. The buyer might consider first purchasing others of the ""Boy"" videos before getting around to acquiring this one.",1387411200,,4857,5.048689138576779
