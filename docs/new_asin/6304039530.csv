766943,5,6304039530,If you're lucky enough to have a 3D TV and are a film (or especially Hitchcock) aficionado you are in for a treat.  It has been almost impossible to see Dial M in 3D even when it was first released (the 3D fad was ending so most theaters showed it in 2D.).  It's fascinating to see the way Mr. Hitchcock used the process in creating this film,1521244800,,342,4.08955223880597

766948,5,6304039530,"I bought this movie for my wife, the Hitchcock fan, when we got a 3D TV. She already had it on DVD, but it was super fun to see such an old and classic movie in its originally shot 3D! Apart from that 3D, this is one of Hitchcock's best and among the wife's favorites. Grace Kelly puts in her usual stunning performance, Ray Milland makes a very debonair antagonist, and John Williams (no, not the composer) makes the dapper detective. Note that this was originally shot in 3D, just before that fad faded at that time. If you are a Hitchcock fan and have a 3D TV, this is definitely worth the purchase even if you've already got the movie in 2D.",1520640000,,645,4.252032520325203

I have seen this movie so many times that I can practically say the sentence right along with the actor. But, good acting and a good plot never grow old.

767193,4,6304039530,"Haunting Alfred Hitchcock, Captivating Grace Kelly, Cunning Bob Cummings and Murderous Ray Milland may be correct or not but the film is haunting, captivating, cunning and murderous.  The film was filmed in 3D but for some reason only released in 2D.  The fact that after 58 years the 3D print was even good enough to rebuild is amazing.  For those that think in today's technology, try to remember that this film was released in 1954 using the technology of the time.  Cellular phones were first used in the 1960's and the first 15 inch color tube tv's went on sale the year this film came to theaters in color with wide screen CinemaScope.

767195,5,6304039530,"Movie is great, always have liked Ray Milland. Grace Kelly does a great job here as well.
I played this back on my Sony upscaling 4K Blu-ray player and on the Ultra 4K TV 55"". The player is 3D capable, but not my TV.
Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie all the way through.
For some reason, like WB's ""House of Wax"", the picture just doesn't look as sharp as I think it could be at times. I know, I'm expecting everything to be sharp HD now, but some of the vintage movies put on Blu-ray by WB should have looked better all around. I think it's the camera being used by WB at the time of making the movie. Facial features appear a bit blurry at times.
* Special Features are Theatrical Trailer and a Featurette on the movie.
The disc I own has the 3D and 2D feature on the same disc. So, all good there. Find a good deal for this movie, if you can.",1511827200,,845,4.065868263473054

I don't know if the problem is that Amazon sent me a version that won't play in the US or it's because it's poor Mexican craftsmanship.

I first saw it on campus at a university in 1967, and over the last 50 years I have watched it 5-6 times, without a moment of boredom.  The acting by Ray Milland and Grace Kelly is top-rate.  The plot is absorbing, and you have to watch carefully to avoid missing any of the twists and turns and clues of this mystery-suspense gem.  Tony (Milland) explains his plan for the perfect murder (of Tony's wife) to his partner in crime, but when the plan becomes reality, so much goes awry that Tony has to improvise another crime to get his wife, played by Grace Kelly, sentenced to death for murder.

I had to track down the problem and re-order it weeks later on May 24th. If something gets lost in the system, this broken part of the system needs to be re-worked.

767390,3,6304039530,"Hitchcock was always interested in technology -- sometimes for its own sake -- so one can imagine him recognizing how effective the attempted murder scene would be in 3D. And it is. It's pure, perfect Hitchcock -- including the visual implication of murder = rape.

The fundamental problem with this edition is the poor print quality. It's dark, muddy, and smeary, both the 3D and 2D versions. The supplemental material (from 2004) uses a 2D print that's bright, crisp, detailed, and lively.

And that's not all. The 3D is decidedly weird, with many scenes showing severe ghosting that comes and goes -- with the same camera angles and character positions! And some of the ""ghosting"" artifacts appear in the 2D version (presumably the left 3D image)!

Whether there's a better 3D pair, I don't know. But if there is, it wasn't used for this release.

By the way, this is a true widescreen film. If you doubt this, there are two moments of pan-and-scan in the supplemental material.",1493424000,2,981,4.821428571428571

Believing he has hatched the perfect murder, all thats left is to coerce an old school chum into doing the dastardly deed.  Unfortunately, all his plans instantly go awry due to a faulty watch, a not-so-missing key, a strategically placed pair of scissors, and a wife unwilling to be strangled.  When an Inspector (John Williams) comes to call, Tony has all the answers at the ready.  But are they the right answers.

Ray Milland, former English professional tennis play, is married to wealthy socialite Grace Kelly, who has had an affair with American crime-fiction writer Robert Cummings. When Ray retires in response to her complaints about his always being away, he secretly discovers the affair and decides to murder her - for revenge and to ensure that her money will continue to finance his lifestyle.

Ray meets an acquaintance (Anthony Dawson) from the University of Cambridge, who has become a small-time criminal, and follows him so he can blackmail him into murdering Grace. The plan goes wrong and Grace stabs Anthony to death. Diligent detective work and a few errors by Ray unwind the plot and lands him in jail

767720,3,6304039530,"The movie is a classic and is worth 5 stars...but this Blu-ray 3D release is not great. ""Ghosting"" (a faint double image) is quite pronounced at times, especially during dark scenes. During some brightly lit scenes there is a faint blue-ish halo effect around the actors. Of course, none of these artifacts were in the original film. Thankfully a 2D version is included. (This is, in fact, how most movie goers saw the film during its original release anyway. The 3D version had limited theatrical release.) And if you're expecting a 3D extravaganza with loads of in-your-face effects, look elsewhere. Hitchcock's use of the process is very subtle most of the time. (I think he was pressured into making a 3D film by the studio, and I'll bet he deliberately chose a story that had next to no action just to vex them.)

The film itself is a good example of how Hitchcock could make even a talky, static stage play quite engaging. And if you're a Columbo fan you'll enjoy the dramatic device of knowing the details of the crime while watching the detective work through the puzzle. I'm not aware of the creators of Columbo ever acknowledging this film as an inspiration, but it certainly seems that it must have been.

All in all, not a bad purchase if you can get it cheap. I got mine when the price dropped to $10. You can never go wrong with Hitchcock.",1482192000,4,1353,4.586776859504132

767846,5,6304039530,"While Hitchcock tends to dismiss DIAL M as a lesser effort it is actually an excellent example of what he could do in a confined space. Hitch loved to see what could be done with confinement in such films as ROPE, LIFEBOAT and REAR WINDOW. DIAL M was made at the height of the 1953 3-D effort of Hollywood to lure customers away from their televisions. The Blu-ray disc includes the ability to watch the film in 2-D on non 3-D system or to screen the 3-D version if you have the needed set-up. The 3-D version is fascinating and Hitchcock uses it as a story telling tool that takes place mostly within the confines of an apartment, ignoring the gimmick aspect of the process. It remains one of the best uses of the 3-D process. Ray Milland gives a chilling performances as a man plotting to have his wife murdered. This was the first of three films that Grace Kelly did for the director and the second for Robert Cummings who had stared in Hitchcock's SABOTEUR. The film was shot in Warner Color (Eastman color) rather then the much better Technicolor so there is more grain but the this is a nice transfer of a very satisfying Hitchcock film.",1474934400,13,1143,4.447619047619048

Then, Milland's strange behavior in trying to keep Margot from going out for the evening must have been noticed by Robert Cummings. Margot's conviction is outright silly.

Milland's smugness throughout the story is hard to take.

What saves the movie is John Williams, who is fooled by nothing and who patiently lays the trap that will catch Ray Milland.

While this is pretty much a regular Hitchcock film: pretty leading actress, glamorous people/setting, murder, etc, it was one of a few that was very dark. Yes, murder is dark. But this movie was about cold, very cold people. One of the reasons this is not my favorite Hitchcock movie. Secondly I don't know if the Grace Kelly character is supposed to be an Englishwoman or an American but her over pronunciation of works to effect a British accent or to be ""proper"" was just flat out annoying. It reminds me of young people over the last 5 years or so who do that? Giving words more syllables than they have to sound intelligent or important (or maybe it is insecurity  . . . dunno). Just silly. And lastly the big reveal, if you will, was just weak. And I have tried several times to watch this film over the years but it is just too much talking. They just rattle the lines off as if they are in a hurry. No acting to it. Just reciting lines. And then you get up to the ending and you respond,""That is it? That is the big moment?"" I just feel that this is a big to-do about nothing actually. Even the way they link the title to the story is just silly. Just an all around weak movie, to me.",1456617600,2,1426,4.277777777777778

768482,5,6304039530,"This is a 'Columbo' style murder movie where you are shown how the murder is done. Then it is a battle of wits between the murderer and the Inspector of Scotland-Yard.

The murderer plans in great detail and has someone else do the dastardly deed, so, the true murderer can have an alibi elsewhere. The murderer both blackmails and bribes this accomplice .

There is an unexpected plot twist, which would seem to foil the murderer. However, the murderer is quick on his feet, and calmly adapts and uses these unexpected new circumstances for his ends in a new plan.

It all is very believable; the murderer has a motive; a reason to be angry. Grace Kelly is the victim and so likeable and innocent. The murderer is clever.

The Inspector has more than one suspect, but even if he can narrow it down to one person; he then has to come up with proof, and this murderer has been careful to leave no proof. It will take a Columbo style test of setting-up the murderer to retrieve something only the murderer would know about.

As you are told of the murderer's plot; you realize this movie is moving at a fast pace, and the beginning scenes are all necessary to the plot; not a moment is wasted. Even the first minute starts out with bang as you subtly realize Grace Kelly is kissing a man, who is not her husband.

This is an excellent movie. The movie seemed boring to me at first; so I fast-forwarded to the end; saw the end was so clever, which grabbed me and I went back and watched it from the beginning, and enjoyed it. I suggest you watch it from the start.",1435536000,,1561,4.36551724137931

768487,4,6304039530,"Money and greed.  Love, hate, and marriage.  These are universal plot drivers in literature, but especially mysteries.  And they help form the plot for Hitchcocks Dial M for Murder as well.

Based on a play of the same name, the movie tells the story of Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot Mary (Grace Kelly) Wendice.  Tony used to be a tennis pro, traveling all over the world.  But a year ago, he gave that up, and their marriage has never been better.

All of that is a sham, however.  While Tony was off playing tennis, his wife had fallen in love with Mark (Robert Cummings), an American mystery writer over in England for a few months.  She broke it off, but Tony already knew and has been plotting his revenge ever since.  See, she is rich, so he must kill her and create the perfect way to do so in order to inherit her money.  He blackmails an old college friend into helping him commit the crime.  But will he get away with murder?

Since this movie was based on a play, much of the action takes place in the flat of Tony and Margot Mary.  It doesnt stay strictly in that one location, but it is close.  I realize that is one of Hitchcocks trademarks to increase tension, but I like it because the one location is all you need.  Much more than we got would absolutely create a distraction, something I wish people adapting plays today would understand.  Instead, it keeps the audience focused on the story, so we feel the same tension the characters do.

When Hitchcock is at the top of his game, I can find myself drawn into a movie and on the edge of my seat.  I wasn't quite that engrossed in this movie.  However, I certainly enjoyed it.  There was a twist coming I didn't expect, and seeing how everything would play out was fun.  I wasn't on the edge of my seat, but it certainly kept my attention.

The acting from everyone was great.  This was the first time that Hitchcock worked with Grace Kelly, and they obvious enjoyed it since they made two more films together.  Ray Milland and Robert Cummings were equally good as the male leads.  And John Williams, who played Chief Inspector Hubbard was very fun when he came into the story as well.

While not reaching the top tier of Hitchcocks films for me, I certainly did enjoy it, and Id watch it again.  If you haven't seen Dial M for Murder yet, plan to do so today.",1434153600,,2329,4.3534883720930235
768488,1,6304039530,"Bought our first Blu-Ray player and have been having a blast trying out assorted Blu-Ray discs and comparing them to the DVD versions. ""Dial M For Murder"" (not reviewing the 3D version) has been a favorite for many years and own the 2006 Warner Home Video DVD. When we started playing the Blu-Ray disc, we were rather surprised at the graininess of the picture from the very first credits screen. The sound wasn't very well restored either. By the time it had played about 60 seconds of the film, we realised what was really wrong with the picture. They zoomed the original 4:3 picture! This harkens back to the old VHS tape days of ""Pan and Scan"". We quickly loaded the DVD in our DVD player and checked that the movie was 4:3. It was. So, we compared and the Blu-Ray picture quality is literally the level of the DVD when you select the ""Zoom"" option on the TV screen.

The DVD gave a clearer picture and the whole picture! I don't know what you would get out of the 3D experience on the Blu-Ray, as most of the 3D filming that Hitchcock did was by placing furniture in between the camera and the subject, hence the tables, lamps, or bottles that are so often in the forefront of the shot. Zooming the picture wold cut out most of that and lessen the 3D look of the film. From a 2D standpoint, the Blu-Ray is a loser all around. Original film ration modified by cheap zooming, which cuts the clarity and removes part of the film. I can zoom it myself on the TV and achieve the same level of quality and still retain the option of seeing the original film in the original ratio. The audio track is not as nice as the DVD version, which is crisper and clearer. All in all, for true Hitchcock fans and fans of this movie --- stick with the DVD and avoid this poor Blu-Ray release!

768666,2,6304039530,"If you are a die hard Hitchcock fan you will like this film, maybe.  I suspect that there are people who claim to love a film just because it is directed by a master.  I'm not own of them.  I've liked a lot of his films; this is probably the least thrilling of all of them.  On the plus side Grace Kelly is lovely in her prime.  The two men, Cummings and Milland are adequate.  They look good in suits and hats.  The colors are vivid and pleasant; it might have perked up the film if some of it had been shot outdoors in London.

I read here that the film was made from a stage play and that makes sense of a lot of it.  It probably would have worked well as a play.  Here the opportunities that film brings are pretty much wasted.

The plot is ok but there is way too much dialog enplaning the mechanisms of the murder and the subsequent cover up.  The husband is totally unbelievable. I would have liked more character development There is a lot of talk about latchkeys which is supposed to be crucial.  I lost track of the whereabouts of the various latchkeys and after a while I didn't care.  I ended up fast forwarding it.  I wish I'd done that from the beginning.  It's interesting as an historical piece, maybe, when women were docile and men wore suits and hats every day.

768813,5,6304039530,"There is one reason you must see this DVD: you have not seen this acclaimed film like Hitchcock filmed it in over 50 years. Originally shot in Cinemascope and 3-D, since then you saw the film on TV in grainy, pan-and-scan, washed-out colors. Even laser disc owners were banned from seeing it sharply. Technology changes allowed studios to cheaply restore its picture clarity and dimensions to glory. Oh, just a minor lure, this is Grace Kelly's finest acting job captured in her refined silky splendor. There are so many reasons to see this film for film students, mystery writers and admirers one could talk til dusk. I'll mention the obvious: originally this was a hit play that Alfred Hitchcock altered slightly, filming the entire suspenseful, cat-and-mouse story in just a couple locales. Inside a swank London apartment, the street outside the apartment and inside a men's club. The way the master Hitchcock framed the camera brings alive the pointedly clever dialogue between the suave, debonair (Ray Milland, personal best film),his unhappy spouse Grace Kelly, her new flame (Robert Cummings) and the cagey inspector (John Williams). I'm not going to say more so you see this film as you never have unless at its premiere and it will stick you to your chair until its climactic finish. A more debonair, cunning villain oozing charm has never made it to the screen since. The special features, one being excellent commentary from Peter Bogdanovich and others explain the obsession of film lovers for this film. This is not just a two-thumbs up film, this is both hands all fingers. When you see Grace Kelly in a bare-ly shrouded red wrap gown and in blue satin draping nightie and you hang on her every terrified word, you are seriously a certified cinema buff, you have as Rod Serling intoned,""entered the Hitchcock zone"" at its best.",1417910400,11,1842,4.92604501607717

768937,3,6304039530,"Hitchcock agreed to make this movie to finish his Warner Brothers contract and move to Paramount where he would not only retain creative control but own some of his movies (""Rear Window"", ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""Vertigo).  Apparently the director wasn't pleased with shooting in 3D and there were problems with the equipment during principal photography where is why there are some non 3-D shots in the film.  Also, Hitchcock preferred to work with the Technicolor lab which offered superior processing and dye transfer release prints rather than the shoddy Warnercolor which had grainy opticals.  In any event, he made an entertaining if somewhat stagey thriller with good performances and a famous murder scene.  This was part of the director's experimentation of creating a suspense story in a confined location which was attempted with ""Lifeboat"", ""Rope"" and this movie.  He finally got it right (if not perfect) with ""Rear Window"" after which he abandoned that concept.  The film had a very limited release in 3D back in 1954 since the cycle of dimensional pictures had fizzled out.  The problem of keeping two projectors in perfect synchronization cause grief for some theater owners. The original 3D and flat versions were shown in the 1:85 ratio. The movie was re-released in 1979-1980 with new dual projector prints and shown in 1:33.  Warner Brothers also made a single strip 3D version for a broader re-release in 1981 also in 1:33. The advantage of the square format was that more of the image was shown and Warnercolor needed all the help it could get, especially the grainy opticals that used the inferior duplicating stock of the time.  (Note: The Paramount VistaVision format had camera negative opticals because they negative was A & B rolled meaning that each negative went through the printer twice and the fades and dissolves were made as the image was exposed).  This Blu ray release does contain the original color timing (which is good considering how faded the negative(s) must be so many decades later) but it was mastered in 1:85 (16:9).  That means the somewhat grainy Warnercolor image was enlarged to crop the top and bottoms of the frame.  This makes the image even grainier than it was in the eighties 3D re-issue.  I would've preferred the film released in 1:33 to show more of the photographed image which would've reduced the grain.  Or at least, they should've offered both aspect ratios for consumers.  The film actually looks fine in either ratio in terms of composition and since most people saw it in 3D in 1:33 between 1979-1981, that would've looked better on Blu ray in that ratio since digital tends to exaggerate the grain of a movie.  If the film is fine grain to begin with, it will look ultra-fine grain digitally (i.e. ""The Trouble with Harry"").  However, if the movie is a little grainy to begin with, the digital format will exaggerate that grain and make it more noticeable.  That aside, the subtle use of 3D does enhance the narrative but there are only two 'off screen' shots that the process was known for at the time...the murder scene and the key in the hand.  Otherwise, the depth is used to open up the confined set.",1408838400,21,3206,4.84954128440367

769162,5,6304039530,"Alfred Hitchcock committed many fictional murders onscreen, but I suspect he knew that few of them would plausibly work in real life.

In fact, ""Dial M for Murder"" is all about how murders can never be pulled off perfectly -- especially the complex, think-on-your-feet types that are usually seen in murder mysteries. In this adaptation of the stage play, Hitchcock keeps a low-simmering tension throughout the story, even as he juggles several clues and misdirections that end up tangling all the wrong people. It's not a question of whodunnit, but whether the truth will be found.

Wealthy socialite Margot Wendice (Grace Kelly) has been carrying on a secret affair with crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). But when a love letter from Mark (the MacGuffin!) is stolen from her handbag, she reveals to Mark that she's currently being blackmailed by an unknown person. Her husband Tony (Ray Milland), seemingly oblivious to both the blackmail and the love affair, invites Mark to a stag party.

The twist: Tony knows all about the affair, and he is the one who stole the letter. He's also afraid that if Margot leaves him, he'll be left destitute since she has all the money.

So he enlists an old schoolmate named Swann (Anthony Dawson) to murder his wife, and stages the ""perfect"" crime and alibi. But things go wrong when Margot manages to stab Swann with a pair of scissors, and the carefully-arranged crime becomes a tangled web of clues and secrets that all seem to incriminate Margot. Will the truth be found before she is hung, or will Tony get away with murder?

While ""Dial M For Murder"" is based on a stage play by Frederick Knott (who also adapted it for the movie), it's one of those stories that just feels very Hitchcockian. There's a ""wrong woman,"" a MacGuffin, murder schemes, a beautiful blonde, a high-society setting and a charmingly genteel psychopath who calmly plans the murder of his wife just because he wants her money -- it seems perfectly designed for Hitchcock's storytelling style.

The first half of the movie is devoted to the ""perfect crime"" going wrong. While Tony insists that he's planned out the perfect murder, little unexpected things cause his scheme to go awry -- a stopped watch, an old man, a pair of scissors, and a missing key. The second half... well, it's about untangling the same web from Margot, and somehow figuring out how it all applied to Tony. There are some leaps in logic, but for the most part it juggles the clues well.

And Hitchcock brings a low-simmering sense of suspense to the story, with events unfolding prety slowly... until Swann tries to strangle Margot, when everything becomes raw and visceral. Despite the languid pacing, he actually keeps the movie pretty lean and nimble. For instance, Margot's entire legal battle is summed up in a nightmarish montage of questions and condemnations, and it lasts less than a minute before she's condemned to death.

This is probably the best performance I've yet seen from Grace Kelly -- she gasps and sobs incoherently through the attempted murder, slowly crumbles through the investigation, and floats numbly through the final act. Milland gives a chillingly genial performance, although Cummings is just kind of... well, he's enthusiastic, but the character is an idiot. And of course, there's John Williams as the veddy veddy British Inspector Hubbard, who is much more devious than anyone gives him credit for.

""Dial M For Murder"" can be a bit slow at times, but the slow-burning tension and intricate plot were beautifully handled by Hitchcock -- and the clever subversion of the ""perfect crime"" makes a nice brain-bender.",1395100800,,3656,4.951060358890701
769163,5,6304039530,"When Hollywood had a star system, better writers and better actors were used. Ideas were original, not just recycled.

I can watch this film over and over again and see something diffrent every time. Does ""A Perfect Murder"" (Douglas and Paltrow) compare? It's cold, almost lifeless despite the fine acting.

A 3D experience is complicated by several factors, including distance from the screen -- the angle of the viewing pyramid from eye to screen.  And size of onscreen objects.  For instance a different movie (John Carpenter) had some wonderful little horses in 3D, but only if viewed closer to the TV than is comfortable for the whole movie.  Even a real 3D diorama looks flat when viewed from too far away.  And people have personal preferences how close to sit, often different between movie theater and at home.

Ray Milland does a good job as Tony Wendice, the calculating manipulative husband trying to rid himself of his rich wife while holding onto her money.  Milland comes up with a plan to have his wife murdered but when things do not go as planned he must scramble to come up with a new one.  He improvises well and arranges an alternate solution to his problem.  Chief Inspector Hubbard played by John Williams comes off as a competent policeman who is suspicious of the manipulated clues that he finds from the start.  They all point to Margot and he faithfully records each and every one but he is never quite convinced that all is as it seems.

769524,5,6304039530,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Alfred Hitchcock classic...

Dial M For Murder (1954) stars Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, Robert Cummings, and John Williams.  Originally a 3D movie, this movie has a simple plot and story and takes place in pretty much one setting, but the suspense and tension is what makes this movie work so well, not to mention the fact that it keeps you guessing.  The acting is good and Hitchcock's direction is superb.  This was the first of three Hitchcock movies that Grace Kelly appeared in (the other two are Rear Window and To Catch A Thief, 1954 and 1955, respectively).  This is a very wordy movie, but that is not necessarily a negative.

If you want to watch a suspenseful movie that's entertaining, then I highly recommend Dial M For Murder.  This movie is from Hitchcock's golden period of the 1950s when he really could do no wrong.",1386720000,,927,4.644171779141105

769598,3,6304039530,"I was curious to see the movie intentionally shot in 3D with the great Alfred Hitchcock as director. He withdrew the 3D version before the film hit the theaters and only now can we see it as it was intended to be seen. However, the filming of what was originally a stage play, which Hitch felt should not be ""opened up"" as most stage to film productions usually are, didn't really gain anything through its 3D format and it was obvious from time to time that objects in the foreground between the viewer and the actors were put there only to increase the depth. In addition, there is a fuzziness to the images that seem foreign to the 3D medium, a fuzziness that would have been acceptable in its time (1954) but not today, when we associate the most contemporary 3D films with the high definition that the technology has achieved. Hitch himself thought of 3D as a gimmick and was probably wise to release the film in 2D after that initial craze had passed.
The film is interesting in either format, however, to see how Hitchcock actually uses his directorial tricks and choice of actors to make us feel sympathy for Grace Kelly and empathy for Ray Milland, her would-be killer, and less identification with Robert Cummings, the ""hero"" much more at home with light comedies, whose dramatic technique consists primarily of frowning and sneering. John Williams' overlong ""wrap-up"" of the events and denouement is a weakness of the film, in my opinion, much as Simon Oakland's evaluation of Tony Perkins at the end of ""Psycho.""  Highly recommended, however, for the story, direction and acting, less so for the 3D format.",1381190400,7,1618,4.73758865248227

Yes, rear projection is flat and some inserts are grainy, but that is precisely the way it was originally shot. The restoration is completely faithful to the original. Hitchcock made what is probably the most intelligent use of the 3D ever, making the movie look like a play on a stage (the story was originally a play). Grace Kelly's hand reaching out is the most carefully crafted and impressive 3D shot I have seen. The use of the 3D is so good that one gets to foget about it to be just immersed in the story.

Since the entire film is mostly in one room, it's interesting to see where Hitchcock shows up in his famous cameos.",1373328000,,497,4.477777777777778

Grace Kelly looks stunning in 3-D while Ray Milland and John Williams are nothing short of sublime.

769991,5,6304039530,"In these days of computer generated battles in space and earth shaking surround sound, it's refreshing to find a throwback to the kind of mystery which involves the viewer and makes him think. Now, I like space battles and plaster-cracking sound as much as the next guy, but this movie pulled me in and made me try to figure out the characters and care about them.

Shot almost entirely in a single room, this is the simple story of a man (Ray Milland) who plots to murder his wife (Grace Kelly) in order to be rid of her and inherit her wealth. Why anyone would want to murder and be rid of Grace Kelly is not spelled out, but there's an old line about no matter how foxy she is, there's someone who's up to here with her and wants her gone. The reason is not the point. He wants to be rid of her and he's smooth and devious and calculating, and what he comes up with is both brilliant and complicated. In typical Hitchcock fashion, complications ensue.

Robert Cummings is the smooth, non-smarmy lover, and his character, a mystery writer, adds an important plot element.

The cinematic style is thoroughly Hitchcock, which means it's a little dated and flat-footed by today's norms, and the characters are always perfectly dressed and groomed. In this case, it works, as the viewer can be absorbed into the story without being distracted by details. Except for the old-fashioned telephone, the arrival of RMS Queen Mary, and the fact that everyone smokes, it could be any time in recent history.

The 3D thing works. Hitchcock evidently understood that it could be used to engage the viewer and more bring him into the scenes and settings, and it is always subtle. A frequent device is the use of something in the foreground with the characters behind, like a row of bottles or a lamp. There is in fact only ONE instant in which a character reaches out directly into the viewer's face, and this features one of the key plot clues and elements.

Sharp-eyed viewers accustomed to 3D will realize the scene of the ocean liner is a flat backdrop projected on a screen behind the characters. No matter. It's an involving story in which the viewer finds himself in a small room with a small cast of characters as a complicated and devious plot unfolds.

Even if you've seen this one before, I think you'll find the 3D version adds to the intimacy of it.",1369612800,2,2350,4.556872037914692
769992,3,6304039530,"Pretty much a straightforward filming of the play, done when Hitchcock was out of ideas for another film. Hitchcock uses 3D very sparingly.

However, it is Hitchcock's clever way of watching the police solve the murder mystery with a good cast. As the only female in the film, there is nothing special about Grace Kelly in this movie. My review is of the 3D Blu-Ray. I think it's fun to see it in 3D, but the 3D is of the 1950's. The 3d technology of today is so advanced that you look at this 3D movie almost as an antique, although it is still good. However, there is really no reason for this movie to be made in 3D as there are no special effects requiring this technology.

769997,5,6304039530,"A lot has already been said about the film, so I won't bother trying to add my opinion. Instead, I will only describe my experience with the 3D component of this special edition Blu-Ray.

Being new to the world of 3D TV, I struggled with what would be my first acquisition.  It goes without saying that I wanted to get a film that had originated in 3D, instead of being back-converted.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the team at Warner Brothers had actually gone back and re-mastered Hitchcock's only 3D film, 1954's ""Dial M for Murder"" into the Blu-Ray 3D format.

I was intrigued until I started reading some of the reviews, some of which complained of ghosting and image quality. What finally did convince me was a single review that claimed that there were no issues at all with their Vizio TV with passive 3D glasses. Since this was my exact set-up, I took the plunge and bought it.

To say that I was amazed would be an understatement.  I was actually fortunate enough to see this film in 3D in a theater about 20 years ago during a retrospective of the format, and although the 3D worked, the print had shown its age.  Digital re-mastering has cleaned up a lot of the faded colors, and this version actually looks better than what I saw in that theater.  I did notice what looked like a filter over the entire image that made it look grainy, and perhaps this was an attempt to mask inconsistencies in image grain across different scenes. This is borne out by the title sequence, which is so sharp that it looks like it was photographed yesterday.  However, the colors and brightness overall are vivid and make for a beautiful visual experience (as does Grace Kelly, whether she's in two or three dimensions).

But I digress.  One piece of advice I can give to anyone considering purchasing this Blu-Ray is to be aware that the film was shot during the early days of 3D, so the format had its limitations back then.  The re-mastering team has done a fantastic job of restoring critical image registration, but they can't do anything about Hitchcock's penchant for using process shots for exteriors. Don't be surprised when you see an outdoor scene and the background looks flat, because it actually was projected onto a 2D screen behind the actors when it was originally shot. Finally, I strongly advise watching the film at night, with the lights turned out. Any ghosting that I saw was caused by background lighting reflecting off my TV screen. Turning out the lights fixed everything.

The only way this disc could make me happier is if the Warner Brothers team had also included ""Lumber Jack Rabbit,"" the only 3D Merrie Melodies cartoon.  Perhaps they are saving this for another release.  ""House of Wax"", perhaps?",1367280000,5,2738,4.663201663201663
769998,5,6304039530,"I have enjoyed this movie many times over the year, but had never seen it in the original 3D until recently. This is the best 3D movie yet. I should not have been surprised as Hitchcock is by far THE best director ever (my opinion).
Hitchcock was able to add depth to the scenes, without a computer, that I just have not seen done by anyone else.
Avatar is excellent in 3D, but Dial M for Murder is great in 3D.

2013/09 Update - I now have seen a better 3D in a movie, and yes it is a Turtle's Tale 2.  This is still an excellent use of 3D without the gimmicks, and truly enhances the viewing experience.",1367020800,2,605,4.07563025210084

This may not be the Master's best film but a mediocre Hitchcock is better than any of the so-called suspense or slasher thrillers that are prominent on the screen today (forget about Paranormal or Grudge)---this flick is quality cinema!!  And though Cary Grant was interested in playing the scondrel husband, Ray Milland does such a great job that one almost wants him to root for him to get away with it. He belongs in the great gallery of Hitchcock villains who are suave and gentlemanly despite being dastardedly like James Mason or George Saunders.  And of course, Grace Kelly, still is the epitome of beauty and elegance as she proved again in Hitch's films like ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch A Thief"" while proving her chops as a serious actress, deglamorized, in her Oscar winning role in ""The Country Girl"".  Only Robert Cummings, who was much better in ""Saboteur"", an earlier Hitchcock film, is disappointly bland and wooden in the role of Kelly's lover.  There are still some of the defects of early 3D like ghosting and double imaging but despite these flaws, this film is still worth seeing because it is a Hitchcock film.",1365984000,2,1305,4.656521739130435

What made the movie was Ray Miland, his good looks and dastardly charm sell the movie, the police inspector puts a smile on your face and Grace Kelly looking off into space for most of the movie wipes that smile right off. OK the woman is beautiful but she might as well been a lamp.

770256,4,6304039530,"There have been many complaints about this one in 3d. However this looked the same when shown in 3d in the 1980's. (As far as depth goes) Some scenes do have a double image though and that's not good.  The 2d version has the same halo effect around some characters and the picture itself was never very vibrant. This movie is in fact restored, all the lines and scratches have been taken off the print. But even when it was completed it was never a shining example of a great 3d movie. In fact it is more like a stage play, but a good one with good actors. Bob Cummings , Grace Kelly and Ray Milland do their best in this average movie. It's Hitchcocks weakest film probably of that period in his career. Still a weaker Hitch film still has many fine elements and camera angles that are very good. I do hope that more early 3d movies are released , Hondo should have been put out that way. It was a far better 3d movie , and there's alot more titles that could be put out from the fifites 3d library. They will sell and should be out for the rest of us to enjoy. However this one isn't the strongest of that era. In fact it's one of the weaker in that regard. Not acting wise but in overall appearance. Still the 3d version does look better than the 2d version on this disc. I don't think the price is a good one though. A older movie shouldn't be more than 20.00 at most. There are extras on here , but don't expect a modern 3d experience , and even when it was released they didn't do the 3d until decades later! If  you want a better 3d flick from this period then grab 'creature from the black lagoon' , but film fans like me wouldn't have this one any other way. It was shot in 3d , so I want it in 3d.

770360,4,6304039530,"I will not go into the details of the movie, as this has been done countless times already.  I am only rating based on picture quality and 3D.

I was a little disappointed in the overall quality of the picture, but for a 60 year old film, I can live with the graininess and lack of sharpness.  Overall, the picture quality was acceptable.  Nowhere near today's standards, but again, this film is 60 years old.

I had never seen this film before, so was eagerly awaiting it's release, to see it in 3D.  The story itself was gripping, in the usual Hitchcock fashion, and supenseful to the end.  I was a bit surprised at the story line, as I was confusing this with one of my favorite Barbara Stanwyck films - ""Sorry, Wrong Number"".  I was expecting the plot to be along the lines of that movie.  However, the story line was quite enjoyable.

I don't know why so many people complained about ghosting in the 3D version of the film.  I have two 3D TV's - a 32"" Visio passive (polarized) LCD, and a 42"" Panasonic Plasma Active Shutter TV.

I have to say that the film looked much better on the polarized screen.  There was really not much ghosting at all, even in the beginning credits which were somewhat out of the screen.  On the active shutter plasma, ghosting was much more evident, very much so during the opening credits, and at various points in the film, especially during dark scenes. While it was noticable, it certainly was not to the point of being annoying.  But again, I repeat, this film looks much better on a polarized screen, whcih is the way it was originally shown.

As for 3D effect, it was simply brilliant.  Those that complain about the film being rather flat do not know the correct usage of 3D.  This film uses 3D in a very natural way.

Viewing in 3D is not about things always popping out of the screen.  This is part of the effect of 3D, and sometimes used too much in some films.  This is what gives 3D a bad rap in some people's opinion because they see it as gimmicky.

3D in the cinema should be used to display the image in a natural manner, where you are aware of the depth of the scene, and the relationship and distance between objects.  In this respect, this film handles 3D very nicely.  There were really no ""gimmicky"" popouts, with the exception of the opening credits, and those were comfortably viewed through my polarized TV (not so much with the active Plasma screen).

The only thing that bothered me at times were the outdoor scenes when the front of the building is shown with the street as a backdrop - the buidling and the characters in front of the building were in 3D, but the backdrop was flat.  I can forgive this due to the age of the film and not having the advanced effects that are available today, but it did bother me somewhat.

I too also noticed a blue halo effect around the characters at some points, but it was not overly bothersome.

I did also notice the part near the end where the scene switched to 2D.  At first I hadn't realized, but then it hit me that the scene was 2D.  I don't know if this was intentional or just that that part of the film could nt be restored to 3D.  But more than likely it was intentional as they surely would have mentioned this on the packaging if it was a defect of the transfer.

Overall, a very enjoyable film, one which I will watch many times again.  I am thrilled that I have finally gotten to see this film in 3D.",1352937600,55,3414,4.325984251968504

  I have had a 3D 55"" Sony TV and PS3 for about a year now and have been collecting all the 3D blue rays I can afford.  I just watched ""The Avengers"" and ""Prometheus""  with this system and was thrilled and excited with how well the 3D effect was reproduced.  Then I watched Dial ""M"" for murder.
  The entire movie suffers from severe ""ghosting"".  It actually goes beyond that to double image.  I could not watch it without constant adjustments.  I went on the inter-net to see if I was the only one with this problem, and found many many complaints.  I also found some clue as to how to minimize the problem as I watched.  It meant pausing every ten or twenty minutes and adjusting the depth of field as well as the contrast.
  It was not a matter of just adjusting, but constant fiddling.  It completely spoiled the experience of watching the movie.

770412,4,6304039530,"I love the old Alfred Hitchcock movies for the atmosphere, the suspense, the thrill, and a look back at a bygone age. Dial M for Murder provides all of this. Grace Kelly and Ray Milland are perfect in their roles. The action mainly takes place in just one room giving it a feeling of foreboding and closeness that just adds to the suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was fantastic because you always knew something terrible would happen, but he builds and builds and builds until it does, leaving you almost screaming in anticipation. This movie is up there with his other great thriller ""The 39 Steps"" from the 1930s.",1352505600,3,609,4.700934579439252
770413,5,6304039530,"If a content review is open in this firestorm of product discussion, I would like to offer my take on the subject film.

I found Dial M to be engrossing from start to finish. It has the graceful Kelly, a cool and calculating Ray Milland, still attractive.  With an old theme, it also has a third party love interest for the wife. There was a remake updated to be more amenable to the current times, which was cleverly done, but . . .  As one said, the otherwise attractive female lead in the remake appears gawky compared to Grace Kelly.  To me, that's a good way to contrast today's films in general.  Old movie fans generally feel that way.

There are some elements of the mores of the times of this initial film that help put some things together. Society people of that time had no problem with the husband or wife being escorted socially by a friend of the opposite sex, dancing with them at parties, etc. That was fashionable, along with being very formal toward the spouse, definitely uncool to demonstrate marital affection.  Yet, everyone was shocked when affairs took place. The insincere formalities would extend to the two men going out together just on a friend of one basis. Social encounters of the time covered a lot of ground, most of it false.

Since this is a society couple, they also observe the private formalities of the morning kiss, using stock endearments and all that. One may or may not be dear to one another. You generally can't tell on the surface, since it is the common practice. However, in this case, the wife is having an affair, the husband has found out and is busily plotting to ensure the continuance of his meal ticket, in another form. Both continue the shell. That's a bit thick for any era.  It continues to thicken with Margot's wounded response to her husband's attempting to rearrange the setup his way.

Let's step back here a moment, madam: You are cheating on your husband, are you not? And, you are even considering leaving him, is that correct? So, what is all this, ""Oh Tony, how could you"" stuff.  No question, murder is inexcusable on any account, but her adultery is also a serious betrayal. It is more than fair to ask, Margot, how could You?!  Her hypocrisy is there all along, but noticeable particularly after the attack when she runs to him for comfort, with full expectation and entitlement to it. He's her husband after all. But, she's an adulteress after all. Is she an elitist amoral? No, it's more that she's a spoiled society girl, brought up to expect accommodation to come toward her without accountability going from her. And, she's a product of her social system.

The husband also remains culturally polite and civil throughout, including the absurd tender of drinks all around after his confrontation, along with its polite acceptance by the wife. You played the game no matter what.

In any event, as a mystery, this film has an interesting plot, a ""perfect crime"" gone amiss.  It is regrouped, with the same touch of genius, but ultimately foiled by a persistent inspector with detection of a subtle element. It sustains interest and suspense and to me, has a satisfactory denouement.  As a drama, the mindset of the characters, once placed in their time and social element, are interesting to observe as it all plays out. Great for Hitchcock, Kelly or Milland fans particularly and for those who appreciate the psychological, dialog type of mystery.",1352505600,2,3425,4.711892797319933
770414,5,6304039530,"I like this film better shown wide screen, as it was certainly composed for that possibility....the ""outside"" scenes are very blurry, however....thankfully those scenes are few and far between.... The film never gets really sharp or detailed, but starts to look decent once the film gets going, and as long as we stay inside, everything is okay....definitely watchable, and looks better shown wide (in my opinion).... I am not interested in the 3D aspect, so I won't comment on that....

770415,5,6304039530,"And the answer is definitely go 3D.  Hitchcock was master and meticulous.  He intentionally filmed this film for 3D.  Therefore, many of the shots are with the camera looking up or looking down from on high.  This enhances the 3D effect.  When seen as a flatty, the angles don't make much sense and are sometimes a distraction. It should also be pointed out (I have seen Dial M in 3D both at home and in the theatre) that the 3D in home is better.  The active shutter glasses provide much clearer separation of the images than the passive ones used in theaters.  Also, the 3D from the 50's was done with dual cameras unlike the reprocessed ones of today.  So the the 3D is better than almost any 3D film that you will see today.  The titles in Dial M hang there in front of the screen, Grace Kelly actually reaches out into your living room as she struggles for help, etc.  So, please see this film in 3D.  And, while you are at it, see the new 3D release of Creature from the Black Lagoon.  The effects are amazing.

There are scenes with lots of depth, such as the lamp post or coffee mug in the distance (foreground sometimes) or a glass on the table really appearing 3D. There are so many little touches here and there in this film that I am greatly impressed. I have yet to view Creature From The Black Lagoon. I like all the depth that this 3D film offered. Some 3D releases just look flat or only have one or two scenes of eye candy while nothing is given any depth. Poor 3D versions hurt the entire market for what should be a fun way to enjoy certain movies. I hope future releases look as great as this film did. I have almost every Blu-ray 3D so far, those of us who like this format do not have many choices in the way of 3D films as of yet.

770417,5,6304039530,"Alfred Hitchcock filmed Dial M for Murder in 3D in 1954 and we are the richer for it. Seeing Grace Kelly in her red dress in 3D is a revelation. Can you tell that the film was made in 1954? Yes, there is more grain than in a modern 3D film, most of which are filmed digitally. Is the grain distracting? No, you quickly get into the action and forget about it. The color is brilliant.

Hitchcock frames the 3D images well, with a desk lamp or some nicknacks in the immediate foreground to emphasize the depth. Most of the action takes place in an apartment -- it was based on a stage play after all -- so the 3D consists of foreground, actors and background. But that is enough. The actors all seem too old for their roles, with the exception of Kelly. True, Big Bill Tilden in the day was still playing excellent tennis -- he was 60 when he died in 1953 -- but Ray Milland as former tennis player Tony Wendice was pushing 50 at the time. (Kelly as wife Margot Mary Wendice was 25.)

This is a wonderful film with great actors of the period: Milland, Kelly, Robert Cummings (as the American lover), Anthony Dawson (as the bad guy), and John Williams, one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, as the Chief Inspector. The 3D aspect simply adds to the enjoyment.",1352160000,3,1253,4.35042735042735

This was also Hitch's first color film.  Warner's did a superb job in restoring the old 3D process for this Blu Ray 3D presentation.  My only complaint would be that they present it on this Blu Ray in a 1:85 ratio, when in reality, all the old 3D pictures from 1952 to 54' had a ratio of 1:37.  It would be nice to see Warner's release some of the other 3D pictures from the 1950's on Blu Ray.

Hitchcock's subtle but effective use of 3D wasn't seen by many since 3D was waning at the time and it went into wide release in 2D.  Highly recommended.  However, of disappointment was the attempted restoration which left much to be desired regarding clarity and grain. it looked more like 16mm than 35mm but recommended in any event for it's historic importance.",1351814400,3,483,4.714285714285714
770475,4,6304039530,"""Dial M For Murder"" was filmed 1:37-1 to be seen cropped on a 1:78-1 wide screen (This Blu-ray presents it as 1:77-1).  While this widescreen format does crop a little off of the top & bottom, the old DVD Full Frame 1:33-1 image crops off the sides of the picture.

If you doubt this, just look at the newspaper headline that Grace Kelly is reading near the beginning:
The Full Frame DVD played on my Toshiba player: ""UEEN MARY ARRIVES TODA"". However when I play it on my Sony Blu-ray player it barely says ""QUEEN MARY ARRIVES TODAY"", the first & last letters are slightly cut off on the sides.
The Widescreen Blu-ray has ""QUEEN MARY ARRIVES TODAY"" with plenty of room on the sides.

As of April 1954, Hollywood adopted the new wide screen ratios ranging from 1:66-1 to 1:85-1 as the standard non-anamorphic picture format. ""Dial M For Murder"" was released at the end of May 1954. While ""M"" was filmed with an ""Open Matte"" 1:37-1 ratio, the cinematographers composed the picture framing for 1:78-1 wide screens.  ""M"" looks much better when seen in widescreen, the top & bottom of the picture that are cut-off for in the widescreen version are just 'empty space' while the sides that are cut off on the full frame version make the film feel tight as objects & people are closer to the sides. I rarely come in defense of cropping the top & bottom for widescreen, but to Hitchcock the frame composition was very important and he knew this would be screened in 1:78-1 at the theaters.

If you have a DVD player that does not crop off the letters of the newspaper, then either version is perfectly watchable and will look correct.

Comparing this Blu-ray to the old DVD, outside of the screen ratio difference, the image differs drastically. Both images are soft (possibly characteristic of the Warner-Color Eastman Negatives), but the old DVD is brighter. This darker Blu-ray image may be more characteristic of the ambiance that Hitchcock intended for this dark story.

Some reviewers have commented on some scenes being softer than others. From what I have seen this can be explained by informing non-film makers of the old process of making films.  ""Transition"" effects such as dissolves from one scene to another, or fade-outs & fade-ins required sending these scenes in to the film lab ahead of time. The film lab would then create a new strip of film with the created effects which would be edited into the camera negatives being assembled for the edited film.  THIS MEANS THAT THESE SHOTS, CALLED PROCESS SHOTS, ARE ONE GENERATION FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CAMERA NEGATIVES, thus they are softer.

Could this have been a better transfer, I believe so. But remember that this was not filmed in Technicolor like many of their other color films of that time. The Warner-Color Eastman Negatives may  have faded over the decades. The faults of this Blu-ray presentation may be the faults of the cheaper Warner Color filming.

The PREVIEW TRAILER is presented in letterboxed widescreen on the old DVD, indicating the intended aspect ratio.  On the Blu-ray disc, the PREVIEW TRAILER is formatted 16x9 to fill the screen, but it has jerky movement from up-converting it from the old DVD. It should have been re-transfered from the original film!

***What is missing***
Oddly one of the original documentaries about 3-D is missing from this new 3-D Blu-ray release: ""3-D A Brief History"".  Possibly this is because those interviewed state how they wish they could see ""Dial M For Murder"" in 3-D again as it has been years since they last saw it in 3-D.  And the history lesson in this 7 minute documentary mis-leads you into believing that 3-D was invented in the 1950's when it was already decades old.  A new, updated documentary should have replaced it.",1351555200,7,3746,4.765069551777434

I am not even talking about the disastrous attempt to create 3D effects in a movie that is played with in the wrong ratio (this movie was released BEFORE cinemascope and 16.9 wide screen). But just the blu ray version in 2D is a mess. One minute we are in a scene that is totally out of focus, then crystal clear focus for a while, then back to out of focus for a while. This is commented upon on blu ray.com, but like a lot of other reviews on that site, they are much too kind to this messy release. Regardless of the difficulties of preserving the original 3D print, the 2D blu ray print should be perfect and its really quite schizophrenic. I am surprised the Hitchcock estate has allowed it to be released in this messy state. Let's hope the upcoming blu ray box set is nothing like this. Warners need to withdraw it, ask people to return their copies, release it in the right ratio and find a way to adapt it to blu ray that keeps the movie crystal clear and in focus",1351123200,8,1073,4.188405797101449

770479,4,6304039530,"This is one of Hitchcock's most carefully crafted films. Hitch's daughter once acknowledged that Hitch hated the 3D process, but the methodical way he used 3D to accentuate nearly every scene showed an awareness of how the film should look in the theaters.

Originally shot for projection with polarized glasses, the film was never released in 3D. As much as audiences loved the depth effect, so many bad movies had been rushed into the theaters in 3D that audiences began avoiding 3D films. However, the film has had some rare 3D showings over the years and has gained something of a cult status for 3D fans, much as House Of Wax has.

The package says the film has been digitally remastered. That may be so, but this is a disappointing transfer. First, the film has been reformatted from its original 1.33:1 ratio to a 16:9 format to match wide screen HDTV sets. This means the top and bottom of the frame must have been cropped. Second the video seems slightly out of focus and the color balance feels off. The image looks like it's standard definition, not HDTV. And third, the ""window"" effect has been adjusted so that things that were designed to pop out of the screen -- like Grace Kelly's hand in a key scene (no spoilers here) -- no longer have the same impact.

Warner Bros is planning a 3D release of House Of Wax and other films. I hope they do not make the same mistake there. House Of Wax was designed for things to pop way out of the screen and that was half the fun. But many producers are making the mistake of thinking that everything has to be kept behind the ""window."" Nonsense.

Taking all of the above into consideration, this is still an important release, because it demonstrates what a brilliant director with a good script can do with 3D, using it to make his points without having to resort to cheap gimmicks.

I give credit to Warner Bros for the effort, but I'm beginning to wonder why so many classic films of the past are simply not looking as crisp as they should when they finally make it to Blu-Ray.",1350259200,6,2033,4.4986449864498645
770480,1,6304039530,This movie wasn't shot in a widescreen format.  So who made the decision to crop the frame and artificially create widescreen dimensions?  It's so unnecessary.  Who cares about the blank areas on the left and right.  At least you know you're seeing the entire picture.  The re-framing is so obvious and distracting that I had to stop watching after a few minutes.  I watched the original un-cropped DVD version instead.  It's far superior.  This Blu-Ray version was a waste of money!,1350172800,6,483,4.8765432098765435
770481,3,6304039530,"""Dial M for Murder"" is one of Hitchcock's best. It is by far, Ray Milland's best screen performance. An excellent film. So much for the movie review. The rest of this review is about the 3D blue-ray disc. I've viewed and/or purchased several 3D blue-ray discs since acquiring the needed equipment last spring. It seems that movies that are made specifically for 3D fare much better than movies that are 'converted' from 2D to 3D. ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""John Carter"" are not quite as good as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and ""Hugo"". Even an older black & white film from 1954 that was originally released in 3D, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", looks great in the 3D blue-ray format. So my hopes were high for the 3D blue-ray release of 1955's ""Dial M for Murder"", which was originally filmed in 3D. Sad to say, I was disappointed. There was noticeable 'ghosting' double images throughout, as though the two lenses were not lined up exactly. I haven't noticed this on any other 3D blue ray discs. This became somewhat annoying after a while. Also, I wonder why Warner Brothers chose this film to be filmed in 3D. The only scene that really utilizes the 'magic' of the 3D process is the attempted murder with Grace Kelly's hand reaching out. The rest of the film has its share of bottles and furniture in the foreground, giving the film some depth perspective, but nothing that makes you want to duck and cover. The color is brilliant, the sound is crisp and well-balanced, and, as I said at the onset, the film itself is an excellent suspense thriller. But the 3D is flawed compared to all the other 3D discs I have seen. And, in this case, unnecessary. It adds very little to the enjoyment of the movie. The movie itself - 5 stars. The 3D blue-ray disc - 2-1/2 stars.",1350172800,11,1780,4.531055900621118
770482,2,6304039530,"I've been a 3D nut for many decades. I pre-ordered this from amazon and man, what a disappointment! The video quality is only a little better than the shutterglass 3D DVD bootleg from back in the 90's (and at least the 3D DVD was FULL SCREEN) which was made from a japanese 3D VHD disc. Even the ""red/blue"" 3D trailer for this movie (from the 3D Film Expo at the Egyptian Theatre here in Hollywood) was Full Screen. If you Google this title, you'll find a few websites with photo comparisons (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc...) and you can clearly see that this 3D Blu-ray crops the film from ALL FOUR SIDES. Only a little is cropped from the left/right, but quite a bit is missing from  the top & bottom to create this 1.85 ratio from Full Screen. Some of the 3D perception is lost due to this, and is probably what others here have meant by certain scenes looking ""flat"" or ""2D"". One of the most striking scenes is the one where Margot & Mark are talking in the livigroom. This wonderful shot is obviously setup for the 3D effect. Margot's hand is resting on the end table in the extreme foreground, showing off that beautiful diamond ring. Guess what? In this 3D Blu-ray release, her ENTIRE hand is completely cropped off! I kept noticing these cropped scenes throughout the movie...characters cropped at the waste, tops of lampshades cropped off, etc. Yes, it's great to see that red dress looking REALLY red, but unfortunately the colors are severely oversaturated. I think I'll be holding off on ""House of Wax"" or ""Creature FTBL"" until reviews come in from other guinea pigs out there LOL!
I'm sure others will agree the printed black ink on the Blu-ray disc itself looks horrid. I've seen better labels on bootleg DVDs! Any way, just my 2 cents.",1350086400,5,1750,4.573248407643312
770483,2,6304039530,"First off, I had to take a second look as to who released this title because the menu look like the default menu option you get with a lot of canned DVD apps. Incredibly amateurish.

The movie itself looks horrible. The colors are way over saturated. Some scenes are entirely out of focus. The back-projected scenes look like bad comedy skits. The 3D comes and goes throughout. Towards the end most of the scenes are completely flat. There's no true feeling of depth outside a blurry vase or lamp in the foreground. Even a close of a face shows no highs and lows. There is crosstalk all over the place, including the opening credits.

The movie itself is decent as far as the story. But nothing remarkable.

All that's included as extras is a recycled featurette that had been on the previous DVD and the trailer.

I was extremely disappointed with this release and based on how it was handled, I'm skeptical of the upcoming House of Wax. I've only read bad things about Creature from the Black Lagoon, so I'm also waiting for it to come down in price quite a bit before a purchase.

Oh well.",1349913600,9,1092,4.494949494949495
770484,4,6304039530,"NOTE (added later) :  The problem with the sound that I dwell on in this review turned out to be due to an obscure setting in my equipment, which was extremely difficult to find, because it only caused a problem with this disk.  Most people won't experience this problem, so please don't let my issue with the sound discourage anyone from purchasing this outstanding disk.  Most problems that people complain about with 3-D Blu-ray disks are due to settings in the home equipment and are not caused by the disk.  This is especially true of 3-D ghosting, a common problem that can usually be eliminated by just increasing the contrast and brightness of the picture.

I saw this excellent film in 3-D in 1954, so I've been waiting anxiously for the 3-D Blu-ray disk to arrive.  It came today and I was very disappointed, because there was no sound.  There was sound in the disk menu, and there was sound in the documentary and trailer under special features, but when the movie plays there is no sound at all.  I'm sure it's not my equipment, because I don't have a problem with the sound on any other 3-D Blu-ray disk.  And, the disk itself was clean and free of scratches, so it was apparently manufactured with no sound on the disk. I wonder if I was sent the only disk with this problem, or if many of them were accidentally made with no sound. I've already packaged the disk for return to Amazon, requesting a replacement. And, I'm going to be very unhappy if the replacement disk has the same problem.  As for the movie itself, it is a true classic, having been directed by the great Hitchcock. And, it had a terrific cast, which included the beautiful Grace Kelly, so what more could you want. There is no need to go into the plot, as many others have already covered that. I watched the movie as a silent film, because I wanted to see it in 3-D again after more than half a century. In terms of quality, the restored image was clean and free of scratches, and the color was bright without any noticeable fade or color shift. However, there was much more grain than I expected. The resolution of 35mm Technicolor prints from 1954 is usually better than 1080p, but this transfer looks grainy, like it was made from a 16mm print.  To be fair, this film was not made in Technicolor, it was made in inferior Warnercolor, so I'm going to blame the graininess on the Warnercolor process. I give the film itself four stars, and I give it four stars for the effective use of stereoscopic photography.  I also give the over all restoration four stars, but I can only give the picture quality three stars, because of the grain. Finally, I give the sound zero stars, because there was no sound on my disk.",1349827200,,2699,4.485714285714286
770540,5,6304039530,"This is a real treat for any movie buff and an absolute thrill for Hitchcock fans, because the 3D version has been seen by very few people.  By the time the film was released in 1954, 3D had become unpopular so the studio decided to distribute it almost exclusively in 2D.  In the ensuing half century, it showed up in 3D in a few film festivals and the buzz was that the movie was a totally different movie in 3D.  (It is.)

So this is almost the first chance we've all had to see this in the form Hitchcock intended.  It's really a major event.  Like a lost painting of Da Vinci's or something like that.  ""Found footage"" of a different kind.

I never understood why Hitchcock chose this stage play, which he essentially filmed as a stage play, to be his 3D opus.  Now I see why.  Like Hitchcock's other stagey film, ""Rope,"" almost all of the action takes place in one room and not a particularly large room at that.  But, in 3D you feel like you're sitting in the room as kind of an unseen guest and the effect is disconcertingly voyeuristic.

I hadn't expected much from this BluRay release because the movie is almost 60 years old.  But the restoration is fabulous and though Hitchcock used a lot of restraint in using 3D to throw things out of the screen, the depth is excellent...  almost on a par with the effect you get in today's 3D blockbusters.  There is one startling effect, during the opening credits, where the words ""Directed by Alfred Hitchcock"" pop out of the screen and seem to float 3 feet in front of the TV.  So the technical firepower was there, Hitchcock just used it judiciously.

I can't wait to see ""House of Wax"" and all the other old 3D films.  I understand there are 50 of them and I want them all!",1349827200,5,1729,4.333333333333333

The transfer is excellent and the 3D effects rival and maybe even surpass the current crop of 3D films available. Hitchcock was the master, even in his use of the 3D medium. However, on the 3D Blu-Ray disk I received from Amazon, the featurette ""A Short History of 3D"" was not included on the disk. Disappointed. Not too sure if some of the disks have this short on them and some do not or if they all do not have it.

3D enthusiasts looking for a lot of pop-out-of-the-screen effects will be mostly disappointed; there are a couple of scenes that feature this, but the effect is mostly used here to give a sense of depth. When viewing the film in 2D, you feel like you're merely watching people in a London flat. In 3D, you feel like you're actually in the room with them, a voyeur hiding behind a row of liquor bottles on a table, or a desk, or a chair. It's really amazing what Hitchcock did here with 3D, and it's nice to finally see this film in the way it was originally intended to be seen.

Although the 3D effects on this Blu-ray disc do not come without issues such as some ghosting, the problems do not overshadow the film's full impact. This is a must-have for Hitchcock fans, especially those with 3D TVs or 3D projectors. For those who haven't made the 3D jump, the disc also allows the film to be viewed in 2D.

Dial M in 3D is a textbook example of how 3D films should be made. Hitchcock established himself as a cinematic master with the 1930 ""Juno and the Paycock,"" his second sound movie, where most of the action takes place within one room. Using a similar technique refined by two decades of experience, the Dial M camera voyeuristically lurks behind lamps, chairs and whiskey glasses, witnessing what should be the near-perfect crime. All of this works well in 2D, but becomes a new cinematic experience with the addition of depth. Hitchcock uses the limitations of the one-room setting to dramatic advantage, heightening the tension by pulling the viewer into the action. The film has been perfectly restored, with stunningly beautiful color and accurate stereo imaging. Kudos to Warner Brothers for taking on this ambitious project!",1347062400,4,1097,4.994535519125683

Alfred Hitchcock has made some of the best suspense movies out there. This is no cheesy movie from the 50's. The acting and quality are good. There was a movie similar called ""A Perfect Murder with Michael Douglas and Gwyenth Paltrow that was made in the late 1990's.

770620,5,6304039530,"This is a fascinating movie in several ways. It's a good story, well and entertainingly told by Hitchcock. Since it's basically a play set in one room and Hitch doesn't attempt to expand it very much, he needs to call on all his directorial skills to stop it becoming tedious to watch. His use of the cameras, pacing and interesting angles keeps the viewer from being bored and the actors are very easy to look at as well.

Next, Hitch and the actors work well together to create different moods. All of them at various times have our sympathy and all of them display unlikeable characteristics as well. It's done so cleverly that you don't realize until afterwards that your own reactions have changed constantly through the film. Milland is a top athlete, a sponger, a cuckolded husband, an unfaithful blackguard, a cunning schemer and blackmailer, an unlucky victim of circumstance, a brilliant improvisor, a dastardly liar and finally, believe it or not, a good loser! I can think of no other director capable of creating such an array of aspects to one character and yet have the character seem perfectly consistent throughout. Grace Kelly is more sympathetically handled and it's easy to overlook her willingness to deceive her husband, but Robert Cummings plays the lover who returns to pick up the dalliance where he left off as an unlikeable lothario and this puts Kelly's behavior in its proper perspective.

There is also the fascination of watching the acting conventions of the day, when 'naturalistic' acting wasn't in vogue. It looks almost as dated as the ""Woe is me"", hand on brow emoting of silent movies. It doesn't suffer in this respect- the play/movie was written for that syle of performance and understated acting would look bland and boring.

The twist at the end is one of the best in movies and the excellent John Williams, in his finest role, does a wonderful job of setting it up. A very good film, not perhaps a tour-de-force as are some of Hitchcock's movies, but in its way every bit as effective.",1343001600,,2029,4.791428571428572

He discovered she's really in love with mystery writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). So he traps an old school mate gone bad into doing the job for him. He's planned it out very carefully, the perfect murder.

Sure. The minute anyone asserts he's planned the perfect murder, you know his hubris will do him in if nothing else does.

Needless to say, it does not go as planned. In fact, Margot successfully defends herself and the attacker ends up dead. So thinking on his feet (the guy is pretty clever), Tony changes the plan. And very nearly gets away with it. Very nearly indeed.

I was watching the special features, and the one thing I did not agree on was that we, the audience, were supposed to root for the husband. At least for certain parts of the story. Bob Cummings as the boyfriend was not the most interesting guy ever, nor the most handsome, but I got the impression that he loved Margot a lot more and was a lot kinder to her than the husband, and that was enough for me.

Almost every scene takes place in the couple's London apartment. It wouldn't work for some movies but it suits this one perfectly. Frequent Hitchcock leading lady, Grace Kelly is ideally cast as the aloof but sexy would-be victim. Ray Milland is at his best as the smooth as silk, but villianous leading man. Robert Cummings (best known for tv's Love that Bob), proves to be just as capable at drama as comedy, as Kelly's charming American lover. This is a must see for any Hitchcock fan.

When the film opens you'll probably think how dated it looks and how stilted the dialog is.  Kelly speaks so beautifully but so deliberately it's almost annoying.

Hitchcock was known for his warped sense of humor and as a viewer you'll enjoy the twists in the plot and how Hitchcock can make you feel worried for both the killer and the scheming husband when you shouldn't feel sympathy for either. These are two characters that do not deserve our sympathy. And just when you think you know what is happening, the story goes in an entirely different direction...and then twists again. It's really great fun.

Be sure to watch the extra, the ""Making of Dial M for Murder"" where other directors give you their take on the film and Hitchcock.  Peter Bogdanovitch and M. Night Shyamalan have some interesting and funny things to say as they show you scenes from the movie and talk about their take on the scenes. Both have a special fondness for Hitchock but it's Shyamalan who especially gets a kick out of Hitchock and how he ends the film with Ray Milland's sophisticated character offering everyone, including the chief inspector,  a cocktail before the police come for the final arrest.  -Brenda Pizzo, Boston",1307923200,,1612,4.525773195876289

770682,5,6304039530,"After watching many of Hitchcock's early films (The Lodger, Strangers on a Train, etc.) I've come to truly appreciate his later works that many viewers are very familiar with:  Dial M for Murder (as well as Rear Window) are his best suspense thrillers from the mid-1950s.

Speaking of Hollywood, they seem to have lost their step:  where is the next Hitchcock, where are the suspense thrillers that amazed and astounded the audiences of a bygone era?

Hitchcock took a great play of the time and rather than ""open"" it, he shot it, as only Hitchcock could do.  There was the 3D craze at the time (and you thought it was only recently, huh?) and so he shot a lot of the film with that in mind.  The interposition of lamps, fences, people, scissors (!!) could also work in 3D as well as flat!

Ray Milland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Weekend/dp/B0000549B1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Weekend</a>) plays the tennis pro, retired, who discovered that his wife (the amazingly gorgeous Grace Kelly in her first Hitchcock film -- later appearances in Rear Window and To Catch a Thief) plays the cheating wife.

It's interesting that Grace is not in a lot of scenes.  In fact she plays second fiddle to the plot:  an amazing play on action and suspense.

Hitch sets up the audience -- the suave, rich man who has evil in his heart, finds a man to blackmail and use him as the murder weapon (the slimy sneak Anthony Dawson and goes step by step through the process, walking him around the room, telling him exactly what to do and how to do it.  Milland's character exudes this brilliance and competence -- what could possibly go wrong?  It all goes off without a hitch at 11:03 pm.

What, you didn't check your watch?

Robert Cummings&nbsp;] is the visiting American writer -- not a lot to love about this guy although his ability to figure out that there is no such thing as a perfect murder and even goes so far as to explain to Milland's character the very way he actually attempted the deed is amazing. ""Who would believe a crazy story like that?  Looks good on paper!""  As if!

I love how everything goes wrong with the killer, with the strategically placed scissors (the murderer dies most operatically!) the stopped watch, etc., and Milland has to rewind and adapt to the new situation -- getting his wife thrown in prison to be executed sounds like a great way to get out of it!

Brilliantly filmed in high saturated color, the cinematography with the pans and the minimalist shots & camera angles and the fact that it was all shot pretty much in one room is amazing to watch.

The DVD Extras are great, too.  There's an interview with M. Night Shyamalan&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unbreakable-Two-Disc-Vista-Series/dp/B00003CXQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unbreakable (Two-Disc Vista Series)</a>&nbsp;where he describes Dial M and talks about how these cinematic techniques have affected his own film-making.  Hitchcock's daughter Patricia makes an appearance in the ""making of"" and the brief history of 3D film-making rounds out the DVD.

The audience set-up and suspending the resolution of the crime and the smooth sleuthing of John Williams' character make this movie the top Hitchcock film for me.  Well done!

770684,5,6304039530,"Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954)

(Released: 2004 by Warner Home Video)
Another (Not so long, this time!) DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

""When the batteries are running dry, take a hit play and shoot it.""

 With his typical understatement, director Alfred Hitchcock describes his efforts on another masterpiece, ""Dial M for Murder"", adapted from a famous stage play by author Fredrick Knott.

In it, husband Ray Milland plots the murder of wife Grace Kelly - who is having an affair with American mystery writer Robert Cummings.

Milland meticulously plans his crime to the finest detail, only to find that the best laid plans of mice and Millands often go astray.  No more, lest we venture into ""Spoiler Territory"".

Despite the ""star power"" of its leads, the film is stolen by John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard, who cracks the case almost in the manner of a ""British Columbo"".  Williams, who made a career of playing ""stuffy old Englishmen"", was something of a regular on the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS television program - appearing in 10 episodes of the show!

In an ironic casting twist, Williams went from trapping a ""wife murderer"", to planning such a murder himself in the HITCHCOCK PRESENTS episode ""The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater"" (1957).  There, it is WILLIAMS' character who works out every deadly detail and somewhat ineptly attempts to carry out his scheme - with the assistance and urging of an attractive ""island girl"" who is the product of his daydreams.

Given the involvement of John Williams, and the fact that it was produced a scant three years after ""Dial M for Murder"", I would strongly suspect that ""The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater"" was in some way inspired by the film.

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

If there were a ""CON"" to list, it would have to be that the Extra Features are adequate, but not plentiful, given this is a famous film by a legendary director.

Most notably, there is NO COMMENTARY TRACK to accompany this film!  Surely, there are film historians and Hitchcock scholars capable of providing such a track.

The PROS:

The Film:  Story, cast, and direction are all first rate.  Print quality seems fine for a film of its age.

Menu Navigation:  Menus are attractive and easy to navigate, with the ""added fun"" of depicting the ""cursor"", used to select the various options, as a PAIR OF SCISSORS!  Those familiar with the film cannot help but smile at this little touch.

Extra Features:

""Hitchcock and Dial M"" (Runs 21:33).

A ""making of"" documentary, that nicely covers the film, given the lack of a true commentary track.  Participants include: Peter Bogdonovich, M. Night Shyamalan, Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter), Robert Osborne, Nat Benchley, Richard Franklin, and Richard Schickel.  Oddly, it is the relative ""youngster"" Shyamalan who makes the most interesting and enthusiastic comments of the group.

""3D: A Brief History"" (Runs 7:06).

To compete with the emerging medium of television, the makers and distributors of theatrical features offered color, widescreen/Cinemascope... and for a brief time in the mid-fifties ""Three Dimensional Films"".

Unbeknownst to me until viewing this feature, ""Dial M for Murder"" WAS released as a 3D film!

Watching the film WITH this knowledge, it becomes very clear.  ""Dial M for Murder"" is shot in an unusual way (...which I merely attributed to the directorial quirks of ""Hitchcock being Hitchcock""), where certain objects and characters exist in the EXTREME FOREGROUND, in comparison with the rest of the frame.

This technique is particularly apparent in the ""attempted murder of Grace Kelly"" scene.  Both Kelly's arm and the aforementioned ""pair of scissors"" are intentionally ""thrown back"" toward the audience to maximize the effect.  Again, I thought this was just the director's flair. It must have been great fun to see that way!

At the 54:05 point of the film's length of 1:45:16, there occurs an INTERMISSION - punctuated with the on-screen image of a TITLE CARD simply saying ""Intermission"".

I naturally thought that this was in keeping with ""Dial M for Murder's"" origins as a STAGE PLAY.  In fact, it was because the 3D effect required TWO PROJECTORS, playing two slightly different synched versions of the film - and that both projectors needed to be RELOADED at that point.  (Commonly, half a film would play on one projector and the other half would play on a second projector - but this process required both projectors to be ""in service"" at the same time!)

The 3D fad as a whole, its specific application to ""Dial M for Murder"", and the public's boredom with, and abandonment of, the craze and its requisite 3D Glasses are examined all in the space of a scant seven-plus minutes.

Participants in this feature include: Film historian: Robert Osborne, and Filmmakers: Joe Alves (Director of ""JAWS 3D""), Peter Bogdonovich, and Richard Franklin (Director of ""Psycho II"").

Theatrical Trailer for ""Dial M for Murder""

Golden Age Hollywood Movie Trailers were a unique art form all their own, and Warner Bros. made some of the best! One reason why was the melodramatic ""Voice of Warner Bros"" Robert C. Bruce.  Bruce carries some - but not all - of the load here.

Overall:

This is a great film with a good selection of Extra Features.  It is recommended for Hitchcock, murder, and suspense fans, and enthusiasts of the mid-fifties period.",1284940800,3,5421,4.976640711902114

770686,4,6304039530,"This is a typical story of a man planning, what he believes is the perfect murder of his wife.  It is incredible that in 1954, movie makers created such a thought provoking plot that would be copied by others many decades later.

Admittedly, the old style of acting is sometimes funny and quirky, with the fake kisses and talking to a person while your back is turned to them, but you simply can't ignore the clever techniques of shadows, lights, and various motifs at this early stage of cinema.

This is another master piece by Hitchcock that is worth watching and having.",1283817600,,574,4.607843137254902
770687,5,6304039530,"As an old man I can say that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors ever. As usual he only moves the camera, makes an edit, changes the point of view when he absolutely has to. That is not a stubborn laziness, but a clear understanding of what he wants on film and how to get it.
  His technique of the one room, character helping character come out, every prop important and all for the sake of the story is fantastic. There also is his laugh at humanity thinking it can get perfection, albeit a crime, when there ain't no such thing. He also makes his point that us stuffy folk like the British Detective have a knack for truth.
  We also see interplay with the reactions of players when they aren't speaking as important as the speeches.
  The set is a set up for all Hitchcock's fun. The acting is 50's, but mostly good 50's and good to look at to remember that there is more to mystery than action.",1283731200,,907,4.2748538011695905

770743,4,6304039530,"I wouldn't put this movie in the top drawer of Hitchcock's output but it's still well worth watching. With the DVD, the extra features are very illuminating and watching the analysis of people like Peter Bogdanovich deepens the viewer's understanding and enjoyment.

The movie is based on a successful play by Frederick Knott, one of those playwrights much celebrated in their own time and now mostly forgotten. Hitchcock's treatment is very theatrical. Almost all the action takes place in one room. But his camera angles and the way he switches focus from one character to the next is masterful.

SPOILERS AHEAD: Tony Wendice, an ex-tennis player, wants to get rid of his unfaithful wife. He hires an old university acquaintance with a seamy past to do the deed. But his perfect crime goes wrong and the murderer ends up murdered. Quick as a flash, Wendice frames his wife for the murder.

The performances are all excellent but Ray Milland as Wendice stands out. This is a superb depiction of an oily, comletely amoral yet charming man. It's part of Hitchcock's genius that the viewer actually sympathizes with him. Grace Kelley is gorgeous as the wife, although not required to act up a storm. Other great performances come from John Williams, the chief inspector, and Antony Dawson, the murderer turned victim.

There are parts of the plot which are totally unrealistic and it's hard to say anything deep is explored in this movie. Just watch it to enjoy a master at work, in full command of a superb cast.",1268438400,3,1511,4.844961240310077
770744,3,6304039530,"I'm surprised that this is getting so many high ratings.  It has never been considered one of Hitchcock's best films despite the minimal presence of Grace Kelly. Hitchcock was, in my opinion, the greatest filmmaker of all time, but his virtues were overwhelmingly visual, not verbal.  Of the dozens and dozens of famous scenes in his many movies, virtually all of them were focused on visual techniques.  The basic problem with DIAL M FOR MURDER is that it is almost all talk.  It is a stagey adaptation of a stage play that has few (though not none) Hitchcockian touches.  For the student of film, it is one of the least interesting of Hitchcock's films of the 1950s, especially given that the film is rarely seen in 3D, in which it was filmed.  I'm pretty certain that the 3D cameras along with the talk-talk-talk nature of the film it simply isn't compelling.

The fact is that most film viewers are focused merely on whether a story is interesting.  The performances of the actors are all good and the plot is fun, but as a Hitchcock film, it is one of his least interesting.  Over the years, I've seen nearly all of Hitchcock's movies 4 or 5 or even 6 times.  But I've barely been able to stand watching DIAL M FOR MURDER three times.  While I think Hitchcock may have made more out and out masterpieces than any director who has ever lived, and certainly more than any director who worked primarily in Hollywood, he also made a surprising number of weak films, usually when he ceased to be interesting in a project after it began.  This film doesn't belong to the bottom tier of films with true clunkers like UNDER CAPRICORN and JAMAICA INN, but it in is in the next batch.  The screenplay makes it perhaps more entertaining than another stagey film, ROPE, but the technical challenges of that other film at least make it more interesting from a technical standpoint.  Apart from the 3D effects in this film (which unfortunately don't work for us), there is simply not much interesting here.

By the way, I've not heard precisely how they get the print for this version of the film.  3D films were created by the use of two parallel cameras.  My guess is that they simply take the film from one of the two cameras and use that for the 2D print that we see now.  Still, of the sixty odd Hitchcock films that I have seen, I would place this somewhere between 40 and 50 on the list in the order of my preference.  It isn't a bad film; it simply isn't representative of the Master at his best.",1267228800,5,2495,4.480088495575221

770747,5,6304039530,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"" is one of his best films. Most of the movie takes place in a single room, but it remarkably doesn't feel limited or claustrophobic. Based on a screenplay of the same name, by Frederick Knott, this thriller is a brilliantly directed suspense thriller. Hitchcock's films were generally suspense thrillers rather than mystery thrillers, the difference being that in a suspense thriller we might know who has done what, or who is going to do what, but the structure of the film is always suspending the inevitable. And it is this quality that often separates Hitchcock from other directors. In this case we have a murder that is about to take place, and we wonder how it is all going to take place, and how events might be displaced by events as mishaps or variables come into play. As the novelist in the movie mentions, there is never a perfect murder because there is always something that is overlooked by the murderer, and this is what sets up the intriguing sequence of events that are to take place.

Interestingly, this film was filmed with the intention of showing it in 3-D, which was popular at the time, and this accounts for some fascinating spatial arrangements in the film. There is often a heightened sense of space (even without the 3-D) because of the way people or objects have been arranged in the camera's frame. Often people are seen just beyond an arrangement or group of objects  in the foreground which are seen from waist level or lower. There is also a sequence whereby the camera angle is held from above the height of an imaginary roof looking down on the actors. This was a clever way for Hitchcock to expand the boundaries of room as well as to create the sense of another person peering in to the proceedings unbeknownst to the characters. The audience becomes the witness, which is to say, the plotter will not get away with murder. He is like a rat in a maze, and we see everything, so it is just a matter of watching how the suspense will play out.",1259020800,,2018,4.587257617728532
770748,5,6304039530,"This could be the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made. Ray Miland does a terrific job being the mastermind criminal. Even though his plans get a wrench thrown in them every time, he rolls with the punches thinking up an answer for everything down to the last detail. I would recommend this movie to anyone for the intrigue factor. Alfred Hitchcock was the best, why someone thinks they could re-create one of his movies to make it better (Psycho) are out of their ever lovin' minds. He is the master. Watch it with all the lights out and no interruptions for the full effect. Creepy !!",1249516800,,587,4.547169811320755
770749,5,6304039530,"Dial M For Murder takes place almost entirely within the confines of one room, breezes by in two acts, contains very little action, features only five characters of any real significance, and yet it feels absolutely epic. Its dialogue-saturated narrative ripples with tension, wit, and menace, every word of the script serving to propel, complicate, and enliven one of the most wonderful and quintessentially Hitchcockian plots you've ever seen. The story revolves around retired tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) as he attempts to murder his wealthy and unfaithful wife Margot (Grace Kelly. Be still, my beating heart!). A clever and calculating man, Wendice orchestrates a brilliant scheme that, if executed properly, will leave his wife dead and him with an airtight alibi. The plan goes off with exactly one hitch, but it's a pretty big one: Margot doesn't die. Not to be deterred, Wendice sets about turning the situation to his advantage.

I wouldn't want to give anything else away, so suffice to say that the fun of this movie is watching Wendice manipulate the police, Margot, and her lover Mark (Robert Cummings) into resolving the situation in his favor, all the while playing the concerned husband. He's a villain that's fun to root for; we hate his intentions but love his wit, his meticulous attention to detail, and his prodigious talent for improvisation. Squaring off against Wendice is the Columbo-like Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), whose talent for discovering the truth is as intuitive and uncanny as is Wendice's for concealing it.

Milland and Williams steal the show here. Their performances are understated but brilliant. Each man is dapper, witty, and charismatic, and they convey a charming sort of arrogance, an awareness of and admiration for their own cleverness. In their scenes together, they seem to talk over the heads of whoever else happens to be in the room, as if they're facing each other in a private game that nobody else is aware of. Except us, of course.

Hitchcock keeps the tension high, letting the labyrinthine plot strain against the edges of its claustrophobic setting, turning Wendice and Hubbard's conversations about extra latchkeys and missing attach cases play like high drama. Classic.",1247011200,5,2251,5.178571428571429

770825,5,6304039530,"Hitchcock's immaculate rendering of the stage thriller is one of that rare breed: the underrated classic.  Without significantly altering the action by ""opening it up"", Hitchcock still creates something thrillingly cinematic.  This has to be one of the finest stage adaptations ever.  It may be one of the best mysteries ever made as well.  Indeed, it's amazing how the play's text is riveting even when it's art-less carrying on about latch-keys and the specifics of the planned murder.  (This contradicts Chandler's otherwise strong thesis in his essay The Simple Art of Murder.  These details aren't supposed to hold our interest once we know the story's outcome, but they do.)

Much of how this is achieved is through the stellar cast particularly Ray Milland who turns in one of the great Hitchcock performances.  As we watch him cover-up his crimes and avoid detection, he's like a dapper Norman Bates.  He's really a psychopath, but completely charming and we're thankfully spared any insights into his character or motivation.  His scene with Anthony Dawson is mesmerizing and one of the best in all Hitchcock.  (Right up there with Janet Leigh in Anthony Perkins's parlor which it resembles.)  Dawson is also superb.

Grace Kelly is terrific in the first half if a little wan in the later scenes.  (This could have allowed Hitchcock a chance to examine a distaff take on his wronged man theme, but by that point we need to wrap things up.)  The much-maligned Bob Cummings has some effective bits at the start, even if he does seem like he's playing Harold Hill towards the end.  John Williams is marvelous, but seems a bit stagy compared to Milland's effortless command of the screen.  Very good score runs throughout.

There are good insights in the accompanying documentary from Peter Bogdonovich and M. Night Shyamalan who comes across as an eager Hitch fanboy.  (Richard Schickel trying to invoke a class-conscious reading of the hero is silly and clearly something he's making up on the spot.)",1228003200,,2007,4.990963855421687

But, within 10 minutes of the opening, we have Milland ""on a pulpit"" with his annoying voice droning on and on to a sleazy college acquaintance of how the latter is to commit the crime. Later, we have the equally annoying voice of ""Sherlock Holmes"" filling the airwaves, following the botched murder. Cummings is acceptable and Kelly is first rate, per usual. But,to me it's nothing but gab,gab,gab, with all of the ""action"" confined to one room. Additionally  , one has to be ever alert to the latch key problem, lest the viewer becomes totally confused.

770832,4,6304039530,"Hitchcock is a director you can always rely on to give you something thought provoking.  A man concocts a flawless plan to have his cheating wife murdered.  However when the plan doesn't go exactly according to plan, he is forced to improvise and cover his tracks.  It's very fun to try and catch the mistake he's made and see if he did in fact cover up everything.  When an inspector gets involved, trying to piece together how the murder went down, things get really interesting.

Based on the play by Frederick Knott, it is acted out very much in stage fashion.  There is a very minimal amount of sets and characters, and a considerable amount of dialogue.  But if you pay close attention, you get sucked in by the events and the suspense.

Ray Milland is excellent as the husband who is trying to off his wife.  If it wasn't for him, the movie would fall apart.  Grace Kelly also does her role justice, however I prefered her in Rear Window.  John Williams also plays a great supporting role as the Inspector.  I have only seen bits and pieces of the remake A Perfect Murder, but after watching this, I would never want to see it, as I know Michael Douglas and Gweneth Paltrow would not compare.

The ending is both satisfactory, and yet strange.  A great conclusion, but their reactions are a bit odd.  It could have used a little something more dramatic.  But it doesn't ruin it for me, it's still a fantastic suspense story.  Keep your eyes peeled for what may be Hitchcock's briefest and most subtle cameos yet.",1196553600,2,1519,4.525735294117647

So why would one ex-tennis bum, Tony (play be Ray Milland), who in the course of his professional tennis career probably had more love affairs at the courts with an off-hand wealthy matron or two than one can shake a stick at, take umbrage when his wealthy wife, Margot (played by Grace Kelly), had a little dalliance of her own. A dalliance with an off-hand smart crime novel writer a la Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler, Mark (played by Robert Cummings), to boot just in order to muddy up the waters.

Well that is the plot line here in the film under review, Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder, as an ill-disposed hubby Tony finds out about the little illicit tryst and plots revenge, revenge big time. Oh no, not like some smart guy, tennis bum or not, would do by raking dear wifey through the 1950s divorce courts with good old boy Mark as correspondent. No he had to go for the big M, Mas in murder. So naturally he needed to over-plan some nefarious plot by bringing a ne'er do well (English version, naturally) in to bungle the damn thing. Bungle it big time as Margot wound up killing said unjust assassin in self-defense.

But that little turn of events became our boy Tony's opening as he framed said wifey big time, or almost. The line-up of circumstantial he led the peelers to was just too perfect, almost. On the evidence even a half-baked lawyer should have been able to get Margot out of a murder one charge and a hard look at the gallows but it took old Mark and his dime store crime investigative skills to set things right in the end.

Note: Forget all that stuff about evidence, about wifely adulterous affairs, about a cad named Tony, and a house-wreaker named Mark. Why on this good green earth would anyone in their right minds touch one hair on the head of one Grace Kelly. I was too young to appreciate her beauty when I was kid as I was strictly into women (oops, girls) with stick shapes and winsome toothy smiles but some women in this world are just not built to face the cruel executioner's noose. I probably just balled all of this up so let me put it this way as I have on other occasions when dealing with Grace Kelly films. One story had it that her husband, Prince Rainer of Monaco, a man not known to show much public emotion, openly wept at her funeral.  Now I know why.",1193702400,,2351,4.397701149425288

The mystery here is pretty good with enough clever twists.  Ray Milland is at the top of his game as the nefarious husband plotting his wife's murder.  Grace Kelly effortlessly shines as Milland's intended victim.  Alas, I have to say that the fault lies in the direction.  It seems that Hitchcock instead of directing the film is a slave to the ""groundbreaking"" 3-D technology and lets it direct him.  The film stops at certain points to a resounding thud so that we can marvel at the sight of a tray of teacups coming at us.  If Hitchcock trusted his instincts instead of being trapped by this gimmick technology maybe ""Dial M for Murder"" would have been a better film.  The only films that I can think of made in 3-D that transcended the technology are ""Hondo"" and ""House of Wax"".

770916,4,6304039530,"The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott ""Dial M for Murder"" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film ""A Perfect Murder"" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony  and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow.

Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.

As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call ""Dial M for Murder"" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.",1183507200,2,2528,4.727891156462585

770921,4,6304039530,"Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely wife (Grace Kelly) in order to support his flagging bank balance...

His cause is ""justified"" by the fact that his wife is guilty of cheating on him...

Milland develops a carefully constructed murder plan, contacting Captain Lesgate (John Williams), an old college classmate operating illegal ventures, to whom he outlines his murder scheme and then blackmails into carrying it out...

The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...

The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...

Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingnue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her...

Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table...

John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...

Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...

The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...

Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...

'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...

'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie & precarious...

""Dial M for Murder"" is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite must-see!",1167091200,2,4058,4.958762886597938
770922,4,6304039530,"First of all about the movie itself: this is good, if not great, Hitchcock. It's very entertaining if a bit stage bound, and the performances are uniformly fine.

That out of the way I thought I'd expand on the 3D aspect. I actually saw the 3D version about 25 years ago or so at a Hollywood theater on the Strip. It was part of a double feature with ""Strangers on a Train"" (there is a connection as it has been noted that the Ray Milland character in ""Dial"", a tennis pro, could have been the Farley Granger character in ""Strangers"").

I recall reading that when one reason Hitch shot the film in 3D was to bring out the realism of the stage play. This is evident in many scenes in the way objects are juxtaposed with the actors, such as lamps and furniture, as well as distances (seeing into the bedroom beyond the living room). In other words, the 3D served the story rather than the other way around.

But there were at least two showcase scenes where the 3D was key. The first was when the Grace Kelly character is being assaulted and is frantically waving her hand behind her (ostensibly to get the scissors). In 3D her hand was right in front of our faces, and we are basically helpless to assist. The second, while not as dynamic, is where the inspector presents the latch key, directly to the viewer.

As for the glasses, they were polarized--they did not have the red/blue lenses that people associate with 3D. The film was photographed using a process where to view it you wore what were like lightly shaded sun glasses (I think I still have them in a box somewhere), and therefore, with the color intact, it didn't detract from the film.

Though it lacked the sensational aspect of films like ""House of Wax"", the 3D was nevertheless effective in its subtlety, and I wish Warner could release a 3D version on DVD. I feel fortunate to have seen ""Dial M for Murder"" in 3D, and hope we all get the opportunity to see it in the future.",1159747200,6,1942,4.41340782122905

Several delicious plot twists.",1156809600,2,329,4.7894736842105265
770982,5,6304039530,"Let's forget for a moment that Alfred Hitchcock was the best director at creating and sustaining gut wrenching suspense. That will always be his trademark; the ability to milk the tension of a scene to the very last drop.

The Master of Suspense? It's just too easy to classify him as this suspense thriller hack and dismiss his many virtuoso talents.

What I'd like to remember Mr. Hitchcock for is his ingenious ability to create a sense of pathos & psychosis in most of his main protagonists and villains; meanwhile having us relate to them in their immoral behaviors. Deftly, Mr. Hitchcock uses this transference (from screen character to viewer) so we can relate and identify directly to their situations and motivations however moral or immoral.

In Dial M for Murder, we can't help but to go against our own moral judgement and wish that the murder of Grace Kelly's character goes as planned by her husband. In the film's expository, a murder plan is hatched. Mr. Hitchcock masterfully sets up this scene with a changing of the point of view in the story and main characters. We are soon aware that the Ray Milland character is the central figure and he has the central motivation throughout the film. (although this changes later in the story)

What's haunting and eerie about this film's premise is Hitchcock's use of the point of view throughout the film. We see the film through Milland's eyes and there are many POV shots to prove it.

With a bit of reservation, when the dramatic first half climax arrives we hope that the hired killer stays long enough to carry off his execution of the Grace Kelly character. The reason is because Hitchcock has conditioned our response with tension and suspense in this highly dramatic situation. We see Milland's watch has stopped, a restless hired killer ready to abort, a man taking up precious time on a pay phone, and the extreme close up of the dial number. In ""western"" film narrative with all of these suspense elements inter cut together we expect a big payoff. And the audience wants to see this murder carried out.

Variations of this theme were played out beautifully in Robert De Niro's, Travis Bickle character at the ending climax of Taxi Driver and Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal character in The Silence of the Lambs. (When Hannibal escapes that weird detainment configuration and Travis shoots down the pimps we are rooting for murder)

This is something Mr. Hitchcock knew way ahead of its time and it's a very odd dynamic; a compelling reality in the audience to movie-story relationship.",1147392000,3,2552,4.826086956521739
770983,4,6304039530,"Although Hitchcock considered this film one of his lesser efforts, DIAL M FOR MURDER (based on the hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott) contains enough thrills and twists to keep fans happy, and Hitchcock's touch is evident in every scene.

Margot Wendice (Grace Kelly) seems to have the perfect marriage with her tennis champion husband Tony (Ray Milland).  But we soon learn that Margot has another man on the side, Mark Halliday (Bob Cummings).  When Tony discovers the affair, he plots the death of Margot at the hands of a 'burglar'.  But the plan goes awry when Margot manages to free herself and kills her assailant.  Tony accuses his bewildered wife of murder and it's up to the resourceful Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to solve the case and prove Margot's innocence.

While the film doesn't have the same scope or impact as earlier films like ""Shadow of a Doubt"" or ""Notorious"", DIAL M FOR MURDER is the perfect film version of the Knott play.  Hitchcock wisely did not open up the play too much, instead keeping the action almost exclusively in the Wendice apartment.  Rather than creating a claustrophobic feeling, innovative camera angles and blocking create a ""play-like"" atmosphere without the cramped confines of the space becoming an issue.  The performances are fine.  Ray Milland delivers one of his finest portrayals, and gives the character of Tony a softness and vulnerability that other actors might not have tapped into.  In her first Hitchcock film, Grace Kelly is amazing as the targeted wife, looking scrumptious in some lovely gowns.  Bob Cummings tries to give the one-dimensional role of Mark some life but the viewer is always more taken with Milland and Kelly.  The supporting players John Williams and Anthony Dawson (as the ill-fated victim) both deliver handsomely.  Originally filmed and screened in 3-D (and having the distinction of being Hitch's first colour movie), DIAL M FOR MURDER was a sound critical and financial success and remains an enjoyable and entertaining tale from Hitchcock's gallery of films.",1144195200,3,2053,5.08955223880597

770987,4,6304039530,"Hitchcock builds a whole crime story and its suspense on one single element : the brand new latch keys that appeared after the second world war that, as an inspector says, all look alike. The suspense is not that of discovering who the criminal or murderer is. We know that from the very start. There is a big surprise about who is killed but that is only a detail on the road to perfection that cannot be reached by an amateur criminal. The suspense is how is he going to go through, what new invention and lie is he going to invent to cover up his tracks and to push the inspector's attacks away. He is a great talker and a very good liar, so we do discover how his mind works full time on inventing new stories and explanations that are all false but cannot be proved so. But this film is not one of the best by Hitchcock because the sentimental and dramatic content is rather shallow : a British gigolo husband and a British rich wife, plus an American lover for the wife : British nostalgia and American bravado for the American public, British naiveness and American rudeness for the British audience. Hitchcock was always bifacial and bifocal to satisfy his two main English speaking audiences. That menage--trois situationcan only provoke the husband into getting rid of the wife and grabbing her money. That is banal and trite. This situation is in no way thickened or deepened by further considerations or developments. That leads to a dead end, which is kind of normal for a crime story, in which everyone, including the police, knows the truth but cannot do anything, even if that knowledge is enough to save the wife's life who was programmed to be executed for the murder of the ancillary murderer of the tale. I guess we are before the banning of the death penalty in Great Britain. So the end is also particularly sick if not even sickening : a murderer can go through an investigation unharmed for lack of hard evidence, even if we can imagine he is going to lose the wife (who no longer is HIS wife in HER mind) and her money in a subsequent divorce. Rather entertaining, and be sure Alfred Hitchcock managed to set his mug in one or two frames : look for him having some side-kicks in his own film.

Grace Kelly was Hitchcock's ideal woman.  In this outing she plays a woman having an affair (Hitchcock favorite Robert Cummings).  Her husband (Ray Milland) is a professional tennis player but not a top player (and in those days only the top players made more than an existence.)  As she has all the money, her husband decides that his only option is to have her killed.

The murder attempt fails and the hired killer is killed.  The remaining movie is the unraveling of the murder attempt.  The Frederick Knott adapted the screenplay from his hit play.  The atmosphere of the play is perfect for Hitchcock.  You virtually never leave the apartment. Hitchcock is in his element at turning the claustrophobic feeling of a closed set into tension.

This was Grace's year with her Oscar winning performance in The Country Girl and another Hitchcock triumph in Rear Window.  With her outstanding performance here, she definitely was the star of the year.

The film originally had sequences filmed in 3-D but the DVD is all 2-D.  Therefore, sometimes the action might look a little off but this is usually for a 3-D effect.

770989,5,6304039530,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 color movie Dial M for Murder is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. After 51 years Dial M for Murder still shines with class and great British style that never grows old. The principals in the movie are Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) and Grace Kelly (Margot Wendice), Robert Cummings is Mark Halliday the outside love interest. John Williams is excellent as the dapper, low keyed Chief Inspector Hubbard. The casting for this movie is just perfect.

Ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice is unhappy to find himself in the middle of a love triangle. He is not so concerned about his wife's extramarital affair, as much as he is concerned about loosing a wealthy wife and her money. By chance he sees and recognizes old class mate, Charles Swann from his college days. He realizes that Swann may be the answer to his money and philandering wife troubles. Ray Milland oozes charm and sometimes menace as his Tony Wendice character purposefully manipulates those around him to become part of his diabolical scheme for the perfect crime. Wendice's smile never reaches his eyes, it lets you know that he will allow nothing to stop his plans. However, it is Anthony Dawson as Charles Swann who holds your attention the whole time he is on the screen. Dawson has the perfect slightly swarmy look for this role as a seasoned petty con man who finds himself caught up in a game he never expected to play. His eyes dart about the room as if trying to find a way out, after he is blackmailed to commit murder. He soon understands that he must comply with Wendice's wishes. But the best laid plans often go bad, and although Wendice falters, he is not deterred. He simply moves on to an alternate plan. Watch Grace Kelly as she goes from being a cool, society housewife Margo Wendice to a hopeless woman who is surprised and confused to find herself falsely accused of murder. Her only hope for freedom is a latchkey.

This is the kind of movie that has you holding your breath. Most of the action takes place in one room and the camera works magic with its corner and overhead shots. There are close ups of inanimate objects that are integral to the plot.

This movie is definitely a must-have for your vintage movie collection.

Her lover, Mark Halliday, arrives to visit Margot and Tony in London. But Tony can't go out with them because of extra work. This work is to meet the seller of an automobile, but really to plan the murder of his wife. The long dialogue sets the background and the plan for murder. [This all seems very like a stage play.] Tony, a tennis star, met and married Margot, a wealthy heiress. But as Tony aged and found a new career, Margot seems to be thinking of leaving him and taking her money. Mark is a writer of mystery novels, and he says the ""perfect murder"" is impossible in real life. [Some may question this assumption.]

The suspense builds because Tony's watch has stopped. Finally the telephone rings, and ""Fisher"" tries to kill Margot. But Margot manages to stab ""Fisher"" and it is the attacker who is killed. Tony returns alone; his plan has failed because reality is not easily controlled. But clever Tony improvises another plan to accomplish his end! These clues are followed up by the police, who also noted the condition of the dead man's shoes. Suspicion falls on Margot. She is tried and convicted of murder. [Note how they economize on the trial. The voice and facial expressions are an old technique from the silent film days.]

Mark Halliday shows up with his explanation of how the murder occurred, and tries to convince Tony to confess to the very plan that we know happened! The police inspector shows up to question Tony about the extra money that Tony has been spending; there was a local robbery. [Note how closely they are watching him!] Mark finds the case with money, and calls the inspector. More conversation follows to carry the story forward. Finally the trick of the police traps Tony when he enters his apartment. Justice triumphs in the end. [Note the subtle criticism of sports stars and wealthy heiresses.]

771087,5,6304039530,"I've always thought Ray Milland was a fine actor, even though his choice of roles could, generously, be called eclectic; which is probably why we can enjoy him in this production, as well as such diverse offerings as the Noir Classic ""The Big clock,"" ""Lost Weekend,"" for which he deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of a raging alcoholic, as well as ""The Man With X-Ray Eyes,"" and... ""The Thing With Two Heads!"" But for me, the part of ""Tony Wendice"" in Hitchcock's ""Dial M For Murder"" is the quintessential Milland role, suave, debonair, urbane, and utterly, ruthlessly, murderously, charming!

Frederick Knott, adapting his own stage production, wrote the screenplay, and Hitchcock wisely chose to film the material ""straight,"" without opening it up too much, but with one startling exception, which I'll come to later. As befits a stage production, the vast majority of ""Dial M"" takes place in just one location, Tony and Margot Wendice's living room, located in a genteel suburb of 1950's London.

The plot is deceptively simple; Tony is a retired Tennis Pro, being more-or-less supported by his wife Margot, played by a luminous Grace Kelly in an early film role. Tony's career meant that he was away for extended periods of time, playing in various tournaments, and during one of his absences Margot fell head-over-heals in love with an American writer visiting London. That was a year ago, and since then Tony has cold-bloodedly plotted to kill his wife, all the while playing the part of the devoted husband. But after a chance encounter he decides to blackmail an old acquaintance, a vaguely seedy con-man and womanizer, into committing the crime for him by following Tony's plan to the letter, a plan he claims is the ""Perfect Murder.""

Oh but it were; the plan may well have been perfect, but its execution - sorry! - is anything but. In a superbly staged scene the murder is bungled, and Tony arrives home to his shocked and near hysterical wife, very much alive, and the dead body of her assailant stretched out on the living room floor. Now you can see the wheels turning as a desperate Tony has to come up with a ""Plan B"" on the fly, and with the police on their way. As I said earlier, this is the quintessential Milland, and he plays the part of Tony with such relish and aplomb, that before you know it, you find yourself rooting for the cad; he's still trying to kill-off his wife, and you can't help hoping he gets away with it... an amazing performance!!!

""Dial M"" has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films; he seems to excel when working under almost impossible, self-imposed, restrictions. For other examples see the superlative ""Rope"" with James Stewart, and what is probably the most extreme example, the magnificent ""Lifeboat"" with Tallulah Bankhead. Here, as in the other two examples, we have a nail-biting thriller set in just one location, although there are a couple of external shots and a very brief, heavily stylized, ""courtroom"" scene.

But what sets this film apart from every other Hitchcock production is that it was made in 3D, a decision that was, apparently, forced on the director by the studio to cash in on the briefly popular craze. I'm lucky enough to have seen ""Dial M"" in the theatre in 3D, and while the main use of the process was usually to generate a cheap scare or giggle for the audience, Hitch made it his own by employing it with subtly and care.

Unlike almost all other 3D films from that time there're no monsters shambling towards us, no spears, chairs, or flaming meteors bursting from the screen. As you watch the film ""flat"" you'll notice that the camera often moves around the room looking ""up"" at the cast, and there's invariably a piece of furniture, a dresser or a table with a vase on it for instance, between the actor and the audience. Watching the film in 3D is really quite amazing, by taking this subtle approach Hitch is able to put us right into the room with the cast, and I often found myself trying to look ""around"" the furniture at the characters!

The one scene where Hitch really lets rip with the technique is the famous murder scene, where Margot is reaching behind her for the pair of scissors - there's a representation of the scene on the DVD cover artwork - and her hand appears to be coming out of the screen at you! (It's a shame that a 3D version of this film hasn't been issued on DVD, I'm sure that it would fit on a dual layer disc.)

Grace Kelly does sterling work as the betrayed Margot, Anthony Dawson is effective as ""Swann"" the murderer, although Robert Cummings is unfortunately bland as Margot's boyfriend ""Mark."" The only other actor who really shines is John Williams as ""Chief Inspector Hubbard,"" who pays a visit to clear up a few details the following day. Williams' Hubbard is terribly ""British,"" does not suffer fools gladly, and instinctively knows that the initial story of a killer coming in through the garden windows is a lie. Just as in Milland's portrayal, you can see the gears turning as he reasons events through; rather like Sherlock Holmes he discards what cannot be, and then by a process of deduction and elimination, whatever is left, no matter how improbable it seems, has to be the truth!

As I've indicated already, the film belongs to Milland, and the final scene where Tony discovers that the game is most certainly up will leave you smiling and shaking your head at the sheer nerve of the character, as that ""murderous charm"" shines like a thousand suns!!! This is a perfect gem of a film, ""classic"" Hitchcock, and I would recommend it highly.",1129766400,3,5599,4.693482688391039
771088,5,6304039530,"I must be the last living American fan of Alfred Hitchcock movies to see DIAL M FOR MURDER. This thriller is based on the play by Frederick Knott, who also wrote the screenplay for Hitchcock. The movie stars Grace Kelly (Margot) who is married to Ray Milland (Tony, the ex-tennis player), along with Robert Cummings(Mark Halliday) who thinks that his recent affair with Margot is not known to Tony. Of course he is wrong as Tony vows revenge and plans the perfect murder of his wife. There are no perfect crimes, however-- at least not in the movies-- or we wouldn't have a film that runs for two hours. DIAL M FOR MURDER shows Mr. Hitchcock as his best as he leads the viewer down one labyrinth after another with much style and intelligence. The acting is fine, particularly that of John Williams who plays Chief Inspector Hubbard, who solves the crime as only a dry, detached British police officer can. Although Grace Kelly is billed as one of the stars, she spends a great deal of the movie time off camera on death row. I'm happy to announce that almost dying becomes her as she is just as refined and beautiful when she leaves the prison as before she went into it. About the only difference we notice is that she has gone from wearing a fur stole to a sensible (Republican?) brown cloth coat. I was reminded of how much we as movie lovers lost when Ms. Kelly abdicated her position as a Hollywood queen to become a princess of a region about the size of Central Park in New York City.

Query: Shouldn't Margot have been suspicious when Tony called her from his dinner appointment and didn't say anything into the telephone for several minutes while her assailant tried to strangle her? Shouldn't she have found his behavior strange at best and at worst damaging to his credibility?

At any rate, this movie-- in quite beautiful technicolor-- is entertainment at its very best.",1127952000,2,1884,4.604166666666667
771089,5,6304039530,"Scissors would only have scratched the back of Sheila's attacker when swung from the angle she was at.  It would have been better if a paper spike had been left on the desk, which would have got in deep enough at first for her to have pressed it home with a little subsequent twisting.  It would have been a believably lethal weapon, like an ice pick.  A shot or shots of Tony recklessly slamming bills and receipts down on it early in the film would have nicely foreshadowed coming events.

As for swapping Cummings and Milland, that's an adventurous thought that MIGHT have worked.  (But it's hard to see Cummings so convincingly twisting the arm of the hired killer he'd recruited.  Reviews rarely give adequate credit to this lengthy scene and the actor who played the killer, because it's not in the mainline of the plot, but it's a high point of the movie.)  It's too bad Hitch didn't shoot the film BOTH ways, and given us a film with two psychological viewing angles, not just 3D's two physical angles.

One additional cavil is that there was too little information given on the married life of Tony & Sheila.  What had so alienated Sheila from Tony that she'd begun an affair?  Why did the American version lack any mention (that I recall) of Sheila's considering a divorce--and what were her reasons for this?  Had Tony given her reasons to suspect he'd been unfaithful, perhaps before she decided to become adventurous too?  Etc. There should have been a scene where Sheila and Mark talked such things over, to give us more of a feel for the marriage's emotional context and historical background.  The film is a plot-driven puzzler that fails to involve the audience sufficiently because of its slighting of such matters.  (But it still rates five stars.)

A second adventurous change that might have improved the movie would have been to let the viewers see the would-be murderer entering the flat and then slipping the key back under the staircase carpet.  That way they'd be ""clued in"" to the central surprise-element in the plot, which normally is a big No-No.  But here it might have worked, because the complexity of the plot is too great for most viewers to make sense of after the fact.  Inspector Hubbard's explanation of the latchkey-switcheroo to Mark didn't really clear away the fog--most viewers were left more dazed than enlightened.  (And this may have been the reason the film wasn't quite the hit it should have been.  It didn't get enough word-of-mouth recommendations.)

I wonder if Hitch did shoot some just-in-case footage showing the door being opened and the key being replaced--in which case a version incorporating it could be included on the DVD; or the viewer could be given the option at the critical point to watch or not watch a ""giveaway"" scene, and the DVD software could then automatically splice it in.  Even if Hitch didn't shoot it, that scene could actually be shot today, in semi-darkness and from a distance (from the front doorway), showing only the back of an actor of about the same dimensions as the original actor, and it would be adequate.  I think most viewers would enjoy the movie more despite being ""in the know"" about the surprise ending.

Here's a wild idea: digitally edit the film to include the changes suggested above and re-release it as ""Dial 'N' for Murder""!  (N standing for New.) The viewer could chose to see either the old or new version (containing three scenes replacing old scenes).  In the new version the scene where the scissors are placed on the desk would be cut, and the scissors on the desk in subsequent scenes would be digitally erased, while a paper spike would be superimposed.  The hard part would be to digitally reanimate Mark & Margot talking for half a minute (extending their conversation while Tony is out of the room briefly), enabling them to provide the audience with key background info on the marriage situation and their feelings about it and each other.

There are probably other films that would appeal to a broader audience if they came with alternative plot twists and endings.  (Akin to the appeal of ""alternative history."")  Call the alternative version(s) ""Consumers' Cuts.""  I bet consumers' cuts could improve quite a few movies, although more changes would be needed to some of the sow's ears out there than the tiny tweaks I've suggested to this masterpiece.

PS:  Director Stephen Soderbergh expresses similar thoughts (in ""Wired,"" 12/05, p. 257):  ""I'd like to do multiple versions of the same film.  ...  People can see either or both.""",1126656000,2,4552,4.805912596401028
771090,5,6304039530,"This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.

The movie 'Dial ""M"" for Murder' is film adapted from a successful play.  Alfred Hitchcock directed this picture and since almost all of the movie takes place in one setting, it really does have the look of a play put on film.  But that does not in anyway denegrate the quality nor entertainment value of this movie.  On the contrary, because of a brilliantly conceived story, coupled with superb acting, the film is terrific.

The story is set in London and involves a love triangle between a retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), his wealthy and beautiful wife Margot (Grace Kelly), and an American novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).  Halliday returns to London after an extended absence and Tony knows about this affair and concocts a brilliant plot to murder his wife.  He develops what seems like a perfect murder plan by blackmailing an old college friend Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson), into committing the murder so that Tony has a perfect alibi.  This sets up the remainder of the film where a death occurs and an investigation is opened by the police, and Tony, Halliday and the police detectives match wits figuring out what really happened.

The film is rather simple in format and even though there are several twists, the real magic of the movie is how well Tony Wendice, Halliday and the police intellectually involve themselves in the murder plot.  Another major strength of the movie is the performance of Ray Milland, who plays a smooth, charming and very cunning mastermind of what seems like the perfect murder.  His cool composure from beginning to end in all sorts of troubled spots is an amazing sight to watch. When he confronts Swann with his plan, Swann seems like a trapped animal and appears to have no choice to commit the crime since Wendice has him between a rock and a hard spot.  But the murder seems so well thought out that the risks appear to be minimal.  Once the police are involved, Chief Inspector Hubbard played by John Williams shines as well with superb detective work figuring out how and why this killing really occurred.  Grace Kelly also does a fine acting job in this film.  Overall, its a great movie, but clearly a lesser challenging film for Hitchcock's cinematic brilliance.  This was originally filmed in 3-D, so the movie exploits a lot of foreground/background subjects instead of showing characters and props mostly equal distant to the camera.

The DVD transfer is top notch.  There is virtually no film deterioration present and the full-screen color is vibrant.  The sharpness is very good, but not great and there were a few times some of the subjects seems out of focus, but that's probably attributed to the 3-D technology of that era.  Overall, its still an excellent visual presentation of the movie.  The sound was fine also. The extras include a short documentary analysis of the film plus a very short segment on the history of 3-D.

771095,4,6304039530,"""Dial M for Murder"" (1954) revolves around a plot by a gold- digging former tennis star, Ray Milland, to have his wife murdered for her money.  Grace Kelly, then at the very peak of her career, plays the spouse to elegant perfection. Quite early in the film, Milland blackmails an old college pal, Robert Dawson, to do the deed.  Milland's manner is a bit too slick and convenient. But the leading man is so convincing -and such a likeable villain-that most viewers won't ask questions till DMM is over! One could also carp that Hitchcock could have delayed hatching the scheme but the same point holds.  Milland is so archly smooth that most observers are pulled along. This reviewer tries not to reveal resolutions and won't do so here.  Suffice it to say, matters unravel! The dead body is Dawson's and not Kelly's!  All must watch closely at this point. Milland tampers with ""key evidence"" at the crime scene-before the law arrives- and tries to pin the rap on his wife!  John Williams plays the prim and proper London detective to the hilt, as he did in such films as ""The Midnight Lace"" and ""To Catch A Thief"". (Dawson was also a bad guy in ML).  Watch as Williams creatively sifts the evidence. Most viewers seem to have little use for Robert Cummings, who foppishly plays Kelly's old boy friend. This reviewer agrees;  his role could have been truncated or eliminated. One wonders how many will notice without prompting that DMM plays out with mostly one setting. That reflected its' stage origin. While neither of 5 star quality, nor one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, this is prime entertainment and highly recommended. DMM is a perfect example of a basic detective story raised several levels by a talented cast, deft staging and a great Director.",1120694400,,1761,4.750819672131148

Unfortunately the movie is all about her intended death so she is not visible to the viewer for much of the movie.

Margo is married to Tony, played by Ray Milland while having an affair with Mark, a friend of theirs for the past year. Tony is aware of this but keeps it to himself. He contacts a college acquaintance that he has been tracking his movements and it seems like an interrogation when Tony lays out the plan to murder his wife thus being committed by this ""stranger"".

I would say the only thing that I noticed was no chemistry between the female character and the two males she was involved with. I bet if this were done today there would be another twist to have her involved with the Inspector as well. Dial M For Murder is truly a black and white gem worth watching.",1099612800,2,954,4.294444444444444
771137,5,6304039530,"Former tennis pro Tony Wendice found out many months ago that his wife Margot was in love with another man, Mark Halliday, an American author of crime novels.  After many weeks of planning, Tony sets in motion the perfect plan to kill his wife.  The only problem is, as Halliday unknowningly remarks, there's no such thing as a perfect murder, and when something goes wrong, Tony has to quickly formulate another plan to do away with his wife.

This is a classic of suspense from director Alfred Hitchcock, based upon a very successful stage play.  All the actors - Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams - all give fine performances, but Milland's as Tony Wendice is a standout.  You're instantly won over by his conniving charm, and I admit to following his plan with a tiny bit of satisfaction.  He's never over-the-top, remaining perfectly cool and collected even when things go awry.  Hitchcock's directorial style also keeps the viewer confined to the apartment, only venturing outside very infrequently.  As with the play, much of the action takes place in that small space, and Hitchcock uses it to his advantage with intricate staging and camera angles.

The DVD is wonderfully clear with sharp sound as well.  The two featurettes are equally worth watching, especially the one on 3D.  I never knew that the film was originally shot as a 3D feature, and this goes into some detail about how Hitchcock set up many of the shots without relying too much on the effects.  Even as a flat screen movie, the film works perfectly.  This movie is a genuine pleasure to watch and should be part of any movie buff's collection.",1098662400,84,1646,4.794326241134752
771138,5,6304039530,"Hitchcock stirs up the dust in his classic thriller Dial M for Murder as the story surrounds the former tennis professional Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) who wishes to accomplish the perfect murder of his wife, Margot (Grace Kelly). Tony wants to commit the murder because his wife had an affair over a year ago, which he found out about through a letter. However, as expected something goes wrong and Tony must find a new solution to his plan. The secret of the film is not the killer, but rather if Tony will get away with murder.

Hitchcock displayed brilliant directorial skills as the film keeps its claustrophobic atmosphere while the camera remains in the center of the Wendice living room throughout most of the film. The claustrophobic atmosphere enhances the suspense as you feel cornered and you know that there is no escape, and if the plan should work there can be no mistakes. The close proximity to everything and the predominant use of only one set creates a theatrical scene  However, unlike in theater the audience will feel like they are one of the witnesses in middle of the room who is eavesdropping on Tony's hideous plan and crime. Through staying on the same location the audience gets much time to recognize details and understand the importance of them in the story.

Dial M for Murder offers a terrific cinematic experience as it offers both suspense and some issues to ponder. The details and depth of the film that truly enhance the cinematic experience are directly related to Hitchcock's input on what should be in the mise-en-scene. The mise-en-scene is absolutely marvelous as it offers detailed information about the characters and adds suspenseful intrigue and surprise.",1097366400,4,1702,4.923344947735192

The glasses were sometimes cardboard and sometimes plastic but they had polarized lenses which produced no color distortion whatsoever.

To my mind, it is a very great pity that this release does not include a field-sequential 3-D version.

771140,5,6304039530,"Two Grade-A Alfred Hitchcock motion pictures were released in the year 1954: the spectacular ""Rear Window"" and this other delicious little number called ""Dial M For Murder"".

Scissors, latch keys, stockings, telephones, and blackmail notes are all important set-pieces that help drive this movie along.

""Dial M"" is heavily dialogue-driven, although the attempted murder scene is very well done -- and quite suspenseful indeed. I'm guessing that when viewers watched this film in movie theaters in '54, there was probably a huge cheer after Grace did what she had to do to stay among the living. Great scene.

But, for me, the very best part of this stylish thriller/drama comes near the beginning of the film.  The scene I refer to is a very lengthy one (22 minutes long to be precise). It's the scene in Ray Milland's apartment (flat) where he coaxes Mr. C.A. Swan into taking the grisly job which Milland has to offer.

I love the way this ""set up"" scene is written and plays out.  It has a very realistic (and kind of eerie) feel to it.  Tony Wendice (Milland) has certainly done his homework, and that fact is conveyed to us with little doubt. Tony's got everything figured out right down to the exact minute he needs to call the flat to ""entice"" his wife to the telephone the next evening. And he's very nearly thought of everything. Very nearly....everything except those pesky scissors that Grace left on the desk.

Tony's murder weapon in this fiendish plot is C.A. Swan, played to absolute perfection by Anthony Dawson. Dawson emanates a kind of creepiness and shadiness that fits his character to a tee (similar to an eerie role Dawson played six years later in the Doris Day film, ""Midnight Lace"", which has Dawson exuding a heightened level of ""creepiness"" in various scenes in that 1960 thriller).

The moment Swan (Dawson) enters Wendice's dwelling, a subtle feeling of tension and slight uneasiness comes across the screen. You know something is afoot.  Hitchcock seems to have had an unparalleled ability to convey this sense of dread, disquiet, and trepidation without having to beat us over the head with it. It's just THERE, slightly beneath the surface. You can feel it somehow.

Veteran character actor John Williams plays Chief Inspector Hubbard, who is working overtime to crack this tricky case. And he does a fine job of it too, as it turns out. Williams, it seems, made a living out of portraying this kind of law-enforcement character. He played the exact same type of role in the aforementioned movie, ""Midnight Lace"", in addition to a similar recurring role as an ""Inspector"" in Mr. Hitchcock's very own self-titled TV series.

""Dial M For Murder"" plays out kind of like a Sherlock Holmes mystery, Alfred Hitchcock style, with Williams in the part of Sherlock here, as he pieces together the clues to resolve the case. It's a low-key drama that is set in virtually one single location -- an apartment. Very few scenes take place outside Milland's home setting, which is very reminiscent of Hitchcock's other 1954 endeavor, ""Rear Window"", which also takes place practically in just a single room.

Video quality is excellent on this disc, IMO. The film looks clear, detailed, and rich in color. Some grain and ""noise"" are evident in some scenes, but it's never distracting in the least. Overall, a darn good-looking digital video transfer. The aspect ratio is Full-Frame (1.33:1), which was the original framing as shown in theaters in 1954. Audio is supplied by a highly-adequate Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono soundtrack.

Menus are simple (and static) in nature. A ""scissors"" icon guides our way around the menu screens (which seems most appropriate here). :)

Packaging is attractive and colorful, and appears to come from original 1954 artwork for the film. No paper (chapter) insert is included with this DVD release. ""Scene Selections"" are included on the disc itself (as is the norm, of course, for nearly all movies on DVD). There are 5 separate ""Scene"" screens on this disc, providing instant access to any of the film's 28 different chapters.

DVD Bonus Features:

Two short featurettes are included on the disc --- ""Hitchcock And Dial M"" (with a run time of 21:33) and ""3D: A Brief History"" (7:06). ...............

""Hitchcock And Dial M"" is an enjoyable and informative bonus, produced by ""DVD Supplemental Materials King"" Laurent Bouzereau. Several talking heads, including Peter Bogdanovich, chat about ""Dial M"" and about Hitchcock's filmmaking techniques. Clips from the film are shown throughout this bonus feature, as are many behind-the-scenes still photographs.

""3D: A Brief History"" is another Laurent Bouzereau short, which gives us a cursory overview into how ""3-D"" movies were made back in the 1950s. ""Dial M For Murder"" was indeed originally shot by Mr. Hitchcock in the 3-D process -- with the famous scissors literally ""leaping"" out of the screen at audience members who saw the film in theaters, provided each movie-goer was wearing a pair of those cardboard ""3-D glasses"". (I can see why 3-D films failed to catch on in a really big fashion. Having to sit through a two-hour film while constantly wearing those ill-fitting, uncomfortable makeshift eyeglasses would get tiresome very quickly, in my opinion. LOL.)

Even though ""Dial M"" *was* filmed with ""3-D"" in mind, there is no way to view the movie in 3-D while playing this DVD-Video (even if you happen to have a pair of those colored glasses lying around the house). But that's really a minor point; because ""Dial M"" doesn't really need any ""gimmick"" (like 3-D) to be enjoyed. It's a winning Hitchcock effort no matter how it's viewed.

One other bonus resides on this disc -- The Theatrical Trailer for ""Dial M"" (2:35). For some odd reason, this trailer is shown in Widescreen format here, even though the film itself was photographed in a Full-Frame ratio.

Other disc info ....... Spoken Languages on this DVD are English and French (Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono for both). There are Subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.

This movie is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock flicks, being firmly anchored by two highly-rewatchable moments/scenes --- that very intriguing lengthy early act in the picture featuring Milland and Dawson .... and those very handy scissors!",1095379200,10,6275,4.978011472275335

771142,4,6304039530,"While it lacks the creative vision of ""Vertigo"", the suspense of ""North by Northwest"" or the daring of ""Rear Window"", ""Dial M For Murder"", like ""To Catch a Thief"", features Hitch coasting. That doesn't mean that the film isn't effective or has no value. It's just less personal than his other thrillers and its a great little suspense thriller that, sadly, isn't presented in its original 3-D format.  Based on the play by Frederick Knott, Hitchcock chose to keep the production simple. It tells the story of a playboy tennis player (Ray Milland)who plots to have his wife (Grace Kelly)murdered by an old school chum he's blackmailing. When the murder plans go awry, Milland's character sets it up to look like his wife planned a murder over blackmail. An American mystery writer (Bob Cummings)comes to her aid. He's annoying to the Inspector (the delightful John Williams recreating the role he played on stage) who suspects there's more going on regarding the murder.

A delightful and fun suspense thriller, Warner sprung for the extras here with a short documentary and a featurette. The documentry focuses on the making of the film. The featurette has director (""Jaws 3-D"") and production designer (""Jaws"") Joe Alves explaining the 3-D process, limitations and how Hitch used it so effectively.  I'm disappointed that Warner Brothers didn't lavish a bit of extra attention here (given the recent popularity of ""Spy-Kids 3D"") and release it both ""flat"" and in 3D. Having seen it at a revival house in 3D, I can honestly say that Hitch uses the gimmick sublty only going for the throat during one suspenseful shot in the film.

In addition, we get an apprecation by film director M. Night Shaylaman. The theatrical trailer is also presented but I do wish that Warner had included a second disc (along with a couple of pairs of 3D glasses)with the 3D presentation. There's no booklet or sheet with chapter listings (pretty consistent for most of the Hitchcock releases from Warner Brothers and it's becoming more of a trend).

The DVD looks pretty good with vivid colors and little in the way of digital blemishes but some minor analog ones. Since the film was shot in 3D, it does effect the quality of the image a bit but, on the whole, it looks marvelous (particularly considering the age of the movie). While it isn't a classic in the vein of ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"", it's a delightful thriller full of witty dialogue and strong performances from Cummings, Milland (who replaced Cary Grant when Warner Brothers felt that Grant asked too much money for the part), Williams and the stunning Grace Kelly.

The film is packaged in a plastic Amray shell case (unlike the cardboard ones that Warner Brothers used to use for some of their earlier titles). None of the new Hitchcock releases has a chapter listing sheet.",1094601600,2,2820,4.876826722338205
771143,3,6304039530,"It seems Hitch' had a yen for tennis players.  In ""Dial M for Murder"" (1954) tennis pro, Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plots the demise of his wealthy wife, Margot (Grace Kelly) after he discovers that she is having an affair with prominent writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). But things backfire when Margot accidentally kills her attacker with a pair of scissors, thus opening up Tony's chances at improvisation. How clever will he be at keeping the truth at bay? Like Hitchcock's ""Rope"", this film pretty much sticks to one set - a claustrophobic apartment - slowly drawing all the plot elements more tightly around Tony's newly revised plan. He'll pin the attempted murder on Halliday instead. Shot during the briefly trendy period of 3-D, Hitch' chose to eschew the usual (let's throw things at the screen) gimmicky approach and instead shot ""Dial M for Murder"" with a distinct foreground, middle ground, background perspective that really places the audience in the center of the goings on. Only once, when Margot is being strangled by her attacker, does Hitch' succumb to the gimmick by having Margot reach behind her back (out into the audience) to grasp her lethal pair of shears; quite effective!

Unfortunately, ""Dial M for Murder"" is presented in its usual flat format on DVD. Though colors can be rich and vibrant, there is a decidedly pasty look to the overall palette that is rather unbecoming and very unnatural looking. Blacks are deep but not very solid. Fine detail is generally lost in a picture that is generally softly focused. All of these shortcomings are the product of 3-D's cumbersome process.  Edge enhancement is present but does not terribly distract. Some pixelization and shimmering of fine details is detected also. The audio is mono but nicely cleaned up.",1093737600,8,1791,5.003355704697986

Home 3-D technology is readily available (see, for example, the ultimate 3-D collection or IMAX 3-D releases to home dvd)and costs less than $100.  The producers of the dvd could easily include the 3-D version as a bonus feature; once the encoding is done, the additional production costs would be next to nil, and the public could finally see this masterpiece as originally filmed.

771145,5,6304039530,"From a director's standpoint, this is by far one of the greatest thrillers ever made and I don't say that lightly (since Hitchcock practically invented the genre). If you've seen the film before, you know what I say is true. If you haven't seen the film yet, thank heavens it's finally coming to DVD.

 What makes this film such a marvelous gem is the fact that it holds one of Hitchcock's most notable trademarks: telling a story in a single location without it ever being a bore (see Rear Window and Rope).

 Another brilliant thing I love about the film is (if you haven't seen it skip this paragraph!) is that one of the characters tells us EXACTLY what will happen in the last 20 seconds or so, and you don't realize it until it's already happening. What makes Hitchcock films so involving is the control of information; when we see the key Ray Milland removes from Anthony Dawson's pocket, we of course assume that's Grace Kelly's latch key. As a filmgoer who frequently is able to predict the ""twist"" ending in most modern day films, I have to admit that when the secret of the key was revealed, I almost fell out of my chair; the thought just never occurred to me (and I also didn't realize Dawson plays both the assassin AND the inspector in the film).

 There isn't much more I can say about the film. I can't give it any higher praise. It's well made, well acted, well written, and especially well directed. This is the kind of film that, after you see it, you just want to watch it a few more times in a row (or see more of Hitch's films). It's the kind of film that, after you see it, you wonder why they don't make movies like this anymore.",1091491200,4,1654,4.371335504885994

Through the film runs we tend to forget that initial premise and we defend the victim . The same mechanism is used in Psycho or Strangers in a train .

The remarkable point is interesting since it demonstrates that nobody is innocent , but less guilty  .

Ray Milland is superb as the cheated husband , he will build a complex plan to convince and ancient schoolmate who actually is not a winner , showing him a picture from his school times (where we see once more to Hitchock in this , clear , funny and very often device from the suspense master)and persuades to him to murder his own wife .

All in theory seems to work out in a perfect level , but as always the human factor appears struggling the neck to the anticipated destiny.

Grace Kelly is extraordinary and to me , she never was best in any other Hitchcock film . The movie is loaded with ironical bits and the typical english clever humor .

771289,4,6304039530,"Dial M for Murder is not one of the all time greats of the Master, but it still has its merits.  Based on a play by Friedrich Knott, it features the suave Ray Milland playing Tony Wendice, former tennis star.  He's married to Margot (Grace Kelly) who is actually having an affair with Mark (Robert Cummings).  Tony hatches a plan to blackmail a former school chum to come to their house and kill Margot when Tony is away.  The main part of the plan involves Tony calling Margot to get her to stand by the phone and give the killer his chance.  The plan, needless to say, does not go off as planned and some further decisions need to be made.
It's obvious that this was originally a stage play, as the majority of the picture takes place in the Wendice's apartment.  It also was released in 3-D when it came out in 1954, something that really didn't help its popularity.  The play was perfect for Hitchcock, who showed over and over his ability to do masterful work even when contained in one space for a long period of time (see Lifeboat, and Rear Window, which came out the same year as Dial M).  The performances are superb.  Milland as the overconfident Brit, Cummings as the uptight American, and Kelly as the clueless beauty who just can't believe her husband could be so cruel.  I also loved John Williams as the inspector from Scotland Yard.  He also thinks highly of himself and it's great watching him go up against Milland.

771292,5,6304039530,"This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore.  Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its genteel and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.
This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which he adapted the screenplay.  (He also wrote the play upon which Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn was based.)  Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material.  He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.
Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security.  John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard.  He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair.  One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved.  Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse.  For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.
The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey.  It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery.  There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed.  I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened.  Follow the latchkey!
Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies.  I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything!  She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco.  Something was lost there, and something was gained.  She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis.  I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.
At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here.  Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and fitted (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint coyly at her subtle sexuality.  She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress.  She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.
So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore) look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.
By the way, the ""original theatrical trailer"" preceding these Warner Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the ""Coming Attractions""--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo.  You might want to fast forward to the movie itself.",1027209600,48,3493,4.935042735042735
771363,4,6304039530,"'Dial M for Murder' has many of the touches that one associates with Hitchcock, mainly, his masterly use of building up suspense and the way he makes you side with the villain, despite yourself. The acting is excellent. Ray Milland is convincing as the charming but devious husband who attempts to murder his wife, Grace Kelly, who makes a compelling and sympathetic victim. Only Robert Cummings grates as the insufferable 'hero', although this may have had to do more with the part than the actor himself.
The flaws of the films are a slight stiffness. There are two reasons for this. 'Dial M for Murder' was originally a play and most of the action takes place in one room. Necessary on a static stage, but limiting and unnatural in a film. It was also shot in 3D at the insistence, and against Hitchcock's objections, of the studios. Since the cameras necessary for 3D were bulky and difficult to manoeuvre, there is a lack of fluidity that adds to the feeling that you are watching a play rather than a film, even if it is an excellent play. However, Hitchcock still manages to produce good cinema. His slow build-up to the attempted murder scene and its thrilling climax is to see the master at his best.
A wonderful film that never bores and often startles. Not quite ""up there"" with Hitchcock's best, but an excellent film nevertheless.",1020211200,7,1343,4.694915254237288
771364,5,6304039530,"""Dial M  For Murder"" may not be Hitchcock's best movie, but it is the director at his best: telling a simple story, with some fine twists, a peculiar sense o humor and a catching plot. But as it is based on a stage play, it suffers from the same problem most films of this type do: it has few chatacters, not so many sets that makes it claustrophoic. Most of the actions takes place in one apartment, or better saying, in the living room of this place, what gives us the feeling of being locked there.
An ex-tennis player who is now having some money problems hire an ex-school mate to kill his wealthy and not faithfull wife so he can receive her heritage. The complex plan is detailed set, but he doesn't count on one suprise: she is not killed, instead she can kill the assassin. To make things worse she accused of murdering. From this moment on the film becomes a mouse and cat game trying to prove her innocent.
The cast is small but perfect. Grace Kelly plays the ingenous wife with so much beauty and dignity that it is impossible not to fall for her. On the other hand, it is impossible no to repulse her husband, perfectly played by Ray Milland. He is so false and disgusting that everybody roots for him get discovered. The script is perfect: everything makes sense and everything is in its right place.
Hitchcock's direction is irrepressible. Even though it is based on play and suffer from some problems, as I aforementioned. The plot is so interesting and catching, that these `problems' get invisible through the movie. Moreover, hsi peculiar sense of humor makes the film lighter and better to watch. The murdering scene is amazing, and I suggest you not to even blink, in order not to lose any moment of this sequence. The after-murdering develops in a incredible speed, Grace's trial is one of the most inventive of the cinema. Pay attention to her expressions and body movement during this specific scene.
This film has been remade a couple of times. I suggest you to check ""A Perfect Murder"" featuring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow. Both movies have the same premisse, but are led to different consequences. And the two films are good in their own way.",1016755200,3,2178,4.598971722365039
771365,3,6304039530,"Although Hitchcock's version of the popular play was considered a shocker in its day, repetition of the story in so many versions has made the story itself seem rather tame: a husband, angered by his wife's affair and in desperate need of money, blackmails an acquaintance to murder her--but his plans go awry when his wife kills her attacker in self-defense.
Both Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, as the faithless wife and her mild-mannered lover, give enjoyable performances, but the real success of the film is Ray Milland, who brings a slightly oily charm to his role of murderous husband.  Hitchcock's approach to the material is somewhat hampered by the fact that the film was originally shot in 3-D, and although the scene in which star Grace Kelly confronts her attacker is justly famous, the film is essentially a meticulous recreation of the stage success rather than a Hitchcock original.
Although familiarity with the material robs if of impact, most viewers will find Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER entertaining in an old-fashioned sort of way.  For myself, I wish the film could be released to videotape or DVD in the original 3-D format, so we might see how effectively Hitchcock handled the requirements of the form.  It might very well breathe new life into an old favorite.",1013472000,5,1290,4.935483870967742

Much of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which was by the author who wrote the play ""Dial M for Murder."" And what a superb play it is!
The acting is uniformly top-notch, but Ray Milland steals the show with his low-key performance as the murderous husband. Milland's subtle, shifting expressions let you see his alternating smugness and fear.
Hitchcock's direction is a little peculiar in places. Partly this is because the film was shot in 3-D. I've only seen it in 2-D, but Hitchcock sometimes placed something in the foreground and had the action take place in the background to enhance the depth of the cinemaphotography. I'm sure the 3-D audiences oohed and ahhed at this effect, but in 2-D it introduces a somewhat distancing effect.  Also, there was one part of the film with a couple of quick edits as if covering a mistake in the filming.  Still, Hitchcock's talent shines through as he keeps you engrossed in the action.

771367,5,6304039530,"Halfway between Rope and Rear Window, Dial M For Murder is a masterpiece of dialogue-driven thrills, filled with snappy lines, memorable characters and magnificent twists and intrigues. Blackmail, bribery, burglary, adultery, murder, manipulation and set-ups all slot together into one seamless, flowing crescendo of a roller coaster ride that takes you up and down and in and out of alternating suspense and excitement. Originally written as a play, the writing is so intelligent that this film surpasses the narrow constraints of its genre, avoiding any level of predictability &#8211; every time you think you know what's going to happen, something comes dashing at you from a completely different angle and knocks you into another direction, until you just hold on and see where you end up. The acting, though not outstanding, serves its purpose admirably, and you feel for the characters and do actually care whether they live or die, which is always a bonus in a story revolving around murder. A number of long takes keep the film moving swiftly onwards, and despite its for the most part one-room setting, making it obviously lacking in spectacle, it never becomes stale.
Dial M for Murder is seen as one of Hitchcock's weaker films because of its complete lack of pretension &#8211; I guess it's just what constitutes your taste in films. A lot of people dislike this film because it is plot-driven and not, dare I say it, arty and high-brow, but don't think that means it is devoid of creativity. Though it is set almost entirely within one flat, Hitchcock far exceeds the limitations placed upon such a setting. The tension created by the camera circling Grace Kelly when she is on the phone is intense, the frequently astounding camera shots that swoop in from the other side of the room to extreme close-ups of, for example, keys, are ingenious instruments of plot-progression, and the top-down soon-to-die shot as the murder is planned is definitely worthy of note. If you want the camera to tell the story, then this isn't the film for you, but if you're okay with the idea of a film that contains &#8211; God forbid &#8211; dialogue, and intelligent, stirring, rip-roaring, rousing dialogue at that, then Dial M For Murder is the perfect movie.
I would recommend this film to virtually everyone. If you like the theatre or reading books or listening to radio plays, you'll like this. If you like plot-based movies, you'll love this one &#8211; it could teach today's films a thing or two about substance. If you like dialogue-based films like anything by Quentin Tarantino, Polanski's Chinatown or The Usual Suspects, you'll like Dial M For Murder. If you've ever watched more than one episode of Colombo, you will love it. If you like Grace Kelly, you'll like this. But (and it's a big but) if you prefer action and explosions to plot, Jean-Luc Goddard to Robert Zemeckis, avant-garde to Hollywood or the second half of Titanic to the first, then you'd probably be best giving this film a miss.",994723200,13,3010,4.915520628683693

771369,5,6304039530,"""Dial M For Murder"" is one of Hitchcock's lesser known movies from the fifties. It was taken from Frederick Knott's successful stage play and he also wrote the screenplay. The film had a strong cast which included Ray Milland, Robert Cummings, and, in her first film for Hitchcock, Grace Kelly. The supporting cast included John Williams and Anthony Dawson. The film was made in 3-D but never released in this form here in the U.K.
Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is aware that his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is having an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Margot is hoping for a divorce but her husband has other plans - Tony is alarmed about the thought of having to live without his wife's money so he decides to have her murdered. By chance he runs into an old college acquaintance called C. A. Swann (Anthony Dawson) who is known to have a criminal past and has in fact been in prison. Tony decides that Swann would be the ideal man to do the murder as he has no connection with Margot and offers him 1,000 to do the deed. Swann is reluctant at first so Tony has to resort to blackmail threatening Swann with exposure of some of his past criminal activities to persuade him to become involved. On the night of the planned murder Tony is dining out at a restaurant with Mark and some others (which is to be his alibi). He has left a key under the stair carpet for Swann to enter the apartment and at 11.0 p.m. Tony will phone Margot from the restaurant - Swann will be hiding behind the curtains and when Margot answers the phone he will strangle her from behind. The perfect crime - or is it? Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances things don't quite work out as planned and there are many twists and turns before the police inspector (John Williams) has got it all figured out.
Some favourite lines from the film:
Robert Cummings (to Grace Kelly): ""I can see this is going to be a rough evening. All of us saying nice things to each other"".
Ray Milland (to Anthony Dawson): ""I thought of three different ways of killing him. I even thought of killing her - and that seemed a far more sensible idea"".
Kelly (to Cummings): ""Do you really believe in the perfect murder?"".
John Williams (to Cummings): ""They talk about flat footed policemen. May the saints preserve us from the gifted amateur"".
Hitchcock's cameo appearance in this film is a little different as he doesn't actually appear ""in person"". He is seen in the school reunion dinner photograph that Ray Milland shows to Anthony Dawson early in the film. Robert Cummings had starred in a previous Hitchcock film called ""Saboteur"" (1942). Grace Kelly went on to make two more films for Hitchcock - ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch a Thief"" (both in 1954).  Talented character actor John Williams was also in Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"". ""Dial M For Murder"" was remade in 1998 as ""A Perfect Murder"" with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen (the last named was also in the remake of ""Psycho"").  Another of Frederick Knott's plays made into a film was the excellent thriller ""Wait Until Dark"" starring Audrey Hepburn.",991526400,8,3100,4.644808743169399
771370,5,6304039530,"Let's forget for a moment that Alfred Hitchcock was the best director at creating and sustaining gut wrenching suspense.  That will always be his trademark; the ability to milk the tension of a scene to the very last drop.
The Master of Suspense?  It's just too easy to classify him as this suspense thriller hack and dismiss his many virtuoso talents.
What I'd like to remember Mr. Hitchcock for is his ingenious ability to create a sense of pathos & psychosis in most of his main protagonists and villains; meanwhile having us relate to them in their immoral behaviors.  Deftly, Mr. Hitchcock uses this transference (from screen character to viewer) so we can relate and identify directly to their situations and motivations however moral or immoral.
In Dial M for Murder, we can't help but to go against our own moral judgement and wish that the murder of Grace Kelly's character goes as planned by her husband.  In the film's expository, a murder plan is hatched.  Mr. Hitchcock masterfully sets up this scene with a changing of the point of view in the story and main characters.  We are soon aware that the Ray Milland character is the central figure and he has the central motivation throughout the film. (although this changes later in the story)
What's haunting and eerie about this film's premise is Hitchcock's use of the point of view throughout the film.  We see the film through Milland's eyes and there are many POV shots to prove it.
With a bit of reservation, when the dramatic first half climax arrives we hope that the hired killer stays long enough to carry off his execution of the Grace Kelly character.  The reason is because Hitchcock has conditioned our response with tension and suspense in this highly dramatic situation.  We see Milland's watch has stopped, a restless hired killer ready to abort, a man taking up precious time on a pay phone, and the extreme close up of the dial number.  In ""western"" film narrative with all of these suspense elements inter cut together we expect a big payoff.  And the audience wants to see this murder carried out.
Variations of this theme were played out beautifully in Robert De Niro's, Travis Bickle character at the ending climax of Taxi Driver and Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal character in The Silence of the Lambs.  (When Hannibal escapes that weird detainment configuration and Travis shoots down the pimps we are rooting for murder)
This is something Mr. Hitchcock knew way ahead of its time and it's a very odd dynamic; a compelling reality in the audience to movie-story relationship.",983145600,,2557,4.826086956521739
771371,3,6304039530,"But good nonetheless. Grace Kelly is luminous here; as my husband says, ""Why would anyone want to murder Grace Kelly?"" Indeed! Overly complicated; the twists and turns are somewhat hard to follow--pay attention to the key. Kelly's character is a little too victimized here for my taste (but apparently not Hitchcock's); she tends to do whatever hubby (Ray Milland) dictates. He totally dominates and patronizes her. What in the world did she see in him in the first place?
Robert Cummings is not the hunky mate we would wish for Kelly; would that Milland was not a murderous SOB so they could ignite some sparks. Better to enjoy ""To Catch a Thief"" for spark-igniting between Kelly and Cary Grant.
An interesting watch, though, just to see the interplay between Kelly and Milland, who fell in love during filming. Alas, Milland would not leave his wife. Oh, well, some day her prince will come.",980726400,2,893,4.8431372549019605
771422,2,6304039530,"Grace Kelly, in training, had not discovered how to GLOW for the camera.  Reportedly having an affair with Milland at the time, there is no chemistry  to suggest they are aware each other is on the same soundstage.  Robert  Cummings, mega-dosing on vitamins, would have been better served by an  anachronistic vial of Viagra.  Sir Alfred is asleep at the wheel this time  around, too.  A 3-D pair of bloody scissors tossed into the DVD audience  would help disturb the snooze.  Apparently the rotund one had not yet  calculated how a significant musical score might help a turkey fly!",967766400,4,584,4.797979797979798
771423,5,6304039530,"It seems that one never tires of this film. It is just so entertaining. The script, the dialog, the acting, the sets, the colors, the editing,  Dimitri Tiomkin's score and Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful direction in the  confined set all congeal into a now classic film (even though Hitchcock  somewhat played down the importance of this film in his list of directorial  achievements). This VHS copy looks much better than earlier releases of  this title.",966124800,4,455,5.094594594594595
771424,4,6304039530,"This Hitchcock has always intriged me for several reasons. The way He fit all the pieces of this complex mystery so perfectly in place IS kind of hillarious, however, the aspect of this film that most overlook is the  rich, luscious color!  Look closely at the texture of of the hues!  This  puppy is a beauty!",964742400,2,310,4.482142857142857
771425,5,6304039530,"I finally saw this movie and loved it.  It reminded me a lot of Rear Window in set up and characterization, but a totally different story.
A man plans a perfect murder with a perfect alibi which goes off less than  perfect the main character then tries to convert the perfect murder into  the perfect frame up.
Grace Kelly is fantasitc in her role as the murders  wife.  I see why Hichcock loved to work with her.",962755200,4,413,4.311688311688312
771426,4,6304039530,"Although reviews tend to vary on this movie, I think it is one of Hitchcocks 10 best.  Although the movie does not have as much mystery, suspense, or action as many of Hitch's other films, it does feature  terrific acting, a good plot, and great direction, editing, and  cinematography.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly put in terrific performances.  Milland puts in such a good performance that you almost find yourself  rooting for him to get away with his crime.  I thought Robert Cummings was  just average, but the role of the Inspector is one of the better supporting  characters in any Hitch film.  The ending, while not as famous as those in  North by Northwest or Strangers on a Train, is so casual that I think it  ranks as one of the best, if not the best, of all Hitch endings.",961459200,7,785,4.48936170212766
771427,5,6304039530,"I love ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch A Thief,"" which are two of the three movies that Grace Kelly and Alfred Hitchock collaborated on.  But I had always heard ""Dial M For Murder,"" the first of the  three Grace starred in for the director, was a dissapointing film, so it  took a long time for me to get around to watch it.  I finally rented it a  few months ago, and WOW! I find it's a great film, and I loved it!  Grace was beautiful as always, and Ray Milland did an excellent job as the  ""villain"" of the film.  The plot was engrossing, and did I  mention Grace Kelly was beautiful?  But be warned, ""Murder""  is a psychological mystery, and a dialogue movie.  It has little action,  other than the murder attempt itself.  So if you are looking for a typical  twisty, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat Hitchock suspense film, its probably  best that you look for ""Vertigo,"" ""Rear Window"" or  ""North by Northwest"" instead.  But give ""Dial M For  Murder"" a chance, and be ready to enjoy a great film, definitely  deserving of a five star rating!",959212800,7,1038,4.508108108108108
