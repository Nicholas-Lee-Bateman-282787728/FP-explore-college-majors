4980651,1,B0069RX7TY,"I agree that I should have checked the running time ""before"" I let my boys purchase this.  (I checked it on the Ice Age one and put it back.)  I was in a hurry.  Still, it should say on the front cover that it is NOT a movie, that it is a SHORT Film.  It is not even half a movie.  Half a movie should be 45 minutes to an hour.  Bonus features are not part of the movie!!  They are a ""BONUS"" a.k.a. ""extras"".  We didn't even open it once I noticed it was 22 minutes.  We would not be able to return it if it was opened.  So we will wait to buy a used one.  I think it should have been priced lower.  Like $5.  22 minutes is about 1/3 of an hour.  Most movies are 2 hours.  What a disappointment.  Seems like it was purposely marketed to kids at Christmas time.  I feel bad for anyone who paid the full price of $15.  Not cool!  My boys are so bummed and can't believe they were charged $10 to watch 22 minutes of film.  I don't care how good it is.  It was not clearly marketed.  Kids are not going to look at the ""fine print"" and they shouldn't have to!  And it is their money (a gift from grandma)so we can complain if we want to.  We are  consumers who were not satisfied with our purchase.  That's what these reviews are for.  I hope this informs someone before they purchase something they thought was going to be a sequel movie to the first one.  It is not.",1325980800,11,1363,3.9298892988929888

4980653,5,B0069RX7TY,"All these reviews complaining about it being a short film are way off. It tells you right on the back of the dvd case that it is 22 minutes long. When I saw the low price, the first thing I did was check the back for the length.
1. $10-$11 for a half-length movie is about right. Many full length DVD's today are around $20 at release.
2. The original, big-name voice actors returned. This was not voiced by alternate, replacement actors.
3. It has some good additional, special features. (Much more than 22 minutes of entertainment overall)
4. The special effects/graphics are excellent and were not low quality.
I really enjoyed this movie. It had me laughing and entertained through the whole movie. It just never got boring.",1322697600,5,728,4.651162790697675
4980654,1,B0069RX7TY,ok i  was soo excited to see this at walmart thinkin it was a full length dvd. and yes it pick up right where the other left off. so i got it and watched it and hey guess what....?? 22 mins after it was over.!!! not even 50 min long and sooo wasn't worth the 10 bucks i wasted on it.,1321833600,8,283,3.639344262295082
4980655,5,B0069RX7TY,"This film picks up where the last one leaves off. The Vikings in the village of Berk live in harmony with the dragons thanks to Hiccup and Night Fury. As the winter holidays approach, one that resembles our Christmas, but is not, all the dragons take off in mass migration. Astrid decides to cheer everyone up by creating new holiday traditions...first one is yak-nog, a near tasty beverage everyone tries to avoid. Still the village is concerned over the dragons departing, that is everyone except for one person who mysteriously pretends he is upset....but why?

Second new winter holiday tradition...hiding dragon eggs. This is a short feature of 22 minutes. There are plenty of extras in the DVD such as the deleted scenes which includes a third holiday tradition, ""Missing Toe"" which they really wanted to keep in the film, but couldn't due to time constraints. It also has a dragon training sequence as well as a DVD-ROM that includes games for youngsters.

As a stand alone DVD, the 22 minute feature is good, but not worth the purchase price. If you plan on viewing and using all the extras, then it is worth the purchase.",1321747200,36,1130,4.760204081632653

4980758,5,B0069RX7TY,I bought this for myself and for all my HTTYD loving friends for Christmas last year. It was a great film that picked up exactly where the first movie left off. It was of equally high quality and was a great 20 something minute long dose of HTTYD that was so needed between the first and second movies coming out!

4980761,5,B0069RX7TY,"For lovers of HTTYD, this is a fabulous story suitable for the whole family.  Oriented around a Christmas type celebration, the story has enjoyed plenty of repeat viewing with my 5 & 7 yo girls, together with my wife and I.

The story briefly (without spoiler).  The dragons abruptly ""up and leave"" as a celebration on Berk approaches.  What was shaping up to be a particularly special event is left with the sad gaping void associated with the absence of their beloved dragons.  Hiccups dragon understanding is challenged in a way not seen before and the true strength of his bond with Toothless revealed.

Slight criticism was that there's only the one episode on the disc, which was a little unexpected but is reasonably reflected in the price.",1435449600,4,747,4.796875
4980762,4,B0069RX7TY,"Nice little Holiday addition to the Dragon movies.  I love these movies about Berk!  Very creative, exciting and delightful to watch.",1435190400,,133,5.285714285714286
4980763,4,B0069RX7TY,"Obviously, Im not keeping up on my Christmas specials since I just learned of several Dreamworks has done based on their popular franchises.  Such is the case with Dragons Holiday: Gift of the Night Fury.  Im glad I caught it since it was fun.

Its the first winter holiday in the village of Berk since they made peace with the dragons, and everyone is looking forward to really celebrating.  Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is even working on a special gift for Toothless, the ability to fly on his own.

But then one day all the dragons just fly away.  Why?  Will they ever come back?  And will this ruin the holiday?

While a fantasy period setting, Im not offended by the fact that this isn't a Christmas special since the Vikings didn't celebrate Christmas during that time period.  Oh, I know they could; after all, dragons never existed either.  Still, this is something worth noting only in passing.

Especially since all the hallmarks of a Christmas special are here.  Youve got comedy.  Youve got tender moments.  And youve got tons of heart.  What else do you truly need?

Truly, this is a very fun special.  The laughs are fairly constant, giving us plenty to enjoy.  I don't want to give anything away because the surprises are half the fun, but trust me, there is fun to be had.

And if the ending doesnt get you, something is wrong.  I saw it coming, but still it touched me.

The voice cast from the movie is back for this special, and they do a great job as always.  Likewise, the animation, while not quite up to movie standards, it still great and will impress you.

But don't take my word for it.  Next time you get a chance to watch Dragons Holiday: Gift of the Night Fury, do your self a favor and watch.  Its only half an hour, and you will enjoy it.

Note: I watched this as part of the Dreamworks Holiday Collection, which I was sent in exchange for my honest review.",1434067200,,1892,4.424418604651163

The story also shows that the choice made to stay with someone is a choice made through great love, respect, loyalty and regard, just as Toothless chose to fly with his old tail and Hiccup instead of by himself with his new tail.

4980850,2,B0069RX7TY,"This was an obvious cash-in off of the wildly popular and one of my all-time favorite movies How to Train Your Dragon. My 3-year-old daughter loves the original as well, so we wanted to get the holiday version short hoping it would at least have a few decent moments - enough to slip it into a Christmas tradition where we watch favorite holiday-themed movies. Although I knew better not to expect Hollywood-caliber production for a straight-to-DVD show, I still left with a big ""meh.""  There were some amusing moments and plenty of decor to give the holiday vibe, but wow, if the main voice actors weren't back, this would come across as a cheap knock-off.  While the dragons in the movie were playful, in this short they were one-dimensional goofballs.  The story was reminiscent of an after-school special.

If you absolutely need more Dragon goodness, watch the movie again. Save your money. If you need a great holiday-themed short with your favorite How to Train Your Dragon characters, hope for something else in the future. Don't spend your money on this.",1397260800,10,1063,4.856353591160221

4980866,4,B0069RX7TY,"DRAGONS HOLIDAY  GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY is set in the world of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and takes place sometime after the events of that movie. Once a year, the Vikings of Berk gather together and celebrate their one and only holiday, Snoggletog. They decorate a giant tree in the square, put up special decorations, and have a massive feast. This year Snoogletog is supposed to be even better because the Vikings now have their dragon companions living with them. However, before the festivities start all the dragons leave Berk and disappear in a massive migration. Well, not quite all the dragons: Toothless remains behind. Everyone is upset in the village and Hiccup sets out to not only find out what happened to the dragons, but help Toothless who seems left out.

Overall, I enjoyed watching DRAGONS HOLIDAY  GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY and felt it fits in well with the world of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. Some of the jokes surrounding Christmas traditions are kind of funny (such as yak nog instead of egg nog). However, other than elements of giving and family, there aren't many positive or holiday messages to be had here. Instead, you get Snoogletog and another adventure in Berk. Thats about it.

There are several extra features attached to DRAGONS HOLIDAY  GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY including a deleted scene, a dragon training sequence, and several games for youngsters.",1387497600,3,1379,4.801687763713081

4980872,4,B0069RX7TY,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a spectacular movie.  I loved every bit about it.  When I heard about ""The Gift of the Night Fury,"" I knew I had to see it.  It was great to see Toothless and Hiccup again.  It amazes me that I can adore a silent character just for his actions.  Toothless is a wonderful character.

Was this short on the same scale as the movie?  No.  However, the story was sweet with a lovely lesson for young children, yet with a strong enough connect to keep adults involved.",1365033600,,493,4.225806451612903

4980879,5,B0069RX7TY,"This short 22 minute (read the description!) movie picks up after the original How to Train Your Dragon ends. There are 2 things that I really appreciated with this video: ALL the original voice actors returned (not the voice actors from the series on Cartoon Network, but the ones from the first movie) and, most importantly, the video feels like it's part of the series. I mention this because so many sequels take an unpleasant detour in the plot line, almost as if to make a new story out of something that is already established. I like both the original movie and this sequel. If you haven't seen the original movie, then go watch it before you get this one.

Hiccup and Toothless clicked like magnets, and that really got to me. I got walloped by the movie when I watched it on DVD, and I've been a fan ever since.

I picked up Gift of the Night Fury hoping there would be just a few more moments like the ones I really liked in the movie.

It may be short, but there are many great moments, right from the start.  Hiccup is in bed, trying to sleep.  Toothless is up on the roof, trying to wake him up.  If you're a fan of the movie, the great moments start immediately.

There is a holiday theme the episode. The villagers are Vikings, of course. Norse mythology and things like rymskvia -- where the giant Thrym steals Mjlnir, so Thor and Loki go to a winter celebration in Jtunheimr to get it back -- would be impossibly tedious to explain. There is a tree, decoration, and gift exchanges, and that's it so far as the holidays connection.  I'm watching this for the characters, anyways.

Toothless and Hiccup do not disappoint.  Highly recommended.",1339286400,14,1135,4.331753554502369
