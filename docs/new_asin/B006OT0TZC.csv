5011332,4,B006OT0TZC,"A bus load of girls with their teacher head out to the desert from some exploration when they meet three bikers on the road, one of whom is a psychopath {resembling Jim Morrison*} who had already killed a gas station attendant by that time. When the bus breaks down, the driver is killed, the opportunity is seized and are taken to an abandoned shack where they are held with forced liberties taken, even with the teacher, even after an attempt with feminine wiles and encouraged intoxication, ends up to no avail.

One of the bikers {moreso a recreational 'motorist'} is a good-natured fellow who refuses to take part, eventually becoming their hero, after having been run off the road and left for dead. When one of the girls manages to abscond, she is hunted down by ""Al"" and smothered in the sand. Returning to the scene, an eventual face-off finally frees the girls as he heads out for civilization for help.

Zalman King portrays a most convincing psychotic, complete with a notable hissing snicker. A gritty thriller demonstrating unrestrained violent impulses set in the desert.

5011352,5,B006OT0TZC,Trip with Teacher is a masterpiece. The script breathes fresh life into the biker genre. The actors give great acting performances tha set this film above the majority of movies. The lighting and cinematography are first rate. This film is filled with effective tension and suspense. Zalman King gives one of the greatest acting performances ever as the antagonist: a rogue biker. The scene where he chases the girl into the woods and presses her head into the ground until she dies is a very powerful scene. You can feel the intensity here and it really lets you get immersed in the sequence. The film has a really catchy theme too. Highly recommended.,1469318400,4,653,4.787610619469026

5011392,3,B006OT0TZC,"TRIP WITH THE TEACHER (1974) is a Crown International B grade film, a one-time drive in movie special.
There's a typically no-name cast in this zero budget exercise in biker anarchy.

The story opens on a pair of brothers named Pete and Al, ex-jailbirds just wandering a desert road looking for misadventure and whatever comes their way. When one gets a flat tire, Jay, a Good Samaritan on a 10-day biking vacation, stops to help. The blown tire partly inflated, the three head toward the nearest service station. Along the way they encounter a small yellow chartered bus with a gangly simple-talking driver, a lady chaperone and four teen girls. All are doing a tour of pueblos, the Grand Canyon, etc.

This brief meeting is prelude to the main story.

At the gas station, the old guy who owns it is nasty to the two brothers. Jay never knows that this unlucky fellow ends up crushed under a car he was working on, a victim of crazy Al. Meanwhile the bus blows its fuel pump, thus the bikers and girls are reunited. Jay is not a participant in the violence that next occurs. He and the five women become prisoners at a remote abandoned house and it's obvious that none will survive once Al and Pete have had their fun.

Clearly Zalman King as psycho killer Al, is a cartoonish villain. He wears fithy jeans and the ugliest sungoggles imaginable. When not locked in a frozen stare he has a bizarre laugh and tends to briefly  black out under pressure. King's undistinguished career in front of the camera was spotty after 1979.

8502379,4,B006OT0TZC,This was a brutal film.  Way more terrifying than the average slasher horror.  Includes murder and rape with surprisingly no blood.,1514505600,,131,5.190476190476191
8502380,2,B006OT0TZC,"The heyday of the drive in began with low budget horror flicks and eventually morphed into low budget T&A movies. The films almost always took on some form of profession from student nurses to cheerleaders to teachers. Surprisingly while the titles may have made it seem that those in these chosen professions had the loosest of morals the films themselves actually were a bit more twisted. Yes, the characters were placed in definite misogynistic settings but they were also the most independent women on the planet. In the end while bad things happened they came out stronger, more self-aware and better off than their male counterparts.

All of that can be seen in TRIP WITH THE TEACHER. The name itself sounds like a low grade porn flick but it is far from it. The movie features a teacher on a field trip with a group of female students. Their destination is the desert area of the southwest. Side by side with their adventure is a motorcyclist who teams up with two other young bikers, brothers, one of which has a flat. What he doesnt realize is that one of them tends to lean towards anti-social psychopathic tendencies.

Their paths cross as they pass the bus and the girls flirt with them. When both end up at the next gas station they chat, the girls flirt some more and then head out on their way. Al (Zalman King), the psycho brother, kills the station attendant who was giving them a hard time without telling the other two, and their on their way.

The girls bus breaks down and the cyclists offer to help them. At least they claim to. Instead they kill the driver, assault the girls and eventually rape the teacher who offers herself up if theyll leave the girls alone. The third biker isn't part of this and is attacked by the brothers and left for dead. Now if only the girls can find a way to escape.

The movie features everything that those drive in movies looked for. We have sexy young girls, none of which looks under 25 even though they're playing teens. We have psycho bikers because hey, all bikers must be psychos right? Well with the exception of the one riding the old style motorcycle. We have a secluded location which works out great since the budget is miniscule at best. And the end result involves a form of revenge which was a classic plot device in these films.

The movie looks much like it would have on the large whitewashed screens of the drive in with little attention paid to focus or a decent film stock that would have provided a better picture. But these movies weren't made as art. They were quickly written, quickly shot no budget films that made back more than their investment playing from one end of the country to another. This one is a bit less than most which makes me think it was the second half of a double bill along the way.

The acting is high school level at best. Like I said, no one seems to fit the age that they are portraying. King always seemed to play characters like this one so his showing up here allows the audience to know right off the start hes the bad guy. His is the only character that really stands out here seeming like a method actor looking for some method to play the part.

With all that being said this is another of the films saved by Vinegar Syndrome. No, this isn't CITIZEN KANE in that it deserves major restoration and placed in a locked vault. But the movie itself depicts the type of film being made when it was released, a style of film made specifically for drive ins. The film company behind it, Crown International Pictures, was a company that made tons of movies for drive ins. They may not have been the best of the best but their history deserves to be preserved.

Vinegar Syndrome is presenting the film in the best way possible with plenty of extras on hand. To begin with the film is a 2k restoration from a 16mm original camera negative. There is a commentary track with director Earl Barton, actress Cathy Worthington and actress Dina Ousley, TAKING THE TRIP a video with actress Brenda Fogarty who plays the teacher, multiple TV spots, a still gallery and reversible cover artwork.
