7801245,5,1928951023,"My dog Brooke and I participated in Amy's training classes in Milwaukee, WI. Brooke and I followed Amy's basic guidelines until her passing. I purchased this video and Amy's Book ""Training In No Time"" as a refresher when I rescued my latest family member, Axel. These training techniques work and by no means illustrate or emphasize unnecessary force. I am excited to welcome Axel to both my home and Amy's training methods.",1484956800,,424,4.902777777777778
7801246,5,1928951023,"Our dog was aggressive towards other dog and it was making it very hard for us to even take him on a walk. He isn't a large dog, so we were not worried about him hurting anyone but it was very difficult to enjoy our neighborhood. He would growl, bark and snap at any dog that came within 10 yards of him.

Amy's video helped us immensely and he is much more socialized and well behaved now!",1434672000,,390,4.064935064935065
7801247,5,1928951023,"I was impressed with this training method because it works.  My former german shepherd was a rescue, and came to me as an aggressive dog with fear biting tendencies. Several trainers working with clickers and treats fled in fear of him!  After training with the same theories and methods as Amy Ammen's, I spent 11 years with a well trained and impressive dog that never had another bite on his record. I needed a refresher course for my current german shepherd, and Amy's video is fabulous.  He had a real issue with over interest in other dogs that he encountered on walks.  I was having trouble breaking him of this habit, and the ""sneak-away"" is a great tool in training for fixing this issue. I definitely recommend this video for those interested in solid training that will last the life time of the dog.",1428192000,2,811,4.611111111111111
7801248,5,1928951023,I have trained with Amy Ammen with several of my dogs.  She is never cruel or uses unnecessary force with any dog.  I just contacted her for help with my new puppy and she was there for me.  I would trust her methods and work with her in a heartbeat.,1426809600,,250,3.96
7801249,1,1928951023,"I really didn't want to give a star rating because I realize it's a matter of preference but I couldn't write a review without a rating. The one star rating reflects my preference for positive reinforcement based training.

I like to think that even as a pet dog owner and not a trainer I have the capacity to be a ""balanced trainer"" and able to think outside the box when need be; however the coercive, punishment based techniques in this video for even the simplest of behaviors like sit and down were frankly distastful. The segment on training a forced down was actually disturbing and nothing that I would visit upon any dog when my limited experience has taught me thus far that a treat and a clicker can yield a beautiful, snappy down not a dog flopping sideways like it was electrocuted.

If you are looking for outdated methods with lots of yanking and cranking, forced positioning and nailing dogs in the butt with throw chains then...have at it.",1370736000,2,956,4.617647058823529
