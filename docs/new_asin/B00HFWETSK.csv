6162181,1,B00HFWETSK,"Do NOT buy this badly adapted piece of German TV!  It is hopeless.  It clearly is copied from a German program with an obvious German viewpoint.  The interviews are mostly in German, with American English voiceovers.  The narrator appears to be a young American female who reads at, I would think, about 5th grade level, with frequent mispronunciations.  Unless you're German, this is a waste of time & money.",1397347200,18,409,4.869565217391305

8632581,4,B00HFWETSK,"This review is for the 13.75 hour 2 DVD version.

Here are the cons: All storytellers have a bias and this is certainly biased. Please consult multiple sources from multiple countries to get close to the truth. The female narrator mispronounces many terms. For example, she refers to the sticky Vietnam-era incendiary as nuhpalm rather than napalm. This appears to be originally produced in German, so there are weird text over text graphics when a talking head is onscreen. The male translator has a super-annoying, snobbish way of enunciating and phrasing.

The pros: Amazing photos and footage. The producers have taken 100 years of world history and organized and condensed it into less than 14 hours. That is an honorable feat. This is a great, inexpensive experience that will enrich anyone.",1455235200,6,797,5.076335877862595
8632582,2,B00HFWETSK,"What a waste of 10 bucks! Germany Germany Germany, Europe and Africa. I was getting tired of everything Germany and all the war tiebacks. I would think it was produced as Germany propaganda, but so much is negative. The last straw was 1976, coverage of a school uprising in Africa over the massive USA bicentennial. Coverage points of the US were; the roaring 20s/stock market crash, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, the challenger space blow up & Monica/ Bill. The creators are so proud there are no credits, also no real information on the back cover. I can't even imagine viewing the box set.",1436659200,9,593,4.766990291262136
8632583,5,B00HFWETSK,Very informative.  Thank-you.,1427587200,,29,8.666666666666666
8632584,2,B00HFWETSK,"Most of the stories just talk about photographs, leaving out important information about the time and event. Also skips out on the Civil Rights movement including the assassination of MLK Jr. and anything about Malcom X, also forgets to mention Woodstock, Manson murders, the Cool Aid mass suicide (can't think of a better way to put it) and many more things. Don't waste your money, there's gotta be something better out there. Should've included more things from entertainment, black history and not focus so much on Germany. Seriously out of 100% I'd guessetimate that 48% is about Germany",1424390400,12,592,5.051020408163265
