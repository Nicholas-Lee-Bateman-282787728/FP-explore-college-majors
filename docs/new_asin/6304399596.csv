It was a good film for its time but for kids growing up today, it doesn't connect with them.",1313884800,,263,4.176470588235294

This movie is the sequel to ""Katy Caterpillar"".(A hard video to find, but can be found usually on amazon every few months. It is about Katy as a caterpillar.  She is unhappy living in her cherry tree with her 3 siblings, so one day she decides to leave and embark on her own adventure to find herself.  Here she befriends a mouse whom she goes to the city with.  All the while, a mean cat and two mean crows are after them. It also shows Katy transform from a caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly. That was one of the things that I remembered while serching for these videos. A great movie.  I would give it 5 stars)

I have serched for this movie since I was 15.  I remember, my mother would always rent this movie for me as a special treat when I was much younger. I now have both of the Katy movies in my video library.

""Katy Meets the Aliens"", is about a single mother butterfly named,Katy,who now has two children(caterpillars)in this sequel and their names are Kiki,and Koko.(one boy and one girl) It starts off with the children wanting to learn how to fly.  So, they sneak off in the middle of the night while their mother is asleep to take flying lessons.  Unfortunately, the teacher (a bat) who is trying to teach them how to fly also has another trick up his sleeve, his true intent is to eat the caterpillars.  Well, they do get away only to come upon an ant colony, and they end up crashing into their food supply and the Queen Ant gets angry with them and won't let them leave.  They also have some run ins with a hawk that wears a leather jacket, and of course the aliens X,Y and Z who have come to earth looking for food since their food supply has run out on their own planet.

This is a good movie for young children and for the young at heart.  I have truly enjoyed each of these movies.  Happy Watching! :)",1104796800,,1906,4.272980501392758
7871137,1,6304399596,"In all my years as a fan of animation I can honestly say that Katy Meets the Aliens is the worst animated feature that I have ever seen.  It makes The Return of Jafar look like Fantasia.
The plot revolves around a group of unfunny aliens named X,Y, and Z who plot to invade the earth in search of food. One the aliens, who achieves the power of turning into any animal it sees but seldom actually takes puts it practical use.
Oposeing this creature is Katy the Butterfly, and her two children... but first there's a subplot involving a mean old owl, a running gag involving a skunk trying to take a nap, and a subplot involving a colony of ants the kids walk into.
Should you make it past this there's also a god-awful attempt at a heavy-metal song sung by a mean and nasty hawk who inexplicably wears a leather jacket.  Then there's even more awful music, before the kids meet a squirrel who sings a shockingly bad song called ""In the Good Old Days"" that will haunt you for life. Let me put it this way, if I had to chose between hearing this song again or being forced to listen to nails on a chalkboard for three hours strait, I would chose the chalkboard.
Meanwhile X (Or was it Y or Z) bounces around capturing animals, but never actually eating any of them, before confronting the kids, and dieing a truely pathetic death.  Oh wait, I won't spoil it, but by all means don't miss the shocking comic ending of Katy Meets the Aliens...  And weep for the medium.
And wouldn't you know it... Katy never does have a face-to-face meeting with the Aliens.",997142400,,1553,4.3633217993079585
