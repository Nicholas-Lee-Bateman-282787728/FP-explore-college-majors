8342982,5,B001U7IJS2,"I saw this movie when I was pretty young and thought it was interesting enough to remember parts of it. I finnaly found the movie again and after watching it as an adult, I think they did a great job with it. Obviously there were some parts of the movie that were less realistic than others, but thats what movies are for.
I think the story was well put together and well told. The cast did a good job of keeping me on my toes and thinking. Overall it is definitely worth warching, especially if you are interested in aliens and space.",1452038400,,535,4.254901960784314

After watching it all these years later, I still think it is an excellent scifi film, even by today's standards. The message of the movie is clear and the ""ETs"" are so creepy. The whole movie has an eerie feeling. Worth a watch.",1451347200,,352,3.971830985915493

THE ARRIVAL is a nightmarish sci-fier about an astronomer who first tunes into alien broadcasts and later discovers these shape-shifters have already come to Earth and are actively adapting our eco-system to their liking. The plan is to poison our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, thus raising the planet's mean temperature by about 25F.

Ron Silver is outstanding as an ET who's infiltrated JPL, the hi-tech company that Sheen works for, by morphing into and then replacing the boss Sheen reports to. When Charlie brings taped evidence of otherworldly broadcasts to Silver, he's fired from his job and the tape is destroyed. Sheen's partner in the radio location project (Richard Schiff) is murdered, but it's arranged to look like a suicide. This event and his job termination don't deter Sheen from working independently to tune into and capture on tape the transmissions he'd previously picked up.

When a signal originating from Mexico crosses in with the outer space one, Charlie travels there to locate the source. This is how he meets Lindsay Crouse, a climatologist investigating massive levels of greenhouse emissions. Their opportunity to work together ends when Crouse is murdered. Worse, Sheen is made to look like her killer after he trespasses at the supposed power plant, one of several that's ""terraforming"" Earth into a hothouse, and learns the full extent of the creepy-looking aliens' invasion and plans.

Confronting Silver with what he's learned just makes Charlie a target for elimination. The story's exciting climax occurs at a satellite dish broadcasting base, where Sheen and his girlfriend, Teri Polo, battle for both their lives and the survival of all humankind.

This great start to what could've been a phenomenal movie series was unfortunately kiboshed by an extremely mediocre sequel.

(6.3) The Arrival (USA/Mexico-1996) - Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Crouse/Richard Schiff/Ron Silver/Teri Polo",1417478400,3,2064,5.351851851851852
8342986,5,B001U7IJS2,"This movie was underrated when it was first released, and, as with all good, underrated movies, it has since become a cult favorite. Clever and imaginative, a lot was done on a limited budget to make it into a top notch sci-fi thriller. It has an intelligent and well reasoned story, and the special effects are imaginative.
Charlie Sheen, clean and sober, plays radio astronomer, Zane Zaminski, who picks up radio signals that are not earthly. When he takes a copy of the tape of these signals, which he believes to be indicative of intelligent, alien life, to his boss, chillingly played by Ron Silver, he is summarily fired from his job. Suddenly, all is not right with the world.
Smelling something real fishy, Zane sets about investigating. A rendevous in Mexico with a fellow scientist (Lindsay Crouse), who is there on her own investigation, clues him in to the fact that she, too, has noticed something odd. Unbeknownst to both, her concerns are connected to his. Their collaborative, investigative efforts eventually prove fruitful.  He ultimately discovers an immense alien plot, and it seems that a well orchestrated invasion is imminent.
Yes, it's the old alien conspiracy story rearing its ugly head. Only this time, it is handled with surprising intelligence. Zane is now on a mission to convey what he knows to the world, but the aliens will stop at nothing to silence him. Will he make it? Watch the film and find out. If you love sci-fi films, you will not be disappointed.
Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Crouse, and Ron Silver all do a great job, which goes a long way in making this a stellar sci-fi film. The creative special effects that make the aliens just different enough are novel.  The film also boasts an excellent script. All in all, this is sci-fi as it should be.",1029715200,2,1786,4.776699029126213
