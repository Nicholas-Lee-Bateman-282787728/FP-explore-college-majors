8719513,1,B00Z710TWG,"The series is great, really funny especially if your familiar with Mexican pop culture. Unfortunately the DVD video quality is subpar compared to the previously two releases. It's obvious the files used to create the DVD's were incorrectly encoded. Comparing the version available on subscription streaming sites, this dvd has numerous video anomalies that distract from the enjoyment. Most glaring is the combing look the video has, where you can see jagged edge around the people and objects on screen. The ones available online do not have these problems suggesting the streaming sites use a different file that was provided to them from the studio than that was given to the DVD manufacturer. On my DVD player the other two releases show up as 24 frames a second where as this one shows up as 30 frames suggesting that this release was made from an interlaced version that was then converted progressive and didn't do a good job about it. Also I might add that even though the studio that produced the series is Televisa, the previous two seasons on DVD were distributed by Vivendi Universal where as this one was released by independent distributor Cinedigm, I'm assuming that's why the video anomalies might have went unoticed by the manufacturer or Televisa. So I give this release one star not for the show, which is great but for the poor video quality of the DVD's.

For those that want to know this release does not feature english subtitles, lIke the other two seasons.",1452211200,2,1481,4.853754940711463
