The outstanding jazz-flavored score for HOT ROD GIRL is by Alexander Courage, best known as composer of the theme and incidental music for ""classic""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STAR-TREK/dp/B0002I831S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STAR TREK</a>. His 17 piece band includes Bud Shank, Georgie Auld and Dave Pell on saxes, Maynard Ferguson's trumpet, guitarist Barney Kessel and Milt Holland on drums.

In a simple but effective story, Ben Martin (Connors) is a cop who convinces young road racers to exercise their lead feet and exorcise their speed demons at the San Francisco drag strip. Bronc Talbott (Andrews) is the black leather jacketed villain, a hot rodder with a long record of moving violations who comes to town and goads nave kids into street heats and ""chicken"" races.

His first victim is Jeff Northrup's brother, Steve (Erickson). Bronc rams Steve's front bumper a couple of times and succeeds in getting him to race, despite pleas from Jeff (Smith) to slow down. Steve wipes out and dies at the scene. Jeff is inconsolable; he works day and night at his mechanic's job for distraction.

Bronc's next target is class clown Flat Top (Gorshin); their 'chicken' run nearly ends in the joke being on Flat Top. Throughout all this, Jeff declines the bully's challenges and best efforts to engage him in a race, but that comes to an end on a sinuous hillside road outside of town. Their cars jockey for position. Just as Jeff crosses onto the wrong side of the street and rounds a curve he sees a boy on a bicycle who's coming right at him.

Despite a misleading title (Lori Nelson's role is a minor one), this interesting and underrated movie has good dialogue, fine music and is competently paced, directed and filmed.

1420682,3,B00005B31K,"Good cheap fun . Basic story about young people, romance, old cars, surviving bad decisions to learn valuable lessons in life. A few wild kids cause trouble for the group, someone dies young, and the rest grow up wiser and safer. A few nice old cars thrown into the mix to stir up old memories. Get some popcorn , relax and enjoy .",1265846400,2,331,4.26984126984127
1420683,1,B00005B31K,"Do yourself a favor and don't waste the few dollars it costs for this piece of crap.  I am about as liberal as it comes to bad movies, as a matter of fact, I cherish bad movies as long as I'm not bored.  Usually, the cheesier, the better.  This one is boring, and doesn't have anything to do with any girl as far as I remember.  It sucks, and the transfer is AWFUL!!!!!!!",1071100800,8,371,4.041095890410959
1420684,4,B00005B31K,"Very surprised by this one, it was great. The scripting moved quickly from one cheesy scene and line to the next. Some pretty funny characters and dialogue. One of the best [amt.] dvd deals.",998870400,7,190,4.617647058823529
1420685,1,B00005B31K,"Even wonderful B-Queen Lori Nelson (Day the World Ended, Revenge of the Creature) couldn't save this film. Even the price couldn't save it. Even an acquired nostalgia for a time I did not experience couldn't save it. Because there was nothing to save.
There is not enough offbeat campiness or histrionic overacting to make it mindless fun like some other juvenile delinquent pictures of the 50's. The kids aren't even delinquents; they just enjoy drag racing at 20 mph on suspiciously wide roads in an unnamed California town. When they really want to be antisocial they listen to a jukebox and sip malts. I don't want trash, but there's no real peril or conflict that seems like any big deal to me. It brings to mind Blackboard Jungle (overall a good film, BTW), but with even less menace. It's just too dated in that regard.
Anyway, a guy's brother is killed in one such race, and he swears off drag racing. Will he be able to resist the goading stranger clad in black leather? Will innocents be harmed by the wanton disregard of speed-crazed thrill kids? Will Chuck Connors relax his jaw muscles? No. Yes. No.
Need I continue? I will, all the same. The bad guy eventually gets caught and punished for a tragically reckless act and blatant cover-up. You can rest easy now.
Maybe this is what the 50's were really like. Pleasant enough, but nicey-nice to the point of comatose. If so, give me the souped-up brassy fictional Corman-ized view. Or Teenagers From Space. Or American Graffiti. Or Back To The Future. Heck, even Happy Days had the Fonz and a laff track.",992822400,7,1565,4.673913043478261

1420689,5,B00005B31K,"Sure it's an old movie and is nowhere near the complex movies we have today, but that's what makes it great.  It's a simple movie with a simple plot that you can set down with your kids and watch without all the foul language.  There is some great shots of old drag racers and some great old cars.  If you are buying this movie looking for a complex and twisted plot, don't buy it.  If you are wanting a classic old car movie with some period correct hot rods and drag race scenes, them this is going to fit the bill.",1388620800,2,517,4.089108910891089

1420691,2,B00005B31K,"I collect hot rod / car movies.  That being said, this just barely qualifies.  It does have some early examples of 'hot rod cars'.  It does have hot rod thugs ..... tough guys who just happen to think that they are tough because of the cars they drive.  To be honest, even in color ... this would be a so so film.  No real plot, no relatable message.  Even if you were a hot rodder in the 50's chances are this would be more a comedy, than a slice of life.  But as I said, I collect hot rod / car movies, and it does qualify as that.  Poor acting, and not a lot of cars or car action.",1382745600,3,584,3.8487394957983194

I'm a 50's movie buff about Hot Rods & early Rock n Roll Rebels Rockabilly type. One of the young characters looks like  the guy who later became known as the Riddler in the original 60's Batman series. It's a fun movie to watch.",1290816000,,397,4.1558441558441555

7936524,4,B00005B31K,"This poorly named film has little to do with girls, hot rod girls or any girls for that matter. What it has to do with is a detective's struggle to get street racers off the streets and onto the track in the early years of drag racing in an effort to save lives. Does it have cool hot rods, behind the scenes working on cars, malt shop fun and drama? You bet it does. Lets be clear, this is a typical ""B"" movie, then again, most of the hot rod flicks were with American Graffiti being one of the few exceptions. That's part of there charm. Definitely not one of the best films in the category but a must see! The film is important in several ways. First the struggle to get drag strips open and the public's unwillingness to allow them. The police trying to get the kids off the streets and onto the tracks. The early years of drag racing including safety issues like track inspections and helmets. The important issues are over shadowed in the movie but they made it into the film. As for hot rod girl, she takes a lap down the strip in a stock t-bird and then spends the rest of the movie trying to help her boy friend recover from a tragedy Don't be fooled by the misleading name, grab a coke and some popcorn and enjoy the show!  .",1433635200,2,1235,4.189075630252101

The transfer is terrible but watchable, the sound is nothing to write home about (although I am in this review) and the acting?  boy oh boy...  but it's a fun, old nostalgic movie that shouldn't be missed.  An almost impossible find to rent or see on Netflix, etc. so for fun spend the $7 and enjoy, who knows, you may like it more than your popcorn!",1423612800,,391,4.243243243243243
