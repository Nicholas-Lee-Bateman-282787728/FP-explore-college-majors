2780716,5,6303356710,"In this movie, Gene Autry plays Deputy to William Farnum.  The show is about a meat packing company who uses trucks, short wave radios and airplanes to rustle cattle.  It seems that with all the modern technology, an old fashioned sheriff has a hard time catching these rustlers and a Detective agency from the East is called in, but then thanks to his loyal deputies Gene Autry and Frog Millhouse, the sheriff's department succeeds in capturing the cattle rustlers. This movie has good music, a love story, great comedy from Smiley Burnette and plenty of action.  All in all, a great western in the unique style of most Autry Westerns.  A Western with automobiles, airplanes and plenty of modern know how. Even though a early movie in the career of Autry, it shows a star at his best!!  Highly recommended by this Autry collector, because Gene Autry was considered a Public Cowboy #1 on screen and off, from the beginning of his career to the day he left us on October 3rd, 1998!!",1045872000,,981,4.6473988439306355
2780717,4,6303356710,"Deputy Gene Autry rides to the rescue when modern rustlers use airplanes, short wave radios, and refrigerator trucks to ply their trade.  Cowboys and 1937 technology result in an ersatz era that only exists in Hollywood fiction.  Occasional chuckles are a side effect.  The leading citizens consider Gene's friend and mentor, old Sheriff Doniphan, outdated.  They hire a team of modern detectives.  Hot on the trail, the detectives' car is stuck in a stream, and their teargas grenades explode accidentally.  Gene and his cowboy pals ride through a teargas fog to bypass this obstacle in pursuit of the crooks.  Surrealism abounds.  Gene does a fair amount of singing, but lengthy musical numbers are thankfully absent.  As comic sidekicks go, Smiley Burnette leaves one yearning for Gabby Hayes.  The story includes cliff-hanging action and light humor.  The outbursts of violence are bloodless enough to be ""G"" rated.  B movie meister, Joseph Kane, directed this little flick.  Nobody made Westerns like Republic.  Great Saturday matinee fun.  ;-)",1020211200,,1049,5.2727272727272725

8181172,1,6303356710,"This is pretty awful, dated stuff. Gene Autry was apparently devoid of talent in any form unless he could ride a horse, but you'll have to ask his stand-in about that. Nevertheless, watching this type of corny, prehistoric cowboy flick is fun, and I wouldn't miss it. Now and then only, mind you.",1459209600,,296,4.60377358490566
