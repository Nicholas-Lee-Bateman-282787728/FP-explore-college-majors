5146263,4,B008BKQZNW,A movie that is all about the search for true love by a young man growing up in world which tried to make him cynical but failed. This film is populated by credible actors including Elliot's single mother and the two actors who played Elliot as a loving teenager and an adult. I am so glad I took a chance on this movie.  I promise you won't regret it either!,1355270400,8,359,4.128571428571429
5146264,5,B008BKQZNW,"Very good movie I love it.  Has a good message in the movie.
Never let go someone that cares. Sometimes life is hard to find the correct person.",1355184000,6,144,4.142857142857143
5146265,5,B008BKQZNW,"Elliot is a cute Latino 21 year old gay boy who is looking for love in New York City ...  not exactly an original concept in itself, but this film is unique in its approach and characters, making it a must-see, in my opinion.

Scenes of the current day Elliot, meeting a series of men who turn out to be shallow, not interested in a committed relationship and seemingly incapable of love, are interspersed with scenes from Elliot's childhood, growing up with a single mom who seems to be attracted to men that are no good for her or her son.  His mother's futile search for love, as well as the abuse they both suffer from one of her boyfriends, no doubt impact on Elliot's need to be securely loved and protected.

The acting is a cut above what you would expect from a low-budget indie, especially the two actors who play Elliot, as a child and young adult.  Numerous Latino actors play Elliot's friends and family, lending a realistic, warm tone to the film.  The direction is excellent, including creative touches, such as the use of animated sequences in one of Elliot's ""looking for love"" adventures and in the closing credits.  Featured at numerous film festivals, and won Best Feature at the Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival.  DVD includes commentary, extended scenes and trailer.  Not rated, but would be a light ""R"" for sexual content.  This is a positive gay portrayal that you would likely not hesitate to share with a mixed audience.  Five full stars out of five!",1353196800,19,1477,4.620689655172414
5146266,5,B008BKQZNW,"A most heart warming story of a boy, later a young man just looking to be loved.",1463702400,,80,3.764705882352941
5146267,5,B008BKQZNW,"Great film with superb acting. Meaning is not just conveyed through spoken words--body language plays a part and speaks volumes. The scene with the teacher and Elliot, for example, where she tells him his name means ""walk with God,"" the viewer can see her worried expression on her face. The teacher provided the boy with an anchor--the book--that he could fall back on in his solitude and abandonment.

The scene where his mom and her family were at the dinner table, one could see her torture as her sister called out her failures. The viewer can't help but sense that pain because we know how much she loves her son and feels like a failure that her only way out in her mind to remedy the situation is to bring a man into the house regardless of his character.

Elliot's eyes after his boyfriend tells him he wants to date a guy sitting nearby because he didn't like the idea of Elliot's declaring love after three weeks of dating, exposed his emotional grief without an utterance, culminating ultimately in a physical altercation with his boyfriend's new erotic focus--no words and yet so powerful. These are just a few scenes where non-verbal communications are so poignant. The production is loaded with them giving the film a stellar quality.

Great work of art on a limited budget--a must see.",1463616000,2,1301,4.722466960352423

5146271,5,B008BKQZNW,"A small Masterpiece: the acting was devastatingly real ,esp both ""Elliots"" and his mother; powerful performances,hilarious and heartbreaking and in the end, salvific. Elliot, ""He who walks with God"" truly understands the heart of God,by his continual decision to choose love over hatred or worse,indifference.",1445040000,3,309,5.888888888888889

5146278,5,B008BKQZNW,"I had recorded this movie, simply because I was stunned by the younger Elliots looks. He looks identical to my own 12 yr old son. I made my son watch a minute of the movie, so he could see the little boy who could be his twin. I had no idea WHAT this movie was about. My son took it upon himself to watch the whole movie, and he fell in love with it. My son is not Gay, but he does have Autism, and he really loves all the emotion, and expression in this film. He watches his favorite parts over and over. Usually, an argument, and there's plenty of those in this film. Overall, this is a sweet little film, with a great message. No matter what happens to you in life, keep your heart open, so you can give, and receive love.",1400371200,3,725,4.006896551724138
5146279,4,B008BKQZNW,"I stumbled on this little surprise on HBO in the day time. Being partially hispanic and having lived in New York, it pulled me in right away. I saw so much of myself and life in Elliott. Fabio Costaprado and the little boy that played him, were both enchanting. The young man who plays as Elliot is such a natural. He had me laughing, smiling and crying. Some parents have little clue how deep our emotions can be at a very tender age. Seor Costraprado was born to play Elliot. It was a serendipitous casting. The cast of characters coming in and out of Elliot's life are not caricatures. You can find any number of these characters in Jackson Heights or Corona or Queens Village or what is now left of Spanish Harlem. The inside jokes between Dominicans and Puerto Ricans is a very real situation between the two cultures. As much as I was aware of the ongoing riffs between the two island cultures, no one has been able to truly articulate just why this ongoing rivalry seems without ending.

And the Latin men were beyond wonderful! From the extraordinarily adorable young Elliot to Mr. Costraprado and his many corazon tugs provide endless eye candy and salutes the elated libertidad of New York summers when certain parts of the city transport you to Recife or Acension or Puerto Plata. The charming and beautiful Bonita that plays Elliot's mother is another perfect bit of casting. With a beautiful, familiar kind of face, she needs her friendship with Elliot possibly more than Elliot needs her maternal nurturing. The revolving doors of pendejos only reinforces the bond between mother and son, son and needing guidance to grow.

I identified with Elliot. In my youth, I would always be hoping ""he is the one"", only to end up disappointed or simply looking foolish.

It was a little too sobering to see how Elliot would eventually mirror his mother's poor choices in lovers and/or potential partners.",1394582400,2,1908,4.740963855421687
5146280,4,B008BKQZNW,"Not great but what is these days, this is funny and the acting isn't that bad nor did I find the writing that bad it's a funny sorry and I stayed with it until the end so I'd say get it:-)",1394323200,3,188,3.6097560975609757
5146281,4,B008BKQZNW,"Fabio Costaprado is quite a skilled young actor. Sure he's a tad rough around the edges, but in terms of capturing the youthful exuberance of Elliot and how he talks a mile a minute about himself and his life is quite endearing. He's well-cast as the young mad who seems to follow along wherever his heart leads him with little concern for the consequences. At times some of his expressions may seem almost like caricatures of real people, but then you may be forgetting that (1) this movie is still a comedy and (2) there are young men who actually behave like this.

Quentin Araujo is equally impressive in his scenes as the younger Elliot and he certainly stands toe-to-toe with Elena Goode. And given roughly half the movie is his to bring to life, I did not find myself disliking his scenes or wishing to see more of the older Elliot. Both stories remained fairly well executed.

Now in most gay movies, we're used to seeing a fair amount of skin involving ridiculously beautiful or significantly muscled individuals. In Elliot Loves, we have more ""natural"" actors cast in the movie who are still fairly attractive or the types of guys you could imagine actually getting into bed with without the need to look like they live in gyms. And I really appreciated this aspect to things - it kept the movie more focused on its story and keeping things real as opposed to casting more ""idealized"" guys that inevitably maintain a bit of distance between the viewer and the material.

The movie features both silly comedic moments (like Elliot's dance to show he's clean) and rather heavy moments (a lot of the scenes with his mother) and manages to balance the differences between the two pretty well. There are moments when you wonder why we spend more time with either the younger or the older Elliot and how it will all come together and other times you can't help but wish we didn't cut away so soon. Overall pacing of the movie was steady but slowed a bit mid-way.",1390176000,2,1966,4.611428571428571

5146285,5,B008BKQZNW,I just love Elliot Loves. I have watched it at least 5 times and love it more each time. It is very real and funny at the same time.

5146287,3,B008BKQZNW,"A young boy raised in a single parent household by a mother looking for love and not always choosing wisely, and later her son looking for love and not always choosing wisely either.  Sweet story because main characters are good hearted people.  Very romantic story of a mother and a son, both leading with their chin's in their love life, so we witness them both taking some blows.  Especially liked the sex scenes between Elliot and his lovers, where the characters seemed to genuinely like, love, lust, demonstrate affection and interest, in one another.  Well done filmmaking team.",1372377600,6,585,4.938775510204081
5146288,5,B008BKQZNW,"This movie is a course in the search for a committed love in a world of fast materialistic ""Wham, Bam, Thank You Man.""  So many men are looking for an uncommitted overnite and then gone.  This story is even more interesting in that it happens to a Latino Man in the Big Apple.  We follow the life of this young man from the time of realization of his sexual orientation through his search for a partner for a full committed relationship.  Simply put, it is a very beautiful and magnificent story.  TRUE LOVE CAN BE VERY FLEETING AND DIFFICULT, ALWAYS WORTH THE TOIL AND TROUBLE!  NJMJr.",1372118400,3,586,4.481132075471698
5146289,3,B008BKQZNW,"The story of Elliot's loves is not very complicated and told in a fairly straightforward manner. We learn of his family life (let's just say his mother is not necessarily very good as a homemaker) and of his love life (let's just say Elliot is almost as much of a failure in this area as his mother) but obligatory happy ending follows (yes, it's basically a comedy so it's not a spoiler). Small cast and minor flaws show limited budget so keep your expectations rather low.",1371945600,,474,4.523255813953488
5146290,5,B008BKQZNW,"Elliot is real, fun-loving, passionate, trusting, intelligent, loyal and tough. A young man who will do what it takes to find a healthy, loving relationship with another man. He's looking for a boyfriend and a mate. Life is hard and sometimes even quite brutal. But every time you knock Elliot down, he gets back up again! He's not capable of giving up. He loves life too much!

Elliot Loves is about relationships. There is zero camp in this film. The sex scenes are tastefully done. There is very little stereotyping. Homophobia and prejudice against LGBTQ people within and outside the Hispanic community is not addressed at all, which I see as a sign of progress. The Gay community in 2013 is finally free to exam love, commitment and the difficult process of finding a mate as heterosexuals have been doing since the birth of filmmaking in the early 1900's!

Both actors who play Elliot, one as a child, and the other as an adult do a magnificent job. They put their hearts and souls into their respective performances and it shows. I felt like I got to know them, that's how good the character development is!

Why can't Hollywood make more beautiful gay films like Elliot Loves? The good news is that HBO has bough this film and now it will be seen by millions of people around the world on cable t.v.! That's huge for a gay friendly film! To quote Bob Dylan: ""Times They are a-Changin!""

5146292,5,B008BKQZNW,"This is an excellent film that should be watched by all.  There are many messages in this film, the strongest is what happens to teenagers who give birth to kids and how the kids get raised.  Great performances by all.",1369785600,2,218,4.425
5146293,4,B008BKQZNW,"This is the story of Elliot, who was born to a mother of simple tastes that is so far as having a man in her life is concerned. She had Elliot as an unintended consequence of those tastes. We meet him as a ten year old growing up as a Dominican Republic, American in New York. Apparently Elliot is old German meaning `he who walks with God', well he is not exactly religious but he does like a man in his life, just like his mum, and he has the same problem regarding holding on to them too.

We follow Elliot in the ups and downs involved with trying to find love and it is really quite funny and touching in places. The sound levels are an issue but hardly a deal breaker and the acting is all above fine. Elliot's mate Hector played by Robin de Jesus is particularly likeable. We also have some real cringe worthy chat up lines and some minimalist bedroom antics, but nothing too full on, so if that is your thing then best to avoid.

This is an independent effort and whilst it may be apparent to the movie aficionado it does not lose any of its charm and to quote Elliot from the film - `it's tough being special', and I actually really enjoyed this despite having read some negative copy on this film. If you keep your mind well open you should be able to get something out of this rather good gay based film.",1368403200,3,1315,4.1936758893280635

5146302,4,B008BKQZNW,"every character is attractive (OK, not mom's bf), and every situation feels real.  The acting is wonderful, dialog is easy to understand, camera work is spot on.  I'm about to watch it again with the commentary track.
The movie poses wonderful questions about Elliot's identification with his feckless mother, an incompetent, selfish version of Michelle Pfeiffer's character in Married to the Mob.  What role does seductive selfish Mom and absent, selfish Dad play in Elliot's sexual orientation -- in his searching for the right guy to love, like his mother?  Realizing he is the only boy  at show-and-tell in his classroom about to present drawings of women's dresses rather than of sports gear, Elliot freezes.  He refuses to show and tell what he has brought.  He also freezes his identity by coming home and lying, telling mom that his pictures won a medal, to make her feel better, and to cement himself as the only real man in her life.  This is no Tennessee Williams pity-party, though.  Elliot's cheerfulness --  his true gayness -- carries him through to a better life.",1357776000,6,1079,4.911602209944752

I've encountered many guys just like him, and I honestly don't understand how they can fall in love with someone they just met. The movie is very jerky. It moves from past to present, back and forth. I think it would have been better for the first half or the first third to have been Elliot in the past, and then moved to the present for the last half or so. I've seen a lot of gay films, and Elliot Loves is probably one of the weakest I've seen. It has its merits, but not enough for me to recommend it.",1357344000,2,653,4.030769230769231

Attempting to fill that empty gap by giving and offering, filling that gap with physical pleasures and a facade of happiness, yet never truly filling that gap at all.  Elliot hides his pain behind his search for love. The young Elliot had some of the best, funniest lines. When Elliot did find love, it did not find him. The viewers thought it did, but bad experiences on his lover's part, led to a paranoia about falling again, that said , ""not one more time."" I felt Elliot's paid when that happened. The movie took us on quite a journey between Elliot and his mother. Glad to see them end, the way it ended.

8526645,3,B008BKQZNW,Mixed feelings. The kid is great. The cast overall is good. The story wanders and the adult central character is not always sympathetic- his dysfunction sometimes makes it hard to engage with the film. I suspect it is more directing/script than the actor. The story line wandered around a bit. The final maturation of the central character read a bit hollow. I didn't see what really caused it. It would have made more sense for him to discover his long suffering friend than to fall for another fantasy person- perhaps he lives up to the fantasy but it kind felt more like an extension of the previous psychosis rather than growth. So the end fell a little flat for me. But there is some nice scene work among the actors.,1464566400,,722,4.561538461538461
