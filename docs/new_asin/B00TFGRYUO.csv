8701511,4,B00TFGRYUO,"Don't judge a DVD by it's cover in this case, because the artwork doesn't reflect Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (MQH) very well. In this first of three Mythica movies, the woman front and center on this DVD cover is indeed the protagonist, but she is a magic user who wields no swords. Ignore everything else except for that ogre on steroids in the background. ** Note: this particular release of the movie is on a Region 2 disc. You can find the Region 1 DVD release on Amazon, it's just not on this page **

The total budget is unknown to me, but 1,527 backers pledged $94,294 on Kickstarter towards the production of Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (MQH). Even if the total cost ended up as high as $3M, that's still a paltry sum for a movie that requires shoots in semi-remote locations, special effects in numerous scenes, and the creation of specialized sets, props, and costumes. The 1st Hobbit flick (2012) had an estimated budget of $180M, which is maybe 60-150x the price tag of MQH. Was the 1st Hobbit flick 100x better than MQH? Not by a longshot. That said, don't buy into MQH if you expect anywhere near Peter Jackson quality, obviously.

THE GOOD
 Cinematography. Waaaay better than expected. Not super-creative, but someone knew what they were doing behind a camera.
 Locations. Utah is not only a poor man's New Zealand, it's a fairly spectacular place to shoot this genre.
 Actors. Christopher Robin Miller (Hammerhead), Adam Johnson (Thane) and Nicola Posener (Teela) have numerous previous credits to their names, and relative newcomer Melanie Stone (Marek) did an admirable job as the lead. Thane was added to the story in a clever manner and remained likable; Marek and Teela are foxy without wearing clichd skimpy high fantasy garb.
 The soundtrack. Yeah, it's a bit high-flown for a B movie, but it's surprisingly inspired.
 Special effects / CGI. Yes, I'm on record here as saying the effects were decent *given the budgetary constraints*
 No dragon. Thank gods, I'm bloody well tired of dragons.
 The ""To Be Continued"" at the end is actually a truthful statement (there's a completed sequel and another in post-production).

THE BAD
 Despite occasional inspiration in the script and character development, MQH doesn't challenge the audience. The dialogue was ho-hum, with far more misses than hits in the humor dept.
 Generic plot. Rescue this or that person, run away, get caught, escape...
 Combat. It's clear the crew was lacking an experienced fight choreographer. Personally, this didn't much matter to me since I often find melee combat tedious no matter what, but I know this can be a deal-breaker for some viewers.
 Kevin Sorbo. Not that he was bad in MQH, he just wasn't necessary. I hope he did that cameo as a favor to the filmmaker rather than getting paid like $2k for the part so that he could remodel one of his bathrooms.
 At times MQH seems to be pandering by trying to emulate the vibe of Peter Jackson films. Perhaps this is simply homage (if so, then ignore my complaint).

THE UGLY
 The dialogue was occasionally cringeworthy rather than just bland.
 The dwarf (Hammerhead). Someone must have insisted that a high fantasy movie needs a dwarf... which is, of course, a completely ridiculous notion (see above, ""pandering to Peter Jackson fans"").

If you understand budgetary limitations in filmmaking of this kind, then you should be able to appreciate MQH and maybe even have fun. If you can't abide non-multiplex flicks, then skip this.",1440979200,6,3478,4.854483925549915
