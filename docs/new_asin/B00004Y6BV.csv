7926691,5,B00004Y6BV,I'm the one typing the review for this video but it's my 5 year old and 2 year old sons who should be the judge.  The fact that they have spent hours in front of the TV set watching this over and over and over again will tell you what they think of it. They love it and ask literally every single day to watch it (and since we've owned it for over a year - that's ALOT)! I have 3 young boys (the other one is 6 months) and I'm not embarassed to admit that sometimes I just need to plant them in front of the TV where I know they will stay if I need to get something necessary accomplished. This video allows me to do that. I would say that it's somewhat educational as well.  I've learned things that I've never known about train yards! I sit here at work and the theme song runs through my mind too often but when I start singing the words to my boys they laugh and sing along.  I'd rather my boys watch a video like this than some of the violent and gross cartoons that are shown on TV.  I recommend it for ages 15 months and older especially if your children are really into trains or even big machines.,1124928000,2,1106,3.990950226244344
7926692,5,B00004Y6BV,"My 3 year old son and I are systematically going through every video about trains that we can possibly find, so I have seen quite a few of them. I resisted checking this one out because we had already seen Mighty Machines at the Airport and weren't impressed. I didn't have high hopes for Mighty Machines at the Train Yard.

What a pleasant surprise. This video is really well done. The premise behind the Mighty Machines videos is that footage of vehicles are overdubbed with human voices who explain what they are doing. In the Train Yard video, none of the voices are annoying, and Shunty (the ""lead"" narrator) sounds like a child (girl or boy? not clear), which my son really responds to.

Don't look for any steam trains or passenger trains in this video. This one is devoted to modern diesel freight trains and modern trainyards. I really didn't expect it to be interesting. Most kids gravitate toward steam trains. Who knew that the work-a-day life of a diesel could be so interesting?

The video features footage and explanations about how freight cars are moved around in a train yard and arranged to form trains. We also learn how the cars are loaded as a shipment of *chocolate* gets put on board (nice touch). Later in the video we see how an auto rack car is unloaded (the cars are circa 1980s). The segment that mezmerizes everyone in the family is about the tie gang that repairs the tracks. It's a long segment, but the machines are really cool and unlike anything most of us have ever seen. The scale, power, and specialization of these machines really amazes me.

As another reviewer noted, this video is not terribly fast paced, but it is surprisingly engaging. The theme song sounds like a Chevy commercial and gets a little grating after repeated viewings, but it isn't unbearable. There are no previews, but clips from all the videos in the series are shown during the intro song. I'd recommend this video for ages 2-8, and it would be especially appropriate for a child who knows someone that works in a train yard.",1095984000,2,2038,4.637119113573407
7926693,4,B00004Y6BV,"This video had to grow on both me and my son.  What I like about is the slow pace, which allows him to actually stay focused.  Also, no fast animation like many of today's kid's videos;  real time, real life.  I must repeat that this video took a while to grow on me, but my father who worked for the old Rock Island Railroad for over 30 years loved it!  Him and my son (his grandson) love to watch this video in the den together and take a nap.  Just to see that is worth four stars!  Recommended viewing for children, parents, and even grandparents!",1053820800,,551,4.190476190476191
