Clearly presented in a well thoughtout formate this dvd is both visually pleasing as well as supportive in its use of imagery. Highly informative yet simply presented, as a result of watching this dvd my life and understanding of the role diet and food choices play in my health, healing and living. In my opinion this dvd should be given to anyone who's health is less perfect or who may be seeking greater vitality in their day to day expereince of life.
Bravo to the film makers for their presentation and thank you to the good Doctor for sharing this most important information.",1254182400,,728,4.473684210526316
