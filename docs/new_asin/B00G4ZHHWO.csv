8620816,5,B00G4ZHHWO,"Kind Hearts and Coronets is without doubt one of the finest, drollest British black comedies to come out of the post-WW2 Ealing Studios era.  It features a star-turn by Alec Guinness as eight (count 'em!) different murder victims, all members of the same British aristocratic family.  Although Guinness' performances are the film's high point, Dennis Price as the narrator/perpetrator and Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson as his two ""love"" interests also do spectacular, stylish work, and tie the entire film together admirably.  Also excellent is Miles Malleson, whose brief portrayal as the hangman bears an occasional, uncanny resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock.  The humor is literate, eloquent, and completely deadpan, and the ending is one of the all-time best surprises to be pulled off in a motion picture prior to The Sting.

To date, there is no Region A release of KH&C available and none appears to be in sight.  For people who are already fans and who are looking for a Blu-ray copy, but who might be leary of ordering an imported Spanish release, all I want to say is ""not to worry.""  The disc is Region A/B/C compatible.  The undubbed, unsubtitled English original is easily accessed once you learn to navigate the Spanish language settings (not hard).  The print itself is in generally excellent shape, and the Blu-ray transfer shows only a few instances of edge shimmering.  The audio has a slightly boxy sound to it that I don't remember from the previous DVD release, but none of this should be considered a deal breaker.  If a domestic company should make a new, thoroughly restored version of this delicious little classic available sometime in the future, I'll be more than happy to look into it.  In the meantime, this current disc should fill the bill nicely.",1498608000,,1781,4.959595959595959
