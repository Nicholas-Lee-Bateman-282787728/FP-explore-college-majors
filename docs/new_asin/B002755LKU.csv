8353977,2,B002755LKU,"This was a film that I watched based purely on the synopsis; which sounded totally off the wall and interesting. Every now and again a super low budget indie film will fly way under the radar and end up being a gem... this is not one of those movies. I have no problem with the production value at all, this movie wasn't good because of the way the story was told and the acting. The premise was so cool and promising as the springboard for a quirky dark comedy, but instead it turned into an incomprehensible mess.

The film ends up being overly confusing and convoluted... it just loses its way after about twenty minutes. Additionally some of the acting was quite suspect. Normally I'm not one to complain about acting, but a few spots of blatant cringe-inducing overacting forced me to take note. Such a disappointment, it's really too bad because this one could have been special if done right. 2/5 stars.",1294272000,,910,4.58282208588957
