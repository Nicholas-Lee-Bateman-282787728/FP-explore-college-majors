807533,5,6304211902,"Definitely a keeper in the family movie collection. I had already seen the movie and decided to buy it and so when pucrhasing at Amazon I was so surprised at a few poor reviews listed for this movie that I took time to write. It is a great production of a family favorite depicting old time values and morals while entertaining due to engrossing and almost believable characters of this old family favorite. My 6 and 5 yr old kids were enthralled and describe it as their favorite movie ever. Even Dad stayed awake through the entire movie! It may not work for teenagers but for a relaxing family movie evening, you will not be disappointed and I will keep our copy for ever.",1101859200,15,675,4.451612903225806

807535,4,6304211902,"I asked for this movie in 1996 because I was a HUGE Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan.
When I first watched it, I was expecting it to be a lot like the animated Disney version.  To a certain extent it is, but there are a lot of scenes in this movie that aren't in the animated version.
What I Didn't Like About the Movie: With live action and JTT's likeness as a puppet, I got a ""Toystory"" / ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit Feel"".  It just didn't look right.  This is minor considering the overall quality of the story.
I did enjoy this movie. It doesn't have content that you have to worry about little ones seeing. Though it isn't destined to be a Disney classic, this is a good movie for the whole family.",1073692800,9,694,4.203007518796992

807699,3,6304211902,Unfortunately this DVD release from New LIne suffers from a time gone by. At the time it was released 4:3 analogue screens were the norm so it was released as 2.35:1 letterboxed in a 4:3 frame. To get the correct ratio on a new widescreen TV you have to set it to 4:3 and have bars all round (waste of TV screen) or use the zoom function. With DVD resolution the zoom ain't that great on the big screen! Not New Line Fault but this does need a re-release (preferably BD).,1426550400,,471,4.186813186813187

He makes a puppet out of a tree that he had carved a heart into long ago.  He names the puppet Pinocchio because it is made of pine.  The log he used was magical and the puppet came to life.  Pinocchio wants desperately to be a real boy for his papa.  He has to prove himself worthy of being a real boy.  He get's into trouble and his conscience has to get him out.  If he lies his nose grows, sometimes it get's so long it grows leaves and has a birds nest on it.  He makes a bad decision and gets donkey ears and a tail.  Him and his papa get swallowed up by a wale and he needs to tell lies to make his nose grow to get them out.  Eventually he becomes a real boy and they live happily ever after.",1307664000,,862,3.7541899441340782

807841,1,6304211902,"This movie is totally unlike all of the other Pinocchio movies I have ever seen. It didn't follow the Pinocchio theme and wasn't really about honesty. If you like the story of Pinocchio, the original version is the best.",1192838400,,220,4.666666666666667
807842,1,6304211902,I watched most of this movie with a Kindergarten class as a substitute teacher.  I found it totally inappropriate for children and was shocked to see that it was rated G.  It has many very dark scenes and a considerable amount of violence as well as several sexually suggestive scenes.  I'm sure many of the kids had nightmares after watching it.  Any parent should consider this a PG-13 film and then be cautious about kids seeing it.  For the little ones the Disney version is the way to go.,1179360000,,493,4.49438202247191
807843,4,6304211902,"Contrary to the initial review by Rochelle O'Gorman, this film is NOT for the SIMPLE-MINDED, nor is it appropriate for YOUNG viewers!!! It is for OLDER viewers and interesting only because of the ANIMATION techniques,filming in  Prague, costumes, scenery, acting, etc.  DISNEY is the only true,traditional Pinocchio---with special music, Christian theme with angels, a real friend in Jiminy Cricket, the gold fish, the cat--much more imaginative and suitable for very young children AND adults!!!",1157155200,3,496,5.6891891891891895
807844,4,6304211902,"This is one of the better ""family films"" that adults would still enjoy, and I don' mean to use that as a clich?. Suffice to say it's a fast-moving story, is creatively done and looks super on DVD. This was a stunner, visually-speaking.

The creativity - especially for a film 10 years old - involves the wonderful special-effects that make the famous wooden puppet so lifelike. I haven't seen it in eight or nine years but when this came out first on VHS I remember being shocked at the visuals and how real things looked.  The DVD enhances  it another notch.

This is not an animated film, and the story is a bit different from other versions. How faithful this is to the original story, I cannot tell you, because I never was a big fan of the story. I can tell you, however, that Martin Landau is very good playing Pinochhio's creator ""Geppetto.""

I found it interesting that the cricket in this story was called ""Pepe,"" not Jiminy Cricket. At any rate, this is a nicely-done version of the famous kids' story.",1144972800,3,1012,4.508196721311475

7864573,5,6304211902,"MOVIE:
- Best life adaptations of Pinocchio. The story was based more on the Disney version, rather than the classic tale itself. However, they managed to throw in some of the original elements that were not in the Disney movie. It's funny, charming, strange, and scary (if you really think about it and read the actual story, Pinocchio is a dark tale).
- Casting was perfect. The actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. The late Martin Landau wonderfully portrayed the warm and kind nature of Geppetto. Jonathan Taylor Thomas voiced the innocent and naive Pinocchio really well. But to me, Udo Kier stole the show as the antagonist. He's scary and manipulative, without being too over the top. And Bebe Neuwirth was beautiful and mischievous at the same time.
- Costumes, props, and setting were great. The feel of being in an old fictional Italian village was really well done.
- Music was great as well. Personally, I prefer this one to the Disney version.
- Special effects was okay. Animatronic, stop/go motion, and cgi were used. Pinocchio does seem come to life. For close-ups and full shots (simple walking), animatronic/puppet were used. While the running used stop/go motion. The cgi was the downside part of this movie. It's on the same level as Anaconda, but compare to the run-time of the movie, the usage was very minimal. So it's not that big of a deal, but can seem very cartoon-ish.
Overall, I like this one better than the Disney take.

DVD:
Not much to offer (probably because the movie itself was not well received), so don't expect much.
- Full-screen (traditional TV) and widescreen (HDTV).
- One behind the scene footage, which is really short so we don't get to see much.
- Two interactive games, but I find them to be really boring.
- New Line's film highlight (just a poster of Monkey Trouble, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Theodore Rex).
- And the standard scene selections, subtitles (English and Spanish), theatrical trailer and cast info.
- Double sided cd (side 1: full-screen version and dvd features. Side 2: widescreen version).",1509840000,,2069,4.844632768361582
