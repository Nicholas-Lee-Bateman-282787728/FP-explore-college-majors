8136896,3,6304621027,Is there a difference other than the fact its 1 tape instead of 2? well for the plot there really isn't much you have no backround on the charecters really other than the fact that the three siblings and they all go to school together,987811200,,234,4.222222222222222
8136897,4,6304621027,"In round 2 of Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer the final battle for the fate of the Earh is decided.  Earth's defenders are Isato Kaizer, Hellstinger, Kyosuke, Karin and Miss Shaia.  They are up against someone who calls  himself God, Omni Existence, and a female assassin out for revenage.  Another bonus is that Kash gets more screen time, that makes me very happy.  I like Kash.  I really, really, really like Kash.  He's clever, rationale,  handsome and looks cool.  I really love the bat wings!",957484800,3,492,4.831325301204819
