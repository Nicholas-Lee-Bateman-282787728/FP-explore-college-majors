8139732,5,B000085EEP,"I ordered this film because I love watching Adriana Ozores and Maribel Verdu. They are great talents and drop dead gorgeous. Not to mention, Spanish cinema exceeds American movies for the most part when it comes to great writing and acting. There is more honesty in the characters as well as great entertainment. This is the story of 4 women who walk completely different paths in life. Although robbing a bank is not on my list of things I approve of, it is a very funny story on how they pull it off. Great writing makes it all come together. This is a film that can be seen over and over.",1116892800,,591,4.333333333333333
8139733,5,B000085EEP,"The characters are what made this movie so much fun. A single mother cleaning lady, a punk chick, a promiscious hair stylist and a rich widow all team up to rob a bank. The crooks in this film have so much concience, and their circumstances are ones that the average person can relate to.
The dvd itself is good also as it has ""the making of"" segment, which I found to be rather humorous. The acting is great, great script, overall it is a very funny movie, its great to finally see some great comedy from Spain.",1073001600,,512,4.288659793814433
