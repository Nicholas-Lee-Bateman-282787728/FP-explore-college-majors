7455370,5,B0161H1ORS,"Great movies. Unlike some series that seem to go on and on and get dull, this keeps going bigger and better with special effects, explosions, cars, etc. First one is classic with a lot of good dialogue and mystery to the very end. Second was alright but it introduced Benji who is continued throughout the rest of the movies as the funny techie. The third one I like more every time I see it, although the part where they infiltrate the same place three or four different ways just to end up together was ridiculous. The fourth and now fifth ones I enjoy the most. I think people tend to get too critical when a series appears to drag on but the last two keeps going with entertaining characters, more mystery and all the cool action stunts.",1450656000,10,741,4.416058394160584

7455373,4,B0161H1ORS,"I was going to buy ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION"", and saw for TWICE the price, I could just upgrade them [all 5!] to Blu-ray.

BTW: I noticed only three of the seven reviewers actually HAVE this collection, so, I'll let you know right now, these FIVE BDs come in one
of those horrible--cardboard and glued plastic---tri-fold holders with SLOTS. That is, if you want movie #5, you remove it like any OTHER
push and press spindle-post. If you want disc # 2 or #4, you push the spindle post and set disc #1 or #3 someplace else. Then, carefully,
push and press, while sliding the disc away and down from its holder. Re-insert the disc you DIDN'T want, and do the process, reversed, to
get back to ""normal"" again...after you see the disc you WANTED in the first place.
Oh! Read my headline for another problem with t-h-i-s, heavier, unusual disc holder. And, YES!, I prefer those REGULAR disc holders!

SHORT 'n' SWEET 'n' S-O-U-R:

B-A-D NEWS==> The first t-h-r-e-e movies are just---2006---ten-year-old [re-packaged] Blu-Rays of current DVD-quality with subtitles,
and, 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, in ENGLISH; FRENCH; and SPANISH. In fact, the video quality is actually WORSE than many HD-DVDs
MI:III's Blu-ray disc actually says ""disc #1"" on it!

GOOD NEWS==> MI:4 is ENGLISH 7.1 DOLBY TRUE HD; FRENCH; PORTUGUESE; and SPANISH 5.1 DD.
"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ==> MI:5 is ENGLISH DOLBY ATMOS (backward compatible to 7.1/5.1 Surround Sound); French/Spanish/Portuguese:5.1 DD.

There A-R-E other collections of the, previous, THREE and FOUR of the franchise's movies' collections, but, many of the reviews mention
that the Blu-ray mastering of the---first three---movies were inadequate in, both, audio a-n-d video.

The reviews, I've read, OFTEN mention ""only the fourth movie LOOKED like an actual Blu-ray"". And, indeed, the sound, come up short

7455427,5,B0161H1ORS,"This is the Mission: Impossible blu-ray bundle you will want to buy!

I highly recommend this particular combo pack if you want to watch every movie in the franchise.

It is a fantastic deal as far as I'm concerned. I got every single Mission: Impossible movie that is out on blu-ray with this bundle. It is a fairly reasonable price considering you are getting all 5 of the movies in the series for essentially the price of one.

As far as the quality of the movies in the series, they are all worth a watch for their high entertainment and replay value. Tom Cruise is the greatest action star of all time and this series proves why. The movies continue to get better as they go along. Mission: Impossible has replaced James Bond for spy movies and replaced every other action franchise for thrills.

7455461,5,B0161H1ORS,"My family enjoyed this set of 5 Mission Impossible Movies. The BluRay disks audio worked perfectly on our stereo that is connected to our hi-resolution digital projector. Watching a film on a 12 foot diagonal screen with a good sound track is like going to the movies. We just break out the popcorn and enjoy the movies.

These films were all entertaining with a lot of action. We got a great video picture and good sound. We also submitted the digital movie codes and we had no problem in getting the movies in VUDU HDX quality. It makes it nice as we can stream the movies to any of our ROKUs to our TVs or to our digital projector without looking for the disks. It makes it extremely easy to use your movie library. We can even watch the movies on our Apple iPhones, iPads and Android products.

We enjoyed the films and we have no complaints about the BluRay discs or the digital video copies. We liked all of the films but we thought that the Mission Impossible 2 film was not the same quality as the other 4 films.

This was a good buy and we rated it at 5 stars.",1520985600,19,1069,4.25615763546798

FYI: These are ""multi-format"" discs which also have the SD versions which should work in older DVD players too.

7455638,5,B0161H1ORS,"5 Blu-ray discs of some very fun, even great movies for $40, that includes the most recent Mission: Impossible installment?  Made me willing to go back and revisit the series and feel like I got my moneys worth.  And after watching all of the movies again in order Id have to say that my favorites in descending order are:

5) Mission: Impossiblethe first was a confusing crucible of tension by master Brian De Palma that gave up at the end and turned into a ridiculous helicopter chase.  But who can forget that Pentagon break-in?
4) Rogue Nationthe first two acts were a bit dry overall but the third cleaned up satisfactorily.  And Rebecca Ferguson stunned in that yellow dress.
3) IIIwho would have thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman would have made such a delightful villain?  This one was personal.
2) IIwhile I admit that this one hasn't aged well in many respects (choppy editing; too much John Woo iconography in it) its still a fun fast thrill ride with a great soundtrack and a great Dougray Scott playing Sean Ambrose, another antagonist agent who is almost as good as Cruises Ethan Hunt.  Nice cat-and-mouse play with the winsome Nyah (Thandie Newton) caught in the middle.
1) Ghost Protocoldirector Brad Bird (The Incredibles) doesnt miss a beat as he introduces a new and highly capable IMF crew (including actors Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Paula Patton) to add nuance to masterspy Hunt.  The action, the pacing, the humor, and the twists all are on fire in one of the most satisfying action movies ever made.",1474070400,,1529,4.765151515151516

Would highly recommend these movies if you like action adventure/spy thriller/Tom Cruise movies.

Again would highly recommend these movies or this box set. AWESOME!!!",1452816000,,470,4.674698795180723
