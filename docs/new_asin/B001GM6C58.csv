3615491,3,B001GM6C58,Many people may not like these TV Movies but Chuck is one of those Actors to me that is just fun to watch anywhere anytime.,1362268800,,123,3.96
3615492,4,B001GM6C58,"If you like Chuck Norris, you will like this TV Movie.  He has a knack of always knowing what to do in any situation.  As a fellow martial artist, I appreciate all of the different training techniques and styles demonstrated in this one.",1352160000,,237,4.488372093023256
3615493,4,B001GM6C58,"What can you expect?  It's a 2 pack of Chuck Norris made-for-TV movies.  Think ""Walker: Texas Ranger"" without the cowboy hat.  Much more family friendly than Chuck's earlier movies, not as violent.  There is no Lone Wolf McQuade here, but I know that my son and I can sit and watch them, be entertained and not have to worry about an ugly scene.",1321833600,2,345,4.428571428571429
3615494,4,B001GM6C58,I love Chuck Norris and the character he plays is full of action and integity. He is a man for men. The double feature is a treat. The only disappointment is the young man from the first film is not back for the second. The movies are full of action and twisted plots. They are great for an afternoon to enjoy kick them in the teeth action and close shaves.,1271203200,,357,4.114285714285714
3615495,5,B001GM6C58,I have been a great fan of Chuck Norris for a long time and really appreciated being able to buy a copy of a made- for-Tv movie I couldn't find anywhere else.  It arrived here as scheduled and in great condition. Thanks.,1229990400,5,220,4.238095238095238

3615499,5,B001GM6C58,When it comes to Chuck Norris it's difficult to find entertainment which is better. This movie and the other President's Man are excellent examples of just this type of excellence! I only wish that he would make The President's Man 3! Hopefully he would consider such a undertaken!,1401926400,,281,4.875
3615500,5,B001GM6C58,"This was a very good, action packed sequel. However, I enjoyed the first one better. This film had two annoying songs but other than that I enjoyed it. There was plenty of action, (fighting, explosions) mixed with humor. The villains were evil and intended on blowing up innocent American citizens. Joshua McCord (Norris) was supposed to retire at the end of part one but if he retired there would be no sequel. I love movies like this because it mixes humor,action, stunts, karate kicks and explosions with skill. Recommend for all Chuck Norris fans. This is a TV movie.",1394755200,,571,4.777777777777778
3615501,1,B001GM6C58,"One of the saddest excuses for a film I have seen, ever. To each his own; if you liked it great, it was the saddest acting I have seen.",1377216000,,135,3.689655172413793

3615504,5,B001GM6C58,I received it more quickly than expected. The movies that Chuck Norris made are good. I know there will always be lots of action. The quality of the DVD was very clear. I have no complaints .,1371945600,,191,4.1891891891891895
3615505,3,B001GM6C58,"Okay, I'm a big Chuck Norris fan. His movies are fun to watch. Sure they come close to being about  as violent as you can get but it's all in fun. Isn't it? It isn't? Well, if you like Chuck Norris but disdain the violence, fighting and death, here's a couple somewhat mellow ones for you. Perhaps, I should be right up front. This double feature DVD (""The President's Man and The President's Man 2: A Line in the  Sand"") is only a weak imitation of Chuck Norris movies. I gather they were done as TV Movies and had  to be ""family friendly."" Alas, you see, I should have read my Amazon reviews. I was just browsing the bargain DVD bins and spotted this Norris double feature item. Of course, I picked it up in an instant because all the other Norris sagas have been so good. Bummer. What a letdown! But, if you're specifically looking for a toned-down Norris movie, then this could be fine.

In these two movies, Norris is cast as the protector and defender of  the President of the U. S. A.  Real lofty role, a noble effort, even for Chuck Norris. But wait! He's retiring. Who is going to be the next President's Man? The suspense is crushing. Will it be Candidate #1, in the first movie or Candidate # 2 in the second. Sorry, I can't remember their names. That's how big of an impression they left on me. Well since they are being groomed to step in as the successor, they both take a frontal role in their respective movies and let Norris, now a grandfatherly type, stand in the background and make sure everything is all right and that the trainees are learning their craft.  B-O-R-I-N-G-!  Sorry, but I wanted Chuck Norris movies and these are just pale imitations. Norris even looks embarassed in some of the scenes. Okay, there was a bit of well done martial arts fighting and a certain amount of toned-down violence here and there.  Yaawwwnnnn!!!  I tire just thinking about it. Hey, these aren't really all that bad as run-of-the-mill movies, but I was expecting better. Lets have some truth in packaging. This DVD needs a Warning Label. CAUTION; These are Made For TV Movies, and should not be mistaken for the real thing.

8305990,5,B001GM6C58,"The President's Man was released in 2000. It starred Chuck Norris with great support from Marla Adams as the First Lady. When she is kidnapped the action begins. The President'a Man 2 : A Line In The Sand was released in 2002. It starred Chuck Norris. A fine sequel, with Chuck fighting terrorists. Two great action films that were made for television. Fans of Chuck Norris will like this the most.",1502236800,,398,4.619718309859155
