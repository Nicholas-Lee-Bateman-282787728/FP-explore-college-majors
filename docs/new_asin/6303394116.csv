7845246,4,6303394116,"This video is the third in a 10-video set documenting Rock `n' Roll in America.  It's very entertaining and informative.

The video begins in Liverpool, with glimpses of the Beatles' stomping grounds and their triumphal welcome in New York in 1964.  Their success led to the swell of other British bands--the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, among others--most of whom epitomized rock's roots better than many American bands.

Despite the provocative title, there was no conflict when American bands ""fought back.""  The American bands featured in the video--the Byrds, the Temptations, the Supremes, the Beach Boys--all loved the excitement of the British invasion.

Like the other videos, this series benefits from fantastic interviews by Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Brian Wilson, Mick Jagger, and other firsthand performers, and is supported by edited vintage clips of the great bands.  It could use some narration, however.

My favorite parts of this video are the old clips of the Stones--for some reason, old clips of Mick Jagger in performance are full of unintentional comedy for me.",1102464000,3,1095,5.289017341040463
7845247,5,6303394116,"In this video you can find a well extracted review of the English groups that arrived to US and started to *invade* US charts in the 60s. It starts with the Beatles (of course!) and then goes to the Seekers,the Stones,Herman's Hermits,The Hollies,the Animals,the Who,the Kinks and Gerry and the Pacemakers,among others. Then the American *fight back* with groups like the Supremes,the Temptations,the Byrds,the Lovin' Spoonful,the Beach Boys and Mamas and the Papas. This video shows you the swinging atmosphere of competition between all these groups to be at the top and shows how England was the center of the universe in the sixties talkin' about music and fashion...US had to answer... This is a great documental with awesome briefs of videos of the groups.  I think the only groups that are afwul missed here are the British Small Faces and the Yardbirds and the American Monkees.",977443200,18,886,5.0272108843537415
