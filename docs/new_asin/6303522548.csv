682948,3,6303522548,"I bought this opera and felt that I got burnt.  So this is intended as a warning.  Rossini's 'Serious"" operas are pretty hard for me to take and unless the singing is truly superb, I find them intolerable.  They tend to be a long series of routine arias with little action or possibility for action.  The men sang well enough, though their parts were relatively minor.  Azema (Young-Ok Shin) was so good that I wanted to hear more.  But while the title role was sung adequately though in a mannered and occasionally annoying style, the real problem in my ear was the major role of Arsace (Marilyn Horne).  The vocal quality was very nasty to my ear and the wobble and inaccuracies in pitch were completely intolerable.  Since this a major role, it is impossible to avoid listening to this role.  I have trashed my copy and, unless you are a real fan of the principle singers, I don't believe it is worth buying.  If Arsace and Semiramide are singing in the Bel Canto style, then this is a style to avoid at all costs.",1008115200,2,1017,4.448648648648649
682949,5,6303522548,"As a life long opera fan, but only familiar with Semiramide from various excerpts I came to this DVD ready to rate it somewhere below The Barber in enjoyment.
Boy was I wrong!!  The costumes, sets and musical tour de force quite blew me away.
Marilyn Horn, June Anderson, Samuel Ramey and especially the Met Orchestra were in top form.  Not only is this DVD in wide screen format, but it is an enhanced format for large screen tv's, so that the picture is not all crammed down to the middle.
The surround-sound is excellently accomplished, with the orchestra being featured not over and above the singers, but in combination with them.  I totally enjoyed this performance, which proved to be a typical Metropolitan Opera show.  In other words -- The best that you'll see anywhere.
If you don't have ANY other opera in your collection, I would highly recommend this one as the one to get for visually stunning costumes, tremendous sets, great singing, and great orchestral support",991872000,35,979,4.775147928994083
682950,5,6303522548,"Despite what Amazon.com says about this DVD, it is indeed widescreen. The aspect ratio is 1.78:1 for you technos out there.
Other than that note, I can't really add much else to the other reviews. This performance was wonderful. 220 minutes of Rossini bliss! Mercifully, the audience makes very little noise which helps the viewer get lost in the performance. The digital sound quality was excellent, as was the picture for the most part. Lighting could have been a bit brighter throughout - this seems to be a pervasive problem on these live recordings.
I should note that this DVD did not play well on my computer's DVD drive, but worked OK on my television's DVD player.",984441600,10,673,4.760683760683761
682951,5,6303522548,"This recording of Semiramide captures an all-star cast of Rossini specialists all in good voice and clearly ""on"" for the evening's performance.  There are some glorious examples of duet singing for the soprano and mezzo executed with brilliance and style by June Anderson and Marilyn Horne.  I own a CD recording of this opera with Marilyn Horne made back in the 1960s.  The quality of Marilyn Horne's singing in the DVD makes it hard to believe that some 30 years separates her audio recording and this taped performance at the Met! Having seen this production of Semiramide at the Met (unfortunately with a different cast) the DVD captures the lavish scenery and costumes of the opera production well.  The tracking on the DVD is well done and permits one to skip through the entire performance and get all major segments of music (arias, ensembles, etc.) with relative ease.  The special features could stand to be beefed up some more but the ability to turn the multi-language subtitles on and off is an added bonus Iuseful.  The other (minor) draw back I noticed was that in certain scenes, the reflection of the opera house lights off of certain character's costumes (i.e., Semiramide's crown) in several scenes created a split-second glare that was distracting at times.  Despite this, I still give this five stars and would more than tolerate that minor distraction for the quality of picture and clarity of the DVD provided.  Overall, a good addition to anyone's home viewing opera collection.  With the aid of surround sound speakers as part of a home theater system, this DVD is the next best thing to actually seeing the performance live.",977961600,17,1650,4.906474820143885
682992,2,6303522548,"I bought this many years ago when it first came out as a DVD; and have just had another watch of it for the first time since then.  I do not think that my impression has changed.

There is beautiful bel canto music.  The four principals ( Anderson, Horne, Ramey and Olsen) sing extremely well, the orchestra is very good also; and the production is a delight from that point of view.

But the production is pure Metropolitan Opera as it was:  expensive and lavish set and costumes; scores of chorus members who stand around and do not know what to do with themselves; stand, watch the conductor and deliver singing from the principals.  Very very dated

The only acting is from the histrionic audience who bellow and shriek at length to show how much more they appreciate what is happening on stage than anyone else.  Fortunately there is the mute and/or skip buttons on the remote.

I think that Image (the company that released this) has moved away from opera releases.  That is a good thing because, like Kultur DVD's, the production values are substandard.

But, as the gambler said:  ""I know the game is crooked, but it is the only one in town"".  This is the only DVD of Semiramide.  Buy it for the music if you cannot find a better CD.",1278115200,5,1241,4.482142857142857
682993,3,6303522548,"Beautiful production most likely put together for Marilyn Horne.
After all they through Joan Sutherland under a bus let's do something for Horne!
Horne slightly beyond her peek but still riveting as the centerpiece of this production.
Anderson sings nicely but a bit colorless. She's a beautiful woman still there's nothing in her performance that suggests she's capable of murder. The duets are somewhat anti climatic.
Samual Ramey is golden age. All in all not to be missed for Ramey, Horne and the great Rossini.",1258243200,2,515,5.070588235294117
682994,5,6303522548,"This has become my favorite opera, mainly because of this performance.  Every character is superbly played.  The music is a beautiful as can be imagined.  Sanford Olson has one of the greatest tenor voices I have ever heard and his role is magnificent.",1178496000,,252,4.813953488372093
682995,4,6303522548,"Most listeners would agree, I think, that ""Semiramide"" is an opera whose success in performance rests almost exclusively on the singers of its two leading roles. So difficult are these roles that the opera is almost never done. In the 60's, though, first in Los Angeles in a concert version, and then in the 70's at the Chicago Lyric in a fully staged production, the opera was unforgettably brought back into the repertoire by the spectacular Joan Sutherland and the incomparable Marilyn Horne. With typical slowness of response during that time, the Met ignored their triumphs. By the time the Met did get around to staging the work, Sutherland had already stopped performing the title role, and Horne, who was cast, nevertheless was nearing the end of her own Rossini singing.
Nonetheless, this Met version preserved on DVD still has merits. Horne, for instance, is disappointing in spots only by comparison with her own earlier freer-voiced and more astonishingly ornamented performances. June Anderson, singing the title role, is fully competent, but her performance is more competent than memorable. Nothing in her coloratura fireworks or legato singing could be called truly ravishing here.
Samuel Ramey, as expected, gives a fine performance, but the opera does not rise or fall based on his role.
In conclusion, it is disappointing that no videotaped or DVD performance of this rarely done opera exists with Sutherland and Horne in their glorious primes. What we have instead is this good performance (4 stars), but one which must fall short of the mark for those in Los Angeles or Chicago who experienced great ones.",1165795200,8,1626,5.093632958801498
682996,5,6303522548,"Whew!  I watched it standing up, sitting down, piecemeal, while making decaf and just glancing at the subtitles (which were sparse anyway).  This thing was interminable!  But it was also absolutely beautiful.  I've never heard anything like it.  I've got Sutherland on CD, so already knew I liked it.  But this was beyond all expectations.  When the 3 principles got together for trios (or duets or solos), they blew me away.  I liked the plot which even the idiotic Amazon staff reviewer was glad to tell you all about in case you hadn't seen it before and don't like surprises.  What a dunderhead!  This is in my opinion the jewel of Rossini's career (and the only opera by him that I've heard that I like, I greatly dislike the little artificial vibrato he invented and used incessantly), just as Una voce... is the jewel of Barber.  This opera was pure bel canto, a coloratura's dream, and Horne and Anderson milked it for all it was worth.  Incidentally, only once, at the end of a choral piece, did Anderson end up, with a Sutherland up to the balcony leap.  It was a great disappointment to me, with that music and that voice that she didn't do it more often.  I might as well have been listening to Caballe.  If you've got the stamina for a 3 and 1/2 hour opera however glorious, I overwhelmingly recommend this opera and this production of it.  Also, for what it's worth, the costumes and colors were beautiful too.  The scenery was as spare as the subtitles.  I wish people would stop giving away plots, fortunately I watched the show before I read the reviews.  It's such a jerky thing to do.",1139529600,6,1603,4.541958041958042
682997,3,6303522548,"The sets and backdrops are up to Met standards, i.e., gorgeous and sumptuous. I have no reason to complain about the music and singing. Horne's deep voice is stunning in its power--more on the other aspects later. I haven't heard Anderson before, but her singing here gives me no reason to doubt promo claims that she IS Semiramide.
Alas, as drama this performance left me unmoved. Two huge problems: there is no way costumes and headdresses can tart up Horne to be a young pubescent warrior about to take over the throne of the greatest world power of its day. I realize this is partly Rossini's fault requiring a female voice, but Horne is too short, too fat, too old--in a word, too matronly.
Second big problem: Anderson can't act. In the ghost scene at the end of Act one, she is supposed to be acting horrified. Instead, her gestures and expressions are standard operatic, ""oh poor pitiful me."" The opera is full of opportunities for subtle psychological games by Semiramide: cunning, betrayal, lust, greed, revived maternal love. She only gives us pointing, heart grasping, throat clutching gestures. Yuk. I've watched enough opera on video to know that there are plenty of great singers who are also great actors. The only exception is at the beginning of Act 2, with Ramey as Asshur. It is as if Ramey's maleness brings out her female wiles--for about five minutes.
Apparently, this opera is meant to be heard rather than seen.

682998,5,6303522548,"This DVD of Semiramide is fantastic!!  The singing and the music were very beautiful.  June Anderson is a great Semiramide, and Marilyn Horne with a beautiful mezzo-voice was amazing as Arsace.
The rest of the cast was incredible!!  You should get this DVD because the music of Rossini was beautiful.  It's the best!!",1051056000,8,317,4.9245283018867925
682999,5,6303522548,"Samuel Ramey's international career began in earnest when he sang the role of Assur in Rossini's ""Semiramide"" at the 1980 Aix-en-Provence Festival.  Two of his co-stars were no slouches, either:  Marilyn Horne and Montserrat Caball.
Horne and Ramey both repeat their roles in this 1990 New York Metropolitan Opera version of Rossini's last great dramatic opera, with Horne singing the trousers role of the young hero, Arsace.  This is the opera video I'm going to wear out first because the singers are so perfectly cast (and because I'm a Rossini nut).  Luckily, I've got a second copy.
I also have a video of the Aix-en-Provence ""Semiramide,"" but the tenor was terrible and the costumes were atrocious--almost everyone was dressed up to look like chunks of ancient Assyrian architecture (perhaps because the soprano resembled a chunk of ancient Assyrian architecture, even without a costume). I'd give Caball the edge over June Anderson vocally, but dramatically Anderson is 'the' personification of the flamboyant Met Semiramide.
Ramey is superb both vocally and dramatically in the role of the villain Assur.  His powerful, agile bass is displayed to perfection in the long and very difficult duets with Semiramide (""Se la vita ancor t' cara"") and Arsace (""Bella imago degli Dei""), and in his own aria, ""Il di gi cade"" toward the end of the opera.  His singing is always elegant, never over the top, even in the basso mad scene (with chorus) when he sees the ghost of the king he and Semiramide had murdered.
The role of Arsace was practically invented by Marilyn Horne.  She has trouble moving around the stage in this Met production and she is quite a bit shorter than the other principals, but that's not what you'll notice when she sings.  Lovely.  The notes just pour out in rich, musical passages with all of the dark coloring that makes her perfect for this role.  I've got a CD of Jennifer Larmore singing Arsace (to Cheryl Studer's Semiramide) and as much as I love her voice, I've got to give my vote to Horne.
Stanford Olsen does a fine job as the thwarted Indian prince, Idreno (he has a much more brilliant and disciplined tenor than the Idreno in Aix-en-Provence).
The Met chorus performs with distinction in the grand manner but rather static staging of this John Copley production.",1035590400,37,2301,4.892030848329049
683000,5,6303522548,"Credibility of plot is not the strong point of this opera. It seems that June Anderson (Semiramide) murdered her husband (the late king) and took the throne herself. It turns out that it's all Samuel Ramey's fault (he's Assur). The high priest knows what happened but never tells anyone until Marilyn Horne (Arsace)comes back home (Arsace is Semiramide's son, only he doesn't know that). The ghost of the murdered king shows up to let everybody know that something is seriously wrong (although he doesn't say what). Semiramide decides to marry Arsace, although he already has a girlfriend (somehow, she doesn't recognize her own son). Arsace, seeking revenge on Assur and swinging his sword around in pitch darkness, mistakenly slices up his mother instead (perhaps explaining how she came to be called SEMI-ramide). Astonishingly, she drops dead on the stage without singing another note. Arsace takes a minute or two to feel bad about this before marrying his girlfriend and taking the throne. Don't let any of this put you off; drama does not depend on plot, especially if it's music drama. The Met's production is absolutely terrific and they couldn't have assembled a better cast. June Anderson, for all her flaws, is the best Semiramide since Sutherland; Marilyn Horne, even so late in her career, sings Arsace's music with incomparable bravura; and Samuel Ramey's combination of technique and swagger make him a perfect Assur. The remaining singers are uniformly excellent and James Conlon leads the cast, orchestra and chorus in the best performance of this opera I've ever seen. Rossini's music is, of course, absolutely wonderful. Don't miss this one.",1028678400,19,1661,5.155555555555556

Joan Sutherland's recording is for the ages. But one cannot SEE it, and it is severely cut.",1456099200,,337,4.435483870967742
7850389,5,6303522548,"This is one of my favorite opera DVDs (and I have hundreds). Anderson, Horne and Ramey are amazing. This is a well done traditional version.

7850390,3,6303522548,"The prospect of having a DVD recording of Semiramide from the Met with all of its glitter and pomp PLUS Marilyn Horne was almost too good to be true. This is a 1990 recording BUT  Marilyn Horne first recorded her role as Arsace in 1965!  The plot hinges on accepting the YOUNG Arsace vowing to avenge his father's death and in conflict about sparing the life of his mother who caused this death . To see a Marilyn Horne looking older than the mother and most other people in the cast is off putting to say the least. Add in the fact that the male role is sung by a contralto adds to the confusion. One regrets that this was not the Horne of the 1965 performance. Having said this and if you can suspend reality there is some gorgeous singing, beautiful costumes and great orchestral support.  I was surprised given the complexity and length of the opera - - it's 220 minutes long - that there was no detailed synopsis or description of characters or cast included with the DVD recording. It certainly would have helped.",1319414400,,1019,4.438502673796791

And there is no alternative. I have no intention of being ultra critical as over-all I thoroughly enjoyed the production.  On the whole, the sound and picture are fine.  The cast is first class, though some act better than others.  It is an opera I will watch many more times.",1314489600,,427,4.565789473684211
7850392,5,6303522548,"In this monumental opera Rossini bade farewell to the Italian operatic stage, leaving behind in this work a template that composers who followed him for the next fifty years would feel constrained to follow even as they were modifying it. Even Verdi in Aida has parts that can only be construed as cabalettas. It would be Arrigo Boito who would eventually free Italian opera from those constraints essentially by freeing the verse forms of the libretti.
In Semiramide Rossini laid out a very clear musical pattern for the numbers that form the opera. The pattern is fast/slow/fast, repeat last fast to allow the singers opportunity to embellish and strut their stuff. The numbers are linked by orchestrally accompanied recitative that explains the plot and sets an emotional temperature that is then expounded upon in the following number.
The performance at hand is a telecast of the much-delayed Metropolitan Opera production mounted for Marilyn Horne. She is excellent as expected, perfectly articulating the incredible coloratura that Rossini created for Arsace, as well as showing how to shape a legato line on seemingly endless breath. She is joined by June Anderson, Samuel Ramey, and Stanford Olsen, who are all no less wonderful. The production is in the glorious ""traditional"" manner, now so widely derided as hopelessly old-fashioned, before we were told that ""great opera is great theater,"" an arrant absurdity. The stories of most operas are based on theatrical conventions of 150 or more years ago, and trying to make them theatrically relevant today is an exercise in futility that serves only to obscure the music that creates the emotional feel of the work and is its essence.
This performance is quite magnificent and is unlikely to be equaled any time soon.
Highest recommendation.",1309910400,7,1800,5.167808219178082
7850393,2,6303522548,"June Anderson is certainly no Joan Sutherland.  While well paced and good recording techniques, performers are less than stellar.  Marilyn Horne is still excellent after some twenty plus years in the role, other performers leave a great deal to be desired (I expected more from the Met and was disappointed).  The 1965/6 Sutherland/Horne recording is still the gold standard only because of the two of then.  The sumptiously voiced D'Archangel on the 1990 Prague recording is still the best Oreo as well as Kundy's Idreno although poor mic placement is a constant distraction.  There is still room for a ""best possible"" cast if one is ever to be created.",1303862400,3,654,4.963302752293578
7850394,2,6303522548,I am beginning to think that opera should be heard and not seen. It is bad enough that trouser roles still exist in the 21st century but to cast a 56 year old stubby fat woman played by Horne as the young male lover is painful to watch. I do not care how beautiful her voice is...and to make matters worse she is the long lost son of her love interest...come on she is old enough to be the mother of her love interest. The MET did the same with Price in Verdi's Forces of Destiny. It is extremely annoying. I see no reason why these young male roles cannot be sung by young attractive tenors. Only in opera is everyone oblivious to the absurd in miscasting it seems. Along this line I refuse to watch a 60 year old Sutherland as a daughter of the regiment.,1303084800,5,756,4.149659863945578
7850395,5,6303522548,"This dramatic Rossini opera is different from many of his other works - not least the almost Wagnerian duration of the performance. It is well cast with all the performers instilling some drama into the work. Marliyn Horne's vocal pyrotechnics as Arsace still astound after many years of stage work, and one can see why she was so renowned in the bel canto repertoire of Rossini and Bellini. June Anderson in the title role is within her territory and copes well with the sometimes fierce vocal demands, although I couldn't help recalling when Sutherland performed the same part with more gusto and brilliance in Melbourne in 1965. As Assur, Samuel Ramey puts a lot into the role and seldom fails to please. He looks the part in this production, without being saddled with the strange headwear he wore in the 1980 Aix en Provence production of this work, also with Marilyn Horne as Arsace. Stanford Olsen sings with a lovely unforced tone and does what he can with the relatively colourless role of Idreno. The performance is kept moving at a lively pace by James Conlon and the rather static Metropolitan Opera chorus do what is required of them. If you like dramatic bel canto singing, lavish sets and costumes it is excellent, with the only disappointment being the lack of any insert or descriptive booklet with the DVD.",1285372800,7,1324,4.786026200873362
