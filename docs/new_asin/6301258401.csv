322835,5,6301258401,Plenty of action in this police thriller about a serial killer in Amsterdam's canals.  All the more realistic for having Dutch actors (speaking English)although the lack of big names explains why the film did not have an international release.,1279065600,5,243,5.230769230769231
322836,3,6301258401,"Amsterdam is in thrall to a serial killer with a somehat unusual modus operandi; he emerges , clad in a scuba suit , from the canals of the city and slays whoever has the misfortune to be passing .

The case is the province of an Inspector -played by Huub Stupel -a laid back character who comes under pressure from his superiors for an early resolution of the case .They appear less concerned with the need to save lives than with the deleterious effect the killings are having on Amsterdam's  vital tourist trade

The bulk of the movie follows standard police procedural lines and is workmanlike if somewhat plodding in execution .The solution relies a little too much on coincidence for my taste --the cop has a girlfriend who visits a  psychiatrist,who just happens to know the killer -and at nearly two hours the movie is overlong .

The climactic chase is good however and the unusual ( in cinema terms ) location helps .

It is an okay time passer and recommended if you want a change from the usual US settings for this type of movie .

I will not make any comments on the acting as the performers are dubbed and dubbing removes at least half the impact of any performance even when done reasonably well -as it is in this instance",1104883200,6,1238,4.475555555555555

7810604,5,6301258401,"Rarely are foreign filmmakers able to beat Hollywood at their own game.  But 1988's Amsterdamned, produced at the tail end of the slasher genre and height of the action film, manages to cram in the best aspects of both.  Directed by Dick Maas (The Lift) with a flair for black humor, memorable characters and one-of-a-kind stunts, his film is so ridiculously entertaining that it's almost criminal there was no way to see properly until now.  Bear in mind, even the most generous plot synopsis makes Maas' film sound like an ill-conceived mess; which makes it's spot-on execution all the more satisfying.

Detective Eric Visser (Hube Stapel) is one of Amsterdam's top cops, but even he is hard up for an explanation in a series of gruesome murders all committed near the city's famous canals.  One witness describes a ""monster"" crawling out of the polluted water.  But it's not long before Visser narrows the possibilities down to a sociopathic scuba diver using the canals to claim his victim then make a stealthy escape.

A visit to the local scuba club introduces Visser to Laura (Monique van de Ven), a novice diver who turns into a sounding board for his investigation...and a love interest after hours.  But their relationship is rudely interrupted as Visser chases down one lead after another, careening through the streets and waterways in pursuit of his suspect, trying to save his career and the city's reputation.

A scuba diving serial killer has to be one of the corniest concepts in a genre full of outrageous ideas.  And Amsterdamned doesn't exactly break new ground as it begins with a clichd POV shot as our killer claims his first victim.  But from the next scene, in which the dead body collides with a tour boat full of Boy Scouts, leaving a bloody trail across the glass ceiling as the kids look on in shock, you just know things are going to get good.  And they do...fast!

The story smoothly shifts gears between inventive stalk and slash kill scenes and a series of intense action sequences as Visser barrels down tight alleyways and - in the film's signature scene - a 10-minute long high speed boat chase through the city's canals.  Choreographed by renowned stunt coordinator Dickey Beer (Raiders of the Lost Ark), every moment looks genuinely dangerous.  And Maas shoots with an eye for impact, taking great advantage of his unique shooting location.

Amsterdamned knows what it's competing against.  There are plenty of references to classic American films, from Jaws to Bullitt to Friday the 13th!  But rather than just reheating leftovers, Maas delivers an invigorating mix of comedy, scares and stunts that knocks the audience on their collective ass.  Now that's how you one-up a Hollywood movie!

Blue Underground's Blu-ray / DVD combo comes with a commentary track from Maas and editor Hans van Dongen, a vintage Making Of, new interviews with Dickey Beer and actor Huub Stapel, trailers, poster & still gallery, collectable booklet and an awesomely '80s music video.  It's a grab bag of good stuff, but the star is the 2K restoration of the film itself, which should make lifelong fans out of every lucky chump who picks up a copy!",1503532800,3,3167,4.8822429906542055

7810606,5,6301258401,"Great 80's slasher movie. I hope this will be released uncut on blu ray someday! If you like movies like The Prowler, New York Ripper, Terror Train etc, you will definitely enjoy this one.",1459209600,4,188,4.5588235294117645
7810607,5,6301258401,"Nice Dutch horror whodunit which some reviewers claim has equal parts ""JAWS"", ""FRIDAY THE 13Th"", and ""JAMES BOND"". Fun thriller to watch on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.",1298851200,3,171,5.142857142857143
