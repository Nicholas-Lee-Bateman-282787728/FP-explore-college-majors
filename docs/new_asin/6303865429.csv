719522,5,6303865429,The quality of Luis Miguel's singing is unsurpassed and this video proves it.  His voice stands alone as one of the best singers of all time in any language.,922752000,7,157,4.413793103448276
719523,5,6303865429,"Somebody please tell me where I can get a copy of ""Ya Nunca Mas"" and ""Fiebre de Amor"" any country any format.",918864000,,109,4.0
719647,5,6303865429,"I've had this dvd for about 10 years now, and I never get tired of watching it.  This concert, in my opinion, is a bit better than his Vivo concert, as LM is in his prime and full of energy.  Wish he'd release more concerts...",1412035200,,226,4.0
719648,5,6303865429,"Love Luis Miguel, this concert its amazing and a collection piece.",1411257600,,66,5.090909090909091
719649,5,6303865429,I have had the CD since the late 90s and the other live DVD and this one just brings back great memories and is good to see him live in young days when he used to jump more... Great DVD,1403308800,,185,3.65
719650,5,6303865429,"I have ordered this DVD before and am about to order two more.  Although its in Spanish and I don't understand the words, the beauty of the music and the talent of Luis Miguel crossed over and made a powerful impact on me.  I first saw the concert on Pay-per-view and had to have it.  I love this DVD and all the music is special.  He really gives his all in this concert.  It is a musical treasure and you don't have to be Spanish to love it.  -- Darna",1391212800,,453,3.977777777777778
719651,5,6303865429,"This amazing artist is my #1 male volcalist, before discovering Luis Miguel my #1 was always the late, great, King of Rock'n'Roll, no need to mention his name eh!.  El Concierto is Luis at his best, I have the Video and the double CD, I also have the video and CD of 'Vivo', in fact although I can't understand a word he says I have 29 CD's and 7 DVD's of this amazing star, his incredible voice is second to none, it's not only his fabulous voice that makes him #1 with me, it's the actual songs he sings and the incredible orchestral arrangments, and he always has the finest musicians I have ever heard. I have many artists singing the old Judy Garland hit 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' believe me, no one can sing it like the amazing LUIS MIGUEL and that arrangement!  I never did have a favorite song till now, if you appreciate excellence, listen to Luis singing 'Mi Humilde Oracion', both songs I've mentioned are on his 'NAVIDADES' Christmas CD. I can whole heartedly recommend absolutely ANYTHING by the amazing LUIS MIGUEL to anyone.",1326758400,,1054,4.542105263157895
719652,5,6303865429,"Luis Miguel's performance is unsurpassed! The way he sang ""Pensar En Ti"" especially towards the end of the song gives me chills. Superb performance!",1294704000,2,148,5.208333333333333
719653,1,6303865429,"Im a big fan of Luis Miguel but this dvd is not nice too see!! every minute they change him in diferents scenarions so is kind ok distractive and boring, besides that he was to young and is not the same voice like he has now.
If you have the chance to buy the concert in 2006 that s the one to have it.
Hope i helps you!",1283731200,,320,3.7205882352941178
719654,5,6303865429,I use to have the VHS recording of this Concert but it eventually fell apart.  This is a great replacement because it is exactly that performance on DVD and the sound and quality are great.  The DVD came well protected and it was definitely brand new.,1267574400,2,251,4.434782608695652
719655,5,6303865429,"Music is good.. a bit old-skool on the video footage, but overall a great music album. Nice arrangements, not crazy about the various camera shots - montages.",1254700800,,158,4.888888888888889
719656,1,6303865429,i cant even track it or get a phone number to call i never received my DVD,1239753600,,74,3.411764705882353
719708,5,6303865429,"No cabe duda si no el mejor, uno de los mejores interpretes  de Mexico y con gran calidad",1207353600,,89,3.9444444444444446
719709,5,6303865429,This is a must have for any true Luis Miguel fan.  It has almost all his best songs and displays his talent.  Is there any other male artist who can belt it out like him?  I think not!!!  Love it - watch it all the time.,1187740800,2,220,3.717391304347826
719710,5,6303865429,I may never get the chance to see him live in concert but this DVD is excellent. The quality of the sound and picture. All the favourite songs played. It is just brilliant.,1178409600,5,172,4.242424242424242
719711,5,6303865429,"OK, I still have the original VHS 1995 release of this and it is absolutely incredible.  This came out right after the time of his Multiplatinum CD release ""Segundo Romance"" and features all the songs on that album as well as some of his tried and true favorites.  I especially enjoy the ""medleys"" of his classics.

My opinion, honestly, one of the best voices ever to be recorded, even live.  This guy is just amazing and I even got my girlfriend to like his music by showing her this tape and letting her listen to some of his best CD's and she doesn't even speak a word of Spanish!  I hope the DVD is remastered for superior sound quality.

Can't wait for the next album!  Luis Miguel you are the man and keep up the fantastic work.",1172102400,13,735,4.321167883211679

719713,5,6303865429,Luis Miguel is definately underated in the USA. His Spanish is flawless (Of course I mean his diction and pronunciation) his passionate singing and choice of musical styles is astounding. How does so much talent wind up in  just one person!,940291200,10,240,4.853658536585366
719714,5,6303865429,"This video of Luis Miguel's concert is just incredible!  His incomparable voice is perfect for all the many types of music he performs - boleros, mariachi, and dance/pop.  It's too bad that so few people here in the U.S.  know about him.  Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin are great, but they pale  in comparison to ""Luis MiRey.""
My only wish is that he would  come and tour the U.S. soon!",935366400,20,389,4.485714285714286
719715,5,6303865429,"No hay palabras para describir el carisma, talento y el estilo unico que describe a LUIS MIGUEL. El sencillamente es el mejor en todo lo que hace. Es un placer verlo en conciertos y una dicha precenciar con que sentimiento  y entrega canta cada cancion. Luis Miguel es sin duda el mejor cantante  latino. Es una verdadera lastima que todavia existan personas que no lo  conocen aqui en los Estados Unidos. El que no conoce de LUIS MIGUEL no sabe  lo que es un artista de calidad. No sabe de lo que se esta perdiendo! Su  talento es unico. Su calidad, estilo y buen gusto hacen una combinacion  perfecta. Definitivamente LUIS MIGUEL ES EL MEJOR!",934502400,9,644,4.556521739130435
