Doris Day and Brian Keith performed well together and had a screen warmth that worked.  This was Doris's last movie, her husband Martin Melcher died soon afterwards and she found herself millions of dollars in debt and she then turned to television where her TV show ran for 5 years.

1195549,4,B000006GTO,"It's been ages since I've seen a Doris Day movie, and this was a pretty hectic and hilarious flick. If you don't know the story, it's about two once-married people (Day and Brian Keith) who form a mutual attraction and get hitched, though that's when the problems begin: their two eldest hate one another, and of course nothing goes right. Long story short, there are arguments and misunderstandings and a street fight and a car chase and hippies and a car accident and a police station. And can you guess what you get when the dust settles? Here's a spoiler you saw coming a mile away) a nice, happy family.

What I found of interest - besides the RIDICULOUS story line, and the RIDICULOUSLY broad stereotypes of the 1960s in which this was set - were the secondary characters: Barbara Hershey is Keith's eldest daughter, Jamie Farr and William Christopher (Klinger and Father Mulcahey from TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H/dp/B000HT3P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H</a>) were two hippies; LEAVE IT TO BEAVER's Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond) played a guy named Duke; George freakin' Carlin is a soda hop (if you remember that term). And the GRASSROOTS were playing at a terminally hip nightspot!

If one were to base a film verily upon its merits - especially as it stands today - I can't see this being much else than a 3, at best. At BEST. But this is a classic Doris Day movie, and one of her best when it was released. There's an ineffable quality of innocent, wholesome sexuality she brought to these kinds of projects, and for a person of my age, it still travels sufficiently well. It's by all means a classic, though quite obviously dated.

And so, yes, the plot is, well, RIDICULOUS, but you just  can't watch this classic without having a good time. Believe me, I tried.",1372809600,,1838,4.977198697068404

Badly injured in car accident at 14, she recov-

radio staion. From 1966 back through 1944 she
put out one hit record after another. Her acting
career began in Los Angeles, Ca., when she won
the auditon for the part of a nightclub singer in

""It's Magic"".

1195596,4,B000006GTO,"WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is a 1968 romantic family comedy, and it marked Doris Day's bowing out of theatrical pictures. But the real life behind-the-scenes story couldn't have been more different from the tone of the movie. Shortly after the film's shooting had ended, Doris Day's husband and manager, Marty Melcher, died from heart disease. It was then that Doris learned that Melcher and his business partner had embezzled and frittered away her fortune into shaky investments. Moreover, unknown to her, Melcher had committed her to carry her own upcoming television series on CBS. Doris Day felt obligated to honor that contract, in part to make good on the debts Melcher had amassed. She did the DORIS DAY SHOW from 1968 to 1973 and also two television specials, after which she promptly called it quits from show business. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is a bit funnier than all that.

This film isn't Doris Day's best, I don't think anyone'll call me out on that. It may've even suffered from comparisons to Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda's similarly themed (and better) YOURS, MINE AND OURS, which came out earlier that same year. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL rides on its good cast, on its smarts, on that affable chemistry between the two leads. Abby McClure (Day) is a middle-aged (but still cute) widow raising three boys. She runs a lumber yard adeptly and professes not to need a man in her life, even though her sister persists in setting her up. Chemical engineer Jake Iverson (Brian Keith, having brought his full-on gruff) is a widower bringing up his teenaged daughter Stacey (a young Barbara Hershey making her film debut). Abby and Jake are set up by Abby's sister, except that they get off on a rocky start. In cinema, a couple getting off on a rocky start is a spot-on indicator that they'll be locking lips by the time the film fades out.

It's a smart movie, as I've mentioned. The genuine humor surfaces from Day and Keith's interactions. These two stars seem to be channeling their inner Hepburn & Tracy to very good effect. Doris Day is as warm as ever, as peppy. Brian Keith just has that solid, laconic presence. Both personalities play off each other wonderfully. Another asset is that the hurdles Abby and Jake overcome are all realistic ones, expected ones. And they don't face obstacles only as a married couple. The first half of the film has these two single parents sneaking around at the local drive-in for an order of coffee and necking. It's noteworthy that a few of these courtship scenes come off as relatively racy, racy relative to its era, anyway. But when they elope - an act not at all sanctioned by the children - and begin merging their two households, then come the real challenges. The happily eloped couple find their problems exacerbated, having to cope with Abby's oldest son's anger at being deposed as the man of the house, Jake's sullen daughter being so possessive of her father, and just where the heck do they all live. (Answer to this last one: they alternate houses, of course.) The dogs from the respective families don't even like each other.

It takes a long while for these two households to come to terms. When Abby and Stacey finally bond, we're treated to a scene that is both satisfying and a clever bit of psychology. However, the big final act absolutely veers away from the realism and sense of grounding that had marked the film up to this point. Apparently, even though Abby and Stacey had made their peace, it wouldn't take anything less than repeated poultry truck collisions, a wave of motorcycled hippies, and everyone getting arrested before the rest of the fam sees the light. By the way, a pre-M*A*S*H Jamie Farr has a supporting role as one of the hippies. By the way, having hippies in it tends to date a film. Stand-up comic George Carlin also has a bit part as a drive-in waiter who keeps hitting on Doris Day. He's practically unrecognizable here.

When all's said and done, this is a Doris Day movie and I'm rather fond of her. So, deserving or not - and even though she doesn't sing in this one and even though there are those awkward moments in which a 1950s sweetheart tries to fit into the mod/counterculture/whatever-it-is scene - I'm still allotting 4 stars out of 5 for her feature film swan song. And also because I got a kick out of the poultry truck driver's outraged accusation: ""This has got to be a plot against the chickens of America!"" Heh.",1296432000,,4431,4.669654289372599

1195604,5,B000006GTO,"Still youthful-looking at 46, Doris Day plays Abby McClure, a widow who's running her late husband's lumberyard, trying to raise three boys (Flip (John Findlater), 18; Mitchell (Jimmy Bracken), 10; and Jason (Richard Steel), 7) and an Olde English Sheepdog, and fending off her older sister Maxine (Pat Carroll), who's determined to see her matched up with a new mate.  When Max's choice for her dinner date cancels out, she's maneuvered into inviting Jake Iverson (Brian Keith), an old friend of herself and her husband, in his place.  Abby and Jake haven't seen each other in six or seven years--since before Phil McClure's death--and Jake, a chemical engineer for a petroleum company, is ""in the same boat [Abby is],"" single-parenting a 17-year-old daughter, Stacey (Barbara Hershey), and a poodle.  Much to their mutual astonishment, they find themselves attracted to each other from the start.  After a brief break caused when Abby mistakes Stacey for Jake's ""young chick"" girlfriend, they contrive a strange courtship (mostly at the local drive-in eatery because neither Flip nor Stacey approves of the possibility of a stepparent) and finally elope to Vegas.  Now begins an exhausting round of Musical Houses (neither one has enough room for a family of six) that culminates in a terrible fight and a delightfully wild chase as Jake, having accidentally tumbled out the back of the camper they borrowed from Max and her husband as an extra emergency bedroom, tries to make his way home and Abby, accompanied by a gang of motorcycle-mounted hippies (led by Jamie Farr and William Christopher, who later teamed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H-Martinis-and-Medicine-Complete-Collection/dp/B000HT3P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection</a>) and a pair of cops, tries to catch up with him.  In the end a clash with the driver (Vic Tayback of ""Alice"") of a chicken truck unexpectedly brings the family together, a new and bigger house is bought, and the future looks rosy for all.

Though at first blush the movie may seem to be a poor man's version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yours-Mine-and-Ours/dp/B000056MMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yours, Mine and Ours</a>, there really isn't much similarity between the two: instead of all the kids resisting the union, the obstructionism comes mainly from the two oldest ones (Mitch and Jason seem to accept Jake without much friction, perhaps because they can barely remember their real father).  But, like Fonda and Ball, Day and Keith have a good, gentle, believable chemistry, and Carroll (with Herb Voland as her long-suffering lawyer husband, Harry Scott) and Alice Ghostley as Abby's housekeeper Molly add a fillip of extra humor.  The '60's ambience--ultra-straight Flip, the performance cameo by the group The Grass Roots, and above all the hippies--is another plus that may get families talking about that now long-past era.  As you might expect from a Doris Day movie, there's absolutely nothing here that any parent could object to, and families both blended and otherwise should find it fun.",1256515200,2,3196,5.6120331950207465
1195605,5,B000006GTO,"Doris Day's final movie is my favorite Doris Day movie for many reasons. First, the year was 1968 and although the generation gap was booming in America, this movie shows the best of how we got along in this country. I was a kid when my parents took me to see this movie in the theatre when it was first released and I've always loved it. Americans were facing the Vietnam War, the assasinations of RFK and Martin Luther King, Jr., the hippies and drug revolution was ruining too much of American youth but many families were holding things together and that is something which has been overlooked by history. In this movie, we see Doris holding down the responsibilities of owning a family business and taking care of her three kids as a single mom (and she looks absolutely beautiful throughout the entire movie) and Brian Keith as a hard working, level headed, single dad raising a teenage daughter during these turbulent times. Doris and Brian meet and well, you'll have to trust me that there is sheer magic on the screen between them. It's also fun to see the 1968 cars and the styles of houses (which were much nicer than the cheap looking, aluminum sided townhouses and condos so widespread today in the US).
Brian Keith had a hit TV show with ""Family Affair"" on CBS during the making of this movie and Doris Day was about to launch her own ""The Doris Day Show"" later in 1968 on CBS. Two superstars of film and TV in one movie. It's a real treat to watch over and again.",1250294400,3,1478,4.4575645756457565

1195611,4,B000006GTO,"Doris Day was easily the most bankable movie star of the late 1950s and early 1960s, winning critical favor and wide popularity with such films as PILLOW TALK, PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES, and many others.  But as time passed, Day's husband and manager Martin Melcher selected material that began to errode her career: films such as THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT and DO NOT DISTURB were popular but weakly scripted, and even Day's star power couldn't save such disasters as CAPRICE, THE BALLAD OF JOSIE, and WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  In 1968, however, Day re-established her reputation with her final feature film: WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL.

Abby (Day) is a widow with three sons; Jake (Brian Keith) is a widower with a daughter.  When Abby's matchmaking sister forces the two together the result is not immediately positive--but it doesn't take long before romantic sparks begin to fly.  Unfortunately, their children are considerably less enthusiastic about the match and no sooner are the two serious than war errupts with significant nastiness.

At the peak of her career Day tended to specialize in absurd comedies that could never happen in real life, so it is a little surprising to discover that EGGROLL is actually quite realistic up to a point.  The newlyweds begin by trying to placate the children and their efforts gradually raise to ridiculous but entirely plausible heights--at least until the last ten minutes or so, when the film swings less successfully into broad farce.  Even so, the script is amusing, the cast (particularly Alice Ghostly) is memorable, and when Day and Kieth square off in a wittily scripted argument you are suddenly aware that both were exceptional at their craft.

Following EGGROLL Day would appear in television's THE DORIS DAY SHOW and make several other television appearances--largely in order to pay off the debts left to her by Melcher, who died just as EGGROLL was released.  But unlike many other stars who announce retirement only to make a series of endless comebacks, Day made a graceful exit.  When she quit, she quit. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is hardly among her best films, it is a fond farewell nonetheless, charming without being cloying, witty without being waspish.  The DVD offers no bonuses of any kind, but the film itself is in excellent condition.  Recommended.

1195612,2,B000006GTO,"I grew up in the 50's and 60's.  I grew up loving Doris Day movies.  But, I must say, this is not one of the good ones.
  I do not have any idea why people repeatedly say this is a ""family movie"".  It most certainly is not, and I actually wonder if the people that are saying this have actually seen it lately.  The basic theme of the movie is that widowed Doris Day desperately must be in need of sex.  In comes a somewhat creepy and stalking Brian Keith.  What results is more boring and odd than anything else.  The movie is not funny, in any sort of traditional way.  It is really wierd--- I tried watching it with my teen-age daughters and they thought it the most bizarre movie they had ever seen.
  The only reason it gets any stars at all is because of the aforementioned 60's weirdness which is entertaining in a kitschy kind of way.
  If you want great family movies from the 60's, how about ""That Darn Cat"". ""The Trouble with Angels"", or ""The Reluctant Astronaut"".  Or for older kids and all adults, ""The World of Henry Orient"".

Her sister (Pat Carroll) pushes her into a date with fellow widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith), who has a teenage daughter (Barbara Hershey).

Bonding over their collective experiences, Abby and Jake fall in love and get married secretly in Vegas, to the horror of their children!  This family comedy zips along nicely, much of the credit goes to Day who turns some fairly ho-hum dialogue and scenes into gold.  Brian Keith is ably-partnered and the young Barbara Hershey reveals the acting talent she would successfully hone in later years.

1195659,4,B000006GTO,"""With Six You get Eggroll"" bowed in the nation's theatres in August of 1968.  It quickly became a popular success at the box-office thanks, in large part, to the enduring popularity of the film's star, Doris Day.  Although some critics compared it, unfairly, to another comedy success, ""Yours Mine, and Ours"", ""Eggroll"" can more than stand on it's own merits.
The story about a widow with three children who falls in love with a widower with one daughter, is not new or original. However, thanks to a charming script, smooth direction by Howard Morris and the cast headed by Day and Brian Keith, who have a great onscreen chemistry, it's a delight. By the film's conclusion, audiences have shed a few tears and had more than a few laughs.
Doris Day plays the 40ish widow with charm, sex appeal, and a great deal of warmth.  She is completely convincing and it's in her small touches that she especially proves her mettle as one of the most natural screen actresses ever.  Keith is manly and real, and the supporting cast which includes Pat Carroll, Alice Ghostley, George Carlin, Barbara Hershey, Jamie Farr, and the popular rock group, The Grass Roots, lend credible support.
While the film, the first production of the CBS film wing, may betray it's television roots, seeming at times like a pilot for a sitcom, it is ultimately a fine working of a winning formula.
This was Day's cinema swan song, after two decades of enormous popularity, and it's a film that none of the participants need feel anything but pride in.",971654400,130,1521,4.75

Even though this (to date) is Doris' last  film....you'll find yourself shopping for more of her films....if you don't  already have a hefty collection! Other cast members: Brian Keith, Alice  Ghostly, Barbara Hershey, and George Carlin...just to name a few, make this  ensemble cast seem like ""the real thing"". The story takes place  in the 60's, but still plays well in the 21st century! Anyone who has  either been married/divorced/a parent (or knows someone that fits that  description) will enjoy & probably laugh-out-loud at the antics  portrayed in this film. Doris (as usual) gives a wonderful comedic  performance, and her love interest-Brian Keith is very sexy & adorable!  Don't just rent this one, BUY IT!",962928000,13,949,5.302013422818792
1195661,5,B000006GTO,"An early Brady Bunch proto-type?  It stars Doris Day and Brian Keith who marry and merge families.  It is hilarious and shows off Doris Day's comedic talent and timing.  So sad this was her last movie, but she went  out with a bang.  Brian Keith was perfectly cast as her husband.",960076800,7,280,4.411764705882353
1195662,4,B000006GTO,"I had no idea when I went to see ""With Six You Get Eggroll"" in New York that it would be the last film in which Doris Day would appear. From reading the reviews, I was poised to believe that the picture was  ""kin"" to another film called ""Yours, Mine and Ours""  starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, which was a bawdy, predictable and  loud film with too many children.
Much to my surprise and pleasure,  ""Eggroll"" had very little similarity and was quite enjoyable and  a satisfying experience.
Doris Day was at the end of her film career.  Sex, almost hardcore, had landed on America's screens with films like  ""Carmen, Baby"" and ""Fuego"", not to mention, Mike  Nichols's ""The Graduate"" which Marty Melcher, Day's  husband/manager, turned down for Miss Day because he felt it was  ""vulgar"".  Unfortunately, she was not making her own decisions,  because ""The Graduate"" could have saved her film career and  carried her through the '70s.  But, I don't regret Melcher's vision.  Doris  Day's image on the screen will always remain youthful and beautiful, like  Marilyn Monroe's, for all time.
""With Six You Get Eggroll"" was  a familiar story with which audiences could relate. Two unmarried people,  Abby McClure (Day) and Jake Iversen (Brian Keith) both with children, meet,  fall in love and decide to get married.  Of course, their offspring are  hurt and resentful and inevitably, chaos arises.
Brian Keith, movie actor  and star of television's ""Family Affair"", was chosen as Day's new  co-star and he was a wonderful and realistic choice considering the subject  matter.  He was not ""Rock, Garner or Cary Grant handsome"", but a  rugged, very believable guy that would attract a movie star-type, like  Doris Day.  They had strange ""chemistry"" and I liked the fact  that he gave the impression that 'she can't be real AND free!'  Obviously,  Abby McClure didn't like living without a man around the house.
The  picture marked the screen debut of Barbara Hershey who plays Keith's rather  possessive daughter, Stacey, who is a school-mate of Doris' son, Flip,  played with snotty indignation by John Findlater. Day has two other sons,  Mitch and Jason (Jimmy Bracken and Richard Steele) who are typically unruly  for their young ages.
Alice Ghostley portrays Doris' maid, like Paul  Lynde in drag.  She is very funny as is Pat Carroll as Miss Day's  matchmaking sister, Maxine. The picture really isn't about anything, simply  a series of ""happenings"" that spark arguments, jealousy,  slapstick and romance.  Doris Day is absoulutely charming in her role and  her years of screen acting yielded a first-rate performance. She is a  natural.  When Abby, fed up with the belligerence of Hershey, orders her to  do all of the housework, is confronted by Jake, when he discovers that  Abby's son played basketball instead of helping with the chores, blows up.  Keith and Day have a knock-down-drag-out fight, leaving Abby physically  shaking with anger.  They are wonderful in this scene.
I also enjoyed  Day's natural air when she was finally alone in her house, getting a snack  and walking to her lonely bed. Beautiful and totally unaffected.
There is  slapstick, expertly handled by Miss Day, of course, and an array of  familiar faces along the way. Vic Tayback (""Alice"") as a truck  driver, Jackie Joseph (""Doris Day Show""), Allen Melvin (""All  in the Family""), George Carlin as ""Herbie"" and Peter Leeds,  a veteran of many Day films added bright moments to the proceedings.
Even  Doris Day had no idea that this would be her final film. In real-life,  Marty Melcher died, she discovered he had squandered her vast fortune and,  without her knowledge, signed Miss Day to star in a television series at  CBS.  So went her film career.",959817600,11,3736,4.935379644588045
