8505093,2,B006VTPYQO,"I checked this out of the library to watch with my teenagers because I thought it was going to be a history of the FICTIONAL, IMAGINATIVE concept of zombies -- and the first part was, mostly.

But about halfway through, this documentary (Q:  can a show about something which does not exist actually be called a ""documentary""?) became solidly premised on the idea that a real-life ""zombie apocalypse"" is ""inevitable.""  In other words, zombies either really exist now, or will soon, and they genuinely and actually will pose a humongous and real threat to human life.  OMG.  (And this was produced by the History Channel? As in, a channel dedicated to real, actual History?)

It is completely irresponsible to fill the heads of young and/or feeble-minded people with the fearful idea that humanity is headed to a ""showdown"" with something as bogusly science-fiction as ""zombies.""  To start advising people that they had better keep weapons in the house specifically designed to kill zombies, and to show viewers how to use weapons to smash zombies in the head, punch out their eyes, etc., is -- again-- completely irresponsible.",1436140800,,1126,4.989304812834225
