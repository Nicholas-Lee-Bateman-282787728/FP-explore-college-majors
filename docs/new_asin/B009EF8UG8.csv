8540583,1,B009EF8UG8,"This might be the worst cycling movie ever.  The rider is a tool, meathead, doesn't even ride straight through, eats fast food and potato chips? What a joke, don't waste your money I couldn't even make it all the way through this joke of a cyclin flick.",1393545600,,253,4.382978723404255
8540584,5,B009EF8UG8,"This is an inspiring documentary.  We were truly impressed by Max's commitment to this mission and are still talking about his accomplishment, which is truly extraordinary.  How someone achieves the goal of riding 50 states in 50 days really goes far beyond the ability to document, but this film does a great job.  There is no denying Max's suffering - the video can't lie about his obvious pain, illness, frustration and weight loss.  Part of his difficulty is the short (3 months) prep time and his recent knee surgery.  The low donation $$ toward the 9/11 Help America Foundation during the ride was no doubt due to the lack of time for extensive promotion but it obviously weighed heavily upon him - it would have defeated any normal human being.  There was probably a ton of film footage and I was really impressed with the film quality and editing.  The cons (for us) were: a dramatic, but short, narrative and f-bombs.  These shouldn't detract from Max's staggering accomplishment, however, which was epic!!",1371945600,,1015,4.8604651162790695
8540585,5,B009EF8UG8,"This is a truly remarkable story of inner strength, dedication, self sacrifice and absolutely inspiring!  you will laugh, you will tear up and you will admire this amazing tribute to the victims of 9/11.  Watching Max go from strong, determined and unwavering,  to thin, exhausted and finally after battling the elements, uncertain, it will make you proud to be an American!",1351555200,,374,5.098360655737705
