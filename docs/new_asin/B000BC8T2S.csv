8084924,3,B000BC8T2S,"The first movie was the best. Topless and full frontals. Some up close views. 3-4 stars. The second movie was a complete waste of film, utter garbage. Negative 5 stars. Third movie was kind of ok. It was a silent film, but there was a narrator at times. Three women are topless multiple times and an extended period of time. Two or three other women are topless for a very brief period of time. All women are topless only. 2-3 stars",1523059200,,432,4.345679012345679
8084925,4,B000BC8T2S,"I'm giving this four stars for the presentation and package. Something Weird and Image together did some wonderfully trashy and bizarre discs of exploitation and sexploitation films, and all of those discs are packed full of weird, occasionally wonderful, and decidedly cheap films -- well, comebody had to preserve our cinematic heritage!

With this one you get three sleazy slabs of celluloid, a wheezy thing of stills and trading cards and bizarre music and sound bites, and an unusually small number of trailers -- usually SW threw in six to eight trailers, and sometimes a couple of sleazy short films as well. Just think: you can get that sleazy all-night cinema experience without the stinky cinema, wheezing patrons with hats pulled down over their faces, sticky floor, or bedbugs.",1489017600,2,789,5.116279069767442

8084928,1,B000BC8T2S,"it was all in black-white, not color as listed...a terrible film, bad acting, bad editing, there was nothing good I could say about these three movies.",1372377600,,151,4.846153846153846
8084929,2,B000BC8T2S,"The movie was pretty good to watch. if you would like to see what happens to the women, who are raped and have to go through gang bangs to live. all three titles show women having sex, later are raped.",1344297600,6,201,4.05
8084930,4,B000BC8T2S,"IN HOT BLOOD(58min/1968)- A shapely Latina is drawn into a strange world of whips & chains all done under the guise of ""fashion modeling"". A narrator with a slightly fruity east-coast twang describes the action as the group of underground sex fiends begin their orgy of lust. There's a buxom chick in dark glasses acting as the dominatrix. Then the shapely Latina becomes the center-piece of the sex fiends as they treat her like a piece of meat.

THE LUSTING HOUR(69min/1967)- Starts out with an on-screen definition of the word ""lust"". Then a gyrating female pelvis fills the screen as we see an intermittent photo of Paul McCartney(?!). Part 1 starts out with ""House Girls"" as a pompous narrator begins an expose of a brothel then goes on to berate ""pornographers"". Part 2 ""Street Girls"" starts with a couple of NY chicks babbling about the street-walk business while taking a bubble bath. Then we see a weirdo ""Male Hustler"" hanging out at a men's room trying to stare at urinating men. Part 3 ""Call Girls"" continues with the pompous narrator talking about the expense of renting a posh apartment and the price of clothing/beauty products for the Call Girls. We see some nostalgic scenes of NYC along the way with giant billboards of hard liquor and various porn shops.

THE ULTIMATE DEGENERATE(71min/1969)- We start with a buxom blonde getting her ""kicks"" from stripping in front of the window. Then her preachy girlfriend goes into a lesbo makeout session with the blonde. Looking for adventure, our shapely blonde answers a sex ad then travels to a kooky house with a creepo in a wheelchair. There are strange sex shows and subsequent scenes of various perversions. Some women are punished with pliers(guess where the pliers are used?). There's a twist ending involving the odd helper guy(kinda lame).

Most of the chicks in all three flicks are 60's shapely and well built(no toothpicks here). There are a small amount of extra features. First there are the trailers for the main features[The Ultimate Degenerate(7:50), The Lusting Hours(3:55), In Hot Blood(2:32)]. Each trailer is pretty long. Then there is Gallery of 60's Sex Stills with Audio Oddities(11:47). Nice collection for fans of late 60's psycho sex grindhouse flicks courtesy of Something Weird Video.",1288828800,18,2273,5.007936507936508
8084931,1,B000BC8T2S,"Whew! The people at SWV must have been mad at some one the day they put these 3 gems together. I have viewed stinkers before but these three make the top of the chart. First of all they were listed as being in color which I prefer. However, the only thing in color was the jacket they came in. The Ultimate Degenerate was the best of the three. Lots of nudity with plenty of bush but OH! MY! over weight actresses with droopy boobs and not good looking to boot. The plot - a girl desperate to get out of town joins a sleaze fest of bimbos and two strange male characters one in a wheel chair. That's it! Every sex scene was cut abruptly short. The voice over was so bad I thought the movie was dubbed.
  The Lusting Hour was topless only and had two good looking chicks with nice bodies but the director focused on a native american gal who was anything but. I pushed fast forward hoping to find somethinmg of interest. I never pushed the play button until it was over.
  In Hot Blood was supposed to be a documentary of some sort but I couldn't get through it.
  There was hope of rescue. Usually the SWV package has good trailers and extras which can make the purchase worth while even if the movies are bad. Not this one. The only extras are trailers for the movies.
  So...if you have 10 bucks to waste give it to the Salvation Army. Stay clear of this package. Mine's going into the trash which is where the originals should have stayed.",1252886400,15,1442,4.256410256410256
