7985661,5,B00008LE0T,"This Australian film on the early career of Percy Grainger is nothing short of amazing.  Richard Roxburgh and Barbara Hershey are Percy and his mother, Rose Grainger.  Emily Woof, as one of Grainger's protegees also turns in a compelling performance.  The film explores some of the dark sides of Grainger, including his proclivity for bondage, so is not for the kiddies.  The exquisite soundtrack includes Grainger as well as Grieg, Mozart and others.  For the musicologist or Grainger-ite, this is a ""must-see.""  This is a Canadian DVD, region 1 -- NTSC, so look for it -- it is around and it is well worth pursuing.",1289692800,,617,4.828571428571428
