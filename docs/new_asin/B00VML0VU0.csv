8710598,5,B00VML0VU0,I loved it! It was beautiful seeing how these warrior women and their partners embodied those 40 weeks from beginning to end. I loved how the writer showed the mystery and the beauty of life no matter how a woman labors. You can never anticipate a perfect birth plan but you can always count on having precious baby that makes all of it worth it.,1484265600,,346,4.338461538461538

8710602,3,B00VML0VU0,"This is a fun documentary and it does a great job of showing a wide range of pregnancy experiences and births. This was just my preference, but I really did not like the male voice that narrated the movie ( I found it a bit creepy) as well as the two female medical professionals featured. I am a birth worker myself and found them to be kind of condescending and off-putting. So 3 stars but enjoyable if you are a pregnant mama.",1433462400,,429,4.2439024390243905

8710604,5,B00VML0VU0,"I am a mom and I loved this movie. I wish I had seen it when I was pregnant and so anxious and looking for comfort. Finally!! This is a feel-good movie that doesnt sugarcoat or judge. Its a funny and touching film that follows a group of real women through their pregnancies. The women in 40 Weeks come to us as they are, and remind me of myself when I was pregnant. This is not ""reality pregnancy"", they are being authentic and vulnerable and it's a beautiful thing. I journeyed along with them, celebrating their ups and feeling sad when they experience downs. Watching the film felt a bit like hanging out with my girlfriends (and is best watched with a group of friends - and a box of tissues nearby). The message is encouraging and supportive without being preachy or prescriptive like other pregnancy documentaries I watched when I was looking for comfort. I walked away feeling good about pregnancy and about my body. I highly recommend it to anyone who is pregnant or whose partner or family member or friend is pregnant.",1430265600,3,1029,4.5675675675675675
