8673846,4,B00MPUGA4S,"I have the Screen Archives Entertainment version [not from Spain] of this movie. I love this movie. In this version, we have lossless DTS HD Master Audio 2.0, plus other audio tracks: isolated music and effects, plus 2 commentary tracks. The audio, although not surround, has never sounded as good, including comparing to the original soundtrack CD. With all those musical greats playing [credited at the end in the sound credits], you can't go wrong, if only on the basis of the music. ""Moonglow"" by the Benny Goodman Quartet has been freshly redone, well beyond what it was in the original soundtrack CD, to eliminate surface noise and such from old versions, as is now possible with today's audio tech.

The only minus is that the video lacks an expensive, top notch video remaster, so 4.5 stars and not 5. High Definition, etc., yes, but the colors are a bit off, with Michelle's famous, bright red dress coming in at a somewhat dull reddish color. The movie is of a downscale piece of life, often in dull industrial areas, so the presentation often matches the intended mood of the movie. However, a top notch video remaster [Criterion, anyone?] would have been nice. I agree with Roger Ebert's 1989 opinion in his review that Michelle singing ""Makin' Woopee"" in that red dress on top of a grand piano, alone, is [still] worth the price of admission.",1437177600,3,1355,4.76595744680851
8673847,5,B00MPUGA4S,"A great movie, AND FINALLY -  IN BLU-RAY (even though it was imported from Spain at a slightly higher cost than most U.S. products).  It is a full screen (16x9) movie with 2.0 Dolby Digital sound and it still has great ""Audio & Video"".  Highly recommend for other collectors who have waited many years for this classic to come out in Blu-ray format. MICHELLE PFEIIFFER AT HER BEST.",1432684800,3,381,4.573529411764706
