But, from the ones I have seen, any stretches that she demonstrates are only held for 5 or 6 seconds. Most fitness experts recommend holding a stretch for 20 - 30 seconds. Additionally, it's very awkwardly produced, Ms. Pak stares into the camera with a forced smile on her face. I do like the combat boots and skirt combo she wears in one of the routines. I'm very disappointed in this, but at least it was inexpensive.",1430784000,,545,4.300970873786408
8124319,5,B000FKPEEC,This DVD is awesome! Just what I was looking for in an office workout. It consists mainly of stretching exercises to do at work cubicle/station that are 5 minutes in length. You do one in the morning and one in the afternoon and you can even do one on your coffee break. Before you know it you've upped your exercise workout by 15 minutes and the stretches feel soooo good after working at your computer all day. This is truly the diamond that I was looking for to help me get in a few minutes more of exercise throughout the day. So glad to have found it!!!!!,1359331200,3,560,4.242990654205608
