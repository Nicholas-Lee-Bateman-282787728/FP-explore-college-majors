8522013,5,B007USPM8U,"As a citizen, this documentary made me realize the importance of the media and how media consolidation affects our liberty to be able to hear diverse points of view on the radio. I really appreciated getting a full spectrum of ideas and perspectives. I was not aware of the gobbling up of all of the radio stations by these big corporations like Clear Channel but now I realize how the progressive and liberal voices have been systematically silenced! This should be required viewing for every journalism major at every university in the country!",1335916800,,546,4.881720430107527
8522014,5,B007USPM8U,"Media consolidation is an important issue for our country and democracy.  From the local case of KLSD to Robert Reich and Bill Moyers, this excellent documentary tells the story that all Americans should know.  See this move and spread the word.",1335916800,,245,4.951219512195122
8522015,5,B007USPM8U,"This is an excellent documentary for those who wonder why they can hear the likes of Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk radio shows on the radio just about anywhere one drives in the US while it's a struggle to hear progressive talk radio even in large cities in the US with active progressive populations.  Through the backdrop of the rise and fall of progressive talk station 1360 in San Diego, Save KLSD reveals the various forces at work that have sadly drowned out diversity, competition and localism in radio, providing yet another example of how the mechanisms of power in the US continue to be funneled down to a very small percentage of people.

The issues raised in the film in the context of media consolidation definitely parallel comparable issues being raised via the Occupy Movement that will surely be at issue in the 2012 election.  KLSD listeners will recognize many locals in the film including Congressman Bob Filner, Councilwoman Marti Emerald and Andrew Donohue of Voice of San Diego.",1335225600,,1013,4.912280701754386
8522016,5,B007USPM8U,"The film chronicles the rise and fall of a small left-leaning talk radio station (KLSD) in a conservative-dominated market. As the region's only left-wing voice, the station builds an extremely loyal, active following only to be abruptly replaced with sports radio programming in a market seemingly saturated with this type of programming. KLSD's journey is juxtaposed with insightful commentary from Robert Reich, Phil Donohue, Van Jones and many, many others.

Before I saw ""Save KLSD"" I knew only bits and pieces about media consolidation and why the vast majority of talk radio is conservative. Now I have a much better understanding of the forces behind this change and the wide-reaching negative effects on our nation as well as our communities. I was stunned to learn what can happen in an emergency or natural disaster when a radio station no longer has a local presence.

Whether you are a former KLSD listener or someone who wants to better understand the dramatic shift away from locally-based radio, SEE THIS FILM. It is definitely an eye opener!",1334793600,,1058,5.074712643678161
8522017,5,B007USPM8U,"I've been concerned with the concentration of ownership of media seriously eroding the flow of information and discussion of issues vital to a free society.  Radio in many areas, including major market San Diego,  is  dominated by sports, canned music, and conservative talk - liberal voices silenced. This film examines the extent of this trend with insightful commentary including Phil Donahue, government officials, and academics. If you share these concerns, you must see this important documentary.",1334707200,,503,5.592105263157895
8522018,4,B007USPM8U,"Gives some great history and explanation of what has gone awry with talk radio in the US and why about 90% of talk radio is slanted right.  Focusing on San Diego as ground zero and how that community lost their only progressive talk radio station, a small 5,000 watt AM operation and one of 9 owned by Clear Channel in that market at the time that formerly played oldies and standards and garnered very low ratings. Despite its relatively weak signal compared to its rightwing 50,000 watt giant sister station and 4 other rightwing talkers, KLSD developed a hardcore following from 2004-2007, where progressive talent like Ed Schultz and Randi Rhodes beat their conservative competition. And according to the KLSD program director, KLSD had the highest ""time spent listening"" ratings of any of their stations.

The 3 large corporate radio owners began eliminating progressive radio stations throughout the US in 59 markets and San Diego's was one of the last to go.  Even the station's program director publicy stated that he never saw such an outpouring of support and love for a station in his many years of work in broadcasting. The corporate explanation given about terminating the station said it was due to a loss of revenue. Others say that wasn't the case.  After KLSD went off the air, their ratings fell off a cliff, and most likely, so did their revenue.  See this and you decide. This is their story....this is our story.",1334707200,,1433,4.83265306122449
