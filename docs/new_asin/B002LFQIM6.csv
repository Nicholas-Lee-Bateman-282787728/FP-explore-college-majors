3947611,5,B002LFQIM6,"Such fun.  An opposite of Christmas Carol, in which he realizes he should have been more selfish, instead of less.  Nice to have Jim Broadbent in here, and Robbie Coltrane, too.  Love the daffy shrilly-giggling niece and ""piggy-wiggy-wiggy-wiggy-woo"" lyrics.",1388016000,3,258,5.564102564102564

3947613,3,B002LFQIM6,"I purchased this disc because I did not have ""Blackadder Back and Forth"".  It also includes the ""Cavalier Years"" and ""Blackadder's Christmas Carol"". The images are somewhat cleaned up from the previous DVD release but not enough to repurchase it if you already own the 2001 issues. My biggest problem is with ""Christmas Carol"".  It's edited!  The line where Baldrick talks about using the Christmas Jesus dog for the Easter play is missing! It was uncut on the previous release. I have to imagine that it's also missing from the new remastered box set. Fortunately I already have it on the Blackadder III disc or I would be very upset.  It may be my imagination but it also looks like the widescreen picture on 'Back and Forth' has been slightly stretched from 1.66 to 1.78.  So, 5 stars for the for the shows themselves but docked to 3 stars for  the questionable editing choices.",1263254400,35,881,4.688311688311688

3947633,4,B002LFQIM6,"Anyone who is a fan of Rowan Atkinson, especially as the much-reincarnated Black Adder, should buy this for one reason alone- the version of Christmas Carol which was never included in the season collections. It is the best send-up of this classic I've ever seen, featuring Black Adder and Baldrick in their Victorian era best. The story allows them to time travel, of course, so everyone gets a few versions of their character to play. The other material on this DVD is good enough, but not as consistently clever. Or perhaps I just can't get enough of of Robbie Coltrane as the ghost of Christmas.",1413590400,5,599,4.714285714285714
