7943861,4,B00005LDCP,"The names Reverend Gary Davis and Sonny Terry are o strangers in this space. Anytime one wants to speak ""country blues"" those names along with those of Son House, Bukka White and Sonny's long time, if estranged playing partner come easily to mind. I first heard the Reverend Gary Davis at one of the early Newport Folk Festivals. Now listen up. I didn't like him that much them. Of course in those days it was Son House, Mississippi John Hurt and Skip James that got my attention. But Gary grows on you, especially when he gets a righteous song to tear into for about ten minutes like ""Twelve Gates Of The City"". Here ""If I Had My Way"", although not that long fills the bill. As for Sonny, needless to say when he is hot on his harmonica, as he is here on ""Hootin' The Blues""- watch out. Hey, the producers who went back to the 1960s vaults in putting together this DVD knew these guys were the masters, Taj Mahal, a great bluesman in his own right, who introduces the segments, knew they were masters, I know they are the masters and now you will too? Enough said.",1251936000,,1065,4.35678391959799
7943862,4,B00005LDCP,"Although I have seen Sonny Terry in person many times, I had never seen any footage of Reverend Gary Davis. These are two of my all time favorite artists, and here they are, together on one dvd.
The clips used, unfortunately, consist of each artist sitting on a stool without an audience, and just playing a little stiffly. However, this may be the only available video of Gary Davis, who knows. I have never seen Sonny Terry perform without Brownie McGhee, so this was a little different. Great stuff, though.
This dvd has more historical value than entertainment value, but, if you are into acoustic blues, this is wonderful.
The dvd I received, although new, did not play very well, and skipped the middle of the disc. It played well enough, though, but if I seriously want to listen to the music, I would rather play their CDs.",1222732800,2,831,4.621621621621622
7943863,5,B00005LDCP,"Two of the most rootfull bluesmen: Rev. Gary Davis and Sonny Terry, introduced by another leggend of music, Taj Majal. This video shows us the power and the glory of the songs, hymns and other compositions by Rev. Davis. With powerfull voice and a marvelous guitar he celebrates with holy grace of the Lord. Sonny Terry makes an exceptional and rare solo performance that reveals his skills as harp player and shows the very escense of whoopi'n the blues as no one ever. An exceptional testimony of two greats of the blues music ever.",977961600,5,534,4.691489361702128
