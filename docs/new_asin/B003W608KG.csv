8407291,5,B003W608KG,"I have been so impressed with  Sarah Hodgson's books about dog training; therefore, I thought I'd like to see the methods visually in a DVD format.  This IS very helpful for someone who wants a visual look at her dog training methods.  However, the DVD alone doesn't cover all the material one needs to be familier with in order to successfully use Sarah's techniques.  For that reason, I suggest buying her book entitled ""Dog Perfect"" as well as purchasing the DVD.  This is a very thorough book and should be on everyone's shelf.  I have been using her techniques with the puppy we adopted from the shelter for almost 4 weeks now and am VERY happy with the amazing results.",1367107200,2,675,4.583333333333333
8407292,1,B003W608KG,"I was disappointed in this purchase. I had read two of her books, and was looking for guidance specifically on using the teaching lead. This DVD just repeats the information and techniques described in her books, often word for word, without much additional information about the lead specifically. It would have been more appropriate as a free addition to the lead itself, and certainly wasn't worth near what I spent on it.",1321920000,,425,4.916666666666667
8407293,5,B003W608KG,"This DVD is Great! Sarah has a fascinating rapport with her canine friends.
I loved watching the ease with which she communicates with the dogs.
She is gentle yet firm and very loving.
Sarah's at ease in front of the camera and describes her techniques very clearly.
She uses positive clear commands with her pups and they respond happily.
It was a delight to watch her in action. She makes training fun and easy.",1312588800,,413,4.594594594594595
