7918550,5,B00003E46F,Excellent story telling by Burbank Studios' excellent Australian animation team  Suitable for children and possibly teens.  The Native American Indian custom of Berdache is lovingly and naturally presented.,1508544000,,206,6.321428571428571
7918551,5,B00003E46F,this is marked as 1983 but this is the 1988(i'm pretty sure) version released by Burbank Studios in Australia. The voice actors listed are correct. took a chance and ordered it and it was the same one i watched as a child.,1386374400,,222,4.309523809523809
7918552,2,B00003E46F,"I bought this hoping it would help educate my grandson, who lives in the UK; unfortunately, the people who made the movie neglected to educate themselves.  In the first minute or so, for instance, we see Hiawatha's clan gathered around their tipis; the Iroquois lived in longhouses.  The story takes place pre-European contact; yet the warriors have horses, which came over with the Spanish.  After just a few minutes, I divested myself of the notion that this might be a good educational tool; and, unfortunately, none of the other videos appear any better.  I guess I'll have to wait until the grandson is old enough to appreciate The Song of Hiawatha with Graham Greene.",1361318400,,673,4.87719298245614
