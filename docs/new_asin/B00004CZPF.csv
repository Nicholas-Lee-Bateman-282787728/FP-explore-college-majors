1339574,5,B00004CZPF,A friend had sent me a copy of this work on videotape back in the early 90s and I have been looking for it on DVD ever since.  This is some of Mike Oldfield's finest work captured the way he likes it - live and on stage.  The only drawback to this recording is that it is only presented with Region 2 DVD coding. (Thank Goodness for Region-free software patches!) Apparently his producers seem to think Mike is only popular in Europe.  Just be warned that this DVD is encoded to only play in either Region 2 or region-free DVD players.  It is well worth the effort for us Mike Oldfield fans!,1336608000,2,591,4.25
1339575,5,B00004CZPF,"Two of his best concerts ever. While Tubular Bells II is great, Tubular Bells III is out of this world. I would have given anything to be out in that audience, rain or no rain. The only downside to this DVD is that is region coded for Europe, so I can only play it on my laptop; unless I want to go out and buy a non-region coded player. I looked for a long time, trying to find one coded for the US, but this product was never coded for the US region.",1299196800,2,452,3.870967741935484
1339576,5,B00004CZPF,"First, pay attention: this is a ""REGION TWO"" disc, which won't play on Region One coded (North America) DVD players.  My solution was to get a region-free player (yes, just for this disc, although I am ordering more Region Two's from Europe now) from OPPO.  Excellent universal (including DVD-Audio and SACD) disc players for very reasonable prices, by the way.  Not cheap, but they perform above their price.

So, on to the DVD content!  I held a ""Mike Oldfield Concert Event"" in my home for the first viewing, and it was attended by long-time fans (such as myself) and people who had never heard of him.  Everyone's jaws dropped from start to finish.  The sound is great, and the on-stage performances are enthralling.  The video isn't the best, though it is very good on TBII, less so on TBIII.

By the way, many (though NOT all) DVD players can have their regional coding eliminated by the user - just Google your player's make and model number, followed by ""region free"", to see if you can find instructions - usually by using your remote control keypad.",1239062400,7,1059,4.681081081081081
1339577,5,B00004CZPF,"This is a great DVD of two live performances of Mike Oldfield.  Side One is Tubular Bells II performed live at Edinburgh Castle.  Mike and his other musicians, and the orchestra all play pretty close to the original album of Tubular Bells II.  It's rather disappointing that the ""Altered State"" segment has to be a part of his most cherished album ever.  I cringe every time I here the album go into that annoying ""caveman-like"" tangent.  It follows ""Tattoo"" (with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards"" on bagpipes) which is my favorite part of TB II.

On Side Two of the DVD, Mike and his fellow performers play his 1998 album Tubular Bells III at the Horse Guards Parade in London.  If you already bought his DVD of ""The Art in Heaven -Millennium Bell Concert"", you will see many of his same performers are with him on this performance of Tubular Bells III.

The sound quality is excellent on both sides of this DVD.  However, strangely enough, the video quality is better on the earlier TB II performance.  Not to say that TB III is bad, it's just not as good.

Now, I know everybody who likes Mike Oldfield is criticizing him for re-recording and re-packaging Tubular Bells over and over, and over again these past 30 plus years.  But, if it wasn't for the 1992 release of Tubular Bells II, I would have probably just let myself forget all about him.  I really didn't follow Mike Oldfield's music much after Crises (1983) and The Killing Fields (1984).  I didn't care for how Mike Oldfield was doing less long played projects and started to perform pop sounding ditties with other singers.  Sometimes, you wouldn't know if you were listening to Mike Oldfield or ABBA.  ""Family Man"", ""To France"", ""Moonlight Shadow"", etc.  And when I saw ""Discovery"" (1984) and seen that it had more short pop songs with vocals, I just sort of gave up on Mike Oldfield, altogether.  So I think, TB II was a smart move for Mike Oldfield to re-introduce himself to the music world.  ""Tubular Bells"" (1973) was considered an innovative Progressive Rock achievement, and so TB II of 1992 had to compete with the modern day New Age music market.  I don't think TB III is any great disappointment, but I won't give it a miss either.  To see it performed live now actually makes me appreciate the album a lot more.

And why shouldn't Mike Oldfield try and keep Tubular Bells alive?  When we go to see any singer or band in concert, we are usually not too concerned about hearing some of their new material.  We want to see and hear the hits, of course.  Especially from bands who's past is much more glorified than where they are today. However, I will say that ""Tubular Bells 2003"" is totally unnecessary.  Maybe if it were performed live, it would be considered more cherishable.  But, as a CD, I just don't need it.

OK......Now for some bad news.  This is a PAL (Non-Region 1), DVD.  Not playable on DVD players in the USA (where we are NTSC).  This was a real big disappointment for me because I bought the Samsung DVD-HD950, that has been able to play every DVD that I've bought, even from Thailand, Japan, and England.  But, for the first time, my DVD player doesn't recognize this DVD.  So, the only way I can play this DVD is on my computer.  I only have a 19"" monitor, but I do have my computer hooked up to my stereo, so I am enjoying a good picture (just smaller), and I do have fabulous sound quality.

America needs to release this DVD in the USA.  ""The Art in Heaven - Millennium Bell Concert"" use to be my favorite Mike Oldfield DVD, but now I appreciate the performances of this DVD much more.

""Exposed"" on DVD is okay but the sound and picture isn't the greatest, but it is an earlier performance (1978), and ""Live in Montreux"" (1981) is just ""okay"" as well.

Anyway, if you don't mind watching a concert performance on your computer, and if you are a Mike Oldfield fan, you should get this DVD.  Good luck finding it though, it's becoming pretty scarce.",1154131200,24,3946,4.511988716502116

7920112,5,B00004CZPF,"Some criticism from another reviewer suggested the Edinburgh show was sub standard. Bollocks to that. Bloody marvelous. Ok the Horse Guard concert was supreme tho. In the Youtube blurry version, there were a couple of tracks before the 'Secrets' finale. These are missing on the DVD performance. The finale was so worth it to those who attended as most sat thru a pretty miserable night of wet, to hear this genius at play with his fine backing bank. The sung sections were spine chilling. Awesome. I can not work out when the young girl speaks at the end, why the audience sound like they are booing.  Top watch for all Mike O fans if not seen already.

7920113,4,B00004CZPF,"I got this for the T.B. III performance - one of the best live concerts I've ever seen captured on video. Brilliant all around - the band is phenomenal, every one of them a virtuoso, Oldfield's score is magnificent and his playing has never been better than here. I give the presentation 4 stars because instead of 2 discs it's one two sided disc and the side with T. B. II came with a big circular scratch going all the way around the disk rendering it unplayable. Poor quality control.",1430611200,,487,4.4222222222222225

7920115,4,B00004CZPF,"Being that Mike Oldfield concerts are a rarity in Australia, I'm glad that I can get a chance to see two of my favourite albums played ""live""' right in the comfort of my home. I only have one other 2 sided DVD in my collection so it's a bit odd to think this is still done.",1372464000,,273,3.892857142857143
7920116,4,B00004CZPF,I really enjoyed tubular II since I have had the CD for years.  Really enjoyed seeing the Scotland concert again.  First saw it on PBS many years ago.  I had to buy a player that plays Region 2 which I also purchased from Amazon and it worked fine.  Tubular III is nice but just not as enjoyable to me as the II.,1359504000,,312,3.9838709677419355

7920118,2,B00004CZPF,"I would have liked to have known in advance that this DVD could not be played on a U.S. DVD player. Could it have killed you folks at Amazon to put some obvious disclaimers to the rest of us with a U.S.address; without having us need to understand ""region codes"" and what it means to our purchase decision. I realize that Amazon seems to be doing well but after ordering kitchen canisters that cut your hand while opening, defective Motorola phones and now this, I think its time to shop elsewhere.",1356566400,,498,4.483516483516484
