5341249,2,B009IY4ESS,"I was extremely disappointed with this documentary. There was so much hype for it, but it is not what I expected. It's listed as a documentary, but it's really just a bunch of different interviews slapped together with Al Snow intros. For Ultimo Dragon, they had him speaking very broken english, but for Keijih Mutoh aka Great Muta, he spoke in Japanese with English subtitles. Why couldn't Ultimo do the same? The interviews were mostly just typical with no real deep conversation. The questions asked were pretty much what any regular fan would ask, and the responses were typical, much like an interview with a basketball player after a game. They just scratched the surface. You would  be better off buying shoot interviews. Don't waste your money. Just look up the Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) interview on YouTube. Hers, Christian's, and RVD's were the best on here.",1386720000,2,873,4.938775510204081
5341250,1,B009IY4ESS,"I had high hopes for this movie, but they were tempered by the reviews I read, so my expectations were considerably lower, yet this still disappointed.
No one really said anything that hadn't been said before... Chris Jericho didn't speak much beyond Fozzy, and the Mick Foley segment was quite literally just him telling a joke and doing a book signing.
I'm not upset that I spent four dollars to rent this... I'm upset that I spent two hours of my life on this.
I had been watching the production and this was supposed to be cutting edge.  This was nothing of the sort.
Avoid it, unless you want to be disappointed, as well.",1380499200,3,626,4.491228070175438
5341251,2,B009IY4ESS,"This is a piss poor over expensive video. There is not one match or clip in the video to highlight the commentary.
Its as boring as can be, and there is nothing that isn't already known. Not anything exclusive.

The Title Bloodstained Memoirs is totaly misleading. I was looking for Wrestling bouts where somebody was bleeding
for thier profession, and it was all yak yak yak. There are no Wrestling bouts to help the non story at all. There's nothing !

Jericho has suckered me into another Wrestlers nothing new Video thats a total drag. This Video crawls out of the mud,
rolls over in crap, and goes back for more. I didn't bother to finish it.

 Blab, Blab, Blab. Yakkety Yakkety Yak ! For a Man who has been around the Ring as much as Jericho, Its clear that he has lost any speaking ability he learned in school. The many hits to his head  have taken thier toll. As much as I love watching him perform, being a Face, or a Heel, he just can talk up even a video.",1365033600,4,967,4.291208791208791
5341252,1,B009IY4ESS,"This doc is almost unbearably boring. Nothing new is said. ""The Most Anticipated Wrestling Doc of All-time?"" Just a lame gimmick, and obviously a worked one from the beginning. Do not waste your money.",1359590400,2,201,4.9411764705882355
5341253,4,B009IY4ESS,"Not the best wrestling documentary, but worth a watch if you're a die hard wrestling fan like myself. I expected more coming from the hype. But great info and included my favorite wrestler of all time...Lion Heart Chris Jericho! Best in the world!",1358121600,6,247,4.767441860465116
5341254,2,B009IY4ESS,"This documentary is good but nowhere near great. It's a series of individual interviews, each about 15-20 minutes long, about some of each of the wrestler's personal experiences. With the exception of Chris Jericho. His entire interview is devoted to his rock band Fozzy. Nothing is mentioned or asked of his wrestling career. Maybe because at the time of this interview, it was one of the many times he wasn't an active wrestler. With all due respect to Ultimo Dragon and his ability, English must be his 3rd or 4th language. He cannot communicate. Same with The Great Muta. But his interview is subtitled. He legitimately cannot speak English. The intros by Al Snow are nothing special. The questions that the interviewer asks are pretty generic and elementary at best. They're nothing in depth. They're basic questions that even the most novice wrestling fan could ask. The best interviews are given by Roddy Piper and Nora Greenwald. Again, nothing earth shattering but good nonetheless. Jimmy Snuka, Christian, and Rob Van Dam get kinda boring after a while. The Mick Foley interview was absolutely pointless. It wasn't an interview at all. All of it is footage taken from a book signing appearance he makes at a Borders bookstore. And it's rather boring. It's as if the only reason his name is on the DVD is to sell more copies. Overall, if you're looking for hard hitting questions and behind the curtain stories. this isn't for you. This is fluff material at best. Any true wrestling fan should probably rent this and not buy it. After watching this, I didn't learn anything new and had no true insights on the wrestlers who were interviewed. As a lifelong wrestling fan, I really felt like my time was wasted and my intelligence insulted.",1353888000,5,1747,4.846153846153846

8542154,3,B009IY4ESS,I like having this one in my collection but I mainly think it's great because of Keiji Mutoh and Yoshiro Asai (Ultimo Dragon).  It's rare to see interviews with these two living legends.,1430265600,,186,4.636363636363637

8542158,3,B009IY4ESS,"Some good segments, some rather mundane. Mick Foley is always entertaining, RVD was very well spoken, Chris Jericho would have been more interesting if he'd been allowed to speak more to his wrestling career.",1394668800,,208,5.147058823529412
8542159,1,B009IY4ESS,Just a bunch of botched together interview . I usualy love interviews with Mick Foley as I find him funny since I saw him on Larry King .But his part was just taped at a book store . quick buck bull s***,1389139200,,203,3.857142857142857
