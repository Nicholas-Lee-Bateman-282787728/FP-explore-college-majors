203229,5,1933424478,This is based on newer evidence of the shroud not what you heard years ago. I believe it is a must see. It contains scientific evidence for those who are a doubting Thomas.,1394409600,,172,4.242424242424242
203230,5,1933424478,"This is AN AWESOME Documentary.  Highly recommend it!  It goes about proving that Christ not only lived, but died and gives absolute proof of his resurrection.",1360195200,,159,5.076923076923077
203231,5,1933424478,"This DVD is great.  It's full of amazing facts that make it pretty clear that Jesus did in fact rise from the grave.

I also consider this a great evangelism tool for loaning out or giving to non-believers who are skeptical about the facts and proof behind the resurrection.

And don't forget to watch the extras on the disk, there are even more amazing facts presented by various scientists to authenticate the Shroud of Turin.  Amazing!",1331856000,4,438,4.723684210526316
203232,5,1933424478,"Jesus is alive! I have seen Him & He has spoken to me as well as my angel. I have died several times & there is life so wonderful beyond this I wish I never had to have come back to this place! It will not be all that long before He returns & if you are like warm in your heart about who Jesus is He will spew you out & you will never know the love I know that is beyond any human words to describe it. A warmth & peace that makes you never fear death again, but welcome it knowing what is to come on the other side.",1471478400,2,516,3.6160714285714284

203235,5,1933424478,"I've been interested in the Shroud for 5 or 6 years now, and try to read all new articles that come out, both positive and negative. I think proving the Shroud is not the burial cloth of Christ would be in some ways just as important as proving that it is. If the thing is not genuine, I want to know. So do most serious Shroud researchers.

While Shroudies are often blamed of ignoring any evidence that doesn't support authenticity, just look through the vast repository of PDF's contained on Barrie Schwortz's website and you'll see that this assertion has little basis in fact. Most of the folks involved in Shroud research are quite serious scientists. Many, like Barrie, aren't Christians. Intellectual curiosity and passion is the common element that seems to drive most of them, like Ray Rogers, who believed that anybody questioning the 1988 carbon 14 dating was engaging in ridiculous wishful thinking, until he took up the challenge himself, finding conclusions that forced him to change his viewpoint.

Some Shroud movies present mostly the pro-authenticity evidence, sometimes without really explaining it in detail, and without mentioning the peer reviewed research that may question the findings. This movie covers a truly comprehensive array of the scientific inquiries that have been done, along with explanations and animations that bring these theories and potential evidence alive. They don't ignore opposing theories either. It's easy to call the Shroud a fake when you only look at a handful of things, and rely on nothing but the uncertain carbon 14 dating from 1988, and Walter McCrone's supposed paint theory, which has been widely discredited by highly reputable sources, not fringe lunatics.

I am not suggesting we assume that the Shroud is the real thing. But if there is so much as a .1% chance that it is, it may offer insight into the most important questions facing humanity. As such, anybody with intellectual depth should be able to understand why it is imperative that we continue to investigate the Shroud until we can truly rule it out as possible evidence of both the Divine and the Afterlife.",1460073600,3,2132,5.0

203240,5,1933424478,"Surprisingly, provides convincing extra-Biblical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead that I had not seen before, and which is probably not well known. It's worth watching.",1454198400,5,195,5.533333333333333
203241,3,1933424478,"The production values are fine. It reads as any other competently produced documentary. Production values are not where this film falls short. The major failing of the film are evidence and analysis. The producers cite non-biblical evidence for resurrection without specifically identifying the sources or holding them up to scholarly analysis. The non-biblical texts are a minor element in the story. For the most part the film uses references from the Bible to verify the accuracy of claims made in the bible. It is in short an exercise in circular reasoning. Even if one finds a way to get around this, and the fact that carbon 14 dating indicates a medieval provenance for the shroud, there is no physical evidence linking the shroud to the person of Jesus.",1449964800,2,761,4.953125

7801755,5,1933424478,"Many of men have tried with zero proof of life without Christ. Yet this is only one of numerous videos and books available that go into many other accounts of God and Christ with facts proven and evidence at hand. Why, must humans try so hard to come up with nothing but theory's to attempt to disprove God and Christ, calling the bible nothing but fairy

why do human's try so hard to disprove God, Christ, the bible and replace them with nothing but crazy theories when there are tons of movies and books that show proof and tangible evidence that supports God, Christ, and biblical accounts? Maybe they are just afraid that there is a creator that they know if they admit to, they will also have to be accountable for their sins one day. Another great movie here, and there is more out there that show evidence ie. Dead Sea Scrolls, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah and evidence of the locations talked about along with evidence leading to its demise by God as He promised. A ton of factual information proven by many that intended to disprove the bible and later had to admit their faith that Christ is EXACTLY who He said He is.",1473465600,5,1132,4.4423076923076925
7801756,5,1933424478,Objective and informative. As a Christian I've never doubted Jesus's resurrection but I find it exciting to see definitive proof. Especially from secular sources.
