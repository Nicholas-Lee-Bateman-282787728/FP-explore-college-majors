774941,5,6304052871,"This is one that had me jumping behind the couch when I was 10.  Though some reviewers write this story off as rubbish, its one of my personal favorites. I think its because, like much of Hinchcliffe's Who, time and effort go into generating suspense and horror through image, through what we see as much as through plot and character, the two complementing each other, and the story being propelled as much by image as dialogue. The hideous, pig brained ""Peking Homonculous"" in the Talons of Weng Chiang is a good example of this.

In Face of Evil, potent images of horror abound. Examples include the perpetual twighlight of the forest, the red, purple and black tones dominating the production design, in the fact that we don't see the monster at first, only its effect on the environment (an idea that resurfaced, along with the plastic jungle, in the similarly titled ""Face of Evil."") There also is palpable fear generated by surveyors' scruffiness and dirtiness, their desperate rushes through the haunted wood, and the horrific look of their wizened corpses after the monster gets them. The look on Sarah's face when the monster almost gets her is another terrifying (to the 10 year old inside us all) image used in this story.

And the terror is relentless. The suspense builds as the action shifts to the Morestran spaceship. Sorenson's glowing eyes after he morphs into ""anti-man,"" the steaming potion he must gulp (like Dr. Jeckyll) to keep his demons at bay, the corpses ditched from the ship plunging into the endless loneliness of deep space.... all unforgettable images terrifying to the mind of an imaginative 10 year old.

If there was a secret to Hinchcliffe's success as a producer it was this.

Another appealing quality of the Face of Evil is its ending. We get the right sort of closure and denoument, providing the necessary antidote to terror, and thus making it a horror story suitable for kids....(read no further if you're worried by the ending being spoilt.) Sorenson survives, his life is spared by the antimatter force, indicating it is not evil as the title suggests, only misunderstood.

Some Who fans think Sorenson's survival is absurd, out of kilter with his crimes and irresponsibilities, forgetting that ethically speaking, the need to save a dying planet outweighs the deaths of afew individuals. Furthermore, Sorenson's survival is necessitated by the dramatic logic of the script....the Morestrans must have, at the very least, a chance of overcoming the problem of their dying sun for the horror to be truly assuaged. The Doctor empathises with Sorenson, as a fellow scientist and traveller, and suggests alternative sources of energy for his planet.

 The moral questions raised by this story exemplify what I like most about Dr. Who (and other great science fiction.) Though the show has a fantastic setting, it is preoccupied with our own moral universe.

Sometimes reviewers forget that Dr Who was a show devised to scare children (in a  way that all children want to be scared, in the comfort and safety of their living rooms) and start expecting ridiculously high standards. They want perfect acting and special effects, hole-less plots....they forget that the ""feeling tone"" i.e. the emotional mood of drama is as important as the plot details...more important in Dr Who's case, as it is dreamlike... it deals with realms of the imagination, where absurdities and illogicallities abound. We would miss out on countless great stories if Dr. Who were constrained by dramatic realism.

Makers of kids TV rarely bother to scare children any more.  They're all too preoccupied with values laden, politically correct (and mindnumbingly boring) shows about teenagers who think, act, and talk like adults (part of Dr. Who's appeal to me as a kid was the absence of precocious child actors.) Kids get enough of this at school. Soul sucking monsters, mad scientists, aliens who plot to conquer the universe, body counts, the stuff of nightmare and imagination, antidotes to the dull fare of most English classrooms, are all things of the past as far as makers of kid's TV are concerned (my child's heart cries out for another Monkey, another Dr Who.) No wonder the Harry Potter series is so successful. Its fulfilling a deep seated need children have to be frightened out of their wits. The horror element to both series also explains why adults appreciate them as much as children. Thank God not all the episodes of Dr Who were incinerated in the BBC vaults. I'm particularly thankful ""Planet of Evil"" survived.",1098835200,9,4550,4.980237154150197
774942,4,6304052871,"There was a trilogy of Tom Baker stories during the shows ""Golden Age"" which bid homage to the classics of Gothic horror fiction -- ""The Brain of Morbius"" (Frankenstein); ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" (Dracula); and, of course, ""Planet of Evil"" which was essentially Dr. Jekkyl & Mr. Hyde in space. This episode is inferior to ""Talons"" (what isn't?) and not as much fun as ""Morbius"" but it is still a good outing, concentrating far less on humor and camp and more on the classic elements of Gothic horror -- tampering with forbidden knowledge, the internal struggle of good vs. evil, and the mounting terror of a group which is trapped in a haunted house (so to speak) and being picked off one by one. Like ""Talons"" which also mixed in homages to Phantom of the Opera and the real-life Jack the Ripper killings, this story also borrows heavily from ""Forbidden Planet"" in its choice of a semi-invisible monster projected, more or less, from it's victims own minds. There are also less-than-subtle moral messages about colonialism and gross exploitation of the environment, which is always humorous when you consider the Brits spent 300 years doing just that to our little planet. I guess Orwell was right when he said that hypocrisy is THE English vice (then again, he also said, ""The Americans always have to go you one better on any type of beastliness"" so you can read it either way).
The story is your basic 'trapped in a haunted house with a mysterious killer' bit, but the overlapping plot elements and homages prevent it from falling into parody. Tom Baker plays the Doctor with less humor and more edge in this outing, not troubling to hide his disgust at what he sees as militaristic fools tampering with forces they don't understand, and expressing his usual lack of patience with those less intelligent than himself, which in this story is absolutely everybody. The (relative) humorlessness of the normally cheeky, campy Doc helps underscore the mounting sense of doom. As always, the guest characters help to make the episode. Professor Sorenson, the Jekkyl/Hyde character, is both creepy and pitiable with his sunken, bleary eyes, stubbly face, and mixture of nervousness and exhaustion; he is more complex than your average guest character and it is difficult to see if he will play out as a villain or a hero. Not so with Controller Salamar, a ship's captain so repressed and stuck-up not only would butter not melt in his mouth, but if you inserted a lump of coal into this bloke's you-know-what, in thirty seconds you'd have a diamond. What Salamar lacks in charm, me makes up for with his shoot first, ask-questions-never style of command. Finally there is Vishinsky, the kindly veteran X.O., who seems to have gotten the helping of common sense that Salamar missed out on when he was going back to the buffet for a second course of being a jackass. All of these actors work well.
One interesting feature of the story is its violence. This episode has a huge body count and there are times I half-expected to hear that creepy ""ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha"" music from ""Friday the 13th"" as our heroes stumble around in the jungle, waiting to die.
Speaking of which, ""Planet's"" biggest strength is its creepy production design -- Zeta Minor, where most of the story takes place, is strange, jungle-like, very alien and claustrophobic, perfect to the atmosphere of the story. The black pit from whence the creature emerges is truly eerie-looking, and a very nice bit of prop-work, especially the fake bubbles which give it the illusion of depth. And the ship, which serves as the final battleground has an unpleasant, overbright 'death trap' feel to it.
One minor quibble -- when the irradiated Sorenson does his slavering, shamelessly over-the-top Mr. Hyde routine, it takes a will of iron not to burst out into hysterical laughter. Blaaaaah! Yeaaaaahh! Grrrrrr! Trick or treat! He hardly needed to strangle his victims; they would have laughed themselves into heart attacks anyway. This aside, ""Planet"" is one of the more downright creepy episodes shot during Baker's run, and it does an effective job of putting our heroes through one wringer after another before the Tardis whisks off on its next adventure.",1068076800,6,4213,4.901960784313726
774943,5,6304052871,Planet of Evil is an amazing story prbably one of the creapist of the Doctor Who stories from the 4th Doctor's era. It saw them land on a planet called Zeta Minor in the far future. The Doctor battling an unknown entity controled  by antiMatter. What more can i say very enjoyable story. Tom Baker at his best.,1038009600,,310,4.344827586206897
774944,4,6304052871,"The year--37,166.  The place:  Zeta Minor, at the fringes of the known universe.  The surviving members of a Morestran survey team are being killed off by an invisible force in a way that resembles ""a rapid form of freeze drying.""  Dr. Sorenson is on the verge of a scientific discovery that could save the Morestran civilization--their sun is dying.  Baldwin, a member of the expedition, manages to activate an SOS as he is being attacked.  Guess who answers the SOS?  A certain jelly-baby loving Time Lord and his assistant.
Also en route to Zeta Minor is a military expedition headed by the young and inexperienced Controller, Salamar.  The Doctor and Sarah are captured by Salamar's troops and accused of murdering seven members of Sorenson's expedition.  They escape, only to encounter the cause of the deaths at the cliffhanger to Episode 1.  Speaking of cliffhangers, the one ending Episode 2 is effective, as the Doctor is seen falling into the black pit, seemingly doomed.
All the great lines are by the Doctor, but this one covers the overall concept of colonial thinking and Sorenson's mission:  ""Here on Zeta Minor is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other universe which you don't understand.  You call it 'nothing' a word term to cover ignorance, and centuries ago, scientists invented another name for it:  anti-matter.  And you, by coming here, have crossed that boundary into that other Universe to plunder it.""  Sorensen, however, puts it another wayL  ""Full scale exploitation of this planet will provide us with perpetual energy in whatever way we need it.""  The main point being that Sorenson cannot take any minerals of that planet with him.  In the meantime, Sorenson's men are being killed off one by one.
Prentis Hancock's impatient action-not-waiting Salamar is a retread of his portrayal as Vaber in Planet Of The Daleks.  But Ewen Solon takes top honors as the older and wiser voice of reason, a variation of the Trojan War's Nestor, as second-in-command Vishinsky.
Other notes:  The anti-matter monster, despite being shown corporeally on the video cover, is only seen as a glowing yellow outline, which is an interesting way.  And Elizabeth Sladen's expression, especially her eyes, brilliantly portray that feeling of her mind leaving her body, a sensation she feels whenever the anti-creature is near.  The casualty rate is also high in this story.
By Episode Three, there is a clear Jekyll and Hyde theme established.  The larger theme is that of anti-colonialism, a theme previously explored in the Who story The Mutants.  Figures, since the British Empire plundered resources of countries in its domain.  And with this story, the British, by experience, portrays the immorality of exploiting other countries for their wealth.  Sounds like a country I'm familiar with.  A worthy story in the Dr. Who canon.",1032566400,2,2861,5.044776119402985
774945,4,6304052871,"This was always one of my favorite episodes as a kid, and as an adult I watch it and marvel. They literally just don't make 'em like this anymore. In fact, they can't; a budget, capable acting and a more plausible script would get in the way of all the fun. The story is of course preposterous, the acting laughable [Salomar has to be the biggest idiot ever given command of a space crew in the history of Sci Fi] and the special effects are so goofy that you have to laugh the first time the show the Space Probe (where was Derrick Meddings when they needed him?). Well, so what. That's why I watch Dr. Who in the first place, thank you. I revel in the cheap, shoddy interior sets [dig the office supply store chairs on the command deck], grin from ear to ear at the histrionics of the actors [""Psycho-Stimulators Not Responding!!""] and would love to slog through that space jungle they created on a soundstage. In fact, the most effective sequences are the ones set in the jungle and shot on film, especially Baldwin's hectic run through the jungle right at the beginning of the episode and then the unforgettable Occuloid Tracker (great name for a band) following The Doctor and Sarah through the lush, purple plastic and coaxial cable foliage. I will always be a kid when I watch Dr Who episodes like this one from the Tom Baker years, and that is what makes it such brilliant trash -- (...)you can be 13 again any time you pop this tape in the machine. Sounds like an equitable price to get your youth back for an hour and a half. Recommended.",1007164800,4,1548,4.416083916083916

774947,4,6304052871,"""Planet of Evil"" is one of those routinely underrated great stories of Doctor Who, somehow having been overwhelmed by the adventures surrounding it. Really, it's quite a good story: basically, it's the DW version of the film ""Forbidden Planet"", with some nice Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde material thrown in towards the end.
Tom Baker and Lis Sladen are on their usual par (beginning a long run of popular stories with the Doctor and Sarah travelling together, without Harry), and David Maloney once again provides solid direction. The guest stars again stand out - most notably Frederick Jaeger - and there's nothing much to fault! Even the effects are pretty good for the time, although at times they are still rather negligible.
If you've tried the more well-known Tom Baker adventures from the period, such as ""Genesis of the Daleks"" or ""Pyramids of Mars"", give this one a whirl - you might enjoy it!",995846400,3,897,4.8311688311688314
774948,3,6304052871,"The nightmarish, tenebristic jungle planet sets are justly celebrated, and its concept of antimatter as a life form is intriguing.  But I think this is relatively weak for the early Tom Baker era.  It's so quiet that it's  more dull than ominous, plot elements seem to charge in right before  they're needed, and the antimatter creatures look like string cheese.

775132,5,6304052871,"The Planet of Evil sounds rather alarming, but it is my three year old's favorite Dr. Who (even more that the Robot one).  The otherwise peaceful creature on the planet dehydrates the visiting humans who are pilfering its antimatter (depicted as yellow crystals).  The lead scientist, who is a fanatic, is obsessed with the antimatter because he sees it as the salvation of their home planet, whose sun is dying, and he doesn't notice that every single one of his colleagues has died!  That is really saying something about scientists!  When Dr. Who arrives with the friendly Sarah to help to resolve the situation, their arrival coincides with the arrival of a ship from the human's home planet, sent to see what's going on with the expedition.  The home ship's captain, a stunningly handsome man but lacking in intelligence, assumes that Dr. Who and Sarah are the murderers.  This creates an interesting sub-plot and the assistant captain ends up fighting with the younger captain to save Dr. Who and Sarah from being thrown into space.  The funnest part is where the scientist becomes a crazy killer werewolf creature and clones himself into multiple versions.  My son loves that part.

I find the antimatter theme to be a little odd: I mean, contact of matter with antimatter releases pure energy, but they are handling the antimatter, so that part needs a clever explanation.  Maybe there is an alternate Universe (an antimatter Universe) wrapped around the antimatter, and in order to merge the alternate Universe with our (matter-based) Universe, there needs to be a black hole introduced to create a wormhole between the Universes, something like that!",1431648000,,1660,5.003636363636364

775214,4,6304052871,"""Planet of Evil"" brilliantly showcases the work of designer Roger Murray-Leach, whose previous work included ""The Ark in Space"" and who would go on to design perhaps the most stylish and atmospheric Doctor Who story ever, ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang."" The jungle he built for ""Planet of Evil"" on a shoestring at Ealing Studios is one of the best sets ever done for Doctor Who and constitutes almost a character in itself. Compare Murray-Leach's Zeta Minor to the set for any alien planet you can remember from Star Trek and you will begin to understand why Doctor Who is indeed the greatest science-fiction series ever created.

The story itself borrows heavily from two sources, Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and the sci-fi movie classic ""Forbidden Planet,"" which in turn borrowed heavily from Shakespeare's ""The Tempest."" The Doctor and Sarah respond to a distress call from the planet Zeta Minor at about the same time a military mission from the planet Morestra arrives to rescue a team of stranded research scientists. Something is killing the scientists one by one, and by the time rescuers arrive, the only remaining survivor is Dr. Sorenson (Frederick Jaeger), who is obsessed with the properties of strange crystals found on the planet.

The killer is an anti-matter monster retaliating for Dr. Sorenson's theft of crystal samples from a pit that serves as a gateway between the two alternate universes. The Morestrans suspect the Doctor and Sarah are responsible for the deaths of the scientists and later members of the rescue team. So the plot is a fairly simple one: the Doctor and Sarah must convince the Morestrans of their innocence and then persuade them to leave the crystals behind so their ship can escape Zeta Minor.

Meanwhile, exposure to the the crystals is transmuting Dr. Sorenson into a Hyde-like monster who is also killing members of the Morestran crew. ""Planet of Evil"" posed a singular acting challenge to the cast because the anti-matter monster is essentially a special effect created by color separation overlay who never really makes contact with his victims. The actors have to interact with a monster that's never really there.

This was Elisabeth Sladen's favorite Doctor Who story, and it's easy to see why: she was allowed to work on an actual set rather than run around in a quarry; the supporting cast, an ensemble handpicked by director David Maloney, was uniformly excellent; and her interaction with Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor was never more natural.",1310169600,2,2519,5.019138755980861
775215,5,6304052871,"A distress call broadcast by an expeditionary research and mining group on Zeta Minor, at the fringe of the Universe, is detected by their rescue ship and by The Doctor [Tom Baker] and Sarah Jane Smith [Elisabeth Sladen] as well. The Doctor and Sarah arrive first in The Tardis only to discover the dehydrated corpses of the Zeta Minor party lying about here and there.

When the rescue team subsequently shows up the lone living member of the group, a somewhat addled research professor, reveals himself. The Doctor and Sarah are immediately accused of the murders and the spaceship rescue crew leader orders the confinement of the two... but they soon escape their captors by running into the surrounding surreal and swampy jungle.

The professor has secretly discovered a cache of anti-matter which he views as necessary to his home planet, where the sun is dying, to provide necessary energy. But he doesn't realize the vast danger of removing it from the edge of another dimension on which the planet borders.

As night falls an energy being, the creature responsible for all of the killing to that point, emerges from its jungle pit to reclaim the professor's anti-matter cache. The spaceship, carrying The Doctor and Sarah, attempts to leave the planet. The ship doesn't progress very far before the creature begins to retrieve it, along with everyone on board. The group leader and The Doctor remain at odds on who stands responsible for all the deaths as well as the issue of how to best escape from the planet... but more killings follow and the energy creature is nowhere around!

775216,5,6304052871,"A solid, quality production, of an often overlooked story in the early Tom Baker era. ""Planet of Evil"" is often overlooked not because it isn't a great story, which it is,  but because it is in the middle of a run of Doctor Who masterpiece stories unmatched in WHO history. Even a great story like ""Planet of Evil"" can be overlooked if it is flanked by the likes of ""Ark in Space"", ""Genesis of the Daleks"", ""Pyramids of Mars"", ""Brain of Morbius"", ""Seeds of Doom"", and so on.  ""Planet of Evil"" was produced in the middle of the era known to WHO fans as the ""Hinchcliffe/Holmes"" era, (after Producer Philip Hinchcliffe, and script editor / writer Robert Holmes) an era considered by many to be the finest in WHO history.

This story, from 1975, holds up remarkably well in a modern era accustomed to CGI special effects.  The superb writing, acting and production imagination of Classic WHO in this era has the viewer's imagination overcoming any minor special effects glitches.  Indeed, the new series of Doctor Who, in production since 2005, suffers greatly in comparison to this superb era of Classic Doctor Who, as even spectacular CGI effects cannot overcome sub-par writing and the obvious lack of imagination evident in many modern story lines.

To discuss this story scene-by-scene would spoil it for a new viewer, who deserves to experience this excellent story for themselves, so this review will focus on the extras that make this DVD such a great value. The many extras, along with this great story from WHO's finest era, include two documentaries, a photo section and a 1975 studio scene with Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen during the production of ""Planet of Evil"".  Most interesting, however is the commentary and production notes that can be enabled during viewing.  The commentary is with Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Philip Hinchcliffe, and Prentis Hancock, and will prove most interesting to the long-time WHO fan.

The new viewer should probably watch the show in broadcast form first, and return for a 2nd/3rd, etc viewing with commentary/ notes enabled.  The veteran WHO fan, already familiar with the story, may well choose to view it with commentary and notes enabled. Be prepared for fun, laughs, some sadness, and many surprises as the commentary rolls along with the story.

A stand-out commentary for me, was by Tom Baker, about 7.5 minutes from story start.  His poignant comment , to Elisabeth Sladen, was ""I don't think I've ever been as truly happy....as I was then...with you Elisabeth"".  To which Lis Sladen replied, ""It was such a good time...me too, Tom...it was great"".  Tom Baker DOES seem to have been at his best, when he had the reliable, wonderfully talented Lis Sladen to interact with. When Lis left WHO after ""Hand of Fear"", Tom's performances gradually moved toward less serious and more flippant.  Viewing Lis Sladen as the solid foundation that Tom's ""Doctor"" worked best from, seems to explain his gradual downtrend, evidenced by his steadily declining viewing figures, in Seasons 15-to-18. With Lis Sladen, Seasons 12-to-14, Tom's viewing audience increased every season.

Oh, well, that's just speculation on my part.  But the informative, eye-opening commentaries on the Doctor Who DVD's will often get the veteran WHO fan speculating in just such a way!

To sum up, the ""Planet of Evil"" DVD is a high-quality production at a good price.  The extras alone are worth the money.  Adding a superb story from Doctor Who's finest era, makes this DVD a bargain hard to pass by.  By the end of the story, the viewer will be scratching their head, wondering why ""Planet of Evil"" is one of those WHO stories so often overlooked!",1282694400,4,3669,4.914100486223663

The sets for the planet are also pretty amazing, when you consider the amount of time and energy that had to go into creating an alient forest.

775350,4,6304052871,"This was the first Doctor Who story I had ever watched, and as a young child, it hooked me fast.

The story involves the plot of a scientist to harness the power of antimatter found on a planet at the edge of the known universe.  Straddling this universe and the universe of antimatter is a mysterious creature often likened to the ID monster of Forbidden Planet.  Professor Sorenson becomes ""infected"" with antimatter and becomes ""Anti-Man.""

Obviously, it's the Doctor's job to save these lunatics from themselves.

The planet's jungle sets have often been lauded as some of the best work the BBC has done, and I concur.  The sets and the story are all fantastic, although the rescue ship's bridge seems a bit spartan (all the money was spent on the jungle).

The acting wavers a bit, as there are some lows (Prentis Hancock sometimes overacts as the inflexible by-the-book and over-the-top commander of a rescue party; a few death scenes are also over-acted) and some highs(Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith is always wonderful, and Tom Baker's switching between dettachment and intense involvement is very ""Doctorish"").

Bonus features of the disc are on-par with other Dr. Who titles.",1209686400,,1192,4.954773869346734

775353,4,6304052871,"""Planet of Evil"" is probably the moodiest and most atmospheric ""Doctor Who"" serial to come from Philip Hinchcliffe's tenure as producer.  There's a scary monster only ever seen in outline; a dark jungle set dripping with reds, greens and purples; a near 100% fatality rate among the incidental characters; and a more somber than ever Tom Baker (sans his clownish scarf for more than half the story).

The story marks an interesting contrast against today's digitally animated and faster-paced ""Doctor Who"" episodes.  The making-of featurette on the ""Planet"" DVD effectively contrasts the story's lumbering pace between a faster-cut moment from ""Rose"", the first episode of the new series.  However, although ""Planet of Evil"" looks as dated as you might expect for something made over 30 years ago, there are still some interesting touches in the direction.  Under the eye of David Maloney, who always brought something inventive to the camera, here we have multi-level sets and Hitchcockian camera angles stalking the characters from impossibly high up in the studio.  The DVD extras give us 51 seconds of studio outtakes in which Maloney encourages Baker and Lis Sladen to scream and keep screaming while his crew struggle to bring the Chroma-key monster on-screen.  It used to be said that this story influenced the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and it's easy to see why.

Apart from a crisp DVD presentation, the story is let down on a few sides.  The red-outlined anti-matter monster (a blatant homage to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000HEWEDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;disappears in the second half of the story, to be replaced by an ineffectively lumbering stunt double for Frederick Jaeger (playing accidental bad guy Professor Sorenson).  The acting style is very stagey and doesn't hold up so well today; Prentis Hancock plays an emotionally unhinged starship captain without a hint of psychological subtlety.  This is redeemed of course by Hancock's own contribution to the DVD commentary track, as he sets out such a compelling case for his character's motivation that it's a shame it wasn't incorporated into the actual script.

The rest of the cast is sadly disposable, as most of the starship crew serve the purpose of redshirts who have more effort put into their death screams than into their characters.  The sole exception there is someone named Graham Weston, who adds some insight into the DVD extra features and whose character gets some of the lone grasps of comedy in the entire story.

Finally, the story itself makes little sense.  Although Baker as always sells his explanation with terrific conviction (""Sorenson, if you don't remove the anti-matter from the ship you won't be allowed to leave this planet!""), the plot doesn't hold up once you start thinking about the story's core concept of a Jekyll-and-Hyde planet.  Why does the anti-matter monster continue to kill even after the Doctor ""promised"" he'd return the stolen anti-matter crystals?  How does Sorenson have an oral ""anti-quark"" antidote to the crystals' poison even before he's infected?  Why does the captain not flinch (or even appear to notice) when his first three crewmen are killed, but suddenly goes nuts after DeHaan dies?

That said, this story's an obvious influence on modern ""Who"" episodes such as ""The Impossible Planet"" and ""42"", so it's hard to dismiss.  One advantage to the classic ""Who"" episodes being released one episode at a time rather than season-by-season is that a story like ""Planet of Evil"" gets to receive deluxe treatment at the hands of the Restoration Team.  With nearly an hour of explanatory material -- including a lengthy easter egg of producer Hinchcliffe narrating the story's production file -- any faults that may have developed in ""Planet of Evil"" after 30-plus years of repeat viewings are now easily glossed over.",1205020800,3,4166,5.644230769230769
775354,5,6304052871,"In this compelling ""Doctor Who"" adventure at the edge of the known universe we have a perfect example of this show's gift for flirting with mediocrity only to come out shining. ""Planet of Evil""--even the title sounds like a bad direct-to-video B movie. But don't let that fool you. Many a plot element shows visible traces of influence from prior tales in the genre, most noticeably ""Doctor Jeckyll and Mister Hyde""--elements that with the slightest mishandling could end up as trite, corny, plagiaristic, and, well, plain dull. But worry not. They are carefully and subtly invoked, reworked, and integrated into a thrillingly original and well-written story with consummate creativity and flair, not to mention a bit of the alchemist's touch for turning lead into gold.

The story is given quite a bit of depth and atmosphere by its convincingly rendered bizarre setting: Zeta Minor, a dangerously remote planet on the furthest fringes of the known universe as of the 37000's AD, a spookily surreal jungle world that makes Yoda's Dagobah look like your average backyard garden in comparison, and right in the midst of this lies an abyss linking our familiar cosmos of matter and being with one of antimatter and non-being. Something not to be trifled with lightly, which is of course just what happens, setting the story in motion. Civilization has exhausted its energy sources and is near collapse, and so a geological expedition led by a certain Professor Sorenson has come to this uncanny place in hopes of harnessing the supposedly limitless power of antimatter, enraging a mostly invisible but monstrous being from the other side and poisoning Sorenson himself in the process. And into this devolving disaster are dragged both a military rescue ship and (of course) the Doctor and Sarah Jane in the Tardis.

Here again as is often the case the writers for ""Doctor Who"" show an unusual talent for painting the portrait of a whole society of the future in all of its complexity with only a few deft lines of dialogue woven unobtrusively and organically into the script. There is also inherent in this adventurous tale an understated but definite ecological fable examining the responsibilities of the scientific enterprise in a manner delightfully neither preachy nor burdensome. Sorenson himself is the very archetype of the obsessed mad scientist, but what could have been a tired stock character is brilliantly enlivened and fleshed out by fine acting of the very first order. This is mostly true of the rest of the supporting cast as well: the stern but increasingly unhinged commander of the rescue ship, his quietly professional but compassionate second-in-command, and the guy always grumbling on the job. As for the main character, Tom Baker is in his heyday here as the Doctor, juggling humor and seriousness perfectly and sucker-punching a man without giving the impression of violence, and his rapport with Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane is also at its peak--the wittily barbed yet friendly banter between them throughout the story is priceless. Finally, special effects are never a deciding factor in ""Doctor Who"" but the semi-invisible antimatter creatures and the make-up for the mutated version of Sorenson are cleverly rendered through good old fashioned professional craftsmanship without the benefit of CGI and hold up remarkably well still; as for the spaceship model, well, okay, you can tell they tried.

This is not a pivotal tale. Nobody regenerates, no companion joins or departs, there are no Dalek invasions nor revelations of Gallifrey. But in a way that's all for the better. Instead, ""Planet of Evil"" is a stellar example of just how enjoyable and entertaining ""Doctor Who"" can typically and reliably be on a regular basis.",1204848000,4,3756,5.104065040650407
775355,5,6304052871,"Dr. Who was in its golden age when PLANET OF EVIL was broadcast in the mid-70s.  Tom Baker had assumed his iconic role as the good Doctor and, now in his second season, he was really on form.  PLANET OF EVIL was one of those great Dr. Who stories which was haunting, scary, well acted, well written, well produced and well realized.  It was in short the classic hide behind the sofa story.

The Doctor and Sarah have materialized on Zeta Minor at the edge of the known universe.  They arrive to find the skeletal remains of a human; all the life having been sucked out of him.  Of course, the Doctor and Sarah are blamed.  As it turns out, Zeta Minor is something of a gateway between the universes of matter and anti-matter.  The creature responsible for sucking the lives out of people is something of a hybrid creature which lives in an abyss between the two universes and who is attacking people it seems because a researcher is intent on removing hybrid crystals from the planet for use as fuel in the human colonies.  The Doctor returns the crystals, makes the creature happy and all is well again.

This episode is fantastic for anyone, hard core fan and casual observer alike.  The BBC effects department did a fantastic job on the jungle for this story (it was done entirely in studio!).

This story has very obvious elements from the film Forbidden Planet and the tale of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
The studio jungle location created for this story is impressively elaborate, very convincing. Cinematic in quality but done on a television scale.
It's very beautiful but I find the extensive use of red and pink colors a little distracting.
Cast includes Prentis Hancock (Paul Morrow) of SPACE:1999, series 1.

There are two documentaries included, A Darker Side and  Planetary Performance which chronicle the sincere resourcefulness and professionalism of this Doctor Who era.

The only Easter Egg is titled Hidden Hinchcliffe, an informal musing from the producer.

This review is for the PAL format Region 2 release of this story and as usual, for me anyway, the live video studio work looks like film which actually harmonizes the overall quality. I find it much less annoying than vacillating between the contrasting film and video segments, the entire production is much more even.

Truly a great adventure and another great PAL video format bargain!
Well worth the purchase of an all region player.
