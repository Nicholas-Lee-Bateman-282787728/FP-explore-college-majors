7890063,5,6305481407,This film is hands down one of my top 5 all time favorite. Its a Thriller/Horror that certainly delivers and holds up every time! There is not much else to say really. This is a MUST for any horror fan out there. Get it!,1370044800,,220,4.0227272727272725
7890064,5,6305481407,"This movie is a thrill ride that I never want to get off! It's like Natural Born Killers meets TheTexas Chainsaw Massacre. Please release it on DVD. I kept my VCR to play it. If you love this one also check out one of the director's other flicks "" The Convent.""  It is hard to find on DVD, but it was released in that format because I have it.
Break out your VCR, find a horror nut friend like me who still has one for gem's like this and give this a watch. Get some popcorn and rock out to the beginning  ""In-Gada-Da-Vida"" massacre. If you don't love this movie and make it your lives mission to find it on dvd, there's something seriously wrong with you.",1325808000,,656,4.15748031496063
7890065,5,6305481407,"The first time I saw this movie was years ago when I worked in a Hollywood Video Store. I could remember how the cover of the movie was, the whole story and plot (if you could even say it had a plot, lol) everything, but for the life of me I could NOT remember the name. I could remember EXACTLY where the movie was on our ""wall"" in our store too. I just spent almost 2 hours going through all the movies that came out during my time working there trying to find this movie in the list, or other movies that were on the wall around it trying to atleast jog my memory. Well, it worked and I found it!!!! ""YAY!!!"" right? Nope cause it's on VHS and we don't own one of those, they are obsolete, lol. I really need to find a digital copy or a copy on disc. I wouldn't even care if it was just bootleg, lol. I really thought this movie was funny so many years ago when I saw it and I think my husband would enjoy it, please if someone can help me obtain a copy of this that isn't on VHS, please help!!!! Still a MUST SEE movie though, it's sickly hilarious.",1294358400,,1052,3.990521327014218
7890066,4,6305481407,"I WISH THIS WAS ON DVD,THIS WAS CRAZY ASS MOVIE.LIKE IT ALOT 4/5. COULD BE A CLASSIC",1259539200,,84,4.0
7890067,5,6305481407,"Thisis easliy the best movie I've seen in years. I randomly picked this one up at a video store, and I watched it back to back.
The story is a little like this. Two brothers called The James Boyz escapes Death Row, and takes refuse in a small little town called ""Beatty"". There's Odessa Lee James, who act's as the more dominant of the pair. Odessa is slick, and smoth. Then there's Kyle John James. This one is a little more hyper, and is just as ruthless.
The police are out everywhere looking for these two, and are just a step or two behind them. The kicker is, when these two ruthless killers need a place to hide out, they crash at the quint-essential ""Cleaver"" family household. The father is in the same metallity as Wally Kleaver. In one of the funnier dioluges, Odessa and Kyle are useing ""foul"" langue while talking to the mother of the family, and the father enterups him and say's ""You can take your langue somewhere else mister!""
But that's as far as I go. You MUST see the rest for yourself.
The SECOND this movie comes out on DVD, I'm there.
To give you an idea, of just how great this flick is..imagine if Quentin Tarintino and Peter Jackson teamed up to do a movie togther. If they ever did, this would be it!
Bottom line is, if you love cult movies, and love Tarintino and Peter Jackson's movies, take a risk and get this one! You will be glad you gave it a chance.",1000080000,2,1384,4.306513409961686
7890068,4,6305481407,"I bought this movie from a local video store thinking,maybe it would be alright,it turned out to be a nasty little gem. It turns out that the movie is about two maniacs against a whole lot of maniacs,to say more would spoil the surprise.",992044800,,237,4.409090909090909
7890069,5,6305481407,"This movie is about 2 all-American teens who kill their parents in cold blood...then smile. Two years later, they escape from prison, where they are awaiting the electric chair, and take a ""normal"" suburban family hostage. When I first saw it, I thought that it couldn't get any more twisted after the beginning, the the ending totally messed with my mind. It scares me that people out there can actually think stuff... up like this. Highly recommended to fans of B horror movies.",991785600,,480,4.795180722891566
