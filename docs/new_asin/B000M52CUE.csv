8514613,5,B000M52CUE,"This concert is from Birmingham 1983.  It is an incredible example of Nusrat's looser early style.  The run time on Amazon, as well as the back of the DVD case says 2:49, it's actually closer to 3:49.  I would not recommend this to those who are unfamiliar with Nusrat, but if you are a fan I would recommend this highly.  For me, this music is much more fulfilling than his later Real World recordings.  The quality of the audio and video production is fair, there are a few minor skips in the footage and the tablas are low in the mix.  There is an hour long, amazing version of Yeh Jo Halka Halka just before the title track.  The song selection and performance are outstanding.  Tracklist is as follows:

1. Araj Sun Leejo More
2. Yaad-E-Nabi Ka Gulshan
3. Unke Dar Par Pahunchane To
4. Menoon Yaar Manaunoon Di
5. Sanson Ki Mala Pe
6. Yeh Jo Halka Halka
7. Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal

Also, the ""free bonus cd"" is an awful dance DJ mix which does not contain any of Nusrat's music.",1213056000,,985,4.275675675675676
