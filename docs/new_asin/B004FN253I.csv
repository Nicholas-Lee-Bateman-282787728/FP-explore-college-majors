4370601,2,B004FN253I,"...but instead, it was just kind of 'meh'.  I understand that it had to be made to fit into the time constraints of a tv show, as it was originally aired, but it was less about the trail and the people who attempt to hike it as it was a bunch of environmental preaching.  Seriously, the documentary was less than an hour long, and the people who would buy it are interested in the actual, you know, Appalachian Trail, not the brook trout in the Smokies, acid rain, DDT, ticks, falcons on their way back from extinction, etc etc etc.  Seriously--enough of the environmental claptrap. And I'm guessing miniscule variations in the ph levels of the mountain streams harm and stress the fish a whole lot less than a gaggle of so-called scientists tramping through the water on a regular basis, cornering the fish, and then shocking them with 40 volts of electricity.  But then again, I'm not an expert--I could be wrong.

On the plus side, the scenery and cinematography was awesome--definitely what you'd expect from Nat Geo.  Otherwise, it was frustrating to watch.",1311120000,13,1062,4.713513513513513
4370602,4,B004FN253I,I really liked it where they showed the end of the trail.,1417737600,,57,3.8333333333333335
4370603,3,B004FN253I,This dvd was a doco but not as informative as I thought it would be. Viewing time too short but still worth a watch.,1402444800,,116,3.875
4370604,5,B004FN253I,I loved this book and the stories of his friends he met on the trail. The support of the locals is interesting and the trust the hikers have in them. This is the real American way of life everyone should experience. This will bring the trail right into your home and you don't have to suffer the sore feet or bad weather. This is a good arm chair book to read anytime.,1387238400,,368,4.125
4370605,3,B004FN253I,A three rating because it doesn't work on most dvd players. I've tried playing it on several..I gave this  video as a gift and the person  does not have the right dvd player to show the movie.  I was not able to return it.  The film itself was excellent and inspirational. Well done.,1383782400,,283,4.283018867924528
4370606,4,B004FN253I,"The Appalachian Trail runs 2, 175 miles from Georgia to Maine, covering 14 states. Every year 2,000 people start the thru hike, 1:4 finish. It is a tough, brutal hike, and those who finish should be congratulated.

In 1921 Brendan McKie proposed the Appalachian Trail. This trail is maintained by 6,000 volunteers from Hiking Clubs. It is known as the longest conservation project in the World.

The trail has four parts, The Southern States, The Virginia Highlands, The Mid-Atlantic Lowlands, and The New England States. Springer Mt in Georgia is the usual starting place, which leads to the highest peak on the trail, Kleeman's Dome, you have crossed from Georgia, to North Carolina, to the border of Tennessee. Onto the Virginia Highlands, 550 miles of smooth terrain and some ofthe oldest mountains in the world. The halfway point of the Appalachian trail is Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Then to the Mid-Atlantic Lowlands with rocky outcrops. The most remote and dramatic of the hike is New England, hikers say it is the best and the toughest. Here you have 80%of the trail done, but have only consumed 20% of the effort. Onto Baxter Peak, the finish line in Maine. Mt Katahdin, 5, 662 feet of mountain. The climate can become so extreme that the park is closed by October 15.

This film by National Geographic is glorious. The mountains, the environment, the trail are seen in all it's glory. The people we meet are what make the trail so exciting, the volunteers who man and maintain the trails, the good people who do good deeds everyday. I thought this film gave us a glimpse into the trail. I live along the trail, and see the hikers come through my town. We offer food, a place to sleep and wash clothes, we are known as one of the friendliest towns along the way. I see hikers waiting outside the post office to pick up their packages filled with goodies and re supplies. A glorious day for them. What an American way of living. Most terrific!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-23-13",1382486400,3,1993,4.734870317002882
4370607,4,B004FN253I,"This was the only time my interest in a thru-hike held the attention of my entire family. Clearly they found the video interesting enough to get some idea of what I've been yammering about all this past year. I even sensed a willingness to try the trail themselves, if only for a day hike.",1372896000,,289,4.37037037037037
4370608,5,B004FN253I,Fantastic Dvd I'm very glad I own it. As a hiker myself and a former society and consevanct member I'd highly recommend it.,1366588800,,123,4.391304347826087
4370609,2,B004FN253I,"This could have been so much better. To begin with, the DVD goes off on environment tangents about brook trout, falcons, and other animals in danger of extinction. OK, that's great and all but I wanted to see the trail and what hikers go through day to day. Secondly, it completely blows over the Delaware River crossing, which is 80% of why I wanted to see it since I live in the area. Lastly, the music is just not fitting - sad, weeping violins and boring mandolin/back country songs play during otherwise positive moments - it really ruins the mood.",1359244800,,553,4.54
4370610,3,B004FN253I,"The Appalachian Trail DVD is a bit disappointing. I expected more, even for a short program made for TV. The person who directed the film must have seen the AT as only a foot path through the woods. They really missed the essence of the AT hiking experience and the trail community. They should have talked with some thru-hikers first. There is some good photography though. The DVD that National Geographic did about the Pacific Crest Trail is better. If you want to see a DVD that really shows life on the AT, both the joys and the hardships, check out Appalachian Impressions by Mark Flagler.",1341014400,10,595,4.622641509433962

And it is hard not to get excited too! Movie arrived promptly, in great shape, packed well. Thank you!",1469664000,,247,4.276595744680851
8428094,2,B004FN253I,"This movie was very marginal at showing you the Appalachian Trail. Rather, the National Geographic editors chose to spend  to  of the time taking about environmental issues. I appreciate environmental issues, but I purchased this movie to learn specifics about the Appalachian Trail and not about highly focused aspects of the ecology of the trail. One is not left with any feel whatsoever about what hiking the Appalachian Trail is all about.",1454544000,3,443,5.138888888888889
