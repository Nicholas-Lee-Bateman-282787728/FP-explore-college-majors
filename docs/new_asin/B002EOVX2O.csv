3918360,2,B002EOVX2O,"Was hoping his would be a sleeper as the ad campaign has been in full swing with poster placements, distributor plugs and so on. Unfortunately, from beginning to end things keep ticking away at making this a recommendation and/or a re-watchable film.

The story follows a best selling author as he is mysteriously lied to from everyone that surrounds him (fiancee, lawyer, new girlfriend, etc.) then unwittingly gets swept into the criminal world to fix these ""lies and illusions"". Christian Slater plays the writer, Cuba Gooding plays the bad guy boss, and the two fighting gals are played by B movie queens Christa Campbell and Sarah Ann Schultz.

Truly, everything about this film as it transpires makes you want to turn it off, from the corny writing (if Slater said that stupid line of ""I am just a writer"" one more time above the 10 others I would have had to call it quits), cheesy situations, jittery camera work that blurs each action scene (the effect of hiding not really doing the stunts and low speed contact), bad editing (the voices blatantly mismatch the mouth(s) in well over 30 different scenes), but mostly the horrible fight choreography. The movie was being sold in the ads as having the cool fight sequence between the two ladies, but their bar kick fight scene was so poorly done, it felt hollow. Screening the film in store actually lost rentals as customers were immediately turned off by the bad camera work and cheesy fighting. The camera jitter was so bad in one of the lawyer office scenes it actually felt like the camera was bumped and dropped.

The Blu quality was not given any treatment and the resulting low grade feel gave it a reference right to a B film (non Blu preservation). This kind of work has unfortunately plummeted Cuba's sale and rental status with those last few films; this did not help. The supplement is an 11 minute making-of that contained more footage from the movie than it did relevant interview/background material. Can only recommend as a rental when you are in the mood for what has come to be expected from this crew. Hope you get something more out of it.",1254009600,2,2117,4.716216216216216

My popcorn was still warm and I expected that mysterious motivations and plot-twists were just around the corner. Unfortunately, disillusionment began to creep in before my popcorn cooled. The evil mobster's(Cuba Gooding) terrifying henchman turned out to be an elderly fellow with a poorly-dyed, ridiculous combover.  Gooding's bad guy had all the malevolent ferocity of a sleepy Sunday School teacher. The kidnap scene which kicked off the plot was poorly choreographed, acted and shot.

3918379,1,B002EOVX2O,"Wow, after seeing Sacrifice - another recent straight-to-DVD thriller starring Cuba Gooding and Christian Slater, I was VERY impressed.  It's one of the best movies I've seen either one of them in.  Almost all of Cuba's recent efforts have been awesome, way better than his ""show me the money""/what dreams may come career in the 90s as a black man that white suburban moms could appreciate. Blah. The NEW Cuba is almost always kickin a$$ and takin names.  Really, for grade A action movies check out ""Hero Wanted"", ""Sacrifice"", ""line watch"", ""shadowboxer"",  ""the hit list"", or even ""wrong turn at tahoe"". They are all unique, showing a new badazz side of Cuba that I really doubt anyone could have seen coming from his ""hey college kids, pass the chips and lemme have a seat at the dinner table!"" persona of the past - I used to really dislike the guy, but now I'm addicted to his recent efforts as I am to anything involving Charles Bronson, Van Damme, or Sylvester Stallone - can't wait to see his new collaboration with Dolph Lundgren, oh ya baby!  But back to this movie, it really blows.  Cuba isn't given an interesting or believable role, Christian Slater seems to be on perkosette the whole time(in a bad way, if I read that I might want to see this too but his acting is so bland in this ben stein might as well have had the lead role) and there's almost no action.  I kept waiting for something cool to happen but it just doesn't. Spoiler: Christian Slaters wife is alive the whole time, which comes as no surprise because you won't care about any of the characters!  I think Christian Slater always has the potential to be awesome, and recent Cuba is WAY cooler than anything Slater or he himself did in the past - but this movie is a real snoozin poozer.  Skip it and get ""sacrifice"" instead, you'll be impressed at how awesome Cuba and Slater can be in modern times - but this movie would lead anyone to think the exact opposite. PS ""Way of War"" with recent Cuba also stinks so avoid that one at all costs, other than those 2 I'd say from the late 2000's into the 2010's Cuba can almost do no wrong.  I haven't seen Redtails because I'm so disappointed in everything George Lucas has touched (or should I say slaughtered) after 1977 Star Wars.  We never needed to know what a wuss Anakin Skywalker was or pretend Gredo shot first.  Jar Jar Binks is on the level of Lies and Illusions - just stay away or your stomach will turn as your mind realizes you've wasted precious moments of your brief existence in the cosmos.  Life is too short for Lies and Illusions.",1351123200,,2574,4.4743589743589745
3918380,2,B002EOVX2O,"<strong>Lies and Illusions</strong> (Tibor Tak&aacute;cs, 2009)

After a quick check of the admittedly rather incomplete spreadsheet I keep of all the movies I've seen (anything I watched before June 2007, thanks to a hard drive crash, relies on my often-faulty memory or reviews I wrote after seeing the films in question), <em>Lies and Illusions</em> is, by far, the best Tibor Tak&aacute;cs-directed movie I have ever seen. (A quick check of IMDB reveals this may not be true; Tak&aacute;cs directed <em>The Gate</em>, which I remember seeing in the theatre back in 1986, but haven't seen it since, so can't remember enough to rate it.) It is worth noting, however, that everything is relative when it comes to such statements. The three other Tak&aacute;cs movies sitting on my list have either one star (<em>Rats</em>, the infamous <em>Mansquito</em>) or zero stars (<em>Earthquake: Nature Unleashed</em>). So I can call <em>Lies and Illusions</em> ""the best Tibor Tak&aacute;cs-directed movie I have ever seen"" and still, in the next paragraph, compare it to a steaming pile of horse feces, and have the pile come up looking the better of the two. Ain't life grand?

Plot: a hapless writer of self-help books, Wes Wilson (Christian Slater, in case you've been wondering what he's been up to since his brief A-list reign in the nineties), is engaged to a lovely lass named Sam (<em>Cleaner</em>'s Sarah Ann Schultz). Until, that is, he is jumped from behind after a party and knocked out. When he comes to, Sam has disappeared, kidnapped, and presumably killed, by arch-criminal Isaac Kahn (Cuba Gooding, Jr., in case you've been wondering what HE's been up to since his brief A-list reign in the nineties). Sam's lawyer, Andrew (<em>Infection</em>'s Lochlyn Munro), informs Wes that she left him pretty much everything, and that if she's not found within a year, it all reverts to him. Fast-forward a year, Wes is slowly starting to move on with his life, including having started to fall for Nicole (<em>Drive Angry</em>'s Christa Campbell) a hot wrtier for a women's magazine who seduced him during an interview. There's one problem, however--it seems that Sam stole something from Isaac back in the day, and Isaac believes that something is in a safety deposit box in Spokane that Wes has just been given possession of, due to the terms of Sam's will...

I actually started out kind of liking the first half of this movie. Yes, I grant you, the script (by first-timer Eric James, who has no other credits at all on IMDB) is awful, but it at least <em>tries</em> to develop its characters, however badly it may fail, and it throws in a few not-so-plausible-but-still-pretty-cool plot twists. And then we get to Spokane, and it is there that the movie begins to resemble the aforementioned pile. At that point, it becomes ludicrous in the extreme, both in the almost nonexistent script and in the barely-held-together string of action sequences and awful CGI.

But still, there are movies like that that can be enjoyable, at least on a guilty pleasure level. (I am, unapologetically, a huge fan of <em>Alien vs. Predator</em>.) What really sent me to the garage to grab a sledgehammer with the intent of doing harm to the television, is that after all those annoying action sequences (but before the bad CGI), we actually have the <em>beginnings</em> of the story... and the end of the movie. It's all setup followed by five minutes of worthless payoff. To be fair, that there was any setup at all raises it above the level of Tak&aacute;cs' abovementioned pieces of Sci-Fi Channel Original Junk, and there's a reason both Slater and Gooding got so popular, however briefly, back in the day. They have not gotten any worse as actors, they're just getting crappy material. Also of note, for those who enjoy such things, there's an absolutely ridiculous catfight scene. **",1329264000,2,3877,5.015527950310559
3918391,1,B002EOVX2O,"Do not waste your time or money, one of the worst movies I've seen in years, Gooding and Slater used to be actors, what happened?",1320278400,,129,4.2
3918392,5,B002EOVX2O,"I just watched this movie on Saturday and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I recall seeing the preview for this flick a year or so ago and thought it might have some potential.  I then recall seeing some reviews panning the film by criticizing the acting, directing, writing and editing. After my viewing experience I agree with some of the poor acclaim, yet I find it to be the charm behind the movie.  Allow me to explain this duplicity.

""Lies & Illusions"" is about Wes Wilson (Christian Slater) a best selling ""self-help"" author.  Wes is whimsical type of guy and seems to be on cloud nine.  His book is doing great and he is recently engaged to a wonderful woman named Samantha (Sarah Ann Schultz).  Unfortunately Samantha is kidnapped, goes missing and is presumed dead.  Fast forward a year later and Wes is in a rut, he has writer's block and is still forlorn for Samantha.  Then he meets Nicole (Christa Campbell) and there seems to be love in the air.  However, Wes bumps into Isaac (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who might have had his hand in Samantha's foul play.  As fate would have it Samantha isn't dead, she was a thief who worked for Isaac. This now puts Wes in the center of...eh....well ""Lies & Illusions"".

Now on paper this movie premise sounds not half bad, not totally original, but not half bad.  As a matter of fact, I found the first forty minutes or so to be very good.  There was this pace of mystery and intrigue.  Conversely, after the character of Samantha ""returns"" the movie becomes an entirely different film altogether.

The movie turned from a thriller to an unintentional comedy in the manner of two minutes.  I am talking ""nifty little thriller"" straight down into ""campy road"".  This is where the acting, directing, writing and editing became a parody of a real movie.  I enjoy Christian Slater as an actor but I found that this movie made him almost a cartoon character.  It was like he was making up his dialogue as he went along. As for Cuba Gooding Jr., I also think he is a fine actor with wonderful range.  His performance was not bad, but ranged from malicious to androgynous.  As for the rest of the cast, I have never seen them in anything else so eh.....

These are some insane and absurd factors that made this motion picture its own unique monster.

* The opening credits utilize animation that resembles a Pink Panther cartoon.

* Christian Slater providing painfully obvious statements the entire movie, for instance he gets shot in the arm and says ""I just got shot in the arm"".  Or ""My ribs hurt"" after being hit in the ribs. How about when a person is shot and killed, Christian screams dubiously ""YOU KILLED HIM""! After a while this exercise becomes very hysterical, why, because it happens a lot.

* Cuba Gooding Jr. keeps talking about diamonds.  Believe me, it is funny.

* Despite tedious car chases, gun play and fist fights in public and various explosions there isn't one police car or rescue vehicle in sight.

* The two women in Christian Slater's life, Nicole and Samantha have a fist fight in a bar that could have been a deleted scene from a Power Rangers' movie.

* ""I love you"" happens before sex.

* Cuba Gooding Jr. likes coffee but not on his shoes.

* Fighting is cooler when you use furniture and other blunt objects.

* ""I'm just a writer"" is said so many times by Christian Slater it could be used as a hypnotism ruse.

*  Watch a FBI agent break every single rule in the book.

* Christian Slater screaming profanity out of a speeding car's window....to no one.

* A scene where Christian Slater wants Samantha to stop the car to save the person who provided ""cover"" for them.  Once they stop he says ""thanks for the cover"".  I don't know why but hearing ""cover"" that close together given this scenario had me running to the bathroom in laughter like a giddy school girl.

* A hit man with a hair cut that resembles a very bad toupee.

* Christian Slater in a pink bath robe.

* I think there were a couple of scenes where Cuba was wearing women's makeup.

* Most fist fights end up with Christian Slater being a mop.

* A plane blows up in this movie and it looks like a video game.

* Will Jack Nicholson ever play Christian Slater's dad?  This has nothing to do with the movie but I figure this is a great time to ask this question.

Digressing, I said I really liked this movie and I did.  For me fondness for a movie has nothing to do with the movie being good or bad.  This movie has many faults, but it was entertaining as hell. I wasn't bored, I was able to laugh and there was action.  This movie is a cheesy ride and I can see how it might throw some people off.  It almost did for me since the first half of the movie was totally divorced from the second half.

In closing, I must note that I watched this movie with my fianc&eacute;e and she found the same humor with this film that I did. I feel we were both in the right frame of mind to laugh when we watched this movie (it had been a long day) so that might be why we embraced it. ""Lies & Illusions"" is not a good movie; it had some potential and fell hard on its face. However taken at face value, we both thought it was a great way to pass ninety minutes and I am proud to have this in my collection.  This film has a sense of charm and will be watched again when I need a smile to cross my face.",1319414400,4,5325,4.336032388663968
3918393,1,B002EOVX2O,"Lies and Illusions was released on DVD on September 29, 2009, and was directed by Tibor Takacs. The movie stars Christian Slater as Wes Wilson, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Isaac, Sara Ann Schultz as Samantha and Christina Campbell as Nicole.
Wes Wilson is a first-time novelist who's book, 'How To Find Love In The 21st Century', is topping all the best seller lists. Wes is also engaged to be married to the girl of his dreams. Everything seems perfect in Wes' life until his fiance' is kidnapped and presumed dead. Soon Wes meets Isaac, played by Gooding Jr., who claims that Wes' fiance', Samantha stole 10 million dollars worth of diamonds from him and guess what? He wants them back! Now Wes is faced with the harsh reality that everything Samatha had ever told him was a lie.
Let me just stop right here so you won't get the impression that this is actually a good movie. It was almost painful for me to watch Lies And Illusions because I am such a huge fan of Slater and Gooding. The acting is below B-flick and the camera angles are reminiscent of home movies shot by a shaky mom. Toss in the ultra-cheesy special affects and what's left over is Lies And Illusions. If you find yourself at the video store standing in front of this movie, please walk away quickly! If you will not heed my advice, you would be better off by simply walking in the store, handing the kid behind the counter $3 and walking out empty handed. I am only giving Lies And Illusions a 1-star rating. Half a star for Christian Slater and half for Cuba Gooding Jr. And trust me when I tell you...I am being generous!

By the end, I was sad for Slater and the turn his career has taken that he has to accept roles like this. The premise was interesting, but the actresses are not very solid. I agree too, that the jerky camera work was to hide the fact that they were not really doing the moves in the fight scenes--like the audience would not notice. Wes is annoying, but I thought he was supposed to be sort of a nerd. The opening scene with his bizarre marriage proposal was laughable. It starts off decent, but gets worse as it progresses. I am not going to tell people whether or not they should watch this as I can't speak for what they may or may not like. But at the end of the day, it is not a very good film. Sometimes I wonder if the actors realize how bad a film is or how they feel when they see a bad film in which they appear. Slater and Gooding, Jr. are not stupid and I am sure they realized how bad this was once they saw it.

3918400,5,B002EOVX2O,"Simply a phenomenal film.  Let me break it down for you:

1: The Plot -
Simply put, our hero (Slater) has just enjoyed some success with a recent book (we hear some excerpts throughout, it's complete dreck), only to have his love snatched away from him by mysterious dudes wearing Nixon masks and Cuba Gooding Jr.  A year later, after everybody things she's dead, she reappears just as the Nixons & Jr. resurface.  Slater has a new gf who is weird looking and stuff.  They all try to make him get some diamonds out of a safety deposit box, and the new gf wants a list of some kind as well.  Shooting, a plane crash, and general mediocrity ensue.

2: The Acting -
Slater and Gooding Jr... both solid right? They must have been drunk or something for this one.  Horrendous acting.  They were both outshone by the random bearded fellow in a bar who exclaims ""ma beer!"" as it is snatched away in a bar fight.  I'm not sure if we have the script, direction, or possibly food poisoning on the set to account for this.

3: The Script -
Wow.  I'm sure somebody was flogged mercilessly for producing this.  There were MANY times when it must simply have read: ""Slater runs awkwardly with brief case wearing leather jacket, and whining in a loud, sarcastic manner.  Continue for 30 minutes."" Dialog was abominable.  It was stupid.

4: The Directing -
In short, whoever said, ""alright great, I think we got it on that take!"" during the filming of this should be banned from the industry.

5: The Score -
Usually this isn't something I pick up on too much, but in this case it was very noteworthy.  The tantalizing, suspense-filled notes toyed with my emotions throughout the film.  The score was artistically woven throughout the scenes to generate a very powerful effect.  Oh wait, no it was complete garbage.  Some jack*** probably whipped this up on a cheap keyboard in his bedroom.

6: Highlights -
a) Slater is locked in a trunk and is being driven somewhere.  He is whining incessantly (as he does throughout the entire film) and the camera keeps cutting to the driver exclaiming ""SHUT THE F*** UP!!!"".  I don't know if this was in the script, or perhaps an outtake not intended to be on camera.  I could have used about 80 more times throughout the movie of somebody just telling Slater the same.
b) Slater's new gf screaming ""I'll cover you, go!"" and then firing approximately 400 rounds from a handgun at nothing in particular.
c) Gooding Jr. getting his book signed early on.  The direction here must have been ""Act like a drag queen, wear makeup and a fake mustache, and make the audience uncomfortable through sheer awkwardness."" Well executed sir.
d) Slater gets shot towards the end.  Sadly, the wound was not fatal, but it does shut him up mid-rant and was a welcomed break from his constant yelling.
e) Car chases, bravo.  If you close your eyes during the car chase at the end you will hear four things, and four things only.  First, screeching tires, a staple for any car chase. Second, gun shots.  Lots of them. Also pretty standard. Third, you will hear slater whining.  Loudly.  Sarcastically.  Constantly.  He'll yell things like ""WELL I'M SORRY IT'S JUST A BIT SHOCKING TO FIND YOU ALIVE AFTER A YEAR"" and ""WHOOO HOO BWAHAHAH AHHH OH MY GOD, WHAAAAT? YEEE HAW"" repeatedly.  Sigh.  Fourth, you'll hear the two women in the car telling him to shut up.  Thanks ladies.
f) Slater runs funny.  He hunches over and swings his arms wildly.  Also, when being pursued, he'll invariably leave a safe crowded area and find a secluded dark alley, park, or possibly slaughter house where the bad guys are sure to find him.
g) Complete lack of police anywhere.  His new gf is supposed to be FBI and even she can't get a freakin' squad car to the meeting point where the bad guys just punch Slater a bunch and then threaten him.  One cop gets shot early on, maybe that scared the rest of them off.  I dunno.
h) The plane crash exemplified special effects at their lamest.  Good lord.

FINAL CONCLUSION:
When I watched this film I had tears pouring out of my eyes I was laughing so hard.  It took a while for me to catch on that it was absolute rubbish, but once I accepted that it was HILARIOUS.  I highly recommend this to anybody.  Best viewed while intoxicated, and possibly playing a drinking game where you have to drink every time Slater yells.",1273104000,6,4347,4.549677419354839

3918414,1,B002EOVX2O,"I tried my best to watch this movie to it's bitter end, but had to give up. Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding Jr. would have done adequate jobs if they were directed properly. An interesting plot with talented (at least one) actors undone by bad acting, a poor screenplay and production. If you must see this movie for educational purposes -- rent, don't buy. You have been warned.",1267660800,,381,4.617647058823529
3918415,1,B002EOVX2O,"On paper, this movie has an interesting premise.  An award-winning author of a relationship book (Slater) has his fiance abducted on the night of his book's big promotional party, and after a year passes with no trace of his beloved it becomes clear that she was hiding a lot of important secrets, not the least of which being a small alcove in their garage which is filled with weapons and high-tech gadgetry.  Suddenly Slater's writer finds himself hunted down by gangsters and diamond thieves, led by an unflappable and horribly overacted Cuba Gooding.

Others have said it before, and I'll add to their claims: not even in a schmaltzy ironic way is this movie worth watching.  Everything about it is disasterous.  Slater's amazing author has one of the worst written acceptance speeches I've ever heard.  The vicious gangsters make incomprehensible decisions.  The gun fights are so poorly framed, directed, and edited they seem like jokes.  The fight scenes are filmed chaotically, so that the actors and actresses don't have to do any fancy footwork, but this means they also make little to no sense.  In one fight scene, inexplicably, the combatants decide to jump up on tables and engage each other from off the floor.

The acting, the plotting, and the special effects aren't even amateurish, because that makes it sound like someone, somewhere was actually trying when they made this film.  Not so.  Every single person involved in this mess of a movie seems to have done a half-assed job, and the only resulting illusion is the very idea that this thing is even remotely watchable.",1266278400,6,1592,4.921348314606742
3918416,1,B002EOVX2O,"My boyfriend and I rented this last night, never having heard of it before but so curious to see Gooding and Slater in action together.  All I can say is - ""SIGH"" and ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING""...........

Bad movie overall with dubious plot and poor acting (and you have to realize, I've always been a big fan of Gooding and Slater).  And that bit with the ""recipes for troubled couples"" was just so ridiculous and unnecessary.  Was it all meant to be funny?  Seriously, did I miss the joke and timing of the movie altogether?

Sadly, a good couple of hours of my life I'll never get back again.",1266105600,5,595,4.412844036697248

3918418,1,B002EOVX2O,"I was in the video store and saw a cool looking action suspense film in the new release section called ""Lies and Illusions"" starring Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding Jr.  OK, OK, I realized it was some straight to video B flick because I'd never heard of it, but I figured, ""hey, good cast!  How bad can it be?""  Boy, how the mighty have fallen.  The first third feels like a watchable low budget indie flick and isn't too bad.  Then they must have run out of money.  At this point the shot-on-location story inexplicably moves from Seattle to Spokane of all places and the actors stop even trying.  My wife and I were in tears laughing by this time.  The unchoriographed fight scenes between out-of-shape actors with no martial arts training looked like middle aged Power Rangers on Methadone.  As it gets progressively worse toward the end, better quality diologue could be found in a porn movie. Then to top it off, there's a plane crash at the end that looks straight out of an Ed Wood movie.  If you see this on the shelf, be a good samaritan and remove all copies and hide them so nobody else gets subjected to this.",1265500800,23,1123,4.46078431372549
3918419,3,B002EOVX2O,"Wes Wilson (Christian Slater) is a best selling author.  His first book, which is a self-help book about honesty, becomes a best seller.  It was bought by million and saved many of relationships.  Wes Wilson is celebrating his fame as a writer in the first scenes, and is deeply in love with his beautiful blond fiance (Sarah Ann Schultz).  Suddenly, after they leave the party, his fiance is abducted and declared dead, Wes suddenly finds himself hunted by hired killers, beautiful spies and a ruthless criminal mastermind (Cuba Gooding, JR.).  The plot then becomes somewhat of a hysterical comedy instead of the suspense thriller that it touts it is.

Poor Christian Slater is giggly during most of the last half of the movie as he cluelessly runs into implausible plot twists.  They keep coming one after another, as he can only laugh and scream through the crazy script.

The ""hook"" of the plot is what does he have that an international smuggling ring want?  Why did his late fiance keep a secret room with fake passports and enough weapons to invade a small country?  Who can he trust?  Why is he finding out about her double life after no news for a year?

Overall it is wacky watchable, but the twists and turns become semi-slapstick comedy instead of the thriller you wanted.",1264982400,,1285,4.738738738738738

To be sure, there has never, ever, in the history of film, been such an unbearably awful waste of celluloid as this.  By comparison, having your fingernails and toenails ripped out, one by one, over a concurrent hour and a half by a pair of rusty pliers, would without a doubt, be complete and utter ecstasy compared to enduring the entirety of this bomb.  The entire cast and crew, if they have not already been, should be taken out back and shot, not once, but as many times as it takes to be absolutely and positively sure of their never being associated with any aspect of the film industry ever again.  I cannot even imagine what disturbing combination of abusive substances they were all on, when considering the making of, or appearing in, anything even remotely resembling this sad and blatant misuse of time and energy.  It is truly the worst nightmare you can imagine - times infinity.  Now, that being said - and it just HAD to be said - believe it or not, I actually sincerely urge you to somehow garner every ounce of your strength, so as to make your most valiant attempt to withstand the overt and continuous barrage of mental garbage that is going to be thrown your way, if for no other reason than to conclusively have the absolute nadir from which to compare any other film.

Never mind the clumsy, cheesy dialoge, Slater and Schultz never for a moment seem to actually care for each other. Gooding's portrayal of an ambiguously gay crime boss is marginally better, if only for the novelty, but the role itself is a ridiculous caricature, and adds nothing to the story.  The chase scene is nothing but a chain of uninspired fender benders. The music is jarringly incongruous in every scene other than the bank-I'm assuming banks still play Muzak. Hollywood's long love affair with miraculous Hannukah guns that blaze for 8 days without reloading continues here, though the gunplay IS notable in that except in the closest quarters, everyone is a TERRIBLE shot.  After the first 30M, I only continued watching in a perverse curiosity to see if it got worse.  It did. I would sooner watch daytime TV than ever see this again.

I had to take the movie out when I heard ""I'm just a writer!"" for the umpteenth time!! If this is the best you can do, Cuba and Christian, you either need new agents or new careers.
