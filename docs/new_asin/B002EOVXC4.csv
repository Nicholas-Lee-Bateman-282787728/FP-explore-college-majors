8367909,3,B002EOVXC4,"White Night Wedding is an Icelandic film with English subtitles.  It's set mostly on a small island with a population of ten people or something like that.  An ex university lecturer who moved relocated to the island with his wife to help her cope with mental health issues but is now deceased, is now marrying pretty much one of two single girls on the island, who just happened to be one his former students.  However the wedding isn't running as smoothly as the couple would anticipate.  The first hurdle is the groom answers his phone during the vows, much to the priest's disgust.  Luckily it's just a rehearsal. Why you need to rehearse is beyond me, but people do it.  Other initial hurdles include his parents not being able to find the island, the best man/piano player being an overweight party type guy who has arrived on the island with no other clothes other than the suit he will be wearing at the wedding, as why would he need other clothes, and a mother in law who doesn't want her daughter marrying someone her age (she also doesn't like her other daughter seeing the only other single guy on the island).

The movie is told through a number of flashbacks, return to the modern day scenes.  Since the the potential and original wife are played by two characters that look similar including a lot of freckles over their face, (albeit one is a lot older) it was initially a bit confusing as you go, oh that's not just a younger version of that character, that's a completely different character.  It would have been better if they looked a bit different but then again you are attracted to a certain look I guess.  It did seem a bit ridiculous that the mother was so against the daughter marrying when there are no other alternatives on the island.  If the daughter met someone else (also in the case of her other daughter) she'd have to move away.  Any kids (grand kids for her) she's going to barely see with someone else.  Also I can't see how anyone would think a golf course where you have to row out in the ocean to an island for the first hole in a boat that leaks would ever attract players.

It's a dark comedy at times, road kill being used as a surprise meal for example, but really it's more of a light hearted drama about small eccentric town characters than anything else.  The father stepping up to save his daughter's special moment when the piano isn't playing was nicely done and there are moments like that occasionally.  It'll pass the time, but not something you'll remember months, let alone years down the track.",1480896000,,2550,4.522875816993464
8367910,4,B002EOVXC4,"Humorous and interesting. Stocked with funny characters, it deals with the inner turmoil of a college professor undergoing a mid-life crisis on the eve of his second wedding to a much younger woman.
Set on a small island on Iceland's northern coast, it successfully reflects small town attitudes the world over.
The only flaws were in the wedding itself ( it looked as though whoever wrote the screenplay didn't know how to pull it off ) and the use of frequent flashbacks that will confuse viewers as to where they are in the timeline of the film.
Still, it is well worth seeing!",1420329600,,580,4.640776699029126
8367911,3,B002EOVXC4,"I had high expectations for this movie given that it was recommended to me by two other people I respect. But, I was bored by it. Funny, dramatic, in a weird mixture, but it just didn't arouse much interests or excitement for me.",1389830400,,229,4.348837209302325
8367912,4,B002EOVXC4,"White Night Wedding isn't a comedy; it is a love triangle drama, where some situations are presented as funny, although, maybe, you have to be from Iceland to find them so. However, this is a good movie if you aware that what you are about to watch is a drama film.

Jon is torn between his dying love for his deranged wife, Anna, and his younger, former student, Thora. For the sake of his wife's mental health, they move back from Reykjavk to Flatey Island, where a community of peculiar people live and make life for Jon interesting for us to watch yet irritating for Jon to live.

Both the photography and the acting in this film are top-notch. However, the soundtrack is a bit off-putting. For some reason, a repeating blues instrumental track plays in the background whenever the ""funny"" situations are presented, which, for me, was distracting from the main love triangle plot.",1351987200,2,884,4.696774193548387
8367913,1,B002EOVXC4,"Why one star?  Because the cover makes it look like it's a comedy.  And it isn't.  It's a fairly depressing tragedy, with a couple comic moments.

It's actually a fairly good film, but I don't think the people marketing it had actually watched it.",1344902400,4,247,4.545454545454546
8367914,5,B002EOVXC4,"This is the first movie from Iceland I watched, and was quite impressed. Highly recommended. Not extravagant but really interesting.",1333584000,3,132,5.65
8367915,4,B002EOVXC4,"A real departure from this director's last effort (""Jar City"" - 5*) and almost as good.  Who'd a thunk Iceland could produce such good films?",1271462400,3,141,4.64
