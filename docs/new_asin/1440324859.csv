7795599,5,1440324859,"The picture on the cover is just beautiful and so I got the DVD and then also her book called ""Daring Color"".  My favorite part is what she does with shadows.  She has a couple of unusual techniques that I found really helpful.  For example she doesn't mix colors either on the palette or on the paper but rather paints multiple colors right next to each other on dry paper and lets them mix.  She says she never paints with just one color and it shows.  I have to admit I am not crazy about some of her still lifes but her shadow work is exquisite.  In both the book and the DVD she gives detailed instructions and it is like taking a class.  I highly recommend her.",1405036800,4,667,4.1640625

7795601,5,1440324859,I have had the pleasure to take a class with Anne and this is a wonderful tool to learn her techniques.  There was a glitch in getting the CD but the vendor handled the problem in a courteous and professional manner.  Very happy with the product and would recommend the vendor.,1396742400,2,277,4.411764705882353
