The zombies and the bloody attacks were well done. Not too gory. As much as you see on The Walking Dead. Never a dull moment.",1448150400,,285,4.296296296296297

- Luv: ""But we only have ghosts and spirits in India. Where did zombies come from?""
- Hardik: ""Globalization! These foreigners have screwed us! First, they brought HIV. Now, zombies!""

With Go Goa Gone, Bollywood dips into the horror sub-genre of the zombie comedy... and, to my surprise, pulls it off. Be aware that there's an abundance of expletives, a show of lechery, and that joints are smoked. Adversely, for the salivating gorehound, there's a minimum of gore. Someone's conscience must've been pricked because the film is prefaced with a disclaimer in the shape of Saif Ali Khan's PSA concerning the hazards of smoking. This DVD, by the way, offers the option to view the film with either English or Arabic sub-titles.

Two d0pehead slackers, Hardik (Kunal Khemu) and Luv (Vir Das), tag along when their roommate Bunny (Anand Tiwari) ventures down to Goa for a business presentation. In Goa Luv runs into a Facebook friend named Luna (Puja Gupta) who invites him and his friends to an underground rave party being held by the Russian mafia at a secluded island. Maybe the three friends should've caught a clue when no one wanted to ferry them over to that island. They get there anyway.

If there's a new lesson to be learned from this movie, it's that you should never order anything from the Siberian border. That's where the experimental pills came from, that were being sold at the rave. Come to find out, these drugs are saddled with unexpected side effects, transforming the revelers into the shambling undead. Oh, hey, there's Hardik and company running for their lives.

You're wondering at the flavor of the film? There's a scene in which our guys decide to take on a trio of fast-approaching zombie chicks:

- Hardik (assigning targets): ""Okay, I'll take the hot one. Luv, you take the pissed-off one. Bunny, you go for the fat one.""
- Bunny: ""Why do I always get the fat one? I want the hot one.""

It's a, um, no-brainer that Go Goa Gone owes much of its sensibility to Shaun of the Dead. I was wary of watching this one, but from jump the comic bits won me over. The cast is energetic and is cool as the other side of the pillow when it comes to timing and delivery and inducing laugh-out-loud moments. Kunal Khemu as the incorrigible Hardik (who ends his desperate prayer with ""Jai hind""), Vir Das as the bewildered lover boy Luv, and Anand Tiwari as the buttoned-down Bunny play off each other really well. For her part, Puja Gupta not only brings the sexy, she provides her share of levity and does her best to ground the narrative. Saif Ali Khan, who co-produces the film, has a macho supporting role as the Russian wiseguy Boris, never mind that, at one point, Bunny looks at him sideways and asks, ""Are you really Russian? You look a little desi."" Saif's response is hilarious. There's more boisterous slapstick here than there is character development, but you knew what you were going into. Go Goa Gone runs an hour and 45 minutes long which, as applicable to horror cinema, is appropriate in its brevity but, for a Bollywood picture, is stunningly short. Then again, there isn't a sweeping romance or epic familial rifts or extended musical numbers to bog things down. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if two tracks ""Slowly Slowly"" and ""Khoon Choos Le"" - became party anthems at the club. So, in the annals of the zom-com, chalk up Go Goa Gone as a good one.",1391990400,,3436,4.671074380165289
8583757,3,B00CNDXU5E,"The actors and actresses are attractive.

The film looks colorful and beautiful.

The flow is choppy.

The jokes are mixed. Sometimes, they are funny. Sometimes, they are bland.

In short, it's worth watching once.

Note: This movie speaks Hindi with English subtitles.",1382486400,,269,5.309523809523809
8583758,5,B00CNDXU5E,"Goa Goa Gone chronicles the adventures of two losers who go off to a Russian Mafia Rave party on a mysterious island and...wish they hadn't.

It's pretty formulaic...hapless young men floundering around team up with beautiful female and tough-guy pseudo Russian. But the characters are likable, the script witty, and there's something genuinely hilarious (IMHO) in listening to Indians drop in and out of English (mostly to make snarky asides).",1381363200,2,444,5.3428571428571425
8583759,5,B00CNDXU5E,"Loved it, a little biased, but it was just out right funny. English or Hindi, doesnt matter it is a culrural bridge movie, Bolly meets ""Cheech and Chong"", ""Scary Movie,"" and ""Bridesmaids,"" raunchy and off beat and belly laugh good.",1378771200,,231,4.8
