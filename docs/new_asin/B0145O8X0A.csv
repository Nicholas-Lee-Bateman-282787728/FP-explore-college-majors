7383692,5,B0145O8X0A,"We saw this movie in a movie theater and it is fantastic!! Your entire family will love it as well! I plan to buy this for each one of my married children for their families! Do not think that this is the actual dvd of the movie. It is not, it is only for Pastors sermons and clips of the movie so don't be deceived in thinking that this is the actual DVD! I thankfully read carefully and read where I won't actually be receiving the DVD.",1447200000,33,438,4.045977011494253
7383693,5,B0145O8X0A,"My husband, 30 year old daughter and I went to the theater to see this movie. We all liked it a lot. My daughter really liked how it ended. I don't want to give it away so I suggest going to see the movie or buy it! I highly recommend it.",1446508800,12,238,3.6862745098039214

7383700,3,B0145O8X0A,I was expecting the movie and the study guide in the same kit.  I was very disappointed that this wasn't the case.  It's hard to understand the study guide without watching the movie and this omission was not explained in the description of the purchase.,1457049600,,254,4.622222222222222
7383701,4,B0145O8X0A,I had hoped that the Woodlawn Pastor kit contained the excellent movie Woodlawn.  As near as I could tell it did not so I returned it and bought the DVD Woodlawn which my family and I love.,1456790400,,189,4.108108108108108

7383709,1,B0145O8X0A,"Also see review by David Mooney.  I agree with David.  I intended to use the WOODLAWN DVD with our ministry.  When I received the DVD I was surprised to see that the movie was not included.  Only one of the two disc seemed to work.  I will return the DVD and request the actual WOODLAWN DVD.  The information available with this purchase did not indicate that the movie was not part of the purchase.

7383710,1,B0145O8X0A,"Very disappointed. I feel I was deceived. If the movie itself was not part of the package, it should have indicated so.",1452729600,4,119,4.454545454545454
7383711,1,B0145O8X0A,"This was a ripoff.  How much money did Amazon and the seller of this pastor's kit make off of putting this DVD out there as an advanced pre-order item long before the actual movie was put out for pre-order?  This was a gift for my children since my wife and I saw the movie in the theatre and loved it so much.  I raced to order it when I saw it was available for pre-order thinking that I was getting the actual movie!  I guess it is my bad since I did not even see that it was not the movie DVD.  I will not only not be buying the actual DVD movie from Amazon or anywhere else, I will just rent it out of a Red Box or Netflix for a much lower price which will limit the money these marketers will make any further off of me.  Better yet, I will do what my friends have done and pay for a Roku box and wait until it is available.  It is a shame to use such an excellent movie with such a positive moral and religious message to sucker folks.",1451952000,8,942,3.875

At any rate, I wish Christians would stop making money off of a previous success.  I am scratching my head thinking who in their right mind would buy this discussion piece.
