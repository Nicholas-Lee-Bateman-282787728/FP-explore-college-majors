8342275,5,B001TQROBC,"Lucky Star
Young teen, Mary, works the family farm with her abusive mother. When she falls in love with the neighbor, whos a crippled war vet, her mother refuses to let her see him again because she doesnt want Mary to waste her time on a cripple. Meanwhile, the local rogue stalks Mary. Janet Gaynor plays the teen role well, much as Mary Pickford did. This is a sweet, sad story and a well-crafted silent. Great directing and beautiful cinematography. The emotion and suspense will keep you focused on this film. The Gaynor/Farrell matchup is perfect, and this film is must see viewing.

Liliom
A poor working girl, Julie, rebuffs the interest of a gentlemanly carpenter and, instead, idolizes a womanizing, scamming carousel barker. Against everyones advice, she moves in with him and gets pregnant. Worst acting ever, a primitive script, and simple sets, but theres something fascinating about this film. The empathy one feels for Julie provides the overwhelming interest. (This film actually justifies spousal abuse.) Lots of moralizing at the end. I can see where most viewers would hate this film, but I watched it to the end and didn't regret it. There is usually some good even in a bad movie. Watch at your own risk.",1498435200,,1226,4.866028708133971
8342276,5,B001TQROBC,"Frank Borzage was one of the greatest filmmakers of all times, even if his output was not abundant. This is a recent realization on my part: I had only seen as a kid ""The Big Fisherman"". But after discovering the wonder of ""7th Heaven"", I bought this fine collection that contains a few of his best works, all featuring very handsome leading man Charles Farrell, paired with his frequent co-star Janet Gaynor (""Lucky Star"") and Rose Hobart (""Lilion""). But for me the best gift was the inclusion of the wonderful drama ""The River"", which is not even mentioned in the product description. I do not believe that ""Lucky Star"" needs any more praise, because its moving love story among poor people has been very well evaluated; while ""Lilion"" is an adaptation of Ferenc Molnr's well-known play telling the story of the dead man who has a chance to return to Earth, later remade by Fritz Lang, and turned into the musical ""Carousel"" by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But ""The River"" deserves a rediscovery. A partially lost film, it was reconstructed by the Cinmathque Suisse from a copy found in the 20th Century-Fox vaults, using material from European film archives and the Library of U.S. Congress. Some people say it is the most erotic film of all times. I don't know if this is true, but it is a very sensual tale, filled with wonderful images: it includes a great scene where the two lovers compare their heartbeats, with their hands expressing the physical reactions of their bodies; the intense moment when the woman (Mary Duncan) covers her virgin lover's frozen body to revive him; and even a partial nude scene by Farrell, who is very good as the big boy from the mountains who has never known woman. An incredible achievement for 1929. I recommend this collection highly.",1342915200,3,1772,4.7752442996742674
