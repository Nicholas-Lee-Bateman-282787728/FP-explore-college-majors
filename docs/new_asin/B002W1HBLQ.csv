Go sign up disneymovierewards.com and then everytime you buy a disney movie you enter in the code and get points to spend on free stuff, like more movies, gifts, sticker books, lots of fun stuff. Ive gotten lunchboxes etc, - thats not the point, and I don't get points if you sign up, I just think if your checking out disney cartoons you should know. Anyways, I LOVE that they are making Minnie Mouse staring videos, I have a little girl and love that Minnie has her head together and can solve problems, my little one is just starting to love Minnie and Mickey, and this is another great girl power cartoon, and not something where she needs to be rescued.
