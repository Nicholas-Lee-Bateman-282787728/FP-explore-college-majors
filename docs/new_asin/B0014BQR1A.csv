3128134,3,B0014BQR1A,"Review for The Gunfighter
Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

Ironically, in the film The Gunfighter, the man known as the fastest draw in the West only fires his gun once in the beginning of the movie, and the camera doesnt capture it. Gregory Peck plays the title character, Jimmy Ringo, and even though he asks the surrounding witnesses, Did you see that? after the shooting, the audience is left to answer, No!

Ringo is a real-life figure that many people tried to challenge, but he maintained his reputation of having very fast fingers. In the movie, he defends himself in a bar fight, and the dead mans three brothers try to find him and get revenge. In the meantime, Ringo goes back to his hometown, tries to hide from the locals, reconnect with his wife, and meet his son. It has the same feel as other real-time adventures, like High Noon, because Ringo tries to beat the clock, knowing the men are on his tail. I actually found this film much more exciting than High Noon. The tension is high, the acting is good, and its more than easy to root for Gregory Peck.

Gregory Pecks former partner, played by Millard Mitchell, has turned his life around and become town marshal. When the two men reunite, they have great chemistry together. The entire town is set against Peckthey don't want an outlaw in their midstbut Mitchell knows he has good intentions and tries to help him out. My favorite scene is when Peck talks to a few ladies, including Disney voice actress Verna Felton, and they don't know who he is. Theyre talking about what a bully Jimmy Ringo is, and Peck tries to defend the outlaw without being obvious that its him. Its very funny, and also a little nerve-wracking, because what will happen if hes discovered? Find out by watching The Gunfighter!",1502323200,,1770,4.612698412698412

3128136,5,B0014BQR1A,"This is what I love about western movie, the tough cowboy, gunfights, the bar. I felt sorry for this bad guy at the end. It made me read the real history of this famous outlaw. Hollywood made him out to be not so bad of a guy, but they do that with any star character. Gregory Peck was unforgettable in this role.",1486684800,,313,4.064516129032258

3128275,5,B0014BQR1A,"Finally three of my favorite western of that era are available at a great price. I went to see ""Garden of evil"" thee times as a kid, and this is the first time I have ever seen it on VHS or DVD and was thrilled to see it available. Gary Cooper, gambler Richard Widmark, and Cameron Mitchel, become beaded in a mexican seaport,after their ship breaksdown. In a cantina that night Susan Hayward, bursts in needing help freeing her trapped husband(Hugh Marlowe) in a mine back in the mountains. We'll done western style drama. ""RAWHIDE"" Tyrone Powers the son of a wealthy stage coach operator learning the business from the ground up is stationed in a desert stage stop, when Susan Hayward show up with her baby on an incoming stage. They then encounters a gang led by Hugh Marlowe. Great cast for the gang including, George Tobias, Dean Jagger, and a great performance by Jack Elam at his most evil. The third is aGregory Peck western as gunfighter Jimmy Ringo, trying to retire into obscurity, but not doing well at it. Before he disappears he wants to make amends with is wife and son while being perused by ""Skipper"" Alan Hale Jr. And brother over a killed younger brother. Karl Malden plays a bar tender and old friend and saddle pal Millard Mitchell now the town Marshall where his wife live. 20th century fox execs hated him in a mustache but let it ride, and made an interesting western drama.

3128465,5,B0014BQR1A,"Five CLASSIC Stars! ""The Gunfighter"" is a 1950s film that tells a believable tale of the old west. Starring Gregory Peck as an aging famous gunman, Jimmy Ringo, who is traveling through New Mexico on a mission. Before he reaches his destination, he is recognized, called out in a bar, and kills a man. He reaches his destination, but is being pursued by the dead man's brothers, and he gets differing reactions among the townsfolk as the tension builds and he makes some special requests that are the crux of the film as it heads to the ending. Also starring Helen Westcott, Millard Mitchell, Jean Parker, Skip Homeier, and Richard Jaekel. A well-acted western drama that is directed by Henry King. Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars! (20th Century Fox pictures. Not Rated, but contains some violence. Black and White. HD. CC. Time-1:24:33.)",1464652800,,848,4.97887323943662

Find another name for Peck's character.  The plot dragged ever so slightly with the somewhat trite old flame, abandoned son theme, but that was easily sufferable with great performances from Peck, Sheriff Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell), and Karl Malden as barkeep Mac.  I am a little more into the action type westerns, but this one did a really good job of building personalities within the fairly short time frame allowed.  All in all, one of my more favored viewings.",1461974400,,608,4.644859813084112

3128510,5,B0014BQR1A,"Gregory Peck, a solid redemption story, and a complex ending earns five stars in my book.  For those who don't know the story, Peck plays a gunfighter and outlaw who now regrets his past, but he can't outrun his reputation.  He rides into town to tell his old flame that he has changed and to ask her to marry one more time, and discovers that an old outlaw companion has reformed and become sheriff because he was never as well known as Peck.  The sheriff sympathizes with him and tries to help him, but the Sheriff also tells Peck that he has to get out of town by noon.  The clock ticks as Peck tries to outrun his reputation.  As always with older westerns, this may not be for viewers who are over-familiar with the themes because they have been done to death since the movie or who like more modern style of action-adventures/Westerns.",1461542400,,841,4.435064935064935

He yearns for a different life, one which includes his estranged wife and son.  That life is almost in his grasp - I will say no more.  You should see it for yourself.

The Gunfighter on TV one evening.............there...in one scene in an upstairs room while Gregory Peck was talking to a lady.............the picture, the one we own is on the wall.  So, make the

According this perspective, this bleak Western would be the closest one following the rules of the Noir film (so in vogue during the thirties, forties and fifties).

Peck is superb and the cast too. Formidable camera handle for Henry King.

Catch this one!!!",1424822400,,492,4.833333333333333

For some reason that is light years beyond logic, ALL the people of the NM Territory in the 1880s have both photographic memories and nothing to do whenever Johnny Ringo shows up!!  No matter if the town is miles away, as soon as he walks in everyone mysteriously, somehow know him.  What drivel.  And there is little to no character development, with some of the downright silliest dialogue you will ever hear.  What a waste.

3128599,4,B0014BQR1A,"THE GREAT/ THE DECENT / THE UGLY--- The great is ""The Gunfighter""--This movie is incredibly underrated in my opinion.  This along with ""Liberty Valance"" ""The Tall T"" , ""Ride Lonesome"", ""The Ox-bow incident and a few others are the best westerns ever made. The cinematographer was a legend, (he's discussed in the included special features) Peck gives us an awesome performance here. Like Liberty Valance it gives us a lot of different nuances. Peck plays the fastest gun in the west. However he does not carry himself with ego and bravado but rather with maturity developed over the years and wants to step out of the limelight and settle down. Easier said than done. The story is about his attempt at this difficult task. I'm trying to avoid spoilers of any kind as I hate it when people tell you everything that happens in a movie. I will say that the movie is beautifully shot , well acted and the pacing is right on. There's action, introspection,emotion  good interaction between the characters and even a little humor added at just exactly the right dose. THE GUNFIGHTERS IS THE 5 STAR GLOWING PRIZE HERE.----Rawhide is decent --Draw your own conclusions on that one. I give it 3 stars.

3128661,5,B0014BQR1A,"1950's THE GUNFIGHTER directed by Henry King is a great character study of the larger than life notion of the hired gunman. Gregory Peck's performance breaks down the mythology of the Western gunman and makes him a real a man who had hopes and aspirations and saw those dreams slip through his fingers and blow away like tumbleweed.

The script by William Bowers, William Sellers, Andr De Toth and Nunnally Johnson develop a familiar theme that is so central to many Westerns since. The focus is on the one way of life that has been outlived by time, the collapse of open space and the indistinct progress of civilization. And if that way of life has been characterized by human failures and transgressions, is redemption through a return to a conventional life possible?

Director Henry King's use of screen time is quite amazing really. Shot in what can be considered real time, there is not a single shot wasted central to the theme and progression of the storyline. Truly, there is never a dull moment and the viewer is immediately captivated by Peck screen presence.

Alfred Newman's score is very thought provoking and subtle and is an important enhancement to this central theme. THE GUNFIGHTER also has a strong cast that strengthens the narrative with the likes of Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel, Kenneth Tobey, Ellen Corby, Helen Westcott and Alan Hale Jr.",1336953600,,1378,4.880341880341881

Directed by Henry King

In this classic noir-influenced Western, Gregory Peck stars as aging gunslinger Jimmy Ringo, sick of killing but haunted by punks wanting to make a name for themselves by slaying a legend. After being warned by his old friend the Marshal Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell), Ringo decides to return East to see his estranged wife and the child he left behind. Knowing his death is an inevitability if he stays, Ringo leaves but before he can reach his destination his past catches up with him in the form of a young outlaw.

Oscar Nomination for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story (William Bowers & Andr De Toth!)

Special Footnote:  -- Large painting on wall behind Gregory Peck's chair in bar room is ""Custer's Last Fight"", painted in 1884 by Cassily Adams and reproduced as a lithographic print by Otto Becker from Adams's original painting. These prints were distributed in 1896 to bars and taverns all over America by the Anheuser Busch Company.

The Gunfighter was often imitated by other Westerns, most notably by High Noon (1952) and its minimalist, morally difficult, and compelling tale made it one of the most important films produced in the 1950s.

3128673,4,B0014BQR1A,"""The Gunfighter"" is a 1950 western starring Gregory Peck with Helen Wescott, Millard Mitchell, and Karl Malden featuring Richard Jaeckel, Skip Homeier, Verna Felton, and Ellen Corby.

Gregory Peck is a film icon, ranked #12 on the AFI list of Greatest Male Actors. He won an Oscar for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and was nominated 4 more times (""Twelve O'clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""The Yearling"", ""The Keys of the Kingdom""). He was nominated for an Emmy in 1998 for the TV film ""Moby Dick"" for which he won the Golden Globe. He had two other Golden Globe nominations (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Macarthur""). He made 57 films, starting in 1944. This was Peck's third western having played in ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) and ""Yellow Sky"" (1948), and he would make several more (""The Bravados"", ""The Big Country"", ""How the West Was Won"", Mackenna's Gold"")

Millard Mitchell and Peck appeared together in ""Twelve O'clock High"" in 1949 and again in this film. He's best known for his Golden Globe winning performance in ""My Six Convicts"" (1952), and he appeared in more than 30 films. He plays the Marshall and an old friend of Peck.

Helen Wescott plays Peck's estranged wife. This was her most prominent role along with the lead female in ""Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde"" (1953) and the estranged wife of Aldo Ray in ""God's Little Acre"" (1958). From the early 50s on she worked primarily in TV.

Verna Felton appeared in more than a dozen films, but is best well known for her work on TV where she was twice nominated for an Emmy for her work in ""December Bride"" (1954-9). She had recurring roles on several series (""Pete and Gladys"", ""The Jack Benny Show"") and did many voiceovers for characters such as Pearl Slaghopple on ""The Flintstones"", the elephant in ""The Jungle Book"" (1967), the Fairy Godmother in ""Cinderella"" (1950), and Dumbo's grandmother in ""Dumbo"" (1941). She plays the town matriarch, Mrs. Pennyfeather, and in her brief appearance she steals the scene.

Ellen Corby is best remembered as Grandma on ""The Waltons"" for which she won three Emmys and was nominated three more times. In addition, she won the Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress in ""I Remember Mama"" (1948) for which she also received an Oscar nomination. She appeared in more than 200 films and TV shows.

Richard Jaeckel appeared in more than 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor opposite Paul Newman in ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" (1970) but is probably remembered best for his role as the Sergeant in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967). He plays a young punk who challenges Peck to a duel.

Skippy Homeier is one of the few to make the transition from child actor to playing adult roles. He started in 1944 playing a 14 year old Nazi in ""Tomorrow the World"". ""Gunfighter"" was the first of his young adult roles and he followed these with appearances in ""Halls of Montezuma"" (1950), ""Fixed Bayonets"" (1951) and ""The Last Posse"" (1953). He became active in TV in the early 50s and appeared in several series (""Dan Raven"", ""The Interns"").  Homeier plays another punk who challenges Peck.

The film is directed by Henry King. King had been nominated for an Oscar in 1943 (""Song of Bernadette"") and 1944 (""Wilson"") and won the Golden Globe for ""Bernadette"". Following this film he would receive DGA nominations for his work with Peck in ""David and Bathsheba"" (1951) and ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" (1952), and worked with Peck in ""The Bravados"" (1958). He directed more than 100 films between 1915 and 1962.

Screenwriter William Bowers was nominated for an Oscar for his work on this film. His only other major film was ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" (1969) although he penned more than 50 films.

Nunnaly Johnson produced. Johnson was famous for his dark stories (e.g., ""Cardinal Richelieu"", ""The Prisoner of Shark Island"", ""Jesse James"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Dark Mirror"") and his films often had a large psychological aspect to them (e.g., ""Three Faces of Eve"", ""Night People"") and he often worked with Peck (""Night People"", ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"", ""Keys to the Kingdom"").

Peck uses the name ""Jimmy Ringo"" which is fictitious despite the opening screen that attempts to portray this as an historical film. There was a real ""John Peters Ringo"" who was a Texas gunfighter who played a part in the Tombstone battles with Wyatt Earp and was mysteriously killed in July 1882, a few months after the Earps left Tombstone. The TV series ""Johnny Ringo"" (1959-60) was based on him. John Wayne used the name ""The Ringo Kid"" in ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and it is the name of a Marvel comic series (1953-7).

This is not a traditional western. There are no Indians, no Cavalry, no train, no stagecoach, and no cattle, and the horses are only occasionally seen. Most of the action takes place in a bar where Peck is waiting for the Marshall (Mitchell) to arrange a meeting with his estranged wife (Wescott). Meanwhile, he is being stalked by a man who believes Peck killed his son, 3 brothers who are out to avenge the death of their brother (Jaeckel), and a young punk (Homeier) wanting to make his name.

Popular westerns of the 1940s often focused on the gunfighter or the outlaw - ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), Gary Cooper's ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""Belle Starr"" (1941) with Randolph Scott and Gene Tierney, John Wayne's ""Three Godfathers"" (1948), ""Dark Command"" (1940) with John Wayne and Roy Rogers, ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) with Gregory Peck, John Ford's ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), and Howard Hughes' ""The Outlaw"" (1943). Though there were exceptions -  Fritz Lang's ""Western Union"" (1941) with Randolph Scott, John Ford's  ""My Darling Clementine""  (1946), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), and John Wayne's ""Red River"" (1948) - the focus on the outlaw in Westerns mirrored the focus on the gangster in crime dramas. Just as the biggest stars played the gangster, the biggest stars played the outlaws. ""The Gunfighter"" is well within this tradition. It is unique in that it emphasize the psychological and social costs to the gunfighter.

Fans of Westerns may prefer the classic westerns to this one and fans of Gregory Peck in a western might be better served with ""Duel in the Sun"" or ""The Bravados"". But for fans of the outlaw, this film is a welcome change of pace and examines a little explored area.

(FWIW - Peck was offered the role of the sheriff in ""High Noon"", but he thought the idea of a man fighting a town was more or less the theme of this film so he turned down the role. It went to Gary Cooper. Cooper won the Oscar and the Golden Globe as Best Actor and the film won 3 other Oscars and was nominated for 3 more.

My personal ratings for the films would be: The Gunfighter 5/5, Rawhide 3/5 and Garden of Evil 2/5. High quality of this release and the greatness of The Gunfighter with $12.49 still makes it a 5-star purchase.",1243296000,,598,4.6415094339622645
3128681,5,B0014BQR1A,"The 3 movies are classics of the genre. However, Susan Hayward is the leading lady in two (RAWHIDE and GARDEN OF EVIL). There is also a nice bonus feature tribute ""Susan Hayward--Straight Shooter"". And that she was! I thought I reviewed this when it came out, but I was too busy with my writing (novels).

THE GUNFIGHTER is a superior western and I can say no more about this near perfect gem.

GARDEN OF EVIL, is the technicolor extravaganza of the three, but a bit too allegorical, but Hayward is stunning in technicolor and wide screen. RAWHIDE completely deviates from standard western fare, making it the standout of the three.

RAWHIDE deals with Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward being held hostage at a stagecoach way station, by a motley crew of prison escapees. The close ups from the hole being dug through the wall by the two leads are amazing. This is not your typical ""shoot 'em up"" western. The supporting cast is perfect. Hugh Marlow is wonderful as the intellectual leader of the outlaws and a young Jack Elam steals the show as the horny outlaw lusting after Hayward (and who wouldn't). The fine character actor Edgar Buchanan, is seen all too briefly before he meets his demise. One of the best of the genre despite the fact the two leads do not have explosive chemistry, but their acting is first rate. This fine movie was filmed in the famous Lonesome Pines where many a western was made. My one objection to the movie is the score. RAWHIDE utilizes an earlier FOX film BRIGHAM YOUNG, FRONTIERSMAN as it's theme. When the popular Clint Eastwood TV series of the same name was released, the movie's title was changed to DESPERATE SIEGE for several years.

THE GARDEN OF EVIL which also stars Hayward and Marlow in smaller roll, leans too heavily on the good vs evil motive of the human spirit. This has a tendency to bog this near classic western down from its often times exciting plot line. Hayward struggles with a poorly written character, but manages to always capture your attention. Filmed on location in Mexico along with Bernard Herrmann's haunting score, this movie could have been much more than it is. Richard Widmark excellent, Cooper who is showing his age, is too wooden, and Cameron Mitchell is just right in this flawed but near perfect film. During filming, Mitchell made a pass at Hayward, she clawed his face with her fingernails, this holding up shooting several days while Mitchell healed.

Both RAWHIDE and GARDEN OF EVIL made their DVD debuts and they are long overdue. This collection is very eclectic and one of the most interesting box sets released. Three fine and totally unique films in one package from FOX. Miss Hayward was queen of FOX when these films were made, and the camera loves her or studio head Zanuck, ensured it did for his leading lady. It wouldn't have taken much effort in this reviewer's opinion. Susan Hayward was a rare commodity in Hollywood--she not only possessed brains and was strikingly beautiful--she had talent contributing some of the most vivid portrayals on celluloid.",1241913600,,3046,4.783269961977187
3128682,5,B0014BQR1A,"Waiting for years to get my hands on RAWHIDE, I could not have been more delighted with a boxed set of movies.  RAWHIDE, along side of RED RIVER and THE SEARCHERS, is one of my all-time favorite Westerns, although, as others here have noted, it owes some of its atmosphere to the conventions of Film Noir.  It's a gorgeous black and white film -- the longshots of ""Wyoming"" give me the feeling of being inside of an Ansel Adams photograph.  Susan Hayward is her feisty, gorgeous self, Tyrone Power is at his dark, brooding best, and rest of the cast is superb, too, particularly Hugh Marlowe, who gives an unusual, nuanced performance as one of the villains.

I had never seen THE GUNFIGHTER, but had heard for years about how good it is.  It lived up to my expectations.  A thoughtful, adult film, with Gregory Peck in one of his best roles.

The big surprise was GARDEN OF EVIL, which rises above a so-so script to deliver a suspenseful adventure.  Again with Susan Hayward as one of the leads, and Hugh Marlowe (in a small role), this one pairs her with Gary Cooper, looking appropriately rugged and worn.  The real star of this film, though, is the scenery, shot in widescreen Technicolor.  Some of the locations in Mexico are simply breathtaking, but so is some of the great matt painting, used in one of the more harrowing high desert scenes, involving horses and a crumbling rock ""bridge.""  The only criticism I have of this film would be about the same for any movie of this type where Hollywood tried to portray Native Americans.  In this film, especially, they are nothing more than stick figures providing a sense of danger and moving targets for gunfire.  Nevertheless, this is one spectacular picture.

3128684,5,B0014BQR1A,"Twentieth Century Fox issues this 3-pack movie deal of three classic western films from the early fifties. Each film is remastered and loaded with extras and documentaries of the actors and directors. THE GUNFIGHTER, 1950, directed by Henry King, starring the great Gregory Peck, (Jimmy Ringo) tells of an aging gunfighter dwelling on his past and all the dead men he left behind, hoping to change the future with the woman he loves and with his only son. Will fate work in the gunfighter's favor? or will a fatal bullet catch him in the end. An intense western drama with a touch of HIGH NOON. RAWHIDE, 1951, directed by Henry Hathaway, stars Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, and character actor, Jack Elam. A gang of desperate outlaws hold hostage a station worker, with a beautiful woman and her child, while in the process the gang plans to rob the mail stagecoach of it's gold bullion, with the reluctant help of their captives, intense action from beginnung to end. GARDEN OF EVIL, 1954, directed by Henry Hathaway, featuring an all star cast - Gary Cooper, Richard Widmark, Susan Hayward and Cameron Mitchell. A desperate woman walks in a cantina in Mexico offering 1000 dollars to any man willing to help her rescue the man she loves, who is helplessly trapped in a mine shaft filled with gold. A good price but what's the catch? A classic western adventure. The Gunfighter, Rawhide-black and white, full screen, Garden Of Evil-color, 16x9 widescreen.",1234396800,,1455,4.870967741935484
3128685,5,B0014BQR1A,"Gregory Peck is excellent as a former gang member with a legendary fast draw who tries desperately to escape his past and start life anew. This film is an interesting paralell to the modern ""Unforgiven"", in both films legends take a life of their own becoming bigger than the man. The total inability to rest in a town or to make a friend is the curse of the man that is feared by reputation alone as Peck now older and more mature seeks a simple life that seems to constantly elude him. Ringo is constantly challenged by young gunfighters wanting to make a reputation while also being pursued by unknown common individuals who are seeking revenge of a relative who may or may not have been killed by Ringo. Ringo now tries to return to his wife and son and dream of the normal mundane but happy life of a homesteader. It's a battle against time as everything comes to a point with Ringo finally reuniting with his family in a town where everyone knows his identity but his pursuers are closing in. The most piognant part of the film is when a simple ranch owner comes into the saloon for a drink and shares one with Johnny Ringo alone in the bar speaking to him as a regular guy as he talke about his modest ranch and family. The ranch owner is oblivious to the excitment in town and he is the only one unaware that he just shared a drink with the feared Johnny Ringo. Ringo appreciates the conversation and he inhales the man's story of a modest ranch and life and sets his own goal to relocate and reunite his family. The ending is both abrupt and surprising as this is one western that does not fit the mold as someone riding off into the sunset. This is an adult western full of drama with a fitting ending demonstrating the curse of misbegotten fame. Excellent stars, aside from Peck, Karl Malden also appears.",1233705600,,1816,4.407738095238095
3128686,3,B0014BQR1A,"At $10.99, this package is well worth it. None of these movies are classics, but they are pretty solid. I had seen all of them in my youth. ""The Gunfighter"" has held up the best. ""Garden of Evil"" is better than I remembered, and ""Rawhide"" not quite as good. Gary Cooper is equal to himself in ""Garden of Evil."" Gregory Peck shows that he really was the best actor of his generation. He does an excellent job with a ""not really a good guy"" role. Although I like Tyrone Power, he just doesn't quite cut it in ""Rawhide."" It may be a script problem because his character just doesn't seem very defined.",1233360000,,598,4.348214285714286
3128687,5,B0014BQR1A,"Nowadays, the Western is almost a dead genre, a far cry from the days in which it dominated the movies.  Of course, even in its heyday, it had various stages.  Earlier Westerns tended to focus on adventure, with cowboys and Indians and bank robbers.  Around the 1950s, a new subgenre began to appear, the so-called Adult Western.  These Westerns tended to focus more on character and less on action.  The Fox Western Classics features three such movies.

The Gunfighter is considered to be one of the first Adult Westerns, with Gregory Peck has the title character.  He is a man considered the best gunfighter of his era, a title that he is forced to defend.  He takes refuge in the town of Cayenne, where an old friend is marshal and his estranged wife is living under another name with their son.  Even here, however, danger lurk.

Rawhide is perhaps the least ""adult"" of the three movies.  Tyrone Power is working at an isolated stagecoach station and is taken hostage by a band of robbers planning on robbing an incoming, gold-laden stage.  Complicating matters is Susan Hayward and her infant niece who are trapped at the station also.  Hugh Marlowe leads the band of robbers, but it's Jack Elam who provides the real danger.

Hayward and Marlowe are also in Garden of Evil, also directed by Rawhide director Henry Hathaway.  This is the epic of the three, with Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark leading the cast and a young Rita Moreno in one of her first (brief) roles.  It is shot in Cinescope and scored by the great Bernard Hermann. Cooper and Widmark are a couple passengers on a California-bound steamer that is stranded in Mexico with engine problems.  Stuck in port for weeks, they let themselves be hired by Hayward, who needs them to rescue her husband (Marlowe) who's stuck in a mine.  Getting there is an arduous enough trip, but getting back may be more perilous, with Apaches dogging their every move.

In quality terms, these are all four-to-five star movies, and there are enough extras - including commentaries and featurettes - to make this a top notch set.  If you enjoy Westerns, this is a trio of near classics that is worth viewing.",1227398400,,2158,4.704

3128690,3,B0014BQR1A,"This set includes two terrific movies, Henry King's THE GUNFIGHTER with Gregory Peck and Henry Hathaway's RAWHIDE with Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward. The third film, Hathaway's GARDEN OF EVIL with Hayward and Gary Cooper, is much the least of the lot, but at least it has beautiful CinemaScope cinematography that the disc captures very well. It's also regrettable that GARDEN is the only one of the three with a commentary track, doubly so in that the three commentators discuss nothing but Bernard Herrmann's musical score -- a subject in which fans of westerns, Cooper, Hayward or Hathaway will have no interest whatsoever.

On the plus side, as noted, the other two films are terrific, with one of Peck's best-ever performances in THE GUNFIGHTER. Also, the package includes several extras to compensate for the snooze-fest Herrmann commentary: featurettes on Lone Pine, CA, a popular location where over 400 movies were made, on GUNFIGHTER cinematographer Arthur Miller, and on Henry Hathaway, a director whose career and work are decades overdue for the respect they deserve.",1224460800,,1081,5.212643678160919
3128691,4,B0014BQR1A,"Fox has released a terrific 3-disc box set, THE WESTERN CLASSICS, in which we're finally getting a DVD version of one of the most revered westerns ever produced, THE GUNFIGHTER (1950) starring Gregory Peck.

Directed by Henry King in glorious black-and-white, THE GUNFIGHTER is almost a Shakespearean tragedy, and is considered to be the first adult western, predating better known films like HIGH NOON and SHANE.

Peck plays Jimmy Ringo, a notorious gunfighter who would like to bury his reputation, but is forced to keep on the run because young punks keep forcing him to draw.

Currently, he's being pursued by the three brothers of a braggart he killed in self defense, but he stops off in the small town where his estranged wife (Helen Wescott) lives, hoping for a reconciliation.  The sheriff of the town happens to be Millard Mitchell, an old friend and former gunslinger.

Mitchell wants Peck to leave town, but he won't go until Westcott agrees to meet him.  In the meantime, the three brothers are getting closer and, if that's not bad enough, there's a young hothead in town (Skip Homeier) who thinks he's a faster draw than the legendary Jimmy Ringo.

THE GUNFIGHTER may not contain a lot of shoot-'em-up action, but it's filled with a HIGH NOON-like suspense and colorful, multi-dimensional characters.  Karl Malden and Jean Parker co-star.

DVD extras include a featurette on cinematographer Arthur Miller, an artist with black-and-white, and a retrospective ""Making of"" mini-documentary.

Almost as good as THE GUNFIGHTER is RAWHIDE (1951), another beautifully-photographed black-and-white western, directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward and Hugh Marlowe.

Marlowe and his band of ruthless outlaws (Jack Elam, Dean Jagger, George Tobias), all escaped convicts, take control of a desert stagecoach station, run by Edgar Buchanan and his tenderfoot assistant (Power).  They kill Buchanan, then hold Power and stage passenger Hayward (and her baby niece) hostage, waiting for a gold shipment to arrive by coach the next day.

Power knows that, once the outlaws have the gold, they will kill their captives, so he and Hayward desperately devise a plan to thwart their intentions.

RAWHIDE is another suspense-filled western, containing a fair share of surprise plot twists.

DVD extras include featurettes on Ms. Hayward and on Lone Pine, where RAWHIDE, THE GUNFIGHTER and many other classic westerns were shot.

Hathaway, Hayward and Marlowe are also involved in GARDEN OF EVIL (1954), the one disappointing film in this box set.

Shot in CinemaScope and color, the movie features some gorgeous and interesting Mexican scenery and boasts a cast that also includes Gary Cooper, Richard Widmark, Cameron Mitchell and (briefly) Rita Moreno.

The problem with GARDEN OF EVIL is the very talky script, which has its characters doing things that make little or no sense.

Cooper, Widmark and Cooper play three Americans on their way to the California Gold Rush by ship, who get stranded in a small Mexican coastal town and are hired by Hayward to help free her husband (Marlowe) from a mine cave-in.  The problem is that the mine is located deep in the mountains in Apache territory.

DVD extras include a retrospective ""Making of"" featurette and a mini-documentary on director Hathaway.

Price was right so I went ahead and bought them thru Amazon.  Each movie has much to recomend.  GUNFIGHTER is the best with Greg Peck at is best.  Short run time, nice and tight, with a neat ending.  RAWHIDE is a better than average suspense type of western.  Not your usual cowboys and Indians.  Small cast with Tyrone Power a little old for his role.  Susan Hayward does her usual Susan Hayward. GARDEN OF EVIL is wonderfully filmed and the only color one in the lot.  Nice locations with interesting plot.  Characters are almost by the numbers.  You know from the start who will survive and who gets who.  One illogical plot device is that Susan Hayward, again doing her Susan Hayward, rides to a nearby town to get the help of men to help her husband who has been wounded in a gold mine.  This is Indian territory.  No Indians bothered her when she rode to the town, no attack when the team of men and her ride back to the mine.  No attack at the mine itself, but on the way back...there are the Indians attacking like nobody's business.  How is it they didn't attack when she went for help or on to the mine, just on the way back.  Doesn't make sense.  Other than that, good film and music score.",1222128000,,1376,4.3046875

3128696,4,B0014BQR1A,"Anyone who is a fan of the serious/adult western needs to check this set out. They're not your typical chase 'em down, shoot 'em up westerns, they're much more character driven than action driven. This set also has an excellent price which makes it more than a bargain; three quality westerns for much less than $20! The discs are all in the slim-case format.

The Gunfighter was released in 1950 & probably the most critically acclaimed of the three in this set. It's in black & white, directed by Henry King. It's presented in the full screen format (1.33:1). It stars Gregory Peck with a great supporting cast that includes: Helen Westcott, Millard Mitchell, Jean Parker, Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel & Alan Hale, Jr. (Gilligan's Island) in a small role. The Gunfighter is much like a stage play in the way that it's presented.
Jimmy Ringo (Gregory Peck) is a gunfighter in his mid-thirties who's ready to give up the way he lives. Ringo, after killing a young gunny wanting to make a name for himself, is forced to go on the run. His destination is the small town where his wife & son live though no one knows who they are except for Sheriff Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell) who at one time was in Ringo's gang. Ringo wants to settle down, he wants to reunite with his wife & family. She initially refuses to meet with him but is finally convinced to meet with him. They talk & finally agree if Ringo can stay out of trouble for a year then she will reconsider the situation. The problem with this is that the town has its own young gunny, Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier), looking to make a reputation. The final scene is one of Hollywood's most heart touching ever.
Bonus features include ""Arthur Miller: Painter With Light"", ""The Western Genre Grows Up"" among others.

Rawhide was released in 1951. It's in black & white, directed by Henry Hathaway. Rawhide is remake, of sorts, of the 1936 crime drama, Show Them No Mercy. It's also presented in the full screen format (1.33:1). It stars Tyrone Power & Susan Hayward; the supporting cast includes: Hugh Marlowe, Dean Jagger, Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction) & Jack Elam. Elam's role was one of his biggest in the early part of his career.
Rawhide takes place almost entirely at a stagecoach station.
Sam Todd (Edgar Buchanan) is the stationmaster & Tom Owens (Tyrone Power) is his young assistant. Vinnie Holt (Susan Hayward) arrives on the stage with her baby niece. Because there's an outlaw gang on the loose Holt & the baby are forced off the stage remaining at the station. Zimmerman (Hugh Marlowe) arrives posing as a sheriff on the prowl for the gang. In truth, he's the leader of the outlaw gang; they take over the station, killing Todd, to wait for the next stage that has a large gold shipment. Zimmerman thinks that Owens & Holt are married so he spares them & the child. The scenes are tense, in particular the ones where Tevis (Jack Elam) is constantly being out of control & blood thirsty.
Bonus features include ""Susan Hayward: Hollywood's Straight Shooter"" & ""Shoot It in Lone Pine!"" among others.

Garden of Evil was released in 1954. It's in color, directed by Henry Hathaway. It's presented in the widescreen format (2.55:1). It stars Gary Cooper & Susan Hayward; the supporting cast includes Richard Widmark, Hugh Marlowe, Cameron Mitchell, Rita Moreno & Victor Manuel Mendoza. Garden of Evil is the most action packed of the three movies & is the widest in scope in the amount of territory it covers. Much of the dialog is ambiguous: It's more in what they don't say or hint at.
Hooker (Gary Cooper), Fiske (Richard Widmark) & Daly (Cameron Mitchell) are three cowboys who get stranded in Mexico because the steamship they were on needs repairs. They get hired by Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward) at $2,000 apiece to rescue her husband who's trapped in a gold mine. Vicente (Victor Manuel Mendoza), a Mexican, also gets hired to accompany them. She leads them to a remote location where her husband, John Fuller (Hugh Marlowe), has been. Along the way the band of men realize that they are going to have to deal with the Apache before they can return to Puerto Miguel. There is much distrust between the characters; Daly, in particular, is troublesome & headstrong. Though Garden of Evil is a good western, it's the weakest of the three.
Bonus features include ""Travels of a Gunslinger: The Making of the Garden of Evil"", ""Henry Hathaway: When the Going Gets Tough..."" among others.",1220054400,,4467,4.7317073170731705

Any fan of this genre should definitely add this three movie set to their Western collection. This set can't be found just anywhere, and not even Netflix rents these movies.

This is a really fun adventure/western that has Gary Cooper offering lines like ""let's ride!"" and this retort to Susan Hayward's comment about Richard Widmark staying behind to take on the Indians alone; ""Somebody always stays and get's it done.""  I am not a Cooper fan but after seeing him in this film, I better understand his appeal. The source material for the disc is excellent and the widescreen color presentation of some very exotic Mexican locales is worth the price of the dvd.  This film also has a musical score by Bernard Herrmann.

""Rawhide"", directed by Henry Hathaway (as was Garden of Evil)features Tyrone Power and, again, Susan Hayward in a black and white western that is also quite well done.  The dvd presentation is excellent.

Gregory Peck ""stretches"" as an actor by playing a semi-bad guy (complete with a villian's mustache) in ""The Gunfighter"".  Another good western character study and another excellent dvd presentation.

3128710,5,B0014BQR1A,"1954's GARDEN OF EVIL is a Western rich with characterization that seems stereotypical on the surface, but on analysis, runs much deeper. Susan Hayward (an enigmatic heroine) hires a group of stranded travelers in a Mexican waterfront town to follow her to a remote mine where her husband is trapped. The adventurous group is comprised of Gary Cooper (the upright, moralistic hero), Richard Widmark (a cynical witticism spouting gambler), Victor Manuel Mendoza (the good-natured Mexican guide) and Cameron Mitchell (the back-shooting kid gunslinger). They must traverse perilous and dangerous Indian territory to get to the mine, but their motives are unclear. Is it the trapped man, the lure of gold or the subdued sexual attraction that Hayward exudes that drives them? The narrative is a study of personalities in conflict, their motivations, loyalties, cowardice and heroism. Richard Widmark's character comes off as the most interesting. He lingers in the viewer's mind long after the film is over and the question is raised - which is the more honorable: the moralistic hero or the dubiously elegant yet noble rogue? Henry Hathaway is a director known for atmosphere, character and authentic locations. He combines mood and action. This film has all those elements. It is beautifully photographed, yet the picturesque landscapes are juxtaposed with disturbingly photographed death scenes, menacing ever-lurking Indians (always photographed from a distance) and even mysterious looking set designs. The church bell tower sprouting up from the dried lava is all that remains of the town outside the mine and is symbolically ominous in appearance. Frank Fenton's screenplay is filled with vague dialog and only adds to the total feeling of uneasiness that permeates this film. Bernard Herrmann's score accentuates the moodiness of this haunting adventure tale, itself also vague and non-specific. It is very untypical of the Hollywood Western. He achieved a recurrent sense of ominous fate throughout this entire film without the score ever entering into the psychological realm. This is by no means a minor score by Herrmann and I rank this as one of his great scores. GARDEN OF EVIL under Henry Hathaway's direction intelligently yet emotionally integrates the psychological aspects of his characters and even the threatening locale into the action elements found in the standard Western genre to create an unnerving and very thought provoking experience.

1950's THE GUNFIGHTER directed by Henry King is a great character study of the larger than life notion of the hired gunman. Gregory Peck's performance breaks down the mythology of the Western gunman and makes him a real a man who had hopes and aspirations and saw those dreams slip through his fingers and blow away like tumbleweed. The script by William Bowers, William Sellers, Andr De Toth and Nunnally Johnson develop a familiar theme that is so central to many Westerns since. The focus is on the one way of life that has been outlived by time, the collapse of open space and the indistinct progress of civilization. And if that way of life has been characterized by human failures and transgressions, is redemption through a return to a conventional life possible? Alfred Newman's score is very thought provoking and subtle and is a important enhancement to this central theme. THE GUNFIGHTER also has a strong cast that strengthens the narrative with the likes of Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel, Kenneth Tobey, Ellen Corby, Helen Westcott and Alan Hale Jr.

1951's RAWHIDE also directed by Henry Hathaway is a solid entry in the Western genre strong on character motivations and building suspense as outlaws hold citizens captive in a stagecoach station. It has a superlative cast including Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Dean Jagger, Jack Elam, Edgar Buchanan, Hugh Marlowe, Kenneth Tobey and George Tobias. Thomas Little and Stuart A. Reiss designed the primary sets with art designs by Lyle Wheeler and George W. Davis and great camera work by cinematographer Milton Krasner all essential to the central story. Composers Sol Kaplan and Lionel Newman turned in an interesting score.",1207008000,,4163,5.268072289156627
3128711,5,B0014BQR1A,"Three long overdue for DVD Westerns are together in one collection. Each of these movies are great individually, but together, makes this a must-have Western film. Here are the three films -

Rawhide - Rawhide deserves not only a DVD release, but recognition as one of the greatest Westerns ever. Taut, masterful direction by the great Henry Hathaway, and excellent perfomances by everyone makes this a must have film for anyone who loves the Western genre.

Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward are trapped at a stage way station by a gang of desperate criminals. Surprises and tragedy unfold as Power, Hayward, and Hayward's baby try to survive and outwit the criminals.

There are scenes in this film that are so tense that even today's hardened, jaded moviegoers will appreciate. This was not a film with larger than life heroes or cardboard cutout villains, but real people well portrayed with great lines from a magnificent script.

The Gunfighter - Gregory Peck, with his natural, spare acting style, and his folksy, plain demeanor, was a natural for Westerns, and his greatness in this genre was never more evident in this 1950 film, which was one of the earlier psychological Westerns.

Peck plays Jimmie Ringo, the most notorious gunfighter in the West, is running from the brothers of a man he killed. He shows up in a town where his ex-wife lives with their young son. Ringo holds up in the town saloon as a favor to the town marshal, who an old friend, while he waits for an opportunity to see his wife.

Meanwhile, the town is taken over with the nervous enthusiasm of people wanting to see a celebrity, a shootout, or a dead celebrity. At the same time, a young punk, would-be gunfighter has heard that Ringo is in town, and is itching to make his reputation off of killing Ringo.

Everyone delivers excellent performances, and the movie has a lot to say about voyeurism, celebrity, longing, and regret. This is a fantastic movie, and without question, one of the best Westerns ever made.

Garden of Evil - This great Western was never even released on VHS, much less video, which is a shame since it had great performance from two great Western actors, Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark. Cooper, Widmark, and two other soldiers of fortune, played by Cameron Mitchell and Victor Manuel Mendoza, arrive in Mexico having responded to an add to make lots of money. They are greeted by Susan Hayward, who takes them on a perilous journey to rescue her husband, who has been injured in a mining accident. If the journey and the rescue weren't hard enough, the location of the mine in in Indian territory. Soon, alliances are made, broken, and remade, and emotions, greed, and violence ensues.

This film may be regarded as the least of the three by some, but it has terrific acting by all, and is a wonderful showcase of Cooper beginning the twilight phase of his magnificent career, where he tended to play veteran loners who find that they still have lots to live for, and who usually finds love and renewed courage along the way.

All three films are excellent, and should have merited individual releases, making this release combining all three is even more special.",1205539200,,3173,4.773722627737226

Gregory Peck stars as the proverbial gunfighter who is forced into a kill-or-be-killed life.

Jimmy Ringo has legendary speed with a gun, hence every young cowpoke who thinks he's fast wants to kill him to get his reputation.  Peck plays a superb role in this western classic.

3128714,4,B0014BQR1A,"Is there any place, any retreat, any home of retirement, that an inevitably tiring gunman can move on to?

This predicament is best conveyed, explored and given its full tragic weight in Henry King's 'The Gunfighter.'

Ringo (Gregory Peck), wearing his reputation as the fastest gun in the south-west territories like a heavy load, enters each bar warily when he needs a quiet drink, knowing full well the reaction--fear, respect, perhaps admiration, and certainly the intervention in some form or other of a young upstart with itchy gun-fingers.

Although Ringo, guilty for previous sins, tries to refrain and to avoid the shoot-out... But he is always compelled to eliminate the worthless maladjusted gunmen, wishful for a big name...

The pattern is set early on when Peck has to shoot a boy (Richard Jaecke1) in self-defense. And so a feud begins--you feel it's only one of many--with the three brothers of the boy (Alan Hale Jr., David Clarke and John Pickard) hell-bent for revenge...

Peck deals with this situation, at least for the moment, sighs and then moves on to a place that passes for home... Here is his wife (Helen Westcott) and his son, who won't, however, be providing him with a welcome since in the eight years that husband and family have been apart the wife has been trying to build a life of their own... Here also is a sheriff (Millard Mitchell) formerly engaged in Peck's outlaw activities, but now reformed, and an old girl friend (Jean Parker) ready to he1p him in anything that concerns him most... His actual concern is reconciliation with his wife and a new life together... There is a tentative rapprochement but, of course, there is another of those young contender interventions, this time in the person of Skip Homeier...

Henry King draws up carefully the ultimate end of the 'top gun of the West.' His film is an inclination towards a classical tragedy, destined to be destroyed inevitably... Peck strikes the right note from his first edgy entry... He wants to shake off his past... He is disgusted to kill in order to survive... He is aimless for a change, sick with death and glory, showing tiredness of killing, conscious to a tragic fate one day...

Peck is superb in his brief and nervy reunion with his small son, impressed like the rest of the local kids by the fact that Jimmy Ringo, the gunfighter, is in town...

""The Gunfighter"", keen and penetrating, explosive and tense, is beautifully acted, tautly directed and superbly photographed by Arthur Miller in black-and-white...",1163030400,,2524,4.894613583138173

He is headed home to Cayenne to reunite with his wife and young son from whom he has been estranged for eight years.
Along the dusty trail, he stops to rest and quench his thirst at a saloon, where he is soon recognized by the locals.

Everything about this film is spot-on perfect, from the cinematography and acting to the costuming, sound, blocking and general attention to detail... not to mention the script!  Gregory Peck stars as Jimmy Ringo, the fastest gun in the West, now turning to middle age, and ready to give up the life of a violent roustabout.  The trouble is, of course, that everywhere he goes, people know and fear him, and every would-be badman in the territory wants to knock him down a peg or two.  It's an old story, repeated in numerous pulps, films, dime novels and comicbooks over the years, but probably never as tersely and tensely as here.  Honestly, there's not a false or flat moment in this film; director Henry King delivers a mournful masterpiece, and Peck is stunning in his role as a weatherbeaten, tired old gunny who'd gladly chuck it all in, if it weren't for the burdensome reputation he'd spent his entire youth building.  Fans of the ""Lonesome Dove"" series should recognize the imprint of Jimmy Ringo, and his erstwhile pal, now the town marshall,  Mark Strett (played perfectly by Millard Mitchell), two old-timers who know that the hard life isn't really as glamourous as most folks think.

3128720,5,B0014BQR1A,"This could be the best western I have ever seen. Mostly because of its noir elements and absolutely standout performances, especially by Gregory Peck as the haunted gunfighter trying to leave his past behind, and by Millard Mitchell as his old partner-in-crime-turned-sheriff. I knew immediately upon watching this for the first time tonight that this was not your typical western. It quietly conveys doom almost from the beginning. I sensed a bleak outlook for Peck's character, Jimmy Ringo, from the start, and the movie conveys this mood very subtly throughout, building to the inevitable conclusion in understated and graceful tones.

That said, this movie has several very brief but very humorous moments that had me laughing outright because they caught me completely off guard. These humorous snippets will pass you by completely if you're not watching closely. And even if you are watching closely, they are so understated that you still could miss them. I'll give you a few of these scenes to watch for: When the old man comes in to talk to the sheriff (while the sheriff is talking to Ringo) to tell him someone set his house on fire (spot-on comedic timing by all concerned), when the kid who wants to gun down Ringo comes in for a haircut, makes boasts, then leaves. After he leaves, one of the men in the shop makes a comment (again, perfect timing). There's about three more that I noticed, but there could be more. As I said, it flies by so naturally, I'm guessing most people wouldn't notice it. Very subtle humor.

But this film is a strange sort of tragedy first and foremost, and the noirish element is definitely prominent throughout. It's amazing to me that all the actors' performances are toned down so far that they hardly move at times, and yet these performances are some of the most powerful I've ever seen. Director Henry King should have gotten an award for creating this masterpiece of understatement. If you're a fan of westerns or noir, you can't go wrong.

Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

Ironically, in the film The Gunfighter, the man known as the fastest draw in the West only fires his gun once in the beginning of the movie, and the camera doesnt capture it. Gregory Peck plays the title character, Jimmy Ringo, and even though he asks the surrounding witnesses, Did you see that? after the shooting, the audience is left to answer, No!

Ringo is a real-life figure that many people tried to challenge, but he maintained his reputation of having very fast fingers. In the movie, he defends himself in a bar fight, and the dead mans three brothers try to find him and get revenge. In the meantime, Ringo goes back to his hometown, tries to hide from the locals, reconnect with his wife, and meet his son. It has the same feel as other real-time adventures, like High Noon, because Ringo tries to beat the clock, knowing the men are on his tail. I actually found this film much more exciting than High Noon. The tension is high, the acting is good, and its more than easy to root for Gregory Peck.

Gregory Pecks former partner, played by Millard Mitchell, has turned his life around and become town marshal. When the two men reunite, they have great chemistry together. The entire town is set against Peckthey don't want an outlaw in their midstbut Mitchell knows he has good intentions and tries to help him out. My favorite scene is when Peck talks to a few ladies, including Disney voice actress Verna Felton, and they don't know who he is. Theyre talking about what a bully Jimmy Ringo is, and Peck tries to defend the outlaw without being obvious that its him. Its very funny, and also a little nerve-wracking, because what will happen if hes discovered? Find out by watching The Gunfighter!",1502323200,,1770,4.612698412698412

I went to see ""Garden of evil"" thee times as a kid, and this is the first time I have ever seen it on VHS or DVD and was thrilled to see it available. Gary Cooper, gambler Richard Widmark, and Cameron Mitchel, become beaded in a mexican seaport,after their ship breaksdown. In a cantina that night Susan Hayward, bursts in needing help freeing her trapped husband(Hugh Marlowe) in a mine back in the mountains. We'll done western style drama. ""RAWHIDE"" Tyrone Powers the son of a wealthy stage coach operator learning the business from the ground up is stationed in a desert stage stop, when Susan Hayward show up with her baby on an incoming stage. They then encounters a gang led by Hugh Marlowe. Great cast for the gang including, George Tobias, Dean Jagger, and a great performance by Jack Elam at his most evil. The third is aGregory Peck western as gunfighter Jimmy Ringo, trying to retire into obscurity, but not doing well at it. Before he disappears he wants to make amends with is wife and son while being perused by ""Skipper"" Alan Hale Jr. And brother over a killed younger brother. Karl Malden plays a bar tender and old friend and saddle pal Millard Mitchell now the town Marshall where his wife live. 20th century fox execs hated him in a mustache but let it ride, and made an interesting western drama.

3362962,5,B0014BQR1A,"Five CLASSIC Stars! ""The Gunfighter"" is a 1950s film that tells a believable tale of the old west. Starring Gregory Peck as an aging famous gunman, Jimmy Ringo, who is traveling through New Mexico on a mission. Before he reaches his destination, he is recognized, called out in a bar, and kills a man. He reaches his destination, but is being pursued by the dead man's brothers, and he gets differing reactions among the townsfolk as the tension builds and he makes some special requests that are the crux of the film as it heads to the ending. Also starring Helen Westcott, Millard Mitchell, Jean Parker, Skip Homeier, and Richard Jaekel. A well-acted western drama that is directed by Henry King. Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars! (20th Century Fox pictures. Not Rated, but contains some violence. Black and White. HD. CC. Time-1:24:33.)",1464652800,,848,4.97887323943662

3363000,4,B0014BQR1A,"This movie fell a star for me just with the ""Ringo"" name.  As a fan of old westerns, that name was used and abused and reused some more.  Find another name for Peck's character.  The plot dragged ever so slightly with the somewhat trite old flame, abandoned son theme, but that was easily sufferable with great performances from Peck, Sheriff Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell), and Karl Malden as barkeep Mac.  I am a little more into the action type westerns, but this one did a really good job of building personalities within the fairly short time frame allowed.  All in all, one of my more favored viewings.",1461974400,,608,4.644859813084112

3363007,5,B0014BQR1A,"Gregory Peck, a solid redemption story, and a complex ending earns five stars in my book.  For those who don't know the story, Peck plays a gunfighter and outlaw who now regrets his past, but he can't outrun his reputation.  He rides into town to tell his old flame that he has changed and to ask her to marry one more time, and discovers that an old outlaw companion has reformed and become sheriff because he was never as well known as Peck.  The sheriff sympathizes with him and tries to help him, but the Sheriff also tells Peck that he has to get out of town by noon.  The clock ticks as Peck tries to outrun his reputation.  As always with older westerns, this may not be for viewers who are over-familiar with the themes because they have been done to death since the movie or who like more modern style of action-adventures/Westerns.",1461542400,,841,4.435064935064935

Gregory Peck turns in a strong performance as aging gunfighter Jimmy Ringo.  A man tired of the lifestyle, the fame, the violence and the people trying to kill him.  He yearns for a different life, one which includes his estranged wife and son.  That life is almost in his grasp - I will say no more.  You should see it for yourself.

3363092,1,B0014BQR1A,"This is about as poorly written western as I have seen, surprised that Peck got ""roped"" into it.  Simplistic, pedantic, and downright foolish.  For some reason that is light years beyond logic, ALL the people of the NM Territory in the 1880s have both photographic memories and nothing to do whenever Johnny Ringo shows up!!  No matter if the town is miles away, as soon as he walks in everyone mysteriously, somehow know him.  What drivel.

3363096,4,B0014BQR1A,"THE GREAT/ THE DECENT / THE UGLY--- The great is ""The Gunfighter""--This movie is incredibly underrated in my opinion.  This along with ""Liberty Valance"" ""The Tall T"" , ""Ride Lonesome"", ""The Ox-bow incident and a few others are the best westerns ever made. The cinematographer was a legend, (he's discussed in the included special features) Peck gives us an awesome performance here. Like Liberty Valance it gives us a lot of different nuances. Peck plays the fastest gun in the west. However he does not carry himself with ego and bravado but rather with maturity developed over the years and wants to step out of the limelight and settle down. Easier said than done. The story is about his attempt at this difficult task. I'm trying to avoid spoilers of any kind as I hate it when people tell you everything that happens in a movie. I will say that the movie is beautifully shot , well acted and the pacing is right on. There's action, introspection,emotion  good interaction between the characters and even a little humor added at just exactly the right dose. THE GUNFIGHTERS IS THE 5 STAR GLOWING PRIZE HERE.----Rawhide is decent --Draw your own conclusions on that one. I give it 3 stars.

3363158,5,B0014BQR1A,"1950's THE GUNFIGHTER directed by Henry King is a great character study of the larger than life notion of the hired gunman. Gregory Peck's performance breaks down the mythology of the Western gunman and makes him a real a man who had hopes and aspirations and saw those dreams slip through his fingers and blow away like tumbleweed.

The script by William Bowers, William Sellers, Andr De Toth and Nunnally Johnson develop a familiar theme that is so central to many Westerns since. The focus is on the one way of life that has been outlived by time, the collapse of open space and the indistinct progress of civilization. And if that way of life has been characterized by human failures and transgressions, is redemption through a return to a conventional life possible?

Director Henry King's use of screen time is quite amazing really. Shot in what can be considered real time, there is not a single shot wasted central to the theme and progression of the storyline. Truly, there is never a dull moment and the viewer is immediately captivated by Peck screen presence.

Alfred Newman's score is very thought provoking and subtle and is an important enhancement to this central theme. THE GUNFIGHTER also has a strong cast that strengthens the narrative with the likes of Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel, Kenneth Tobey, Ellen Corby, Helen Westcott and Alan Hale Jr.",1336953600,,1378,4.880341880341881

Directed by Henry King

In this classic noir-influenced Western, Gregory Peck stars as aging gunslinger Jimmy Ringo, sick of killing but haunted by punks wanting to make a name for themselves by slaying a legend. After being warned by his old friend the Marshal Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell), Ringo decides to return East to see his estranged wife and the child he left behind. Knowing his death is an inevitability if he stays, Ringo leaves but before he can reach his destination his past catches up with him in the form of a young outlaw.

Oscar Nomination for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story (William Bowers & Andr De Toth!)

Special Footnote:  -- Large painting on wall behind Gregory Peck's chair in bar room is ""Custer's Last Fight"", painted in 1884 by Cassily Adams and reproduced as a lithographic print by Otto Becker from Adams's original painting. These prints were distributed in 1896 to bars and taverns all over America by the Anheuser Busch Company.

The Gunfighter was often imitated by other Westerns, most notably by High Noon (1952) and its minimalist, morally difficult, and compelling tale made it one of the most important films produced in the 1950s.

3363170,4,B0014BQR1A,"""The Gunfighter"" is a 1950 western starring Gregory Peck with Helen Wescott, Millard Mitchell, and Karl Malden featuring Richard Jaeckel, Skip Homeier, Verna Felton, and Ellen Corby.

Gregory Peck is a film icon, ranked #12 on the AFI list of Greatest Male Actors. He won an Oscar for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and was nominated 4 more times (""Twelve O'clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""The Yearling"", ""The Keys of the Kingdom""). He was nominated for an Emmy in 1998 for the TV film ""Moby Dick"" for which he won the Golden Globe. He had two other Golden Globe nominations (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Macarthur""). He made 57 films, starting in 1944. This was Peck's third western having played in ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) and ""Yellow Sky"" (1948), and he would make several more (""The Bravados"", ""The Big Country"", ""How the West Was Won"", Mackenna's Gold"")

Millard Mitchell and Peck appeared together in ""Twelve O'clock High"" in 1949 and again in this film. He's best known for his Golden Globe winning performance in ""My Six Convicts"" (1952), and he appeared in more than 30 films. He plays the Marshall and an old friend of Peck.

Helen Wescott plays Peck's estranged wife. This was her most prominent role along with the lead female in ""Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde"" (1953) and the estranged wife of Aldo Ray in ""God's Little Acre"" (1958). From the early 50s on she worked primarily in TV.

Verna Felton appeared in more than a dozen films, but is best well known for her work on TV where she was twice nominated for an Emmy for her work in ""December Bride"" (1954-9). She had recurring roles on several series (""Pete and Gladys"", ""The Jack Benny Show"") and did many voiceovers for characters such as Pearl Slaghopple on ""The Flintstones"", the elephant in ""The Jungle Book"" (1967), the Fairy Godmother in ""Cinderella"" (1950), and Dumbo's grandmother in ""Dumbo"" (1941). She plays the town matriarch, Mrs. Pennyfeather, and in her brief appearance she steals the scene.

Ellen Corby is best remembered as Grandma on ""The Waltons"" for which she won three Emmys and was nominated three more times. In addition, she won the Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress in ""I Remember Mama"" (1948) for which she also received an Oscar nomination. She appeared in more than 200 films and TV shows.

Richard Jaeckel appeared in more than 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor opposite Paul Newman in ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" (1970) but is probably remembered best for his role as the Sergeant in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967). He plays a young punk who challenges Peck to a duel.

Skippy Homeier is one of the few to make the transition from child actor to playing adult roles. He started in 1944 playing a 14 year old Nazi in ""Tomorrow the World"". ""Gunfighter"" was the first of his young adult roles and he followed these with appearances in ""Halls of Montezuma"" (1950), ""Fixed Bayonets"" (1951) and ""The Last Posse"" (1953). He became active in TV in the early 50s and appeared in several series (""Dan Raven"", ""The Interns"").  Homeier plays another punk who challenges Peck.

The film is directed by Henry King. King had been nominated for an Oscar in 1943 (""Song of Bernadette"") and 1944 (""Wilson"") and won the Golden Globe for ""Bernadette"". Following this film he would receive DGA nominations for his work with Peck in ""David and Bathsheba"" (1951) and ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" (1952), and worked with Peck in ""The Bravados"" (1958). He directed more than 100 films between 1915 and 1962.

Screenwriter William Bowers was nominated for an Oscar for his work on this film. His only other major film was ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" (1969) although he penned more than 50 films.

Nunnaly Johnson produced. Johnson was famous for his dark stories (e.g., ""Cardinal Richelieu"", ""The Prisoner of Shark Island"", ""Jesse James"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Dark Mirror"") and his films often had a large psychological aspect to them (e.g., ""Three Faces of Eve"", ""Night People"") and he often worked with Peck (""Night People"", ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"", ""Keys to the Kingdom"").

Peck uses the name ""Jimmy Ringo"" which is fictitious despite the opening screen that attempts to portray this as an historical film. There was a real ""John Peters Ringo"" who was a Texas gunfighter who played a part in the Tombstone battles with Wyatt Earp and was mysteriously killed in July 1882, a few months after the Earps left Tombstone. The TV series ""Johnny Ringo"" (1959-60) was based on him. John Wayne used the name ""The Ringo Kid"" in ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and it is the name of a Marvel comic series (1953-7).

This is not a traditional western. There are no Indians, no Cavalry, no train, no stagecoach, and no cattle, and the horses are only occasionally seen. Most of the action takes place in a bar where Peck is waiting for the Marshall (Mitchell) to arrange a meeting with his estranged wife (Wescott). Meanwhile, he is being stalked by a man who believes Peck killed his son, 3 brothers who are out to avenge the death of their brother (Jaeckel), and a young punk (Homeier) wanting to make his name.

Popular westerns of the 1940s often focused on the gunfighter or the outlaw - ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), Gary Cooper's ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""Belle Starr"" (1941) with Randolph Scott and Gene Tierney, John Wayne's ""Three Godfathers"" (1948), ""Dark Command"" (1940) with John Wayne and Roy Rogers, ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) with Gregory Peck, John Ford's ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), and Howard Hughes' ""The Outlaw"" (1943). Though there were exceptions -  Fritz Lang's ""Western Union"" (1941) with Randolph Scott, John Ford's  ""My Darling Clementine""  (1946), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), and John Wayne's ""Red River"" (1948) - the focus on the outlaw in Westerns mirrored the focus on the gangster in crime dramas. Just as the biggest stars played the gangster, the biggest stars played the outlaws. ""The Gunfighter"" is well within this tradition. It is unique in that it emphasize the psychological and social costs to the gunfighter.

Fans of Westerns may prefer the classic westerns to this one and fans of Gregory Peck in a western might be better served with ""Duel in the Sun"" or ""The Bravados"". But for fans of the outlaw, this film is a welcome change of pace and examines a little explored area.

(FWIW - Peck was offered the role of the sheriff in ""High Noon"", but he thought the idea of a man fighting a town was more or less the theme of this film so he turned down the role. It went to Gary Cooper. Cooper won the Oscar and the Golden Globe as Best Actor and the film won 3 other Oscars and was nominated for 3 more.

As for the other two, I threw them away, a cheap price to pay for one good movie. Garden of Evil?

Rawhide was also enjoyable, as it was nice too see Tyrone Power in a slightly different role than usual and also young Jack Elam having a rather big role. Personally I didn't like very much about Garden of Evil, but it too has its fans and was worth watching looking nonetheless.

My personal ratings for the films would be: The Gunfighter 5/5, Rawhide 3/5 and Garden of Evil 2/5. High quality of this release and the greatness of The Gunfighter with $12.49 still makes it a 5-star purchase.",1243296000,,598,4.6415094339622645
3363178,5,B0014BQR1A,"The 3 movies are classics of the genre. However, Susan Hayward is the leading lady in two (RAWHIDE and GARDEN OF EVIL). There is also a nice bonus feature tribute ""Susan Hayward--Straight Shooter"". And that she was! I thought I reviewed this when it came out, but I was too busy with my writing (novels).

THE GUNFIGHTER is a superior western and I can say no more about this near perfect gem.

GARDEN OF EVIL, is the technicolor extravaganza of the three, but a bit too allegorical, but Hayward is stunning in technicolor and wide screen. RAWHIDE completely deviates from standard western fare, making it the standout of the three.

RAWHIDE deals with Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward being held hostage at a stagecoach way station, by a motley crew of prison escapees. The close ups from the hole being dug through the wall by the two leads are amazing. This is not your typical ""shoot 'em up"" western. The supporting cast is perfect. Hugh Marlow is wonderful as the intellectual leader of the outlaws and a young Jack Elam steals the show as the horny outlaw lusting after Hayward (and who wouldn't). The fine character actor Edgar Buchanan, is seen all too briefly before he meets his demise. One of the best of the genre despite the fact the two leads do not have explosive chemistry, but their acting is first rate. This fine movie was filmed in the famous Lonesome Pines where many a western was made. My one objection to the movie is the score. RAWHIDE utilizes an earlier FOX film BRIGHAM YOUNG, FRONTIERSMAN as it's theme. When the popular Clint Eastwood TV series of the same name was released, the movie's title was changed to DESPERATE SIEGE for several years.

THE GARDEN OF EVIL which also stars Hayward and Marlow in smaller roll, leans too heavily on the good vs evil motive of the human spirit. This has a tendency to bog this near classic western down from its often times exciting plot line. Hayward struggles with a poorly written character, but manages to always capture your attention. Filmed on location in Mexico along with Bernard Herrmann's haunting score, this movie could have been much more than it is. Richard Widmark excellent, Cooper who is showing his age, is too wooden, and Cameron Mitchell is just right in this flawed but near perfect film. During filming, Mitchell made a pass at Hayward, she clawed his face with her fingernails, this holding up shooting several days while Mitchell healed.

Both RAWHIDE and GARDEN OF EVIL made their DVD debuts and they are long overdue. This collection is very eclectic and one of the most interesting box sets released. Three fine and totally unique films in one package from FOX. Miss Hayward was queen of FOX when these films were made, and the camera loves her or studio head Zanuck, ensured it did for his leading lady. It wouldn't have taken much effort in this reviewer's opinion. Susan Hayward was a rare commodity in Hollywood--she not only possessed brains and was strikingly beautiful--she had talent contributing some of the most vivid portrayals on celluloid.",1241913600,,3046,4.783269961977187
3363179,5,B0014BQR1A,"Waiting for years to get my hands on RAWHIDE, I could not have been more delighted with a boxed set of movies.  RAWHIDE, along side of RED RIVER and THE SEARCHERS, is one of my all-time favorite Westerns, although, as others here have noted, it owes some of its atmosphere to the conventions of Film Noir.  It's a gorgeous black and white film -- the longshots of ""Wyoming"" give me the feeling of being inside of an Ansel Adams photograph.  Susan Hayward is her feisty, gorgeous self, Tyrone Power is at his dark, brooding best, and rest of the cast is superb, too, particularly Hugh Marlowe, who gives an unusual, nuanced performance as one of the villains.

I had never seen THE GUNFIGHTER, but had heard for years about how good it is.  It lived up to my expectations.  A thoughtful, adult film, with Gregory Peck in one of his best roles.

The big surprise was GARDEN OF EVIL, which rises above a so-so script to deliver a suspenseful adventure.  Again with Susan Hayward as one of the leads, and Hugh Marlowe (in a small role), this one pairs her with Gary Cooper, looking appropriately rugged and worn.  The real star of this film, though, is the scenery, shot in widescreen Technicolor.  Some of the locations in Mexico are simply breathtaking, but so is some of the great matt painting, used in one of the more harrowing high desert scenes, involving horses and a crumbling rock ""bridge.""  The only criticism I have of this film would be about the same for any movie of this type where Hollywood tried to portray Native Americans.  In this film, especially, they are nothing more than stick figures providing a sense of danger and moving targets for gunfire.  Nevertheless, this is one spectacular picture.

Nice to get a set of three movies for one film, which is not available separately, and end up, for a change, satisfied with the entire package!",1235260800,,1859,4.6452599388379205

3363182,5,B0014BQR1A,"Gregory Peck is excellent as a former gang member with a legendary fast draw who tries desperately to escape his past and start life anew. This film is an interesting paralell to the modern ""Unforgiven"", in both films legends take a life of their own becoming bigger than the man. The total inability to rest in a town or to make a friend is the curse of the man that is feared by reputation alone as Peck now older and more mature seeks a simple life that seems to constantly elude him. Ringo is constantly challenged by young gunfighters wanting to make a reputation while also being pursued by unknown common individuals who are seeking revenge of a relative who may or may not have been killed by Ringo. Ringo now tries to return to his wife and son and dream of the normal mundane but happy life of a homesteader. It's a battle against time as everything comes to a point with Ringo finally reuniting with his family in a town where everyone knows his identity but his pursuers are closing in. The most piognant part of the film is when a simple ranch owner comes into the saloon for a drink and shares one with Johnny Ringo alone in the bar speaking to him as a regular guy as he talke about his modest ranch and family. The ranch owner is oblivious to the excitment in town and he is the only one unaware that he just shared a drink with the feared Johnny Ringo. Ringo appreciates the conversation and he inhales the man's story of a modest ranch and life and sets his own goal to relocate and reunite his family. The ending is both abrupt and surprising as this is one western that does not fit the mold as someone riding off into the sunset. This is an adult western full of drama with a fitting ending demonstrating the curse of misbegotten fame.

Gregory Peck shows that he really was the best actor of his generation. He does an excellent job with a ""not really a good guy"" role. Although I like Tyrone Power, he just doesn't quite cut it in ""Rawhide."" It may be a script problem because his character just doesn't seem very defined.",1233360000,,598,4.348214285714286
3363184,5,B0014BQR1A,"Nowadays, the Western is almost a dead genre, a far cry from the days in which it dominated the movies.  Of course, even in its heyday, it had various stages.  Earlier Westerns tended to focus on adventure, with cowboys and Indians and bank robbers.  Around the 1950s, a new subgenre began to appear, the so-called Adult Western.  These Westerns tended to focus more on character and less on action.  The Fox Western Classics features three such movies.

The Gunfighter is considered to be one of the first Adult Westerns, with Gregory Peck has the title character.  He is a man considered the best gunfighter of his era, a title that he is forced to defend.  He takes refuge in the town of Cayenne, where an old friend is marshal and his estranged wife is living under another name with their son.  Even here, however, danger lurk.

Rawhide is perhaps the least ""adult"" of the three movies.  Tyrone Power is working at an isolated stagecoach station and is taken hostage by a band of robbers planning on robbing an incoming, gold-laden stage.  Complicating matters is Susan Hayward and her infant niece who are trapped at the station also.  Hugh Marlowe leads the band of robbers, but it's Jack Elam who provides the real danger.

Hayward and Marlowe are also in Garden of Evil, also directed by Rawhide director Henry Hathaway.  This is the epic of the three, with Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark leading the cast and a young Rita Moreno in one of her first (brief) roles.  It is shot in Cinescope and scored by the great Bernard Hermann. Cooper and Widmark are a couple passengers on a California-bound steamer that is stranded in Mexico with engine problems.  Stuck in port for weeks, they let themselves be hired by Hayward, who needs them to rescue her husband (Marlowe) who's stuck in a mine.  Getting there is an arduous enough trip, but getting back may be more perilous, with Apaches dogging their every move.

In quality terms, these are all four-to-five star movies, and there are enough extras - including commentaries and featurettes - to make this a top notch set.  If you enjoy Westerns, this is a trio of near classics that is worth viewing.",1227398400,,2158,4.704

3363188,4,B0014BQR1A,"Fox has released a terrific 3-disc box set, THE WESTERN CLASSICS, in which we're finally getting a DVD version of one of the most revered westerns ever produced, THE GUNFIGHTER (1950) starring Gregory Peck.

Directed by Henry King in glorious black-and-white, THE GUNFIGHTER is almost a Shakespearean tragedy, and is considered to be the first adult western, predating better known films like HIGH NOON and SHANE.

Peck plays Jimmy Ringo, a notorious gunfighter who would like to bury his reputation, but is forced to keep on the run because young punks keep forcing him to draw.

Currently, he's being pursued by the three brothers of a braggart he killed in self defense, but he stops off in the small town where his estranged wife (Helen Wescott) lives, hoping for a reconciliation.  The sheriff of the town happens to be Millard Mitchell, an old friend and former gunslinger.

Mitchell wants Peck to leave town, but he won't go until Westcott agrees to meet him.  In the meantime, the three brothers are getting closer and, if that's not bad enough, there's a young hothead in town (Skip Homeier) who thinks he's a faster draw than the legendary Jimmy Ringo.

THE GUNFIGHTER may not contain a lot of shoot-'em-up action, but it's filled with a HIGH NOON-like suspense and colorful, multi-dimensional characters.  Karl Malden and Jean Parker co-star.

DVD extras include a featurette on cinematographer Arthur Miller, an artist with black-and-white, and a retrospective ""Making of"" mini-documentary.

Almost as good as THE GUNFIGHTER is RAWHIDE (1951), another beautifully-photographed black-and-white western, directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward and Hugh Marlowe.

Marlowe and his band of ruthless outlaws (Jack Elam, Dean Jagger, George Tobias), all escaped convicts, take control of a desert stagecoach station, run by Edgar Buchanan and his tenderfoot assistant (Power).  They kill Buchanan, then hold Power and stage passenger Hayward (and her baby niece) hostage, waiting for a gold shipment to arrive by coach the next day.

Power knows that, once the outlaws have the gold, they will kill their captives, so he and Hayward desperately devise a plan to thwart their intentions.

RAWHIDE is another suspense-filled western, containing a fair share of surprise plot twists.

DVD extras include featurettes on Ms. Hayward and on Lone Pine, where RAWHIDE, THE GUNFIGHTER and many other classic westerns were shot.

Hathaway, Hayward and Marlowe are also involved in GARDEN OF EVIL (1954), the one disappointing film in this box set.

Shot in CinemaScope and color, the movie features some gorgeous and interesting Mexican scenery and boasts a cast that also includes Gary Cooper, Richard Widmark, Cameron Mitchell and (briefly) Rita Moreno.

The problem with GARDEN OF EVIL is the very talky script, which has its characters doing things that make little or no sense.

Cooper, Widmark and Cooper play three Americans on their way to the California Gold Rush by ship, who get stranded in a small Mexican coastal town and are hired by Hayward to help free her husband (Marlowe) from a mine cave-in.  The problem is that the mine is located deep in the mountains in Apache territory.

Price was right so I went ahead and bought them thru Amazon.  Each movie has much to recomend.  GUNFIGHTER is the best with Greg Peck at is best.  Short run time, nice and tight, with a neat ending.  RAWHIDE is a better than average suspense type of western.  Not your usual cowboys and Indians.  Small cast with Tyrone Power a little old for his role.  Susan Hayward does her usual Susan Hayward. GARDEN OF EVIL is wonderfully filmed and the only color one in the lot.  Nice locations with interesting plot.  Characters are almost by the numbers.  You know from the start who will survive and who gets who.  One illogical plot device is that Susan Hayward, again doing her Susan Hayward, rides to a nearby town to get the help of men to help her husband who has been wounded in a gold mine.  This is Indian territory.  No Indians bothered her when she rode to the town, no attack when the team of men and her ride back to the mine.  No attack at the mine itself, but on the way back...there are the Indians attacking like nobody's business.  How is it they didn't attack when she went for help or on to the mine, just on the way back.  Doesn't make sense.  Other than that, good film and music score.",1222128000,,1376,4.3046875

3363193,4,B0014BQR1A,"Anyone who is a fan of the serious/adult western needs to check this set out. They're not your typical chase 'em down, shoot 'em up westerns, they're much more character driven than action driven. This set also has an excellent price which makes it more than a bargain; three quality westerns for much less than $20! The discs are all in the slim-case format.

The Gunfighter was released in 1950 & probably the most critically acclaimed of the three in this set. It's in black & white, directed by Henry King. It's presented in the full screen format (1.33:1). It stars Gregory Peck with a great supporting cast that includes: Helen Westcott, Millard Mitchell, Jean Parker, Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel & Alan Hale, Jr. (Gilligan's Island) in a small role. The Gunfighter is much like a stage play in the way that it's presented.
Jimmy Ringo (Gregory Peck) is a gunfighter in his mid-thirties who's ready to give up the way he lives. Ringo, after killing a young gunny wanting to make a name for himself, is forced to go on the run. His destination is the small town where his wife & son live though no one knows who they are except for Sheriff Mark Strett (Millard Mitchell) who at one time was in Ringo's gang. Ringo wants to settle down, he wants to reunite with his wife & family. She initially refuses to meet with him but is finally convinced to meet with him. They talk & finally agree if Ringo can stay out of trouble for a year then she will reconsider the situation. The problem with this is that the town has its own young gunny, Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier), looking to make a reputation. The final scene is one of Hollywood's most heart touching ever.
Bonus features include ""Arthur Miller: Painter With Light"", ""The Western Genre Grows Up"" among others.

Rawhide was released in 1951. It's in black & white, directed by Henry Hathaway. Rawhide is remake, of sorts, of the 1936 crime drama, Show Them No Mercy. It's also presented in the full screen format (1.33:1). It stars Tyrone Power & Susan Hayward; the supporting cast includes: Hugh Marlowe, Dean Jagger, Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction) & Jack Elam. Elam's role was one of his biggest in the early part of his career.
Rawhide takes place almost entirely at a stagecoach station.
Sam Todd (Edgar Buchanan) is the stationmaster & Tom Owens (Tyrone Power) is his young assistant. Vinnie Holt (Susan Hayward) arrives on the stage with her baby niece. Because there's an outlaw gang on the loose Holt & the baby are forced off the stage remaining at the station. Zimmerman (Hugh Marlowe) arrives posing as a sheriff on the prowl for the gang. In truth, he's the leader of the outlaw gang; they take over the station, killing Todd, to wait for the next stage that has a large gold shipment. Zimmerman thinks that Owens & Holt are married so he spares them & the child. The scenes are tense, in particular the ones where Tevis (Jack Elam) is constantly being out of control & blood thirsty.
Bonus features include ""Susan Hayward: Hollywood's Straight Shooter"" & ""Shoot It in Lone Pine!"" among others.

Garden of Evil was released in 1954. It's in color, directed by Henry Hathaway. It's presented in the widescreen format (2.55:1). It stars Gary Cooper & Susan Hayward; the supporting cast includes Richard Widmark, Hugh Marlowe, Cameron Mitchell, Rita Moreno & Victor Manuel Mendoza. Garden of Evil is the most action packed of the three movies & is the widest in scope in the amount of territory it covers. Much of the dialog is ambiguous: It's more in what they don't say or hint at.
Hooker (Gary Cooper), Fiske (Richard Widmark) & Daly (Cameron Mitchell) are three cowboys who get stranded in Mexico because the steamship they were on needs repairs. They get hired by Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward) at $2,000 apiece to rescue her husband who's trapped in a gold mine. Vicente (Victor Manuel Mendoza), a Mexican, also gets hired to accompany them. She leads them to a remote location where her husband, John Fuller (Hugh Marlowe), has been. Along the way the band of men realize that they are going to have to deal with the Apache before they can return to Puerto Miguel. There is much distrust between the characters; Daly, in particular, is troublesome & headstrong. Though Garden of Evil is a good western, it's the weakest of the three.
Bonus features include ""Travels of a Gunslinger: The Making of the Garden of Evil"", ""Henry Hathaway: When the Going Gets Tough..."" among others.",1220054400,,4467,4.7317073170731705

Having enjoyed Westerns for some time, growing up in the 50's and 60s it was a Smorgasbord at the movies and on TV. Today the Westerns are few and far between and even on cable TV there are only a couple of networks that televise them. Any fan of this genre should definitely add this three movie set to their Western collection. This set can't be found just anywhere, and not even Netflix rents these movies. This set would be a good deal at $19.99 and it was a bargain at $14.99. I highly recommend this set at Amazon for the amazing steal of $10.99, and you won't find it cheaper if you can even find it.

3363197,5,B0014BQR1A,"Fox Western Classics offer three major, but rarely televised, westerns from the early 1950s.  A real treat, and the best of the three in my opinion, is the ""Garden of Evil"". This is a really fun adventure/western that has Gary Cooper offering lines like ""let's ride!"" and this retort to Susan Hayward's comment about Richard Widmark staying behind to take on the Indians alone; ""Somebody always stays and get's it done.""  I am not a Cooper fan but after seeing him in this film, I better understand his appeal. The source material for the disc is excellent and the widescreen color presentation of some very exotic Mexican locales is worth the price of the dvd.  This film also has a musical score by Bernard Herrmann.

""Rawhide"", directed by Henry Hathaway (as was Garden of Evil)features Tyrone Power and, again, Susan Hayward in a black and white western that is also quite well done.  The dvd presentation is excellent.

Gregory Peck ""stretches"" as an actor by playing a semi-bad guy (complete with a villian's mustache) in ""The Gunfighter"".  Another good western character study and another excellent dvd presentation.

Rawhide has Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward trapped by killers at a stagecoach station. The insanity of both Hugh Marlowe (underrated) and Jack Elam makes it look as though the whole world is in chaos, light years away from unity or peace.

3363207,5,B0014BQR1A,"1954's GARDEN OF EVIL is a Western rich with characterization that seems stereotypical on the surface, but on analysis, runs much deeper. Susan Hayward (an enigmatic heroine) hires a group of stranded travelers in a Mexican waterfront town to follow her to a remote mine where her husband is trapped. The adventurous group is comprised of Gary Cooper (the upright, moralistic hero), Richard Widmark (a cynical witticism spouting gambler), Victor Manuel Mendoza (the good-natured Mexican guide) and Cameron Mitchell (the back-shooting kid gunslinger). They must traverse perilous and dangerous Indian territory to get to the mine, but their motives are unclear. Is it the trapped man, the lure of gold or the subdued sexual attraction that Hayward exudes that drives them? The narrative is a study of personalities in conflict, their motivations, loyalties, cowardice and heroism. Richard Widmark's character comes off as the most interesting. He lingers in the viewer's mind long after the film is over and the question is raised - which is the more honorable: the moralistic hero or the dubiously elegant yet noble rogue? Henry Hathaway is a director known for atmosphere, character and authentic locations. He combines mood and action. This film has all those elements. It is beautifully photographed, yet the picturesque landscapes are juxtaposed with disturbingly photographed death scenes, menacing ever-lurking Indians (always photographed from a distance) and even mysterious looking set designs. The church bell tower sprouting up from the dried lava is all that remains of the town outside the mine and is symbolically ominous in appearance. Frank Fenton's screenplay is filled with vague dialog and only adds to the total feeling of uneasiness that permeates this film. Bernard Herrmann's score accentuates the moodiness of this haunting adventure tale, itself also vague and non-specific. It is very untypical of the Hollywood Western. He achieved a recurrent sense of ominous fate throughout this entire film without the score ever entering into the psychological realm. This is by no means a minor score by Herrmann and I rank this as one of his great scores. GARDEN OF EVIL under Henry Hathaway's direction intelligently yet emotionally integrates the psychological aspects of his characters and even the threatening locale into the action elements found in the standard Western genre to create an unnerving and very thought provoking experience.

1950's THE GUNFIGHTER directed by Henry King is a great character study of the larger than life notion of the hired gunman. Gregory Peck's performance breaks down the mythology of the Western gunman and makes him a real a man who had hopes and aspirations and saw those dreams slip through his fingers and blow away like tumbleweed. The script by William Bowers, William Sellers, Andr De Toth and Nunnally Johnson develop a familiar theme that is so central to many Westerns since. The focus is on the one way of life that has been outlived by time, the collapse of open space and the indistinct progress of civilization. And if that way of life has been characterized by human failures and transgressions, is redemption through a return to a conventional life possible? Alfred Newman's score is very thought provoking and subtle and is a important enhancement to this central theme. THE GUNFIGHTER also has a strong cast that strengthens the narrative with the likes of Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel, Kenneth Tobey, Ellen Corby, Helen Westcott and Alan Hale Jr.

1951's RAWHIDE also directed by Henry Hathaway is a solid entry in the Western genre strong on character motivations and building suspense as outlaws hold citizens captive in a stagecoach station. It has a superlative cast including Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Dean Jagger, Jack Elam, Edgar Buchanan, Hugh Marlowe, Kenneth Tobey and George Tobias. Thomas Little and Stuart A. Reiss designed the primary sets with art designs by Lyle Wheeler and George W. Davis and great camera work by cinematographer Milton Krasner all essential to the central story. Composers Sol Kaplan and Lionel Newman turned in an interesting score.",1207008000,,4163,5.268072289156627
3363208,5,B0014BQR1A,"Three long overdue for DVD Westerns are together in one collection. Each of these movies are great individually, but together, makes this a must-have Western film. Here are the three films -

Rawhide - Rawhide deserves not only a DVD release, but recognition as one of the greatest Westerns ever. Taut, masterful direction by the great Henry Hathaway, and excellent perfomances by everyone makes this a must have film for anyone who loves the Western genre.

Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward are trapped at a stage way station by a gang of desperate criminals. Surprises and tragedy unfold as Power, Hayward, and Hayward's baby try to survive and outwit the criminals.

There are scenes in this film that are so tense that even today's hardened, jaded moviegoers will appreciate. This was not a film with larger than life heroes or cardboard cutout villains, but real people well portrayed with great lines from a magnificent script.

The Gunfighter - Gregory Peck, with his natural, spare acting style, and his folksy, plain demeanor, was a natural for Westerns, and his greatness in this genre was never more evident in this 1950 film, which was one of the earlier psychological Westerns.

Peck plays Jimmie Ringo, the most notorious gunfighter in the West, is running from the brothers of a man he killed. He shows up in a town where his ex-wife lives with their young son. Ringo holds up in the town saloon as a favor to the town marshal, who an old friend, while he waits for an opportunity to see his wife.

Meanwhile, the town is taken over with the nervous enthusiasm of people wanting to see a celebrity, a shootout, or a dead celebrity. At the same time, a young punk, would-be gunfighter has heard that Ringo is in town, and is itching to make his reputation off of killing Ringo.

Everyone delivers excellent performances, and the movie has a lot to say about voyeurism, celebrity, longing, and regret. This is a fantastic movie, and without question, one of the best Westerns ever made.

Garden of Evil - This great Western was never even released on VHS, much less video, which is a shame since it had great performance from two great Western actors, Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark. Cooper, Widmark, and two other soldiers of fortune, played by Cameron Mitchell and Victor Manuel Mendoza, arrive in Mexico having responded to an add to make lots of money. They are greeted by Susan Hayward, who takes them on a perilous journey to rescue her husband, who has been injured in a mining accident. If the journey and the rescue weren't hard enough, the location of the mine in in Indian territory. Soon, alliances are made, broken, and remade, and emotions, greed, and violence ensues.

This film may be regarded as the least of the three by some, but it has terrific acting by all, and is a wonderful showcase of Cooper beginning the twilight phase of his magnificent career, where he tended to play veteran loners who find that they still have lots to live for, and who usually finds love and renewed courage along the way.

3363211,4,B0014BQR1A,"Is there any place, any retreat, any home of retirement, that an inevitably tiring gunman can move on to?

This predicament is best conveyed, explored and given its full tragic weight in Henry King's 'The Gunfighter.'

Ringo (Gregory Peck), wearing his reputation as the fastest gun in the south-west territories like a heavy load, enters each bar warily when he needs a quiet drink, knowing full well the reaction--fear, respect, perhaps admiration, and certainly the intervention in some form or other of a young upstart with itchy gun-fingers.

Although Ringo, guilty for previous sins, tries to refrain and to avoid the shoot-out... But he is always compelled to eliminate the worthless maladjusted gunmen, wishful for a big name...

The pattern is set early on when Peck has to shoot a boy (Richard Jaecke1) in self-defense. And so a feud begins--you feel it's only one of many--with the three brothers of the boy (Alan Hale Jr., David Clarke and John Pickard) hell-bent for revenge...

Peck deals with this situation, at least for the moment, sighs and then moves on to a place that passes for home... Here is his wife (Helen Westcott) and his son, who won't, however, be providing him with a welcome since in the eight years that husband and family have been apart the wife has been trying to build a life of their own... Here also is a sheriff (Millard Mitchell) formerly engaged in Peck's outlaw activities, but now reformed, and an old girl friend (Jean Parker) ready to he1p him in anything that concerns him most... His actual concern is reconciliation with his wife and a new life together... There is a tentative rapprochement but, of course, there is another of those young contender interventions, this time in the person of Skip Homeier...

Henry King draws up carefully the ultimate end of the 'top gun of the West.' His film is an inclination towards a classical tragedy, destined to be destroyed inevitably... Peck strikes the right note from his first edgy entry... He wants to shake off his past... He is disgusted to kill in order to survive... He is aimless for a change, sick with death and glory, showing tiredness of killing, conscious to a tragic fate one day...

Peck is superb in his brief and nervy reunion with his small son, impressed like the rest of the local kids by the fact that Jimmy Ringo, the gunfighter, is in town...

""The Gunfighter"", keen and penetrating, explosive and tense, is beautifully acted, tautly directed and superbly photographed by Arthur Miller in black-and-white...",1163030400,,2524,4.894613583138173

Along the dusty trail, he stops to rest and quench his thirst at a saloon, where he is soon recognized by the locals.

Word gets out and Peck is soon stalked by Jaeckel's three brothers.
Peck slows the brothers down by scaring off their horses on the route to Cayenne.  This gives him a small window of opportunity to convince his wife to re-establish the family.  He arrives in town and learns that the town marshall is none other than his old partner Mark Strett played by a sympathetic Millard Mitchell.

PECK IS AN AGING GUNMAN WHO REGRETS HIS PAST AND IS PUSHING TOWARD A FUTURE THAT HE HOPES WILL INCLUDE HIS WIFE AND SON.  HIS WIFE IS A SCHOOL MARM WHO GOES BY AN ALIAS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AND THE BOY DOESNT KNOW THAT THE CELEBRATED OUTLAW IS DEAR OL, DAD. BUT AS PECKS CHARACTER ATTEMPTS TO ARRANGE A FAMILY REUNION, THE FAMILY OF A MAN PECK WAS FORCED TO KILL IS HOT ON HIS TRAIL. THEREIN LIES THE KIND OF SIMPLISTIC PLOT THAT GREAT WESTERNS ARE KNOWN FOR.
AUDIENCES IN 1950 DIDNT CARE FOR PECK'S MUSTASHE AND THE FILM WAS NOT OVER PATRONIZED.
THIS MOVIE IS FOR THE INTELLIGENT, THINKING VIEWER WHO IS MORE INTO THE CHARACTERS THAN THE ACTION.

THE CHARACTER OF MARSHAL MARK STRETT IS EFFECTIVELY PORTRAYED AND THE DIALOGUE IS QUALITY AND GENUINE.
THIS IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE OF THE OFFERINGS BY GREG PECK, AND GIVEN THE OVERALL QUALITY OF HIS WORK I THINK THAT SAYS A LOT.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS WAS ALSO PECKS FAVORITE SELF WORK AS WELL.
IN THE FINALLY PECK'S GUNMAN IS AMBUSHED BY A YOUNG PUNK LOOKING TO CASH IN ON THE VETERAN'S FAME. THE MARSHAL WANTS TO SEE THE BOY HANG BUT THE DYING GUNFIGHTERS LAST REQUEST IS TO LET THE KID GO ON BEING A ""BIG TOUGH GUNNEY"" SO THAT THE MISCREANT CAN LIVE A LIFE OF PAIN AND MISERY AWAITING HIS OWN UNTIMELY END.
THIS LITTLE FILM ADEQUATELY TELLS THE STORY THAT SO MANY OTHERS ATTEMPT TO BUT DONT QUITE GET IT DONE. AT ANY RATE 'THE GUNFIGHTER' IS AN ENTERTAINING PLAY THAT UNFORTUANTELY WAS FAR AHEAD OF ITS TIME.",1061683200,,1801,4.357142857142857
3363216,5,B0014BQR1A,"Wow.  One of the best westerns I've ever seen, that's for sure.  Everything about this film is spot-on perfect, from the cinematography and acting to the costuming, sound, blocking and general attention to detail... not to mention the script!  Gregory Peck stars as Jimmy Ringo, the fastest gun in the West, now turning to middle age, and ready to give up the life of a violent roustabout.  The trouble is, of course, that everywhere he goes, people know and fear him, and every would-be badman in the territory wants to knock him down a peg or two.  It's an old story, repeated in numerous pulps, films, dime novels and comicbooks over the years, but probably never as tersely and tensely as here.  Honestly, there's not a false or flat moment in this film; director Henry King delivers a mournful masterpiece, and Peck is stunning in his role as a weatherbeaten, tired old gunny who'd gladly chuck it all in, if it weren't for the burdensome reputation he'd spent his entire youth building.  Fans of the ""Lonesome Dove"" series should recognize the imprint of Jimmy Ringo, and his erstwhile pal, now the town marshall,  Mark Strett (played perfectly by Millard Mitchell), two old-timers who know that the hard life isn't really as glamourous as most folks think.  Highly recommended.",1055721600,,1284,4.853211009174312
3363217,5,B0014BQR1A,"This could be the best western I have ever seen. Mostly because of its noir elements and absolutely standout performances, especially by Gregory Peck as the haunted gunfighter trying to leave his past behind, and by Millard Mitchell as his old partner-in-crime-turned-sheriff. I knew immediately upon watching this for the first time tonight that this was not your typical western. It quietly conveys doom almost from the beginning. I sensed a bleak outlook for Peck's character, Jimmy Ringo, from the start, and the movie conveys this mood very subtly throughout, building to the inevitable conclusion in understated and graceful tones.

That said, this movie has several very brief but very humorous moments that had me laughing outright because they caught me completely off guard. These humorous snippets will pass you by completely if you're not watching closely. And even if you are watching closely, they are so understated that you still could miss them. I'll give you a few of these scenes to watch for: When the old man comes in to talk to the sheriff (while the sheriff is talking to Ringo) to tell him someone set his house on fire (spot-on comedic timing by all concerned), when the kid who wants to gun down Ringo comes in for a haircut, makes boasts, then leaves. After he leaves, one of the men in the shop makes a comment (again, perfect timing). There's about three more that I noticed, but there could be more. As I said, it flies by so naturally, I'm guessing most people wouldn't notice it. Very subtle humor.

But this film is a strange sort of tragedy first and foremost, and the noirish element is definitely prominent throughout. It's amazing to me that all the actors' performances are toned down so far that they hardly move at times, and yet these performances are some of the most powerful I've ever seen. Director Henry King should have gotten an award for creating this masterpiece of understatement. If you're a fan of westerns or noir, you can't go wrong. A unique classic.",1010620800,,2006,4.828488372093023
3363218,5,B0014BQR1A,"The Gunfighter is not your usual western gunslinger film.  It is a look at the current ""top gun"" and how he feels to be in everyone's gunsights.  He's tired and wants to leave the limelight and head west to California wioth his family and start over again where he is unknown.  But that is not how it works out. ....
The entire cast is superb, from the bartender who is both in awe and respectful of Peck's charecter. ....
Millard Mitchell is excellent as a gunfighter who has managed to outlive his past.  He has been there and successfully gotten out of the limelight still intact.  Mitchell's treatment of the new ""top gun"" at the conclusion of the film is outstanding.
This is a fine movie that has stood the test of time. The cast is excellent and it has a stamp of reality to it.  I recommend it to anyone.",997142400,,812,4.344370860927152
3363219,4,B0014BQR1A,"Dylan sang these words in a 1986 song:
Well, there was this movie I seen one time,
 About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
 He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
 The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
 Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
 as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.
 Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,
 I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.

 and later in this very long song:
 Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
 Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind.
 He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about
 But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line.
 and even later:
 There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.
 I don't remember who I was or where I was bound.
 All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
 Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.

 The Gunfighter is for real. It's kind of a noir Western, if that's possible. I have no idea how Peck conveys so much with that nearly immobile face of his, but he does-- and never to better effect than in The Gunfighter.",987552000,,1374,3.85663082437276
