The whole film including the acting is very, very dull.

The nanny was really the only interesting person, and she is only in a few scenes.",1316390400,,168,4.566666666666666
8337462,2,B001R60EQ6,"Watched the movie tru out. The first hour was a bit boaring and the end was well the father kidnapped his own daughter after he had kidnapped another little girl. He was trying to cover up the first little girls disappearence and murder.
Not the best but ok...",1258156800,,260,4.4375
8337463,3,B001R60EQ6,"My rating of three stars places this film in the spectrum of indie suspense/thrillers. It falls in the middle of that limited range. If all films were considered, this one would hardly make that high a grade.

A lot of this low budget indie film comes off as episodic and amateurish. Some of the scenes involving minor characters look like a videotaped version of a college drama class rehearsal. What's more, the plot is an uneasy mix of the supernatural Grudge and a British Dirty Harry.

However the lead actor, Steven Elliott, does a good job with the material he's given. I found myself more absorbed whenever he was on-screen, which is much of the time. He has a dark charisma and might be expected to make the crossover to star in polished, professional films in the near future. So you can look for him. And you could do worse than take a look at this film.",1246752000,,865,4.503184713375796
