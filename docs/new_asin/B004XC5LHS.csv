4493833,5,B004XC5LHS,"As far as I know Angel Beats! is definitely one of the best anime that came out last year. Jun Maeda, the creator of AIR, Kanon and Clannad joined forces with P.A. Works to bring this incredibly beautiful story.

As a matter of fact, Maeda himself seems to have had a lot of difficulties during the production of this series, partly because he was originally a game designer and not supposed to be much familiar with the production process of  TV anime series. Even so, moving story,  vivid characters, unique and subtle backdrop as well as stylish music still made this series the best of its kind.

On the other hand, I guess there is  one thing that everyone could agree on: This series was too short and not a few things have been left unexplained. So, I hope at least Section23 Films won't forget to include the supplemental episode which is currently only available on the last volume of Japanese Blu-ray/DVD.",1304294400,,915,4.6234567901234565

4493849,5,B004XC5LHS,"At first, Angel Beats seems like a casual, fun anime with slap stick humor without much of a hint to the contrary. In time, this seemingly casual anime segues into a much more emotional story that is topped with a crescendo of an ending. All of this with some amazing and memorable music. I'll avoid saying any more so as to avoid spoilers, but I definitely recommend Angel Beats.",1479600000,,380,4.521739130434782

That being said I find it really sad SPOILER ALERT they all were great characters and it's great they found peace with their lives and deaths. For me what's sad is they all became great friends and for some more than that, but when they moved on you don't know if they all will meet each other again and even if they do they won't know their friendships.

Some people look past it due to negative critic reviews but it hits so many levels from hilarious to heatwrenching to even heartwarming.

Yuri tells him that she leads the Shinda Sekai Sensen (Afterlife Battlefront) and wages war against a girl named Tenshi. Unable to believe Yuri's claims that Tenshi is evil, Otonashi attempts to speak with her, but the encounter doesn't go as he intended.

4493893,5,B004XC5LHS,Wanted a good animae to watch but didn't want to get into something with a zillion videos to watch. This is perfect. The story line has so many levels and it's deep but not too deep. There is some blood & gore (less than whats on cable these days) but I would certainly let my 13 year old daughter watch if she wanted. Great for a day binge session or watch over a few days.,1469404800,,374,4.0
4493894,4,B004XC5LHS,"I haven't watched anime in a long time. My friend said I should check this one out since it's only 13 episodes and it's a tearjerker. For whatever reason, I like shows that make me cry, so I went for it.

This show was like the epitome of anime. It was a hodgepodge of many anime elements rolled into one - random humor, all the tropes, sad stories, and random music performances in a school. Except, y'know, they're all not really in school. It's a bizarre sci-fi slice of life humor anime. I don't know how else to explain it. The music was pretty great, though. I'd totally be a Garudemo fan. A warning: I feel like a lot of the characters should've gotten more story time. There were a lot of unanswered questions for me, but the end was okay...I guess.

Like I mentioned, it's only 13 episodes. It's worth adding to your list of anime to watch.",1469318400,,849,4.333333333333333

Yeah, that's how I felt after watching Angel Beats.  I just don't know where to begin reviewing this fantastic series, so here is my suggestion.  Don't bother reading the synopsis, just start watching, there's more than enough 5 star reviews to warrant a blind ""dive-in"" and that's pretty how I got into it.

4493913,4,B004XC5LHS,"I respect quality animation and Japanese anime. With that being said, I will keep this review short and simple.

This anime series has action, adventure, drama, comedy, and spiritual fantacy. It has a beautiful soundtrack and a live feature anime band! Seriously! I am a drummer...and the music animation performance is spectacular! I am not joking. I love the music in the series.

Friendship goes a long way here. This story will bend and twist your heart. At first...the plot is confusing and funny. Then the story plot thickens and character development progresses. The story will drive you into the lives lost of the lead protagonists. Unfortunately, some past history of important characters are left out, making the series feel incomplete. The series will not leave you hanging on a wire....so to speak.

I really love the characters, artwork, and music. The show had action (though not that much), comedy, drama (it gets more serious towards the middle/end), and just a hint of romance.

1st, for some unknown reason it doesn't include the alternate ending (less then 9 minutes long!) that was in the Japanese Blu-Ray - VERY disappointing

As a Vietnam Veteran and now a Senior Citizen Otaku, I know those feelings all to well. Excellent Story line and good character development, it gives you an emotional rapport to most characters besides the main Male and the two Female leads. I agree with other reviewers that it could have been extended for more episodes to understand more back stories of other characters. I would put this in my ""favorites category"" like ""Clannad"" and ""Clannad After Story"".

4493976,3,B004XC5LHS,"A show with massive amounts of potential....that never quite took off for me. For me, the biggest problem with Angel Beats! was that we are thrown right into the middle of the story (not usually a bad thing) but given a half-assed explanation of what is going on that we feel just as strong-armed into joining the SSS as the main character was. And rather than elaborate on what is going on, where we are, and why we're fighting ""Angel"", the series just expects us to go ahead with it and join the fight. And the ending (which most will tell you is the saddest thing ever) not only failed to garner any emotion from me because I honestly only cared about one character in the entire show, but the final twist at the end, chronologically speaking, made no freakin' sense. People treat this show as though it deserves to be on the same pedestal as Clannad: AS or Anohana and I suppose if you ignore the glaring issues with the plot, sure, maybe it is. But with too diverse of a cast that we hardly get to know and a plot that almost makes no sense, this show would almost be a non-recommendation for me. The only saving grace this series had were the few episodes dedicated solely to a single character, their backstories, and the trials they undertake in an effort to ""move on"". If nothing else, those few gems hidden in this mess are, at the very least, worth a stream if you aren't willing to buy this outright.",1442880000,,1412,4.393129770992366

I would classify this as a drama.  Yes, there are some bits of comedy to break up the drama at times.  But there is a really deep plot here that develops as the series goes on.  And as many other people have said, you really develop an attachment to the characters.  And the music is really awesome.  The opening and closing songs and the insert songs are all written specifically for the show and the music and lyrics fit perfectly.  Im not going to give any spoilers at all.  But I highly recommend this show.  It is definitely one for the collection as I will be going back to watch it again.

As with almost everyone else, my only complaint is that it is entirely too short.  But they really do pack a lot in this series without making it feel like it is cut off.",1439856000,,1015,4.086294416243655

4493989,5,B004XC5LHS,"I hesitated for a long time before actually purchasing this anime. Based on the description I figured it was more of a silly show that I didn't really want to spend the money on. BUT I WAS SO WRONG!!!!

Do not let the description or the fact there is only 13 episodes make you not get this. The anime starts with the premise that these kids have died and now must fight the Angel to prevent her from obliterating them, but that is not the only story arc and in fact there is so much more to this anime than meets the eye.

It has a lot of humor and I found myself laughing out loud throughout each episode, but it is so perfectly mixed with the serious aspects of these characters facing their death and coming to terms with their lives before dying. Towards the end I found my self tearing up at the more tender and touching moments and by the final episode I was a complete mess. It was beautiful and captivating from start to finish.

The only downside to this anime is the fact that it isn't longer, I would have loved to have gotten the chance to learn the backstory of all the characters because even though there is a pretty big cast I felt interested in all of them and wanting to know more!

Overall this anime has something for everyone, comedy, action, drama, great music, great characters, and a perfectly heartbreaking ending that will almost certainly have you in tears.",1438992000,5,1384,4.373540856031128

I won't spoil much, as it's easy to do for reviews of this, but take a young man with no memory, place in a school that seems very bizzare, surround him with quirky but original characters and you just barely scratch what makes this show amazing. A story that as the plot goes along and truth gets revealed will make anyone with a heartbeat feel emotionally driven to cry. At the same time the comedy that is placed in this show makes for tears of joy as well. At 13 episodes, including the ova, it has just the right amount of necessary time to flesh out each character,  tell the heartwarming stories for them and show some amazing animation all throughout.

4494056,3,B004XC5LHS,"Where to begin. Angel Beats is an anime I watched because it was recommended for fans of Haibane Renmei. Was that a good recommendation? No, but it wasn't a terrible one either.
  Angel Beats is about a bunch of kids who have lead unfair and unhappy lives until their early deaths, and who now refuse to let go of their anger with God, who let them endure such hardships. It sounds intriguing, but a few of their life stories seemed so unlikely and rare that I wondered who would be able to relate to them, and sometimes it seemed like they were revealed too suddenly in-between the laughs. However, I was moved by some of their stories and struggles. Some moments were beautiful, and the ending was absolutely gorgeous in every way.
  The solution to their problems is allowing them to experience in the present, in-between life what they wanted to experience in their past lives, and this helps them realize that life is good and that it is better to move on. It's not a bad thought at all, that life can get better and that holding on to the past isn't worth it. I just didn't feel that it was executed in the best way. This series wasn't what it could have been.
  All of the music is great. It has a really interesting (and sometimes electronic) sound; sometimes emotional, often exciting and engaging. The credits song, ""Brave Song,"" is really beautiful, as is ""My Most Precious Treasure.""
  All of the characters are really likeable. And the animation is great; there is nothing awkward about it.
  I didn't find the action sequences to be all that mesmerizing but one thing that is true about this series is that it is hilarious. I was laughing very hard at some of it.
  Others have complained that they felt the show was rushed; I only ever felt that once, and that was in episode 6 when an extremely little-known characters backstory is revealed in an explosion of affected emotion. Other than that, I thought the pace was perfect and Im very glad there were no more episodes; I think it would have been more difficult for me to finish the series if it were longer.
  All in all, this is a solid three-star anime. It is not really spectacular but it does deserve a chance.",1429574400,2,2183,4.50761421319797
4494057,5,B004XC5LHS,You will get the feels. Such an amazing anime. I have watched it many times. WARNING: MAY EVEN MAKE MEN CRY.. Lol,1428969600,,113,4.181818181818182
4494058,4,B004XC5LHS,This anime is anything but predictable. The characters are wacky and endearing. Enemies become allies so you never know who to cheer for and you never know what crazy plan the students will come up with.,1428710400,,203,4.666666666666667
4494059,5,B004XC5LHS,"A recently developed theory: (Let's see if someone can disprove this one)

One of the plot holes in Angel Beats! is how Angel (Kanade) was in ""purgetory"" before otonashi, fighting Yuri and the other members of SSS for some time before otonashi ""appeared"" in the purgatory. He clearly has been dead before Angel in the real world.  Some people justify this fact by saying that the time pacing may be different in the ""purgatory"". But there were some other things that didn't make sense in the first place. For example Otonashi's Amnesia. He didn't die because of a Head injury or something. There was no evidence of a Head injury like dizziness or blood coming out of his head etc. after the train crash. He died because of internal bleeding and lack of food and water.
At the end Yuri met the ""shadow programmer"" who claimed he was there from the beginning to prevent the purgatory from crashing. He also tells her this about the original programmer:

""During his time in the Afterlife School, he fell in love with an unnamed girl who disappeared when her regret was fulfilled. Unwilling or unable to accept this, he decided to wait for her to return, however, many years passed and he grewmad with waiting, eventually programming himself to become an NPC""
The current programmer also tells Yuri that the original programmer of the angel player is ""still there to this day"". We also know that the current programmer isn't the original because when Yuri asked the programmer about the original one he said ""Beats me, it's not like I invented it""

If you now take a close look at the scene when Otonashi wakes up in the purgatory he has the same clothing as other people that woke up as NPC's. Also remember what the programmer said:"" he grew mad with waiting, eventually programming himself to become an NPC"" and that ""he is still there to this day"". Furthermore when Takamatsu turned into an NPC he lost his memories as Otonashi did and also wears these ""NPC clothing"". As previously stated Otonashi didn't die because of a head injury. So the only explanation is that he was an NPC. You might have already noticed where this is heading to. Yes, this theorie suggests that Otonashi was the original programmer.

This would also mean that angel wasn't in purgatory before Otonashi which is why the end would make sense again.
However this doesn't explain why he reverted from beeing an NPC during the battle between Yuri and Angel (Kanade) at the very beginning. So here is what this theory proposes:
The current programmer ( or shadow programmer) told Yuri that he activated after Yuri began to display her powerful feeling of love to her comrades in the battlefront. The shadow programmer refers to love as a ""bug in the system"". This could explain why Otonashi, the original programmer, awaked from his NPC state as a way to fix the system. The fact that he was an NPC meant that he had amnesia. Therefore he wasn't able to remember his past life or the fact that he was the original programmer.
The only reason he remembered his past life was due to the combination of hypnosis and listening to his own heart beat.
.
My personal adding to this theorie:
The quote I mentioned before which includes what the shadow programmer told Yuri about the original programmer also fits very well to the the situation of Otonashi which is shown in the OVA called ""Another epilogue"". ""he is waiting for someone"". Connecting this OVA with the rest of this theorie brings me to the conclusion that the OVA could be an epiolouge but also a prequel. Think about that.

The underlying premise of the story is decidedly strange. As the story unfolds, it begins to make sense. (Maybe the 3rd ep was an aberration or did I miss the point?) Whatever. The characters, the style, the music, all work together well.  The combination of drama, comedy, action, and the emotional rollercoaster of the finish deserve a six. :-)",1420243200,,727,4.792

This anime is HIGHLY recommended for those who wants Action-Adventure, Epic, Drama, Comedy, and Romance. *Sigh* My favorite two characters are Yui and Kanade because they are so ADORABLE! /^w^/ \^w^\ Wow, even the songs from Angel Beats, back in the day when I first watched it, were very ADDICTIVE to listen during those times. Furthermore, if it wasn't for Angel Beats, the I wouldn't be able to listen to the BEST Japanese singer, LiSa, which I sometimes Image her as Yui whenever I listen to her songs. (Call me weird) :p
Mainly, all the songs, from opening to ending (especially the scenes where Iwasawa and Yui play all of their songs), are truly a work of art... :3
I doubt that they are going to make a second season season, but if they do, I'll DEFINITELY look it up in the internet and become its stalker because this ANIME deserves credit! xD

*Spoiler* [Don't read this if you haven't watched this AWESOME ANIME]

Overall, it actually made me cry when Kanade, Otonashi, and Yui disappear with one simple song--a song as to why I love this anime the most. ""Karuta"" is simply a masterpiece with an exuberant feeling of sadness yet peculiar about the ending. Even though this anime is fiction and all, I just hope Kanade and Otonashi end up together, and plan a wedding, along with the Crew. In addition to the wedding, Yui could sing on the chapel while Kanade and Otonashi make their vows and all--this is my opinion after all.... :)",1411516800,,1477,4.608365019011407

The action is good, however, it is not the main focus of the show.  The series is short, but every episode is as good as it could possibly be.  Angel Beats takes the best aspects of the drama, comedy, and action genres and rolls them into one superior product.

4494149,5,B004XC5LHS,"If I could write a novel about how this changed my life, I would post it here for  you all to read so I can convince you to purchase this anime.

I haven't seen such an emotional masterpiece in quite some time - in reference to anime. The main character is very likable and realistic too; not the typical pansies we get for MCs nowadays.

I can't go into too much detail, because you really need to watch this; it's about kids who had unfair lives, and when they died, they ended up in a type of purgatory or transitional afterlife to help them move on and ""graduate"" from their youth, and accept their fate.

Every episode made me tear up, and got me heavily engrossed in the story and emotions being conveyed. This is a 13 episode series, with an additional OVA that is more of a comical relief - because the ending of the series was so perfect and beautiful. Very rarely can I say an animation has been stellar throughout every episode, let alone ever saying the ending was perfect and matched up with the story/theme.

Every scenario was real, and very easy to relate to, and get attached to. The characters were very well thought out; each having their own identity and personality that was not only identifiable, but likable and realistic, too.

Never have I recommended an anime so heavily as I do this one to you. I heard marvelous things about this show for about three years now, and I don't know why it took me so long to check it out and invest in it. It's left my heart aching, my mind racing and wishing for more, and it has left me with a new resolve for life. You never know how meaningful your life is until it's gone, so watch this show and catch a glimpse of how humanity should act - with concern and love for others.

This is not a violent or gory anime, and it does NOT contain fanservice or filler episodes. Each ep divulges new feelings for the characters and the world they are in, and keeps you dying for more - without heavily relying on cliffhangers - it just naturally flows.

The ending may seem rushed to some, but the studio and writers did a fantastic job squeezing it into a one cour series. I would have liked a two-cour series, but I'm pretty sure it's better with less episodes. My reasons being Elfen Lied and Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. The three best anime in terms of an emotionally scarring story and animation (in the best way possible, of course).",1411171200,2,2389,4.376975169300226

4494167,5,B004XC5LHS,"One of my favorite series periods, going beyond just anime.  It really is enjoyable, and it does a good job of mixing up various elements.  There are some extremely hilarious moments, some incredibly serious ones, and plenty of affectionate ones.  Jaded audiences used to the misery of tv in the U.S. (Game of Thrones being a perfect example) may find it corny, but it's a really nice change of pace.

The only negative criticism I have of the series is that it's too short.  There was enough of a world, and content within it for them to have made a second season if they really wanted.  As such the final storyline feels a bit sudden and it's resolution rushed.  A very minor gripe though.

If you're unfamiliar with anime it's a good series to start with as you don't have to be an anime junkie, or knowledgeable about Japanese culture to appreciate the story.",1406764800,,863,4.558441558441558
4494168,5,B004XC5LHS,"This is easily among the best of its genre, packed with a welcomingly fresh and original story, great characters with whom many can relate, and an amazingly beautiful soundtrack. I have watched a lot of anime in my time and few have managed to move me as much as this one did. As the anime's entire premise revolves around tragic stories of students who suffered from the terrible misfortunes of an unjust world, it is perfectly designed to pull on your heartstrings relentlessly and executes this in an equally perfect manner. The mix of humor and action with the drama is done flawlessly, never once seeming out of place or as if it was trying too hard.

For those who are overly concerned about art style, this anime does not disappoint. It is clean and void of unnecessary fan service. Large iconic anime female eyes abound, as if that were anything to worry about.

As I prefer to watch anime with Japanese voices and English subtitles, I cannot comment on the English dubbed version. That said, the voice acting is superb. You might get a few clich lines here and there, but otherwise the dialogue is compelling and helps to drive the story forward. Hardly do the characters ever say anything wasted, especially considering that the series is only 13 episodes long and would not have any room for it anyways.

If you are a guy watching this, be prepared to set aside your man card for a while. Your eyes will be sweating whether you want them to or not. If the character stories do not do it for you, then the music will. It is okay though - you can find a wall to punch later to regain your manliness.

Overall, I highly recommend this series. Just be sure to have a box of tissues on hand. I ended up rolling right into Clannad afterwards - eyes felt a little dehydrated after all that sweating, but it was worth it.",1405814400,,1824,4.484939759036145
4494169,3,B004XC5LHS,"I watched a lot of anime in high school and early college. A lot. I really ate it all up. It was a new thing for me and I thought it was so much better than anything I'd seen domestically. Eventually I got jaded and now I feel that there are some good ones here and there, with most anime being pretty much the same. Anime tends to have a lot of retold cliches and heavy-handed drama.
That said, I would've liked this in my anime mania days, but now I find it pretty average. There's a lot of weak plot points to ignore, and the only thing I really liked was the occasional good joke. I don't want to completely troll this review because a lot of people seem to like it, but honestly I would've been fine if I never saw this. At least it was only 13 episodes.

4494175,5,B004XC5LHS,I love this anime. It has a certain charm to it that seems to tug at the emotional heart strings. The characters are full of personality and life.

4494197,5,B004XC5LHS,"Impressive visuals, deep story telling, a fun cast of characters. I have to admit Angels Beats has yet again proven itself well beyond it's prodisessors like Clannad and Air tv. The story is down right tragically beautiful and it all leads up to one emotional joyride. The moral of the theme is moving forward and acceptance most like Jun Maeda's Clannad which is also one that cannot be missed especially if your an Angel Beats fan. It's full of tons of cool musical performances from the hit fiction band girls dead monster , while on the other hand it's an action packed powerhouse. To many one who enjoys deep storytelling and strong moralities I highly recommend Angel Beats to be added to your anime collection. As it gives you the lovely bones feeling, your breathe will be taken away by just how powerful these characters can be. As the story not only touches your heart but your soul as well. It's very heart warming and very keen on the topic of moving forward. The story alone is strong and with a mix of comedy and action you will not be disappointed by it's dramatic transformation toward the end. This story will enable you to see just how sacred and beautiful the human heart can really be and it refelects everything that represents the ultimate good. The music is fast paced and fun , yet at the sometime it can get somber and emotional. It's an emotional joyride and a very beautiful tale indeed. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 all good kids go to heaven!",1402444800,,1456,4.6038461538461535
4494198,5,B004XC5LHS,"This was a truly lovable anime. It starts out with some absurd and comic things to get you hooked. Then you start to hear some good music and see some neat battles it quietly sprinkles in plot and character development. Next thing you know you can't wait to see what happens next. Not because of the action or comedy or any of the other one elements, but because you have built a deep emotional connection with the show.

From my not so gushy viewpoint, The show has a good flow, and the ending doesn't feel rushed even though there are only 13 episodes. There are several mysteries you can figure out a little bit ahead of time if your paying attention, but it's not so obvious that you see it coming from too far away. Some things did bother me tho. While they explained this world had it's own set of rules, they didn't go into enough details. Also, viewers should be forewarned that this show has a bit of philosophy, and the characters are all Japanese with Buddhism being mentioned in the first few episodes. There is also a running joke with 2 characters one wanting to be called Christ and the other wanting to be called God. Some Christians may find this offensive. One last thing that bothered me was that when people disappeared you had to watch closely. There wasn't an audio or visual cue accenting it.",1400457600,,1315,4.479166666666667

If you only watch the first few episodes, you may find yourself asking 'what's all the hype about?'  I have to say that you absolutely must finish this series in order to enjoy it (and you won't regret the decision to do so).

It swings wildly from comedy, to action to, comedy and then on to drama.  The comedy is light and vibrant, and the action is fetching enough to keep one entertained.  It's the drama where the show truly gets you, however.  Each episode lures you in with a bouquet of life and fun, and then subtly slides a knife between your ribs to tickle your heart.  As strange as that sounds, it's a good feeling.

The ending, above all, is what makes this series.  Down to the wire, the show flirts with disaster and complete calamity...",1400284800,,830,4.48

The beginning was different than other anime's that I had watched before, and the subject is different than any I have seen, but it caught my attention. I watched the entire anime in two days, which isn't too difficult since it is quite short. There were a few things that disappointed me, especially towards the end, but this anime had everything!

The anime was funny (especially TK), sad, action packed, and friendly for everyone. You don't have to worry about who is watching the anime, since it is all clean fun!",1400198400,,686,4.532258064516129
4494202,5,B004XC5LHS,"I remember watching the first episode of this on iTunes one day since there was a promotion and it was free. The first episode was so gripping that I had to watch the rest of the series. But time went by, and my wallet didn't get any fatter over the years, so I've waited about 2 years before finally being able to watch the rest of the series.
And it is seriously the most emotional anime I've seen in a long time! With the beginning so upbeat and happy, the emotional sections really hits you hard. I mean, you expect them since you know that all the kids are already dead, but it was seriously more than I expected! I think I got a little teary at the end.
I bought this ""used"" from Amazon Warehouse Deals, but it was more like new. The plastic wrap wasn't even torn, there was just a dent (not even a crack!) on the case.

4494203,5,B004XC5LHS,"I'll start off by saying one thing, this anime is very short as it only has 13 episodes. With that said, the anime makes use of those 13 episodes very efficiently and leaves you wanting more by the time the 13th episode has finished. Everything in this anime is done very well, from the animation to the soundtrack. Since this is an anime by Key, you know that this anime will tug at your heartstrings, so be prepared for that.

4494257,4,B004XC5LHS,"Honestly, I don't consider ""Angel Beats!"" one of the best anime out there. But that does not mean that it is bad at all, it is quite good in actually. It has outrageous action, over the top comedy, and heartwarming moments as well. I warn you here and now, that this anime needs to be watched until the end to understand why so many have an affinity towards this anime; and I tell you, it won't disappoint you.
Yes, the plot goes off course and does some crazy stuff. But also keep in mind that the ""goofing around"" is part of the plot and is an important key point in the story. (explained in episode 1)
To me this anime is one of the first anime that I watched, it is one of the anime that got me hooked on this media. At that time, I was a newbie in the anime world and this anime made me feel a variety of emotions; from anger, happiness, sadness...it was the perfect entry level anime to watch. And because of that, it helps new comers to be isolate genres that they find more appealing.
Believe me, buying the Blu-ray is worth it. But to me, I have a great lasting 1st impression of this anime, and I don't want to tarnish it by watching it a 3rd time. Since being critical of anime always comes when you watch a good amount of anime of different genres, so I avoid watching anime that hit hard with a feels train or awesomeness mobile more that 2 times; to preserve that lasting impression in my mind.",1391644800,,1408,4.199261992619927

4494279,5,B004XC5LHS,"Angel Beats is unlike any other anime ive explored.
The story revolves around a young group of teens who are in a purgatory like realm where they team up amd create the ""battlefront"" to fight who they believe is their enemy, Angel. The main character is a young man named otonishy (spelling?), but a handful of the characters play a significant role throughout.
For the most part, the series takes on a serious role, afterall the afterlife isn't a breeze for these teens. That being said it appears on the surface that everyone is easygoing and just trying not to get ""obliterated"". There is no fanservice and a small amount of romance. This is an anime thats really designed to make you think, and left me personally feeling grateful that i decided to watch it.
As stated before the series is only 13 episodes long, leaving everyone including myself, desiring more. However, in 13 episodes the producers managed to complete the story, something that a large amount of anime series aren't capable of doing.
If you're into subbed anime then amazon has it for you, however i prefer dubbed anime and there are plenty of sites that provide it.
If you're looking for an anime, whether well-versed or just starting out, Angel Beats takes it to heart and will leave you fulfilled.

Clannad

High School of the Dead

The only thing I can say bad about it is that it's a bit expensive and having watched the show in a fan-subbed format before my personal experience contains those ""huh.. that doesn't seem right"" moments with minor translation differences.

This ""set"" lets you get the whole show in a beautiful format with audio that's flawless, I usually don't worry too much about audio quality but this stood out to me. The only problem is it's price is admittedly a little high most of the time for just a 13 episode show as despite having some rewatch value like most anime, it's never going to be the same as the first time. This is only something you should add to your collection if you're really a serious fan of the show.

4494283,3,B004XC5LHS,"Angel Beats!  is an immensely successful comedy and a virtual Hindenburg of a drama.  The main character wakes up in a high school purgatory where cute gun wielding girls and dips*** bros are struggling against the adorable and emotionally vacant Angel, who seems to have a mission to stop their rebellious ways and J Pop jam sessions.  Don't get me wrong.  That's the good stuff.

Let's linger on the good for moment because there is a lot of it.  The animation is fluid and bright but stylized in a way that makes it a unique success.  The action is violent and hilarious.  The characters are a laugh riot when humor is the goal of the scene.  The story is open ended with enough intrigue to keep you guessing.

The regrettable low points of this show are the forced teen melodrama and played out revelations that despite their heavy tone carry all the depth of the ""Wizard of Oz"" meeting ""What Dreams May Come.""  Whole episodes are stolen to explore the character of the weeks' past life pity party.  I don't want to crap too hard on their drama.  Some of the back stories are enlightening, and serve to thicken the characters, but most of them are kiddy pool shallow and don't match up to the sharp comedy and lightning fast wit of the action narrative.

It feels like the writers orchestrated a quick purgatory platform to sell their outrageous comedy and to poke fun a stereotypes, but when faced with the meaning of their world, fell into one of those stereotypes and churned out some painfully redundant teen drama and tied it up with a dues ex machina that might seem original to new anime fans, but is actually a very popular way to end a series.

All in all, this is a good show.  The comedy is spot on and smells like Excel Saga.  The animation takes blinding color to a new level and wields it well.  The action is gorgeous.  All of these wonderful things just end up taking a back seat to its weakest link (crepe thin introvert soul diving).  I would tell friends not to judge this anime by its cover, but after viewing I would say to go ahead.  The cover is pretty accurate.  High school girls, fun, guns and drama.  It just wish the drama would have taken a back seat and left the bland help-me-cuts to another show.

Watch Angel Beats!  It is still one of the good ones.",1387670400,4,2287,4.439903846153846

I also love the dark undertones, every character has lived a terrible life on earth and is now in a kind of limbo, unable to pass on and accept what happened in life. The animation is top shelf, the dub is great, the music score is also good. There is a great mix of comedy and seriousness, they got the balance just right. Some of the stories told in this anime will bring tears to your eyes, and I love that because it means you have invested time in very believable characters. Everyone is fleshed out well, and it is easy to fall in love with several characters. This anime should be in your collection!!",1387411200,,642,4.270491803278689
4494285,5,B004XC5LHS,"I've seen some criticism of this show.  Some say that it needed to be longer to truly achieve what it was trying to do.  Some seem to think that it fails miserably by trying cram too much into this short 13 episode series, that it muddles its plotlines, or some other criticisms that seem to me to miss the point.  Angel beats may very well not be long enough to do what it intended to do, but the thing is, it's a fantastic show!  It may not dwell on character development for the secondary cast, but it doesn't need to.  It's not a show revolving around a love triangle or other common Anime tropes, though some of them do play a big role.  Rather, it is reliant on the overall character arc, which really takes off around the third or fourth episode.  The action/comedy elements are less important by the end than are the characters' resolution of their own fears, doubts, and regrets so that they can come to peace with themselves and move on.  There is a romantic subplot, but it is buried between the lines and unspoken until the final moments, where the resolution of the main story will jerk tears from even the most reluctant of eyes (like mine - in almost 32 years of my life, only two shows have ever threatened to pull tears from my eyes, and the other was at the end of Les Miserables the first time I saw it on Broadway).

This is assuming, of course, that the watcher kept an open mind throughout the progression of the series.  It won't speak to everyone - almost nothing speaks to everyone.  Some people (many of whom seem to be snobby critics) might make up their mind long before they get to the end that they want to dislike it, but that's alright.  We all have tastes and opinions - I get it.  If you're like me, Angel Beats is ultimately the kind of story that will have you asking yourself what regrets you would have if your life ended today, or possibly ""do you need to let yourself forgive yourself for past mistakes?""  Generally, I prefer comedies or comedic romances, both when I watch Anime or standard American fare.  But Angel Beats, even with the comedic elements to the first few episodes, provides the kind of cerebral self-reflection-inducing deeper fare that I occasionally need to turn to when I feel more prone to soul-searching.",1383868800,,2267,4.468446601941747

4494319,4,B004XC5LHS,"Before I get into the nitty gritty of it all, let me first say that I really enjoyed Angel Beats!. Every episode was fantastic, and the characters were (nearly) all memorable. However, I can't say that I walked out ENTIRELY satisfied.

Lets just be honest. The series is way too short, and at the end you feel it. Almost all the episodes up until the final 2 or so felt absolutely fantastic. The pacing was great, the characters were all charming and had a lot of depth (even the supporting cast. No, especially the supporting cast), and the setting was unique and original. The anime plays very well off of it's environment, making for really unique comedy and tragedy that is quite impossible to replicate. Never thought you'd laugh at most of the cast being killed off did you? But that's the kind of unique angle that Angel Beats! takes, and should be respected for.

Angel Beats! also has a very nice blend of emotions. While sometimes it can waver in tone as it rapidly shifts gears from comedy into tragedy, it doesn't break your immersion. The more tragic stories the characters tell are especially tragic, and the moving scenes are of course especially moving. The amount of thought put into the supporting cast in characters such as Yui is quite astounding. In fact, that character in particular, while never really having much spotlight time made for the most memorable moment in the entire series.

However, there is one glaring flaw that keeps me from giving it a 5/5 like I do most things that I bother taking the time to review. And that's how it's just too damn short.

The final episodes were packing on punch after punch in plot twists very rapidly and characters progression came twice as fast. This is not a point in it's favor. While looking back a lot of the bigger plot points the series makes in those final two episodes or so are extremely impacting, it loses a lot of weight as the show just flat out didn't have enough time to set up the proper context for the characters to develop in that direction.

This series, in short, needs to be remade. That's not to say Angel Beats! isn't great, and for it's price point I'd say it's definitely worth adding to your collection. But I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that one day they'll expand the series into a 20+ episode endeavour, because this IP is completely worth the time to put into it.",1378857600,,2369,4.577830188679245

The associated genres are comedy, romance, drama and action, though this is a little ambiguous. I'd call it a ""supernatural slice of life""; realistic characters with realistic issues in a supernatural setting.

Almost the entire cast is completely believable, which is rare in this type of anime. Granted, there are dedicated dimwits, but they play the important role of lightening the mood when the plot gets serious... and it will. It will get downright emotional and bittersweet. The protagonist is very intelligent, personable and caring; he's not ignorant or introverted in the slightest, which makes the show refreshing to watch.

On to the bittersweet aspect, it is so both in it's final conclusion and as a whole. I was surprised at how well placed the humorous lighthearted moments were; you get a good laugh right when you need it before your torn heart turned into a plain depressed one.

We all knew the ending was going to be sad, but there was one curveball in particular I didn't see coming that made me tear up.

When it comes to soothing and touching music, this series has the best OST I've heard.

Angel Beats is a thirteen episode anime that follows a group of dead people in what I assume is limbo. It looks good, the plot sounds good, but the anime itself fails in a few respects. Most notably, in the character and story department. Not to say either are bad, they have high points, but especially with the nonsensical pacing of the story, there are problems. Let's take a deeper look.

The story of Angel Beats follows a man named Otonashii. He has died apparently and is suffering from amnesia. When he awakens on the other side he meets a girl named Yuri who runs a battlefront fighting against a girl they call Angel. The anime runs through the battlefront fighting Angel, but soon Otonashii finds out how mistaken they were in fighting the poor girl and he helps people understand her as they combat against an even worse foe, shadows that will eat the souls of the Battlefront members.

Toward the end Otonashii and Kanade (the angels real name) help pass people on from this Limbo. We learn a huge secret about Kanade and what should have been a startling revelation about Kanade getting a new heart when she was alive, Otonashii's heart, is not explained well enough for me to understand. Kanade was apparently in this limbo before Otonashii and I wonder if perhaps Otonashii had just been a wandering soul while Kanade was in this limbo. The time frame is confusing since Otonashii had to have died to give Kanade the heart, and Kanade had to have died after Otonashii.

Beside that there are a few problems with how Kanade knew she could manipulate herself and create abilities through using computers. This is a big part of the show that I guess is supposed to add a matrix-like feel. It just confuses me on how smart she is about this world and how she was there before Otonashii.

The ending is heart-warming/wrenching. Otonashii falls in love with Kanade and Kanade tells Otonashii thank you for giving her his heart. In his hands, Kanade disappears. It's a terrible ending, I wish Otonashii and Kanade could have been together and it certainly could bring a tear to the eye. I wish that this ending could have been happier. I'm not going to mark the story down for ending this way, but I wish anime would end happily.

Angel Beats has amazing animation. You can tell big bucks went into the animation. The fluid action, the great character design, the amazing backgrounds. It's a very pretty anime. I can't gripe about anything in this department.

The music of Angel Beats is not too bad. The opening is okay but not amazing, the ending song is okay, but not amazing. The band within the show, Girls Dead Monster, sounds pretty good and shines as the best part of the shows sound. Sound effects are good and voice actors do a good job of bringing emotion into the characters.

I wish I could say the show shines in the character department, but it doesn't, it does an alright job. There are so many characters that you won't get to really know but for one or two quirks, and the characters aside from Otonashii, Yuri, and Kanade are all not too exciting. Sure they bring some comic relief, but you don't feel for them. Maybe a little for the pink haired Yui and other characters who tell how they died and what they want to do to make up for their terrible lives; but otherwise they are bland. And why does Yui have a tail?

Otonashii isn't amazing as a character in any respect. He's likeable, he seems to be the voice of reason, but he's also bland. He's just a guy thrown into the middle of a big problem and he wants to fix it. At the end of the show you will feel bad for him, but you otherwise can't help but consider him generic.

Yuri is the same way. She's likeable for her past and likeable in general, but she's too much like other characters out there (Haruhi Suzumaya).

Kanade is a good character, you can feel for her, but there are just some problems in how quiet she is and none of her background in this limbo-like place is ever explained. She's the best character of the show, but she's still not an amazingly good character. She's merely good. And that's probably because she's the focal point of the anime. It's the same with Homura Akemi from Madoka. As the focal point, she has to be the best and most fleshed out character. Kanade isn't fleshed out much, but she is a good character emotionally and you can invest yourself in her just by feeling bad.

It's what I like to call Elfen Lied syndrome. Do terrible things to cute anime girls and you'll get an emotional response.

Angel Beats delivers a solid experience full of laughs and tears and decent action. The problem is in the fact that the characters all seem pretty conventional and it's pace is also sometimes tough to understand. There is a lot of seriousness, but when the episodes are just trying to be silly, it feels out of place. The animation and sound are good, the story could have been good if some of the areas were fleshed out a bit more and explained. The characters are not average, they are good, but I can't help but feel like I've seen these characters many times in many different bodies in many different anime. Kanade is the only character who stands out, and as stated, that mostly has to do with the fact she is the focal point of the show and any emotions you invest will more than likely be placed in her.

It certainly can be entertaining, but one of the things I think it's lacking is with the pace. I feel that if the series had been extended a bit more, it wouldn't have felt so oddly paced. If there were more episodes dedicated to the characters and not as much the plot it might have helped keep the series balanced and not allow for the few odd episodes about the characters that ruin the pace. It also would have allowed for the background characters to get some more screen time and for us to learn more about them and what their aspirations are, how they died, and things like that.

That aside, for what it is, Angel Beats is great. A large, colorful cast of characters, an intriguing backdrop, and what amounts to be a surprisingly heartfelt and compellingly watchable anime.",1372204800,2,6135,4.495511669658887

I started watching this series on a whim on Hulu, and was almost instantly hooked on a story that although it took place in a familiar setting for most anime series (a high school) had a surprising amount of genuine humor and heart to it that most other series I've seen failed to capture. It took a lot of anime cliches and turned them on their heads and ran with it, like the way many of the group members  ""die"" completing their first missions but its not really a big deal because all of the students (characters) in the high school are already in the afterlife, so basically a few hours they are back in the group like nothing happened...(in a South Park ""you killed Kenny"" kind of way ). Some people may be offended at first by the religious references, (and maybe somewhat at the title of this review) but I would just say before you judge watch the series to the end and you will find that this may be one of the most faith affirming (in the general sense) and inspiring stories you've seen (at least I think so). All of the characters in story are struggling to make sense of their ""lives"" and in the process the show deals with many age old human questions like ""why do good people suffer?"" and ""if there is a God, why does he/the creator allow it"", and the answers the show implies may surprise you. Despite this Angel Beats is not explicitly religious in the sense of advocating any particular view, but you do see a definite Buddhist/eastern influence but that being said it is not a show about religion but more about human relationships and what really matters in someone's life, yeah I know that sounds deep for an anime, but it handles all of these topics in a sometime suspenseful, humorous and maybe even enlightening way... Oh btw if you watch the series then you will get my review title reference, so please save the angry replies to a minimum if you haven't, and the ending of this series is ONE OF THE BEST I've seen of any TV/movie series period and will really pull at your heartstrings, and I say this as a guy......

4494345,5,B004XC5LHS,"The series Angel Beats deserves 5 stars, not only for it's impressive story line, but overall perfection.

The story line is done very well. It ties everything from beginning to end, and everything has a reason or purpose. There are a few things implied, but the story line is precise and allows yourself to relate to it.

The music of this anime is done in such a way to stir up your emotions. It shows everything at just the right time, with just the right scene.

The animation is very appealing to the eyes. Is very easy to watch over and over. You can tell a lot of work went into every second of the scenes made, which is much appreciated by the viewers.

This anime has a very important message sent across to the viewers. It's a life long lesson, we all need to keep in mind.

Despite that it sends such a message, there isn't any drama or anything that will bring you down. If you cry during this anime, it's cause you are happy for the characters. It's a very, very funny anime. I appreciate the fact they made an anime that could make me laugh. Every moment is enjoyable. And then they can tell you something serious, but they keep it light. And then there is some romance, which completely threw me off. I wasn't expecting it. But it was really sweet how it all tied together.

4494356,3,B004XC5LHS,"A strange potpourri of different flavors of fan fiction melt together to form a bizarre world that is a combination of Purgatory, a video game with NPCs and self-makeable PC upgrades, and a Japanese highschool fantasy verse setting.

Essentially the protagonist wakes up in an afterlife that is not reserved for everyone but only for specific individuals - particularly children with harrowed pasts -, apparently by mistake, due to his amnesia.  In this afterlife the young must come to terms with how their (relatively cheated) mortal lives went before they ""pass on.""  A Japanese Highschool apparently helps simulate their lost childhood for them by providing experiences a normal Japanese Highschooler would have.  A small group of juveniles refuse to pass on by skipping the school and wage war against the young Kanade Tachibana, who has managed access to ""Angel Player"", the software that apparently shapes this universe, which she uses to give herself superpowers.

The characters are OK.  The series gives them short backstories and makes some effort at building their relationships with eachother, but ultimately either due to its length or just simply how it is written the characters seem to come up a bit stock.

Stock characters aside, the plot is a series of escapades for the young brats that comprise of boring fights and humorous rhetoric.

The ending is fulfilling, although very open-ended, and heavily rushed when the viewer is hit with an explosion of information about ""The First Programmer"" that seems like it should have been played out in an additional 10 episodes rather than quickly explained by a deus ex machina character.  Clearly there was quite a bit of script, but probably not as much money or time to lay it down.  The creators did a good job with what they had, they just didn't have enough.

Overall, the series falls short of the potential of the script it had.  So its not a bad buy:  If you get it for a low price.",1354838400,2,1954,4.90273556231003
4494357,5,B004XC5LHS,"I am a fan of anime, but it isn't my only interest that occupies my time. Honestly though, this is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a while.

A brief synopsis of the plot:
All of the events take place in the after-life, which strangely enough happens to have a setting like a Japanese High School. Since everyone is already dead the show has a bit of a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor concerning death. On the other hand the show gets a bit serious and grapples with the ""Is there really a god?"" question. The major driving force of the plot is the Afterlife Battlefront and their rebellion against the Student Counsel President Tenshi. Tenshi is called Angel in the English version. Tenshi is simply trying to force people to go to class and be obedient so they can be erased. I will leave it at that as I don't want to spoil too much of the story.

The Good:
The show is very well animated and has a decent soundtrack, when Girls Dead Monster isn't performing. The Japanese voice track is what you would expect for a Japanese language track. The story has a little something for everyone. It has action, comedy, a little bit of light romance, drama, and a few lightly philosophical moments. The show will make you laugh and bring you to tears at times. The show is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome.

The Bad:
Not every character gets the back story treatment. The English Dub is just okay, its nothing spectacular. It's a little weird hearing the voice cast of Girl Dead Monster speaking in English and then singing in Japanese when the music starts.

Other stuff:
The show is pretty violent but thankfully it isn't filled with in your face fan service. I honestly  prefer the Japanese language track over the English, simply because the English dub feels off. I prefer to actually watch and listen than watch and have to read the subtitles.",1354579200,,1872,4.543026706231454

The art was great and both the Japanese and English voice actors fit the characters well. This is a great series for anyone who wants to watch a short, humorous, and entertaining series. (also a little sad, just be warned)",1351814400,,409,4.256410256410256
4494367,5,B004XC5LHS,"This anime series is the one i have seen the most times, right next to Kanon (i guess Jun Maeda is a good story teller :p ) it is really funny and has a very moving story.
i don't really want to spoil anything about it because knowing too much about the story would make it less impactful, and i am sure there are many reviews about the story that are much better than anything i could write, so instead i will talk about this release.

the video quality is what i would expect from a blue ray release. there is no artifacting, the image is nice with sharp lines and good color. the audio quality is good in both english and japanese.
i do start to take issue with this release starting at audio tho. This disk was the first i heard the english voice actors... i usually don't like english over japanese, so you can disregard this if you love english more, but i felt that the english actors lacked the ""hot bloodedness"" to accurately portray their roles for the most part. i understand that some of that has to do with the fact that english really has very little vocal variance compared to japanese, so it makes it less expressive, but for instance the in OVA much of the feeling is just not there. i also don't like some of the changes to the dialogue to make it fit english grammar better. like if a character says ""Cuuuuu~te!"" in japanese it was translated as ""It's so Cuuute!"" while it is more grammatically correct, it isn't uncommon for us to speak incorrectly for emphasis... unless it really is and i just picked it up from anime :p

now that isn't to say i actually love the japanese in this case... the subtitles are really boring, they are the standard yellow bs subtitles. i find that they really take a lot away from the art style when they are so terribly done. so for this release i actually would watch in english probably. perhaps i am spoiled by the fansub community because i first saw this series from the Coalgirls 1080p release. They have very attractive fonts a different one for the op and the rest of the show, And each character has a different colored font shadow that is the same color as their hair. this makes it extremely easy to tell what dialog is whose.

i really wish that these companies would put a little bit of effort into their releases. i am glad that i can get this amazing show for so little as opposed to importing, but i think for 40-50$ (and especially 70 which is the MSRP) they could afford to put in more effort than slap all the episodes on a disk.

the menu interface is a still image, with no background music. the audio select screen is unintuitive at best and non-functional at worse, and the most special feature there is is a promo video, which is just an advertisement...
i mean the japanese releases have behind the scenes information, director interviews, and other songs by GDM.
All that being said i do think this show is worth it because it is so good. Even if i had seen the show 5 or 6 times before buying it, i would still say this is a good purchase because it helps ensure other great series get picked up.
i just hope funimation gets the next super awesome series.",1351123200,2,3134,4.352136752136752
4494368,5,B004XC5LHS,"Angle Beats was an anime i checked out form mere curiosity. It was only thirteen episodes and the art work attracted me to it. I finished it recently and i've got to say one of the bets anime's out there.

Pot summary: Teenager Yuzuru Otonashi wakes up in the nighttime, at a school like environment and has no recollection of what happened to him or why he is where is his..oh and did i mention he's actually dead? That's right this anime's about otonashi meeting a bunch of other young spirit's like him in purgatory/ limbo. If you don't stay there you ""disappear"" and are gone from the world forever, your destination? nobody knows and it scares them into forming a group called the S.S. battlefront to stay in limbo. There's a lot more to it then this but i don't want to give the slightest spoilers away. The plot is something i didn't expect and is very original in my opinion.

Plot review: I admit i may not have given the bets description of what this anime is like so let me describe it to you: it's funny, has some action, romance, but mostly drama and stories about how some of these young spirits died. I always got my heart strings pulled when watching a flash back scene because they were all so sad and horrible. I didn't care much for the first two episodes but by episode 3 i realized this anime was something special indeed, and by episode 5 or 6 i was hooked. It wraps itself up nicely with an ending that can make anyone cry there eyes out i believe.

Flaws to the plot: angle beats has a few slight flaws plot wise: some scenes felt rushed but never forced, this is only 13 episodes and is meant to be short, sweet ( or sad in this case) and to the point. Also there's one plot hole tot he last episode however i actually found a logical explanation to it. Another thing is misplaced comedy certain episodes focused a bit to much on the little quirky/ funny scenes but they weren't to bothersome. Characters: i'm not going to give you a list of characters so i'll just say what i thought of them. They were so great and realistic, you grow to love them. I felt a special connection with many and they are very well written. The only minor complaint i have is that i wish they gave these tow characters background i wish they did. The characters in this series are very well done.

Music: Another thing angle beats excels in is music. The band ""girls dead monster"" in it has some very great music. The two songs: ""My song"" and especially ""My most precious treasure"" get me teary eyed every time i listen. The opening ""My soul your beats is gorgeous and if you look at the translation it fits the plot dynamic perfectly.

Animation: As i said before the animation for this one made me want to watch it. It's very shojo( misspelled) but the show is anything but really.

Overall: This is a series that will be missed by me. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 on a professional level, those little problems make a big difference when you've only got 13 episodes but on a personal level give it a 10/10.

Watch this amazing anime if your thinking about it, even non anime fans will enjoy this one. Just make sure to bring a tissue box with you.",1350518400,,3152,4.323181049069374
4494369,5,B004XC5LHS,"Angel Beats is another series by Key; the folks that did Clannad, Kanon and Air. It is about a world that I would describe best as purgatory. The inhabitants of this world are not there to pay for their sins. They are there b/c their lives ended before they had the chance to enjoy their youth. They are getting a 2nd chance before they pass on.

The primary character, Otanashi, wakes up in this world with no memory beside a girl hold a sniper rifle. She tells him he's dead, and convinces him to fight with her gang against a girl called ""Angel"". Angel is the student body president at the school everyone in this world attends. It is her duty to keep order. Some of the students believe that if they obey the rules they will be obliterated and pass on. This is why they fight against Angel. Otanashi learns he has a very special connection with the girl they call Angel.

Angel Beats is a sci-fi, action, drama, romance, adventure; all wrapped up into 13 episodes and 1 OVA. I could rave about it forever, but I'll just say that any anime fan that doesn't love this series is a bit odd.

4494370,5,B004XC5LHS,"This is a superb and moving series but be sure that you watch the ending all the way through as it occurs AFTER the final credits roll on the last episode.  The series is seemingly typical and shallow at first, but it is actually deceptively subtle in that it starts out as a wild series of outrageous battles all over what appears to be a high school.  Only thing is that this school is located in the afterlife (limbo? purgatory? the twilight zone?) and you can only get there by being young and dead.

It takes the main character, Otonashi, a little while to fully realize and accept the fact that he is really dead and caught in some kind of surreal afterlife where he is swept up into a group of students who are apparently fighting a war against God and an angel with some pretty heavy weaponry like .50 cal rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenades etc.  Otonashi also finds out at the very start that even though you are dead, you can still get  ""killed"" again in this weird reality but you come back to life after a while. Only thing is, even though you don't stay dead, every time you get killed it's brutally and painfully unpleasant and there are lots of ways for you to get killed again and again.

But the true core of this series begins to unfold layer by layer, like an onion being peeled, as Otonashi begins to form bonds with the other students in the group fighting a mysterious war against the powers that control this world.  Along the way through the furious battles and self-searching of the individual characters you see the development of wonderful relationships and some really profound questions on life vs. existence, reincarnation, love, God, and what makes a person's life qualify as truly worthwhile and fulfilling.  There are many moving moments as you see relationships develop and blossom among the characters and learn about their pasts as they learn about each other.

This superb series is all too short and leaves you wishing there was another season but the pacing and length are actually perfect for how the series resolves. Just be sure you watch ALL of the ending which actually occurs after the final credits in the last episode.

The English dub is pretty good and the music, artwork and animation are topnotch.

Long Review:
General Plot (no spoliers):  The main character, Otonoshi, wakes up with amnesia to a world he is not familar with...the world of the afterlife/purgatory.  Tenshi (Angel) and the Underworld Battlefront (led by Yuri) are the main sides in the struggle in this world.  After joining the Battlefront, and learning about this strange world from his allies that have been there longer than he, and eventually remembering about himself and his past, he helps change the path of everyone close to him.
.
Generally I'm not a fan of anime with school settings. This anime, however, isn't a typical school anime (often because the Battlefront does everthing they can not to conform to the norm).  It blends action and drama, happy and sad, very well.  And you'll find that you can easily connect and relate to the characters.  Good J-pop music for the opening, closing, and for the 'Diverson Unit' of Battlefront.  While a lot of people don't watch the opening and closing credits, I liked all of the subtle changes that were made to each that reflected plot/character changes throughout the series.
.
Languages:  Subtitles and Dubbing
The best way to watch this anime is with Japanese Voices and English Subtitles.
If I had watched this in the English Dub originally, I wouldn't have gotten past the first few episodes.
.
There are a lot of fan-subs for this one on the internet, so until I received it from Amazon, I wasn't sure which one I was getting.  I have mixed feelings about the English Sub.  Many scenes have the 'Diversion' band playing in the background behind the main action, which really fills up the bottom of the screen with sometimes 4 lines of text (2 just for the english & japanese 'romanji' text of the song).  In Asian copies of this anime, they put the song lyrics in the top and left sides of the screen...which helped in making the subtitles of the spoken words easier to read at the bottom.  The American version should have kept that format, but unfortunately didn't.  There are also a couple of places, where the text is not left up long enough to read.  There aren't many, but such poor pacing of the text should have been caught before production was finalized.  Because TK's background ramblings are usually in English, it really wasn't necessary (and is a bit distracting) to have his words in the subtitles. Lastly, the translation is sometimes not very good.  Thankfully it's generally subtle things that don't effect the main flow of the story, but annoying none-the-less.  ie.  ""Kancho"" a prank played by grade school children isn't close to the same as an ""enema"" (episode 1).  There are others, and oddly, the English dub doesn't make many of the same mistakes.  All-in-all, the English sub is acceptable...though I've seen better fan-subs online.
.
The Japanese Dub is amazing.  All of the characters have interesting unique voices, and are very expressive.  Comic timing is perfect, and the flow is kept moving by seamless exchanges of fast-paced conversation in many places.  I don't have one bad thing to say about the Japanese Dub.
.
I don't like the English Dub.  Otonoshi, Yuri, Hinata and Takeyama have good voices.  Yui (especially) and Tenshi are kind of annoying.  Most of the other characters blend together (boring/non-unique) so much that it's hard to tell them apart.  TK's defining character trait (hopping back and forth between English pop type phrases and some Japanese) is essentially destroyed by the Dub...moving everything to English.  Even some of the background sound effects are removed from the English Dub...which detracts from the overall experience.  The English Dub wasn't so much translated, as adapted in many places.  Some lines appear to have been ad-libbed, and the general demeanor of some characters change drastically from the original Japanese.  (ie.  Otonoshi is a pretty straight-laced student.  The English Dub changes/relaxes his character to try to make him more palletable to an American youth audience.) Lastly, due to the above, the English dub doesn't flow well in many places, and the comic timing that works so well in the original suffers as well.  There are many anime I will watch in English...Inuyasha, Full Metal Alchemist, Ranma 1/2, Cowboy Bebop (among others)...but this very good anime is reduced to middling quality when watched in the English dub.
.
In response to some reviews:
.
Some say that 13 episodes was too short.  I disagree.  The general story at the end necessitated a quick ending.  If it was too drawn out...and every charater was given the same attention as Iwasawa/Yuri/Otonoshi/Yui it wouldn't have fit the plot...and Otonoshi would have been discovered.  Yes, I too am disappointed that a 2nd season of this great anime isn't possible, since it ended definitively.  I'm also curious about what back-stories they could have written for TK, Shiina, etc...but I think 26 episodes would have been far too long, and the pacing would have suffered tremendously.
.
Some say that they didn't like the ending.  First, if you watch this anime, remember that there are often short scenes AFTER the credits/closing-song.  Do not miss these, because they're important for the story development and (in episode 13) the ending (changing a tragically sad ending into a bittersweet happy ending).  I like the ending.  It fit the story well, and I don't think it could have ended any better given what the characters believed and valued.
.
My grades:
A for storyline/characters.
B+ for plot execution. (some places were a bit forced)
A+ for Japanese voices.
A for J-pop music
C- for English voices and some translation.
B for subtitles (not horrible, but could be better)
.
Oh...and skip the OVA.  The series was great.  The OVA was annoying and not worth watching.

Hope this helps.  :)",1342569600,,6096,4.936211972522081
4494373,5,B004XC5LHS,"I first found out about this show by watching a YouTube video. Then I watched the opening. I was a bit reluctant to watch it at first, but I am extremely glad I did. I watched the whole series except for the OVA on YouTube. Boy, did I love it! It was a little of everything: action, humor, romance, tragedy, and everything in-between. My only beef is that it needs more. More episodes. There's just so much unsaid. But anyway, I usually don't cry about TV shows, but I shed a few for the ending. Overall, this is a masterpiece of an anime, and a good title to add to your collection. Jun Maeda (you may recognize this name from: Clannad, Air, Canon?) did a wonderful job on this and I can't wait for more!",1342224000,,705,4.229629629629629

After watching it two times, it still holds the same emotions experienced during the first time watching it. The music presented is also fantastic, and the music adds significant impact to the scenes at the perfect time. Definately recommended if you want laughs, fights, and even tears.",1340668800,,405,5.059701492537314

4494378,5,B004XC5LHS,"The first thing you notice about this series is the stunning picture and sound quality (even for blu-ray!). The animation is utterly superb; the opening sequence (of Kanade playing the piano) completely takes your breath away, and the end theme is also very poignant and beautifully done. The story is based on the unusual premise of a sort of 'afterlife' if you will (although not really in the Judeo-Christian sense; this one appears to be in a Japanese high school!) where the characters go after death, if they died feeling unfulfilled or badly-done-to. A side effect of being in this 'pergatory' is that the inhabitants cannot die; they can be 'killed' say by a gunshot or knife, but reawaken shortly after, fully restored. However; dying still hurts just as much as in the 'real' world, so they try not to be 'killed' too often! The characters can decide to 'pass over' to eternity, once they are convinced there is no further reason for them to stay. When that happens, the character simply disappears; usually the camera view will switch away from the character who is 'passing', and when it comes back, they are gone. No sound or visual clue accompanies their passing. The story follows the efforts of a group of the 'students', who have formed a band of rebel freedom fighters, to avoid 'passing on', as they feel aggrieved, and that it is God's fault that they died prematurely! I won't give any more detail, as it would spoil the story, but have your Kleenex ready; you will cry at various points in the story, especially at the end. But anime fans (and anybody else really), should see this series; it is beautiful, and VERY emotional; I cannot find a bad thing to say about it. Even the music score is awesome; I got the soundtrack album after watching the series - the full versions of the opening and closing themes (the latter being nearly 9 minutes long!) will also make you cry, especially if you read the translation of the lyrics; it is hauntingly beautiful. The English dub is excellent, with many of the well-known US voice actors appearing (Blake Shepherd as Otanashi, the male lead, Britney Karbowski as Yuri, Emily Neves as Kanade (also known as 'Angel'), Greg Ayres as Ayato Naio, and David Matranga (from 'Clannad') as Hideki), so many will be familiar with their voices.

I am only sorry that there doesn't appear to be a sequel in the offing; the ending of the series was kind of final, so it would be difficult to explain a sequel. A great pity.",1333756800,2,2476,4.678899082568807
4494379,5,B004XC5LHS,"Angel Beats! may very well be my new all-time favorite series, or content of anything I've ever watched! The story was absolutely incredible, and though many may complain, it worked perfectly in the 13 episodes it was released with. I do wish there was more, but I'm not sure if it would have worked if there were.

The story focuses on three main characters, Otonashi, ""Angel/Tenshi"" Kanade, and Yuri. Each three distinctive characters to the plot line that drive the whole story. No matter how you phrase it, this show sounds very strange to write in words without giving away the plot line, but I must stress how amazing of a story this is. And every single character in the show you learn to love a lot, there wasn't ONE character that I didn't like in this show, the side characters were pushed back a bit, but about 6 of them (including the main characters) had very interesting lives and backstories that you got to watch. The brilliant part about this episode is each character has a trouble, they first come into the world without having memories of their old lives. By taking the story by Otonashi's pov, the viewer gets to watch as a person has to just live without knowing anything about themselves other than their name until they later get their memories. Each character has terrible memories which is the reason for this ""second life"" opportunity where they each learn how to live.

It's a very interesting set up of plot, and each episode has you hanging on the edge. I must warn you this is VERY sad at times, especially the end. It also does a good job with humor and drama, which may sound odd to mix these three, but it couldn't work better. I think this is a series best for people who like to be sucked into atmospheres, different worlds for a while, and be dragged by their curiosity. It's always interesting, I even had fun watching it a second time. The story has the best characters I've ever seen, and I think that is why it is so enjoyable, each of them have sort of there own views on the scenario, and for once it's not about super geniuses or any type of hero. They are all regular people with a bad past that unite to find the truth of God. Again, sounds weird, but it makes sense.

For those who loved this story, there is a manga prequel known as Angel Beats! Heaven's Door that follows Yuri and Hinata when he first fell into this world.

I am more of a subbed type of person, however I first saw this show dubbed, (and I guess I can't compare it to many other dubs) but the English voice cast was actually very well done. I may have loved the dubbed better surprisingly (perhaps because that's how I first watched it..) Hands down a must see. I've already watched the whole series twice online for free.

The characters for the most part are well developed and you get attached to them rather quickly.

My one, single, solitary gripe is with the ending. Now, I don't want to dissuade you from watching, because as far as anime goes, this is just a blast. But that's exactly why I found the ending so frustrating, perhaps even unacceptable.

(MILD) SPOILER WARNING

The ending is sentimental to be sure, but for whatever reason, I was just emotionally CRUSHED by it.

Judging by a few other reviews here, many other viewers had the same reaction, but were still able to award the show 5 Stars. But I can't bring myself to do so. I understand the desire to avoid cliches, and I appreciate the occasional twist ending. But following the final scene of Angel Beats, I couldn't help feeling cheated. Introducing all these wonderful characters only to end the series on such a downer was cruel, and I don't know if I'll ever be ok with it.

A word to the wise: Handing the customer a depressant and telling them it's a stimulant isn't just irresponsible- it's downright rude.",1326326400,2,1160,4.694581280788177

I love some good action, but the illogical and seemingly senseless violence in this was yawn-inducing.  I finally gave up after the third or fourth episode, as the peraviding idiocy of the disjointed and repugnant ""plot"" continued to disappoint.

4494391,5,B004XC5LHS,"I normally hate when people do this, but...

This is a review of the show and not the actual product. I don't actually own the product yet, but I assume that there would be a lot more negative reviews if the product was somehow deeply flawed. I just think this show is worthy of more praise, so here it is.

I initially thought I'd hate the show when I first started watching it, but it sucked me in. So much that I ended up watching the entire series in just one sitting. It was a sitting full of laughs and tears,  and I truly mean real laughs and tears. Rarely do shows make me actually laugh out loud, even when I find them genuinely funny, but this one did. I'll admit that I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to emotional things, but I initially wasn't expecting to become so attached to these characters as I did. This show made me tear up numerous times.

There's only one place where the show truly falters, and it's at the last emotional plot reveal at the end of the final episode.  But this flawed revelation doesn't impact the overall story, and just comes across as a slightly greedy failed attempt to try and tug at the viewer's heartstrings one final time before the credits roll.

This show is surprisingly great. A wonderful example of why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, so to speak.",1320364800,2,1311,4.308943089430894
4494392,5,B004XC5LHS,"What happens when you are a Japanese high-school student and die too young? You wind up in a bizarre, Kafkaesque version of limbo designed by God is he/she was a game programmer. We have almost 20 main characters, running the range from the emotionless Angel to the stoner, TK. Much stands out in this series - the writing, the music, and battles.  While the final few episodes do seem rushed (don't skip the end credits of the final episode or you'll miss an important plot wrap-up!), at least they complete the series, and do it well. At only 13 episodes, it's one of the shortest series - I really would have preferred over 20, including an expanded episode based on those final few seconds.

There are enough plot twists and turns to require a GPS - you're never bored! The all girl band (with the highly original name ""Girls Dead Monster"") features your typical hot Anime babes, and the music is great - so good in fact that you can purchase the soundtrack (albeit now as a very expensive collectors item.) The music was even in the top of the Japanese music charts.

The animation is crafted as well as the music.  Near flawless, entertaining and very realistic.  I'd compare it to Full Metal Panic in style. The main protagonist, Otonashi, is easy to identify with and very realistic - he's one of the best characters I've seen in a while. His unusual ""relationship"" with Angel helps set the tone in the last half of the series. Personally I did not like the way the final episode handles it, but at least we were thrown a bone at the very end. Many people tear up at the final episode - it's that well done.

It's definitely in my top 5 anime. There are rumors of a 14th episode, set after episode 13, but this it could be confusion with the OVA- the additional episode set between 4 and 5 called ""Stairway to Heaven"", released after the series was completed.

The OVA is basically fluff - it's the most humorous episode in the series, accompanied by a ""Tension Meter"" throughout the episode. It's worth watching, but is not important to the time-line.",1319500800,,2060,4.536388140161725

4494395,5,B004XC5LHS,"This anime was among the spring 2010 line up in Japan. I read the Spring preview of this series on animenewsnetwork, it got an average review so I decided to pick it up later. Fast forward to the summer I watched the 13 episodes and by the end of it fell in love with the series. If I had to describe Angel Beats! its much like if Clannad and first Matrix movie got mixed together. You get a bunch of kids who realize the world they live in isn't real and they rebel against it to not ""disappear"". Thats only the first half of the series, because near the end it kind of ends up feeling like Clannad. Looking at the series in general, you can either love or hate the characters. You pretty much get the general anime cliche characters (the overly energetic girl, the cool glasses character, the agressive idiot, and the quiet girl). So depending on your tolerance of those kinds of people the level of enjoyment will vary. In this collection you get the 13 episodes plus the 14th/OVA episode. The only thing missing is the extra epilogue so you might want to hit up youtube to see that short 1-2 minute extra.

I think the biggest issue with the series in general is the length. Many people will agree that Angel Beats! could have been double in length to fully explore the characters. As a result the plot feels kind of rushed. That aside the overall experience you get from watching will make you want to consider how you live your life and perhaps how it infuences others. This is one of the many titles that I reccomend to all of my friends who are looking for other anime besides the mainstream stuff. Its a rare gem that takes short but sweet literally.

From its mysterious beginning to its tear jerking finale, Angel Beats! is a true gem worth buying and one that you'll want to pass on to a friend your done with it.",1318032000,,1825,4.364705882352941

Oh, how unfortunate that it is not, because with more time to expand the plot and characterization, this series would have been great. But as is, it is not. There was a point near the end of the series where I simply had no clue who one of the characters was. Too many characters, not enough time for them all.

But with that said, when the series does take time to focus on individual characters -- it really does shine. And the last episode is especially touching, but at some level, I had to feel like that since everything ran through so quickly, it was difficult to be as affected as I should have been. (I will admit to feeling emotional nonetheless, highlighting how good they were able to write and direct the scenes.) Also, Yuri is not a compelling female lead, and the OVA is just bad. While character development is good, I feel like it occurred without sufficient explanation, and felt disjointed.

And really, disjointed is the key word here. Good individual scenes, but mainly due to the series length constraints, it does not come together to make a *good* series. Compelling, yes, and worth watching, but I don't feel that it holds up under scrutiny.",1317427200,12,1249,4.596412556053812

This causes a confrontation between them and a girl they call 'angel'.  Because everyone is dead, injuries disappear after a short time.  So, there are no lasting consequences when violence is used.

This anime is a mix of drama, comedy, and action.  Music also plays an important role in this anime.  It's a good mix.  My only complaint is the situations that cause most of the action sequences after the beginning feel forced.  The action is there to add variety, but the action is obviously an afterthought in the story.  So things are added that don't need to be just to have an excuse for an extra battle or two.

It's also fun to watch the students go after a character named Angel who they believe has access to some outside information. I recommend getting Angel Beats.

I usually am turn away with these types of Animes, because I usually think it's just about some dumb guy that likes watching girls butts or breasts and he starts a relationship with one of the girls he sees. But....this is nothing like that!!! By watching this anime, it turned out to be one of my best watching decisions I have ever made. It's nothing like what I thought it would be. It actually had a very original story to it.

I thought there was going to be a 3 way love triangle in there, but there wasn't. Instead I find a lot of friendships building and growing. There wasn't really any love relationship forming??? Then, I found out why at the end...it was so original. lol

I really like the music and songs they have. It was very up beat with a classic and rock feel to it.

I don't like how short this anime was. It is really too bad it couldn't have been longer. I felt that there was much room to go on to another season without any drag to it.  The 1 season it had was great, but I'm sad to see it end. I really like the ending. That's saying a lot because I usually hate how things end, but this one...they actually did it right!

 I realize it is all about personal preference and this did not do much of anything for me. I will not go into the story as there are already a bunch of reviews that do that. All I can say is that you may want to rent this one before you buy.
  Over all...maybe three and a half stars.

 If there was one thing that I could ask of Amazon it would be some kind of age verification. As age will often influence a persons likes and dislikes. As for me I am getting close to 50 and some series I will agree with and age may not play a factor...Fullmetal Alchemist..Blood +...etc. Yet this series was rather a disappointment after reading all the sparkling reviews...I guess I expected to much.",1313625600,10,1109,4.134883720930232

The series is extremely light hearted at times, while holding the overtone of the plight of all the characters involved in place as the main part of the show throughout.  The key is the characters.  If you can bring yourself to care about the characters, this will be one of the better shows you watch.  If, howerver, you can't bring yourself to care about the characters at all, then you will likely view this as an overdramatic version of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

Like everyone shows, to me, this show deserves NO LESS than 4 stars...IF THAT LOW. I don't want to describe the show to you but I will describe the overall plot. Everyone is dead & stuck in Purgatory (Limbo). They either have the option of fighting to stay in a high school that's used as Purgatory or being Obliterated (pass on or be reincarnated) by the resident Angel. Nobody can die...or at least stay dead...when shot or dealed a lethal blow but they still feel all the pain of the death blow.

The show is extremely funny because people die over & over for stupid reason but eventually come back in a few hours. So, you don't feel sad for the death of your favorite character. It will give you the background of characters to explain how they ended up there. So, there will be sad points here & there but not to the point where you'll flow with tears. It's perfectly balanced with sadness & hilarity. Overall, this show is a must have for any anime collection & its good for all ages. Most likely PG rated to me.

4494412,5,B004XC5LHS,"Unlike Kyoto's previous adaptions, Angel Beats! is a series that plays more along a cold, grody landscape. Here we have an entire battlefield (and I mean that literally) filled with guns, heartless tales of death, and heart filled tales of death. However, what Angel Beats! does have in common with its Kyoto predecessors is its bittersweet ending and its powerful ability to invoke emotional distraught from within you. The series starts off like no other Key series does; with blood spilling to the ground and the clashing of metal upon metal. Here we have Otonashi Yuzuru, the main character, being gutted within the first five minutes, and surprisingly enough, not dying...or, he's just already dead. You'll soon notice that everyone in this series has already died and been transported to a quasi-like form of an afterlife, and that Otonashi's only chance of getting any answers is to join the rebellion that's waging war against the very God that brought him there.

In terms of quality; I really do have to give props to Sentai Filmworks. I remember buying an anime DVD set (a premium edition no less) a few months ago, and when comparing it to the encodes I had gotten offline, I noticed the DVD's were inferior in quality. So upon first getting Sentai's blu-ray set, I immediately began comparing its quality to both the best encodes you could get offline, and the original Japanese source (I have the original blu-ray discs). I noticed they were all about equal in quality, meaning Sentai's blu-ray set was neither inferior in quality to the encodes, nor the original Japanese source. The audio was crisp and the video quality was top-notch!

I would consider purchasing this series if you're interested in a story driven by emotion. Angel Beats! is an emotionally powerful anime, but its plot lacks... a lot, in terms of consistency. In only 13 episodes it tries to introduce too many characters, and thus crowds the series. The ending does seem a bit contrived, even if it is beautiful in its own way, and although the main characters are extremely likable, their stories are far too short, as the series, with its short duration, doesn't allow any indulging from the viewers in this respect. I do, however, recommend this series and don't want my criticisms to be a deterrent, just something to look out for.

My rating: 4.5/5",1312329600,8,2339,4.871859296482412
4494413,5,B004XC5LHS,"I can't help but feel my review should be longer for such a masterpiece, but I think I can state everything that needs to be said pretty succinctly.

... Okay, fine.  I can't.  There's a tl;dr version at the end for you lazy butts.

This series is, by far, the greatest thing I've ever seen.  (By ""thing,"" I mean among all of the anime, movies, web series, TV series... whatever.)  By far, the two strongest points of the series are the emotional involvement and the music.  The series does an AMAZING job at making you feel for the characters.  All of their stories touched my heart in ways I can't begin to describe.  Although admittedly, some of the characters aren't given much depth.  But, I'd say, with how short the series is, they did awesome with just the ones that ARE explored.

As for the music, this series has the most beautiful, powerful, and moving music I've ever heard.  The intro and outro themes are easily the best out of any anime I've ever seen.  And, especially once you start learning the characters' stories and feeling for them emotionally, they gain a level of unprecedented beauty and emotional appeal/connection that you have to experience yourself to believe.  It's extremely hard to get hold of the tracks (legally) in the US, but if you can, by all means: GET THEM.  Actually BUY the songs and support these talented musicians.  The songs gain even more meaning when you hear their full versions and read the translated lyrics.  The women that sing the songs have the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.  No contest.  BUT, I do wish they hadn't abused the soft, sad ending song during scenes that were meant to be funny.  It just seemed disrespectful for such a beautiful song and wasn't necessary at all.

Another particularly strong attribute of the series is the beautiful animation.  The visuals are absolutely GORGEOUS.  It's for this reason that, if you're debating whether you should get the Blu-ray or the DVD, WHY ARE YOU EVEN WONDERING?  Get the BD.  The visual quality it affords makes the act of watching/downloading it illegally even more of a crime than it already is.  [At the time of writing this review, the price for the Blu-ray is $59.99.  I don't understand why it's so expensive now; I got it on sale for $38.99.  Such a ridiculous price increase is... well, ridiculous.  Hopefully the price will deflate once it's been out for a little while.]

The English dub is phenomenal as well.  I tend to watch anime in English so I can keep track of the visuals and not have to try reading subtitles at the same time.  Luckily, if you're like me, it's good news for you.  Every single English VA delivers their lines with the perfect tone and emotional compulsion you'd expect.  I can't remember a single line that sounded like it should've been delivered better.  AND, every VA matched and portrayed their respective character BEAUTIFULLY.  They also don't muddle with the soundtrack at all.  (Some people expressed fear of them trying to redo the songs in English, which is a completely retarded idea.  They left them untouched.)  However, there are a few minor errors in the English dub.  In episode 4, Otonashi says ""It looks like she has good reflexes than me.""  I'm just like, ""WTF?  How'd this make it to the final product?""  I'm not even gonna try to give possible excuses.  Also, in episode 10, they clearly pronounce ""suplex"" wrong.  But that's it.

I like how Angel Beats! is sexy without dishing out fan service outright.  If you don't know what fan service is, it's basically when characters (almost always female) are shown in skimpy (or no) clothing to appeal to the (almost always male) members of the audience.  For it to be considered fan service, the exposure of the character is gratuitous (aka: not necessary whatsoever).  (I'm looking at you, Evangelion; although there are many offenders in the world of anime.)  There are extremely attractive female characters that don't need to expose themselves to be beautiful, appealing, and/or sexy.

However, despite all of it's amazingness, Angel Beats! isn't without a couple flaws.

The first is that it should've been longer.  Although I hate series that are too long, and they did great with how long they decided to make it, it's obvious there could've been more to it.  For example, they could've done more send-off episodes for the minor characters (besides the one, which I won't spoil).  Although it would've taken way too long to do an episode per person, they could've squished 2 or 3 easily into one episode.  Also, I feel there could've been more exploration of their world.  I myself am not even sure what I mean by this, but it's true.

The second is the ending.  There were some big, fundamental qustions that would've been nice to have answered--mostly regarding the world itself, and Kanade.  It felt rushed.  (See my note at the bottom regarding executive meddling.)

*** WARNING:  This paragraph contains SPOILERS.  Skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to read SPOILERS ***  It saved itself from being a total tearjerker (erring WAY to the bitter side of the bittersweet scale) with the little 15-second or so clip at the end; without it, I'd probably cry myself to sleep every night.  When Kanade and Izuru (Otanashi) run into each other in the real world again, it would've been much happier if they had actually shown them looking each other in the eyes and smiling or something.  It would only add maybe 10 seconds and, in my opinion, would leave viewers much more at ease without changing anything.  In my own little perfect fantasy world, it would've been best if it had briefly shown them ALL actually meeting up again in the real world.  But oh well. *** END SPOILERS ***

Anyway, there are a few little insignificant flaws more nitpicky people single out, but they don't make any real difference to me in the scheme of things.

tl;dr:  Beautiful series that takes out your heart strings and plays a beautiful melody on them.  Favorite anime of all time.

Let's recap:
+ Deep character exploration
+ Beautiful emotional appeal
+ Heart-moving music
+ Stunning visuals
+ Great English dub
- Should've been longer

PS:  I just wanted to emphasize the emotional power of Angel Beats!  When I first heard there was humor in it, I was a little turned off.  But after watching it, I realized that if they hadn't mixed humor in with the emotional drama, it would probably be a lot harder on your heart strings.

Update:  I watched the series 3 times in the first week since having it, and am looking at a 4th viewing.  This is the only series I've had such an urge to rewatch.  The comedy gets funnier every time, and the ending still never fails to bring a tear to my eye.

I found out that the reason the series is only 13 episodes is due to executive meddling.  The director wasn't very happy.  That's why it's so short and feels so rushed.  It was originally planned to be 26 episodes.  At least it makes rewatching it easier... but let's face it, that doesn't even come close to fixing the fact that it's half as long as it should've been.",1312329600,5,7086,4.681818181818182

While watching this show, I cried from sadness for the characters, I cried out of joy for the characters, I cried many many times with side splitting laughter, and I cried from abject horror at some of the character's experiences.  This show brought me to the edge in every category and did it seamlessly.  In truth, I have never been one to be moved to tears by any for of media (Clannad: After story is one of the few exceptions).  I was amazed when the show made me feel tears coming on the first time.

I've only watched up to seventh episode due to air times but I enjoyed the moments in this anime. (Why not watch in internet? I don't want to finish this anime to quickly. Plus it gives me something to look forward to watch in our tv). When I first watched this, I was very skeptical. But then, I found my self laughing along the way. Their dialogues are somewhat believable and some of the scenes are just naturally hilarious. My older sister, who is more strict when watching anime, also laughed at some of the parts of the show. Of course, this still has its dramatic moments. Some memories of the students of when they were alive will be revealed and might find peace after they have found their resolve. One thing I noticed is that the way the anime ends an episode usually tends to be a somewhat sad scenario(not always), which drives me curious of what's going to happen next.

What I also like is that the drama and comedy are not overdramatic or extreme. You will see what I mean once you have watch an episode or two.

I tend to be unbiased when it comes to anime as not to cloud my opinion. I've already seen cliches that will normally stop me from watching this. However, I found this anime a bit different in terms of their storyline. I'm sooo glad I decided to watch this anime.

After watching the third episode, I made a decision: I have to buy the dvd. I hope the dvd has extra features other than subs, dubs and trailers.",1310688000,2,1953,4.342465753424658
4494424,5,B004XC5LHS,"This series is short; It's 13 episodes. However, it accomplishes so much in that short timespan.

The series starts out like an action series, but it's so much more than that. It is potentially one of the most well-rounded series I have ever watched; Action, comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance are all covered - in amazing fashion - and by the end, the viewer is left emotionally attached to the characters, allowing for a good cry at the finale. The character development is very strong, but unfortunately the briefness of the series renders it impossible to cover EVERYONE'S backstory, which leaves you wishing for more a bit. That said, I am completely and utterly satisfied with the series as a whole. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next one, without an overly heavy use of cliffhangers.

It is very rare to come across a gem like this: Short, very well written, and executed nearly flawlessly. I would strongly recommend fans of ANY genre of anime to watch this.

4494425,5,B004XC5LHS,"So, for the longest time I put off watching this show even though I definitely knew I was interested in it. All I can say is I WISH I had watched this sooner. By the time it was done it easy moved past both of my favorite TV Shows into a number one spot. The anime, although it has a slightly serious undertone(as with most of Key's stuff), was perfectly balanced with humor action, and even some romance, but not enough to deter someone who usually doesn't watch one of the genre's. If the character's back stories don't make you tear up, I promise by the end you'll be crying out of happiness or something. I think that's what it was. I literally wanted to stand up and give a slow clap after it was done. Some people might say that it was too short or that it needed to focus more on some other characters as well, but personally I think it did a perfect job. Yeah, it didn't go into detail on everyone involved and I can understand wanting to learn a bit more about the other characters but in my experience I've found that the animes which take the time to do that end up feeling a bit draggy. This one was great at picking the characters that really stuck out the most to us, development-wise, and telling us their stories. Plus, I didn't get that ""that's all?"" feeling I get after most animes, it was a finish like Fooly Cooly, just enough to leave you wanting to watch again, but you know it had the best possible ending for how the story played out.

And if that's not enough, the anime has an amazing soundtrack, I've been listening to it on replay all day. Point is; A Definite must see for all.",1309651200,2,1606,4.248366013071895
4494426,5,B004XC5LHS,"If there is a just god, why do the innocent suffer?  Angel Beats! does not try to answer this question, so much as it offers a hopeful fantasy--children who died in the real world are allowed to finish childhood in a purgatory of sorts.  This purgatory of course exists as a high school, and one only wonders if there are elementary, middle and college dimensions.  The students in Angel Beats! are your typical group of ""outsiders""--since they don't go to class (if they did, they would disappear), they are outfitted in delinquent uniforms, and spend their days exchanging shots with the class president, seemingly a mix between Rei from Eva and Edward Elric from Fullmetal.

Angel Beats! succeeds on many different levels--comedy, action, drama, and pathos are masterfully blended, providing a show that is as moving as it is quirky.  The first several episodes focus predominantly on action and humor, and it's these two elements that Angel Beats! arguably does best.  However, as the characters develop, we gain more insight into the lives they led before they died, and get acquainted with the psychic pain each suffers.  The pathos is well executed and never devolves into melodrama, and the series has two alternate endings, each with its own ramifications.  Ultimately, Angel Beats! is a story of consolation: an acknowledgment that the innocent suffer and die, and a hope that somewhere they may have a second chance.

This is one of the most touching shows I have ever seen, not just in anime, but in all forms of media. I fell in love with this show from the first episode and couldn't stop watching it, I was hooked on it so much that I finished it an entire day and I have no regrets.

Of course I'm going to be getting this the second it comes out here in the states on DVD. This is a show I could watch over and over and over again, I would never get sick of it.

I don't want to spoil the plot but I'll go into little detail just to get your head wrapped around it. When these young students die they are sent into an afterlife that they do not truly understand and they believe if they give up and announce they truly died they will vanish from existence, it's only when the characters ban together and work along side each other do they understand the truth about dying in peace.

This show has so much going for it, a tremendous musical score, great comedy for the relief, a wonderful cast of developing characters, and one of the best stories I have ever seen. I don't care how strong you are or if you are too manly to cry, when you see that final episode you will have tears streaming down your cheeks on just how fantastic it is.

The story centers on Otonashi, a young man who suddenly wakes up inside an unknown school grounds, there he meets Yuripe, a girl who tells him to help her find god so she can kick/punch him in the face, now this may sound weird, however Otonashi soon finds out that what the girl says is not entirely out of whack.

This anime is a combination of drama with comedy and its actually quite well blended, though sometimes it feels forced, however most of the time due to the story you realize its not necesarily forced but rather obvious.

The story in this anime has soo much potential, that its a shame it was only made a 13 episode series, the cast of characters is quite big and you get attached somehow to most of them so its really disappointing how they only focused on the backstories of a mere few, you could say this is the biggest gripe I have with this series.

The animation, music, characters and story are all top notch, and it should be viewed by everyone at least once, I gave it a 4 outta 5 becuase it was obvious this anime needed a few more episodes as stated in many message boards during the time of broadcast, either that or not make all the characters soo awesome. :)",1307664000,67,1310,4.270161290322581

------18 FEB 2017 update------
My mind changed over the years when looking at this series. I still love it despite its many flaws...too many characters with unknown backstories, strange plot changes (the Shadows Arc), making a 13 episode series for what was originally going to be 26. I read that in a development article. I don't know if that's true or not but that would have definitely given a good backstory episode devoted to our 18 characters.

Anyways, why I'm changing my 5 star review to 4 is because of the English cast. Seriously, is Sentai Filmworks THAT cheap that they have to reuse EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEIR VOICE ACTORS FOR ALL OF THEIR SHOWS? No joke. The entire English cast of Clannad is here and a lot of their voices just sound wrong with these characters. Seriously...all the voices are here except Otonashi and Ooyama's characters:

Yuri -- Ryou
Angel/Kanade -- Kotomi
Yui -- Fuko
Hinata -- Okazaki
Iwasawa -- Nagisa (At least her VA, Luci Christian changes her voice up a bit s she doesn't sound like Nagisa)
Noda -- Yoshino (sounds so wrong)
Fujimaki -- Akio (also sounds wrong)
Naoi -- Sunohara
Hisako -- Misae
Irie -- (Mei)
And I don't know who plays Shiina but her voice seriously doesn't match. A proper, serious woman belonging to the feudal era of Japan was her Japanese voice while in English she sounded like some valley girl from California.

This is just my opinion and why I skip English dubs.",1306800000,4,2031,4.664804469273743
4494431,5,B004XC5LHS,"best anime that I have ever seen that was only 13 episodes long and out of all the animes I have seen it is my number 3 favorite anime ( after yu yu hakusho and one piece but those are main stream ). Though the only thing about this anime is that it WILL make you cry... when? not going to spoil that little detial you have to watch to know. This anime is a MUST see if you like music, action, romance all packed into one anime. For those that are not into that kind of stuff it has plenty of comedy scenes in it to keep you busy rolling on the floor laughing... literally. If you are looking to get into anime then this might be the anime for you due it short amount of episodes. I highly suggest buying this anime to any and all fans of animes",1304640000,,745,3.9403973509933774
4494432,5,B004XC5LHS,"Angel Beats! is by far one of the best series I have ever seen. It's a bit short, but it's the perfect length for the amount of content covered in the story. As previous reviews have said, there's a lot that could have been done with the series, especially fleshing out minor characters, but to try to do that in 13 episodes would have been terrible for the series as a whole. (If you've ever watched Kyoto Animation's adaptation of Air, you know what I'm talking about.) I honestly would have loved for Angel Beats to be twice the length that it is, but it's still great as it stands.

As for the dub, I got to see the first episode of it at this year's Anime Boston. It's being done by Sentai Filmworks, but don't let that discourage you. I know that their dub of Clannad wasn't exactly the most popular, mostly because of voices that didn't fit the characters at all. They've done a much better casting job this time around, and every character sounds just the way they should, not far off from the original Japanese voices. Most importantly, the GirlDeMo songs (or at least the one in the episode shown at the convention) are completely untouched. My main concern about this dub was that they would try to translate the songs into English and fail, but they haven't changed them one bit.

In short:
If you've seen this series before and you liked it, buy it.
If you've never seen it but like action, buy it.
If you've never seen it but like comedy, buy it.
If you've never seen it but like stories that make you cry, buy it.
If you've never seen it but like excellent music, buy it.

Basically, buy it.",1304380800,152,1606,4.382550335570469
4494433,5,B004XC5LHS,"Anyone who would call themselves an ""otaku"" had better get this series. This was probably the most epic series to come out of Japan in 2010. Be warned, however...if you don't like tear-jerkers, stay away! The story will just about rip your heart out.

Angel Beats! is amazing and a definite must have for any anime fan. I would agree with the above however; the dub needs to be as good as it can be, and I'm hoping that if they can't re-write Girls Dead Monster's songs into English that they leave them alone (they're one of the best parts of the series).",1304294400,6,556,4.398058252427185

This show is definitely worth Owning.

Overall Rating 4/5
The title and the description of the show give away the premise.  The show is about a bunch of dead teens in strange afterlife high school.

An anime about high school nooooooo Yes, its good though.  Theres guns and explosions and battling.  When you already dead can you die again, the show mixes comedy with action and has some drama for dessert.  Definitely not a show to miss, its out of print now. So BUY IT before the price goes sky high.

Theme Songs 4/5
This series opening and background music are solid good, ending theme is a bit slow but good too.

Ending 4/5
NO spoilers, the end was imperfect but worthwhile; no complaints really.",1518652800,,732,4.576923076923077
