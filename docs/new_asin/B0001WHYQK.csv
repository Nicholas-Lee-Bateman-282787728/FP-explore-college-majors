8016894,5,B0001WHYQK,"A Soviet musical comedy about an American circus artist who has a black baby; having suffered from racism in the United States, she discovers that the only way and place she can find happiness is among the Soviet people.  Happy citizens of all nationalities -- in a film made at the beginning of the Great Purge period.
A somewhat silly film with a strong message, although twisted when considering historical context.  Probably the most famous of the Stalinist musical comedies.",1080604800,3,479,4.975
