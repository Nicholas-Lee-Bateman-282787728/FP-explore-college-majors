3037290,3,B000Z27HFE,Story of the people staying at a seedy motel. Some of them you care about some of them you don't. I believe the were trying to be funny in places but it really didn't make it. You did feel empathy for a few of the people and others you wanted to smack. It is not an academy award winner by any stretch but it is a good movie for a day you've nothing better to do.,1346889600,5,363,3.789473684210526
3037291,4,B000Z27HFE,"If you have ever seen Craig Ferguson in anything this is a must have DVD. I like anything he has done from writing to acting, and on his late, late show. What a character, would love to meet him someday. If your not a fan and you watch this, you will become a fan.",1336867200,5,264,3.9074074074074074
3037292,4,B000Z27HFE,"Those buying this flick as a vehicle for Craig Ferguson may be a wee bit disappointed.  It's not that he's invisible here but his actual screen time lags behind his co-stars.  Ferguson is omnipresent serving as the glue to the different story strands.  Truth be told this is kind of a chick flick.  There are three central stories and all involve women front and center.  The main one involves a pregnant waitress contemplating abortion and a career in porn.  Another concerns a harried housewife who considers prostitution to help her family's sagging economic fortunes.  Lastly, a recent female parolee who attempts to regain custody of her child after getting out of prison.  Those going into this film thinking they are getting a comedy will be sadly mistaken.  ""Niagara Motel"" is a comedy alright, a human comedy, which borders on the tragic.  It is interesting and different and not without it's flaws.  It takes a while to latch onto the film's rhythms but once it grabs you will be enthralled.  A definite sleeper worth pursuing.",1303344000,12,1037,4.896551724137931
