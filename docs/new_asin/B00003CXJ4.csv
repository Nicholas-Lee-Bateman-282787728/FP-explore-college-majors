1270172,4,B00003CXJ4,"Chicken Run is a very interesting and creative movie. The animation is great and the plot, a mix between Stalug 17 and Hogan's Heros, is  imaginative and witty. If this movie has any issues is that it seems to be  aimed specifically at children and doesn't have even a hint of humor that  could maintain an adults interest for long. This doesn't make this a bad  movie, just not as good as it could be.
The movie starts out with an  initial jail (coop?) break led by Ginger, the main character. As what  becomes common place in the early parts of the plot, she gets caught and is  put in ""solidarity"" confinement. After many attempts a  ""flying rooster"", recently escaped from the circus, drops in.  Ginger gets the false impression that Rocky can really fly and blackmails  him into trying to teach the hens to fly. This is probably the most  entertaining and humorous part of the movie. Of course there is the  important ""save the life of the female lead"" scene, the  ""falling in love"" scene, the ""male lead leaving without  saying good bye"" scene, and of course the final ""hero returns to  save them all"" scene.
Overall, this is an enjoyable movie for  children, and adults would enjoy it too if taking children to it. Just be  forwarned, if you're an adult and would be going alone, pass on this one.  There are better ""childrens"" flick that will keep your attention  (Rocky & Bulwinkle).",964310400,,1392,4.585365853658536
1270173,5,B00003CXJ4,"Well, I took my children to see it (2/5 year old) and they LOVED IT.
Jumped up/down screaming and pointing at the characters.
My children have been long time fans of Grommit, so this film is RIGHT UP  THEIR ALLEY!",964224000,,213,4.325
1270174,5,B00003CXJ4,"This movie was fantastic.  I have never seen anything like it.  While taking place on a small English farm in a Stalag 17 style, a hen house of  chickens warm your heart and make you laugh at the same time.  After  reading the other reviews, I won't waste space describing the plot.  Being  only an hour and a half long, Chicken Run is able to capture your attention  and hold it all the way through.  The attention to detail is awesome!  Although I was startled at first to see a chicken with teeth, after viewing  the movie I must admit that was one of the details that makes the film so  refreshing and funny.  Even in the slow parts (there aren't many) it is  entertaining enough to listen to chickens with British accents.  Priceless!  A must see!",963360000,17,752,4.37956204379562
1270175,5,B00003CXJ4,"I went to see Chicken Run a few days ago, egged on (no pun intended) by the frequent advertisments on TV. I originally thought that it would be  good for a laugh, and maybe a little entertainment. I stand corrected. Now  I have to say that it was one of the best movies I've seen in theater since  The Matrix came out; and this is heavy action/adventure fan talking. Not  only is the plot quite original and funny, the characters likable and even  somewhat human, but the claymation is amazing. I don't think that even the  best computer animation could have topped the affect that was given by  these little clay chickens that I have grown to love. Every character has  their own certain quirk that makes them so much fun to watch, and all their  crazy escape plans left me in stitches. Chicken Run is without a doubt the  best family film of the summer, and perhaps even of the whole year; even  action buffs like me can get into it. I say two wings up...waaaaaay up!",963014400,,969,4.387640449438202
1270176,5,B00003CXJ4,"CHICKEN RUN from Aardman Productions is a treat through and through.  This feature length claymation film was created by Nick Park and team, the  creators of the Oscar-winning characters ""Wallace and Gromit.""  Since I am a long-time ""Wallace and Gromit"" fan I went to this  movie with high expectations -- I was not disappointed.
The characters  develop nicely as the show moves along, and the voice actors really help  the claymation characters come to life.
The best way to describe this  movie is, well, ""Wallace and Gromit"" meet ""The Great  Escape.""  Wallace and Gromit do not appear in this movie -- the main  characters are a pair of chickens and the human owners of the chicken farm.  While the lead roles are good, I think that the supporting characters move  this show from ""cute"" to ""memorable and lasting.""  I  particularly like the clueless knitting chicken and the staunch old-school  former R.A.F. rooster.  The humans also do their bit to keep things  rolling.
The premis for the movie is this (without giving too much  away)...
Chickens in a patrolled, fenced-in yard must lay eggs or they  are taken to the block and served up for dinner.  One chicken  ""Ginger"" is not willing to accept that as their fate and she  plans a series of unsuccessful escapes.  The stakes are then upped when the  chicken owners plan to change their operation from egg to chicken pie  production!
For those of you who may be fans of WWII POW movies, keep  an eye open for connections to and even scenes from movies like ""The  Great Escape,"" ""Stalag 17,"" and others.  The wife of the  chicken farmer seemed somewhat Commandant-like to me, and her husband was  very much the dull-witted but dangerous head guard type.
This movie is  watchable for the entire family with sight and verbal gags for children and  for adults.  The only violence is implied but not shown (i.e., killing a  chicken with a hatchet -- followed by a plate of bones).
5 stars all  the way.
Enjoy!

1270177,5,B00003CXJ4,I went to see Chicken Run on friday night. I went to the movie thinking  that it would be all right but not great. I saw the preview and just  thought that the clamation was great. I did not expect it to be such a  great movie. I went in to the show and saw half of the theater was kids and  the other half old folks. The movie started and the opening scene not only  made the kids and the older people laugh but I caught my self laughing as  well. The movie was good all the way through (unlike any recent disney  movies). I thought this movie was alot better than that dinosaur movie. I  came home and wrote this review and hope to see it again. Otherwise I will  wait till I buy it on DVD.,961718400,2,692,3.920863309352518
1270178,5,B00003CXJ4,"While children will enjoy the great animation and slapstick humor, much of  the dialog and plot is meant for adults. Children can understand the plot  and the obvious verbal jokes, but the comic references to older  prisoner-of-war movies will leave them wondering what the grown-ups in the  audience are laughing about. So while this is a great comedy for children,  adults who see it will probably laugh even more.
The plot is interesting,  and full of surprises, unlike typical predictable Hollywood scripts. (Also,  the surprises made sense; they weren't just plot-hole non-sequiters.) It's  not just a beautifully animated feature-length ad for Disney action figures  and soundtrack albums. We cared about the characters, and never knew what  would happen in the next scene.
The characters include chickens, both  heroic and ""chicken"", greedy rats, and villainous humans. Every  character with a speaking part has a clear personality. Don't miss it just  because you don't have any kids to drag you to the theater.",961718400,3,1019,5.254658385093168
1270179,5,B00003CXJ4,"The creators of the British animated classic ""Wallace and Gromit"" bring  their magic to a full length feature.  It's an ingenious little adventure  that follows the hopes and dreams of a chicken named Ginger (Julia  Sawalha). Her dream is to escape Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm. She claims she  can do it on her own but what bewilders her is that she is afraid for all  her fellow fowl within the coop. So their plan focuses upon all of them in  one huge jail-break. Ginger's prayers seem to be answered when a ""flying""  rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson) drops into the coop after escaping a  traveling circus. Meanwhile Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) develops a  plan to turn her little farm into a massive ""chicken pot pie"" factory  forcing Ginger and Rocky to teach all the others to fly before they become  pies.  What makes ""Chicken Run"" so ingenious was how the animators made  us want to be apart of the chicken world. We fall head over heals involved  with these chickens and their daily lives. Coupled with that involvement,  ""Chicken Run"" also cleverly delivers us into a ""prison breakout"" movie  filled with humor, and excitement. ""Chicken Run"" is a pure delight. For  many people this will be their first experimentation with a full length  animated feature involving clay. The clay for me helps reflect the tones  and dimensions of the characters. In some ways I think it aids a lot in the  audience's involvement in the chicken world.  Placing aside the  claymation and those magnificent machines, ""Chicken Run"" also brings back a  lot of classic Hollywood moments in the films setting. There are scenes  which remind us a lot of the classic World War 2 prison movies. Films like  the ""Great Escape"", ""Stalag 17"" and even the misadventures of ""Hogan's  Heroes"". What I liked about those film references here is that they weren't  here to poke fun at the films but to play homage. The references also aid  the audience in diving deeper into the film and its delight.  If you  remember ""Wallace and Gromit"" then you may recall all their huge machines  which helped enchant their everyday lives. From the rocket-ship to the  sheep shearing machine, ""Chicken Run"" has these kinds of machines which  have always amazed me in their transformation and assembly. How do they  dream up these wondrous machines? (4.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",961545600,13,2349,4.816582914572864
1270286,1,B00003CXJ4,Maybe I didn't watch the same film but it was chicken run on the front. The film seemed super old and really scary from the beginning. I thought it was so inappropriate for my son to watch it. We couldn't even keep going after the first 10 minutes so not sure if we just got the wrong movie in the case or what but this was no family film as the owners are trying to kill the chickens. Wasn't funny at all. But didn't watch after the first 10 minutes.,1511568000,,451,4.022222222222222

Chicken, ""fun"", you get it? what you see is what you get, just some good old chicken fun. It rolls off the tongue when you say it.

So, story. Mel Gibson plays up the laughs in chicken fun. He has a lot of fun moments when he plays the chicken. Get this guy with Kevin heart right? Haha

Kevin heart would have been great in chicken fun.

Overall, let's just say that chicken ""fun"" isn't chicken ""story"". What was the deal with making this about chickens? I felt like I wasn't even watching a movie and I was just losing my ability to consciously interpret reality. No more of this for me, I'll take chicken ""story"" any day.

1271306,5,B00003CXJ4,"First full length feature from Aardman studios in Bristol, Nick Park and Peter Lord pulled a wonderful display of claymation and British cinema.

An homage of some sort to Steve MacQueen's The Great Escape, Chicken Run takes the action into a farm down in 1950s England. Mr and Mrs. Tweedy's, an unpleasant couple who directs its chicken egg farm like a military camp. For every day, one egg per chicken. If one or many of them miss their weekly quota, the chop from the mistress and a feed down her tummy and her husband's. A situation so unpleasant that one of them, Ginger, has had enough and will try to do everything to get her mates and her out of this prison. Hatching mass escape attempts that always end up failing due to various circumstances. Losing hope until Rocky, an American Rooster, accidentally flies into their farm. With enough charm to attract the ladies and the talent to fly, his abilities then become the ultimate hope as he teaches them how to fly so that they can escape the Tweedies once and for all.

Now saying more about this movie would ruin its twists and fun. But I can tell you that Chicken Run was, when a kid, my first introduction to Aardman studio's work. And after seeing it, I understood how unlucky I was to have missed Wallace and Gromit on television when it used to pass. Indeed, the script is witty, full of that British irony I love to have a laugh. With even nods to Pop Culture through Military or Flying terms the characters employ, including one from Star Trek that I had quite a giggle. Also, it is a brilliant display of visual technique as the movie's animation quality is fluid and organised as you have tens of chicken working around while the camera travels around and records their progress, which must have been a headache of patience as stop motion is a very on-the-go process. Through the movie, you can see how Aardman really upped the bar for that movie in terms of backgrounds, sets, animations, and lighting effects. Therefore, their movie foreshadows the evolution of their stop motion animation they would pull in ""Shaun the Sheep"" or ""Animal Comforts"" on TV or even ""Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"".
And after seeing the movie on Blu-Ray, I cannot look back at a former DVD or video tape of that film when the HD image quality surpasses what my eyes used to see. Crisp image and sharp colors, HD is the best way to appreciate Claymation as its textural and manual attributes are more observable and a pleasure for the eyes. Both for viewers and for animation aficionados who might have learned a thing or two about a the craft like I did years ago.

On the Blu-Ray edition that comes from Path  which ironically has a Rooster as its emblem and is available on Amazon Canada, France and UK I got to get the French dubbing too and some nice bonus features on the movie's making of and even a commentary with Nick Park and Peter Lord. Though I have to warn American buyers that they (except the dubbing and the commentary) do not work on a North American Blu-Ray system. Which is a bummer as their Blu-Ray is Region Free. Nevertheless I hope that Dreamworks or the latest American distributors for that movie as Aardman broke ties with that studio will wake up and release a North American Blu-Ray for that marvellous British film with Imelda Staunton as Bunty, Mel Gibson as Rocky, Julia Sawalha as Ginger, and Miranda Richardson as the cruel Mrs. Tweedy. A fine choice really considering what she did on Sleepy Hollow.

In conclusion, a seventy-nine film that I feel hasn't lost its touch and which deserves all its praises and respect.",1439078400,,3620,4.606201550387597

1271590,5,B00003CXJ4,"A free-spirited American rooster played by Mel Gibson (who ironically is from Australia) finds himself injured and surrounded by British hens trying to escape from a tightly-controlled English chicken farm.

This claymation film is a classic in many ways.  It's classic in that it's put together by claymation geniuses Nick Park and Peter Lord (think Aardman Studios and ""Wallace and Grommit"").

This is a must-see for fans of WWII POW movies.  You will see many parallels to the big-budget movie ""The Great Escape"" and the made-for-TV film ""The Birdmen"", along with hints of ""Stalag 17"", etc.  \

The film features the somewhat dim-witted farmer, his militant/driven (commandant-like) wife- check out her boots, dogs guarding the fence perimeter, an optimistic escape leader, smuggler/scrounger rats and more.

Things go from bad to worse when the Farmer's wife, tired of earning ""minuscule profits"" invests in a business that will shift the farm from egg production to something much more sinister and lethal for the chicken inmates.  What can the chickens do?  Watch and see.

The writing is witty, the story line is fun, and character development is top-notch.

Studio: DreamWorks Pictures / Aardman Animations

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: This is a film for both children and adults. Chicken Run [2000] is a film that will easily be understood by all who watch it and it is a film by the same creators of ""Wallace and Gromitt,"" and equally entertaining. Chicken Run not only proves that Aardman Animations can deliver a full-length feature film with panache; and it offers genuinely superb entertainment as well.

Known to millions across the globe as the creator of the characters Wallace and Gromit, where a British inventor Wallace, with a penchant for inventing devices, especially in collaboration with his smart companion dog Gromit, Nick Park can no longer live in the obscurity he once enjoyed. It has been half-a-decade since the last Wallace and Gromit short reached audiences, and Nick Park has been quiet since then. The reason can be summed up in two words: Chicken Run. An ambitious, full-length motion picture employing Nick Park's signature ""Claymation"" style, albeit without Wallace or Gromit. Chicken Run represents an attempt by Nick Park to break free of his status as a cult figure and move into the mainstream. To that end, he has recruited some instantly recognisable voices, such as Miranda Richardson and Mel Gibson, and to voice his characters, Nick Park and Peter Lord struck a distribution deal with DreamWorks Pictures.

But life is tough if you're a chicken. It's especially tough if you're one of the chickens incarcerated in Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy run a failing Chicken Farm in a grim Yorkshire institution. run in the style of a Second World War POW camp, where the chicken fowls in question are lined up each morning for a military-style inspection. There's no apparent-pleasing sanitisation going on here: a few minutes into the film, one unlucky hen is being decapitated after falling behind in the laying stakes. The scene is made all the scarier for being depicted solely via suggestive shadow and a nasty chopping sound.

Things take an even darker turn, when the fearsome Mrs. Tweedy [Miranda Richardson] decides that her eggs aren't bringing in enough cash, and invests in a pie-making machine instead. A fantastically inventive monstrosity of slicing, spinning blades, gravy-spurting pipes and flaming ovens, it prompts one of the hens, the dim-witted Babs [Jane Horrocks] to observe, in one of the film's most-quoted lines: ""I don't want to be a pie... I don't like gravy.""

It's this balance between danger and wit that makes `Chicken Run,' the first feature-length animation from Wallace and Gromit makers Aardman Animations, such a treat for adults and children alike. The film, which follows Mrs. Tweedy's hens as they make a bid for freedom, is essentially The Great Escape with chickens, an engagingly ridiculous tagline, which the animation lives up to with charm and verve.

Julia Sawalha steals the show as Ginger, a plucky heroine, determined not to end up as a plucked heroine. Meanwhile, Mel Gibson is on brilliant form as American intruder and ""lone free ranger"" Rocky, who crash-lands on the farm with a cry of ""freeeeedom,"" is one of Chicken Run's many, many film references and in-jokes. The distinctive ""Claymation"" animation is as charming as it was when the animation film came out in 2000.

A naive hen, Babs [Jane Horrocks], who serves as a counterpoint to Ginger's desire to feel the grass under her feet, and two rodents, Fletcher [Phil Daniel] and Nick [Timothy Spall] who have an unusual passion for chicken eggs, make for some sharp and humorous moments, thanks to a clever screenplay by Karey Kirkpatric. There are many film references, including `The Great Escape,' `Stalag 17,' `Indiana Jones,' `Star Trek,' `Mission: Impossible' and many double meanings, which are good for a few thought-provoking laughs.

The very best thing about `Chicken Run,' however, is its exuberant final act, in which Mrs. Tweedy's demented metal beast of a pie machine is contrasted with the chickens' home-made aircraft, inspired by the exploits of ex-RAF mascot rooster Major Fowler [Benjamin Whitrow]. Old-fashioned, British home-spun inventiveness wins out, while the big, bad corporate-style machine collapses in a mad explosion of gravy, in a finale that manages to be beautifully silly and rather clever all at the same time.

The painstaking animation, done by moving clay models in miniscule amounts over time, comes off as a labour of love. The set design is incredible: from the chicken coop to the pie-making machine, Nick Park and Peter Lord (who also co-directs) and transports us to a world that not only goes beyond our reality but also the realm of traditional animation. Like with many other good animations, the voices, most of them British, are what make Chicken Run work so well. Every single voice is executed perfectly. I particularly liked the fact that the strongest character was a female and Julia Sawalha pulls off a Ginger, who deserves respect and admiration. `Chicken Run' is highly endearing, consistently attractive, and incredibly refreshing. While there's not one particular part in the film that had me rolling with laughter, I was constantly amused and at the end, I was filled with euphoria as the credits rolled up the screen.

Chicken Run is truly an unusual endeavour since, unlike every other animated motion picture reaching screens, its primary aim is not to astound viewers visually. In fact, with its old-fashioned approach to animation, it looks clunky in comparison to some of its competitors. Of course, that's part of Chicken Run' and its charm, but a lot of children will probably will not get the jokes and go right over their heads, whereas the more adult viewers will get the many in jokes. And, since a significant portion of the target audience will not accept a motion picture that doesn't offer start-to-finish action or eye-popping visuals, Chicken Run is beginning its theatrical life with a handicap. Hopefully, adults, won over by the smart-yet-uncomplicated script and charming execution, will encourage their offspring to see the film. Children will almost certainly enjoy the animation film if they give it a chance.

At the dawn of the third millennium, animation has become the domain of the United States and Japan, so it's a rare pleasure to see another movie industry enter into the fray. With Chicken Run, Park has taken all that was enjoyable about Wallace & Gromit, brought it into a barnyard, and extended it to feature length. Fans of the previous Aardman Animations shorts, which two have won Academy Awards and will undoubtedly shower Nick Park and Peter Lord with plaudits for what they have accomplished with this stunning animation film. All that remains is for audiences at large to discover the simple-but-engaging entertainment of Chicken Run.

Blu-ray Video Quality  I have to admit that it is hard to find an image transfer for an animated film recently that is not reference quality. But with the 1.77:1 anamorphic transfer of `Chicken Run' I can honestly say that this is among one of the best 1080p encoded transfers I have ever seen. There are no moments where the print becomes anything less than jaw-droppingly good. Detail and sharpness are both perfect, as is the use of colour in many of the daylight scenes. The black levels are done well with no grain at all, and there were no instances of shimmering or pixilation. This is one of the best transfers I have ever seen and another great effort by the DreamWorks Pictures and Aardman Animations team.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With what is becoming a tradition for DreamWorks Pictures and Aardman Animations, `Chicken Run' is presented with both French and English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtracks. While neither track is especially active, they each get the job done. The first half of the film is primarily dialogue and music driven, with the surrounds kicking in when the pie factory makes it appearance. There isn't a very noticeable difference between the French and English 5.1 DTS-HD surround versions mix and this animation film feature provides a bit more music in between the back surrounds and does a good job at enveloping the viewer. While not a showy mix, these tracks each offer clean and well-defined sound.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: When you view all of the extras, the French Subtitles appear automatically. To get rid of them you have to go to the SUBTITLES button on your Blu-ray remote and with the up arrow key button you can set it to off.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Directors Peter Lord and Nick  Park: Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park tell us in great detail why they produced the animation film like they did, especially in homage to the film `The Great Escape.' We also get to hear their love to all ""Claymation"" characters, and especially the in jokes for the chicken Edwina, which was in honour to the ex-Member of Parliament Edwina Curry [Health Minister], who had to resign from the British Government over the scandal over eggs, provoking outrage by saying most of Britain's egg production is infected with the salmonella bacteria. They also inform us why they chose specific actors to dub the voices for the ""Claymation"" characters. They also inform us that they had too many ideas for the film, but because of the time limited, they had ditch a lot of the ideas. What is so beautiful about this audio commentary is that the stereo separation is spectacular as each person is exactly in the left and right speakers. A must view audio commentary.

Special Feature Documentary: Fowl Play: The Making of Chicken Run [2000] [1080p] [4:3] [22:43] Here we get to see a very intimate and rare behind-the-scene look at the making of `Chicken Run,' and all involved in this 5 year project to bring this awesome Aardman Animations to the silver screen.

Finally, `Chicken Run' is another brilliant classic animation film from the mad geniuses at Aardman Animations, a quick confection fix that's consistently enjoyable and a non-stop treat for the eyes. The Blu-Ray looks great in 2D, but what a shame they could not do a 3D conversion, while the extras are impressive compared to what passes for bonus content on Blu-ray nowadays, and offers something for adults and children alike. Families looking for a fun time for everyone watching will find it here. Distinctly British and extremely wildly imaginative, Nick Park and Peter Lord's animation film is a triumph of solid writing and virtuoso animation. Highly Recommended!

1271928,4,B00003CXJ4,"Watching Peter Lord and Nick Park's glorious animation story of a group of chickens escaping from a repressive farm in 1950s Britain, one comes to understand how the script draws on a whole raft of classic war films of the period, including THE COLDITZ STORY (1955), STALAG 17 (1953), and most obviously THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963).

All of the elements are there, treated with a tongue-in-cheek reverence that makes the film a memorable experience. Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is the lead chicken, desperately trying to devise escape plans from the farm policed by Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) and his shrewish spouse (Miranda Richardson). The need to escape is paramount; all the chickens have to hope for instead is a life dedicated to laying eggs and a violent death by strangulation, as the Tweedies cook yet another tasty Sunday dinner. The only problem is that Ginger's task is hampered by the well-meaning yet rather clueless inmates, led by Babs (Jane Horrocks) and Mac (Lynn Ferguson). The entire group are 'supervised' (?) by the Brigadier Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), using the kind of Fifties Received Pronunciation accent that immediately recalls the war films of that period.

Enter Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson), a self-assured refugee from the circus, with a cockiness (pun intended) recalling Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Although eventually helping to create a successful escape, Rocky has to learn how to co-exist with a group of Brits, that requires both races to become more accommodating, and less xenophobic. The script allows for some jokes familiar to viewers acquainted with World War II history (all Americans are ""overpaid, oversexed, and over here.""

Although only just over eighty minutes long, the film is packed with incident as well as some really funny jokes. CHICKEN RUN is a joyous experience, a tribute both to the talents of animators and script-writers alike.",1419897600,,1903,5.15210355987055

1272302,5,B00003CXJ4,"We recently joined the backyard chicken movement and acquired 6 little golden balls of fluff. Ever since the chicks arrived I have been possessed with the desire to see this movie again. I saw it years ago and remembered it as being a cute animation, but not anything special. This time around I laughed myself silly.

This movie is hilarious. I thought the claymation would be annoying, but instead I found it charming. The British dialogue is incredibly witty, the characters are fantastic, and the storyline is simply endearing. And no, I'm not affiliated with the movie in any way or being paid to endorse it. I really did just LOVE this movie.

The pop culture references alone are brilliant. There are a whole bunch of them, but my favorites were the Star Trek references, especially the lines lifted straight from Star Trek IV. I mean, a Scottish ""engineer"" chicken who says things like, ""It's a Klingon, Cap'n! The engines can't take it!"" It's been a long time since I saw a movie so funny that I actually fell off the couch laughing, but this one delivered!

Highly recommend it, especially if you have your own little flock. Whoever made this movie spent a LOT of time around chickens - the behaviors and movements of the chickens are spot on. I spent most of the movie saying, ""OMG - that's EXACTLY how chickens are!!"" Seems like every flock's got a leader, a troublemaker, a complainer, and an underachiever - and after seeing this movie you'll recognize YOUR chickens immediately, lol! It's funny - all the time I was building the coop I was worried about predators getting in. Now after seeing this movie I'm a little paranoid that my girls are actually plotting to get out!",1401321600,2,1688,4.695945945945946
1272303,3,B00003CXJ4,"This movie is fun, but a bit morbid at times. Anytime you anthropomorphize an animal, to me, it becomes questionable when that animal then dies (in a G rated movie at least).

Enter Rocky, a rooster from a nearby circus who appears to be able to know how to fly, and Ginger is determined to learn that secret before it is too late. Strangely, it isn't Rocky who is destined to save them by teaching them to fly, because the secret to flight wasn't his to begin with. How will they escape?

1273008,4,B00003CXJ4,"Ardman Animations' films have a special look to them that's party the medium they started with (clay) and partly the wonderful graphic sensibility of their designers. There's no mistaking an Ardman film for the work of anyone else. The writers of Ardman's films also share a degree of wit you simply don't see in most animation. It's a mix of slapstick, wordplay, and reference to people and places that's just so much more clever than the simple jokes in the typical Hollywood product. Last, there's a real, palpable, affection for the characters in their films.

Chicken Run exemplifies all these traits. Great images, character development, plat, suspense... everything you want in a movie all packed into this tiny chicken yard. I smiled and laughed from beginning to end.",1364774400,,776,5.0625

Despite Mr. Mel Gibsons contribution, a charming and FUNNY movie from your favourite plasticine magicians. No match for Wallace & Gromit, because it was produced under Hollywood surveillance, and that's not good for the quirky British style that made Aardman famous.

But if you want something you will enjoy along with your kids, this is it. Now, chances are, your children will not understand the subtle homage to The Great Escape, but you don't need that inside knowledge to thoroughly enjoy this flick.

The action is fast-paced as the chickens plot their escape from the Tweedys' farm and the voice-acting does justice to a well written script. If you're not a fan of stop-motion animation you might want to give this a pass; I enjoy it for its low tech charm that carries off a high concept comedy really well. The musical number ""Flip, Flop, Fly"" would be hilarious on its own as a short three-minute sequence; wrapped up inside a short feature film, it's the icing on the cake. Tweedy's paranoia is some of the best writing, nd the interaction between the chickens is hilarious.",1350086400,,740,4.7

1273229,5,B00003CXJ4,"A very delightful film for all ages that takes the premise of Second World War prison camps in a poultry farm setting.  For those of us who've seen ""The Great Escape"", ""Stalag 13"" or ""Hogan's Heros"", this parody hits all the right marks, and then some.

Chickens are beset with the prospect of the couple that owns them will place their lives in peril to boost profits.  The chickens plot and scheme for a plan to live a better tomorrow, but fall flat until a gift from ""on high above"" is bestowed upon them.  Yet chance and fate have a twist, but provide a surprisingly good lesson in believing in oneself.

Gibson, for all of his off screen bi-polar antics, provides a good performance (even if he did demand that the entire British production team accommodate him by coming to LA for a couple of months).  The rest of the cast are top notch comedic actors from the UK, and deliver laughs like nothing before.

Excellent writing and timing as well as magnificent claymation by Nick Park and gang.

Lots of fun extras on the DVD, and other stuff too.

Definitely worth seeing by yourself or with the whole family.

The claymation is good-looking, the humor is appropriately sharp, the characters are memorable, and the music is at times satisfying. It's not preachy, and I think its main purpose is to entertain, and it succeeded very well. This is one animated film that I would recommend to both family and friends.

I recently bought this DVD so I could see a favourite movie over again.  It played well........but I could't access any of the extras!  This was a FOWL thing to happen on a DVD!

However, the PACKAGING of this DVD is, er.,,EGGSellent!
Perhaps because this CAN be considered a chilldrens' movie, the removal of this DVD, from it's case, is the easiest I have ever come across.  Press your finger in the place indicated....and two seconds later, wow -- your DVD is free(!) to put into your DVD player.  ALL future DVDs should come in similar packaging.  Doesn't look any more expensive to produce this type of DVD packaging, than similar cases, (which -- should women, (and men!) users ever band together in a class law-suit over broken finger-nails caused by difficult-to-open DVD packaging -- could easily bankrupt several studios.  (Only kidding??????)  Anyway, the DVD case that CHICKEN RUN comes in is DEFINITELY one for manufacturers to emulate!  Labels of ""Freedom opening"" DVD Packaging, (in honour of that found on the 'Chicken Run' DVD), should make the DVD-buying public SO happy, that those DVD packages that are made this way, will probably increase sales for their producers many times over....in amounts Mr. & Mrs. Tweedy could never have even imagined!

O R I G I N A L.....R E V I E W.........
I totally enjoyed this movie in the theatre!  So did my mom, (over 80 at the time.)  Neither of us knew that this was supposed to be a children's movie -- now we do.  The prevailing idea used to be that ""cartoons"", (animations), are just for children.  Then I got to thinking.....a ""cartoon"", (animation) film COULD be made of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".  It's not the ""medium"" used in a film that counts....it's the message.  (And, with apologies to Marshall McCluhan, medium and message really need NOT be the same.)

Reading the Amazon summary of this movie, brings back some very vivid
recollections.  Yes, indeed, this IS ""Stalag 17"" -- with chickens, (the first scenes even LOOK like a POW camp...complete with dogs and barbed wire, with our heros and heroines ensconsed in
""Chicken Coop 17"".  Some of the sight-gags are, indeed, best understood by adults -- and/or precocious teens who have seen ""Stalag 17"", and other movies hinted at, so cleverly, in ""Chicken Run"".  (At the beginning, our heroine, Ginger, tries to escape many times.  And each time she is put into solitary confinement.  Which is nothing compared to the sad fate that awaits ""eggless Edwina""...!  Later on, cruel Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy decide to change their farm from an chicken -egg-producing one........to a chicken-PIE-producing one!  These English chickens are really scared now....but a visitor from the US, (""Rocky the Rooster"", voiced by Mel Gibson), hopes to teach them to fly.  But...FLY???? Chickens CAN'T FLY!  Is the situation hopeless?  No, of course not....but not before danger and daring await and are required of all of the chickens....including Ginger and Rocky....who, at one point, find themselves in the new chicken-pie making machinery...and OVEN!!!!!  Yet Ginger, Rocky, and the other chickens and roosters, never give up trying to escape........

It's a great film.  So great that, when it was over, and my mom and I went to the nearby Burger-King for a snack, I forswore my usual chicken sandwhich, and opted for a salad instead!",1293062400,,3463,4.779461279461279
1273284,4,B00003CXJ4,"You really have to hand it to the British creative team of Peter Lord and Nick Park.  From their stop-motion masterwork craftsmanship on Wallace and Gromit to their computer generated animated feature Flushed Away, these guys have been dazzling fans with slick animation and memorable characters for decades.

Going back a full decade (summer of 2000), DreamWorks introduced the world to Chicken Run; an ambitious, full-length motion picture employing Park's signature claymation style featuring some instantly recognizable voices (such as Miranda Richardson and Mel Gibson).

The charming tale tells of a chicken farm in Yorkshire, England run by the Tweedy family: A militant wife and her bumbling husband.  However this isn't a sympathetic tale of the lives of some poor farmers so much as it is an escapism piece with WWII prison camp movie-appeal that focuses on the chickens living in oppression.

The tale centers mostly on Ginger, a hen with a dream that one day the chickens will be free from such torment as roll calls and egg quotas, free of the threat of being beheaded and eaten for dinner when egg production slowed with age

The film opens with a collage of her failed escape attempts, each one ending with her being sent to solitary confinement (a coal bunker in this case). Just when all hope seems lost to her cause, the answer to her prayers seems falls from the sky- literally. His name is Rocky, a highflying American red rooster and circus escapee. Sensing opportunity in his arrival to the coop, Ginger works out a bargain that she and the other hens will do their best to hide the fugitive performer in exchange for lessons on how to fly.  With the circus ringleader hot on his trail, Rocky has little choice but to accept the terms of the agreement.

Mrs. Tweedy, in the meantime, is growing tired of their modest egg farming lifestyle and devises a sinister plan to turn the chicken farm into a franchise. Her plan calls for the farm to switch from egg harvesting to full ought production of ""Mrs. Tweedy's Chicken Pies"", a process beginning with the installation of a monstrous automated pie-making machine.

In one fell swoop, Ginger's plans of escape go from wishful thinking to a matter of survival, a situation further complicated when it's learned Rocky isn't all he seems to be as well.

With a greater sense of the core of the tale, the question then becomes does it work? The answer is absolutely.  As a latecomer to the Aardman party myself, I have come to just adore Wallace and Gromit.  Chicken Run manages to capture many of the sensibilities and film reference cues that make the W&G so alluring.  It's not quite as funny as the latter but it works well for a self-contained property (after all they've had nearly 3 decades to perfect W&G).

The pacing is decent with a slight bog in the beginning middle that snowballs into a rewarding and action-heavy climax by the time all is said and done.

In all Chicken Run represents the first of many Aardman/ DreamWorks collaborations that would follow and with good reason.  Crisp visuals (interestingly enough, shot at 20 frames per second to save time and money rather than the standard 24 FPS), a solid vocal performance, humor catered to adults, and what can only be described as Aardman charm, all add up to a worthy investment of both time and money.",1290124800,,3341,4.794425087108014

Nick Park and the crew at Aardman Studios have produced another wonderful family comedy utilizing the unique art of clay animation.  Like their other films, it features lots of madcap action sequences and homages to classic films (in this case, prison standards such as ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"").  Children and adults can watch together with equal enjoyment.  Parents, there is one fairly shocking scene early on when a chicken is slaughtered.  The killing is off-screen, but there is no doubt about what has happened and it may be scary for young children.  At any rate, it certainly demonstrates why our heroes are so desperate to get away.

1273440,4,B00003CXJ4,"After their huge success with Creature Comforts and the Wallace & Gromit shorts, Nick Park and Peter Lord ventured out into the world of full-length features. Using the same style of animation that they'd established with W&G, they decided to create a spoof of old wartime prison escape films. The result is the featherbrained caper known as Chicken Run.

Life on the Tweedys' farm was never easy. Mrs. Tweedy was a cruel woman and her husband a paranoid fool. He insisted that the chickens were planning elaborate escapes. And he was right. A plucky hen named Ginger was organizing the other hens in repeated attempts to fly the coop. But her plans were being foiled time and time again. Until one day a rowdy American rooster named Rocky came soaring into their mundane lives. They had grown tired of being forced to lay eggs and being killed for food if they failed to produce. Maybe this rooster could teach them to fly. But he wasn't what he appeared to be. Meanwhile Mrs. Tweedy had become impatient and discovered that she could make greater profits if she simply killed the chickens. She buys a horrible pie-making machine and this urges the chickens to unite and form a proper escape plan. Everything seems to be looking up until Rocky disappears and Ginger is once again forced to save her companions.

Chicken Run has much of the same visual style as other Aardman films and shorts, but it's unique for its humor, which is more accessible in America than most of their previous television endeavors. The voice cast is fantastic, especially Mel Gibson (before he lost his mind) as Rocky. All in all, Chicken Run is a whimsical adventure for children of all ages.

The DVD features a commentary track, two behind the scenes featurettes, a hilarious screaming chicken Panic Button, and much more including facts about the film, which are hidden throughout the menus.

Mr. Tweedy is hen pecked by Mrs. Tweedy.  The chickens are constantly in fear of not laying enough eggs, which is a sure trip to the chopping block.

Into the lives of the chickens flies (literally) Rocky the rooster, voiced by Mel Gibson.  Rocky is an inspiration for the chickens and they want to learn to fly so that they can escape from the farm.  Of course, Rocky can't really fly, but he manages to make a series of excuses to keep the chickens from learning that he can't fly.

Mrs. Tweedy has plans of her own.  She buys a large machine that turns chickens into chicken pies.  This nefarious instrument looks ominous, and spurs Ginger the chicken to take responsibility for everyone's escape.  However, she has to plan the escape without Rocky, who left the farm just before his deception was uncovered.

Now the chickens are in a race with Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy.  Will the chickens find a way to escape before the Tweedys complete their chicken pie machine, or will everyone be in the soup?  The hilarious ending of this excellent movie will give everyone a smile.

""Chicken Run"" is a clever movie that managed to win 19 awards around the world and another 22 nominations.  Most animated movies today are digital, but this movie uses stop-motion.  The stop-motion filmography is superb.  Especially well-done is the machinery.  The movie is an homage to several movies, most particularly ""The Great Escape,"" but also to ""Stalag 17.""  The movie also gives a nod to several other movies.

1273525,5,B00003CXJ4,"Chicken and English accents - what a great combination!  This is a wonderful, fun and entertaining movie that keeps even the most ""mature"" adult giggling with delight.  The story is simple and the ending obvious, but who cares when the dialogs and the humor are so wonderful.  The animation is striking with the chicken and human characters made out of clay, while some of the nature scenes seem truly realistic.  And who would have thoughts that chickens can have such cute and interesting personalities.  There is the heroic chicken, the fearful chicken, the nerdy chicken, the dumb chicken and two very amusing roosters.  It is truly enjoyable to see the chickens argue about Americans vs British, working hard to lay eggs and meet their work quota, dancing the night away and searching for their own communal piece of chicken heaven.  Many of the themes are taken from ""classic"" escape movies, such as the spirit to escape together and leave no one behind, the various attempts to do so, the planning, the great idea, the nerve-wrecking escape that almost does not seem to work and finally the enjoyment of having worked together to find chicken freedom at a bird sanctuary.  (I hope I did not give away too much, but this movie is truly about dialogs and adapted scenes.)

I would caution that adults watch this movie together with their children, as there are a couple scenes referencing death and the fear of death.  One chicken is killed and later seen as bones on the dinner tables.  The other scary part is a chicken pie machine that looks like a big living monster and creates all sorts of noises, has fire chambers and levers that seem to be over-sized and impossible to escape for any chicken that is stuck in it.  This is definitely a child friendly movie, but adults may want to speak about some of the scenes with their children.

1273527,4,B00003CXJ4,"Old fashioned entertainment, superbly crafted by the Lord & Park duo.

I liked it even a bit more than their great ""Wallace and Gromit"" series.

The voices are extraordinarily cast, the story never looses rhythm and

music shows how much they love cinema. There are MANY ""movies for

children which also cater for adults"". Probably too many. This one is

my favourite, and I like the genre without being an absolute fan.

You may not know ""the great escape"" and all the other films they quote,

but you do ""get the picture"", and quite a few laughs. It has a couple

of great chase sequences, and the villain being a grim and masculine

woman adds a different flavour.

My favourite character is ""Ginger the instigator chicken"". What a great

leader and motivator she is! This movie could be used for Management courses :). When I saw this film the first time, I thought

it was TERRIFIC. The ""Britons vs Yanks"" tension, dialects (Scottish!), etc. Now, right after the 2nd time, and about 5 years

later, I saw it with joy but not amazed. I don't think I'd buy it,

better stick to ""Ice age"" if I had to choose one ""film for children""

for a potential ""desert island"" situation.

As usual, there are many levels of analysis. You could make parallels

with Nazi films, industrial society in which we're all ""caged"" even

race and gender relationships. Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana"" (New York,

NY USA) from Amazon is great when she writes on the meaning of freedom

and how ""films for children"" do have a meaning for us, world-weary

adults. I just won't get into that this time for I rather leave this

fun film unanalyzed. For some reason I feel like Distant Voyageur

""Nicholas Computer"" (Io) from Amazon at that.

1273528,4,B00003CXJ4,"I am six years late on this but having finally been album to watch ""Chicken Run"" just recently, I have to say that this is overall an excellent and cute film that brilliantly uses the clay animation technique that I long forgot about for many years.

The story is really great to follow as it is about a large heard of chickens on an egg farm that are under the watchful eye of a cruel old woman as well as her bumbling stooge farmer. The protagonist is an English chicken called Ginger who longs for freedom from the austere confines of the egg farm and willing to lead the other chickens from certain death at the human's dinner table. After all, that's how chickens go from rummaging birds to the delicious food that we eat on the dinner table. However, the chickens on this farm though refuse to endure this fate quietly and figure out how to plan their escape to freedom. In the midst of all this a boorish but handsome American rooster from a circus crashes onto the farm and makes a small mess of things. Mrs. Tweedey though aims to turn the farm into a profitable pie-factory that will involve the entire chicken flock and it's a perpetual race against the clock in order to make it out of the egg farm for good.

 Though far from my favorite animation movies, ""Chicken Run"" I felt was a very good and highly enjoyable little movie that sadly flew over the radar for almost six years until now. Included are some excellent spoofs of certain scenes from the Indiana Jones saga. While it's not necessarily a movie that warrants a really large review from this writer, I really find ""Chicken Run"" to be a very well-done clay animation movie that is worth checking out.",1146787200,2,1673,4.478688524590164

The dramatic detail is very much like what Bluth did before the big studios eviscerated his work ( LAND BEFORE TIME  as an example, even though it is still  great work); and the dramatic light and shade works superbly. The story is basically the Great escape with Chickens, but it works superbly, and very much in a British fashion, plus a dose of Scottish  thrown in ( with a carefully done reference to Star Trek's Scotty at the denoument).

The extras are good but in some respects a bit thoughtless. Whilst the best stuff  is clearly focused on the kids, especially the great Chicken Panic Button, there are two features done by different networks, NBC and HBO, and they both use basically the same material.

Also, with regards to the commentary, it is detailed, and talks much about the creation of the film, very enlightening, even too much so ... if you think that this film was done purely by claymation as in earlier Aardman works, think again; the role that CGI plays is significant, but the commentary says that it could have been done without CGI, but would have taken another year.

1273656,5,B00003CXJ4,"You never know what to expect from an animated movie. It can be a great one or it can be a trial to get through. This one was a delight.

The story involves a British chicken farm. The hens are kept as prisoners, much as POWs during WWII. They are always plotting to escape and never seem to make it. Then one day, a rooster flies into the compound. He is a refugee from a circus and lets the hens believe that he can really fly. They want him to teach them the same trick so they can escape. Escape is important for a few reasons. Chickens who fail to lay are used for other purposes, such as supper. It gets worse, the greedy farm owner invests in some machinery to make chicken pies. Everyone is then scheduled for a one way trip and escape becomes a must.

If the story sounds morbid, it certainly could have been but it is not played that way. It is played in fun and this comes through.

The film owes a great debt to THE GREAT ESCAPE. Similarities to the WWII epic abound and make the film even more interesting for those who have seen this classic.

You can't talk about the acting in this one. It's all animation but the animation is first rate even if it does not push the margins in this day and age.

In any case, the story of the rebellious chickens in a concentration camp like atmosphere is hilarious, as are the various characters.  The stiff upper lip British are lampooned, especially Mr. Tweedy and his evil wife.

The voices come from a wide variety of stars and character performers--Ginger is played by Julia Sawahla, the long-suffering Saffron from ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" and she's joined by Jane Horrocks, who played the aptly named Bubble in another of the chicken roles.

Mel Gibson is hilarious as the American rooster called on to help save the day, and among the others, Timothy Spahl plays Tweedy (you'll see him in ""Lemony Snicket,"" ""Still Crazy"" and numerous other films).

The animation is again fantastic;  the attention to detail, and the realism of the scenes is wonderful.

1273659,5,B00003CXJ4,"I originally had little interest in seeing this film, but  my daughter, having already seen it, told me it was terrific and suggested that we watch it together. While I was not overly optimistic about enjoying this film, not withstanding the critical raves, as I am not a devotee of animated films, I looked forward to just hanging with my daughter. Yet, as soon as the film began, I became wholeheartedly engaged by it.

What an absolutely delightful film! It is funny, irreverent, and has a coherent plot which revolves around a group of English and Scottish hens trying to escape from a chicken farm owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. Mrs. Tweedy, by the way, makes Cruella De Ville look like Mother Theresa.

Anyway, the chickens are being organized by a hen named Ginger and exhorted to make a run for it before it is too late. You see, they all lay eggs for the Tweedys, but the minute a hen has a dry spell, she ends up as the Tweedy's dinner. To keep from ending up as a roaster, they must escape from the Tweedy's chicken farm. Time is of the essence, as the Tweedys have decided that, rather than selling eggs, they should just sell chicken pot pies.

Enter Rocky Roads, a so called flying rooster, who ends up in their chicken coop when he unceremoniously crash lands on their turf, after escaping from the circus. Rocky, a brash and cocky American, is inveigled by Ginger to teach them all to fly. He does his best, knowing, however, that it will never happen. Still, this provides for some hilarious scenes. Meanwhile, a spark seems to have been struck between Rocky and Ginger. After saving Ginger from becoming part of the inaugural pot pie, Rocky flies the coop, so to speak.

What happens next is audacious and heartwarming. It is also quite funny. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and a sense of humor. The magic of claymation is a wonder to behold, as it creates three dimensional animated figures that make you want to reach out and touch them. The cast for the voices of these animated creatures is terrific, as they go a long way towards endowing these animated characters with some very human qualities. Watch the film.

Then they realize there is more than freedom at stake. Their very lives are on the line unless they break free. It may be possible for one or two to get away, but the plan is to leave no one behind. Imagine the cast of characters: the super courageous prisoner, the instigator, the intellect, the creative engineer type, the flake, the old soldier. Every time they attempt an inventive, seemingly effective method to reach freedom - they're caught. And the same brave, never-say-die prisoner always pays by spending time in solitary confinement. Then time runs out and the pressure is on as never before. Have you seen the film? ""The Great Escape? No! It's ""Chicken Run.""

 Sure. It really works. Just substitute a bunch of sympathetic chickens, and a rooster, for Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson. Stay with me now. The WWII Nazi prison camp is a chicken farm where the poor poultry are forced to lay their daily quota of eggs or they become Sunday dinner. The Tweedys (the couple who run the farm) make terrific Nazis, especially when they decide to turn the farm into a chicken pot pie factory. They're going to cook their goose...err, chickens. ""Rocky the Flying Rooster,"" (known as Steve McQueen in a former life), arrives just in time to give the hens hope.

 This is not your typical animated cartoon film. ""Chicken Run"" is animated using actual clay figures in stop-motion. This procedure is much more complicated than drawn animation. Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park are experts in the field and the effects are wonderful. The sets and backdrops are extremely detailed and have the gray, weathered look of a POW camp.

 If one peels away a few layers, this is more than a comical remake of the Great Escape meets Stalag 17. When the instigator chicken, Ginger, tries to motivate her coop-mates to escape, she urges them to change their entire way of thinking. She asks them to think out-of-the-box. To think beyond changing location. For chickens who, unlike human prisoners, have never experienced life outside chicken wire, the concept of green grass that feels good under their claws, is as new as the idea of what it means to be free.

 I can't imagine anyone not enjoying ""Chicken Run."" It truly is a film for kids of all ages.

1273748,5,B00003CXJ4,"Peter Lord and Nick Park's CHICKEN RUN (2000) is truly a film for all ages. Produced by Mel Gibson, it is about how a stray American rooster, Rocky (voiced by Gibson himself) comes to the aid of a group of chickens at the sinister Tweedy Chicken Farm, who are trying to escape before they can be made into pies. On its surface, this story would appear to be rather simplistic; however, it is witty, funny, entertaining, intelligent and interesting. In short, it is everything that most G-rated animated films aren't today. Peter Lord and Nick Park, co-creators of the popular British Claymation ""Wallace and Gromit"" series, have outdone themselves in crafting a feature film that is both visually stunning and extremely well-written.
CHICKEN RUN makes use of numerous film references, especially from THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963), STALAG 17 (1953) and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981). All are cleverly interwoven with the story.  The vocal performances are excellent, especially from Julia Sawalha as Ginger (the hen leader), Jane Horrocks as Babs (Ginger's bubbleheaded best friend) and Miranda Richardson as the evil Mrs. Tweedy.  If the names of the first two (and their voices) sound familiar to you, no doubt you'll recognize that they are Saffy and Bubble, respectively, from ""Absolutely Fabulous""; arguably the greatest British comedy series of all time.  As for the male voices in CHICKEN RUN: Tony Haygarth is hilarious as the dimwitted Mr. Tweedy, the always-great (and Mike Leigh favorite) Timothy Spall is the hapless Nick and, of course, Mel Gibson is funny and charming as Rocky 'The Flying Rooster'.
CHICKEN RUN has modern Claymation that is absolutely amazing compared to the old shows such as ""Davey and Goliath"" or ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" or ""A Year without Santa Claus,"" etc.  To cop a phrase, this isn't your dad's Claymation! Instead, it is a wonderful feast for eyes both young & old, with humor that adults can appreciate.

The film follows a group of chickens in an egg farm. Slowly, they disappear by the farmer's axe as they stop producing eggs. The chickens continually try to escape, but to no avail. Eventually, Mrs. Tweedy the farm's owner, decides to get out of the egg business, and into the chicken (pot) pie business.
The chickens get wind of her plan, and decide they must escape at all costs. Their salvation, literally, flies over the fence one day as Rocky, voiced by Mel Gibson, enters their lives. He claims that if they hide him in their coops, he'll teach them how to fly so they can get over the fence to safety.

There are more than a few references to the war prison genre, like the film Stalag 17, but also references to Indiana Jones, Star Trek., and Saturday Night Fever.
The story centers on Tweedy's Chicken Farm, where a young, English chicken named Ginger, voiced by Julia Sawalha of Ab Fab fame,  is trying to rally her compatriots to escaping.  While on the farm, they come into contact with the American rooster, Rocky, voiced by Mel Gibson.  Thinking that he can fly, Ginger implores him to teach the other chickens to fly so that they can literally flee the coop.
Along the way are the characters of Mr. Tweedy and the rats, which are always good for a laugh.

It was hailed by critics all around the country with Roger Ebert saying it was ""magical entertainment for all ages!""  And it's true.  Like the other successful movie at that time Shrek, Chicken Run was delightful and heartwarming, funny for the kids though had enough jokes that only adults understood.
Ginger, one of the chickens on the evil Mrs. Tweedy's farm, is probably the smartest one of the bunch.  She's always thinking up plans of escape because one by one the chickens are being used for food by Mrs. Tweedy.  However, all her plans always fail.  So when Mrs. Tweedy decicdes to take all the chickens and turn them into pies to become wealthy, Ginger gives up hope.  However, soon enough, Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson), the flying rooster, comes and says that he can teach the chicken to fly.  Will it work?  Find out.

1273920,4,B00003CXJ4,"When I saw this film in the theater, it didn't appeal to me as much as it does now (I currently own this DVD). This is one of those films that takes some time, and a couple of viewings, to really appreciate. The claymation takes some getting used to, as do the British sensibilities (and accents). But be warned. It grows on ya.

 ""Chicken Run"" is one of the funniest, and definately the most charming, film of the year. The story is almost flawless, and the animation is amazing. There's no question this film will do the same for claymation what Toy Story did for computer animation. The most likable character is Babs, the charmingly dim-witted friend of Ginger, the main character. She will crack you up every time she speaks.

 The DVD has excellent video and audio (DTS!). The extra features are welcomes bonuses, although the commentary is a little dry.

 ""Chicken Run"" is a homage to an old Steve McQueen film called ""The Great Escape,"" which was made in the 60s. Many of the visual gags in ""Chicken Run"" are taken directly from ""The Great Escape"" so it's worth a rental.

 Nick Park, the animator, is also the creator of the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts. He received some awards for them. If you liked ""Chicken Run,"" you have to check those out.",1017792000,2,1253,4.5625
1273921,5,B00003CXJ4,"Sometimes a movie comes along that is entertaining to all age groups. I am most impressed by these because this is one trick I could never master. I suspect that the creators of such a picture are rare human beings who can manage to be a child and an adult simultaneously. This is different from never having grown up, for the world is full of people who managed never to do that.
The movie in question is Chicken Run, written and directed by Peter Lord and Nick Parks, two enormously eccentric guys from Great Britain. Their chosen field is clay animation, an arduous and difficult procedure in which soft clay figures 'move' through stop motion photography. Chicken Run is the most ambitious project ever undertaken using this process. The results are spectacular.
The plot device is ingeniously simple. Think of a chicken farm as a prisoner of war camp. Think of the captive chickens as forever plotting their escape. In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, owners of the farm, and their dogs are the prison guards. One chicken in particular, Ginger, is the trouble maker, the one forever hatching plots to escape. Her ideas are often good, but her comrades are forever screwing the plans up in hilarious ways. A new urgency arrives when Mrs. Tweedy decides that she'd make a lot more money from chicken pot pies than she ever did from selling eggs. A new arrival, a rooster named Rocky Rhodes, gives new hope. It appears that he can fly. Maybe he can teach the chickens how to fly, too.
What makes Chicken Run fly is the fact that it is more than a technical achievement. The story is very funny and very well told. It has some gentle things to say about hope, persistence and survival. The movie is full of delightful, memorable characters. Even the Tweedys, the villains, are amusing. They are everyone's memory of a school teacher who was strict and mean because he or she was so inept and so thoughtless. There are moments that are thrilling, as well as a few that are terrifying. Lord and Park spent a great deal of time working on the scary scenes, trying to lessen their impact on small children. I think they succeeded, and I can recommend the movie for kids as young as four.",1016409600,2,2183,4.6

Our aviary friends haven't had much luck in animated form (where's The Road Runner when we need him?  Beep Beep,) and thankfully ""Run"" does have a few stunning sequences.
There are also some moments of sweet inspiration, cute kid-friendly messages, and reasonably good voice-overs.

Since parents of teenagers know that moments of togetherness are somewhat limited by their offspring's desire to be with their friends, I grabbed at the opportunity to have a shared mother/daughter activity, however sedentary.
While I was not overly optimistic about enjoying this film, not withstanding the critical raves, as I am not a devotee of animated films, I looked forward to just hanging with my nineteen year old daughter in the comfort of our home. Yet, as soon as the film began, I became wholeheartedly engaged by it.
What an absolutely delightful film! It is funny, irreverent, and has a coherent plot which revolves around a group of English and Scottish hens trying to escape from a chicken farm owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. Mrs. Tweedy, by the way, makes Cruella De Ville look like Mother Theresa.
Anyway, the chickens are being organized by a hen named Ginger and exhorted to make a run for it before it is too late. You see, they all lay eggs for the Tweedys, but the minute a hen  has a dry spell, she ends up as the Tweedy's dinner. To keep from ending up as a roaster, they must escape from the Tweedy's chicken farm. Time is of the essence, as the Tweedys have decided that, rather than selling eggs, they should just sell chicken pot pies.
Enter Rocky Roads, a so called flying rooster, who  ends up in their chicken coop when he unceremoniously crash lands on their turf, after escaping from the circus. Rocky, a brash and cocky American, is inveigled by Ginger to teach them all to fly. He does his best, knowing, however, that it will never happen. Still, this provides for some hilarious scenes.  Meanwhile, a spark seems to have been struck between Rocky and Ginger. After saving Ginger from becoming becoming part of the inaugural pot pie, Rocky flies the coop, so to speak.
What happens next is audacious and heartwarming. It is also quite funny. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and a sense of humour. The magic of claymation is a wonder to behold, as it creates three dimensional animated figures that make you want to reach out and touch them. The cast for the voices of these animated creatures is terrific, as they go a long way towards endowing these animated characters with some very human qualities. Watch the film. You will find yourself totally engrossed in the great eggscape!",994032000,5,2541,4.667410714285714
1274211,4,B00003CXJ4,"Early in Chicken Run, Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) lays down the law. ""No chickens escape from Tweedy's farm"". Not a very nice man. But attempt after attempt the chickens can't escape from Tweedy's farm.
Every attemt fails until Rocky (Mel Gibson) an American rooster shows up. When of the chickens named Ginger (Julia Sawalha) wants to leave the farm for good! And she hopes to escape by having Rocky show the chickens how to fly. Rocky has a secret that he was shown being shot out of an cannnon and he can't fly.
He is on the run from the circus. Mr. Tweedy can't get his wife named Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) to believe the chickens are escaping from the farm. Every day the Tweedy count to see how many eggs the chickens lay. And when they can't lay eggs anymore the Tweedys will kill them. When any of the chickens don't lay an egg because she was thinking more of escaping they wait until the last minute before telling the other chickens. Mrs. Tweedy decide she has had enough of this and start making chicken pies. Made out of her chickens! When Mr. Tweedy asks hows it work Mrs. Tweedy tells him to get a chicken and she'll show him.
Mr. Tweedy picks Ginger and Rocker saves her from the chicken pies machine. They show a tag called Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Pies to the other chickens and none of the others doesn't want to be a pie. While shopping for father's day, Mom talked me into getting this on dvd. Rent this first to see if you like it, if you do then buy it on video or dvd. There is aslo a rooster named Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) who was a rooster in the R.A.F (The Royal Air Force). And from when Rocky arrives on the farm to when Ricky saves Ginger life, he I guess doesn't trust Rocky.
So after Rocky leaves Ginger decides they will escape by making a crate. There is a chicken named Babs (Jane Horrocks) who knits. What are they supposed to do knit their way out of Tweedy's farm? While this is going on Rocky sees an ad for Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken pies which aslo says ""the woman's touch.""

For ultimate appreciation, watch the classic, The Great Escape first (which Chicken Run spoofs with great results). Then, put in Chicken Run and marvel and laugh for the next 83 minutes.  Chicken Run covers smart and spirited Ginger the Hen's attempt to light a fire -- or avoid having a fire lit --under her chicken coop comrades. The chickens live with the evil Tweedys -- Mr. and Mrs. -- who've done some figuring and decided that eggs bring ""miniscule profits,"" so it's time to start marketing ""chicken pie.""  Only Ginger sees the danger and spurs the other chickens to a coop coup -- to absolutely hilarious effect.

1274306,3,B00003CXJ4,"I had never seen any of the Wallace and Gromit cartoons before Chicken Run.  Still haven't.  And yet my expectation meter for Chicken Run was unreasonably high.  You see it had been a good couple of months for animation what with Toy Story 2 and Tarzan recently released and I was eagerly awaiting the next critical lauded piece of artwork.  So I get Chicken Run.  Ehh!  It was good but relative to its competition, it was a disappointment.
Chicken Run begins with a fantastic sequence.  A brave little chick desperately trying to escape the trappings of her coop.  Her elaborate ideas are stopped again and again and again.  This happens over the opening credits and it's almost too good.  The film never recovers from such a blindingly brilliant introduction.
A film involving escape should not waste its escape ideas in the first five minutes because the rest of the film is lacking in originality.  It gets a shot in the arm with the arrival of Mel Gibson's charming rooster.  Some of his lines are classics and there are some neat supporting characters.  Jane Horrocks is a real crowd pleaser as the constantly happy hen and the war reminiscing rooster is splendidly old school.  However, the lead is very bland.  She tries to escape and we know she desperately wants to, but that's as far as her character goes.  She's too one-dimensional.  A disappointingly routine character especially against the eccentricites of the supporting cast.
Chicken Run is a children's film and it works as such.  The kids love this animation especially because it seems so new, so amazingly unreal.  However, parents looking for an escape adventure would be better off checking out a Steve McQueen movie or something along those lines.",986860800,,1722,4.875862068965517

This is a film that we can sit down and watch with the children, even though alot of the British humor is lost on them.  It seems that I never fail to ""find something new"" each time that I watch it, and the humor never grows old.  It is an amazing animated tale and one that we will enjoy over and over again through the years, as it ""grows"" with our children's comprehension.

1274308,4,B00003CXJ4,"I first found out about `Chicken Run' in a movie theater, when they played the coming-attractions trailer. My first glance at those claymation figures, with the hotdog-shaped mouths and square white teeth, told me this had to be Nick Park's work. Which was just about all the recommendation I needed.
English animator Park is the creator of the `Wallace and Gromit' cartoons; misadventures of a clueless but lovable cockney inventor, and his very patient dog. So far there's three installments in that series; `A Grand Day Out', `The Wrong Trousers', and `A Close Shave.' All are notable for being entertaining fare for both children and grownups. The plots are original, there's no end of amusing little details tucked into the sets, and Peter Sallis, the actor voicing Wallace, does a fine job of it (Gromit never speaks, but, with his drolly understated facial expressions, he hardly needs to.)
It is to Dream Works' credit that they apparently let Park & Company follow their own vision in the making of `Chicken Run.'  As other reviewers have noted, the plot is essentially a feathered version of 'The Great Escape', with dashes of very British wit stirred in. The opening scenes are of Ginger, the indomitable hen (voiced by Julia Sawalha), making repeated attempts to extricate herself and her fellow egg-laying prisoners from the stalagesque `Tweedy's Chicken Farm.' Every effort fails, but, despite being repeated punished with confinements the dumpster, Ginger won't give up.
Things promise to get worse; the sinister Mrs. Tweedy (voice of Miranda Richardson, giving Cruella DeVille a run for her money) decides the farm would make bigger profits producing chicken pies, rather then eggs. Just in time, Rocky, an apparently fledged American rooster, literally drops into the picture. Ginger promptly declares him their best hope for escape; surely a Flying Rooster can teach the hens to soar out of their captivity. Rocky, who's on the lam from the circus and needs somewhere to hide, reluctantly agrees- but is he really on the level?
Of course, we all know he'll come around sooner or later (he's got Mel Gibson's voice, after all.) Likewise, we know these determined barnyard fowl will triumph, after dealing with a succession of obstacles and setbacks. What makes this movie work is the abundance of funny and/ or visually interesting bits along the way. There's Fowler, the fussy, aged ex-military rooster who's openly mistrustful of the newcomer (""Those Yanks! Always late for the wars!"") There's a wise-cracking pair of opportunistic rats, maneuvering to make a profit off the chicken's efforts. There's refs to Bugs Life, Indiana Jones, and Star Trek, among other things (these are fleeting, so keep your eyes & ears peeled.).There's an exuberant sequence where Rocky teaches the hens to dance, a merrily nightmarish one where he and Ginger struggle to escape the bowels of the pie-making apparatus, and a Final Confrontation to rank with the best of `em.
In short; despite the Schindler's Birds subtext, `Chicken Run' is a genuinely Fun Ride. Don't be afraid to let all but the most sensitive kids view this video.",984873600,2,3133,5.107212475633529
1274309,5,B00003CXJ4,"Chicken Run
Score: 97/100
Chicken Run is not only the film that assures that the claymation way of filmmaking will never go out of style, but it puts Nick Park and Peter Lord as one of the top directors of our times, and they've only made 4 films, all which have managed easily to fit into my top 50! That is a pretty remarkable achievement for animated filmmaking.
Having been hopelessly repressed and facing eventual certain death at the chicken farm where they are held, Rocky the rooster (Mel Gibson) and Ginger the chicken (Julia Sawahla) decide to rebel against the evil Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson), the farm's owners. Rocky and Ginger lead their fellow chickens in a great escape from the murderous farmers and their farm of doom.
Acting wise, the film is excellent, a bunch of voice talents alone make the film worth seeing, Julia Sawalha and Mel Gibson bring their claymation chickens alive, and Lynn Ferguson uses her voicing expression awesomely as geeky chicken Mac. But here it is actually Absolutely Fabulous' Jane Horrock's that steals the show as the hilarious knitty witty chicken Babs, not to mention Miranda Richardson's delightful voice-over performance as an evil character. But it comes as no surprise that the brilliant clay chickens and stunning set-decoration over-take everything else that is excellent about the film, and everything about it is excellent.
An animated masterpiece, Chicken Run is witty, eye-catching and hugely enjoyable. A must-see!",984787200,,1507,5.105263157894737

1274400,5,B00003CXJ4,"""Chicken Run"" may very well be the best movie of 2000, and most certainly the funniest and most awe-inspiring. It contains all the needed elements to make a children's movie, but what makes it so much better is that it still has a high adult-pleasing quotient, using lots of wit and humor that most small children would not pick up on. The story is as exciting and entertaining as any action movie this year, and the characters inspire pure humor and laughs. The movie is supposed to make you laugh, and it hit the spot for me.
The story is strikingly similar to ""The Great Escape,"" the 1963 film in which a group of P.O.W.s try different tactics to escape a Nazi prison camp. ""Chicken Run"" takes the basic structure of that film and replaces its protagonists with poultry, the prison with a poultry farm, and the Germans with a chicken farmer whose greed for money is the danger the chickens may face. It's a basic remastering of the plot that incorporates a fresh plot full of humor and delight in its characters and development.
The movie centers around Mrs Tweedy's chicken farm, and the antics of one chicken, Ginger, as she tries various ways of escaping the clutches of their devilish owner. One by one, the plans fail, but they become more determined to escape when one of their own is taken to be killed because she laid no eggs. As the chickens begin to panic, in comes Rocky, an American rooster who finds himself surrounded by swooning English chickens that can't wait for him to demonstrate how they can escape by flying out of the coop. There's only one thing: Rocky doesn't really know how to fly, but is afraid of telling the chickens for fear that Ginger will turn him in to the circus he escaped from. This is the point at which the movie picks up a lot of momentum and comedy, which mostly involves the plans of escape. Once the chickens realize the awful truth that they are going to be turned into pot pies, the race is on to try and find an escape route from the coop.
I found myself laughing at so many different things this movie has to offer, but mostly at the irony of the chickens themselves. Chickens, in reality, are not smart creatures, but the movie portrays them as intelligent and quite witty, coming up with plans of escaping that end in hilarious results. Each separate character has his own stereotype of a different social attitude: Ginger embodies determination and strength, which holds the rest of the flock together. Rocky is the cocky rooster who knows he can get away with a lot just by making the ladies swoon, but he ultimately ends up a good guy. Babs is the anti-intelligence of the group, and it is her simple-mindedness that makes for most of the laughs in the movie, while Mac is the logical thinker who wants to make sure every aspect of each plan will work.
More of the laughs come with the situations the chickens get involved in. As Rocky begins his training of the coop to get them to fly, there is so much comedy to be had as they go from imitating martial arts moves to flying into fences and the ground with the help of a catapult. Screaming chickens aren't something you ever really think about being funny, but trust me, it does take a load off your mind. There is also a lot of wit and humorous dialogue that many small children will not pick up on, but that's okay, because it is more there to keep adults entertained for the movie as well. The remarks and comments are witty, intelligent, and make us laugh at just the sheer humor in the entire situation.
Claymation is all the rage in this film, and is some of the best work for animation of this sort that I've ever seen. Once you realize how much work actually goes into making a movie of this sort (each movement is shot frame-by-frame), you cna fully appreciate the work that goes into this movie. This technique of filmmaking sets it apart from regular animation and gives it a unique, 3D feel that makes it fresh and exciting.
""Chicken Run"" deserves more than just critical praise; it deserves a place in the movie hall of fame for being able to make us laugh like no other movie can. This movie breaks all the rules and proves to us that laughs don't come solely from gratuity and gross-outs. It proves that a children's movie can appeal just as much to an older audience, and it does so by combining sparkling animating techniques with sharp phrases and an easily appreciated story that is delightful and completely satisfying.",984614400,12,4449,4.521091811414392
1274401,5,B00003CXJ4,"The technical achievement of Chicken Run is amazing in and of itself; the scale of the story it tells with stop-motion animation is tremendous.  It really is a prisoner-of-war movie with chickens, as absurd as that sounds.  That sense of absurdity is one of the highlights of the movie -- but the other is the emotional core of the relationships between the chickens and their desire for freedom.  It's a very clever script, with lots of verbal humor and fine comic timing from the voice actors.

The British cast while unknown to the Americans, are superb, with Julia Sawalha playing the lead female role brilliantly. This is not just a British film. Mel Gibson, suspiciously included probably to appeal to a wider US audience (despite the fact he is Australian) does not ruin the film too much.

1274528,4,B00003CXJ4,"Being a huge fan of Wallace & Grommit, it pains me to only give CHICKEN RUN 4 stars instead of five.  However, after the endless praise it received, perhaps I was just expected more.
 First, the praise.  CHICKEN RUN is an excellent family film, and one that belongs in any parent's DVD library.  But being a simple retelling of THE GREAT ESCAPE (the first half hour alone has more Steve McQueen references than you can shake a stick at) with a poultry twist, the only thing that really elevates the story beyond the mundane are the chickens themselves.  As always, Aardman Animation's unique claymation talents (like Nick Park) bring a dimension of life to the characters, so much so that you can't help but get involved in the story.
 Maybe the big fault on my part is comparing the film to the previous Wallace & Grommit shorts, but I think the only thing that truly hurts this movie is the length.  As Disney's latest animated feature (THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE) proved this summer, family animated features don't need to be feature length to be feature films.  45 mintes to an hour would have been more than enough time to tell the tale with all enjoyable bits included, and that's the only reason it looses a star.",980035200,,1218,4.606481481481482

It was well paced and much shorter than those other would-be epics, even as it managed to provide a grander scope of the realm of humanity wrapped up in this story of chickens trying to escape doom at a farm.

Deliciously reminiscent of the 1981 classic BBC series ""Tenko"", (a tale of british female POWS in WWII), 'Chicken Run' cleverly envisions a British poultry farm as a barbed-wired camp in which a group of animated hens and one retired RAF rooster are trapped in a life of hopeless, egg-producing servitude. When the owners of the farm decide to up their profits by converting their operation to a chicken pie manufacturing plant, Ginger, the feisty, levelheaded hen who harbors visions of a glorious life beyond the confines of this hellish prison, decides it is time for the ladies to band together and find a way to escape once and for all.
Meanwhile, into their lives drops Rocky the Flying Rooster, a wisecracking American circus performer whose head is easily turned by the attention such a singular stud naturally receives from a coop full of love-starved females. Together, these unlikely heroes and heroines plan and scheme their big break, encountering various setbacks and thwarting multitudinous dangers along the way.
As a piece of animation, 'Chicken Run' is truly outstanding. Opting for traditional animated puppetry rather than drawn cel animation or even computer-generated graphics, the creators of 'Wallace and Gromit' (Peter Lord and Nick Park) do a remarkable job of creating an assortment of characters whose movements are fluid and whose appearance borders on the surrealistic. In short, these are not `realistic' looking chickens - all the better to enhance the otherworldly quality of the film's setting. The carefully crafted sets and backgrounds represent a similar triumph in the areas of attention to detail and establishment of mood.
The movie is, quite simply, a joy to look at from beginning to end, and it is gratifying to know that filmmakers can buck the recent trend towards full scale computer animation and still produce a film that looks this impressive.
Just as important, Karey Kirkpatrick has provided a script filled with clever one-liners, finding just the right balance of acerbic wit and heartwarming sentiment. In addition, every single voice, including [absolutely] fabulous Julia Sawalha as heorine Ginger, Miranda Richardson as cool, calculating Mrs. Tweedy, Jane Horrocks as lovely, featherhead Babs, ""Shakespeare in Love's"" Imelda Staunton as Bunty, the Stepford Hen and delicious Lynn Ferguson as Mac (you haven't lived if you haven't heard her speak, gorry!), sounds perfectly right in the context of the character assigned to it.
All in all, 'Chicken Run' certainly is one of the great works of animation done recently and it certainly will stand as one of the best such films of our times.",978307200,14,2861,5.317880794701987
1274666,5,B00003CXJ4,"This wonderful claymation story includes clever (and subtle) take-offs from various movies, some mentioned in other reviews. It has a brilliant script, with jokes aimed at every age range, although the subject material may not be suitable for the very young. The film has some US mainstream influence, but the overall feel (and humor) is approproately British, considering the location and time period (early 60s?). The chickens of Tweedy's farm are subject to World War II prisoner-of-war conditions. Mr. Tweedy has more than a suspicion that his chickens are ""organized"" in their escape attempts, led by the hen, Ginger. The motivation for escape is provided by the fate of those who don't lay eggs! However, Mrs. Tweedy has other plans for the hens, and the race to escape is on...

The script to me has all of the qualities and solid construction as a Neil Simon play. If you haven't seen or shared this movie, then I say, ""Run! and go get it""",978134400,2,372,4.109589041095891
1274668,4,B00003CXJ4,"When the owner of an egg farm grows impatient with the small profits her eggs are bringing, she and her husband decide to turn to the much more valuable chickens themselves, and begin converting their unassuming little farm into a much more lucrative chicken pie operation. The chickens, sensing that this can't possibly be good for their well being, heighten their attempts to escape.
One of the most eagerly anticipated films in the last few years, the debut feature from Nick Park (the creator of the beloved English claymation duo Wallace & Gromit) delivers on all counts. No, Wallace & Gromit themselves are not here, and this may be the film's only fault (along with a very slight feeling of claustrophobia), but there are plenty of new characters to meet and savor, mostly chickens (all good) and two humans (100% bad). From beginning to end, this little gem is filled with wisecracks, sight gags, and breathtaking action sequences including one nail-biting ride through the chicken pie machine very reminiscent of the final train chase of The Wrong Trousers.
Those familiar with Park's work know to expect an incredible attention to detail, which is astoundingly impressive since Park and crew still do it the old-fashioned way, 24 photographs per second, the same method Wladislaw Starewicz employed at the turn of the century. This results in an animation that isn't as smooth as, say, that found in Toy Story 2 (your eyes will notice the slight jerkiness right from the start), though in the end it's more rewarding, like the appreciation of the difference in quality between an Oriental rug made by a human as opposed to one made by a machine.",978048000,6,1655,4.914285714285715
1274669,5,B00003CXJ4,"If Speilberg or Lucas had tried their hands at stop-motion or clay-mation (or whatever) they'd be hard-pressed to match this opus by Park and Lord.  In ""Chicken Run"", the poor chickens who survive in the farm of the evil Ms. Tweedy dream of life over the hill where they can live as free-range chickens.  Until then, they must lay eggs.  Failure to make their quota guarantees a place on Ms. Tweedy's dinner table.  Persistent failed escapes continually land Ginger, the pluckiest of the coop, in the cooler.  After a particularly disasterous failure, all seems lost.  The unexpected arrival of an American Rooster, voiced by Mel Gibson, gives the unhappy hens a new idea for freedom and a new lease on life.
Yeah, ""Chicken Run"" sends up the ""Great Escape"" (which isn't likely to get new appreciation after this film, though it should) but keeps itself from becoming a parody.  Much of the ""Great Escape"" scenes are reserved for the credits, with the climax more of a nod to Attenborough's other masterpiece, ""Flight of the Phoenix"".  The meat of ""Chicken Run"" is its own story, in which the plight of the animated pullets' is in turns hysterically funny and yet touching as well.  There's even a great action sequence (a nod to ""Raiders"") set inside the guts of a chicken-pot-pie machine, one guaranteed to wind up as an attraction at Universal.
Park and Lord know how to keep the hearstrings from getting too abruptly yanked while the humans (who seem appropriately gigantic and move in the slow and ponderous manner needed to emphasize how immeasurably they tower over their chickens) convey just enough menace to flesh out the story without it becoming too scary for children.",977702400,3,1680,4.866666666666666

The chickens, led by the lead chicken Ginger, try many hilarious ways to escape from the chicken farm, but they all fail.

One of my favorite things about the film is to trying to figure out all the different parodies and allusions made to other films, televison, and pop culture. The basic plot line of the story is taken from THE GREAT ESCAPE. There are a couple of great scenes, and lines for that matter, stolen directly from STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Other films that are alluded to include STALAG 17, BRAVEHEART, SCHINDLER'S LIST, along with the television series STAR TREK.

Besides its endearing characters, cute, humorous and clever plotline, and exsquisite animation, Chicken Run has the first most lusciously evil female villain since....well, since a very long time! Mrs. Tweedy is of the mould which inspires idoltry - the sharp as nail eyes, the devious grin and disdainful sneer, the snap of her rubber gloves and the swish of her axe!
It's Mrs. Tweedy who makes the movie complete for me, but that doesn't mean it lacks in other aspects. Julia Swahla is delish as Ginger, the fearless hen leader determined to save herself and her feathered companions from ending up served in a pie, Mel Gibson is suitably cocky, and as we don't have to look at him,  rather cute, as Rocky the 'Flying' Rooster and Jane Horrocks as Babs, the daft and eternally sweet chicken, comes close to stealing the show from Miranda Richardson's Mrs. Tweedy.
Apart from that, the story is light-hearted and fun, with plenty of jokes directed to the adult audience, a few cheeky nods at old escape movies, and beautiful stop-animation from the award winners who brought us Wallace and Grommit.

I was originally hoping it to be polished and neatly produced (similar to the fantastic Toy Story movies) but you can only do so much when it comes to clay-mation.  Well with that said, 'Chicken Run' was truly a delight.  The jokes were on a childrens level--PART of the time...SOMETIMES the jokes were outright WAY over the heads of children--nothing dirty mind you, but the producers also realized what Disney figured out a few years back:  'Sure, it might be considered a kids film, but there are going to be a LOT of adults that see this, too--and you simply CANNOT ignore them anymore'.
TRYING to escape from a chicken's version of a concentration camp (the similarities are hilarious) and the motto of those running the camp: ""NOBODY escapes!""

1274916,3,B00003CXJ4,"I purchased this DVD because I liked a *lot* Nick Park's  W&G series. His humor is clever, yet innocent; I can't imagine anyone to be hurt by his humour and I say that's not very common. For me, humour is a very difficult art. Very often 'fun' things are not fun for me, but offensive and/or insult my intelligence. IMHO Nick Park has managed to do humor which is both very fun  and non-offensive or insulting. I admire his talent for this  achievement.
However, those who expect Chicken Run to create the same atmosphere as the W&G series will be surprised. Yes, I think CR is fun, but I'd say it is meant for a bit more mature audience than W&G series. First, the overall feeling in the movie is a bit dark. I guess the little children will find at least one character not fun at all, just evil and scary. For some reason, concentration camp was almost always in my mind when watching the movie, but I think it is good; there were certain wisdoms and  facts of life depicted quite cleverly in the movie. Where W&G series is a relaxing experience, I guess CR is a bit more inclined to make you wonder about sad facts of life, like tyranny, loss of freedom, violence, death and - yes, I'm serious here - treating of animals in the food industry.
However, and also because of these things, I think CR is a good movie and - I have to add - that british ol' rooster guy is an excellent and hilarious, say, character!
Oh yes, one more thing - for some reason, I don't think McDonalds will run ""Chicken Run"" campaign and serve special chicken burgers this time...

Other than that, there's really not much going on here. Mel Gibson does a ""so-so"" voice performance. I wouldn't be very proud of this if I were him. Julia Sawalha is very sweet, but her character is so flat that even her sweetness doesn't help it. Miranda Richardson is a flat, boring villainess of the worst kind. Other than that, there is a Scottish chicken who is supposed to be funny just for being Scottish, a hen who is supposedly very dumb, and so makes some very dumb jokes (""I don't want to be a pie! I don't like gravy."") and an old rooster who is supposed to be funny for being geriatric. The plot is unoriginal and filled with cliche's and the music is forgettable.
The animation is the only good point to this mediocre film; Stop-motion never looked better. But I'm afraid that makes this film an official waste of good talents.",976752000,7,1208,4.545871559633028

Claymation (the animation technique used) is done in nearby Portland, Oregon, and has been a favorite medium with our family since we first saw the Wallace and Gromit series. This movie is no exception. Everyone: adults and children, loved it.

In the story, the Tweedy chicken farm is portrayed as a World War Two prison camp patterned after those portrayed in Hogan's Heroes, Stalag 17 and The Great Escape with Steve McQueen, with the evil Mrs. Tweedy as the ""commandant,"" making those hens that aren't producing enough eggs into fried chicken.

Ginger (voice by Julia Sawalha), a hen bent on escape with a vision of a free life on real, green grass, is the heroine who inevitably ends up in the ""cooler,"" in the beginning of the film.  The hero, an American Rhode Island Red named Rocky (Mel Gibson's voice), is introduced early on as a rooster who can fly. The ""inmates"" are all persuaded that he will teach them to fly also, thereby enabling them to escape.

When Mrs. Tweedy decides that the real profit lies in chicken pot pie, rather than eggs, the plot thickens, and escape becomes a real necessity, since not only the occasional egg-laying malingerer is now threatened, but all of their lives. A veritable genocide awaits!

You will have to see it, to see how it all comes out.

It is very light-hearted, although the humor is not quite as sophisticated, perhaps, as in the Wallace and Gromit series. It is a delightful movie for children, and fun for adults as well. It is beautifully executed, and the voices fit the parts very well.

Forced to work relentlessly for a rapacious Mrs. Tweedy, Ginger tries desperately to inspire her fellow hens to dream of a better life.  Her plans for the future take a positive turn when Rocky, a circus run away, drops into farm and gets railroaded into teaching the chickens to fly.  The drama heightens when the greedy farmers decide to stop selling eggs and start selling chicken pies.
The film is filmed using stop motion claymation by the same team that made the popular Wallace & Gromit series.  Visually it is incredibly well done, with a plethora of unique and funny characters.  The movie does not rely on a bunch of flashy CGI special effects, rather it succeeds with originality and visual depth, making the film a work of art.
Obviously the cute characters and wholesome story line is designed to appeal to a younger audience, but unlike many films, it does so without insulting their intelligence with trite issues and silly behaviour.  Funny without being vulgar and action oriented without excessive violence makes it a safe bet for any age.
Adults may not find the film outright funny but it is definitely amusing.  Frequent references to other movies and a mature story line help the film reach adult audiences as well as children.
Overall, in sea of mediocre family programming, this film ranks as one of the better.",976060800,,1488,4.811764705882353
1275065,3,B00003CXJ4,"Thankyou Aardman for laying waste to one of popular theories of film making. My  previously unblemished idea that all animated pictures would be of a nothing less than superior  quality has been crushed.
What happened? It looked incredible - but I now  realise the trailers only showed the very best  bits from the film, which I felt was hurried along way to quickly, and very little character development actually occurred (particularly in the case of Rocky). There were a few amusing touches, such as the constant references to other films (indy jones, star wars, star trek etc - see if you can spot them). In some peolpe's eyes I can see how this film is considered as excellent - all the ingredients are there - but for me it just didn't work.
The story follows the plans of Ginger, a determined chicken, who is desperate to escape from a battery farm, but is visited by a certain Rocky the Rooster, who poses as a flight expert in order to gain various things. All the while the farm owners have other plans, involving a chicken pie machine.
See it by all means, and draw your own conclusions, but there is better material out there (namely the CGI stuf by Pixar - Toy Story et al).",975801600,2,1187,4.5327102803738315

The characters are cute and are more developed than most non-animated (or Claymation) actors.  Kids will like the physical humor and appreciate their ""friends"" the two mice.  The animation or claymation(whatever) is spectacular and the story is never boring.  The DVD has a lot of good extra's like directors commentary and a documentary on the making of Chicken Run.  I'd recommend this film for anyone....very well done.",975715200,6,579,4.917525773195877
1275067,4,B00003CXJ4,"Let me start off by saying that I have a great deal of faith in Mel Gibson.  Anything O.K. by that guy is O.K. by me.  So when I found out he was one of the voices in ""Chicken Run"", I decided to buy the DVD sight unseen.  This is a leap of faith for me, because I'm chintzy and hate paying the extra for DVD unless the movie has great special effects, which I was pretty sure this one didn't.
Mel didn't let me down.  This is a solidly entertaining movie, made for the whole family.  Kids will love the surface story, which is pretty basic and uplifting, with plenty of pratfalls; adults will  appreciate the many nods to famous movies, such as ""Stalag 17"", ""The Great Escape"" and even ""The Blues Brothers"", to name a few of the obvious ones.  And the rooster is so Mel; I loved it.  The other characters are engaging and three-dimensional (in more ways than one);  I feel I should apologize to the cast of voices for not mentioning their names because they were all so good!
Anyone who enjoyed ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" should really appreciate this movie, as should anyone who liked ""Babe"" and ""Babe: Pig In The City"".  In fact, fans of Disney animateds will probably like ""Chicken Run"" as well, because it embodies the same  moral aspects of those movies--the good guys are so appealing, and the bad guys so reprehensible.  I feel the movie edged into four stars; I found ""Toy Story"" better than ""Toy Story 2"" although both rated a four for me; I would rate ""Chicken Run"" on a par with ""Toy Story 2"".",975369600,4,1507,4.3428571428571425

I haven't yet gotten a chance to hear the commentary, but I will comment on the other parts of the dvd. the production notes are useful, they give alot of intricate info on how the movie was made. the trailers are good too! i like the one with the mi2 parody!
the making of and hatching of chicken run features are good too, some repeated clips but overall, very informative on how the claymation process of the movie was filmed, how the characters were played by the actors, everything you wanted to know.

 In this film, chickens at a farm in England just learned that they are going to be used for new chicken pies that their farmer decides to produce due to lack of chicken eggs. The chickens must not die and save one another.
 Then one day a rooster named Rocky comes flying into the farm. Ginger, a chicken, asks if he will help them escape and he does it but only if he gets something he wants. But Rocky is no ordinary Rooster, he can fly. He decides to try to teach them to fly and the outcome shows minimal success.
 One day while searching through the stable he found photos of British airforce planes and then this bright idea hits him... he'll build a plane!
 And that he does with the help from the roosters. i won't give away anymore except you must see this movie and see what all the buzz is about. You can't go wrong with this great film. Buy and have fun.

CHICKEN RUN is a worthy extension of the WALLACE AND GROMIT series q.v. which demonstrates that you don't have to digitize animation to be entertaining.  This is originality at its best.  Mel Gibson is good, but Miranda Richardson (of BLACKADDER fame) is better. This is one you'll want to own, to watch over and over.  Pity the DVD has no Spanish track or subs (unlike W&G), since my niece in Ecuador would just flip over it.",974937600,,523,4.580645161290323

Along with that the story is really funny, and the characters are delightful. Each chicken has their own personality, which I find incredible that it was pulled off. As for the DVD itself I was a little disappointed with the addons. There are two 'making of' featurettes which unfortunatly have almost identical content and footage. It was nice to see those movie trailer spoofs if MI:2 and Gladiator, but there were numerous other ones that they didn't include. The DVD-Rom features are neat, but I've seen better on other discs.

1275215,5,B00003CXJ4,"This movie rocks. It is not only entertaining, but contains a very important message: meat is murder. While many people might watch this movie and just think it is making fun of the plight of chickens, it is really saying much more than that. When I saw this movie in theatre (4 times!!!), kids all around me were really upset with the be-heading scene. They would turn to their parents and say ""She's not dead, is she?"" or ""They're not really going to kill her, are they?"", while the parents sort of shifted uncomfortably in their seats.  The reality is that they do kill the chickens. Spending all of their miserable existance in factory farms (much worse than the conditions shown in the Tweedy's farm), they are one of the unluckiest of all of the animals on this planet. It shouldn't be this way.

1275216,5,B00003CXJ4,"Well, what an absolute joy and surprise this movie turned out to be. I was dumb-founded from start to finish as to how the animators actually created this magical stop-motion picture. In the past three days I have watched this disc over and over again, not tiring of it at all. The story (ala ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"") is simple yet effective. A group of English hens constantly plot and scheme to escape from their chicken farm, run by the tyrannical Mrs Tweedy (the voice of Miranda Richardson), before they are turned into chicken pies. Their only hope comes in the shape of a cocky, plucky American rooster named Rocky Roads (Mel Gibson in his best performance to date). ""Chicken Run"" is filled with great adult one-liners and jokes and is packed with every war/escape movie cliche know to this genre. It will also appeal to the little ones. The disc is great value. The DTS soundtrack is pretty awesome and really kicks into power when the chicken pie oven blasts into action....WOW! The video transfer is crystal clear, which adds an extra dimension to the clay models. The extras are fun also. The ""Chicken Panic"" button is very cute, ""The Making Of"" docos (there are two) are VERY interesting and informative, and there is great information about the movie hidden throughout the menus....you have to find them! The highlight of the disc is the voice of Jane Horrocks (""Little Voice"" and Bubble from ""Ab Fab"") who steals the show as Babs the dumb hen! She's hysterical. Make sure you buy this disc for your DVD library. You won't be disappointed!

Julia Sawalha's voice captured Ginger's personality, warmth, intelligence and ""humanity"" perfectly.  Her initial escape attempts are perfect satirizations of ""The Great Escape"", right down to throwing the baseball against the wall while in the ""cooler"".  I also appreciated the serious undertone of death that hung over the movie.  We saw that the threat is real and that added to the urgency.  I also loved the big dance number, the fact that the other chickens had distinct personalities, and that the Tweety's were terrific villians.  This movie also proved that chickens do indeed have lips... and teeth!  And how expressive those teeth are.  And listen closely at the end to rats' variation on what came first: the chicken or the egg.  VERY funny.  I want to see another movie with these characters.

I think I was expecting something brainless yet less offensive than the other fare when I chose this movie, but I'm glad I did.  It's only fair that I say one of the major appeals of this movie was it's spoofing of ""The Great Escape,"" one of my favorite WWII movies.  However, even if I had never seen that classic, ""Chicken Run"" would have been highly appealing.  Clay animation, quality clay animation is under-represented.  Visually, this movie was astounding.  The humor was appropriate for all levels of comprehension, without boring an adult audience.  In fact, an adult might find this movie far more amusing than a child, but let's not deprive anyone of the priveldge of seeing this film.  The voices were very well chosen (I love the accents), including a surprising Mel Gibson.  One reason I enjoyed this movie was because I did not immediately recognize a voice and associate it with the person, as happens when celebrities provide the voices for other animated films.  In this, the voice was that of the character, which kept my distractions down.  The plot was really very original, despite the spoof quality.

Now here's a little parental secret exclusive to amazon.com participants: This film contains subtle lessons in morality, and a subliminal message that both adults and children will absorb . . .

A great Oscar-winning clay animator  of the very whimsical Wallace and Gromit, Nick Park goes on with a great  feature-length project involving all the unhappy chickens who are kept like  P.O.W.s on a heavily guarded poultry farm owned by the witch-like Mrs.  Tweedy and her baboon-minded husband. Of all those timid fussbudgets, one  young hen named Ginger is quite plucky enough (no pun intended) to make  countless daring attempts to escape her hopeless fate as a producer of eggs  and eventually a main dish for the cruel Tweedy family's supper. However,  the future does look very bleak when one of the hapless chickens finally  meets her end under Mrs. Tweedy's axe. Until ... a swaggering American  rooster called Rocky suddenly appears to bring a very sparkly shard of hope  to Ginger and all her cellmates. Unfortunately, Rocky is quite daunted by  such a huge role so unexpectedly forced onto him that he really scurries to  buy some more time for himself as more and more of the prisoners all gather  to look upon him as a real hero. Meanwhile, the greedy old Mrs. Tweedy,  quite frustrated with the rate of egg production, decides to purchase a  monstrous chicken potpie-making machine that will wrap up all the fates of  her poor chickens in one deadly stroke. Not to mention the very fact old  Rocky turns out to be a FAKE, so Ginger simply must hurry and think of  something else FAST...
A very wonderful example of anthropomorphism so  cleverly displayed through shrewd manipulation of lifeless clay as well as  a very generous peppering of movie references, visual gags, and plenty of  giggle-inducing slapstick. Also thrown in is the very spine-tingling ride  through the potpie machine's great pitfalls as well as a great Bug's  Life-like climax that will surely send you to the very edge of your seat!  Neverthless, we all still enjoy dining on chicken, however.",967939200,6,2068,4.938953488372093
1275336,5,B00003CXJ4,"An absolutely wonderful film that operates on many levels.  As a kids' story, it's about a bunch of adorable claymation chickens escaping from a  prison-like farm to freedom.  For adults, it has plenty of in-jokes that  WWII buffs will pick up on, including a a few barbs aimed at those  ""Yanks"" who ""show up late for every war.""  Animation  fans will love the stop-action effects, which are a blend of stark realism  in the farmyard fences and buildings, with fantastic whimsy in the  Automatic Pie Machine and the ""Old Crate"" that the chickens build  to make their escape.  And be sure to sit through the credits at least  once, because the ""chicken and egg"" debate between the two rats  picks up again at the end.
 To the Jewish readers of my reviews  here, let me add that this film can be a very good help in discussiing the  Holocaust with your children in a non-threatening way.  It's hard to miss  the parallels between the ""selections"" in the Nazi camps and the  black-booted farmer's wife deciding who gets the chop today for not laying  enough eggs, for example.  The issue of resistance is dealt with very well,  too. I wouldn't be surprised if references to this movie start showing up  in Jewish classrooms this fall.",967075200,8,1231,4.649532710280374
1275337,5,B00003CXJ4,"""Chicken Run"" is one of those rare movies that definitely appeal to both a younger and a more mature audience. Both children and adults will  be mesmerized by the uncannily well modelled plasticine hens and by the  hurly-burly action that unfolds in the course of the story, but the  grown-ups among us will enjoy other things, too.
First, there are the  countless allusions to classic movies, from the gloomy prison camp  atmosphere reminiscent of ""Stalag 17"" to Ginger's rhythmic  smashing of a baseball against the wall during solitary confinement - taken  from Steve McQueen's character in ""The Great Escape"" - and to her  saving her bonnet in true Indiana Jones style from behind the closing oven  door (echoing ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""). Indeed,  there probably were so many other allusions I did not spot that I am  thinking about going to watch the movie one more time. And then, secondly,  there is also the astonishing variety of English accents displayed. Since  the movie is set somewhere in the Yorkshire dales, we get introduced to  farmer Tweedy's Yorkshire dialect but also to Rocky's John Waynish babbling  and to Mac's Scottish staccato that Rocky is not able to understand. Oh, we  were just roaring with laughter!

1275338,5,B00003CXJ4,"""Chicken Run"" (the latest from Aardman Studios, the makers of the  'Wallace and Gromit' films) is simply the most delightful, visually  amazing, and FUN animated movie since Disney's ""The Lion King.""  Other studios (notably Warner Brothers) have tried to take a bite out of  Disney's pie-share of the kid-movie market, but Aardman and Dreamworks have  done it best in this charming, hilarious, and edge-of-your-seat thrilling  animated fantasy about a group of hens trying to break out of a chicken  farm. Running the farm with an evil eye and an iron ax are the villainous  Mrs. Tweedie and her henpecked (literally) husband, who's sure those  chickens are plotting escape. The voices are perfect, from Julia Sawalha  and Joan Horrocks from ""Absolutely Fabulous"" as chickens to Mel  Gibson as the ""flying"" rooster Rocky. I want to recommend that  every parent take their kids to see this one: unlike many other recent  cartoons, this one is completely suitable for all but the very youngest  children (there's some tense moments in a chase at the end, and a little  threatening to the chickens with an ax), but even better, this will delight  and amuse the adults with its clever animation, perfect voice-casting,  witty visual allusions to famous movies like ""The Great Escape,""  ""The Bridge over the River Kwai,"" and ""Raiders of the Lost  Ark,"" and Indiana Jones-type thrills that range from a chase inside an  automatic chicken pie-making machine to a dramatic and climatic escape that  is reminiscent of, but even improves on, the high-energy chase sequences of  Aardman's ""Wallace and Gromit"" films. The moral lessons (you can  succeed better with teamwork; stand by your friends) are pointed but  gentle, without hitting kids over the head. I can't recommend this one  highly enough, folks, whatever age you are.

The  clay animation ('claymation') is really impressive and the film itself is a  perfect family treat that surprisingly works just as well with adults as it  does with kids. The movie is basically a 'claymation' spin-off on that  great action movie starring Steve McQueen; 'The Great Escape'. Some of the  scenes are even identical; for example the whole beginning credits when  Ginger keeps getting 'solitary' and near the end she takes out a ball and  starts to bounce it on the wall, this is a very famous scene with Steve  McQueen doing that in 'The Great Escape'. The chickens themselves are  detailed and richly textured characters. Right from the beginning you are  under the spell of this enchanting film, you really want these chickens to  escape. And when they do it turns out to be a very rewarding experience.  There is also an exciting and very amusing action sequence inside the pie  machine with Rocky trying to save Ginger that owes a lot to the 'Indiana  Jones' movies. The chickens are brought to life by the voices of several  actresses, Julia Sawalha is the voice of Ginger the 'escape-paranoid'  chicken who is the leader of the female chickens. Mel Gibson is perfect as  'Rocky the Flying Rooster', he's the only 'American' voice in the cast and  manages to get a lot of laughs. Miranda Richardson is also memorably wicked  as Mrs. Tweedy who wants to get rich by making 'chicken pies'. A very  funny, surprisingly intelligent and enchanting family film.

This is a funny, witty, off-the-wall escape movie starring a roost of chickens belonging to the  malevolent Mrs. Tweedy, who kills any chicken who doesn't lay enough eggs.  Ginger, a fiery hen with dreams of a future in the wide open spaces, tries  to escape every night, and gets caught every night by obsessive Mr. Tweedy,  who believes the chickens are plotting.
But soon a rooster who can FLY  shows up, and promises to help the hens learn how to escape. But as they  discover, Mrs. Tweedy has made a terrifying decision...
Don't be  surprised if any kiddies you see this with refuse their Chicken McNuggets  for weeks. Ginger and the other chickens are animated by the wonderful  ""Gromit"" animators. Since this takes place in England, most of  the cast is British, not including Mel Gibson as Rocky the Flying...  Rooster. (Not Squirrel. Rooster)
Rocky and Ginger are wonderful  opposites, the dead-serious escaper and the cocky, insecure loner. Also  shining are the heavy, cynical Bunty; idiotic, perpetually-knitting Babs,  who asks if a beheaded chicken is ""on holiday"", but who steals  one of the best lines in the entire movie (""Ooh... me whole life  flashed before my eyes. It was rather boring"") Rooster Fowler is the  kind of crusty jerk you love, even if he is more than a bit prejudiced  against ""Yanks.""
And, possibly my favorite character is Mac,  the glasses-wearing, brainy hen who is Ginger's sidekick in the escape  attempts. Watch for her Montgomery Scott ""Star Trek""  moment!
This is a funny, heavily-nuanced movie, but you don't need to  have seen ""escape"" movies to appreciate the wonderful writing,  jokes, and ""human"" characters! ""Chicken-hearted"", me  foot!",964656000,2,1730,4.989473684210527

7917501,1,B00003CXJ4,"I could not stomach watching this movie.  It was touted to be fun and entertaining family fare and it was anything but.  It is evident immediately that it represents the story of concentration camps, and a fairly graphic silhouetted beheading of one of the characters takes place in the first few minutes.  Perhaps it's just me, but seeing the bad guys ""get theirs"" in the end does not justify experiencing the ""bad things that happen to good people""  This is certainly not cute, funny family entertainment and since it is not possible to ""unsee"" anything, I regret having watched it",1525219200,,583,4.8
