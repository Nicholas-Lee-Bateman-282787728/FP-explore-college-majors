3875675,5,B00290X6OG,"This video brought back many memories. My husband (deceased now) was an engineer on the Apollo program until we put the man on the moon.  I, too, worked the program - and it was the most wonderful experience in both of our lives.  To think they did it with analog computers!  I wish America had this spirit now - so many people working for the same goal !  So many people so proud to be Americans !",1354924800,,398,4.12987012987013
3875676,4,B00290X6OG,"This is a good DVD. Some of the footage a little haphazard patched together. It could of meshed better. Apollo 11,12, 13 and 17 were good parts. I really missed them not showing Apollo 14,15 and 16. Fly me to the moon and back was OK describing the actual trajectories needed and how to get to the moon and back. Behind the scenes of people that helped in the Apollo program you probably never heard of. Good history seeing and hearing President Kennedy's speech at Rice university. Interesting sideshow of Apollo 11 and the Universe.

Ive read almost all the astronaut books. Its nice to see some footage of the actual missions. Glad to have this DVD to show my kids and eventually their kids the past glories of Apollo manned space exploration. Sadly this is not taught in school. Its important history. Have a family night and show this DVD to your kids. Its nice now and then seeing something educational rather than some of the mindless crap movies that are put out today. They maybe have no interest at first but explain to them so much of the technology they use today came from the space program. Tell them maybe someone they grow up with may someday go to the Moon or Mars.",1276214400,,1182,4.497674418604651
3875677,1,B00290X6OG,"Words cannot convey my disappointment with this DVD, which touts itself as a commemorative documentary about one of mankind's greatest achievements, yet is full of errors and omissions.  It was slapped together from stock footage and canned interviews from other sources.  It purports to give a history of the steps to the moon, yet ignores Project Gemini, which proved the feasibility of working in space with the first American space walk and the rendezvous & docking maneuvers which made the Apollo moon missions possible.  There is no excuse for the voice-over announcer to refer to the mighty Apollo booster as the Saturn Vee! It is hard to believe that any adult in the year MMIX couldn't recognize a Roman numeral. I expected to relive a cherished memory of my childhood, but instead worried about how little research and effort was put into a chronicling such a momentous event.  Some better choices would be the excellent TBS documentary ""MOONSHOT"", ""Walter Cronkite Remembers""(CBS), or HBO's ""From the Earth to the Moon"".",1270857600,10,1031,5.0828402366863905
3875678,2,B00290X6OG,"I agree completely with Mr. Dacey's description of this video as being done on the cheap from stock NASA footage.  In fact, it wouldn't even play on one of my DVD players, and the other had a little trouble reading it.  The soundtrack was disappointing, and there were several minor factual errors in the narration.  So although I agree with his description, I feel compelled to give it a lower rating.

But I have to admit that I had not seen some of the launch footage, so it was worth something.  I much prefer David Sington's ""In the Shadow of the Moon.""",1264809600,4,558,4.431372549019608
3875679,4,B00290X6OG,"My first thought on initial viewing was:""What a rip-off, I've been mislead and want my money back!"" I decided to cool down and just watch the entire thing and THEN decide. Firstly, the whole thing is done on the cheap, so no new interviews and recently stated proclamations by Armstrong, Collins or Aldrin, which was really what I came for. I can live with that,though. The voice-over is colorless and uninspired, it sounds like something on a one-reeler the A/V boys wheeled into science class a minute ago and the narrator even calls it a ""Saturn Vee"", not once but TWICE! The soundtrack was a solo acoustic guitar strumming melodiously but really, what more do you need? They were capable and it was pleasant to listen to. The ""extras"" were old NASA public relations films concerning Apollo 11 (in a general sense) which was narrated by Burgess Meredith, Apollo 12 & 13 (as post-mission reports) Apollo 17 ( no matter how they tried to 'spin' it, I'm STILL mad congress cut NASA's funding for more moonshots!), a pretty dull film on the slide-rule jockeys that actually got 'us' to the moon and JFK's Rice University speech (""We choose to go to the moon...""). Additionally,  there is an Apollo 11 'slide show' and the visual gem of the whole disc, a 'slide show' of images of the universe courtesy of the Hubble telescope which is truly WONDERFUL! This is not to say the vintage Apollo shorts are not. They are. I know for sure I saw some of these in the day at IPMS meetings, there was always a member who worked for North American Rockwell or TRW that had access to these films and brought them to meetings, I would've watched until the last dog was hung! For me, the best part is on Apollo 12 when Alan Bean is feeding numbers to Pete Conrad during the latter's 'pinpoint' landing at ""Snowman"" crater. Bean-o is so cool and reassuring and even enthusiastic as Pete is getting it done, about 180 degrees opposite that of the same procedure on Apollo 11 (Mike Collins referred to the trio as 'amiable strangers') Conrad, Bean and Gordon made their encore mission seem like three frat rats on a road trip by comparison. So, yeah, I ended up being pleasantly surprised and a satisfied customer over/after all. It's not as well produced as ""In The Shadow of the Moon"" or ""For All Mankind"" but those two films had a one day lunch budget that far exceeded what ""Mill Creek Entertainment"" probably has for their yearly operations! Thanks Amazon, keep the suggestions coming!",1248652800,20,2472,4.65675057208238
3875680,4,B00290X6OG,"A good companion to ""In the Shadow of the Moon"".
I would buy both.  This DVD reminds me of ""For All Mankind"" because it is made from the classic 16mm film footage.  The soundtrack is also very nice.",1247875200,7,198,4.184210526315789

3875682,5,B00290X6OG,"This documentary is made from rare NASA film footage and radio transmissions.
It tells the story from launch to landing and includes over 3 hours of additional footage from the NASA archives.  My favorite bit is when Buzz says (while climbing out of the capsule for the first time) ""I'll be sure not to lock the door behind me.""  priceless!",1247788800,6,340,4.65
