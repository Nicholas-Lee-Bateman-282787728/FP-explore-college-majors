8386330,4,B0030ZH7NU,"At first, I it seemed this was not my style, then The Speers Family sang Blessed Assurance, and I dedicded that song made this worth the price. They saved the best for last. After the first 2 songs I enjoyed it very much. The first 2 songs are contemporary. The rest are Southern Gospel. Here is a list of songs:
There's Peace in Knowing - - I've got to Praise Him - - Close to the Well - -  Blessed Assurance - -  Granddaddy Finely by Walt Mills - - Let's Celebrate Jesus - - When I Go Sailing - - Get Away Jordan by the Dove Brothers Quartet (Very wonderful performance!) - - I'm Forgiven - - -  Sheltered in the Arms of God by the Homeland Quartet.
  If you love old time Gospel singing, you will like this.",1362873600,,710,4.042857142857143
