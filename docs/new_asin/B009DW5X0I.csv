Along with all the tshirts, figurines, key chains, books, cups... name it and we get it :) The show will always have true fans... Keep 'em coming!!",1354492800,6,324,4.327868852459017
5322098,4,B009DW5X0I,"After 15 Seasons, most of us fans have been getting worn down.  Have you ever stopped to consider what issues the Simpsons Have Not hit yet?  It's a small list.  So Season 15 is not a grand gem, but you will enjoy many of these episodes.
""Treehouse of Horror XIV""- Reaper Madness - Homer becomes Death, Frinkenstein - Prof. Frink creates a Frankenstein monster out of his deceased dad, Stop the World, I Want to Goof Off- Bart and Milhouse get a watch that can stop time.  These are some funny episodes, and have some great laughs.

""My Mother the Carjacker""- Glenn Close returns as Mona Simpson.  It's not a tearjerker like the earlier Homer's Mom episode, but there are moments.

""The President Wore Pearls""- Lisa becomes student president in a musical episode.  Personally, I am not a huge musical episode fan.

""The Regina Monologues""- The Simpsons go to London.  A goofy episode, but some very funny cameos by Tony Blair and J K Rowling.

""The Fat and the Furriest""- Homer takes on the bears.  Homer 1- Bears 20

""Today, I am a Clown""- Jackie Mason returns as Rabbi Krustofski when Krusty learns he was never given a bar mitzvah.

""'Tis the Fifteenth Season""- Homer is the most selfish man in Springfield during Christmas, and once he tries to redeem himself, he makes Flanders jealous.  I have a soft spot for the Christmas episodes.

""Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays""- Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples And Teens And Gays Against Parasitic Parents protest having to pay for families after babies riot a cancelled concert.

""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot""- Homer dresses as a battle bot to win a tournament and Bart's admiration. This has some great slapstick, but the B-plot where Snowball II dies and Lisa goes through new cats is funny on a terrible level.

""Diatribe of a Mad Housewife""- Marge writes a romance novel and Homer becomes an ambulance driver, adding to the 100+ jobs Homer has on his 20-page resume.

""Margical History Tour""- Simpsons Story Time: History Edition!: Henry VIII's wants a son, Lewis and Clark explore North America with Sacagawea, and Salieri tries to destroy Mozart. As a history fan, the combination of history jokes and historical inaccuracy gave me an embolism.

""Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore""- Milhouse moves to Capitol City and Homer finds lucrative work in being a bum.

""Smart and Smarter""- Maggie takes an IQ test, and she is smarter than Lisa.  Lisa handles this with the grace we have always come to expect from the Simpson family.  The thing I really don't like is the Simon Cowell cameo.

""The Ziff Who Came to Dinner""- Artie Ziff crashes with the Simpsons after cheating his stockholders.  This episode also includes the world's most bowel-wrenching ""coupling"" when Artie and Selma get it on... that sentence hurt to type.

""Co-Dependent's Day""- Homer and Marge become drinking buddies and it goes great until Homer blames Marge for his DUI.

""The Wandering Juvie""- Bart gets sent to juvie after creating a fake wedding registry.

""My Big Fat Geek Wedding""- Edna and Skinner are getting married! OK, so Skinner has some reservations.  When Edna storms out, she hooks up with Comic Book Guy.  Skinner tries to win her back at Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con.  My favorite scene is the cameo by Matt Groening.

""Catch 'Em If You Can""- Homer and Marge try to take a break from the kids, and Bart and Lisa go after them.

""Simple Simpson""- Homer becomes ""Pie Man"".  This is a really fun episode and worth some of the other... less than stellar episodes.

""The Way We Weren't""- a flash back episode about Homer and Marge's encounter at camp.

""Bart-Mangled Banner""- Bart becomes deaf due to a vaccine shot, and he accidentally moons the flag during a donkey basketball game.  This causes Springfield's patriotism to be questioned.  This is a great ""poke the bear"" type episode.

""Fraudcast News""- Mr. Burns buys all of Springfield's media outlets after finding out everyone wants him dead, and the only non-burns media left is Lisa's Red Dress Press.",1354233600,48,4017,4.8774002954209745

5322174,5,B009DW5X0I,I'm waiting to buy each year after it comes out to get them cheaper...so far my plan is working. When I retire I'm going to watch them all.,1387584000,,139,4.0
5322175,5,B009DW5X0I,"I was hesitant to order season 15- not having previously seen any of these episodes, and in light of how bad the last few seasons had been- but desperate for a Simpsons fix, I gave it a shot. You can imagine my surprise, when I popped in the first DVD, and started watching the first ep- a Treehouse Of Horror ep, which are never among my favorites- and lo and behold it was a gem!
Ditto for many more episodes.

Watching the first half of this season, I saw that the crew at The Simpson's seems to have pulled themselves out of the years-long slump that they were in. Most of the magic of the early seasons is back! (The humor; the use of many favorite secondary characters, etc.)

O-K, still, a lot of the intelligent wit is still missing....but hey, at least the show is vastly improved from recent years- well...at least that is true for the first half of this season. The second half of this season is where it appears that the crew started running out of steam again. Once again, they start to revert back to plot-centric episodes, where it appears that they put all their effort into the story line, and neglect the humor and the little touches that often make the show so great. (Not that I can blame them- seeing as it so much work to make these shows, and that many of them have been working on this show for so many years...I mean, they're only human.)

But all in all, in my book, half of a good season is better than an entire bad season, so I can't complain (Though I might have, had I paid full price for this season! For half-price- which is what I paid- half a season of good eps seems about right:D)

My biggest complaint about this season: TOO MANY MUSICAL numbers. And I'm not just talking about the one musical episode (Why-oh-why do they torture us by making Yeardley Smith sing??!! Please...PLEASE stop!). The use of popular-music cues over montages is done in just about every episode- to the point of being clich. I mean, such can be effective when done when appropriate, to good effect, and with restraint- but it seems as though the Simpson's crew has started using such as a crutch to merely fill space. (It's showing, guys!)

The BEST thing about this season, is [drum roll].....the COMMENTARIES! Yes! In past seasons, it had seemed like those doing the commentaries had lost interest- but this season, they back to their former glory. I normally enjoy listening to the commentaries as much as/or even more than watching the actual show- and this seasons commentaries were no disappointment. I was in my glory listening to the commentary on every episode. I think writer Tom Gammill was on just about every one...and he is one of my all-time favorites, so that also helped!

Again, like earlier seasons, the commentaries were once again very enjoyable; informative and funny. Kudos to all those who participates, for taking the time to do these commentaries. Some of REALLY enjoy them! (I take back what I said earlier. The price of this season would be justified just for the commentaries, alone!).

All-in-all...at least 10 very good episodes; and all good commentaries- makes this season add up to 75% good content. But I'm giving it 5 stars for the great commentaries! (I should deduct 4 stars for the continuation of the LOUSY packaging!).

If you're a fan of the earlier Simpson's...this season is for you!",1386633600,2,3341,4.6127946127946124

5322177,5,B009DW5X0I,"Our motivation to buy this season was the 'The Fat and the Furriest' episode, which, to us, has the hallmarks of a quintessential Simpsons show. Although it's in Blu-ray, its picture quality can't be savored as this season was sketched a few years before they started HD production. Nonetheless, material always outshines polish. (And the Blu-ray version was the same price as the DVD version.)",1384646400,,394,5.076923076923077

5322180,5,B009DW5X0I,"I just love these Simpsons DVD/Blu-Ray releases. They're always jam packed with extra content, such as commentary on every episode (and not just commentary mini's like on South Park box sets). There's always a bunch of deleted scenes, tv promos/adverts, and animation showcases, where you can look at a lot of Simpsons artwork. Both before AND after the color is added. Pretty interesting.

Seasons Fourteen and Fifteen are the first two I ever bought on Blu-Ray. I used to buy the DVD's, but I stopped buying those because I DESPISE that accordion-like packaging that they started doing with those. It causes the discs to get scratched, and I think it's SO stupid. I can't believe they haven't learned their lesson by now. I actually prefer the DVD's over the Blu-Rays. They also have a lot more artwork inside. But the accordion packaging ruins everything. That's why I started buying the Blu-Ray versions.

The thing I DON'T like might not be caused from this Blu-Ray set itself. It might be my Blu-Ray player. But every time I buy one of these Simpsons Blu-Ray sets, it takes forever to load. And if I accidentally press stop, big mistake. I have to wait for it to load again. This doesn't happen with any other Blu-Ray discs I own. Only with these Simpsons seasons.

I also had trouble getting the deleted scenes to play on this season set for some reason. If I chose to play the episode with deleted scenes turned on, and then stopped it. It would never play the deleted scenes once I restarted the episode. I would have to go back to the episode selection menu and re-select the ""PLAY WITH DELETED SCENES"" option again before it would register that I selected it.",1376611200,,1670,4.69283276450512
5322181,5,B009DW5X0I,I liked this one more than season 14 and was glad I purchased it. I recommend this to Simpsons fans for sure!,1376265600,,109,4.0

The worst I can say about this season is that you'll not pay full attention to some of the 22 episodes. I was often typing on my laptop, but I could still hear it and I laughed many times throughout. The best of them are still very well-written though the overall quality is still above average. There are no classic episodes in this season, but it does introduce us to Homer's superhero alter ego Pieman, as well as Marge's Mills and Boon version of Homer, and the return of Homer's fugitive mom. All of this is undone by a certain war criminal (to whom Homer refers as Mr. Bean) cameo-ing as himself. As well as plenty of laughs there is some caustic satire, but its not really subtle.

The show once again looks great on Blu-ray in 1.33:1 1080p with lively DTS HD-MA sound. There are a decent amount of extras, including 3 Otto-based episodes from older seasons, which also look great and a noticeable upgrade from the DVD counterparts. It proves, again, that the older seasons would benefit from a Blu-ray upgrade, but since Fox release these seasons approximately once every 40 years I doubt it will happen. Another nice feature of this Blu-ray is the ability to integrate the deleted scenes back into the show. I wish the others had this innovation. Definitely worth buying, despite the rut.

5322187,3,B009DW5X0I,"Season 15 is probably one of the worst Simpsons seasons, but still has many funny episodes. For long-time Simpsons fans, the great storylines and hilarious scenarios are replaced by cheap laughs from a random bit of Homer acting feminine or an out-of-character one liner from Bart stating a wryly insightful contradiction of modern society. The episodes are sometimes faster paced than previous seasons, but something is lost.

People believe Family Guy copied this show. That's looking at it too superficially. They are satirizing the Simpsons. They are lampooning how formulaic it has become. For example: Why do you think Meg receives so much criticism and flack? It's likely because the creators of the show loathe the Lisa character.

The England episode was funnier than I remembered; in particular, Homer sightseeing from a ferris wheel spotting among other sights, Jimmy Page (I'm quoting here) greatest thief of black music in the world.

5322208,5,B009DW5X0I,"I can't say that Season 15 is the among the strongest of Simpsons seasons, but it has some very enjoyable and memorable episodes.

Some of my favorites:
Episode 5: ""The Fat and the Furriest"" - Homer is attacked by a bear and builds an anti-bear suit to protect himself so he can get revenge.

Episode 9:  ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot""  - Homer is determined to prove to Bart that he can really accomplish something.  He builds a battle robot which Bart uses to fight other robots.  This episode also has a very funny (and a bit sad) side story where the family's cat Snowball II dies and Lisa tries desperately to find a replacement cat.

Episode 19: ""Simple Simpson"" - Homer becomes a vigilante in the form of ""Pie Man"".  He throws pies into the face of evil doers, but winds up in a tough spot.

I enjoy season 15, and one of my favorite episodes is the Battlebots spoof, ""I (annoyed grunt) Bot,"" also known as ""I D'oh Bot."" There is a great joke about the name of their fictitious show, ""Robot Rumble,"" wherein the show's announcer says, ""And now back to Robo Trumble.... I'm sorry, that's Robot Rumble."" I remember it very clearly from the original broadcast, and after some research online, I've found that a lot of other fans remember it fondly as well. Unfortunately this great one-liner is missing from the dvd set! I watched the episode several times just to see if I missed it (and all the deleted scenes as well), and it is nowhere to be found.

While there aren't hits-after-hits in season 15, there is a good chunk of funny stuff here.  Particularly: ""The President Wore Pearls,"" ""Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays,"" ""Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" ""Co-Dependent's Day,"" ""My Big Fat Geek Wedding,"" ""Catch 'Em If You Can,"" and ""The Way We Weren't.""  I think it's a more consistent season than seasons 12-14 in terms of keeping the zany to a minimum and focusing on episodes with better plots and pacing.

As for the packaging:  Yeah, it's not the best, but I bought some of those white DVD/CD sleeves, put the DVDs in those, and put them in the set (4 discs fit nicely if you put the last one in the booklet slot).  I've done that since they started this type of packaging and haven't had any problems at all.

5322242,5,B009DW5X0I,"""The Simpsons: The Fifteenth Season"" is a four-disc Blu-ray set featuring 22 complete episodes.  Special features include a special introduction by series creator Matt Groening, deleted scenes, animated showcase, sketch galleries, and unique, Blu-ray-only episodes.  Guest star voices include J.K. Rowling, Simon Cowell, and Glenn Close.

The writing is as sharp and hysterical as usual with frequent references to pop culture, political figures, current events, and the assorted foibles of the human race.  Homer still plods through life, childlike, finding himself in one surreal predicament after another.  ""The Simpsons"" features some of the best comedy writing on television.

""The Simpsons"" premiered as a brief segment on the live-action ""Tracey Ullman Show"" in April, 1987.  After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for the Fox Network.  Since its debut on December 17, 1989, ""The Simpsons"" has broadcast over 500 episodes and began its 24th season in September, 2012.",1355270400,2,1040,5.49685534591195

All four DVDs came heavily scratched new.  The discs are made at Cinram's DVD facility in Olyphant,PA.  I called Fox and they told me to return the discs to the store.  All the sets were like this at the store.  I ended up with the Blu-Ray set which comes in a proper plastic case that actually protects.

Bunch of hypocrites at Fox for this so-called eco packaging that can't be recycled (laminated gloss paperboard), isn't durable, and doesn't protect the discs.  Saves no CO2, as how many of us waste our time and gas to return this stuff, let alone put it an plastic case to prevent further damage.

PUT THEM IN PLASTIC CASES!!!  I am tired of getting ripped off.

I don't want to hear about not reviewing the content and just the packaging.  If the discs don't work, it is not a legitmate, viable product.

5322246,4,B009DW5X0I,"Barely a month ago, I wrote a review for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirteenth-Season/dp/B003KZ27N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirteenth Season</a>&nbsp;DVD set. In that review, I lamented over the decline of quality of the show and even declared I likely wouldn't buy another set. Of course, one should never say never (or likely never) because I bought another Simpsons DVD set. Yeah, I couldn't help myself. Maybe it was the shiny green box or the fact that there were only two copies left at Target that made me backtrack, but I bought it and shockingly I'm kinda glad I did.

The 15th season is actually pretty solid. No, it's not like the show used to be in its hay day, but there are still some funny episodes in this season. In fact, I found the 15th season to be a lot better than the 13th and 14th. It's a little more crass but it almost has that old goofy feeling it used to have. There are still some dud episodes, namely, ""Today, I Am a Clown"", ""Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays"" and ""Smart and Smarter"". The episodes aren't terrible, I just don't find most Marge centered episodes to be terribly funny and Krusty can be grating for 22 solid minutes. The ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"" is also a bit weak. The first segment featuring Homer as Death is funny as is the parody of classic Twilight Zone episode ""A Kind of a Stopwatch"" featuring Bart and Milhouse, but the segment featuring Professor Frink's, ""Frinkenstein"", falls flat. Like Krusty, Professor Frink is one of those characters who is mildly amusing in small doses. There is a reason why those characters are supporting - they're really not funny enough to carry more than five minutes of an episode.

The stronger episodes of this season are ""'Tis the Fifteenth Season"", ""Diatribe of a Mad Housewife"" (mainly for the subplot of Homer becoming an unqualified ambulance driver), and ""Margical History Tour"". I usually don't like the episodes where historical stories are parodied but the ""Margical History Tour"" episode works for some reason. ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"" is also an entertaining episode because it's always funny when Homer gets grievously injured while attempting to be selfless. The subplot about Lisa's never ending line of dying cats is a bit boring (which is why it's probably a subplot). The only funny aspect of that subplot is when Dr. Hibbert references his Kool & The Gang car air freshener. It is such a random reference that it never fails to make me laugh (and really, really wish there were real Kool & The Gang car air fresheners. Yes, I have looked).

The 15th season DVD set is still housed in the same dopey packaging as the 13th and 14th season. Instead of housing the discs in a box that you can simply slip the sleeve out of, there's a flap which must be lifted up. The flap idea is just odd to me because it's obvious it will wear out over time. A minor point really, but I don't understand why whomever makes the packaging choice sticks with this idea. I buy a ton of DVD sets and I've never seen this on any other release. There's no danger of the sleeve slipping out so the flap seems like a pointless extra step that doesn't serve a real function.

Despite the packaging aspect, this is still a good release. As I said in my last Simpsons review, my love for the Simpsons waned around the 12th season and I stopped tuning in for new episodes on a weekly basis. I would catch a few episodes here and there, but I wasn't an avid viewer like I was in the past. As such, the majority of these episodes are new-ish to me which is probably why I enjoy most of them. I know a lot of fans have written the series off and refuse to buy the newer seasons because the show is just so horrible now, but I feel like this season is worth a look. There aren't any ""Last Exit To Springfield"" quality episodes, but there are enough funny episodes in this release to remind even us old jaded fans why we fell in love with show.",1354924800,3,4003,4.649717514124294
5322247,4,B009DW5X0I,"I've been a life long ""Simpson's"" fan, and though this season isn't as good as the earlier ones, this season is still very watchable; most episodes are amusing, but some had me laughing out loud. This season was around the time I stopped watching it on television, so some of these I'm seeing for the first time. I would recommend this to any ""Simpson's"" fan.",1354924800,2,359,4.538461538461538
5322248,2,B009DW5X0I,Fox ThinkJam on-line publicity says they are cutting back product/ What/ the dvds are made in Mexico for like 10 cents a- piece. Getting someone to buy a $40 dvd without a review is simply hateful (and devious). Fans complain the seasons are not getting any better- then ThinkJam should be more responsive to publicity requests to alter negative reactions to their precious BD vault!,1354838400,3,383,4.907692307692308
