5353587,5,B009NNMAZI,"As we all know, 'Olympus Has Fallen' just came out a few months ago, but this film is done very differently and every bit as good as Olympus. W.H.D. has a good cast, great suspense & action, even some hilarious one-liners, everything a summer action flick should have. Tatum stars as John Cale, a police officer who wants to have a better relationship with his daughter and become a Secret Service Agent for President James Sawyer (Foxx) While on tour of the White House, terrorists begin to take over. Cale has been separated from his daughter, Emily. Cale must team up with the President and take back the White House by any means necessary. If you want a good action-packed popcorn flick, I highly recommend WHITE HOUSE DOWN!!!",1372550400,4,730,4.7109375
5353588,1,B009NNMAZI,"This is truly the most unrealistic ridiculous movie I have ever seen.  The action, special effects, and acting were the worst I have ever seen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. Just move along.  Nothing to see here.

The movie should have been called White House Down The Drain because if you buy it, you'll be flushing your money down the drain.

What a waste of time and money.",1372464000,24,383,4.352112676056338
5353589,4,B009NNMAZI,"The capital of the United States, Washington D.C., which happens to be one of the most recognizable cities in the entire world, has not fared very well on film in recent memory.  For whatever reason, filmmakers seem to be intrigued with the idea of toying with the famous D.C. buildings and monuments - not to mention the politicians that work there.  In notorious fashion, the White House and D.C. were destroyed in Independence Day by aliens, while the city also took a beating from Mother Nature in the natural disaster film, 2012.  More recently, Cobra Commander conquered the President's mansion from within, ultimately leading to a battle to save the country on the front lawn in G.I. Joe: Retaliation.  Also recently, a former ex-Korean terrorist group stormed the gates of the White House and captured the President of the United States, leading to a devastating battle that severely damaged the White House in Olympus Has Fallen.  Now, just a few months later, the White House and the Capitol building are under attack in the action flick, White House Down.

Directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012), White House Down stars Channing Tatum as John Cale, a US Capital Police officer takes his daughter, Emily (Joey King), to the White House while he applies for a position on the White House Secret Service.  It's business and politics as usual at the White House, at least until President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) is suddenly betrayed by the Head of the Presidential Detail, Martin Walker (James Woods), who blames Sawyer for the death of his son while in Iran on a military mission.  Walker allows a team of American right-wing radicals to occupy the White House, taking several hostages and killing everyone else in the building - except the elusive John Cale.  Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins, and Jimmi Simpson also star in supporting roles.

Obviously, the premise of a film like this is to focus more on the entertainment value and less on it being realistic - so let's just say this now and get it out of the way:  White House Down is far-fetched from the get-go and the scenarios within it are hokey and extremely unlikely.  In any event, movie-goers seem to enjoy the idea of Washington D.C. being occupied and used as a battleground.  However, the difference between this film and the most recent White House action flick, Olympus Has Fallen, is that White House Down pokes fun at the fact that this a fake storyline.  What does that mean exactly?  White House Down features a moderate amount of semi-playful comedy, while Olympus Has Fallen tried to keep a ""straight face"" for the entirety of its tale.  For example, how can you not find humor in the fact that Jamie Foxx's character tries to put together a rocket launcher in the back of a limo while Channing Tatum is driving and doing donuts on the front lawn of the White House?  It just sounds ludicrous to write it, yet it's mostly a serious scene in the film, which obviously takes a few brief moments to be comical, basically embracing the absurdity of the situation.  And, this is just one of the many ironic events throughout the course of the film that makes it so enjoyable.

The cast should also receive quite a bit of credit for making this film enjoyable, along with story-writer James Vanderbilt.  When you first get a glimpse of him in action, Channing Tatum will instantly remind you of Bruce Willis (in his prime) as John McClain.  Since it is an action film, Tatum doesn't offer up very much in the drama department, but he does pull off the role of action star quite well, taking it to the bad guys in Steven Seagal-like fashion.  Tatum's co-star, Jamie Foxx, does his Barack Obama impersonation as a Democrat president that chews Nicotine Gum, has heavy admiration for Abraham Lincoln, and enjoys basketball.  At first, it's difficult to imagine Jamie Foxx as President of the United States, but the Academy Award winning actor quickly puts any doubt to rest and thrives in the role as the leader of the free world.

Even though the star-power is alive and well, the role of the villain is a bit lacking.  James Woods' character is supposed to convince viewers that a man who has devoted his entire career to protecting the President is capable of the highest form of treason.  The character is necessary for the plot in order to let the ""bad guys"" in the front door, but there's really no reason for Wood's character to be preparing for retirement or to be suffering from terminal cancer.  Still, in his eyes - there's no better time for revenge, though not against America, but against the ""evil"" known as the Middle East (where his son was killed in action).  To match Channing Tatum's youth and physicality, Jason Clarke fills the role of the maniacal main henchmen, making for a few knock-down, throw-down scenes between the pair.  A rising star in Hollywood, Clark has been earning himself some fairly prominent roles recently in successful flicks, including Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty, and The Great Gatsby.

Overall, Channing Tatum takes a large stride in his effort to become the next action star, while also adding another successful summer blockbuster to his resume.  Further bright spots in the film include a historical theme of American resiliency, not to mention a patriotic ending that is reminiscent of Jerry Bruckheimer's The Rock.  White House Down would have made the perfect Die Hard sequel with a plot comparable to the original Die Hard (only on a grander scale).  The film is not only full of action, ironic humor, and politics - it also contains quite a bit of informative knowledge about the history of the White House.  While the film does receive high marks for entertainment (and is one of the most entertaining summer blockbuster thus far in the summer of 2013), it still features a recycled plot that's been beaten to death.  Regardless, the positives drown out the negatives, making White House Down a solid, must-see film.

5353590,1,B009NNMAZI,"Copycat redundancies to the recent ""Olympus Has Fallen"" aside, ""White House Down"" is an unintentionally laughable action movie that wallows in involuntary cynicism about how America -- or screenwriter James Vanderbilt at least -- views the White House as the world's biggest crime ring. Buried in a shallow grave just beneath its veneer of absurdly cheesy Americana platitudes lays mocking subtext, twitching with spastic gestures and pointing awkwardly at a corrupt political system eating itself from the inside out. U.S. President Jack William Sawyer (played by Jamie Foxx) can't wait to explain his occupational predicament to the first pair of ears that comes along. ""The first term is all about getting reelected,"" he tells an upstart Secret Service agent before explaining that now, during his second term, he is finally ready to do something that will make a difference. Sound familiar? You'd think he was petitioning for single-term-limits for the Presidential office. Interestingly, the ever-buff Channing Tatum dons the Edward Snowden mantle as John Cale [no, not the Welsh composer and musician of Velvet Underground fame, although that would have been interesting]. Like Snowden, Cale has a history of not finishing things -- e.g., school. But our would-be Secret Service agent bodyguard has friends [mainly female] in high places. He went to college with White House Secret Service official Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one of President Sawyer's right-hand agents. Still, when Cale arrives at the White House for a job interview with Agent Finnerty, with his 12-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) in tow, she quickly gives him the thumbs-down -- so much for friends in high places. Cale is a perfect outlier, ready to pounce for the true cause of liberty when he gets a chance. On this particular day a crew of generic baddies sneak into the White House to hack into its computers, take hostages, and see how far down the line of presidential succession they can move the title of Commander-In-Chief. Naturally, Cale's daughter falls into the hostage category while our able-bodied hero takes personal responsibility for getting the President out alive while all hell breaks out around them. You can't help but transpose Barak Obama into Foxx's character during goofy action sequences, as when Cale and President Sawyer climb up through an elevator shaft. The effect is mildly comical if only because it's so hard to imagine Obama doing anything so remotely athletic and risky. Although its plot gymnastics are idiotic to the point of parody, ""White House Down"" makes a smart point about how vicious, cunning, and vengeful America's power-hungry politicians are. They all want to be king for a day, and don't give a damn about how many civilians get crushed, punished, or put out of work and home in the process. The best thing this cinematic assault-on-the-senses has going for it is its title. Like Edward Snowden, America is on its own and there are very few places to hide.",1372377600,8,2993,5.160493827160494
5353591,4,B009NNMAZI,"Can a movie be preposterous and involving at the same time? Start with a fellow who has just been rejected for a Secret Service job at the White House and his little girl who was thrilled to go along with Daddy to this storied place, as they are swept into a hosted White House tour. Now mix in some high level terrorists capturing the White House with ruthless violence and the answer is ""Yes"" for one simple reason: We have someone to root for.

This PG-13 outing directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" this guy LOVES to blow up the White House!) is another CGI-fest that has an adequate (but predictable) 100-minute story that is beefed up to 131 minutes with endless gunfights, fist fights and blowie uppie stuff. Granted there must be some fighting, given the topic, but enough is enough!

These folks did a fine job:
  * Channing Tatum (""Magic Mike"") is Cale, the fellow who takes his daughter with him to the White House. Cale is a veteran of three tours in the mid-East, so he is no stranger to military tactics.
  * Jamie Foxx (""Django"") is President Sawyer, earnest and frightened but dedicated to the IDEA of America, not to just one individual.
  * Joey King (""Ramona and Beezus"") is Emily, a little girl with a cell phone. She gets separated from Daddy and is scared to death when she sees what's happening, but she's made of pretty stern stuff.
  * Maggie Gyllenhaal (""Hysteria"") is Finerty, an official with the Secret Service; she has just rejected Cale for that security job.
  * James Woods (""Jobs"") is Walker, the head of the agency. He is smart and focused, but may be ill....
  * Michael Murphy (Lots of TV) is Vice President Hammond, whisked off to Air Force One for safe keeping.
  * Richard Jenkins (""Jack Reacher"") is Raphelson, Speaker of the House. If the President and Vice President are annihilated, the Constitution says this modest fellow is next in line.
  * Jason Clarke (""The Great Gatsby"") is once again, extremely effective as a bad guy. Stentz is a paramilitary leader, powerful, smart and determined to win this audacious power grab.
  * Nicolas Wright (Lots of TV) provides delicious bits of humor as Donnie the Guide, a gabby fellow who leads White House tours.

Despite over-the-top violence, we enjoy little bits of humor and appreciate the in-depth tour of the White House. Brace yourself for unexpected twists, some unwelcome political bias, no sweaty bodies and surprisingly little profanity. Be aware that key plot points are whispered while victims are hiding from armed thugs, so if you have any hearing problems, find a theater that offers closed captions, or wait for the DVD from Amazon.

Always remember to suspend disbelief!",1372204800,13,2686,4.780911062906725
5353592,4,B009NNMAZI,"I had the opportunity to see this movie as a screener tonight and I was hesitant about going...  I had tickets for both World War Z and White House Down this week but, I knew I could only go to one so I played the odds and managed to get in on the showing.

Let me say that this is a Hollywood propaganda piece for sure and yes it mostly tries to paint the Right Wing as a war machine run by Radicals who sleep with their guns.  Honestly, I'm neither a Republican nor a Democrat and I have yet to actually cast my vote for a man whose won the white house (yes I seem to have bet on guys that didn't win) but, I go to movies for an escape from reality and Hollyweird needs to get away from the political BS.

Okay, with all that out of the way, John Cale (Played by Channing Tatum) is a man on security detail for the Speaker of the House and he's trying to get back into his daughter's life while interviewing for a job in the Secret Service.  One thing leads to another and he doesn't get the job but, ends up taking his daughter on a tour of the white house.  Well, an extremist group sets into motion a distraction at the capital building that has everybody looking that way while the head of security at the WhiteHouse sets a plan in motion to eliminate the Anti-War President (played by Jamie Foxx and there's more to it than that but, you can find that out by seeing the movie).  Well, somehow John Cale ends up the being the only man that stands between the extremists and the president and he gets to do an on the Job interview that is as enjoyable, sometimes hilarious, and action packed as any movie in recent years.

Let me just say, this really is Die Hard for the new generation, it is a throw back to when movies were movies and they did an excellent job with the story and production in spite of the political skewing.  I honestly feel there's only one other movie I enjoyed this much in 2013 and that was Star Trek Into Darkness so, it really shows you how highly I think of this movie as the Star Trek was easily my favorite movie of the year.

Overall, I would give it 5 stars but, I had to take it down a peg for ruining my entertainment with politics.  So, if you love the original Die Hard, you're going to love this movie as they really do not make them like this anymore (or at least not very often)!",1371686400,128,2323,4.117256637168142

Incidentally, what I ordered was this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-House-Down/dp/B00A2H9P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White House Down</a>

In all, I'm not unsatisfied enough by that to return it (plus I needed it for Christmas).  I chose what I did because I only wanted White House Down (the excessive swearing in Olympus is distracting to me).  But my husband also really likes that movie, so I guess I won't complain too much.  The other thing is I paid more to get just WHD.  The combo pack was cheaper.

The tour guide with the German clock - totally hilarious!!!  That and the ""Hey!! You didn't hire me, remember!???""  Hahaha - boom.
Disclaimer:  Tatum is fairly easy to watch (i.e. looks good), especially after being beat to h*ll and back about 12x (in a hour), without even a bruise or broken bone, much less any puffiness or swelling about the head and face. Nose is intact, too. Go figure.",1489881600,,661,4.900900900900901

5353830,5,B009NNMAZI,"I almost passed this by since I had purchased Olympus Has Fallen last year and they seemed so similar but I am glad I did.  While dealing with the same basic theme this is an entirely different venue.  It is a good movie and I actually watched it twice on back to back days it was that good. This is one of those that will find it's way out every 3 or 4 months for another viewing.

The action was good, the cast excellent, and the real life struggles and issues believable.  The character portrayals were excellent and each actor/actresses excelled in their role.  The decisions made by the cast were believable and realistic making the movie more realistic. None of this pie in the sky last minute radical off the wall improbable decision.

Even with the violence this is a good family night movie if you have slightly older kids.  The President, SS lady, the dad and Emily all performed as befitting their roles in the movie. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves action films.  You will not be disappointed.",1486252800,6,1023,4.521739130434782

I saw this film in the theatre and have watched it another dozen times on cable. Maggie Gyllengaal and James Wood round out a sterling cast. Loads of fun if you like the action genre, as I do. Not too much gore to throw me over the edge, but a great plot and good dialogue. Just the things I have grown to expect from Mr. Emmerich as a director (""Independence Day,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" ""2012,"" etc.).",1483920000,,538,4.444444444444445

It had lots of action, explosions, and humor. Plus it had Channing Tatum. What's not to like? His portrayal of John Cale was awesome and very believable. I don't know if Jamie Foxx would have been my choice for the President, but mostly because I kept thinking of him as ""Jamie Foxx"" and not his character. The Emily character was great. I especially loved her big scene towards the end of the movie. I'm also glad this was not some majorly intense, gritty movie. I needed something to get my mind off the stress of the day without being really heavy. This movie fit the bill perfectly.

I was on the edge of my seat. Tatum was bullet proof, and he did most of his own stunts.
The bad guys were really, truly bad, and they killed man did they leave a body count. Which was so odd, when one of their own got killed, the leader go so emotional. Yet like he said, Walker was willing to destroy the known world for the loss of his son, yet he couldn't kill one man for the loss of his man.

5354089,2,B009NNMAZI,"First it is impossible to not compare this to Olympus Has Fallen (OHF) because both movies are similar in story, with basically the same thing happening.  Both movies were trying to be DIE HARD at the White House, and really only OHF was close to the mark.  The problem with this movie is that it continued to insult my intelligence throughout the film and I felt I was rolling my eyes more often than not at how ridiculous the situations were.  Don't get me wrong, OHF was no master piece either, and that film also had some eye rolling moments as well.  OHF was just a better movie.  It had better actors and dare I say felt more believable.  This movie was also not as entertaining as OHF, so I would recommend that movie over this one.  It's really more of a 2 1/2 star than a 2 star.",1471996800,,788,4.248322147651007

Even with being able to predict or guess in some parts what might happen, it was a great movie. The graphics seemed a bit too unrealistic and I believe a better job could have been done with them, but it didn't take much away from the movie.
I loved how much intensity there was and how relatable the plot was. You really feel for the dad who is torn between finding his daughter and protecting the U.S. President. There is also some history involved, as well as comedy so it is not just an action drama, but something much more.

The little girl in the movie, Joey King, was *Fantastic!  But honestly, I had to laugh out loud at a couple of the scenarios.

Plus, I love how comedic remarks and real White House facts were added to the movie itself. Only issue I have with the movie is the feasibility of completely capturing the White House as it's the most secure property in the United States.

For the most part it's decent enough, but every once in a while there is a moment that is too lame and ridiculous. I probably liked 80% of the movie, but the 20% I didn't like, was bad enough to lower it to 3 stars.

Channing Tatum is not only a pretty face it turns out-he can actually act; however after seeing a few of his movies, I muse that he seems to have the same affect no matter the role. Perhaps he is just a cool guy or perhaps they are giving him roles that present his own disposition well.

5354736,2,B009NNMAZI,"I started watching this because the White House was the backdrop. It started out realistically enough and then as the story progressed, it became ridiculous. Maggie Gyllenhaal's character was a joke, not much emotion there, acting like the local library caught on fire instead of the attempted total destruction of the White House and execution of so many top officials. The movie was too long and too intense. And then, after horrific events, the ending sees the characters acting like they are in a Disney movie. Just too silly.",1440892800,,530,4.966292134831461

5354756,5,B009NNMAZI,I was really impressed with  Channing Tatum and Jamie Fox by how well and believable they made White House Down. The action and special effects were outstanding and the secrets from the White House were brought into the story and the hunt for the President and the police officer as they dodge the bad guys and unknown traitors in the rank and file. Yes the theme was a stretch and how a world class hacker forget how to disarm the explosives he designed boggles the mind but there were traitors and people who had their own agenda so maybe changed the bomb codes. Follow the story as you see a power play for the White House and who was one of the villains hiding in plain sight. A very fun and thrilling ride and a movie story being told.,1440201600,2,740,4.323741007194244

5354762,1,B009NNMAZI,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this dumb.  I liked Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street, but he's not an action star.  He was bland in GI Joe, Jupiter Ascending, and White House Down.  Three strikes for me.  However, he's far from the only problem.  I can overlook a ridiculous plot and story if the it's still entertaining, but every scene in this movie generated the same thought... ""Are you kidding me?""  How can every situation and every character be so dumb?  If you love Obama and hate republicans, this movie is for you.  Foxx is essentially Obama, and the bad guy is the speaker of the house.  Oh, and Iran agrees to the President's peace plan because he's such a good guy.  Sorry about that, spoiler alert.  If you want to see the White House under attack, check out Olympus has Fallen.  It's a far more competent pop corn movie.",1439856000,,849,4.406451612903226

It is a classic Hollywood flick with all the predictable fare, however, it had its moments.  The writing could have been a bit better since there were a number of missed opportunities for snappy quips or witty responses that would have made this a more memorable film.  I did like the Fox/Tatum combo.  They had a fun energy together.  Watch this for the action scenes, patriotic fervor, and multiple twists.  Perfect July 4th movie.",1436140800,,563,4.742268041237113

You deal with the White House being under attack because of inside men plotting against the President. It has more levity to it than Olympus Has Fallen which is not a bad thing, it works for the actors and movie.

I advise if you plan on watching this and Olympus Has Fallen, then watch this first. After you watch leave your review then watch Olympus Has Fallen. This is just my opinion, as all reviews are. I might have more bias because I feel Gerard Butler is better at these types of films than Channing Tatum.

5354937,4,B009NNMAZI,I did darken the colours on my TV to give a more dramatic effect to this otherwise comedic action misfire. There are certain parts like the helicopters flying over etc that looks very artificial and the rest of the studio works is visible to the point of 1950's movie. They could've done better in constructing the story and look of the movie. Shame.,1431475200,,350,4.571428571428571

5354960,1,B009NNMAZI,"What? No negative ""Stars""? Oh well, I'll give it a 1 Star since I can't give it a zero.

An absolute turd-fest. I was going to buy this ""movie"", but I happened to catch it on encore while home sick with the flu. Believe me, I would rather endure 4 more weeks of the flu than be subjected to watching this crapfest of a movie ever again.

I can't think of one character in the movie who didn't want to make me hurl my Campbell's chicken noodle soup onto the TV screen. Obviously, ""Director"" Roland Emmerich does not tire from retreading the typical crap he is famous for, and blatant cliches. Of course in typical Liberal fashion, we have to divert from the realities of world events and once again make the white neo-nazi, ex-military, expatriated, military industrial complex, racists, and bigots the ""Villain"".

Then there is the Protagonist, John Cale (Channing Tatum). A wannabe Secret Service Agent who wants to be on the President's protection detail. We watch this know-it-all throughout the film performing spectacular feats of defense tactics, technical know how, and marksmanship...until it really counts. Case in point; In one scene, rogue Secret Service Agent Walker (James Woods) is holding the President at gunpoint. Wannabe Cale is a mere 30 feet away (undetected) from them in a position of advantage (up on a catwalk) with, what appears to be, an M416 with an HD-33 optical sight. Our superhero is so good, he can't shoot Walker, but manages to spray bullets all over the place almost hitting the President (Like to see that Secret Service test review - Almost shooting the POTUS. - FAIL!), Time and again through the movie, Cale can't seem to put bullets on target when it's really needed.

Then of course there is his know-it-all daughter, who is so annoying, you are hoping the terrorists would shoot her (they manage to kill everyone else without a reason) Obviously she is the link to the Youtube/Twitter/Facebook/pain-in-the-ass generation for the movie.

""Director"" Emmerich also tosses in the complete workings of ineptness of the United States Government. The ""good"" Secret Service Agents are portrayed as the Keystone Kops. The Army apparently have M1A2 Abrams tanks with no armor since a single RPG has the ability to destroy an Abrams with a direct frontal shot (palm to forehead). The ""Special Ops Guys"" (supposedly Navy SEALs from Team 6 - yes the ones who took out Osama bin Laden) appear to be the crew from McHale's Navy.

Lest we forget President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). This is ""Director"" Emmerichs' salute to President Obama. President Sawyer is the Pie-in-the-sky type who thinks his just very ""being"" will end World strife (kind of like someone we know). Of course we can't let pass an opportunity for the typical references that a black President has to have some ""hood"" in him and ""street cred"". I can feel the vomit in the back of my throat now.

I could go on and on of how stupid this movie was, but the flu is hitting hard. I can't wait for the next round of diarrhea, it will be easier to handle than watching this ""movie"" again.",1430438400,15,3072,4.7740112994350286

5355121,2,B009NNMAZI,"White House Down
 Channing Tatum starred in the thus far two episodes of G.I. Joe.  Both films were very expensive to produce but managed to be commercially successful.  Artistically, they were rubbish with comic book absurdities and a barely coherent story line.  Add White House Down to the list of Tatums shame.  If you just want to go to the movies on a hot day and see people get shot and things blow up, be my guest.  We are lucky that we have six choices on any given day at our own local movie house.
 I think Tatum can actually be an actor but he seems more likely to become a movie star until the public tires of him, as it will.  His real forte in my mind is romantic roles like The Vow and Dear John.  His romantic leading roles are simpler and less costly to produce and on a dollar for dollar basis are more rewarding financially.  I hope his handlers can put him into films that are more worthy of his talents.  He can play an action hero but it is best to be in a good action film, not this one.
 The producers spent a staggering $150 million on this movie, which debuted at number four this weekend with a $26 million take.  This does not bode well.  Director Ronald Emmerich (The Patriot, Independence Day) knows how to make an exceptional film.  I think the producers and the focus group nerds overrode his experience and insight.  Why else would a guy seeking a job as a secret service agent show up for his interview with his tie loose around his neck?  Perhaps because that image appeals to his young teen female fans?
  Jammie Foxx is the President and leader in distress.  He is also ill used.  Maggie Gyllenhaal does her professional best as a high level secret service official.  James Woods has the best opportunity as the bad guy.  It is not a good idea to have a superb actor as the baddie and a limited or poorly directed and scripted actor as the hero.
 And there are childish mistakes in the action sequences.  James Vanderbilt is responsible for the script.  He has had some great work with The Amazing Spiderman and The Rundown but swings and misses here. Vanderbilt is also among the producers.  He must be hoping hard that he will get his money back.
 I also don't appreciate that we are in a decades long struggle with a radical Islamic outfit but the baddies here are corporate America, semi-literate skin heads and a nut job with a wish to nuke somebody.  Its like making a World War II movie with Canada as the enemy.
 This PG-13 time waster lasts a good long two hours and 17 minutes of air conditioned entertainment.  It scrapes by with a marginal two saw blades.  For the real deal, rent Olympus Has Fallen from earlier this year.  It is just about the same story but a much better movie.",1425513600,,2731,4.387225548902196

5355259,3,B009NNMAZI,"A comedy-action movie that didn't find it's footing in either genre. The plot holes and utter silliness of the whole story made it impossible to suspend disbelief - I pray they didn't hire a military advisor on this film, as he or she must have been in the motor pool during their career. This movie is great, though, for 6-12 year old boys and girls. Any older than that and the entire movie will be a wasted viewing. Unless, that is, the viewer is comatose or heavily sedated.

For something similar, but slightly - slightly - more believable, check out Olympus Has Fallen.",1419984000,4,575,4.58252427184466

5355277,4,B009NNMAZI,"As I write this review there are approximately 1,275 reviews for this movie that average it out to 4 stars.  Then there's ""Olympus Has Fallen"", that other similarly themed ""White House/ President is under attack"" movie, with roughly 2,200 reviews that also average it out to 4 stars.  But one of these movies is clearly superior to the other and it's due in no small part to the charisma that leads Channing Tatum (who plays the reluctant hero Cale and whose child is also threatened just like the plot of OHF) and Jamie Foxx (who plays President Sawyer with just a wink of mischief) bring to the screen.

The plot adheres closely to the plot of ""Die Hard""; an armed group of men storm a building bluffing about what they want when they really want $$, or business connections that can bring about $$, and an off-duty cop (Cale) who has tried to get a job with the Secret Service but failed finds himself protecting the PODUS and some innocent civilians, including one of his loved ones who shows a great deal of resourcefulness and is a pain in the terrorist's side, while trapped in a great big building.  While this doesn't have quite the verve, zim, and sass of ""Die Hard"" one can forgive it because it's PG-13.  This movie succeeds because it's fun and the action is exciting even if you can see the plot coming from around the corner.",1419638400,,1340,4.520661157024794

5355279,4,B009NNMAZI,"This is a movie that requires some compartmentalization; while the action sequences are interesting and somewhat creative, the story line is rather predictable and has too many stereotypical characters in key roles. It has a blatant political agenda which promotes the progressive/liberal point of view but if one can set that to one side, the movie has some entertainment value.

It reminded me of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" which also had a blatant political agenda but was sufficiently entertaing to rise above the  very obvious message of global warming. White House Down is an obvious attack on the terrible ""military/industrial"" complex which attempts to do terrible things to the country and the world.

The movie's answer to the world's problems is lets talk about it. Provided you have the ability to set the politics aside, you may have some fun with this one.",1419552000,,868,5.055944055944056

5355357,2,B009NNMAZI,"What the movie's about:  In a nutshell, an mysterious group of people take over the white house.  One former soldier who is kind of a screw up works to protect the president from the bad guys.

My Rating:  Minus one star for the O-bot propaganda and minus two stars because I'm a bit picky on action movies and like them to stay as realistic as possible. (I understand that with most action movies it's tough to be completely realistic)

Now I'll explain:

The bad guys in the movie are a group of people completely unlikely to do something like this.  White supremacists and ex special forces?  If you think it's likely that a white supremacist would be involved in something like this, I want you to consider how often you hear about one being even as zealous as to attack a policeman whose black.  But they're going to go after the president?  Yeah right...  Ex special forces?  These men worked hard to achieve an elite level in the US military to serve their country but they're going to betray their country by attacking the white house?  Not likely.  And the evil master mind behind everything is the ""Weeper of the House,"" John Boehner?  (Different name in the movie)  I laughed for a couple days at the pure ridiculousness of that.

And then there's some little things that bothered me.  For example, an RPG would NEVER be able to damage an M1 Abram like it did in the movie.  Another example is it's extremely unlikely an ex regular army screw up would be able to take on an ex special forces soldier in hand to hand combat.

Little things like that which took away the realism of the movie and made me lower the rating.",1416528000,,1630,4.479591836734694

5355362,1,B009NNMAZI,"Go watch ""Olympus Has Fallen"" then watch ""White House Down."" Olympus is generally apolitical and has a believable foreign foe. White House is packed with political tripe and features a very predictable ""white right wing racist"" enemy. Honestly, does Hollywood think viewers want to pay to be preached to? Is its message so oblique that it has to stuff it down our throats at every opportunity? Olympus wins in a head-to-head comparison.

5355424,3,B009NNMAZI,"It would be easy to dismiss WHITE HOUSE DOWN as another wish-fulfilling thriller in which an apparently indestructible hero John Cale (Channing Tatum) takes on a group of insurrectionists who take over the Capitol Building and the White House and outmaneuvers them all.  Despite many gun-battles, no one can apparently hit him; on the other hand, he is such a crack shot that he mows down his enemies at will.

On the other hand, Roland Emmerich's action-packed film makes some important points about contemporary politics.  It shows the rivalry at the heart of government, where the cabinet apparently supports President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx), yet schemes behind his back to frustrate his desires for peace in the Middle East.  The about-to-retire head of the Secret Service Walker (James Woods) is particularly resentful of the President's apparently liberal stance, which provokes him to take matters into his own hands, even if he risks committing treason by doing so.  Vice President Hammond (Michael Murphy) proves equally treacherous; it seems that personal ambition transcends his responsibility to the nation.

WHITE HOUSE DOWN takes a skeptical attitude towards capitalism and its consequences.  It seems that financial gain transcends everything in some politicians' minds, even if it means the potential destruction of large parts of the globe.  President Sawyer embraces a refreshingly liberal approach towards his job; but Emmerich suggests that his task is often a lonely one, often without the support of any of his so-called Cabinet 'colleagues.'

Perhaps contemporary politics has rendered the film's liberal message rather obsolete: the vision of peace involving Russia and most territories within the Middle East seems a bit remote in light of Russia's policies in Ukraine as well as ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.  Nonetheless WHITE HOUSE DOWN is still worth a look, if only for Foxx's performance as the President.",1412985600,,1940,5.3519736842105265

The action was fun to watch, though as in most action flicks much of the action is either implausible in real life if not impossible.
If you like action movies, And Don't mind Gigantic holes in the plot, you'll like this. Focusing on the agent & his kid that help save the day is fine, but to completely leave out ANY concern of the President (J. Fox) for his family, leaving him to completely dismiss their importance in his life & vice versa was a ridiculous way to end the film:  He's portrayed as focused only on doing his paid job, and being moved to a new location w/ his new protector and that person's daughter, w/o Amy regard to his Family... It was an insult to the role of the President, and left too many gaps in the film to allow mr to truly enjoy this film.",1411171200,,867,4.191616766467066

5355510,3,B009NNMAZI,"Honestly, I don't understand all the 5-star or even 4-star ratings.  I am addicted to sci-fi and action films, and I have sat through (and even enjoyed) more mediocre SyFy Channel original movies than I care to admit, but I was tempted to stop watching this movie halfway through.  I am more than willing to suspend belief if the plot is at least remotely possible, but this script was far too much of a stretch and utterly predictable.  Special effects were good, and I love an adrenaline rush as much as anyone, but I need more -- as in a logical story line and at least reasonable acting.  While I generally like Jamie Foxx (aside from some poor movie choices), his performance here is leaden.  As for Channing Tatum, I have never understood all the fuss.  I guess he qualifies as a hunk, but the guy CAN...NOT...ACT.  SERIOUSLY.  I have routinely avoided anything with Tatum, but I took a chance on this one.  I should have listened to the little voice that said, ""Don't watch this movie - it's Channing Tatum!""  Clearly, the little voice knew better!",1410652800,,1055,4.593582887700535

5355717,1,B009NNMAZI,"POLITICAL INDICATORS
Did you ever noticed that this movie slaughtered Delta Force and the other one, ""Olympus Has Fallen"", massacred SEAL Team 6?

And how about the part in not just in this movie but virtually every movie in dealing with the occupation of war and State Security (aka National Security) that there's always a hasty decision from a General, a war-mongering Secretary of War, of Defense, a conspiracy from ""the Company"", and an industrialist wanting a monopoly in war-fighting technology, etc?

BTW...(SPOILER)... the chief evil enemy that lead the coup in this movie is a passionate War Mongerer... striving to continue the war because (if I quoted him correctly) ""...we must finish the war we started"".  Sounds familiar?

THE ANTI-WAR TREND.
While the action is spectacular, the acting superb, etc, this movie is just one of so many others that indirectly jeers the war, the military, and the war industry (but not the infantrymen as they're often portrayed as unwitting victims of).  It was a growing trend since the 1960's anti-war movement and has continued producing a series of Vietnam War and others movies like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Salvador"", ""The Peace Maker"", etc.  This trend kicked into high gear with Operation Iraqi Freedom with movies like ""Home of the Brave"", ""Why We Fight"", ""Stop-Loss"", etc.

What makes movies like this, Anti-War is that War is never shown in a positive light.  For example, if I were to make a WWII anti-war movie, I would only show the negative side of war; the bizarre experiences, the tragedies, the unintended consequences, the scarred for life warriors, the families suffering from the loss of their loved ones, the futility and the perpetual nature of war, etc and not show the bigger picture; which is, to free Europe, Africa, and Asia from the oppressive and genocidal Axis Powers.

ANTI-WAR PERSUASION
This trend however, is not a spontaneous general phenomena, it is Extreme Liberalism at it's worst for no other in the political spectrum has more hatred for the Military and War than they.  Don't get me wrong, average Liberals are not extreme; they love our service-persons like anyone else but it is a normal thing for Liberals to believe that ""War doesn't solve anything"", ""Make Love, Not War"" and they have a disdain for international corporations.  How much more then the extreme Liberals dominating Hollywood making movies as the ones afore mentioned.  BTW... the hero veteran Army Ranger at first was apolitical, but you'll see him liking the Liberal President in not just the President's sincerity.

BACK TO INDICATORS
Now why have I mentioned Delta Force and SEALs as examples?  It is because hatred for troops have never completely died away.  There are still people who called our returning vets as ""Baby Killers"", ""Murderers"", etc.  Bare also in mind that many of our politicians, teachers, and yes, movie directors as well as actors grew up in the 1950s and 60s.  Some and were sympathetic or part of the anti-war movement.  Given the extremes of Liberal Hollywood, there may be some who actually harbors that sort of  hate.  The only evidence of such hatred are indications here and there but like with many anti-war movies, it can be recognized.  Like I said above, did you notice that in those two movies, the Delta and SEAL Operators were destroyed.  It so happened that both movies share the same theme and both leaned Liberal (this one is clearly) and showed the typical rashness of the Military leadership?  Coincidence?  Perhaps.

THE BIAS AND THE DISHONORED.
I'm not saying that there ought to be movies that glorify war but this move is blatantly biased, heavily towards the Left like most movies and if you watch this movie, you'll also see the portrayal of the Right in a not so likeable fashion which is also common in Hollywood movies as well.  The movie also dishonors the Military, at least towards the Leadership, painting them as typically rash, too quick to pull the trigger to the detriment of the war-fighters under them.

CONCLUSION
This move therefore, I give it a 1 Star for all the reasons above.  It is just another Liberal Anti-War movie.  Any director these days can make dazzling movies; but how many can be fair to both sides and all political spectrum and not shove their politics down our throats?",1405555200,5,4333,4.929752066115703

5355743,1,B009NNMAZI,"Sometimes Im not interested in a movie enough to pay to see it in the theater. When this happens, the public library is particularly useful. The other day, I took out White House Down, released last summer. I don't regret missing it in the movie theater, since it really was the picture of a not-so-special movie.

Ronald Emmerich is semi-famous for directing large-scale blow-crap-up movies that have little in the way of interesting storytelling. 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day were only partially enjoyable, mainly due to the actors chemistry. Spectacle, of course, is a big deal in these movies that are mainly driven by special effects. His movies also tend to have phoned-in screenplays.

""White House Down"" is basically ""Die Hard""-lite, this time with a black president. The untalented box-office sure thing Channing Tatum is John Cale (John McClane - really??), a wannabe secret service agent who happens to be in the right place at the right time when a terrorist attack threatens the president (Jamie Foxx). John must save the day and also rescue his precocious daughter (Joey King) from near certain death.

There is not a single speck of anything remotely original in White House Down. The film goes a few places on the easy chemistry of Tatum and Foxx, but only that can go so far. Tatum is not a good actor. He cant sell the dramatic scenes if his life depended on it. Joey King (the young daughter) is even worse, annoying in every scene, that you almost hope she gets blown up in the films third act.

In an attempt to be politically correct, the president of the United States is an African-American man. Couldnt it have been a woman? I didn't buy Jamie Foxx as the leader of the free world for one second. Put Meryl Streep in as a kind of Hillary Clinton-y character. With someone unexpected like her in this kind of film, it may have almost been worth it.

""White House Down"" has a terrible screenplay, and doesnt inspire any slightly memorable moments. Its all kinds of generic, yet it probably made all kinds of money, because this is just the kind of loud, stupid film that Americans love. If you're looking for something unpredictable, memorable, cinematic, or enjoyable in any way, I say avoid this thing like the plague.

You've seen Die Hard, right? Siege. Guns. Explosions. Wisecracks. Singlet-clad hero plays cat-and-mouse with baddies, keeping in touch with the world outside through walkie-talkie chats with a fellow law-abiding rebel whos been told by superiors to go home. Head terrorist has fearsome and unhinged machinegun-happy lieutenant. Bespectacled tech geek terrorist cracks security while a Beethoven symphony plays. Theres a bit where John hides on top of an elevator; theres a part when gung-ho helicopter dudes are shooting at John on the roof, mistaking him for a terrorist.

What first drew me to the movie is the destruction of the White House and all of the action.  A lot of action!  For those reasons I also enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen.  But I think this movie has the other one beat just because of the main characters daughter being part of the action and the threat.

I couldn't quite bring myself to root for the loathsome bad guys in White House Down, but watching self-important politicians being humiliated (and worse) and incompetent governmental institutions failing was satisfying

I had no patience for the blatant propaganda, less for the drivel-spouting President who is all too familiar; nor the portrayal of the American military as villains; and the implication that only someone with a ""golf-ball size"" brain tumor could have adequate reason to be deeply disappointed with the Federal government

 ""Die Hard"" ripoff but with NONE of the wit, acting, or visual flair.  Lots of explosions, lots of gunfire, lots of vicious violence, and a
fairly incoherent story line that keeps ""twisting"" until by the end you can easily guess who the mystery bad guy is, and you likely
could give a crap. I'm amazed I stuck it out for the whole thing, though I did fast forward a bit.
If Channing Tatum can act, he managed to keep it a secret here. Jamey Foxx seemed pretty uninspired, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was truly awful.  The girl that played the ""feisty"" daughter (yeesh) was pretty annoying, her character was absurd bordering on laughable.  Everyone and everything in this movie was a cliche of a cliche.

5355858,4,B009NNMAZI,"It's pretty much ""DIE HARD"" with a new coat of paint. That's not bad. DIE HARD was the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! This one doesn't rise near that level but it sure tried.  JOHN CALE (Channing Tatum) has come to the White House about a Secret Service job and is slapped down by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Apparently they have history. CALE takes his daughter on a tour to avoid telling her of his rejection. Then all hell breaks loose in a well planned, multi-pronged attack that virtually wipes out the Secret Service detail and Marine Guard. Though I kept wondering where was DELTA FORCE, MARINE FORCE RECON, FBI ""SWAT"" TEAM. It strains the limits of credibility because in real life, every soldier, sailor, Marine, veteran, Federal Agent, Cop and Redneck within a fifty mile radius would've made their way to the scene to protect their country.

Despite the political tone to the script (anti war, anti military/industrial complex) you get a lot of action for your money, great sets and some amazing FX work (you learn more about that on the Blu ray edition than the DVD).
This movie is worth watching several times. My biggest complaints (other than idiotic military tactics- I think Olympus had them too) are that impossibly large hidden basement complex and the amazing (no amount of concrete & steel affected it) cell phone reception.

How any thinking person over the age of 12 could accept this piece of absolute of mindless shlock as even remotely valid entertainment is beyond my ability to imagine.  ""Believeable"" another reviewer said.  On what planet?  I guess if you take it as given that only right-wing extremists could possibly carry out the nefarious schemes of the military-industrial complex and that our entire Secret Service and Military are comprised of brainless buffoons who couldn't find their rear-ends with both hands whilst being outflanked, out-maneuvered and outgunned at every turn by their opponents, then sure.  Rational people with a less skewed worldview see right through ham-handed plot contrivances meant to demean and belittle anyone with a more patriotic way of thinking.

Great movie and loved that it came with DVD & Blue Ray copies. I can see why reviewers are critical of this having come out soon after Olympus has fallen. They are on two completely different levels. This was is clearly meant for the younger crowd and wins them over with tech savvy humor and popular young eye candy-- Tatum. I didn't see OHF first so this was a fun and exciting movie. You can't help but love that Lil brat Emily in the end. I tear up watching her wave that flag.

So this movie is about a father and Daughter on a tour of the white house. The daughter adores the present and is totally into politics. She seems to know more than the average 11 old should. Dad is a Secret Service hopeful. Terrorist are after more than money. Action, explosions, deceit, assignations, epic plane crashes, BIG guns and a little humor. This movie just about has it all. Not a family friendly movie but your older children will like it, my 13 year old did. I would highly recommend this movie for your Action Movie Collection.

The secret service turns him down for very good reasons but he shows them they have made a mistake as Nazi terrorists invade the white house and take it over with the help of the head of the secret service presidential protection detail who is dying of a brain tumor.

There is a lot of action in the movie. Very little of it makes much sense. if you like non-stop action and don't care much if it makes any sense, you might like it more.

It is pretty political as well. People who are to the left of Stalin will appreciate the political tone of the movie, Reaganish people will probably dislike that part of it.

At the end, the middle east peace problem is resolved and we all live happily ever after, I guess. No sequel so maybe the people who did the film are not so happy about it.",1397606400,,1060,4.206896551724138

5355940,5,B009NNMAZI,"There had never been a movie about assassinating a First Lady. And then suddenly with Hillary Clinton as First lady there were several big budget Hollywood features about First Ladies in danger. Nicolas Cage was a secret Service agent, Bruce Willis was a terrorist after the President's wife, etc. It was like 1981 - the year of all the werewolf pictures.

This year we have had two mega disaster movies about terrorists (or whomever) taking over the White House. Last year we had Gerard Butler as the off-payroll Secret Service agent in 'Olympus has Fallen'. This year Channing Tatum is the off-payroll super Secret Service agent.

One wonders why we bother to pay the Secret Service at all. When attacked the pros die like lemmings while some volunteer who just happens to be there saves the day.

The message of these films seems to be - trust the black guys - half of the white guys are traitors. Identify the muscular white hero quickly. He is bulletproof. The White House is quite easy to take over and all sorts of people and groups are interested in trying.

Both films seem to motivated in reaction to the Presidency of Barack Obama. The filmmakers seem to sense that having as feckless and incompetent a President as Obama is likely to bring about revolt and civil insurrection. Of the two this one - ""White House Down"" - is more heavy handed politically. Jamie Foxx last starred in Tarantino's  ""Django Unchained"" where he established an identity as a virulently anti-white murderer. So using a rabid hate monger like Foxx is a strong signal. In the other White House under attack movie they used the more moderate Morgan Freeman and he didn't play the President himself - just a high official.

Roland Emmerich goes to great lengths to exonerate Arabs and Muslims as terrorists. He  has various white militants as the villains. That doesn't make much sense but this isn't the kind of movie that is suppose to actually make sense. Emmerich works a lot of plot gimmicks to assure everyone that this fantasy will be 'politically correct'.  This part of the movie is as lame as when in the last Tom Clancy movie - The Sum of All Fears' - they changed the nuclear terrorists from Muslims to Nazis. In some of the James Bond movies they also for reasons of political correctness changed the villains from Soviets to some worldwide private enterprise terror organization.

Jamie Foxx is obviously playing Obama. He is almost an SNL Obama impersonator. They let Foxx have a couple funny scenes where the humor lies in the audience's realization that he isn't just playing some generic President - he is in fact playing our current President. But Emmerich does not dare to be anything but reverential toward Obama. It would have been much funnier to have had Obama skipping government business so as to play golf or fumbling with a teleprompter.. But Emmerich or the producers are too timid for that. Foxx who in real life seems to be a racial hothead who wants to kill whites, comes across in the script as a rather boring and sanctimonious. The President in these new White House Attack movies is just a tackling dummy - a passive object who must be protected - but who is superfluous to the drama as a person.

So politically this film is mess. That's not the point. This is a mindless action film and it's very, very good at that.",1395964800,,3337,4.688888888888889

5355969,2,B009NNMAZI,"Before I begin, let me say that I am NOT a movie snob. I enjoy Michael Bay films and Steven Seagal flicks. I am happy to suspend disbelief in the name of fantasy. However, some movies just push the envelope until it becomes too ridiculous to watch. ""White House Down"" is one of those films.

The first major flaw of the film is that the script writers borrow too heavily from other material. They basically took the scripts from the Die Hard franchise and ""Air Force One"" and merged them all together.

Secondly, every action film clich is represented: an unexpected hero throws a monkey wrench into bad guys' plans, an inside traitor compromises security and opens the door for a takeover, a bunch of mercenaries who look like meth dealers, a bumbling group of government bureaucrats, a brainiac techno geek working for the bad guys, the hero's loved one is one of the hostages, etc. You could go on for hours.

The third issue is that when your setting and characters are based on real elements, you have to keep a certain level of realism. This movie fails to do that on all levels. America's nuclear arsenal is not like Skynet from ""The Terminator"".  The President cannot arm and launch ballistic missiles from a terminal. Everyone knows that the weapons system is set up so that no one person can unilaterally deploy a nuclear weapon. It's also hard to believe that after the Cold War and 9/11 our government would not have contingency plans to deal with such a scenario.

The plot keeps becoming more unbelievable until it ventures into absurdity. The film almost becomes a comedic parody of itself and other action movies. The climax when the hero crashes an SUV into the Oval Office and mows down the bad guy with a cannon is the icing on the cake. Bottom line: Fiction is acceptable, but excessive plots sometimes reach a breaking point with the audience.",1395446400,,1864,4.670731707317073
5355970,2,B009NNMAZI,"This movie begs for one star ... I had to give it a second star just for the gall of casting Jamie Fox as POTUS. LOL Jamie was believable as a spunky important figure, but not as a President.

As EVERYONE one has noted, this is a poor rip-off of ""Die Hard"", with an additional large spoonful of ""Air Force One"" forced down our throats. It is blatant, right down to the bad guys discovering they have a family member of the hero in their hands by watching the news.

I hope that real Secret Service agents receive better tactical training than depicted in this movie and Air Force One. Because fully exposing yourself to automatic weapons fire by standing in an open hall or doorway is really not the way to go. Well, it is the way to go if by ""go"" you mean get filled with lead.

Frankly, I thought most of the acting was great, but the unfortunate cast had to deliver ridiculous lines in preposterous situations.

Anyone who watched this movie could go on and on about the truly stupid and unbelievable actions and plot elements. I won't. It's too easy and there are FAR too many of them. LOL

Of course, a lot of people don't mind really stupid plots and action, after all, ""Con Air"" even has its fans. LOL

Not recommended, but decide for yourself.",1395446400,,1251,4.370689655172414

I'm also a big fan of Jamie Foxx.  They both played excellent characters in this movie & there was not one second of boredom throughout the entire movie!!!  Although it was not a love story, the chemistry between Tatum & Foxx made the storyline even MORE engaging!!!  When I saw the credits begin to roll, I felt a bit of sadness that this movie was ending & my heart was racing from the excitement I was feeling.  I felt excited throughout this movie & have recommended it to several of my friends.  Although Channing Tatum was the sole reason I initially watched this movie, the movie itself kept me engrossed.  I watched EVERY second of this movie & found it to be a sit on the edge of my seat, bite my nails kind of movie.

Just from the 50,000 ft level, Javelin is an anti tank weapon, it has an anti-helicopter mode, but it's direct fire, not seeking. Also, the lines of succession are well understood and have no room for ""discussion."" Finally, it is HIGHLY unlikely that the 'football' can be used to redirect nuclear assets... And don't get me started on the 'backstory' of a defense industry plot.. Bad movie, poorly conceived, poorly written. I guess I have to add more.. F-22's or any current fighter would never fly over the target area as shown in this movie, they would use a pop up maneuver, or high altitude drop..

The acting is erratic (James Woods brings some class to this mish-mash of actors & vastly differing levels of acting abilities), the plot is not that bad for a takeover-the-White -House/ terrorists from within theme but is not made proper use of, the dialogue is utterly hokey as well as derivative (OK -- you want the best of this genre go see Die Hard. Movies like WHD just demonstrate how hard it is to catch lightning in a bottle-- even for a simple actioner like Die Hard), & I NEVER want to see the cop/FBI/CIA/ whatever the lead plays --their child held as hostage ever again in one of these stupid movies. Maybe it was the ""acting"" of Channing tatum but every time he even thought about his daughter he was like the dog in UP.........""OK Mr President,we've got to move from here or they'll find you...""  ""DaddY??""..................OOOps...........SQUIRREL. (head twist) ""I've got to find her!!""  Hey, he's good enough looking but he just cannot act.  And Jamie Jamie Jamie..........really??!  Did you have to try & sound like our current Prez or did it just happen that way??  I guess my review is like this movie....... all over the place with too many moving parts--I just don;t know why movies like this get made. There are so many scenes that start off great & then get stupid/silly/beyond belief in a hurry........by the end I was laughing because it was just SO bad I mean the daughter is a flag twirler in her talent show so of course at the end of the movie she has to be waving a flag to stop the helicopter attack that will kill everyone in the White House. Did the writers get together and just throw EVERY thing into this movie.......?...YUP.  Look. If you want some truly miind-less entertainment that makes no sense & has a bunch of actors that should know better than to do this & has lots of cool violent guns & rockets & angry bitter Marine/mercenary type dudes.............go for it. And OH.........the smirking assisstant to the VP -- when they learn that the President is dead & his boss is sworn in as the new Pres......& he gets this look of smug satisfaction that HIS guy is FINALLY the President.............maybe this is an accurate depiction of such people but it made me feel scummy .......... Oh yeah -- the attempts at humor are so ill timed that they feel like they were stuck in after the movie was finished because it needed some ""lighter moments"". The tour guide was the best effort at humor & he was mostly just a jerk. ACK........this movie is a real hot mess from start to finish.

Anyway at the Whitehouse he is basically told, you're kidding right, you're a joke, why are you applying by someone who went to school with him but yet was surprised when she recognised him as such, don't they do background checks as part of the Secret Service recruitment? His daughter who hasn't had much respect for him up to then, suddenly is excited about her father once again so on the way out when she begs him to let them tag along on the tourist tour to see more of where he'll be working, of course he doesn't want to kill the fantasy or opinion of him just yet. Unfortunately for them both, there are a group of men who do want to do some killing, which kicks off when the daughter has left the tour group to use a bathroom a floor bellow. Not prepared to leave his daughter alone with bullets firing everywhere, when the tour becomes part of the lockdown, John takes out a terrorist or two while looking for that bathroom. Of course when he gets there his daughter has fled to another area of the White House but the president (played by Fox) is in dire need of his help.

The movie is pretty slow at the beginning (which probably could have been edited down) that does take almost half an hour for the siege at the White House to begin but once it does, it a good non stop action movie, whose action goes on for about an hour and a half after that. I thought the actual taking of the White House was better done in a similar plot rival movie released around the same time Olympus Has Fallen, but this one was a lot more fun and fast paced (and far fetched) than that film once the White House was in the bad guys' control. Like all action movies this has a lot of explosions that obviously don't look a thing like real explosions, nor kill or injure the main characters close enough when they should. Bullets never quite hit their mark on the hero when they are being fired by professionals and things like this. I thought the acting by Joey King who played the daughter Emily, was extremely well done, I even bought Fox as the president most of the time. Tatum's character was a bit less believable than say Bruce Willis was in Die Hard, but still overall he does a decent job and delivers a bit more than just being eye candy for the ladies.

Even though this has some ridiculous scenarios, such as his job interviewer telling him to turn on a news report basically implying his daughter is dead when she needs him to get the president to safety. I still really enjoyed watching it. Good fun to watch action movies are pretty rare these days, this was one of those though.",1392940800,,2893,4.3064220183486235

5356135,4,B009NNMAZI,"Big dumb movies, big dumb blockbuster summer movies are sometimes what I crave. I didn't expect to like WHITE HOUSE DOWN as much as I did. It certainly exemplifies the big dumb movie. What won me over was that the movie wore its loudness and flamboyance and its popcorn creds so proudly. Director Roland Emmerich lifts the swagger of INDEPENDENCE DAY and grafts it into WHITE HOUSE DOWN, and I enjoyed it tremendously, my brain on park, eyes and ears just soaking in the spectacle.

I guess I've warmed up to Channing Tatum; it took a bit. But he was so entertaining in STEP UP and 21 JUMP STREET, he kinda won me over. Here, he plays Capitol cop John Cale whose dream posting on the Secret Service's Presidential detail has just been submarined. Still, he didn't want to disappoint his eleven-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) who accompanied him for his job interview at the White House and who, by the way, is freaky obsessed with all things White House-y. When Emily asks if they could join the White House tour, how could her dad say no?

So, 2013 saw a span of four months in which the White House was invaded by armed paramilitary troops not once but twice. OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN launched in June, WHITE HOUSE DOWN released in August, near enough to each other that competitive juices may have been stoked. Thankfully, despite the overwhelming parallel beats,the two films diverge from each other enough that one can appreciate them as separate animals. Of the two, OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is the more no-nonsense thriller, while WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a hybrid of tension and levity. Believe it or not, I find myself preferring Tatum's John Cale over Gerard Butler's Mike Banning. John Cale isn't as accomplished with the fighty fight as  disgraced former Secret Service agent Mike Banning. Cale isn't as efficient, but his comparative lack of combat polish only humanizes his character more.

Two other things humanize him more: his sense of humor and his relationship with his daughter. Don't twist it now, WHITE HOUSE DOWN can claim the splashy action sequences and massive production values and all that noise, but the heart of the film rests firmly on those moments between Cale and his daughter. This kid, Joey King, is all kinds of amazing. She shines in a series of showcase scenes.

Jamie Foxx almost sold me in his role. As President James William Sawyer, he generates dignity and authority. So it was a bit of a let down when he started clowning around, even though I knew that those antics were his comic bread and butter. But is it worth the laughs a funny expletive generates if the credibility of the role is compromised? But I love the easy-going chemistry between Foxx and Tatum. I'm still confounded that Tatum has turned out to have a flair for comedy. And even though I just laid a dis on Jamie Foxx, I like that, for the most part, he's restrained in his role. I'm also glad that, unlike Harrison Ford, he doesn't suddenly transform into - dunh-dunh-DUNH! - American President, Action Hero.

WHITE HOUSE DOWN unfolds a sweeping plot trajectory. Roland Emmerich really does pull out all the stops. Just when you think he couldn't escalate the situation - bam! - damn thing done escalated. It helps that there's an exemplary supporting cast to keep the ship righted some. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Deputy Special Agent Finnerty who provides outside support for John Cale, never mind that earlier in the day she rejected him for a spot in the Presidential detail. James Woods gets to chew more scenery as Walker, retiring Head of the Secret Service Presidential detail. Nicolas Wright as the dedicated tour guide lightens the mood as a sort of tertiary sidekick.

WHITE HOUSE DOWN, like OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, is worth watching. It checks off the boxes required of a fun big dumb movie. Sure, it's got its chunk of flaws (it is, after all, a big dumb movie). But it's packed with blistering action sets (with Tatum performing most of his own stunts). It's a decent buddy flick that showcases the bromance between POTUS and his suddenly pressed-into-service bodyguard. And it's got Joey King, a born scene stealer if ever I saw one. And if you ever attend a White House tour and you ask if there's a secret tunnel that JFK used to sneak Marilyn Monroe into a tryst and the guide empathically says no, well, this movie would beg to differ. 4 out of 5 stars, surprisingly.

SPOILER ALERT!

1. Crappy action flick knows what it is, therefore it throws in two stars to open their movie, Channing Tatum (for his eye candy-ness) and Jamie Foxx (for the black fans). With this, they grab the chubby house wives, the white viewers and the black viewers. Good job!

2. Involves a child for invoking viewers parental instincts and sentimental purposes. How many action flicks involve a child so they can make the hero look even better. I don't know about you, but I'm disappointed that she survived. Little know it all brat that youtubes and loves the president sooooo much!

3. Terrorists wanting to start WW3 DONE. Terrorists wanting to start WW3 by invading the white house DONE AND DONE.

4. Jamie Foxx trying to be an honorable president with lines like ""I don't want to make history, I just want to make a difference"" and ""if your daughter says I'm the hero, then I gotta earn it""  VOMITS! Okay Mr. Cool Black President...whatever you say.

5. You know that important watch his wife asks him and he says he keeps it close to his heart, guess how that plays into the movie? If you can't predict it from the beginning, then you shouldn't be rating a movie.

6. Guess which bad guy fights Tatum in the end?

The movie industry is trying to throw the most typical action movie with the most overused scenes to see if you guys will eat it up. They don't think highly of you. This is 2013 garbage being shoved your way, are you smart enough to notice it or giggle while you scream mindlessly ""oohhhh it's Tatum he iz so fine!"" or ""ohhh there's explosions 5 stars!"".

This is a blatant bad movie making attempt to test the populus, I truly hope you didn't pay movie prices for this garbage and if you did, I hope you regret it. There were NO attempts WHATSOEVER to give this movie creativity or a twist.

I'm shocked at the positive reviews on this movie, that's why you can't trust the ratings on anything anymore.",1391904000,3,2170,4.524296675191816

5356205,2,B009NNMAZI,"Director Roland Emmerich follows the same successful formula he used for his much better ""Independence Day"" in this much too long action based political thriller.  Keeping up with the times, President James Sawyer is played by Jamie Foxx.  Sawyer is under political fire for reaching a peace arrangement with Iran and plans to withdraw troops throughout the Middle East and other parts of the world.  Little does he know that a coup is underway within the government.  Gee, what a new idea.

Channing Tatum plays Cale, a cop in the Capitol police force and spends most of his time driving Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) around.  It seems Cale, once an active duty Marine, saved Raphelson's son from being killed in Afghanistan.  But Cale, a one-time college dropout and all around goof off, wants more.  Specifically he wants a job with the Secret Service White House detail.

And of course he has disappointed his cute, precocious 11 year old daughter Emily who lives with her mother.  Played by Joey King, Emily is one of the better characters in this movie.  She isn't just along for the ride, but gets in on the action in a realistic way when things start to fall apart.  Although, Cale's interview with the Secret Service agent in charge (Maggie Gyllenhaal) doesn't go well (they are former classmates with a history), Cale gets on the good side of his daughter by getting passes for a White House tour.

Things go haywire when the White House is infiltrated by a goon squad of right wing rednecks, a creepy brainiac geek and a former Army Ranger, all being orchestrated by a powerful insider.  Duh.  The bad guys slaughter everyone paid to protect the building with ease but in a PG-13 sort of way.  You can pretty much guess where this is all going.  Cale and Emily get separated.  The bad guys can't seem to get their automatic, fast firing weapons to hit Cale.  They obviously haven't learned how to lead when firing at someone running or else have set their bullets on slow motion.

In any case Cale manages to get to the president (remember him) before he is taken prisoner.  The bad guys need him alive for negotiating purposes.  While there is no question how this will all end, there is a certain amount of tension involved in the film, as unbelievable as the whole plot is.

This film was originally released in June of 2013, a month or two after a very similar film called ""Olympus Has Fallen"" came out with Gerard Butler in a Cale-like role.  Instead of a daughter, he had a son, who was also in the White House when it was captured.  By North Koreans rather than money hungry American discontents and political rivals.  ""White House Down"" is full of wise cracks along the way, mostly by Foxx and Tatum and a tour guide played by Nicolas Wright.  ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is marginally better in my mind because of Butler.  He's deadly serious.

As flawed as the movie is, the Blu ray transfer is picture perfect in every way.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every scene looks glorious with rich detail, great colors and natural textures.  Skin tones are natural.  Dark scenes look very good with deep black.  Demo grade throughout.  So much so that some of the CGI effects in the film are almost laughable.  The audio track, likewise is demo grade.  The disc uses a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track that is spectacular.  While the gun battles get old, there is no question that the viewer is in on the action.  There are numerous scenes with helicopters, jets, tanks, rocket launchers throughout and the sound is perfectly displayed in the surrounds.  Quieter scenes are also well done.  Some of the spaces in the White House are abandon, so small sounds echo off the walls.  Dialog is clear and concise.  Really well done sonics.  There is a whole list of subtitle options, too numerous to mention here.  There are the extras which are likewise plentiful:

5356206,4,B009NNMAZI,Enjoyed the movie - lots of action - liked the way that it let the hero daughter show that a lot of young people is smart and not trouble maker.  Like the way that it focus on the action non stop.,1391472000,,196,3.7804878048780486
5356207,5,B009NNMAZI,"Awesome, good and excellent from the beginning to the end.  The action was real, believable and intense and worthy of five stars.",1391472000,2,129,4.863636363636363
5356208,5,B009NNMAZI,"Excellent movie! I had a group of girlfriends over for dinner and a movie and we pick this one not knowing anything about it, but with these 2 guys what could go wrong? Indeed! It was fun, suspenseful, action packed, funny, extremely entertaining. Even the language was much better than a lot of the action movies out there! That was a pleasant surprise, wouldn't go as far as saying it's a clean movie, but was much more clean than we expected. The kind of movie that keeps you on edge from beginning to end. Strongly recommend it for a family gathering, a friends over kind of party or just for a night at home on your own. Enjoy it!",1391472000,,635,4.34453781512605
5356209,5,B009NNMAZI,"my movie came in excellent conditions, ever since I saw this movie in the theaters I always wanted to get it. I love this movie because it has a lot of action from beginning to end. thank you so much for your services",1391472000,,217,4.069767441860465
5356210,4,B009NNMAZI,"O really enjoyed this movie, even bought another copy for my son-in-law.  I gave it a four star because the language is a bit harsh at times for a PG-13.",1391385600,,153,4.1
5356211,3,B009NNMAZI,Loved the movie. But was unable to watch it more than once even though my purchase time was not expired.,1391385600,,104,4.25
5356212,4,B009NNMAZI,I enjoy watching movies with Channing and Jamie Fox the only thing wrong with this movie it's just like all the others,1391385600,,118,4.409090909090909
5356213,4,B009NNMAZI,"Plenty of action and a good mix of human interest.  A good deal of what happened is hard to believe,  but we watch movies to escape,  right?",1391385600,,140,4.111111111111111
5356214,1,B009NNMAZI,"Channing Tatum is tougher than Jason Clark (who's ex-delta) who plays the bad guy? Ya sure. Tatum's 11 yr old daughter prevents an air strike on the White House because she is just so darn cute standing on the front lawn. Filled with ridiculous over the top action scenes that includes hundreds of bad guys shots missing our heroes--and all of the heroes killing their targets. Watch ""Olympus has Fallen"" instead; same basic story, done a lot better and at least watchable--this is just stupid.",1391299200,4,494,4.823529411764706
5356235,2,B009NNMAZI,Wasn't as good as I thought it would be . Olympus has fallen was better a lot more action and kept me glued to the screen.,1391299200,,122,3.730769230769231
5356236,2,B009NNMAZI,"This movie was a big disappointment.  Big dumb gaps in the story.  The action sequences don't make up for them.  I saw Olympus Has Fallen, expecting it to be worse and it was much better.",1391299200,,187,4.285714285714286
5356237,1,B009NNMAZI,"This movie is all about special effects, killing, corruption at the highest levels in government [who, us?], is simple-minded -- the bad guys get ahead of the entire government, including the National Guard, and, of course, the White House cops, Secret Service, etc., and is enormously insulting to anyone's intelligence. I watched it because my husband wanted to see it as he likes action flicks and he has Parkinson's but even he said it was pretty bad. Jamie Foxx is a pseudo Obama...and that seems more than mildly racist as well...the Prez has the entire Military-Industrial complex against him? How completely sour is that? Avoid like the plague.",1391212800,2,652,5.046296296296297
5356238,5,B009NNMAZI,The movie White House Down is an excellent movie to watch. You should buy it and watch it. This the best movie.,1391212800,,111,4.090909090909091
5356239,4,B009NNMAZI,It was an entertaining movie and suspenseful until the end.  There was a surprise ending just when you thought all was lost.,1391126400,,124,4.636363636363637
5356240,5,B009NNMAZI,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Good action and really moved along.  Little far fetched, but really entertaining.  Will watch it again",1391126400,,131,4.863636363636363
5356241,3,B009NNMAZI,"If our government is as vulnerable as made out in this movie, then we all should be building bunkers in our back yards! While a plausible plot, the 'terrorists' gain access to too many critical government operations all too easy (in my opinion). As predicted, a single individual manages to save the entire country.",1391126400,,315,4.851851851851852
5356242,2,B009NNMAZI,Some decent visual effects but the story line and acting were mediocre at best. James Woods is always a treat.,1391126400,,110,4.55
5356243,3,B009NNMAZI,Enjoyed the movie. Light entertainment. Would not pay to see in movie theater but good for rental. Recommend for action rental.,1391126400,,127,5.095238095238095
5356244,5,B009NNMAZI,"This action drama actually kept me awake and on the edge of my seat through the entire movie which is really something for
someone who has a hard time staying up beyond her bedtime.",1391040000,,181,4.352941176470588
5356255,5,B009NNMAZI,"To be honest, this is far from realistic, and the events are over-the-top crazy, but this is an entertaining movie. Channing Tatum is not a great actor (in my opinion), but he did a terrific job in this movie. He's great with the action, and his interaction with his movie daughter is sweet. Jamie Foxx is always a fan favorite, and he doesn't fail to deliver. I even like the addition of his sneakers thrown in. If you're expecting a movie that realistically conveys what might happen when good guys go bad and want to overtake the white house, look elsewhere. If you want some laughs, a bit of drama, and a lot of action, then I recommend this movie. As for content, it's an action flick, so expect that, but I recall very little language--only one or two instances. If there was more, I didn't notice, and I tend to notice those things.",1391040000,2,839,4.454545454545454
5356256,3,B009NNMAZI,"Lots of action and things blown up and stuff like that. Highly improbable plot. I typically like movies of this type, but this one stretches the story. Still I rate it as ""OK"".",1391040000,,176,4.363636363636363
5356257,3,B009NNMAZI,"Gave it 3 stars, because I would not say ""I Hate It"" or ""I don't like it"". Was it good? No. Would I watch it again. Uh, no way. But was I entertained by the stupidity of it for a night at home on the couch? Sure.",1391040000,,212,3.5319148936170213
5356258,3,B009NNMAZI,"Lot of shooting,lots of killing. totally does not make any sense can,t believe Fox would be in such a rediculous flim",1391040000,,117,4.619047619047619
5356259,5,B009NNMAZI,Lots of action.  Great movie.  Really enjoyed watching it with my husband.  Ladies your husbands will enjoy watching this with you.  Very suspensful.,1391040000,,149,5.3478260869565215
5356260,5,B009NNMAZI,"Great movie, loved the excitement and fast paced surprises.  The special effects are great and it keeps you wondering about who is behind the disaster.",1391040000,,151,5.04
5356261,2,B009NNMAZI,"Bad guys storm the White House and nobody comes to the rescue?  Huh?  And when they do, a handful of bad guys defeat the Army, Marines, and Swat helicopters?  Yeah, right.  Like I wrote - story is lame.",1390953600,,202,4.2368421052631575
5356262,5,B009NNMAZI,I picked this because of the star Channing Tatum....I like him a lot.  Thought that the whole movie was well done.  Not often than my husband and I both like the same movie ...but this we did.,1390953600,,192,4.162162162162162
5356263,4,B009NNMAZI,"I enjoyed the movie for the story, I am not a big fan of all the violence.  I do like the action and the actors in the film.",1390953600,,124,3.4285714285714284
5356264,5,B009NNMAZI,"Love this movie. Definitely worth watching, and didn't have any problems streaming it over amazom .com. Well most likely watch it again in the near future.",1390953600,,155,5.0
5356265,5,B009NNMAZI,"Loved this movie, but this is the kind of movie I like.  Lots of action, but not too much gore.",1390953600,,95,3.75
5356266,3,B009NNMAZI,"Not a horrible movie but really not a good movie either. It was fun in terms of action and some of the humor was quite good. I was one of those movies that tried to seem gritty by throwing in some useless curse words but all they really did was take away from the overall fun of the movie. Without them I think this really would have been a fun romp but with them you just can't figure out what it's trying to be, a fun movie, a serious movie, whatever. I wouldn't watch it a second time for sure but don't kick myself for watching it once.",1390953600,,540,4.0092592592592595
5356267,5,B009NNMAZI,"Was an a great movie, that I had really enjoyed. The movie keep you on the end of your set to see what, how and who was behind it all and how they would survive such an ordeal. The graphics were great along with the sound. I would recommend it to another to watch on their kindle, laptop, pad, etc.",1390867200,,298,3.9833333333333334
5356268,4,B009NNMAZI,"This movie was fast paced and exciting. It's not my favorite film of all time, but still fun to watch. It's cleaner than Olympus has Fallen, so you can feel better about letting your teenagers watch it.",1390867200,,202,4.486486486486487
5356269,5,B009NNMAZI,HIGHLY recommend this movie.  It was the best I have seen and it was great and I will rent it again,1390867200,,99,3.7142857142857144
5356270,4,B009NNMAZI,"Rather unrealistic of course, but has lots of action.  It's worth watching if you can get past the corny elements.",1390867200,,114,4.7
5356271,5,B009NNMAZI,"I enjoyed watching this movie.  It held my attention and was believable, in a far-fetched sort of way. Not much character development, but that was not the purpose of the film.",1390867200,,176,4.67741935483871
5356272,5,B009NNMAZI,"Great action, lots of laughs. Perfect family movie if you have a few pre-teens, young teenagers in the house. Highly recommend.",1390867200,,127,5.095238095238095
5356273,1,B009NNMAZI,"Bad acting, weak plot, and huge liberal bias throughout. Save your money. Don't support this trash. Find another movie to watch.",1390867200,12,128,5.142857142857143
5356274,5,B009NNMAZI,I love the movie.  Saw it in the Theater. Could watch it over and over.  I would recommend it to others.,1390867200,,104,3.9047619047619047
5356285,2,B009NNMAZI,The movie was lagging in and out of hd resolution. I think the movi was good I just wasn't happy with the speed and hd qaulity,1390867200,,126,3.8846153846153846
5356286,4,B009NNMAZI,I like a movie that is suspenseful with a lot of action. If I feel like I was involved in the action by the end of the movie I'll give it a good rating,1390780800,,151,3.4705882352941178
5356287,4,B009NNMAZI,"Hubby really liked this, I could take it or leave it. Perhaps because I am not into the extreme violence. I averaged our ratings and gave it 4 stars.",1390780800,,149,4.172413793103448
5356288,5,B009NNMAZI,This was a good movie.  Both handsome actors with lots of action.  Of course of lot of the action was unrealistic but so is most Hollywood movies.  None the less it was a good movie for a good price.,1390780800,,199,4.051282051282051
5356289,1,B009NNMAZI,"Go with Olympus has fallen instead. OK action flick but really unbelievable. Make the white house look like a poorly gaurded birthday party,",1390780800,3,140,5.130434782608695
5356290,5,B009NNMAZI,"I enjoyed the movie for its action, and it continued to hold you attention til the end.
Also a great story with a great ending.
I watched at the theater and purchased the DVD to continue to enjoy.",1390694400,,196,4.184210526315789
5356291,5,B009NNMAZI,I thought the movie was good. It keeps on moving. It is a good action movie.  I would recommend watching it.,1390694400,,108,4.142857142857143
5356292,2,B009NNMAZI,Terrible movie. Acting is 2nd. rate. Story line is a duplicate of another movie. Do not waste your money or time.,1390608000,,113,4.428571428571429
5356293,5,B009NNMAZI,"Great story line, action packed movie with enough suspense to keep you interested and wanting more.  One of my favorite movies of 2013.  Love Jamie Foxx as president!",1390608000,,166,4.892857142857143

5356308,5,B009NNMAZI,The role of Emily Cale and John Cale ( Channing Tatum) made this one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed watching John Cale doing his job; saving the president but also making sure his daughter was safe. In addition there was some comedy in the movie. Like when Jamie Foxx dropped the rocket launcher. It is realistic that the White House could go down. It is very hard to prepare for a breach in the White House caused by the leaders of the United States. Thus the story was very intriguing. All around it was a great movie.,1390435200,,522,4.336734693877551
5356309,5,B009NNMAZI,"We really liked the movie.  Good plot and good acting.  Lots and lots of action.  Kept our interest the entire time.

5356312,4,B009NNMAZI,"This was an action packed film. We enjoyed it; especially the little girl who played Channing Tatum's daughter. The one liners were tastefully done and caused many chuckles during some fairly intense scenes. Although very unrealistic is was nice to sit down to a movie that was fun to watch along with a good story line,",1390348800,,320,4.732142857142857
5356313,2,B009NNMAZI,"I give this movie two stars instead of one because it is so ridiculous that it could transcend itself as kind of a cult dumb movie. It's sort of like the Airport-type spoofs, without trying to be. Oylpmpus Has Fallen, the other attack-the-White-House movie released this year is a tour de force by comparison.",1390348800,2,309,4.7407407407407405

5356327,5,B009NNMAZI,it was slow to start but quickly turned into a fast paced action film.  the type that only Bruce Willis could make in fact was reminiscent of his films.  it was worth the rental fee for sure and I highly recommend for those that like action films.  acting was well done.  some things took a little imagination but overall a fine film.,1390348800,,334,4.338709677419355
5356328,4,B009NNMAZI,"Quite pleased with the plot and the action. Some scenes were overly exaggerated, but it added to our enjoyment of the film. The acting was mediocre, but Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx made it work.",1390348800,,196,4.628571428571429

5356333,3,B009NNMAZI,"Not the best but it was at least entertaining.... better than the other White House movie at least. Still the acting lacked something. It may be that I am more accustomed to foreign movies, many of them Korean where the acting is more subtle and the dialogue more believable.... actually the storyline and the action seemed warmed over and there wasn't even one line that I didn't hear coming....before it was uttered out of a character's mouth.",1390262400,,445,4.792207792207792

5356346,3,B009NNMAZI,"Would have given between 3 and 4 stars, solid movie, just have a hard time with the Hollywood political overtones. Good acting, Tatum is establishing himself and Woods is always good. The daughter did a nice job.",1390262400,,212,4.756756756756757

5356351,3,B009NNMAZI,We really enjoyed the movie. A little corny in some parts and the story line and a lot if the scenes would never have a dream of being a reality but that actually added to the enjoyment. There's tons of action. Several places we laughed out  loud and a great cast. Fun movie!,1390176000,,275,4.188679245283019

5356354,2,B009NNMAZI,"I was disappointed in this movie. Considering the quality of actors involved, this movie came across as a second rate under acted disappointment.

It was ""realistic"" without being stupid and ""sensational"" enough without going over the top.  Really, the last scene of the movie was the only scene that needed to go.

It had some funny parts such as the president sticking out of the truck window with a rocket launcher and feel good parts (young girl waving presidential flag).
However, the ending was predictable.  Tourist saves the day and discovers the involvement of insiders",1389571200,,426,4.743243243243243

5356476,2,B009NNMAZI,This movie had great potential and great stars.  The people who made it were much more interested in the bad language and the action than they were in developing any type of script.  I would not recommend it.,1389484800,,208,4.447368421052632

5356478,1,B009NNMAZI,This is one of the most ridiculous movies I ever saw and if I had not spent the money on it I would have shut it of long before I even got half way through. This is Hollywood at its worst. Channing should go back to acting school.,1389484800,2,230,3.8125

5356518,1,B009NNMAZI,"If I have typos or illogic in my review, it's because I just dropped 40 IQ points.  Oh, and this is a personal opinion.  If you don't like it, ignore it.  Alternatively, and perhaps more suitable, you should go watch this piece of crap vehicle for Obama-driven political self-aggrandizement again.

First, the political issue.  White House Down plays like a Die Hard re-make, written by Chris Matthews, with Obama staff for technical advisors, produced by MSNBC, directed by Keith Olbermann, and funded by CAIR.  The overt loathing for the US military makes me sick, spouted by a director, producers, and actors - AKA liberal, left-wing scum - who spend all their time and efforts spitting on our military when they never had the balls to enlist.  The worst part is I actually LIKED several of these actors.  James Woods, what in the HELL were you thinking?

Now, the plot.  All politics aside, this is the least-plausible piece of crap ever put on celluloid...and hell, they don't even put them on celluloid anymore!  What's worse, they took Die Hard (a terrific action movie) broke down the action scene-by-scene, and stuck it in the White House.

The bad guys, easily identified by some vague facial recognition program, can pass White House security no problem.  All you need are some Audio Installation vans, a couple blue coveralls, and some wires.  Billy Jean Kings Bug Busters searching for Reticularius Mariocuomos was a much better disguise.  Once the fit starts hitting the shan (you figure it out), and the White House is put on lock down, you can knock on a door and the people inside the secured rooms will pop open that door without so much as a ""Who's there"".  I actually fear for the safety of Obama and his family because the Secret Service, Marines, and various other security personnel are so incompetent a 12 year old with an air pistol can get the drop on them.

Speaking of 12 year olds, a completely obnoxious, know-it-all child is capable of wandering around the White House and hiding from crack ex-special forces soldiers long enough to get video of ALL of the terrorists and upload it to her YouTube channel.  Who points out the video so it goes viral?  Who knows, and who cares, right Roland?  Just so long as daddy knows she didn't get out and the terrorists can pinpoint their pet hostage, why bother with annoying details?

Something else that bothers me.  The first flag at hand in the White House is not the American flag, but the Presidential seal.  I literally got a chill seeing that.

The holes in the plot were big enough to drive a tank through, and that's even BEFORE it's blown up with an RPG.  At least in Die Hard it was called ""The Car,"" a significantly smaller, light APC hit from less than 30 stories with multiple RPGs, as opposed to a fully-armored M1 Abrams hit with an RPG from 1/4 mile away.  An RPG-29 could possibly do it, but that ain't what they were using.

Oh, speaking of RPGs...evidently, the ""arsenal"" in the President's vehicle includes an RPG and...an RPG.  And not just any RPG (Am I saying RPG too much?  Im just trying to stick with the leitmotif of the movie), but a super shiny, tricked out RPG with a chrome-plated projectile.  SERIOUSLY?  What about a couple Glocks?  Or a mini-Uzi?  If I'm the President, I'd rather have access to a couple spray-n-prays than a single rocket!

All the time the President is being chased, and after the tank is taken out, where in the hell are the reinforcements?  The terrorists have a group of 5 men who can jump on an M107 .50 cal sniper and take out moving targets, but the US Army and Reserve doesn't have a single sniper who can return fire?  Wouldn't snipers be deployed to take out the men on the roof of the White House BEFORE they send in the Delta Force?  The most incompetent Delta Force the US military has ever produced, I might add.  The Delta Force action against the White House was like a modern-day Marx Brothers caricature of the military action in Duck Soup.  My next favorite scene?  The three fully-loaded Blackhawks zooming down I Street at a 10 foot deck and none of the people directly below dive for cover or get their ear drums blown out.

Channing Tatum saves the day.  Enough said.

Typically, I love movie themes and soundtracks and frequently search out songs I've heard in a movie.  If someone was holding a gun to my head, I couldn't tell you a single song that was playing or identify a theme from WHD.  I'm sure I heard something during the lame fight scenes, but I was so distracted by the implausibility of the setting and action, the horrible script, the lousy plot, and overt political message that it was impossible to relax, enjoy the ride, and absorb the sensory overload that the best action movies provide.

A complete waste of two hours I could have spent watching Alien again.",1389312000,25,4826,4.624705882352941

When we rented this from Amazon, we expected no different. The internet was slow going, and it stopped to buffer so many times. But it wasn't anything we blamed on Amazon, or anything.

You can imagine my surprise when Amazon emailed me a couple days later and told me they noticed that my video quality was pretty sub-par, so they refunded me the $3.99 we paid to rent it, because our experience wasn't quite what it should have been. Can you believe it? It wasn't even their fault, and how did they even know?

Long story short: I'll only be renting from Amazon from here on out, because I am so impressed that they care so much about your video quality.

They weren't even to blame, and they took full responsibility for it! That is incredible customer service that you just don't see anymore.",1389139200,,1057,4.576719576719577
5356557,3,B009NNMAZI,May not watch too many times. Should have spent them money on another movie that I would watch more. Guess I don't like Jamie Fox that much!,1389139200,,140,4.222222222222222
5356558,5,B009NNMAZI,"Both great movies. Will watch them more than once, that is for sure. Action movies always seem to show you something missed from the last time watched.",1389139200,,151,4.62962962962963
5356559,3,B009NNMAZI,Needed more action.  Too much starting and stopping.  Olympus has Fallen was much better to watch although it was more violent.,1389139200,,127,5.0
5356560,5,B009NNMAZI,"I must admit, that I didn't watch the movie to completion....fell asleep but son said it was a good movie",1389139200,,105,4.3
5356561,5,B009NNMAZI,One of the best action films I have seen in awhile.  It arrived on time and worked perfectly.  I would suggest it to anyone that likes action films.,1389052800,,148,4.25
5356562,5,B009NNMAZI,"A ton of great explosions and gunfire! Channing Tatum's character was great, loveable and you keep rooting him on throughout the whole film. Jamie Foxx as always is funny and added a fun new perspective that I wouldn't expect from a president. I would absolutely suggest this as a buy or rent!",1389052800,,293,4.653846153846154
5356563,2,B009NNMAZI,"I got it...it is a bit of a stretch - the whole concept of taking down the White House (at least I hope so).  But, this had so many inconceivable and plain silly twists and turns that I actually found myself laughing by the end.  Save yourself the money and rent something else.",1389052800,,278,4.226415094339623
5356574,3,B009NNMAZI,i thought this was going to be wasted time and money but it was entertaining and had some really good effects in it but not so much so that would make it tedious. whereas Foxx is on his downside (in my opinion) of his career Tatum is on a major rise and they both meet up well in this movie.,1389052800,,291,3.8666666666666667
5356575,5,B009NNMAZI,Great movie and has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Great production and acting. But I wish more movies could be produced without graphic language. I think it could still bring the punch of the message without all the F and H words.,1389052800,,245,4.23404255319149
5356576,5,B009NNMAZI,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Much like Olympus Has Fallen but not quite as much killing and blood.  I felt the characters were very likeable.,1389052800,,146,4.8
5356577,4,B009NNMAZI,"Thought the beginning of this movie is slow going but it gets much better in the second half with much more action!!  Enjoyed Channing Tatum, even with most of his clothes on!!!  LOL!!!",1389052800,,185,4.575757575757576

5356580,5,B009NNMAZI,"Even though some scenes were unrealistic, the overall movie was very entertaining and suspenseful. All lead actors did a good job. Strange the movie never mentioned the death of Channing Tatum's ""girlfriend?""",1389052800,,208,5.53125
5356581,5,B009NNMAZI,I love Jamie Fox and Channing Tatum.  Seen most everything they have both made.  You can tell that I am a movie fan!,1388966400,,116,4.0
5356582,3,B009NNMAZI,"I really liked the star in the movie who was doing all the action and shooting up the bad guys.
As far as the person who played the president I found him not believable at all. Some great action in this movie but some was over the top. I can see where some may really like this movie.",1388966400,,284,3.913793103448276
5356583,1,B009NNMAZI,"Where do I start? ...Just do yourself the favour and don't watch this movie! Foxx has done some of the worst acting ever and Tatum has still yet to be in a movie where I can actually look at him as a serious actor. The action in this movie was ridiculous and unrealistic, the acting was horrid, there were too many stupid one lines and cliches (like the black man has to put on Nike's to run), oh and did I mention this came out the same time Olympus has Fallen did??
Ugh gouge my eyes out with rusty spoon please!",1388966400,3,514,4.099009900990099

5356596,3,B009NNMAZI,"but probably not the best action flick I've seen. I thought the chemistry between Tatum & Foxx was good but for some reason, it just didn't knock my socks off.",1388966400,,159,4.333333333333333
5356597,2,B009NNMAZI,"Poorly written. Goofy at times. Lots of action but no substance. This ends so stupidly I went ""Come On, Man!""
Wouldn't watch it again or recommend it. Don't waste your time.",1388966400,,173,4.612903225806452

5356599,5,B009NNMAZI,I ENJOYED THIS ITEM VERY MUCH AS I ENJOYED BOTH STARS IN THE MOVIE.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  BOTH ACTORS ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTICE.,1388966400,,154,4.464285714285714
5356600,5,B009NNMAZI,We like the action pack with humor sense in this movie. Although not seem realistic it makes us jump into our seats.,1388966400,,116,4.318181818181818
5356601,5,B009NNMAZI,Excellent....Thrilling great action packed movie.  My heart was racing through most of it.  If you like action this is a good one.,1388966400,,130,4.863636363636363
5356602,4,B009NNMAZI,"Entertaining movie - worth renting as DVD.  Do not recommend buying.  Tatum and Foxx both great.  A bit unbelievable, reminds me of the Die Hard movies.",1388880000,,152,4.769230769230769
5356603,5,B009NNMAZI,we do not attend theaters. found it and watched at home. it was great. both husband and I enjoyed the movie.,1388880000,,108,4.190476190476191

5356615,5,B009NNMAZI,"It is dramatic, intriguing, and has just the right amount of humor. The language would not be considered family friendly, but situationally appropriate.",1388880000,,152,5.6521739130434785
5356616,3,B009NNMAZI,Although there was lots of action the plot was a little thin and totally unbelievable.  I like that it was fast moving which is about it.,1388880000,,137,4.269230769230769
5356617,2,B009NNMAZI,"Talk about a rip... these actors couldn't fight their way out of a Kindergarten nursery, and that's being kind to the nursery. So many faults with the flick that to list would require more patience and time than is possible to commit to the tale. Go with the Martin Freeman version of a White House attack and enjoy better acting, far better storyline without the continuity problems, and better cinematography.",1388880000,,411,4.885714285714286
5356618,1,B009NNMAZI,"I cringed throughout this movie. Lines were cheesy, acting was subpar. I was generally disappointed across the board. Best scenes were the helicopters flying thru the city, and some good explosions. But not worth 2 hours of time. Was disappointed, it could have been good.",1388880000,,272,5.066666666666666
5356619,4,B009NNMAZI,Time well spent! Lots of action and enough humor to remind you that the extreme situations were not to be taken serious.  Recommend to everyone.,1388880000,,144,4.76
5356620,2,B009NNMAZI,"Enjoyed the story up until it seemed they were doing special effects just to keep the action going, and they did not blend well and looked green-screeny.",1388880000,,153,4.703703703703703
5356621,5,B009NNMAZI,I loved this movie. Can't wait for my husband to see it. Great action movie. I would and have told my friends about it. Would watch again.,1388880000,,138,4.148148148148148
5356622,4,B009NNMAZI,better than expected movie.  REnted it a few nights ago and watched it twice in the allowed 24 hrs.  enjoyed the action/comedy.,1388880000,,127,4.7272727272727275
5356623,5,B009NNMAZI,To think that our country and White House is this vulnerable is a little scarry but honestly the film is just not very believable.  However my husband and I found the movie to be really entertaining and just provided a night of movie escape!!  I recommend to all who are able to accept it as entertainment.,1388880000,,306,4.446428571428571
5356634,1,B009NNMAZI,"Not only shabbily made but morally bankrupt.  Real trash, nadir of American film making.  Comparable to Behind Enemy Lines, Zero Dark Thirty and World War Z.  Death Porn, like so much coming out of Hollywood.",1388880000,2,208,4.885714285714286
5356635,3,B009NNMAZI,"If not for Channing and Jaime Foxx, this movie would have gotten 1 to 2 stars. With all due respect to Mr Emmerich, political intrigue is just not his forte. I can do the subliminal messages but this kind of action film is beyond his expertise. It's very hard to hit all the right notes, the last person who pulled that off was the genius behind Murder At 1600. Channing is great in action but he needs the right vehicle and this is just not it.",1388793600,,445,4.186046511627907
5356636,3,B009NNMAZI,This movie turns into a ridiculous remake of a diehard movie.  Starts out good but dwindles into predictable action.  I really thought I was watching a die hard movie with different characters.,1388793600,,193,5.0
5356637,2,B009NNMAZI,"I like Channing Tatum but he couldn't save this movie.  Jamie Fox has had some good movies but I don't know if it was the script or he was afraid of offending Obama but he was a horrible president. .  horrible!

The script should have been sent to the compost pile - it was hopeless.  Both actors tried to rescue it but the script was so horrible their was no rescuing it - White House blown to little smelly bits.",1388793600,,414,4.1375

5356641,3,B009NNMAZI,"It was ok, but a little hokey (not realistic.) Good for kids, but cannot compare with recent action movies of the same ilk. I am sure it is good for humor to a certain age group.",1388793600,,178,3.9722222222222223
5356642,5,B009NNMAZI,"lots of action, good guys win, both Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx were great. Would recommend it for anyone that likes a lot of action.",1388793600,,135,4.44
5356643,4,B009NNMAZI,"It starts off slow but picks up quickly.  I would give it a 4 as some of it is unrealistic with a predictable plot development.  It is amazing how the hero can get beat up and fall from great heights and get up immediately to continue the fight and not fall over at the end (in fact, be rather chipper).  However, for an action and kick the bad guys film, not bad.",1388793600,,364,4.027777777777778
5356644,4,B009NNMAZI,If you are looking for a love story or a deep mind thinking plot this is not the movie for you. it has a lot of action in the movie. Sometimes it was over the top but it kept my interest.,1388793600,,187,3.5853658536585367

See it and either agree or disagree.",1388707200,,208,4.048780487804878
5356648,1,B009NNMAZI,"I would give this 2 stars but for the people who gave it 5.  It has some good action scenes, Tatum's character wasn't bad and had some fun stuff.  But this movie is primarily a political fantasy making the Black President out to obtain world peace while the evil white republican guy and the evil defense industry trying to sabotage the president.  Hollywood has become so blatant in their attempts at stereotyping now that they don't really care anymore.  So if you want to see a better movie, see Olympus has fallen.",1388707200,2,518,4.5978260869565215

5356675,2,B009NNMAZI,"Surely, reimbursements from the movies are not based on casts, scripts and combination of professionalism any story might present.

Perhaps, it is barely grounded very much on a scandalous imagination of creators whatever delusive imaginary is to be presented.

Top rank state officials cheat and use each other to destroying a planet in order to get a hand on presidential accessories while a good guy, as usual underestimated by the HR, saved a world.

Factually, if something realistic could be traced, it is movie-makers personal attitudes toward political environment domestic.",1388707200,2,582,5.444444444444445

5356678,3,B009NNMAZI,It started off good but it went on to long. It seemed never to quit. Right when you felt it was the right place to stop something else came up. It was like s*** not more. And at the end the President was stabbed by glass and shot and he's happy when the fly off to the hospital. Just to much.,1388620800,,292,3.80327868852459

5356688,5,B009NNMAZI,"Well written, acted and choreographed cinema; this film is definately worth watching. The viewer should be aware that this film seems to offer commentary to stunningly accurate current political conditions and seems to have created personalities and visual representations of current American political cast members, such as our current president, speaker of the house, first lady, vice president, congress, and various notable pundits within the American military, to such a degree, to where the viewer could feel ""Dejavu"", but all that being said, the film is excptional and the plot is intelligent and exceptionally well scripted.",1388534400,,633,5.604166666666667
5356689,3,B009NNMAZI,"Ok, my peeve with this and other movies with smart bad guys is that they make the good guys look incompetent...except for the main characters.  Most of the movie is so unbelievable that you have to basically dumb yourself down 10 notches just to watch without making comments.

5356732,3,B009NNMAZI,"Every once in a while it seems that Hollywood gets more than one movie based on the same idea produced. Coincidence? Chances are but it always seems odd when they come out at nearly the same time. The good news happens when both movies are actually well made and enjoyable. The bad news is when the second doesn't quite match up to the first. This is the case with WHITE HOUSE DOWN, a movie that is quite enjoyable on it's own but doesn't quite compare to the earlier released OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.

WHITE HOUSE DOWN features Channing Tatum as John Cale, a D.C. policeman assigned to the protection of the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). Divorced Cale is the typical absent father who is trying to get back in his daughters good graces.  Not an easy task seeing as how she's your typical pre-teen. When he tells her he has an interview to be a Secret Service agent working at the White House her attitude changes. She's a political junkie, especially when it comes to the home of the President.

Two other main characters come in to play about this time. Jamie Foxx is President Sawyer, determined to provide peace in the Middle East. He's just announced plans to bring every single military person back from that location to do so, something that doesn't sit well with the military industrial complex. The second person of interest is Secret Service agent Walker (James Woods). It's his last few days and Walker is set to retire. But something doesn't seem quite right with him.

Cale's interview doesn't go near as well as he had planned, especially since the person in charge of hiring him is agent Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) an ex-flame of sorts from his college days. Knowing him for the goof that he was then as well as noting his penchant for not following orders (even though he's a decorated war hero), she passes. Rather than let his daughter know, he instead takes her on a tour of the White House while they're there.

It's at this time that a group of mercenaries explode a bomb at the Capitol, bringing down the famous dome. But this is just a distraction. Their real intent is to capture the White House and the President. For ransom or for some other nefarious reason? All is revealed as the film moves forward and as the traitor in the White House is revealed.

Separated from his daughter since she went to use the rest room, Cale sets out to find her before harm can come to her. Along the way he rescues the President and sets up communication with the outside. His first priority is supposed to be Sawyer and for the most part he follows this. But his daughter takes precedence when push comes to shove. Even the President agrees. A fight for the White House and control of the country follows in the building as well as outside. It isn't until late into the film that the reason for this whole take over is brought out into the open and before that happens plenty of explosions and gunfire takes place.

The good parts of the movie are the action sequences, all of which are well staged and set up. The acting is nothing outstanding but is well done. The bad parts are those that seem completely unreal. To think that removing all troops from the Middle East will result in peace is the first item on hand. The President choosing to run around the White House in Air Jordans (which leads to a joke) is another. And worst of all is the attempt to take something which should be a serious matter and trying to turn it into a buddy cop flick with lots of in jokes and offhand comments. It doesn't work.

OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN took the material seriously and not only played at your patriotic heartstrings but got you involved in the story. You wanted to get the bad guys and reclaim the country. This film tends to take the Hollywood notion that right wing fanatics want to blow up the world and that just by being nice the world will become a better place. I'd say that's a bit of a stretch of the imagination. The movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment but compared to the earlier film using the same backdrop it falls far short of being something worth watching several times. In the end it might be worth watching but maybe not owning.",1388448000,4,4171,4.500660501981506

5356743,4,B009NNMAZI,I don't watch movies for the reality - sometimes it is just nice to get lost in the action even though it was a little far fetched.  My daughter is a Channing Tatum fan so it made it easier to find an action flick that the whole family would watch.,1388361600,,248,3.96

5356766,5,B009NNMAZI,Quick delivery and packaged well. A good action movie with excellent actors/actresses playing the important roles. I like that the President in this movie truly loves America and the guy trying to become part of the secret service does everything he can to protect the President and his daughter. He and his daughter were on tour when all everything breaks loose and terrorists are in the White House. This is a movie well worth your time to watch.

Jamie Fox as the president immediately made me feel like this movie was going to be awful and well I was right.  I don't care if he won or was nominated for his role as Rayv Charles in ""Ray"",  Fox is just not a good actor.  His lines always seem forced and unless he's playing a street thug type character, I just don't find him belkievable in any of his roles. He doesn'tr have what it takes to pull off playing the POTUS.  Even in a bad movie.  The rest of the move was equally as bad.  This movie hit the theaters around the same time as another action movie where bad guys take over the white house ""Olympus has fallen"".  That was a great action movie.  Although the plot seemed far fetched,at least the acting was a tad better and the action was a whole lot better than this stinker.

5356914,1,B009NNMAZI,"This Movie is first, stupid, cliche, bad acting, uninteresting, and not very entertaining.  The only Character in this entire Movie that merits actual dramatic attention is the guy playing the role of the White House Tour Guide, he is funny.

Wow where to start?  First off they choose to portray Obama versus a Neutral and Ambiguous President as most past Movies of this nature have historically done so.

They portray Veterans as the threat to America, they portray White Veterans as White Supremacist and anyone who dislikes Obama as a White Supremacist or Racist Anti-American!  They make a Chris Kyle Portrayel, Former Murdered Navy Seal Sniper, look alike in their so-called Terrorist Matrix Photos they show during the Movie!  That in particular is very distasteful to do so to a dead man, a decorated Patriot, a man now passed from this life who has a Widow, and 2 small children, and who cannot defend himself against this insidious portrayal and association of him as a Terrorist made by this Movie!  It's Disgusting!

They attack the Freedom of the Press, where Obama look alike Jamie Foxx asks ""Remind me why I allow them to broadcast this again?"" referring to an obvious attack on anyone who doesn't agree with Obama on any minute point through their positions in the Media during their Televised Entertainment and News Programs.

This Movie demonizes old guard Secret Service Agents as though they can't be trusted, especially any who are the Fathers of Military Veterans who perished in War.  Actually this Movie is such an affront to Veterans and their Families it's just Disgusting!

This Movie blatantly  BLATANTLY!  attacks our sitting House Speaker John Boehner as a man willing to Nuke the World and betray America to usurp Obama!  It demonizes The Speaker of the House as some evil White Republican who can't be trusted, and must be evil because he is White, Republican, and simply doesn't like Obama Foreign Policy- therefore he is a Terrorist with intentions against the White House and the World!  OMGosh, give me a break!

This Movie is racist!  It basically insinuates anyone who isn't an Obama Devoted Disciple and who is or may be a White Male Christian Veteran is Evil and most likely out to harm the World, America, and of course, Obama!  It definitely implies they are not to be trusted!

My God, this movie even attacks Apple and the Music of Beethoven and anyone still using Pagers!  WTFudge is that???

The Movie is such obvious BRAIN WASHING PROPAGANDA for Obama in prelude to his usurping our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, and our Nation, that I honestly believe this is the first Propaganda Movie I have ever seen in my Life period!

Don't waste your time!  This is total Garbage and absolute shameful Propaganda!

I will forever boycott these Producers, Directors, and Actors!

Go see Olympus Fallen to see a good Action Movie about the White House!  Don't waste money, time, or further thought to this obvious piece of Propaganda and complete Garbage!

Have a Nice Day!  Cant wait till we have a New Election!",1387670400,11,3053,4.852998065764023

A stunning and amazing movie thats filled with lots of historical educational facts about the White House, woven all throughout the movie. All acting, props, wardrobe, make-up, and (Top) level CGI effects are stunning. Beautiful and shockingly crisp picturesque cinematography.  The storyline and character development between all main characters is amazing. This movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride of betrayal, manipulation, and deception. This movie is gripping, with cut throat (balls-to-wall) hardcore fights, blood and gore, gun battles, and some serious carnage. (A-list) actors Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum carried this movie well and both work very well together. Both actors demonstrate their amazing acting ability and diversification. Overall, this movie was actually a lot better than expected and the quality of this movie will surprise you. However, I do hope this is the last of any (White House) under siege movie that we will ever see again. There has been too many of them lately.  Example: Olympus has fallen.

5356969,2,B009NNMAZI,"The movie uses an excellent if bigoted actor in a horrible role in a poorly written script w/empty-headed story line.

For example, on a beautiful, sunny Summer day, the President deviates from his Helo flight plan to skim the surface of the Lincoln Memorial Reflection Pool.  The bottom of the choppers literally touch the water, pulling up for a moments inspiration then on to the business of the day.  Nary a person in view throughout the ""buzz-stunt"".  Further, Secret Service & FAA, not to mention park patrons who'd just been given a heart attack would have been furious.

This movie requires almost as much suspension of disbelief as trusting the real thing.

This film seem an obvious attempt to create a favorable impression of an ineffectual World leader w/misplaced priorities and despotic intentions/actions.  It seemed a virtual portrayal of the Obama Doctrine except w/Hollywood's ability to cast the President & ideals as saintly while critics are buffoons &, of course, the portrayal of rampant White Hate groups.

Shameful.  I gave it two stars b/c it did eventually breakdown unto an action/adventure movie.

BTW, President Lincoln acted on his duty as defined in the constitution whose authority as a directive for civilian government in the U.S. was spelled out in the Declaration of Independence when the Constitutional Congress had discernment to acknowledge our rights are unalienable ones endowed by our creator w/the rights of life, liberty & the pursuit of happiness, i.e Liberty.  The Socialist state requires individuals to seek permission for every action, the Communist state considers itself supreme, all is done for the state, the state ""provides"" all her citizens needs, i.e. tyranny.

5357050,5,B009NNMAZI,I rented this movie through the Amazon instant movie program.  I was surprised that it was a good movie especially with Channing Tatum playing the hero and Jamie Foxx as the president of the United States.  I like a lot of action which this movie had. I wouldn't mind renting it again.,1386979200,,285,4.461538461538462

5357124,2,B009NNMAZI,"Ok. Not as good as the trailer would have you primed for. Saw a very political ploy with this film. Ex vets, right wingers... Ya I get the picture. Probably why it didn't do great in theaters.",1386460800,2,192,4.216216216216216
5357125,4,B009NNMAZI,This movie was entertaining and that is what I based the rating on. If you are looking for an intellectual Academy Award Winner this is not it. If you liked the Die Hard movie you will like this.,1386460800,,195,4.157894736842105
5357126,2,B009NNMAZI,"White House Down has gotten a lot of comparisons to another action film where terrorists invade and take over the White House; Olympus Has Fallen. But the difference between the two is, one film is intense and riveting, and the other is a rehash of stale gags, cliches, non-threatening villains, and an overglut of action.

I'll give you a hint; the movie where a limo crashes into the president's pool is NOT the good one. White House Down is an utter mess. From thinly drawn characters, to terrible, cliched villains, to generic action and stupid one-liners, this is not even a guilty pleasure. This is an overdose of explosions and violence set to a terribly thin political message and a complete lack of suspense.

The villains are stereotyped, played for comedic relief (always ready with a glib one-liner and a movie reference...), and never fully explored. The heroes are ALSO stereotyped, played for comedic relief, and never fully relatable. As a non-American, I felt no remorse or sympathy for anyone in the movie, except perhaps Joey King's character (a bright spot for the film).

The cast IS rather good, however. Good, that is, if you like Channing Tatum being funny and Jamie Foxx being Jamie Foxx. Maggie Gylenhaal and Richard Jenkins are decent, but Jason Clarke has no room to act other than being an over-the-top baddie. James Woods is rather fun, though.

So in conclusion, a few of the stunts are winners and the cast's chemistry is entertaining, but this is a rote, unimaginative, overblown, typical Emmerich movie. And is that such  bad thing? 3/5 white houses down.",1386460800,2,1589,4.892193308550186

A story of corruption and take-over and revenge that takes viewers to new heights of never-ending political scandal and the fight to save not just a president, but a country.

5357149,4,B009NNMAZI,"I've seen this and Olympus Has Fallen, but personally enjoyed this more. Olympus Has Fallen is a great movie, but White House Down was more entertaining.

White House Down has lots of great action, good serious moments, and some humor. Channing and Jamie both did great. The other actors in this film also did good. There were many WOW moments in this film, which I enjoyed. If you like action movies and have a sense of humor, then definitely check this one out!",1386201600,,463,4.578313253012048

5357152,4,B009NNMAZI,"It's unfair to compare one movie to another, but when Hollywood gives us three movies about the government losing control of the White House, it's going to happen.  This is easily the best of the three.  If you are a fan of ""Die Hard"" type movies, it's nonstop action without being heavy-handed.  Check your brain at the door, of course, but it's a fun watch if you're in the mood a lighter action flick.",1386201600,3,404,4.4324324324324325

5357154,3,B009NNMAZI,I had a meh average feeling towards this movie overall. You got some rookie wanting to be the presidents body guard but they pretty much tell him oh no you not good enough to be Jamie fox's body guard(president).  The problem with this movie is ummmmm it's not realistic I want give away too much but you got scenes like when the bad guys walk into the White House and starts killing security one by one as they come running around the corner. Then you have special forces on the roof looking out at the entrance hate waiting for the bad guys to what appear out in the opening but while the 3 of them are on the roof looking str8 ahead bad guy guess what? Comes behind all 3 of them and shot them all in their backs. Like wow really?  So that's my only flow with this  movie,1386201600,,774,4.1466666666666665

5357173,2,B009NNMAZI,"At times funny and enjoyable but about 45 minutes too long.  I always enjoy Channing Tatum, but even he couldn't save this movie from the stupid plot holes, cliches, and the unbearable length of the movie.  I also get tired of the angry teen who is mad at the hero.  Can't some movies have kids who like their fathers? I realize they were going for the whole redemption thing, but it seemed tiresome and made the teenage girl instantly dislikable, even though her character turned out to be pretty good, it took me forever to warm up to her because she was such a little snot in the beginning of the movie.",1386028800,,606,4.392857142857143

Jamie Foxx did a good job as being the president, even though was more of a secondary character. Tatum did a good job as well but the real star was the actress that played Emily.

5357192,2,B009NNMAZI,"This is one of those dumb action movies that also wants to make a Statement. And the Statement is this: Our real enemy is not Al-Qaeda. It's those gun-wielding rednecks from Duck Dynasty. Or any White Republican Male with a Gun or a Grudge, or both. Or anyone who disagrees with ObamaI mean President Sawyer about removing troops from the Mid East. You might lose track of the Statement, however, once Channing Tatum gets down to his undershirt. And he somehow manages to escape being hit by people with machine guns standing ten feet away from him. But the bad guys are always such lousy shots, besides being completely stupid and insane and Republican. On the plus side, Jamie Foxx is always fun to watch, even when he has a terrible script. And Tatum is fun to watchperiod. Just don't let him talk too much. The guy needs subtitles. And he's supposed to have an 11-year old daughter? When did that happen? When he was, like, 14? James Woods does his best, trying to make sense of his character. He's a truly great actor.

Everyone running in all directions, the White House totally falling in pieces & on fire behind them, being chased by who knows who, & still, the little wise ass comments meant to be humorous - or maybe not.

Channing takes his daughter to the White House to go on a tour while he is interviewing for the secret service. She goes to a rest room and at that precise time a paramilitary group storms the White House and kills or captures everyone in site.  Channing is not captured and he is the only one in the White House to get president Jamie Foxx to safety and to also find his daughter.  The action is fast, believable and has surprises.

Jamie Foxx's lines are often stupid and not presidential which makes his character totally unbelievable as the leader of the free world. Channing Tatum is following after Bruce Willis' character John McClane in the Die Hard series as he does the impossible time after time. There were two ""White House"" movies this year along with Olympus Has Fallen and both are based on the same idea and both are not very good. Olympus in my opinion is the better of the two.

Of course the Die Hard in the White House comparisons are inevitable but that was a great, smart, economic film with characters not cartoons. Did this movie have to imitate every scene... Family in peril, helicopter shot in at the wrong guy, hero trapped in elevator shaft etc etc etc. A reminder that Foxx just cannot act though I once had hope for Channing.

The president is racing around the white house lawn being chased by a SUV firing thousands of bullets at the presidential car and not one of the thousands of armed people outside of the fence fires a shot to help the president? There was a lot of action but unfortunately it made our armed forces and all the technology look silly when some geek hacker over-rides all of the security, monitored the traffic cameras for flying helicopters and unlocked the nuclear weapons arsenal.

I was just looking for some mindless entertainment, and that is exactly what I got; in spades! I can see how many people are upset by the political propaganda exposed here, but I am basically putting that aside and focusing on the action / adventure aspects.

The plot may be a little hard to believe, and there are some logic flaws here and there, but what action movie does not have those nowadays. I am pretty used to that, so as long as I get a film that keeps me entertained, it has done its job. This one definitely did that. I was worried with it being so long, but I have to say that I had so much fun it actually fell short.

Both Tatum and Fox do a very decent job with their performances, as does James Woods. The action scenes are well made and the stage of the White House provides an exciting environment for the explosive developments. There is plenty of suspense to go around and even some comedic moments. I would say that those people that liked Die Hard and are not bothered by the left / right political aspects of the movie, should have a very good time watching this.",1384992000,,1174,4.331818181818182

5357352,5,B009NNMAZI,great movie one that was better then i thought it would be. so glad that i rented it. thank you,1384819200,,95,3.8
5357353,1,B009NNMAZI,"Ok, where to begin.  Hmmmmm.
Any kind of high end ""sniper rifles"" have to be zeroed (matched to the physical atributes of) the shooter in order to get perfect shots right off the bat.  You do not simply kill a dedicated sniper, pick up his zeroed weapon and start making perfect 800 meter shots with it.
A very old RPG 7 will most certainly not penetrate the frontal armor of an M1 Abrams tank, any generation.  By the way there, It looked like a full company of armor online in front of the WH, I heard the order given to assault, Why did only one tank move out and why did they stop when one tank was hit?  I realize hollywood is too stupid to understand but, in a frontal assault, people, or tanks, get hit.  You do not simple sit down and start crying becasue one guy is down.  The rest go on to the objective, no matter what.
The scene with the ""delta force"" helos ""attacking"" the WH?  Why did they not put their troops on the roof?  Instead they came in, and hovered beside the building.  Maybe the director should have put a big bullseye on the side, or would that have been too obvious?
The presidential limo is being chased around the lawn by armored vehicles who, BTW, are blowing more rounds than they could possibly be carrying and none of the troops surrounding the grounds opens fire on those vehicles AFTER having been ordered to do so?  For that matter, they could have just blown a gate and let the limo out.  Too simple I guess.
The most annoying thing, about this movie, was the whole, ""evil, right wing,  white guys and the military industrial complex trying to kill the peace loving super smart black president who knows best"" routine.  Really.  Makes me want to puke.  It is more like propoganda than entertainment.",1384819200,28,1737,4.418238993710692

5357357,1,B009NNMAZI,"Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx (hereafter referred to as Fauxxbama) star in Roland Emmerich's mashup of Triumph of the Will and Die Hard.

Sony lost 200 million on this bomb. Good. Isn't making a action/propaganda movie for liberals a bit like cooking a steak for a vegetarian?

The quips were not funny at all. Every. Single. Character, from Fauxxbama to the little girl was annoying as a chalkboard scratch. The movie then sets about insulting every American left.

The special effects, however, were quite excellent.

The movie ends, after the desolation of the White House, with the entire Arab world wanting to sit down and talk about peace. Why? Because the capitol building was burning and the White House was destroyed? Shoot, if that's all it takes, lets do it tomorrow!

Olympus has Fallen was a weak movie, but still far better than this insulting piece of trash. It makes me wonder if the funding Roland Emmerich got for this movie was from Iran. Seriously.",1384819200,10,968,4.842424242424243

5357370,1,B009NNMAZI,"I saw Olympus Has Fallen and as I sat there watching the movie I had chills running down my spine and up my arms because of the destruction. It was amazing as a veteran to see the resolve in the heroes of that movie. However (dot dot dot), there is an imposter about. White House Down. I will be honest, I have not seen the movie. i will be honest again. I will never see the movie. I saw the trailers for this movie and they made me mad. That scene where Jaime Fox loses the bazooka and Tatum is like what, how do you lose a bazoka? Why add humor in a movie like this? Its called White House Down. I assume that the white house and innocent Americans inside and out... go down. Then I found out that the bad guys are right wing politicians. Can another movie seriously be more politicized? An African American President fighting to survive against the evil masterminds that are the Republicans? Sound familiar? To be fair if it was the opposite way around, I would still be just as mad. That's why I love OHF so much. It just doesn't go there. I don't even think you actually know which party the president of OHF actually represents. Please, save your money and instead go see Olympus Has Fallen. I promise you when that secret service agent is fighting for his life and whispers, ""Olympus has fallen"", you will get that feeling. And we all know that feeling. That feeling that we are about to get served something fun and special.",1384732800,3,1433,4.350746268656716
5357371,5,B009NNMAZI,"OK, I enjoy action movies to a degree, but those without a plot, or action for the sake of action, just annoy me.  I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but was quite pleasantly surprised to enjoy it from start to finish.  The film was well-acted throughout, with honest, emotive relationships among the characters, AND was filled with action and special effects.  Is White House Down plausible in reality?  I think not... but action films are developed to entertain, not to tell a cautionary tale.  Does the tale offer a political message?  Perhaps, but that's up to the viewer to evaluate.

I found the film and its characters entertaining, well-acted and enjoyable.  It's well worth the investment of an evening's entertainment.",1384732800,4,737,4.983606557377049
5357372,4,B009NNMAZI,Like others have said this is a modern day Die Hard.  A very good movie that entertained me.  I usually don't get hung up in the details or plot holes but there is one thing about this movie that really bothered me.  It was the ending!  How can you trace the number of someone that beeped you?  I guess kids today don't understand how beepers work.  You dial the beeper number and then dial the number you want them to see on the beeper screen.  There is no way to take the beeper and see who called the beeper number.  The ending of the movie let me cold but I really enjoyed the movie up until that point.  I still think this movie was worth watching and give it 4 stars (which is a lot for me).,1384732800,,697,4.029197080291971

5357376,2,B009NNMAZI,"Actually I would give it 1 1/2 stars if I could.

Story line is not remotely plausible at all (No kidding), having a bunch of right wing nuts at the very top of our government, with some more right wingers added in to almost cause a third world war just because of a son being killed in action, defense contracts coming to an end, and the Speaker of the House wanted to go after Iran, is just plain dumb, silly story line, and this movie just went down the tubes right from the start.  Mentioning start, we have a Secret Service Wannabe, who was not qualified to apply, but the writers wanted this in a well to make him the hero. Jamie Farr was not a plausible President either.  Than we have a little girl that does not call her Dad father in the movie (Because Mom and Dad are divorced) until close to the end, and I have seen this before in another movie.  Wish they would stop doing this.

Anyway, it was not to my liking, but I paid for it....Dearly",1384646400,,954,4.191256830601093

5357404,1,B009NNMAZI,"Actually watched when first released with mostly glowing ratings. I realize factors other than the movie itself can influence the viewing enjoyment. Since INDEPENDANT DAY is one of my all-time favs. I decided to wait and watch again. It was as horrific the second time. Of course I never expected the story to be realistic. But, it's the character's response to basically every single event which makes this movie nothing other than silly and utterly stupid. Since there are so many scenes from which I can chose, I will limit it to a couple. Apparently, Channing Tatum is ""faster than a speeding bullet"" saving the president's son while running/shielding him against several terrorist shooting automatic weapons point blank in a single room. Bruce Willis may have pulled off similar feats, but he at least suffered a wound or two. This is my all-time worst movie scene of any movie.  Two cabinet members & the president each know one of  three codes for releasing nukes. Most know this is the terrorist's demand.  The female (forgive me if I have her title wrong) sec. of defense is kicking, screaming and fighting ""torture"" to the brink of death as the president gives the okey-dokey  to negotiate w/ terrorists. Her first statement after certain death is ""how's my hair?"" Come on! I have never degraded another viewer's review. I just can't understand why anyone would give this 5 stars unless they're a teenage boy. I'm not insulting anyone who loved this movie. I just can't understand. I'm sure many hated various movies I loved. This movie certainly was not for me. And, I honestly tried twice to enjoy.",1384560000,,1610,4.864963503649635

There were good guys - I don't want to know their whole life history - just shoot the bad guys (whom I also don't need to know their life histories either). If I had any real complaint it would be shooting down Air Force One with an ICBM - but at least the effects were good for that scene and they didn't take 5 minutes to mourn those lost in the crash!

Channing and Jamie had good chemistry and seemed like well developed characters, but two out of 30 or so named characters isn't enough when the rest are one dimensional and outdated stereotypes at best (and eyebrow-less James Woods at worst).

5357421,2,B009NNMAZI,"It was ok. Pretty heavy handed in some parts, kinda dumb in parts, kinda fun in parts. Just about what you would expect from something like this. Low commitment; no intellect required. Relied heavily on special effects to keep the audience engaged.

I think this is about $1 worth of entertainment, $2 tops. Wait until it's cheaper, and you will feel like you got a decent deal. If you are offended by over-the-top political activism/opinions disguised as action movies, I would advise against watching this.

Also, would somebody please tell the directors of these films to stop having the characters jack a shell into the chamber of their gun every time they want to make a point or punchline?

Strong quality production design, solid direction and a enjoyable yarn once you get over a contrived plot.  James Woods walks through his role as the bad guy and the reason for the takeover never rings even remotely true.  Tatum and Foxx are enjoyable outshining some stunted dialogue while it is hands down the greatest White House set ever created for film.

And just for kicks, how does a rocket propelled grenade destroy an M1A2 Abrams tank by hitting it in its toughest spot, the front?  A:  It would not.  Another inaccuracy:  the windows on the presidential limo do not roll down!  This was just another poor redux of Die Hard, and a spectacularly bad one at that!

Nothing new here at all, and that's what disappointed me.  Was hoping for something other than a generic quip-filled movie and didn't get it.

A surprising amount of talking is involved, and our heroes spend a considerable portion of the film hiding atop an elevator, chatting, where they go unnoticed by bad guys who've apparently never seen Die Hard or a dozen other movies where the good guys use elevators and air shafts to creep around. It never really gets fun and the special effects are a little weak, not the sort of thing I expect from Roland Emmerich. The villains are right wing ex-soldiers, disillusioned Secret Service agents, and ambitious politicians, as opposed to ""Olympus Has Fallen"", where the villains are Korean terrorists, disillusioned Secret Service agents, and ambitious politicians. As usual, you can spot the chief villain of ""White House Down"" right out of the gate. I won't say who or how, but you can check off the usual boxes, including most innocuous and seemingly nicest person. If you are surprised by the revelation of this person as the villain at the end, I think you aren't watching enough movies. Avoid this and watch ""Olympus Has Fallen"", which at least has the good grace to earn it's R rating with non-stop action and a gritty, ruthless hero.",1384214400,,1281,4.907834101382488

this movie and Olympus has fallen will be played over and over

the actual taking down of the white house or twin towers or whatever other national icon
becomes a movie scenario on cable news.

The most unbelievable part: The aircraft - that type aircraft would've shown up on radar 100 miles out to sea. How did it get so close to land - nay - it was almost to Virginia before interceptors were scrambled.

I gave this review one * only because I had to put in something in order to write the review, other than that it would have gotten ZIP nothing. I sat through watching Olympus has fallen only because it was free. I watched the trailer on this movie, and I don't think I'd watch it even if it was free.

I think we have come to a point in this nation where there needs to be a law against degrading our military, Secret Service, the presidency and any other organization that is structured for the security and the defense of this nation done in the name of action and adventure movies of any kind. I believe this falls under the heading of Homeland Security.

We know that there are many rogue nations, terrorist and other idiots who would be enticed to really think that this nation is so poorly defended and thinks so little of itself that it shows us as being so stupid in the name of humor over a few bucks for the writers. And don't blame them if they feel like we're worth taking a shot at given what they see in our movies.

This is a shame and a disgrace to see all that we hold dear misused, and serious actors made to look like bungling jokes that know the truth but will do anything for a few bucks more, even damaged their reputation and integrity.

But you feel so damn good after a day of suspended belief that it makes the $100 entrance fee worth it.  I splurged and got the $5.99 HD rental of White House Down because, well, its a Roland Emmerich film and I expected expertly crafted visuals upon which a Spielbergian child hero would help save the day because gosh darn it, in Rolands world kids are important.  And the kid inside us is important to us too.  Thats why in 2012 we got to see giraffes and elephants hauled to the arks in the middle of the night be awesome Black Hawk helicopters cuz ya know what?  In Rolands world Black Hawk helicopter are the preferred method of moving your inner child from place A to B.
So what Im trying to say is that this movie is perfectly awful in terms of plausibility or logical continuity but ya know what?  In Roland Emmerichs world belief is meant to be suspended in order to enjoy the journey.  If you think about the destination the magic is ruined and it becomes a stinker of a movie.  But in Roland Emmerichs fantastic universe a sense of humor is just another dimension of the ambience.  And in Roland Emmerichss world Tatum Channing has to end up with his shirt off sweaty and smudged by the orgy of exploding  cars, national monuments, bad guys and have I mentioned, Black Hawk helicopters?
This movie sucked in terms that a movie critic would understand but my inner child loved it.  There was the right balance of stuff blowing up, emotions being tugged and sprays of bullets that somehow always miss the hero.  You just cant fire that much weaponry at one human and not have something hit him.  Except in Roland Emmerichs world where the hero, by golly, actually is invincible against all odds.

It is the military/industrial complex that is causing all wars to make money(haven't heard that one for a while.)  The terrorist are not Muslims but unhappy former military, Secret Service, and (of course) white supremacists who hate the president (probably NRA members all).
Finally the Speaker of the House is an old white guy (conservative)who cooked it all up to become president. It's no accident it sounds familiar and you will see all the real life counterparts in it, as Hollywood wants you to.

They and their weapons get into the White House without a problem, take down everyone, hold hostages, and the entire American military do nothing but stand outside the White House and watch. It's unclear exactly what these invaders want, but they're killing a lot of people, making an enormous amount of noise and doing a lot of damage. They supposedly want to capture the President alive, but keep shooting at him with big guns. The computer geek hacks into a presidential computer, which supposedly gives access to every rocket launcher under U.S. command. This has been compared to Die Hard by other reviewers, but I loved that movie and this ain't that. The humor is missing, as well as the suspense and excitement. This reads more like a badly written political statement. I'm a Democrat and I found this idiocy embarrassing. Any resemblance to living politicians is obviously intentional. The President is our Ghandi, so guess who the bad guys are? *spoiler alert* By the end of the movie it's still unclear why they needed the president alive, and Iran agrees to a peace treaty since the U.S. asked so nicely.",1384041600,,1475,4.765625

America desperately needs new action stars but I fear we are too pansified to produce one.

I thought the movie was suppose to be a action film but I think spoof movie was more what it turned out to be. The Rush Limbaugh character, the President attempting to be Obama, the obligatory right wing white extremists.

This movie has plenty of action and will keep you entertained all the way through. The problem is that we have seen this before (ala Die Hard or Olympus has Fallen) and there is nothing new added here or any big surprises. In fact, it is a very predictable if not unrealistic story that strays into being a bit too long, time wise. In fact, this movie is very similar in a lot of ways to the Olympus movie except maybe with a bigger budget.

The effects and scenery are good and Tatum does a decent job in the role although I personally miss John Mccain from Die hard. The problem is not the acting per say but the script with its terrible one liners that make me wanna smack my forehead. The movie brings almost every type of bad guy into the fold for good measure as well, which just makes the storyline a bit more silly and improbable.

The plot is ludicrous, the acting uneven (over-indexing on the really poor), the screenplay borders on (and often crosses over into) the comical, and you'll have to work your tail off suspending disbelief. And it's over all too quickly.

The White House is under attack by terrorists and a would-be Secret Service agent, on a tour with his daughter is the president's only hope. With that wee bit of information, I'm sure you could write the entire plot and easily predict the ending. By-and all throughout--act 3, my daughter and I were shaking our heads and laughing out loud -- yet we couldn't look away. The capital building blows up. NORAD is hacked. The president is kidnapped. The launch codes for the country's nuclear arsenal are compromised. A young girl is threatened. A father risks all to save her. The terrorists are exposed--on YouTube. You'll also get a steady stream of poorly articulated and not-so-subtle liberal politics along with healthy dabs of political correctness (probably to balance all the violence and the presence of the white male hero) and tiny National Treasure-like educational gems. The film even sports a psychotic computer geek who likes classical music and lollipops (no, I'm not kidding). It's all here woven together in an over-the-top, grammatically-challenged, incoherent mess.

And its the mess that makes the movie eminently watchable. It's so bad, so mind-numbingly ridiculous, it serves up a great night of entertainment. Just don't tell anyone.",1383955200,,1591,5.186770428015564
5357576,1,B009NNMAZI,"Let's not even bother to make comparisons between ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""White House Down"", even though their obviously similar story lines make it difficult to do so. ""Olympus"" was silly, but in a serious way. ""White House Down"" is just plain silly.

So, turning our focus to ""White House""...

First, the so-called ""security"" shown in this film is laughably inaccurate. There are long stretches featuring bad mercenary guys (or rather, cardboard cutout bad mercenary guys - ""BMGs"" hereinafter)wandering, at will, through a deserted White House, chasing down the President and assorted cardboard cutout good guys. Not possible. If the White House crashes, and goes into lockdown, there is NO free access to discrete parts of the building. People, good or bad, cannot wander around at will. A further example involves the BMGs accessing the rooftop defensive measures command/control center: guess what? They just take a ride up to the roof in an elevator that contains no security measures - not even a Key Card reader. The fact that all this occurs when the building is in full lockdown simply takes the unbelievable and makes it laughable.

And yet... other elevators in the building are fully modernized and electronic. The old clunker that gets taken to the rooftop, rattles and creaks, and threatens to give out under too much weight. I suspect that this old thing, perhaps a gift from Elisha Otis himself, would have been junked by Harry Truman when he tore the White House apart in 1948 - yet there it is, as a lame, predictable plot device. Ouch.

The crew of BMGs that gets into the White House on the thinnest of pretexts, ostensibly to install equipment in the Residence, simply would not pass the obsessively thorough security checks, particularly since their real identities, once the crisis is underway, are easily obtained with a few strokes of a keyboard and some vaguely defined facial-recognition software. If they're that easily identified as questionable types, they wouldn't get past the street entrances. And... firearms inside the White House? Let's be charitable and call that detail ""doubtful"". Besides... the White House already has a private theater in the East Wing.

OK, then. Let's just overlook those pesky details. Let's forget, for a moment, that ""details"" are where the devil sets up residence. If security were portrayed with any degree of accuracy, the lame plot would collapse from lack of credibility. Let's go ahead, then, and suspend disbelief for a moment: The plot elements used to justify the attack on the President and the White House are extremely thin, and never explained. There's some fuss about the son of the White House Secret Service AIC and an illness affecting the man's judgment. I hate to harp on this, but if the senior Secret Service Agent in the White House were diagnosed with terminal cancer, the President and senior staff would be aware of it before the man left his doctor's office. In the film, they're not. The evil things visited upon the son are referred to several times, but never clarified.

One of the larger problems is the casting of Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer. He's simply not believable: he's not, for lack of a better word, ""presidential"". A scene where he chooses to wear a pair of high end kicks to get around the besieged residence is, bluntly, ridiculous. However, Foxx's casting is perhaps no more ludicrous than James Woods in the role of the angry, cancer-ridden Secret Service Chief. It's a shame to see an actor of Woods' calibre reduced to this kind of role. I think I preferred him in ""My Name is Bill W.""... as awful as that was.

And then, of course, there's Channing Tatum, the ""hunk du jour"" who appears to have been cast simply in order to have his name on the project. It certainly wasn't for his acting skills. Perhaps it helped with the financing. Of course, the impossible plot elements that lead to his being at the White House when the attack begins don't help. In fact, they strain credulity to the breaking point: right... a loose cannon Capitol Policeman, with a GED and a few college courses is called to the White House for an interview for a job on the President's Secret Service Security detail. That's exactly how they do it.

I could go on for some time loading up on the film's idiotic omissions and inconsistencies... but why bother. This thing ain't worth the trouble, ain't worth the rental fee, ain't worth the energy required to operate the remote control to turn it off.

This dog appears to have been written by a committee of screenwriters. Unfortunately, it also appears that they never talked to each other until the day they all had to sit down and hand in their assignments. The only consistency throughout is... the utter lack of consistency, coupled with non-existent believability. The simple fact that so many details rang false meant I was constantly saying to myself, ""that couldn't happen..."". Once that pattern develops, any chance of relaxing and enjoying the film as a vacant action thriller disappears.

Maybe, if you're 14 years old and don't know any better, it might be a fun two hours. But guys, watch out. Even the bang bang shoot shoot stuff is pretty soft-core. There's hardly any blood, and definitely, no boobage.",1383868800,10,5262,4.882418812989922

The second problem is this movie wants badly to be Die Hard but doesn't do a very good job.  Our main character John, has a rocky family life and gets caught in a building with terrorists trying to stop them.  It's like someone made a spreadsheet with all the things that they thought made Die Hard great and tried to copy it.

From the huge chunk of the movie dealing with the President who achieves peace in the Middle East and the evil businessmen afraid of losing government contracts to uninspired by-the-numbers action it's no surprise this movie did so poorly.

5357595,1,B009NNMAZI,"Spoiler Alert..

What a horrid movie. I do not mind the occasional plot hole but this movie was bad bad bad. I finally had enough when the national guard and all other security forces are just 20 yards away watching the President being chased around the WH lawn and a bad guy is hanging out the roof of a chasing vehicle blasting away with a massive machine gun. Finally word is given to move forward and 1 tank rolls, gets hit by a missile fired from the WH house and then the US forces run away.

The attack by delta force was pathetic. They hover near the roof of the WH screaming shoot me shoot me.

I need to check, but I am pretty sure you can not swear in a new president whilst the current one is still alive and you KNOW he is alive.

There was really no reason for the security forces to sit idle through all of this movie. They knew the President was safe with our hero. They would not have hung back just because of a few hostages.

Then we had the child at the end waving the flag on the lawn and still no security forces approach. The mother of course managed to get in before security.

The pilot ignores direct orders just because of 1 child even though world destruction was just seconds away.

5357596,3,B009NNMAZI,"The action is one of the only good things about this movie. Once you move beyond the action everything just falls apart.

Obviously the story is Hollywood and unrealistic, which is expected, but I felt that way with Olympus Has Fallen and this movie makes that one look completely possible. The difference is White House Down wants to have comedic elements, that don't always fit, and this movies story is even more unbelievable. The biggest irritation for me was watching bad guys first come in and take out every guard without even trying, but the second Channing Tatum is involved the bad guys cant hit the broad side of a barn.

I like Jamie Foxx, but he just didn't fit as president. James Woods and Maggie Gyllenhaal had the best performances in the movie.

When watching this type of movie you do have to suspend your disbelief, but the US has the best military and ability out there, and is portrayed as incompetent and unable to do anything in a movie like this which doesn't work for me.

White House Down is decent if you just want to rent a action movie, but really starts to fall apart once you move beyond that. The story becomes so implausible its hard to just accept the fact you are watching a fictional movie.",1383868800,,1227,4.538461538461538

Don't waste your time on this one. Even if you are Dem, you'll be embarassed to be one after you watch this trainwreck. Where have all the good filmakers gone?

An off-duty Capitol policeman and a President who can fight, shoot, and kill like a trained Navy SEAL team up to save the country from terrorists. The ""plot"" is a convoluted mess that barely makes sense. The ""movie"" takes itself oh so seriously it is almost laughable...almost. And the ""acting"" - where to start?

Little do the bad guys know, Cale has special talents and surprises waiting for the bad guy.  I won't say who they are, or what they want because that will just ruin a lot of plot twits, and trust me, there's a lot of them. It's up to Cale to save the president and the day.

There is so much working for this movie. First off, the characters. There isn't a single one that annoyed me. All of them severed their purpose.  You even like to hate the bad guys. The characterization was such a nice touch. It made the movie enjoyable.  This movie is also very funny. I actually laughed out loud in several parts, and I rarely do that.  You want action?

Synopsis of White House Down:
Capitol Policeman John Cale (Channing Tatum) has just been denied his dream job with the Secret Service of protecting President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). Not wanting to let down his little girl with the news, he takes her on a tour of the White House, when the complex is overtaken by a heavily armed paramilitary group.

Synopsis of Olympus Has Fallen:
A terrorist mastermind kidnaps the President of the United States inside the White House, and a disgraced former Secret Service agent must save the President and take down the terrorists.

The bad guys are three or more of the following: white, angry, racist, ex-military,Republicans! Don't they ever get tired of themselves? Apparently not, because the know that if they keep telling the same lies/telling the same stories, the sheeple will believe them! Surprised that they didn't take a jab at Christians, gun control, birthers, etc. while they were at it. I am amazed to be living in an age where the media and Hollywood are so sold out to ideology, that they role out movies and manufacture stories to help bolster the failed foreign policy of the worst president in our nations history. By the way, grenades do not beep a countdown, RPG's CANNOT take out an Abrams tank, and I'm pretty sure the surface to air missiles cannot arm themselves that quickly, RPG's actually would have been the better option. Anyone see Black Hawk Down? Also, I'm pretty sure the National Guard would have rushed the White House lawn during the car chase along with the Abrams. BTW the Abrams didn't need to move, it could have put a SABOT round in each of the SUV's engines EASILY while they were doing donuts around the fountain.

5357698,2,B009NNMAZI,"Foxx is laughable as a President. Tatum takes two steps backward from Side Effects. He mumbles again. James Woods is excellent.

This movie is competent, but absolutely unoriginal. Even the motive of the villains is highly unclear. It's not entirely clear what they ultimately plan to do.

Lastly, they didn't really do anything interesting with the cat and mouse hunt in the White House.

This is one of those entirely forgettable movies. Furthermore, it shows why Gerard Butler has oodles more screen charisma than Tatum. Tatum is handsome, but he has absolutely no charisma. By comparison, Butler seems like Steve Mcqueen.

I usually like Foxx, but he sounds like a man who didn't attend college. Obama is black too, but he sounds like he attended two Ivy universities.

The similarity between Olympus has Fallen and White House Down is sort of shocking. It's like two directors had a competition to make a film with almost exactly the same plot.",1382832000,3,949,4.943396226415095
5357699,4,B009NNMAZI,"I have mixed feeling about WHITE HOUSE DOWN.

As an action movie, it is extremely entertaining; a virtual DIE HARDIN THE WHITE HOUSE.  Interestingly, this was the second film with the same general premise to be released this year.

(Indeed, many years ago, shortly after the original DIE HARD with Bruce Willis was released, I contemplated writing a screenplay with a like basis, but I tabled the idea and went on the other things.)

Channing Tatum plays a decorated Afghanistan vet, now working as capitol policeman and bodyguard for the Speaker of the House of Representatives (Richard Jenkins), who goes to the White House with his young daughter (Joey King) in tow, in order to (unsuccessfully) apply for a job with the Secret Service.  Later, while he and his daughter are still there, the Capitol dome is blown up and a heavily armed paramilitary group, ostensibly led by Jason Clarke, invades the White House.  Now, with the nations government in chaos, it appears that Tatum is the only person who can save his daughter, the President (Jamie Foxx) and the country.

Featuring a strong supporting cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods and Michael Murphy, plus a sensational production design that makes one believe that Washington, D.C. is, in fact, under attack, WHITE HOUSE DOWN shrewdly mixes elements of DIE HARD, AIR FORCE ONE and FAIL-SAFE into a viscerally pleasurable experience.  Director Roland Emmerich does his job and does it well.

My problem with the picture is that the scenario as presented is quite depressing.  I know this is just a movie, but: Would it be that easy to invade and take down the White House?

I don't want to be a Spoiler, but according to this film, all it would take is one or two traitors on the inside to pull this off.

Additionally, I think it was a mistake for the producers and the screenwriter to make the President and other political figures in the film mirror people actually occupying those offices today.  Even though no political parties are mentioned, a clandestine political message is being sent here, as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.

They may have made the movie more topical, but they have also eliminated much of the fantasy element that is so important in this action genre.  If you want to send audiences a serious message, then you make FAIL-SAFE and play it straight.  If you want them to have fun, then you don't make the situation so real that it deflates them.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains four Behind the Scenes featurettes.

5357740,3,B009NNMAZI,"This is the second time we have seen the White House under siege this year on screen, the first being ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Here comes the other one with a more straightforward title. ""White House Down"" is directed by none other than Roland Emmerich, someone best known for sci-fi action ""Independence Day."" Like all of his action films in the past, ""White House Down"" is entertaining in its own way, with a fair amount of CGI-enhanced action, but ends up with something turgid and overblown, even for the genre.

This is a traditional template of action movies. Channing Tatum's hero John Cale, a capitol policeman who happens to be inside the White House with his daughter Emily (Joey King) for job interview, saves the President Sawyer played by Jamie Foxx, when it is attacked and taken over by a group of terrorists. The situation seems pretty incredible, but still serviceable enough as the premise for yet another ""Die Hard""-inspired action movie.

Sadly Roland Emmerich just cannot stop adding things unnecessary to the already bloated storyline. International politics, YouTube images, John Cale's past marriage, etc. Everything slows down the movie, sometimes forgetting Channing Tatum's hero, who should be at the center of the story.

To his credit, Mr. Emmerich did a decent job in creating action sequences, even though they tend to be overlong and repetitious (script by James Vanderbilt of ""Zodiac"" fame). I know I shouldn't take the film too seriously and I confess I enjoyed watching the film pretty much, but also couldn't help think that his latest film was a typical case of less is better than more.",1376697600,5,1621,4.996296296296296

5357743,1,B009NNMAZI,"This summer has had some hits, but it will most likely be remembered for a string of high-profile box office bombs featuring highly-paid stars who usually deliver better films and better box-office. The string of bombs continues with ""White House Down"", the latest Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""2012"") film starring Channing Tatum as Capitol policeman John Cale and Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer.

Emmerich has created an impressive number of very successful summer popcorn films; he isn't trying to make Oscar winners, he is trying to elevate the B movie to an art form. With each new film, he combines wholly improbably plots with corny acting and over-the-top special effects. And it usually works; just the type of thing to spend a couple of hours escaping the hot summer sun while enjoying big handfuls of popcorn and soda.

But ""White House Down"" doesn't. And there are a number of reasons why.

Some people are pointing to the March release of ""Olympus Has Fallen"", a film with a very similar narrative. Every time two different studios decide to release similar films they always end up in a pissing match. Who will be first? Who gets the prime release date? Who has the bigger stars? But ultimately, none of this matters. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" doesn't have the star power of the more recent Emmerich film. But ""Fallen"" had a lower budget and made money. The last time two studios competed, they jockeyed for position and ""Mirror, Mirror"", a terrible film starring Julia Roberts, was released first and flopped badly. A few months later, ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"", a marginally better film, made enough money to warrant a sequel. The lesson learned? Star power and release date don't matter. If ""White House Down"" were a better film, no one would remember or care about ""Olympus Has Fallen"".

The key mistake in ""White House"" is that everyone takes everything so seriously. It's a preposterous story and there needs to be a certain amount of wink-wink. All of the best examples of this genre (""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"") include humor, one-liners and funny tag lines.

Cale is desperate to become a member of the Secret Service and has an interview with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the newly appointed head of the President's security detail. She is replacing Walker (James Woods) who is retiring. Cale brings his daughter Emily (Joey King) to the White House, because she is a history freak and he needs to earn some Daddy points. The interview doesn't go well and Cale decides to put on a happy face for his daughter who urges him to join a tour of the White House. During this time, a group or mercenaries, led by Stenz (Jason Clarke, ""The Great Gatsby"", ""Lawless"") infiltrates the White House and begins to fire bullets, taking control. Cale realizes someone needs to protect the President and the two men quickly elude the terrorists. Little Emily, in the bathroom when the attack begins, can't be discounted and will play a role in the drama.

During the course of the film, Cale will grow and become a hero. That is pretty much a given and something that should not come as a surprise to anyone. But Tatum who let's face it is pretty but not a good actor, fails to give the character anything very deep. I know we are talking about a summer popcorn film, but when the lead character seems to be following instructions, moving from one point to the other with no obvious thought behind the movements, it is difficult to get behind the hero, to feel anything for him. Tatum always seems robotic during his dramatic moments, delivering his lines in a stiff, stilted manner.

Jamie Foxx is okay as President Sawyer. He has done better work in the past, but in ""White House Down"", he manages to display a little of the charisma and bravado he is known for. These qualities make him believable, as much as any character in a film like this is believable, as the Commander In Chief. He also has one or two funny lines, the only funny lines, which help make the film a little more enjoyable.

As the drama continues, various government officials, led by Finnerty and Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) watch from a command center, trying to coordinate the rescue efforts and save the government. Moments on Air Force Two and surveillance video help them watch the drama unfold.

But it is up to Cale to save the President, his daughter and the country.

I think I was most disappointed by the lack of originality in just about every aspect of the narrative and filmmaking. It is an extremely predictable movie. Early on, you realize everything will be the opposite at the end of the film. When this realization occurs, nothing surprises you. Early on, Cale has an argument with his ex-wife (Rachel LeFevre, TV's ""Under the Dome"", ""Twilight"") because he missed Emily's school talent show. ""What did she do?"" ""Flag twirling..."" ""That's a talent?"" Every `big moment', a moment meant to deliver a lot of emotional or dramatic impact is telegraphed in a none too subtle fashion. This means that as soon as you hear this exchange about flag twirling, you know it will lead to a scene of the daughter using this very skill for a big dramatic payoff. However, even more shocking is how much of a blatant rip-off this moment is, borrowing everything practically verbatim from Michael Bay's ""The Rock"". Because it is such a blatant rip-off, any drama is robbed from the moment and it is ultimately a waste of time.

As soon as Cale and President Sawyer get together, they begin to reenact various parts of ""Die Hard"". Unfortunately, the villains aren't memorable and draw attention to the actions of the heroes, giving everything a ""been there, done that"" feeling. Jason Clarke, who was on the short-lived television series ""The Chicago Code"" is working his way up the Hollywood ladder, doing supporting roles in high-profile films. He played virtually the same character in both ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Lawless"" - an adult male with no control over his destiny who becomes a victim of others, so his role here is a bit different. But he doesn't stand out for any reason. One of his cohorts, a computer hacker played by Jimmi Simpson (TV's ""Breakout Kings"", ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") chews up the scenery, but his purpose is never very clear.

James Woods plays Walker, the former head of the President's security detail. He has an ax to grind and this propels a lot of the action in the film.

Roland Emmerich has created imaginative, albeit over-the-top films, which always serve to entertain the audience. But something went wrong with ""White House Down"" it doesn't have the imagination, the power, the outlandish qualities of his other films. It is simply a forgettable film.

At one point my daughter leaned over to me and said, ""Boy this movie is tense!""  She was biting her nails the whole way through! The ladies behind us kept gasping and oohing all the way through.  When it was over all three of them clapped delightedly.  Hope you'll at least give it a try!",1374105600,3,870,4.320987654320987
5357749,3,B009NNMAZI,"I watched the film at the theater when it first came out.  After it was done, I thought the film was three hours.  I was shocked when I checked my watch and the film was only about two hours and five minutes long.  It made me realize how much this movie dragged at times.

For me to give an average review of an Emmerich film is not the norm.  I like many of his films.  Independence Day, 2012, and the Day After Tomorrow are very entertaining films.  Emmerich films are the kind of films that I like to watch in a theater.  They are fun, suspenseful and not preachy at all.  The special effects, of course, are usually the stars of his film.

Unfortunately, this film is closer to 10000 BC.  The movie is not a complete flop, but it is not as good as it could have been.  For whatever reason, the parts did not equal a great engaging film.  There are points where you tire of the film and want it to end.

What gets me is that the first 20 to 30 minutes give you the impression it is going to be a good movie.  It feels like it is going to lead to better things.  It does not happen.  The middle of the film ruins the movie.  When the terrorists take over, the movie slows down and it lacks the action/adventure pump that you wish you see from an Emmerich film.

So why do I give the film three stars?  The film is not bad enough for me to tell you not to watch it.  For one-time watching, it is passable.  I will say that this is not a film you will watch again.  It is not good enough of a movie that you will add to your collection to see it again in a year.",1373932800,13,1562,3.967741935483871
5357750,5,B009NNMAZI,"I went to see this movie with my husband and was pleasantly surprised.  Although I like both of these actors, action films with political themes do not usually hold my interest...however, this film kept moving, kept twisting and turning...held my interest to the end.  I know that some of the situations were a little far fetched, but who cares?  I wanted to see something that would take my mind off of everyday situations and this film did just that!  It had comedy, suspense, and action...I sooooo enjoyed this movie and will buy it on the release date.",1373673600,76,556,4.701030927835052
5357751,4,B009NNMAZI,"The White House in under attack and only Tatum Channing, a wannabe secret service agent can save the world, the POTUS (Jamie Foxx) and protect his 11 year old daughter (Joey King). The movie follows a ""Die Hard"" formula.

There is nothing overly special about this film. It uses the current world situation and creates stock political characters. The scenario ranges from improbable to impossible. Break out the popcorn and enjoy the feature as Channing bonds with his movie daughter and beats up the bad guys against all odds.

I Normally don't go see movies that I already seen in theaters twice but this one I have, I'm thinking about seen it again for the third time before it leaves the theaters. Good action with a little humor in it. Jamie Foxx ""Great"" playing the president he crack me up especially wearing those Air Jordan Tennis Shoes. And Channing Tatum playing Capital policeman ""love him with his fine sexy self"" especially when he had his shirt taking off during halfway through the movie one thing I had too say is, he is HOT,HOT,HOT!!! And his daughter Emily played by Joey King, She Got Girl Power!!! stole the show. Overall good movie.",1373155200,7,674,4.487804878048781
5357753,4,B009NNMAZI,"""I can't think of a more important job then protecting the President."" John Cale (Tatum) is a policeman working in Washington D.C. Trying to reconnect with his young daughter he brings her with him to the White House for his interview with the Secret Service. While there they meet the President (Foxx) and she is having the best day. When a group attacks the White House and goes after the President the only person who is able to help is Cale. Now he has to try and protect both the President and get his daughter out safely. I was pretty excited about seeing this. I am a big Jamie Foxx fan, but I was leery of Tatum (not a fan). I will admit that the chemistry between them was very good and the movie had some very funny parts in this as well as wall to wall action. This is the latest movie in Hollywood's ""I can do it better"" series. Other movies in this club are Deep Impact & Armageddon, Illusionist & Prestige, movies with the same idea coming out close to each other. While Olympus Has Fallen was OK and worth seeing this one was way better and if you had to choose between the two this is the way to go. There really isn't a dull moment in this and I highly recommend it. Overall, not an Oscar type movie and a little predictable but a movie that is very exciting and fun. I really liked it. I give it an A-.",1372982400,75,1320,4.180392156862745

5357756,5,B009NNMAZI,"I don't usually go to the movies to watch ""boys"" movies but we went as a group and that was the flick... so I decided that worse in worse I get a little bored.

Boy, what a ride it was. It was actually an amazing movie. Perfect cinematography, visual effects were stunning, action was fast and kept you guessing and wondering all the time and things were happening like click.. click.. click..

It made you laugh, it made you cry, it made you bite your fingers, it made you cover your eyes and it made you push into your chair.

The movie is a bit violent at times as you can imagine when you have a  terrorist type of situation and attempt to make it realistic.. plus modern effects result in this type of things. However if you can phase out yourself through those moments then you can really be for an amazing ride.

The characters are very believable, very real and very likable or hate-able..
Someone compare this movie to Die Hard. I would say that it is a bit like that
but then it is way more action packed and faster and Die Hard movies are bit older type of school, this was really top notch movie.

I think that having such a young crew of actors from the president through the saving hero and his daughter helped to keep it fresh as opposed old president and all that.. to me it was very up to date.

The girls in our group would close their eyes now and then during the movie but no one of us wanted to leave, we all were like sucked into the action.

I personally loved the full fledge visual effects shown in so many angles and so fast that you were like WOOOOOOOOOOW! You totally felt part of this.. and that is why most all of us, even guys got teary eyes in few moments because
this is not only the action movie, it gets you emotional thinking
what if.. because this is so real looking and it is touching real life
people and real life situations however fictionalized, still you had your
president of your country, your capitol and all inside and the White House staff
and tourists and you could emotionally relate to the whole suffering and trauma..
Luckily the director made sure to lighten up the movie with goofy tour guide who was just plain awesome, with a daughter of the hero who was very likeable teenage girl with bit of attitude yet still likeable.. there were many situations that would really make you laugh.

My most favorite funniest moment (spoiler alert! - don't read if you don't want to know what happens :))  :
When a president and the Hero guy are trapped in the elevator shaft and they trying to get out, the president tells the guy - ""you just show  me what to do and I will do it"".. so the guy jumps spider-style here there and up he goes..
and president looks at him jaw dropped kind of and answers:
""I ain't doing that s*** :)

Oh really funny at times... REALLY funny!

So yes, all in all, very well spend money and time. Memorable movie and definitely something I am going to watch more then once. I hope they won't cut too many scenes when making DVD as they usually make movies shorter. Watch it in the theaters first and so you will know if they did that. Most of my movies I got on DVD that I saw on big screen were ""brutally modified"".

So bottom line.. none of the gals who were at the movie theater complained and all looked totally amazed by it.

Totally recommend, ten thumbs up.",1372809600,8,3335,4.29665071770335
5357757,5,B009NNMAZI,"Seriously, folks. If it wasn't incredibly obvious from the previews this is another PG-13 Die Hard with a different protagonist. It's got all the hilarious quotable quips, loud explosions, elevator climbing, crashing, bullet-flying, popcorn action you'd expect. It's smartly written, well-acted, and entertaining from beginning to end. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Is it silly? Very. It's absolutely what you want and expect from a Die Hard movie. It's also the most likable Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have ever been in my opinion (yes, I actually sat through Step Up, She's the Man, Ray, and Stealth, slightly more traumatized with each new film).

If you are expecting Independence Day or Stargate levels of over-the-top sci-fi battle-royale-with-cheese you will be disappointed. If you just want a rollicking good time with a Die Hard flick set in the White House you're probably going to love this movie. It doesn't have a SINGLE annoying character and I actually laughed at the jokes. The performances by the superb cast are uniformly excellent. The sound, effects, camera-work, and overall direction of the film do not disappoint. Highly recommended to action fans who like things on the over-the-top entertaining side you can crunch popcorn to and wash down with a Slurpee.",1372723200,187,1284,5.263414634146342
5357758,3,B009NNMAZI,"This movie wasn't bad but....it wasn't good either; it was just ""ok"". It seemed slow, even the action scenes were slow!!  I can't quite put my finger on what went wrong with this movie.  Everyone seemed to fall flat in this, even Jamie Foxx who is usually pretty good (all I could see was Malcolm X when he put his glasses on - I'm still trying to figure out if that was their intent?). And I had no idea James Woods (a bad guy as usual) was in this!  Sadly, I found myself wanting to see the terrorists rather than the heroes (I liked the terrorist named Motts for some reason. He was even good at shooting!).  The posters for this movie all looked so good/dramatic but...*sigh* something is just missing.

I think they were trying to recreate a bit of Lethal Weapon with White House Down but the comedic parts weren't funny, the only chuckles I heard were when the WH tour guide did something (however, I did chuckle when Jamie Foxx had to put his glasses on to shoot).  Even the two terrorists who were supposed to be funny...just somehow didn't fit (they did a good job of being 'crazy' but they just didn't seem to be in the right movie?) The action scenes were so drawn out and I couldn't figure out why a guy who was supposed to be a policeman and was in really buff shape got the crap beat out of him by a more scrawny guy.  I think the drawn out action scenes were so we could spend time looking at Channing Tatum.  The poor guy had an awful lot of people to save and plots to finish.

I don't mean to be overly critical because I know it's just a movie and movies (like books) are someone's babies and I do love a good action movie; I think Channing Tatum should really focus on his acting for now (apparently he was also executive producer) and try producing later on when he gets more experience, and hopefully when White House Down is released on DVD, they have taken the time to clean up the scenes somehow, it would speed up the action a bit (maybe there are scenes missing in this or too many scenes and storylines...I'm not sure which one it is - I just can't quite put my finger on it, it's driving me crazy!).  I feel sort of bad for Channing Tatum, he seems to be one of the few decent people in Hollywood (and we need more of those!) that I do want to say something nice about this movie. I certainly wouldn't say I wouldn't watch it again.  I would watch this sometime in the future, like maybe when it's on t.v. or something.  It was ok, but it could've been sooooo much more!  I could like this in the future, it could grow on me.",1372723200,5,2554,4.209016393442623
5357759,2,B009NNMAZI,"Roland Emmerich is as it again; and it looks like Washington DC is in peril in White House Down (seriously what does this guy have against DC). The blockbuster is but the second thriller this year to attack the White House as Gerald Butler was defending the President in Olympus Has Fallen. While I have not yet seen Olympus Has Fallen, it did not help White House Down's advertisement as look like that moviegoers have already seen. Yet perhaps White House Down could stand on its own and be an engaging blockbuster. Engaging is not the word I use for White House, but along the lines of stupid. Before jumping into what makes this film tick, here's the synopsis.

Channing Tatum plays John Cale, a security guard who wants to join the secret service. After being rejected, Cale finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when terrorist attack the White House.  After the Cale saves President Sayer, played by Jamie Foxx, the two must stop the terrorist attack before they lose the heart of the capital.

So what's wrong with White House Down? Well for starter, you can call this movie Die Hard at the White House. It may not look it by seeing the trailers, but this movies has several traits to the 1988 classic, which is not a good thing. The story itself is predictable. Within the first 15 minutes you can figure out how thwe are getting to point a to point b. Does White House Down need a complex plot? No, it doesn't. However, there is one issue that stands in the way of this being enjoyable: the plot is boring.

Even the cast is lackluster, despite everyone having decent performances. Channing Tatum's Cale is your standard action hero. While Jamie Foxx is doing his best impersonation of President Obama; which actually from character of President Sawyer.  Everyone else is either flat, underdeveloped or just annoying. Perhaps the only exception is James Woods and even that is not saying much.

I wish I could say that the action is worth it. Unfortunately, there is nothing to the action scenes. Most of he film's tense moments have been done before, and there is nothing that stands out. The other major to this film is the humor, and you might be able to chuckle at a few things. However, the biggest joke White House Down has to offer is the movie itself.

As blockbuster goes, White House Down is weak. Not even the likes of Channing Tatum or Jamie Foxx can save this film. The movie is your generic action film that borderlines on being a ripoff and just dull to sit through. If want to see film for its stupidity, I say go for it. However, you might just want to wait until the film hits TV before seeing it.",1372636800,12,2637,4.527310924369748
