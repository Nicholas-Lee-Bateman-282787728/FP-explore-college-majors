8486185,1,B001PHP9TE,"This is probably the worst video I have seen ever.

The video seems amateur at best, there are parts in which the guy is out of frame, shots are done out of a 45 degree angle, the DVD seems to have been burn at a home computer at a very low quality.

DVD is oily when it arrived, my guess it was handled poorly by those recording on their home computer. It is so oily that it skips and then it starts all over again because it makes my DVD player hicup.

This is not like any yoga DVD, it is very short sections of different poses, does not take you through any type of workout at all.

P90x yoga is million times better for conditioning than this piece of crap, I will probably trash the DVD and keep the box for some other DVD.",1302048000,5,729,4.006896551724138
