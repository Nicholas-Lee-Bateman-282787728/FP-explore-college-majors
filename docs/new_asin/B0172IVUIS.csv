7489228,5,B0172IVUIS,"Im going to review the 2-channel stereo PCM audio tracks on these seven symphonies, not the video or the 5.1 sound.  I listened to all seven symphonies on an Oppo 105D feeding a Sennheiser HDVD 800 headphone amplifier driving a pair of Sennheiser HD800 headphones with Sennheiser's XLR connector. Audio cables were Audience Au24s.  I am pleased to report that, as a full set of Sibelius symphonies, this is unequivocally the finest (Ill list all the Sibelius sets Ive owned and listened to shortly, so you know Im not just comparing it to one or two other interpretations/recordings  and that I take my Sibelius very seriously).

There are surely some individual symphonies where one could legitimately argue that another recording, going toe-to-toe, bests that particular symphony in the Lintu set. So keep in mind that Im referring to the set as a set.

The sound is stunning (despite audience coughs here and there) and the interpretations masterful, both factors keeping me on the edge of my seat through most of these recordings. These boys didn't phone it in. After pulling my headphones off, I concluded that if I was allowed to own only ONE set of Sibelius symphonies, it would have to be this set, despite the merits of many of the following sets which I own and have had the joy of listening to (to varying degrees). For the record, I had just finished listening to the Rattle/BPO set on Blu-Ray audio before going through the Lintu set here, and it was a difference of day and night IMHO in favor of Lintu.

I make this comparative assessment in respect to the other Sibelius sets I own, which are these:  Maazel/VPO (both on CD and on newly remastered Blu-Ray Audio), Rattle/BPO Blu-Ray Audio, Kamu/Lahti SACD,  Storgards/BBC, Rozhdestvensky/Moscow, Abravanel/Utah, Sanderling/Berlin SO, Blomstedt/SFO, Oramo/CBSO, Ashkenazy/Philharmonia, Segerstam/Helsinki, all three Berglund sets, Barbirolli/Halle, Davis/BSO, Bernstein/VPO, Bernstein/NY, Vanska/Lahti, and various one-offs (Ormandy, Mravinsky, all the Karajan versions, and others.)",1456876800,6,2048,5.28
7489229,4,B0172IVUIS,"There arte positives and negatives about this set, and while I don't want to dwell on whether or not we need a complete set of Sibelius symphonies on video, if you know his music and think that some of his symphonies don't need this attention, then I recommend you get the Bernstein incomplete set. They got far enough into the cycle (I think) to do you well.

As for this project: I think it will be a while before anyone else decides to do the full Sibelius, so in my view this is where you'll want to put your money. It's doubtful that any future release will be significantly better, as this is very good. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon, and the finer quibbles which people remark on are informative, but it's rare that they matter to my ears.

There is also a positive to this set which I haven't seen in many other classical blue-rays I've bought, and that's an interview with the conductor discussing elements of the symphony. That's a step forward, as is the kind off dress rehearsal which illustrates his points. To me, however, these discussions are kind of superficial; and what I'd love to see in the rehearsal footage is actual dialog between the conductor and the orchestra, with him saying stuff like ""here's what I want from you."" But my wishes of what they should have done are no more germane than commenting on their choice about doing a complete Sibelius cycle. This was their choice.

One other choice I question (and this one bugs me) is the bloated packaging. There are three discs in this set, and each is in its own separate clam shell. We all know it doesn't have to be that way, they could put three in one. Secondly, the box contains a very thick catalog off other offerings. AND it contains an empty ""sub"" box to fill up the space of the box they put it all in. Wait, I'm not done! The box for this set has a snug lid which needs to be slowly slid off a close-fitting bottom. It's an exercise in delaying your getting to the music. This doesn't make sense to me by any stretch.",1456790400,4,2009,4.366310160427807
7489230,4,B0172IVUIS,"The performances are truly excellent.  The sound is superb.  I wonder, however, if anyone has experienced a problem in the Blu-ray version with the image ""jumping"" suddenly possibly because of some electronic glitch in the signal from the disk. I have already received a replacement, but the problem persists.  The defect may be in my Blu-ray player.  Also, why at this point are posted only three (3) reviews of this outstanding collection?!",1456185600,,442,5.097222222222222
7489231,5,B0172IVUIS,"I only received this beautifully packaged set a couple of days ago, however I will try to continue to update this review as I work through the symphonies.  Based on my first impressions, however, this will be all pleasure and no work!

The production is very high quality.  Sound is powerful in the higher volume sections, yet detailed in lower volume sections.  In my samples, the audience is very respectful of allowing a full decay of reverberation at the end of works prior to applauding.  Applause is not intrusive at all (perhaps it has been modified with a reduced volume level?), and it gracefully fades into the closing credits without having to sit through what must have been numerous curtain calls.  This treatment, combined with silence during the credits provides some welcomed space in which to contemplate the emotions which have come before.  The main Blu-ray menu (which is easy to navigate) does have background music (somewhat regretfully), but I find that I have ""recovered"" by this time ...and there is sufficient time provided if you wish to stop playback before this sound intrusion.

I chose Symphony No. 5 as my introduction to the set.  I own only 1 complete set of the Sibelius symphonies on CD (Saraste with this same orchestra, on a good sounding Finlandia CD issue), which I have probably listened to about 10+ times over the past 15+ years, and I am not sufficiently versed in Sibelius to offer a detailed critique of each symphony.  I can state with confidence, however, that this performance felt extraordinarily committed - both by conductor and performers alike.  I enjoyed the sense of ""event"" that I believe is so important in the most special of classical video productions.  This was a performance that brought me ""into the hall"", and I felt the reverence by all involved (including the audience) for the composer.

I would use the following words to describe Symphony No. 5:  powerful, transparent, impassioned, focused, intense, and ultimately uplifting.  The musicianship and musical decisions sounded perfect to my ears - with great attention to matters of phrasing, tempo, and dynamics.  I'm unable to comment on accuracy to the printed score, or to contrast to other performances ...but I can say that this was an obviously well thought out interpretation, exquisitely prepared and performed, yet impetuous and spontaneous.

My experience of the Symphony No. 5 was worth the price of the entire set to me, which is why I felt compelled to write this review.  I have since followed with Symphony No. 7 and Symphony No. 2.  I noted in these 2 latter performances what I thought may have been a little bit of timidness at times and perhaps a couple of mis-coordinated entries, but these did not detract from the overall commitment and impact of the performances.  Very satisfying indeed!  My partner, who is not a classical music aficionado, has commented on elements of ""movie music"" in these Sibelius works.  I think this is a result of moods and themes that can change rather quickly at times, as well as many memorable tunes.  Anyone not familiar with Sibelius may perhaps find these comments useful if making a decision to explore this music for the first time.

From my limited viewing to date, the supplemental material (introductions and thematic overviews for each work, as well as biographical context) is very well produced and will facilitate me in broadening and deepening my understanding of Sibelius and these works.

I have no hesitation in recommending others to embark on this ""Sibelius journey"" with Hannu Lintu and his Finnish Radio orchestra.",1450310400,3,3606,4.979966611018364
7489232,5,B0172IVUIS,"This is a very comprehensive package indeed consisting, not only performances of the complete seven symphonies, but also including significant documentary content. That falls into three categories as follows.

Each symphony is preceded with an optional pair of short documentary items. The first gives a general historical background with a mixture of archive and current film material and provides a generalised setting for the next documentary piece. This is a conversation between the conductor and his interviewer. During this the work in question is, in effect, analysed with the various themes and key points of the music played by the orchestra and with the musical notation highlighted during the playing.  This is a valuable resource that will be enlightening to both inexperienced and experienced collectors. It will repay repeat viewing at appropriate times. These seven preliminary films can be seen as a complete hours documentary and can be avoided during normal playback of the concerts.

There is one other documentary perhaps tellingly entitled Sort of Sibelius.  This is a collection of short glimpes, to be kind, and may not be to everyones taste. It is unlikely to be played more than once and lacks the informative heft of the other documentaries described in the previous paragraph.

The recordings of the symphonies were made at live concerts in the Helsinki Music Centre which is a vast and impressive concert hall. Symphonies 3 and 4 were recorded on 02/11.12, symphonies 6 and 7 on 10/01/14, symphony 2 on 08/05/13 and symphony 5 on 04/09/14. Throughout the series the recording delivers impressively natural and wide-ranging sound and the visuals are particularly crisp. The static (possibly stage) camera positions are changed through the series and focus on different players as a consequence. The remaining cameras are able to zoom in from considerable distances to close focus. This is seamlessly done with just two exceptions during the final symphony where the rear right camera, starting its retreating zoom from close focus, is completely out of focus for 11 seconds each time before achieving sharpness at 12.10 and 18.59 seconds. Although surprising, this is a very minor blip in hours of visual presentations. It might be an imaginative use of cameras but its value seems unconvincing!

The layout of the orchestra changes with the horns moving between the rear left and rear right.  There is also quite a lot of changing personnel among the players. More significantly the string layout has both sets of violins to the left, the cellos centre, the violas on the right and the basses on the right behind the violas. This is a regular pattern used these days and delivers a well-balanced live stage sound. It also emphasises the desirability of playback equipment to have same sized centre speakers to match the main left and right so that the stage emphasis is naturally reproduced at home. The sound is presented in excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 as well as stereo.

The performances are clearly the result of many experiences in concert and have that resultant ease of familiarity, delivery and understanding. The conductor worked with the orchestra prior to taking his current role of chief conductor of the orchestra in 2014 but the orchestral members appear steeped in the Sibelian idiom as one might expect. The performances themselves could be described overall as very main-stream and there are no interpretive surprises. Within that description Hannu Lintu, the conductor, gives his individual solo players room to express themselves while still keeping a tight control over ensemble and tempo.

The opening clarinet solo in the first symphony is a case in point and is a gripping experience to behold. Tempi are frequently chosen to maximise dramatic effects as are dynamics. There are therefore considerable points of brisk tempi generating excitement as well as examples of steady tempi allowing for considerable sensitivity or weight. The conclusions of symphonies 3 and 5 are approached to give a sense of musical satisfaction rather than exhilaration and the reverse is true of the conclusion to the first movement of the fifth symphony. All of these comments are given within traditional expectations.

At the moment this set has no alternative competition to fear. The standard throughout is sufficiently high and rewarding to make it likely that, for many purchasers, this will be the only view of the symphonies they will need. Other collectors, with existent allegiances to Sanderling, Vanska, Karajan, Gibson, Monteux and others famed for particular recordings will still find much to enjoy and learn from by buying this set which would be best thought of, in those circumstances, as offering additional rather than replacement value.

This review is not intended to be a detailed analysis of every component of this considerable undertaking. That would be disproportionately lengthy in the circumstances. However, it should be clear that the whole concept of notable performances supported by good documentary discussion and material will make this a hard act to follow let alone supersede.",1450310400,10,5153,5.241504854368932
7489233,5,B0172IVUIS,"This blu ray set gets my vote for the most significant release of the year. For a start, it's the first and only Sibelius symphony set offered in blu ray. Second, it's so good that I'm afraid of running out of superlatives before I complete this review.

I had not previously heard of conductor Hannu Lintu, the Finnish conductor, nor had I heard the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra play. What a revelation! And I am no Sibelius neophyte. I have the partial Bernstein dvd set that he made but did not complete before his death. It is compromised by Lenny's late slowness in tempi. I also have the early Bernstein/NPO cd set, as well as those by Maazel (both), Collins,Berglund, Davis & many single symphonies by other estimable conductors.

This set is an absolute revelation. I guess the Finns know their own music the best. Lintu plays the symphonies at quite a clip. He is, however not afraid to apply the brakes when it works for the music, not for his ego. There are also sections where he really quietens down the music, and the results are breathtaking. This is how the music of Sibelius should sound. None of the overly romantic, self aggrandising wallowing here, just the soul of the Finnish people expressed by a conductor and orchestra that have this stuff in their bones. On a side note, I was delighted to see that at least 50% of the players are women! Take note, Vienna Philharmonic!

I will not attempt to analyse the individual performances here. There are none that are less than outstanding, and these discs have hardly been out of my blu ray player since I received them. I have watched and listened to all seven at least twice. There are also some detailed explanations of each piece by Lintu, as well as some interesting biographical documentary about Sibelius that I watched part of. I just wanted to get back to the music.

Not much of this would matter if the audio and video weren't superb, but they are. Outstanding surround sound, and terrific camera work come standard here. Eveything was recorded in the brand new Helsinki Music Centre, which has terrific acoustics.

Visually, Lintu is very entertaining to watch. He is definitely from the Bernstein school of podium choreography - arms whirling, abundant facial expressions, and plenty of smiles and encouragement for his players, who are clearly fond of him. He isn't, however, frequently airborne, as was Lenny's habit, just a very graceful man who is a good dancer.

What you will experience  in these discs are new insights into dynamic shading and phrasing. I have not heard anything like it before in recorded Sibelius.

i bought my set from Amazon Germany, because it was released earlier than by Amazon.com., for $55 delivered, courtesy of the /$ ratio.

If you buy nothing else this year, and like or love Sibelius, buy this set! It really is something special!",1449705600,16,2853,4.77079107505071
8737997,3,B0172IVUIS,"The performances are excellent, but the audiovisual quality is a bit disappointing. Although the overall audio quality is okay, it does not have good stereo separation: All the instrument sound as if they are coming from the center of the sound stage. Similarly, the video is good quality but the shot selection is erratic. Overall, it spends too much time showing the conductor and too little time on the players. This is a problem with a number of orchestra video productions: Many seem to be produced as vanity pieces for the conductor: dwelling excessively on his mugging and gyrations. This is not as bad as some others. On some of the performances it strikes a good balance, but, several of the symphonies would be improved if the producer had spent more time showing the players and less time on Lintu.",1504310400,,809,4.785714285714286
8737998,5,B0172IVUIS,"I have enjoyed these video performances of the 7 symphonies of Sibelius. Very nice to see a Finish conductor and Finish orchestra play these works by the greatest of their native composers. Lintu's performances are superb, certainly comparable to those of Ashkenazy, but seeing these performed in video is especially rewarding.  Particularly of interest is the ""introduction"" to each of these symphonies.  Lintu, with interesting period and current images, discusses Sibelius's life at  around the time of each composition and also provides an analysis of each symphony. Interesting to learn about the novel structures of the symphonies--never thought about the fact that there are 8 distinct themes in the 1st movement of the 2nd symphony.  Overall very rewarding performances of these masterful works.",1493337600,,803,5.504065040650406
8737999,5,B0172IVUIS,"Excellent Blu-Ray recording of Sibelius' 7 symphonies. I have several Sibelius collections on CD (Davis-LSO, Essential Sibelius, with Vanska/Jarvi, Berglund) and this one is overall the best one in terms of tempo, sonics and balance. The audio and video recording quality is excellent. The Finnish Radio Symphony under Hannu Lintu's direction performs in superb fashion for the most part. I found Lintu's analysis of each Symphony quite informative as well. I love all of Sibelius' symphonies (preference order: 5-2-3-4-7-1-7) but am disappointed that Kullervo, which I also love, is not included. A must buy for any Sibelius affectionato!",1489017600,,639,5.530612244897959
8738000,3,B0172IVUIS,"The boxed set of the Sibelius 7 Symphonies recorded by Lintu for Art Hau Muik deserves both applause and censured.

First, Bravo! Lintu and the Finnish Radio Symphony provide vigorous and stirring performances of the 7 symphonies, beautifully captured, both socially and visually by Art Haus. However, that is not half of the matter. The recording is 10 hours long with more than half devoted to explaining the symphonies, making Sibelius and his music more accessible. If one looks at the third disc of the set, there is but 1 symphony, a 22:37 recording of the seventh.  That is preceded by a 9:25  introduction by Lintu and a 19:25discussion of the themes of the symphony by Lintu and a moderator with segments of the symphony used as illustrations. DThe symphony is followed by Lintu documentary on Sibelius and his symphonies by Lintu, including an introduction an a seasgment on each symphony; that on the 7th symphony is 9:808 minutes long.

All of these materials --  monologues, dialogues, and documentary are in Finniish, although the Amazon description says the language is English. English subtitle are available for those willing and able to  read 5+ hours of flickering commentary. Here Art Haus is to be dfdaulted for not preparing and releasing a dubbed versison of the commentaries as a selectable option. Instead, it ways most of us down with useless material  together with packaging that as others have noted is also needlessly bulky.",1483315200,,1454,5.008298755186722
8738001,5,B0172IVUIS,"To be clear, I haven't bought the set, but I've seen nearly all the symphonies and documentaries on TV.  The performances are great - Lintu is a wonderful conductor and the Finnish Radio Symphony is a scandalously under-recognized orchestra on the international scene; the energy and engagement of the musicians  - and their understanding of the music - is infectious.  I've heard many renditions of these symphonies and I'm not going to compare, but they're as good as any I've heard.  The visuals are great; the Helsinki Concert Hall, where the performances are recorded, is spectacular, and many parts of the documentaries are filmed in other European cities.

My one quibble that will probably have me dismissed as a self-absorbed American is that I wish Lintu had spoken English in the documentaries.  He's surely a fluent English speaker, and while doing it in Finnish may make it more authentic, English would have made the documentaries user-friendly to a wider international audience.  It gets a little annoying to have to read the subtitles after a while.  But it won't affect your enjoyment of the wonderful performances.",1483056000,,1132,5.081081081081081
8738002,5,B0172IVUIS,"Let me contribute to the mostly raves here.  I had no idea what to expect but I thought it would be fun to own this on Blu-ray, despite the hefty price tag.  And it's worth every penny of that hefty price tag.  I've been traversing many complete sets of the Sibelius symphonies.  Most have their pleasures, and some, for me, are outright failures sometimes due to sound issues in the recordings.  But this Blu-ray set pretty much blew me away.  Mr. Lintu is fun to watch, and the Finnish orchestra plays beautifully and with much passion.  It's amazing how WATCHING a symphony unfold when musicians are being highlighted as in these videos can change one's perception of the music as well as reveal details you might not have been aware of just listening.  Lintu's interpretations are all fine and some are superb and they are certainly better than some of the lauded sets that I've been majorly disappointed in, most especially Colin Davis. But that's all subjective - a performance either gets to you or it doesn't, and what gets to some of these five-star reviewers on Amazon certainly doesn't get to me, and vice versa, I'm sure.  The sound is clear and detailed, unlike my recent SACD purchase of the Kamu set on BIS - that had no chance with me thanks to the muffled, indistinct sound - who wants to hear music that way?  Not me.  Not that I was really enamored of Kamu's versions of any of the symphonies.  Contrast that with the Barbirolli recordings made forty-something years prior and which sound absolutely amazing (his is, at this point, my favorite set of these symphonies) and one wonders how such a recording could be made in this era.

Anyway, back to this set - I was quite taken with Lintu's version of the third and fifth especially and the fourth was really something special, I thought.  In the fifth, I was waiting for my favorite moment in just about any symphony, where it builds into the majestic tune - I was initially taken aback by just how slow Lintu finally does it, but somehow it's just so majestic I went with it.  It's not Barbirolli but it's damn fine.  I'm looking forward to watching some of the extras and I, unlike another fellow here, like the packaging very much.",1481414400,,2205,4.586734693877551
8738003,5,B0172IVUIS,"This is an extremely worthwhile set and I agree with reviewers who opine that it may be a while--if ever--before its bettered. It could well become a ""baseline"" experience that enhances your understanding and enjoyment of the Sibelius symphonies going forward.

This may well be for you if you're looking for a well crafted (and well performed) DVD set of the 7 Sibelius symphonies, and one which comes with a detailed discussion and analysis of each symphony.

What adds considerably to the allure is the conductor Hannu Lintu, an emerging force in Baltic music and a thoughtful advocate of the Sibelius genre. His renditions are not only very good, but also quite distinctive. Both his interpretations and commentary may cause you to hear, see and think about some of the Sibelius oeuvre differently. The Finnish Radio Symphony is a moderate sized orchestra but they know their Sibelius and are in great form. I'd say theirs sonic footprint is closer to the recent Okku Kamu Sibelius set on BIS with Lahti, and less like the more upholstered sound of the BPO under Karajan (or on the recent Rattle multi-media extravaganza, which is the closest competitor in format). The size and approach fits the music well, and keeps all the musical strands transparent.

The visual experience here also is wonderful, and clearly well thought out. It reinforces the commentary. A real treat. Lintu is also a bit of a showman...animated on the podium; one reviewer likened him to ""Bernstein without the jumping"", which is apt. Is he conducting with his arms or his eyebrows?

But its also very educational. Even after having been immersed in ""Sibeliana"" for many years, I found it very educational to have a detailed analysis before each symphony. The commentary not only highlights the Sibelian context--the composer himself-- but also the larger musical world in which he operated. These are documentary-like introductions, and focused interviews of the conductor by a noted Finnish musicologist and composer. Lastly there is a movement-by-movement description of each symphony, featuring rehearsal snippets.

For me, this all-encompassing package was pretty appealing; but having another Finnish conductor with great Sibelius ""chops"" giving a well-rendered symphony cycle also made it pretty much irresistible.

Would anyone consider Lintu's interpretations ""definitive"", or ""best in class""? Maybe, maybe not; it's an individual judgement call. Much of this music is so enigmatic that it defies easy categorization and has (like most major symphony cycles) given rise to constant mythologizing among commentators, audiences and critics. Long-held wives' tales of thematic motivations behind this or that symphony often turn out to be red herrings. But..the more you keep delving into this music the more it gives back.

Even after owning countless  Sibelius symphonic sets and one-off performances, I'm still no closer to identifying a handful of performances of each symphony that I could claim obliterate all other comers. But Lintu's  are well ""up there"" and can stand up in a very competitive field. At the very least they're extremely well--and some times excellently--done. And he will increasingly be one to watch. Lintu's rendition of the Lemminkainen legends op 22 have received critical acclaim, as has his recent set of the violin concerto with that of Thomas Ades with Agustin Hadelich as soloist.

I believe these particular DVDs will reward repeated viewings (or listening, if you find the visuals somehow distracting.) This includes both the music and the introductions. For example, the intro to symphony #4 is almost as long as the symphony itself and could be a stand-alone lecture. Maybe this music will be as enigmatic as ever for me, but I now have a much wider perspective on it.

An additional CD contains a whimsical set of films on aspects of Sibelius' character and personality. These wear thin after a while, when the proportion of useful info on Sibelius vs pure artistic whimsy diminishes. I suspect most buyers will watch these once and then not return to them. The whimsical films are interspersed with small interview snippets with Kaija Saariaho (labeled ""the Sibelius of our time"".) I wouldn't dispute this latter distinction in the slightest; she's one of a trio of Finnish composers--including Magnus Lindberg and Esa-Pekkan Salonen--who continue to carry the torch on 21st century Finnish music. However, I do wish they'd interviewed Saariaho about some weightier musical topics, instead of what part clothing fashion plays in her self-image or whether an artists insecurities can lead them to drink excessively.

Other reviewers have noted some nits and nats on the overall production, including the packaging, the lack of extra rehearsal sequences,  etc etc.

One reviewer suggested that the introductory material was some what ""surface"" and too general. For the in-depth Sibelius specialist, maybe so. But for the rank-and-file Sibelius enthusiast, I don't think it's too general. Besides, anyone wanting a really good blow-by-blow, measure-by-measure analysis of these works should consult David Hurwitz' book entitled ""orchestral works of Sibelius: an owners manual"". Additionally, a good all-around biography of Sibelius is the one by Guy Rickards.

However, what's on offer here is so generous, and so well done, that one should resist the temptation to get too greedy. I'd highly recommend this set.",1474761600,,5435,5.29616724738676
