5008843,5,B006OA8BJM,"Didn't know how I would like a new inspector Barnaby! Loved him! Neil Dudgeon is great! Same great format, same great acting. Sorry to say I didn't miss John Nettles, which really surprised me! Thought nobody could fill his shoes! Must be the good writing because I liked this series just as well! Have already watched series fifteen and wasn't disappointed. Waiting for sixteen to be put on sale, Not going to pay that ridiculous price!",1413331200,17,437,4.7631578947368425
5008844,5,B006OA8BJM,I have watched all the Episodes and have loved this series from the beginning until the end.  I do miss John though.,1381795200,9,116,4.2727272727272725
5008845,5,B006OA8BJM,I am enjoying the new Inspector Barnaby.  The stories are interesing and then show is just fun.  I wish that my Public Broadcast Stations carried it.,1355270400,11,149,4.6923076923076925
5008846,5,B006OA8BJM,Midsomer Murders - A British Classic - just superb entertainment. Why cannot we produce quality like this is the States ??,1515628800,,122,4.857142857142857
5008847,5,B006OA8BJM,"We weren't sure we'd like the show without John Nettles, however we liked Jason Hughes enough to give it a try. It's still great; the two actors work well together, Jason Hughes has more to do in the storylines and we're very pleased. Thank you!",1513814400,2,245,4.466666666666667
5008848,5,B006OA8BJM,"I was pleasantly surprised with the series' new man, Tom Barnaby's cousin John.  Well produced, well acted and always entertaining, even when it's a bit farfetched.",1503619200,,164,5.3076923076923075
5008849,3,B006OA8BJM,This guys wife is certainly no where near as good as the character Joyce Barnaby.  This guy is ok but they are making more a story around his wife.  It should not be about her and the couple is not as well suited as Tom and Joyce Barnaby.  The story lines are just ok.  I am disappointed with this series.  The first 13 were terrific.  I could care less about watching more.,1502668800,,374,4.125
5008850,1,B006OA8BJM,"Very juvenile, tasteless, gratuitous, poorly acted (but mostly poorly written), Yes, I can't say enough about this set. We started watching the Midsomer episodes from the earliest set and found them to be, on average, good quality who-done-its.  That changed abruptly with this set. On the plus side, I only saw the first two episodes, the last two may be the greatest work of mankind, I'll never know; This is going back.",1501286400,,422,4.861111111111111

5008854,5,B006OA8BJM,"If you have not had the pleasure of being a ""Midsomer Murders"" fan, then you have a great deal to look forward to. A sublime experience. Personally, those early episodes with John Nettles are definitely my favorite, but the entire collection are uniquely wonderful.",1497571200,,265,5.045454545454546

5008864,3,B006OA8BJM,"Series 14:

I miss Tom Barnaby and the sense of whimsy, comedy, and lightness that series 1-13 demonstrated... I also miss the enchanting explorations into British traditions.

Series 14 is much darker and intense:  there's even a creepy episode with a random serial killer!  I do like John's wife... and i hope we get to see more of her independent character.",1485388800,2,360,4.852459016393443

5008873,5,B006OA8BJM,"What can be said about the finest series of crime thriller stories? The same powerful plots, great twists, all loose ends tied at the end, excellent main characters, and the craziest bunch of village residents outside a psych ward!  Series 14 is a good as all those before.  Keep them coming!",1472256000,,292,4.705882352941177
5008874,2,B006OA8BJM,"I have enjoyed all series of this show until this one.  Every single episode revolved around religious fanatics.  As fanatical as the characters in these episodes were about different religions, the writers were as fanatical in their contempt for people of faith... any faith.  It's become cliche!.
I loved Midsomer Murders and looked forward to every season, but this is the last I will purchase.",1471737600,6,397,5.076923076923077
5008875,4,B006OA8BJM,"Abrupt changes are almost never welcomed.  Especially when everything was fine the way it was.  Naturally, the real DCI Barnaby is sorely missed.  His replacement cousin is adequate.  The replacement for Dr. George Bullard is also just adequate.  Cousin Barnabys wife is a bit abrasive.  DS Ben Jones has turned into an insufferable prat.  But!  The mysteries remain the same (although they have cut down on the number of bodies found).  There are 8 mysteries in this set.  They fall back on some of their favorite themes for murder: incest, blackmail, greed, lust, the usual motives.  I liked this set well enough to keep for future viewings.  Im debating though whether to continue buying the series after this set.",1471564800,5,717,4.932773109243698

5008877,5,B006OA8BJM,"Very enjoyable Midsomer Murder episodes. I've enjoyed all the series so far, and will continue buying later series I don't have yet. Stories are well done and the murderer's identity not all that easy to guess (at least in my case).",1470355200,,232,4.682926829268292

I really enjoy how he plays John Barnaby and the difference he brings to the series.

5008880,4,B006OA8BJM,"I wanted to like John Barnaby.  I really did. The show is still entertaining, but Neil Dungeon's Barnaby is a smug, prissy, annoying, bland, finger-wagging-politically-correct-old-lady jerk.  He has zero chemistry with anyone. Would that they'd kill him off.",1462233600,8,258,5.7631578947368425

5008889,5,B006OA8BJM,Like this series.  I have all of them.,1452124800,,38,3.75
5008890,5,B006OA8BJM,"I've watched all the episodes of Midsomer with the original Barnaby and wondered how the new Barnaby would be on his own - the new one had helped out the original in at least one episode in an earlier series. With Series 14, we have the changing of the guard.

So far, I think I might prefer the new Barnaby over the original.

The third episode in this 14th series, Echoes of the Dead, was really something. Many red herrings. The second murder in it seemed much more gruesome than any I can remember before in any other episode I've seen. All of the killings were truly unsettling. The killer's rapid striking near the end was a departure from other episodes. The whistling by the killer, the outfit worn, the weapon carried and the killer's manner in the climax was masterful - very scary. A truly great episode, though the ending seemed a little off - suffice it to say that Barnaby's attitude towards the killer was inconsistent.

I look forward to watching further doings in Midsomer.",1451088000,3,990,4.581920903954802

5008895,3,B006OA8BJM,"I iound myself in agreement with other reviewers who did not believe this series is continuing (with its new leading man) to demonstrate the quality and enjoyment of the previous productions. I sense budget constraints--fewer dollars invested in production, perhaps? Too bad,",1440979200,6,275,5.571428571428571
5008896,5,B006OA8BJM,Great viewing.  The new Barnaby does a great job.  Hate to say this he may even be better than the old Tom Barnaby.,1439510400,,115,3.9565217391304346

5008903,5,B006OA8BJM,"The Brits really know how to do a production, whether mystery, comedy, whatever. The actors always look so believable, like real people, not like American actors with lighting, filtering, tons of makeup and phony accents. Granted, I have a problem with some of the characters as they are Cockney, but it doesn't detract from the overall scheme of the plot. Neil and Jason are superb actors with a supporting cast in each series that is equal to the challenge. The only detraction of this series...I have duplicated ordering the same movie because the box will say ""Series 14"" and then ""Season 13"" (not an accurate example) and there are the same movies I already have. When this happened, I passed along my duplicates for friends who are now also hooked on this series. Hope it continues for a long time. Great writing, great acting, beautiful scenery...a real overall winner!!",1436313600,4,877,4.89261744966443

5008905,4,B006OA8BJM,"Okay, but the series seems to have become ever more formulaic. I also personally didn't find John Barnaby as appealing as Tom Barnaby, & was disappointed in the rewriting of the Bullard character. He has gone from providing reliable answers to all questions forensic, to being mostly wrong so the new Barnaby can show off how much more clever he is.",1434672000,10,349,4.737704918032787
8501734,5,B006OA8BJM,I got this because I wanted to see what the series was like without 'Tom Barnaby' which I've been watching on PBS for years. I like it just as much which is a compliment. Well done you!,1528934400,,185,4.027027027027027
8501735,5,B006OA8BJM,"LOVE this entire series!  Wasn't sure I would like the new/younger Barnaby, but he's growing on me.  It's the same but different...once I finish the entire series, I'll probably start over again--they are that good.",1526083200,,215,5.114285714285714

8501737,3,B006OA8BJM,I really wanted to like the new lead as much as the last. Or at least think he was interesting. In this first series with him his character is a bit ill-defined still. I'll probably try one more to see if he gets into it better. I think the writers were still feeling their way with the changes in these episodes.,1521331200,,313,4.147540983606557
