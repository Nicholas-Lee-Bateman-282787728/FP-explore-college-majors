2417324,5,B000BI5MQI,"I cannot even begin to describe how much this is worth a purchase for your own enjoyment. I don't want to give away any secrets, because it is truly best if you can see it from beginning to end without knowing all the twists and turns. What I can say is this: you WILL recognize the brilliance of one Mr. R. Kelly by the time you're starting to understand why he named a character Bridget.

There's no doubt about it, the song is LAZY. It goes on for over 40 minutes and the beat never changes. That said, as the story unfolds, it is so CRAZY that you will laugh harder than you've ever laughed before. My sides hurt before we even got to Chapter 10. It does clearly end with a cliffhanger and so I am hoping that Chapters 13-25 will begin to surface soon. I will buy it faster than you can say ""didn't he urinate on an underage girl?""

Please note: even though this is supposed to be the uncut version (which carries a parental advisory sticker and it loaded with profanity), there is still some editing of language in Chapter 6. I'm not sure if this is a mistake or if those lines are supposed to be altered for some reason.",1130803200,2,1126,4.232558139534884
2417325,2,B000BI5MQI,"r. kelly maybe songwriter of our generation but this is a load of crap..... I was a fan of the first 5 chapters when it first premiered and i was shocked. now he came with the other 7 and it is not the same, the story is just turning to another episode of NICK CANNONS WILD N' OUT....

this story is just getting random and is not adding up...

i think that it should have stopped at CHAPTER 7 just because it would end on a better note...

at the end of the day, it is just too much drama with a over pour of silliness and R.Kelly should stop before it goes too far...

2417329,5,B000BI5MQI,"Released on the eve of R. Kelly's court date, where he faced some serious charges and a very incriminating videotape, the first five chapters of the Closet Cycle confused, amazed, and delighted his fans. The entirety of the series, including all 12 chapters, is sure to have the same effect. Essentially an R&B soap opera, complete with the sets, lighting, convoluted plotlines, and scandalous secrets of daytime TV, TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET features its star and a cast of characters very literally acting out the actions the song describes. The plot involves numerous infidelities, a homosexual affair, a gun, and--as this is an R. Kelly piece of work--at least one steamy sex scene. The attention to detail is astounding, hilarious, and typical of Kelly, as he describes everything from the fear he experiences while hiding from his lover's husband, to the leg cramp he gets while having sex with his wife. Kelly's smooth vocals give voice to everything, even as the different characters mouth the lyrics. Though the project recalls the cheating themes of old blues songs, evokes the look of daytime drama, and contains the controlled raunchiness of vintage Kelly, it's safe to say that TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET represents a new direction in R&B, and is like nothing else audiences have ever seen before.

2417344,5,B000BI5MQI,"This saga began with just one song. It told the tale of an unfaithful man who raced to get home before his wife found out. Then the festival of plot twists began.

Everybody is cheating on everybody else, the cops are at hand, somebody might have more than a metaphorical closet in mind, if you know what I mean... With every song and video in the series, Kelly unleashed enough bizarre ideas to power several seasons of a t.v. show. What the hell was this all about? What was going to happen next?

Kelly's song cycle had people calling radio shows and guessing like mad as to what the upcoming songs had in store. It was bizarre, it was hysterical, it was one good song rewritten a million different ways. And according to R. Kelly himself, it was supposed to be a never-ending loop. There would, or there will, always be new chapters. Good crimony! At least that's different.

This DVD is like a madcap novel or devilish play. I haven't seen something this bonkers and yet enthralling since ""Deathtrap."" With this story, R. Kelly actually makes pop into something new. I don't like very much pop at all, but I like this a lot.",1191024000,,1129,4.4975609756097565

2417349,2,B000BI5MQI,The first chapter is tolerable but the rest of this to be honest: is a mess. Its predictable and stupid.

2417351,4,B000BI5MQI,"Once you watch these, you will be hooked. Whether it's to bash it, laugh along with it or at it, or to even..*gasp* love it, it really has something for everyone.

R. Kelly has brilliantly come up with a story that is just so non-sensical and ridiculous that you can't help but to be caught up in it. What starts as a simple one night cheating session turns into one of the most complicated and twisted stories ever. It seems that the main character played by R. Kelly isn't the only one sleeping around. As each song comes to a close we find out there is yet another twist to look forward to in the next chapter of the song. And more and more people get involved into the never ending tale.

I'll admit it, flat out. I'm not a fan of R&B music or R. Kelly. But something drew me to this ""urban opera"" as Kelly proudly calls this that now makes me a fan of R. Kelly. This is something that I think someone from any background or origin can get into. It is almost like watching the WWE or a soap opera in the morning just with a musical theme to it. And the music is actually fun. While the song comes off more like speaking to a tune with a rhyme to it, it has a great beat and sound to it that keeps everything flowing well together in each chapter. And you can't take it seriously. Of course the events that go on in each chapter are silly and far fetched. He touches on a little bit of everything. Cheating, gay couples, dwarfs, convicts, nosey neighbors, his great impression of a white southern house wife and even the crooked cop shows up. You name it and it shows up in these videos. There are some part that are laugh out loud funny while other parts that just make you wonder where he came up with some of this as it is so forced and strange to suddenly be showing up. But they don't try to be a serious take on urban life, it is more of a mocumentary of just weird occurances. Anyone taking this too seriously shouldn't be watching this as that is not at all what this is trying to portray. If anything it seems like its just having fun through music and corny situations and it's a very unique and fun experience for the most part.

If it weren't for the silliness and just drawn out situations that this gets into as we get deeper into the story this would easily be a five star recomendation. But that's not to say that this is not worth checking out and owning. I think anyone who likes some good music, some fun situations and something you will definitely watch more then once, you can't go wrong here. There is a reason why this has been spoofed and referenced in so many places. Its just that original and fresh and unique an idea that R. Kelly came up with here, that it is hard not to get addicted to these videos and the music as well. I won't say this deserves an award or anything for great music and acting but I will say I was very pleasently surprised when I saw it for myself. R. Kelly in his own way has come up with something here and I say don't judge it till you see it. Whether you cringe, laugh or get into the music, you will find something to enjoy with his Urban Opera. I know I sure did.",1176163200,2,3124,4.151815181518152
2417352,5,B000BI5MQI,"Watching ""Trapped in the Closet"" is exactly like watching a car accident.  Specifically, a short bus has run a travelling carnival off the road, and now there's a riot.

2417354,4,B000BI5MQI,"After hearing the first five ""chapters"" in this musical soap opera, I thought I was prepared for the music videos that followed the ""saga"" up to its twelfth chapter. No. Nothing can prepare you for what R. Kelly has created in the first twelve chapters of Trapped in the Closet.

Whether you take these stories seriously (as R. Kelly does), or as a monumental joke (as I do), they're definitely original and unforgettable. Masterfully mixing soap opera, musical comedy, R & B, farce, and even a little old school musical into one big pot of lip-synced sweetness, Trapped in the Closet will have you engrossed in the story, and laughing at every plot twist. I mean, there's a midget with asthma hiding in the pantry at one point.

The ""behind the scenes"" featurette offers insight into R. Kelly's creation. Behind the scenes he just keeps repeating how this is his masterpiece and it's going to change what people thing is ""possible and impossible"". In R. Kelly's mind, the future holds 20 more chapters and a Trapped in the Closet talk show. It's interesting to watch his child-like fascination with his own creation, but don't get caught up in his fanatacism, because Trapped in the Closet is a farcical masterpiece at best, not the work of genius he might make it out to be.",1169251200,4,1276,4.7174887892376685

2417356,1,B000BI5MQI,"One of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's very hard to believe that such self-parody is not the product of a comic genius. The best thing for R Kelly to do would be to pretend he was just kidding, that this was all a pastiche. He'd be hailed as the new Woody Allen.

Instead, it seems, Kelly believes this atrocious, childish hodgepodge of stereotypes and soapy cliches is his masterpiece.

How anyone can not laugh at the cherry pie, the whole midget/Bridget episode, the casual whipping out of guns at the slightest provocation, the intoned soulfulness of the most inane and banal lyrics, is beyond me.

2417369,2,B000BI5MQI,"R. Kelly has a great voice, but unfortunately has a horrible time with plot, acting, and rhyming.  Trapped in the Closet is downright terrible.  The plot holes are gaping.  Small children could fall into the plot holes, so watch out.  He also makes it seem that any married couple or serious relationship will end with infidelity and cheating of some kind, a sad comment from R. Kelly.  His characters are cartoonish, especially Brigette the white trash wife and Big Man the midget, and it seems that no one is happy.  However, this movie is worth a viewing.

Why?  Because it's so bad it has to be watched.  This will go down in college dorms as the movie everyone has seen because it's just that terrible.  The best part, though, is the director's commentary.  As if R. Kelly hasn't made this movie rediculous enough, the director's commentary is him watching the movie with us and explaining the plot to us as though we were not watching it and we had never seen it before.  Below are just some of the gems R. Kelly comes up with during the commentary, all of which help us to further understand this movie:

""How many people come home from prison and -- my goodness!-- get shot?""

""That's the cliffhanger, the fact that it wasn't a cliffhanger.""

""James loves pears and honey.""

""For a slice to be missing makes you wonder because she's allergic to cherries.  It's a cliff hanger!""

""Big man has a lot of cliff hangers going on with his character.""

""It's a global closet thing.""

""It's almost like the Ghost of Christmas here.""

Yep, R. Kelly said all these things in the commentary.  And many more.  So, this is no masterpiece.  But do watch it, because it's  so bad it has to be good.",1142640000,,1691,4.538205980066445

Ladies and gentlemen, this DVD might be the most craptacular thing ever produced.  So why the 5 star rating?  Because it's also one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life!

It's stereotypical to the point of being slapstick (non-stop sex and violence count as physical comedy, right?), and the music is TERRIBLE.  All chapters are set to the same background music, which sounds like a synthesizer drum beat followed by a goofy dripping noise.  And then the lyrics...well, just imagine a typical generic R&B woo-woo song with lyrics about midgets, gay ministers, cherry pie and a whole array of other laughable topics.  You get the picture.

So, in conclusion, don't buy Trapped in the Closet unless you love to laugh at things that aren't necessarily meant to be funny.  If you're the kind of person who watches bad horror movies and R&B videos purely for the comedic value, then this is right up your alley.",1140480000,6,1097,4.701570680628272

And then...I saw it. I saw this half completed musical motion picture of accidental genius and the unlikeliest perfection. Everyone who saw it with me agreed- everyone being PhDs and JDs that discuss spinoza and the economics of asian population growth for fun- we all thought this was totally mind blowing and exceeded all expectations.

From the moment it starts, the story is completely gripping. You want to hear every rhyme and every last word of every petty fight and every seemingly tangential detail. There is no character development, no naturalistic build up- its pure extreme plot action layered on top of each other. No matter how many people R Kelly pulls his ""baretta"" at, it never gets old. Every step of the build up to the next revelation is total intensity in itself.  Gun shots firing, death threats, admissions of infedelity all sung to a point of climactic slience...and then it begins again...and again...and you never want it to end.

Yes, it is hilarious. Yes, it is unreal, surreal, wondrous and non linear and horrofically one dimensional all at the same time.

Does R Kelly know it comes off as rediculous and stupid? He seems to take it seriously, but then he did write in his badly mimicked southern accent of Bridgette, her feigned obsession with pears and her love for a midget stowed away in her cabinet. Did Kelly really think people could get through that absurdity without laughing?

2417386,1,B000BI5MQI,"Simply, put, this is one of the worst and most offensive things I've seen in my entire life.  Kelly plays into every stereotype and stereotypical situation imaginable while giving none of the realism or depth or complexity necessary for it to succeed as a drama and none of the self-awareness that might make it succeed as a comedy.  The writing, from a plot standpoint, is about the worst I have ever seen.

The writing, from a musical standpoint, is about the worst I have ever seen.  As often as not, Kelly gives up on even rhyming, which might have almost saved the lack of any content whatsoever.

My biggest problem, though, has to with the music itself.  Namely, there isn't any.  A single loop runs without any relief through the entire 45 minutes of the movie, and Kelly keeps singing the same 4 or 5 notes the entire time.  It's physically exhausting to hear the same frequencies without any variation whatsoever for the better part of an hour.  A chapter ends, the music goes to silence, then starts back up again with exactly the same loop.  Most full-length musicals have between ten and thirty fully-realized songs.  ""Trapped in the Closet"" doesn't even have one.  Would you pay money to see a musical play that only had a single three-second riff repeated for two acts?  Would you buy a CD that only had one three-second riff repeated for an hour?  Why Kelly thinks you'll do so for him is outrageous and no short of an offense to the music industry and to music fans.",1137110400,8,1483,4.5893536121673

It's just genius how the story keeps you on the edge of your wet seat as you watch the plot thicken.  The best part is that you don't have to be smart to figure out what is happening, because every detail is described with R. Kelly's beautiful vocals.  And if you have been so fortunate as to have seen the T.V. version, you know that it's narrated again by R. Kelly just in case you're really dumb.  How cool is that!?

Not only are we treated with the exact same plot twist over and over and over with only two very, very minor variations, not only are the lyrics lame and  uninspired, sometimes rhyming, sometimes not, having no attention payed to meter in the least, but it's poorly acted and choreographed. Terrible blue screen only adds to the complete lack of sense and coherence in this piece.

That said, I don't think I've laughed harder in a long time. The situations, the lyrics, the acting, the blue screen, the ridiculous behavior, it's too much to bear. Me and my friends were almost crying from the hillarity of it all.

In fact, we were all so blown away with how bad it was, we began to postulate that perhaps this was intentional, perhaps it was all meant as a wonderful, self depricating joke. Watch the ""remix"" (essentially a comentary only you get to watch Kelly not say anything useful as he watches the movie) and you'll find out how un-ironic, how truly misguided, foolish, simple and flat out dumb Kelly really is. Oh well, brilliant self satire was never something I had high hopes about for him.

If you're looking for a laugh at a terrible, terrible movie, borrow this from a friend or check it out from a library.

Imagine the lowest level plot and script writing possible, combined with a repeating song that is also at the lowest level of what r& b/soul has the potential to be, and add to that acting and action that are so unbelievably cheesy and insulting to one's basic, basic, basic level of intelligence that it is outright hilarious. I mean it! This should really be marketed as a comedy, because it is outright GENIUS if you look at it that way. I have never laughed so hard in years. If you want to see the depths that R. Kelly can dig down in to, check out this video, and prepare for a true comedy classic.

I find it hard to believe that anyone considers this a work of genius...it is comedy at it's greatest, parody at it's fullest, and horrifyingly bad lyric and plot writing at it's worst. The only redeeming quality is that R. Kelly seems to take it very seriously, which provides laughs like you may have not experienced before.

Just watch it.  Just do whatever it is that you need to do to witness R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet.  The problem with most articles and reviews online, such as those here at Amazon or at Rolling Stone, is that they give you too much.  For a work such as this, spoilers are unforgivable.  The psychotically insane genius of TitC relies partly on surprising the viewer with its confounding plot revelations.  Beyond that, however, there is simply Kellz' beautiful (sometimes so in spite of the subject matter) vocal performance.  In fact, in many ways it is the incongruity of the angelic beauty of the vocal performance with the STUPID plot twists and ghetto dialogue that really makes TitC worth watching and discussing.  Otherwise it would just be a rambling, repulsive joke.  As it stands, it is a rambling and repulsive might-or-might-not-be joke that sticks in your head and puts your jaw on the floor.  The thing that really keeps me intrigued is contemplating R. Kelly's actual intent with this piece.  It is absurd beyond anything anyone could have predicted, but there remains ambiguity about whether or not he intended it to be a joke.  Whether he did or whether he didn't, however, the fact of the matter is that TitC is unlike any piece ever produced in popular music history.  R. Kelly has succeeded in doing something so boldly unconventional that the question of his sanity is finally put to rest:  R. Kelly has lost his mind, and he has enough money and notoriety to share it with all of you out there in TV Land.

Although he has been convicted of no crime, there is a great deal of likelihood that R. Kelly is indeed a sex offender and a pervert in just about the most negative sense of the word.  My reverence for TitC does not condone the actions of the deranged mind behind the work; however, I also do not believe that those actions diminish the importance of the work in the historied cannon of pop music.  Most people--let alone most musicians--in their lifetimes could never hope to produce something this astonishing, and by astonishing, I mean completely f****** retardedly insane.",1134950400,18,2292,4.71859296482412

They must be pretty sucessful by turning something ""bad"" into ""good"". It's marketing savvy and knowing your audience. Kelly's video reminds me of the ""Bronze Thrills"" magazines that were sold in the hood back in the day with same kind of lurid, ludicrous stories.

Kelly knows he's basically a smut merchant and makes no apologies. He even calls himself ""The Pied Piper of R&B"" in one of his videos.

Even the cover art of ""T in the C"" cracks me up because of the serious look, because Kelly knows his intended audience (ghetto folks) will probably take it seriously.",1133913600,2,705,4.723577235772358
2417407,5,B000BI5MQI,"Trapped in the Closet is a a work of unadulterated, if perhaps unintentional, genius which rests comfortably alongside the work of

Bunuel and Dali.  What begins as a stereotypical melodrama quickly escalates into an epic farce which gleefully subverts our conception of what is possible and impossible.  Lines like ""he's opening the dresser / I pull out my berreta"" and ""then the midget takes his inhaler out"" elevate R. Kelly's meisterwerk into storytelling genius.  The subtle touches, like the fact that the midget has asthma, or that the Cop's wife is allergic to cherry pie, are like the details in a Bosch, giving life to the hellscape of modern life and revealing to us, in an age when we find ourselves drawn increasingly apart, that we are all connected in ways which may never be revealed to us, until we are forced into the closet by the unexpected arrival of a one night stand's spouse.  R. Kelly's narrative interludes, delivered from inside the closet, remind us of the intent of the artist in orchestrating events, and casts R. Kelly into the mold of a sympathetic but ultimately helpless creator.  By revealing to the audience both his control over evetns and his ultimate helplessness, he reminds us strikingly of Humbert Humbert in his asides to the jury.

Also, the most important thing to remember while watching is that R. Kelly peed on a 14 year old girl.",1133827200,326,1378,4.813559322033898
2417408,4,B000BI5MQI,"I am quite surprised at the other reviews of this video, because I found it compelling. Now I don't think we should be judging this movies by the same standards that we judge Hollywood movies. This video is more like 12 music videos that are meant to be watched back to back. And the fact that it is like one long song does not diminish how catchy it is. I can still hear that rhythm in my head. There are no big name actors, there is no big-name budget. In fact, some of the acting is lousy, and I was surprised that R Kelly is as ugly as he is (I never saw any of his videos before), but I have to say that I found the story riveting. Now I don't watch soap operas, so I have no idea idea how much this plot resembles one of those, but I think the distinction between a soap opera and Anna Karenina is a relative one, the distinction between low art and high art being more arbitrary than we would care to admit. I am not saying this is Tolstoy or a work of art, but for popular culture this is at least as good as any of the crap that Hollywood shovels down our throats and charges us (...)to and two hours of our lives to have to sit through. I give this one two thumbs up. For what it is, I think it is a success. And I like it too. I can't wait for the rest of the story!",1133827200,6,1277,3.896551724137931

It sounds like it was all written in one evening.  Even if it is supposed to be funny (like some other reviews say), it's not very clever.  R Kelly used to have a shred of admiration from me, but not anymore.  What's up with that echo at the end of every chapter?  Really, it just makes me laugh.

This production deserves five stars for its sheer horribleness.  It's a classic that deserves to be watched again and again!  The message needs to get out about this terrible urban opera, so that all can appreciate it for its utter hilarity.

2417414,4,B000BI5MQI,"R. Kelly, or ""Kells"", has stated innumerable times that Trapped In The Closet will be something for the ages--something that will be appreciated for ""twenty years"".  Why he puts the limiter of twenty years on it, I can't possibly fathom, but twenty years it is.  I, for one, must agree with him.

Trapped In The Closet is the most peculiar and enjoyable musical experiment I've seen since Shock Treatment, or perhaps Streets of Fire.  But where Shock Treatment was camp, and Streets of Fire was bombastic, Trapped In The Closet is absolute insanity.

In supposedly basing his story on ""reality,"" we get a closer look into Kells' psyche--and a scary look it is.  In his opinion, it's compeletely normal for people to pull out a gun at the slightest provocation (e.g., being offered pears too many times).  Guns are also not all that dangerous (regard his head-scratching with his Beretta, and also the extremely bloody but ultimately immaterial wound his brother-in-law receives).  Everyone in R. Kelly's world cheats (even midgets).

What makes this so much fun is the extreme level of detail he provides.  Conversations are sung almost verbatim as they may occur.  Consider this exchange between R. and his wife:  ""Remember my friend Tina?"" ""Yeah, I think so, I might know her if I seen her.""  ""Well she's got this friend, Roxanne.""  ""Who the hell is Roxanne?""  ""She's friends with this dude Rufus, and he's cool with Chuck.""  And it goes on and on.  Another classic line:  ""He says yes, I say no, he says yes, I say no.""  Aw heck, another favorite:  ""I say ba-, she say Shuddup.""

There is so much that's bizarre about this.  The unrated version is inexplicably intermittently censored, but rather than a beep sound, it's R. Kelly going ""doot"" in tune with the music.  For that matter, Kells also adds sound effects himself such as ""brrriiing"" for a telephone.

The story, such as it is, is a continuous re-iteration of the same theme.  This works perfectly with the music, which is also a continuous re-iteration of the same song.  Admittedly, the tune is quite enjoyable; somewhat of a surprise after listening to a bit of TP3 Reloaded.

But the story doesn't really matter.  It's how R. Kelly tells this bizarre story that obviously has no ending that makes Trapped in the Closet ""Trapped In The Closet.""  How do I know this?  Because he tells us so in the commentary.

The commentary is a gem of self-aggrandizing self-love.  In a clever bit of egotism, he is visible in a chair watching the movie, so it's almost like we're watching the movie with him.  The problem is that that's exactly what happens.  He's so enraptured by the film that he can barely pull his eyes away to give us commentary.  And when he does, the commentary is usually explaining the story which is so simple as to be understandable to puppies.  Either that, or he tells us what's great about Trapped In The Closet.  As another reviewer pointed out, did you know it rhymes?  Did you know it has cliffhangers?  And that the things that aren't cliffhangers are actually cliffhangers in reverse?  Occasionally, he is delightfully brought off-track by the presence of himself in the movie.  Sentences peter out when he sees R. Kelly on the screen and he settles back into his chair blissfully.

I have to give him credit, though.  I will certainly be enjoying Trapped In The Closet for not only twenty more years, but hopefully for the rest of my life.  It's up there with Plan 9, Star Crash, Starship Invasions, and Michael Jackson's horrific Moonwalker as some of the classically bad entertainment ever made.  And like all of those film greats, it brilliantly skirts unwatchable awfulness to become a completely and thoroughly enjoyable experience.

Note to R. Kelly:  If you read this, and are writing more, please do not try to make this any sillier than it already is.  Stick to your guns, and continue making Important Art.  I fear that if you try to turn this into camp, you will lose the magic that makes Trapped In The Closet so completely wonderful.  You are, indeed, da man.",1132531200,31,4060,4.7464183381088825
2417415,5,B000BI5MQI,"R. Kelly did a great job with Trapped in the Closet 1-12. Anybody readiing these reviews, please pay no attention to the comments about 'Trapped' being ridiculous and stupid. It's apparent that they all just have something against R. Kelly because if you didn't like chapters 1-5 why did you purchase 1-12? I am R. Kelly's number one fan and I didn't really care for chapters 1-5 at first (honestly), but it grew on me. Chapter 6-12 is hilarious and it is well worth the 13.99 I paid for it. I can't wait for the other chapter's to come out.

At least he is not as ignorant as these stupid rappers out here, making a fool out of themselves, putting they non-acting selves in these stupid movies - but yall running to the movies to go see that mess! We couldn't pay yall to say something negative about that crap that needs to be dissed. R. Kelly is not trynna be serious with the darn DVD or trying to make a career change, he is just doing something different. If you watch the commentary part of it, he is laughing himself. I bet everyone who made a negative comment about this DVD went to see that ignorant 50 cent movie and love it. But anyway, it is hilarious! For the real R. Kelly fans (I REPEAT, THE REAL R.

If R Kelly is actually taking himself seriously and thinks he's a genius for creating serious drama or whatever he wants to call it, he needs his head examined. If on the other hand he was trying to create some of the best comedy ever, he couldn't have done better. Midgets? Bridegett's alergic to cherries?

To take one melodic verse and stretch it to a ridiculous 40 minute sing-song story is quite a feat.  And let me tell you...it all rhymes.  In case you didn't pick up on that, R. himself spills that secret in the commentary.  This is probably my favorite part of the DVD because he gives a play-by-play for the story which he's ALREADY singing during the song.  Also dudes, count the number of times he uses the word ""cliffhanger"" in the commentary.  R.

I don't buy his albums either. I was put on to this video after watching ""Trapped in the Cupboard"" on Mad TV with my girl. After watching the videos, I have to admit that this is one of the most innovative things to happen in music this year. For the fools out there criticizing, this video is not meant be Oscar material (idiots) and is not on par with great dramas. You realize that right away! It's supposed to be outrageous and that's what keeps you watching every episode of this video. With the current state of stagnation in urban music, new ideas should be welcomed and not hated on. This is on par with MTV's hip-hopera ""Carmen"" with Mos-Def and Beyonce. Not Oscar material, but new and innovative.

But in this instance I have to say something. This is one of the most obnoxious, silly, & just humiliating music related projects I've seen in sometime.  Not just for R.Kelly, but for RnB fans, & African-Americans in general.

R.Kelly tells a story of how he somehow ends up in some woman's bed after a night at the club, like he somehow didn't have conscious knowledge of what he did the night before.  And basically the story spirals (and is still spiralling) into a nonsensical ""lover's who cheat tale"", bringing along every black stereotype: the post J.L. King era ""downlow"" lover, the wounded girlfriend who cheats to get back at her man, the self-righteous I-did-wrong-but-girl-I-still-love-you man who R.Kelly plays very well.

I just reviewed this because I think that at one point R.Kelly was a reasonably talented producer with okay songs, but through the years has de-evolved into another typical black male stereotype with very mediocre music to match.  Oh, ""I'm so churchful, yet such a player"" syndrome got very tired, very quick!

As an African-American male, this sickens me, & angers me that RnB is portrayed this way & that blacks are portrayed in such a way.

""I want to punch you.""

We may actually have something more wretched than Prince's excruciating vanity movie, UNDER THE CHERRY MOON.  I honestly didn't think I was going to live to see that monument toppled...but here we are.

Just as I was baffled by the ""song"" or ""story"" or whatever the heck TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET really is, I'm also just as confused by the 5-star reviews.  They can't be serious, can they?

This is a joke, right?  ""Urban Opera""?  More like hip-hop scam.  There is more character development watching Benny Hill chase girls in fast-motion in their underwear than what's here.  Everyone is cheating on everyone else at such absurd levels, I was hoping for an alien attack and rectal probes all around.  All characters are pretty much despicable.
