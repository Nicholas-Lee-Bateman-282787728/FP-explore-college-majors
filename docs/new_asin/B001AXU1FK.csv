3473580,5,B001AXU1FK,"THis video is HILARIOUS!  If you're a fan of Brian Regan (and if you aren't, you should be!) you will LOVE this DVD!",1227398400,,116,4.043478260869565
3473581,5,B001AXU1FK,"What can you say about Brian Regan??? His facial expressions & body movements are timeless. He can be viewed by the entire family without fear of hearing anything that may not be appropriate for younger or sensitive individuals. This is (as far as I know) his third dvd. His other ones ""Standing up"" (easily found) & ""I walked on the moon"" are great also.""I walked..."" dvd I found through his website. Was worth it to do so as I love all 3 dvd's :) in closing...if you enjoy any of his dvd's you will want all of them!",1226534400,,518,4.295918367346939
3473582,5,B001AXU1FK,"For those of you that know Brian Regan's work, you've probably already purchased and watched this video.  For those of you who haven't seen him or heard him, he is an absolutely hilarious, highly animated comic that takes a simple look at life and reveals the obsurdity in it.  His facial expressions are perfectly timed with his humor and truly show a wonderful comedian. Brian is a thinking man's comic...meaning he is very intelligent in his humor and observations of life.

I give this review 5 stars because Brian's a fanstastic comedian who deserves more aclaim and, next to Jim Gaffigan, is my favorite comedian.  The one downside to this DVD is its length.  It feels pretty short.  While this is a great concert video to introduce you to Brian Regan, I would recommend his ""I Walked On The Moon"" DVD for your first.  But what am I saying...go ahead and get both of them at the same time.  You won't be disappointed.",1223856000,,923,4.619631901840491
3473583,5,B001AXU1FK,"Brian Regan is by far one of the greatest comic minds of present day, and what I love most about him is that he can be totally hilarious and at the same time clean enough to let your whole family enjoy. I've bought all of Brian's DVD's thus far and I just love the guy. Wholeheartedly applaud this one too. After his second DVD, I thought that his funnier days were in the past, but his new material is every bit as hilarious as his first stuff (""The big yellow one is the sun!"", ""You too!"", etc.). Buy it! Heck, buy 5 of 'em and give them as Christmas or birthday gifts! He's that good!!",1222992000,,588,4.121739130434783
3473584,2,B001AXU1FK,"i love brian regan stand up, the guy is seriously funny, but this is like 45 minutes of his mediocre material, it's not bad but it's not nearly as funny as any of his other specials, get ""i walked on the moon"" or his last comedy central special if you want some great regan stuff",1222646400,2,279,4.090909090909091
3473585,4,B001AXU1FK,"Brian Regan's comedy routines are generally clean and very funny for the most part. This, his 3rd DVD, is a great performance, though it's not as good as his previous releases. There are some genuinely funny routines (the ""JFK ride"", intelligent life on Neptune), but many are not quite there. It's also sad to see him starting to include more profanity in his act. We're not talking ""Chris Rock"" here (he only says ""What the h-"" about 8 times), but if you compare this to his CD, it's a lot, which is a shame because he has always been this really clean comedian.

The performance is 42 minutes long. If you saw it on Comedy Central there's really no reason to buy this as the only extras are a 3 1/2 minute encore where he does a couple of old bits, and a behind-the-scenes shoot. It doesn't warrant a purchase, unlike his last CC DVD which had extra performance material.

If you didn't see this on TV and own his last 2 DVDs and his CD, you'll still want to pick this up. There are no repeats from other releases (besides the audience-request encore), so it's a nice addition.",1221264000,3,1080,4.422110552763819
3473586,4,B001AXU1FK,"I agree with the earlier comment that this is the weaker of Brian's three DVD releases. But all things are relative - and this is still a very enjoyable, though brief, performance. If I had greater expectations, it was because I just saw Brian perform live a week ago -- and he has a lot of hilarious new material that did not appear in this DVD (all the more reason to catch his live show if you can!).
Brian's warm, average-joe delivery style is what makes him so likeable. His observations on everyday life are keen and hilarious. Brian's topics on this DVD include: realistic cooking shows (""Tune in tomorrow when after 45 minutes of preparation, I realized I don't have any eggs"", Pluto getting kicked out of the group of planets (""You're no longer a planet. The best we can figure is, you're just a big nothing""), walking up to strangers at parties (""I don't know what you're talking about. May I still stand here?""), the crimes of manslaughter versus loitering, game show contestants, etc.

At 40 minutes in length - with just 4 minutes of encore - this DVD is much too short. I'm waiting to see the other half of his show that was edited out on this DVD. But, it's still a fun 40 minutes.",1221004800,10,1196,4.461187214611872
3473587,5,B001AXU1FK,"After watching Regan's last Comedy Central special, I was hesitant to watch this performance. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the surplus of intelligent observations. Coupled with his hilarious expressions and upbeat personality, this special was highly entertaining.
And he pronounced every word correctly. Mostly.",1220918400,2,322,6.177777777777778
3473588,5,B001AXU1FK,"Just finished this DVD and we all enjoyed it very much. I still rank his first ""I walked on the moon"" as the best...and probably his second ""standing up"" slightly over this as it does have a 30 minute special as a bonus feature as well as encores.  The Epitome Of Hyperbole is not a bad third place but at a scant 42 minutes seems to end waaaay too  early.  The bonus encore is also very brief (about 4 minutes) and the making of is fun but not really something you want to watch again and again.  So...most of my complaining is that I want more of this guy....he's just that good, original and works clean (which I don't demand but he is different by that mere fact).

Brian's expressions and physical humor is almost as funny as his stories and bits..which I don't want to give away...but lets just say that if you own the other two DVDs ....there isn't overlap of bits...so ...bottom line..you really need ALL THREE!  his first one is available on his site...is an hour of gut busting stories from the classic ""Say 8"" to the title track.

I've seen him in concert and we just got tickets to see him in October...he is worth it live or on DVD...and his reputation and drawing power is completely due to word of mouth and talent....NOT the hype of NON funny ""celebs"" like Dane Cook....

Highly Recommended....!!!",1220140800,42,1313,4.441666666666666

He has a goofy manner and some silly physical moves that seemed dopey to me at first ... but once you watch enough of him you realize that's a cover for a very intelligent wit and some clever social commentary.

And this is coming from a guy who prefers raunchy, foul-mouthed, politically and socially incorrect comedy. The more politically incorrect the better! My girlfriend and I laugh for hours when we watch his standup routines. And audio only does not do him justice. You have to WATCH his routine. His zany facial expressions, body language and mannerisms sell the jokes. Similar to old school George Carlin, Steve Martin, Sam Kinison or even Jim Carey back in the day. He's very animated on the stage and often has to fight off laughing at his own jokes. A must watch.

It's good natured fun and laughter is good for your health. Watching this is the equivalent of ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"".  Grab an apple while you watch this bit of silliness!

And reflecting back on it, I don't recall any profanity whatsoever, which itself is an achievement.  Regan ranges across many topics, and I would say that one of his most distinctive strengths is his use of body language and facial expressions.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes stand-up comedy.",1301961600,,434,4.76

He makes every day things we all experience into something extremely hilarious.,1293840000,,314,4.431034482758621
3473817,4,B001AXU1FK,"I enjoy Brian Regan's brand of humor, and will be seeing him in February. I recently watched this episode as thought it was hilarious, but Standing Up might be a little better. His comedy routine is mostly based on his physical demeanor and facial expressions, and his material covers much of what we think of as ordinary life stuff, but he can take this and make it funny with his goofiness. The Epitome of Hyperbole has some bits that are funnier than others, but overall most of the material was funny. Unlike most comedians, Brian Regan I can watch over and over. Some of the subjects he uses: learning to read, being smart, lazy writing, mingling at parties, judging art, crimes, jury duty, intelligent life on other planets, the differences between men and women.

One of the funniest parts is when he is talking about crimes, comparing loitering to manslaughter. ""Is something really a crime when it's remedied as easily as `all right, move along'?""

""What are you in for?""
""Loitering. I'm like you. I live on the edge!""

Another funny segment is him talking about jury duty selection, and how the process to get out of it becomes like a game show.

It's nice to hear a comedian who doesn't have to use the ""f"" word to get laughs. Brian Regan talks about the every day, but has fun doing it, and makes for an enjoyable time watching.",1293753600,,1340,4.594142259414226

I saw his show in which he did a lot of this material, and it's amazing to me how he reproduces the jokes in the EXACT same manner.  I guess when you tour and do a show every night, it becomes second nature...  Anyway, there aren't really any slow points, and each joke flows from the previous.  IMO, it's slightly less funny than ""Standing Up"" or ""I Walked on the Moon"", but still great stuff!  Keep it up Brian!",1285718400,,478,4.386363636363637

His expressions are what make his jokes all that much funnier.  He talks about how stupid and clueless he is about life and i can completely relate to him lol.  If youve never heard him before check this one out, its not his best one but its still very funny and a lot better than some of the other comedians out there.  The dvd is better than the cd obviously bc sometimes to really get the most out of the joke you have to see the way he acts, its hilarious.

3473822,4,B001AXU1FK,"I have seen Brian Regan live and seen his DVD's several times. Brian is always excellent at observational humor, and has the physical gestures and delivery needed to make the jokes work perfectly. Although I think this is not Brian's best DVD, it's still worth seeing (several times). I especially liked the routines about approaching strangers at parties and about Pluto's removal from the list of planets.

I was on the fence for rating this DVD. The performance warrants a five star rating, but the show is only 42 minutes long, and the encore is much shorter than his standard (it's only four minutes long, and isn't especially strong, but was essentially an ""audience request"" format). ""The Backstage Story"" is interesting, and gives a lot of information of how a show of this scale is made, and I recommend watching it. I settled on four stars because there are better and longer Regan shows on DVD (I'm especially fond of ""Standing Up"").

Brian Regan is one of the funniest (and cleanest) comedians working today, and I highly recommend all his material, and especially recommend catching his live act if you are able to.",1279756800,6,1128,4.839378238341969

He even got a little razzled when someone from the audience chimed in - it completely threw him off his game for a couple of minutes.  You'd think if you're a stand-up you'd be able to take some audience participation, but he couldn't handle it.

I've seen one other special of his, and that one had more balance and some good stories.  This special on the other hand, was contriving one scenario after another which gave him an excuse to make that same face over and over again.  It just wasn't good.  Making a funny face can add to your special, but the special shouldn't revolve around you making a funny face.",1255305600,,660,4.458333333333333

This, the astude film noir buff will know, is a take-off on a line of Sideny Falco
as played by Tony Curtis in ""Sweet Smell of Success.""
  I discovered Brian at the Improv in D.C. many, many years ago. I couldn't believe how funny he was. Every time he played that club, I went and took friends.
In addition to enjoying Brian again and again, I liked observing just how quickly he got people to laughing with tears rolling down their cheeks -- usually in under two minutes. Amazing!
  If you compare, as some commenters have, this DVD program to previous ones, OK,
it may not be up to that level. BUT...if you compare Brian to the foul-mouthed, put-down, nothing-sacred comics out there, he is a refreshing feast of entertainment.

I have watched this DVD with family roughly nine times now and it never gets old.  I find myself giddily anticipating the jokes as he starts each new subject.  It's a favorite of ours when we have company, as it translates well to young and old viewers alike.  Everyone loves his materal and invariably they all end up asking, ""So, wait, what's this guy's name again?  He's hilarious!  I have to tell so-and-so - they'd love this!""

  He just isn't selling the jokes.

  Perhaps he wasn't feeling well or maybe he just didn't know the material backwards and forwards, to the point where he could concentrate on the delivery. Whatever the cause, the material is delivered at a slow pace, in often hushed tones, and with long pauses. Going back and listening to past efforts, it is clear that it was his energy and excited delivery that drove the absurdity of his observational humor all the way to the edge of insanity. Which is exactly why it left us in stitches and barely able to breathe.

  Was Brian depressed? Distracted? Living in laid back California for too long? No matter. Just pour Brian a couple of strong cups of coffee before the show next time and give our friend another go.",1247875200,,1000,4.5418994413407825

His facial expressions are priceless!  We took his DVD's over to our parent's house, and they absolutely loved him.  My brother even let his pastor watch his DVD, and he loved him, too!

And there isn't much on the dvd that you didn't see on the aired version except for a couple extended jokes and the very brief encore. All in all I'm still quite happy for picking it up because Brian Regan is a fantastic comedian and well worth checking out.",1237852800,,559,4.045045045045045
3473869,5,B001AXU1FK,"Brian Regan is the best comic out there.  In his act there is not a single swear word, curse word, or dirty joke, and he can make you laugh until you cry.

3473871,5,B001AXU1FK,Brian Regan is by far the funniest and cleanest comedian there is.  That's a rare combination.  He's even better live.  If you have the chance don't miss it.,1233187200,,157,4.535714285714286
3473872,5,B001AXU1FK,"Brian Regan is such an unusual comedian in our day: he's funny--really funny--and intelligent and clean. I'm sooooo sick of ""comedians"" who rely on f-bombs, potty humor and other way-not-funny material to get laughs.

3473874,5,B001AXU1FK,"Brian Regan is a true genuinely funny comedian. I'm not going to compare him to Dane Cook like everybody else seems to do. You'll read a lot how Brian uses clean humor and that is what gets him a lot of praise. It's true, the worst word I have ever heard him say is ""hell"" and it was once. He starts off getting you laughing within the first 30 seconds of watching and doesn't let up. His ""art"" bit is some of the funniest stuff you may see. I can't say things without giving away his jokes, you just need to watch it for yourself and see how truly funny this man is.",1231891200,,567,4.0265486725663715
