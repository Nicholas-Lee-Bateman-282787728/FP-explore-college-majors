Hopefully the English version on VHS will come around soon. It's about a young black man named Tommy (played by Darius McCrary) whose first day back out in society. Problems doesn't help matters much being down on his luck with no job and some old friends show up and talk about old times when things weren't so cool. Then Tommy meets a kindly Christian lady named Memaw (played by Irma P. Hall). Memaw takes Tommy into her own home and under her wing and helps him on the road to a better life. Tommy also meets Memaw's granddaughter, Lilly (played by Tamera Mowry). Lilly is shy of this stranger off the street at first, but their friendship grows. Memaw takes Tommy to church, there he learns about the Gospel of Christ, and that God forgives no matter what we've done. Memaw finds out the Tommy has a wonderful voice for singing and encourages him to join the church choir. He makes such waves with his singing, that everyone from all around the neighborhood come to hear him sing. A talent company asks Tommy to appear on TV. Things certainly have changed for Tommy. As the good book says, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

Tommy's old friends, G. Smooth and the gang resents Tommy's new found life and try talking him into getting back with the gang. Tommy tells them how the Lord saved him and straighten out his life. Tommy accepts the better side of the tracks. His closest friends feeling betrayed ends their friendship. Then one day Tommy's friend, G. Smooth is shot and while recovering in the hospital he sees Tommy on the TV singing. Tommy finds out that his injured friend's in the hospital and visits him. There Tommy tells his friend about Jesus and that he gave him a chance to know him. At first it's hard to swallow but in the end G. Smooth comes around. The film is delightful and has a special appearance of Grammy winner Kirk Franklin. There's lots of music, singing and shouting. It's a wonderful story with a equally blessed message that will have everyone something to sing about!",1061424000,,2183,4.58312020460358
