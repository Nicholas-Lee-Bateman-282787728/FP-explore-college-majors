3897580,5,B002BWP2JO,"Our crooks, catching up after six months of apartness:

- Parker: ""I stole the Hope Diamond, and then I put it back.""
- Hardison: ""I spent three days hacking the White House email.... No buzz, but we are doing some pretty hinky stuff in Pakistan. Hiiiinky.""
- Sophie: ""Look, I'm miserable. They're miserable."" (looks at Eliot) ""Okay, what have you been doing the last six months?""
- Eliot: ""I was in Pakistan.""

With LEVERAGE and WHITE COLLAR doing pretty well on cable TV, it's safe to say that the Nielsens and we just plain love our fast-talking anti-heroes, just plain relish the art of the con. We should've known that last season's demolition of their headquarters wouldn't be enough to thwart our well-meaning, not-quite-reformed bunch of scoundrels from exerting their brand of ""leverage"" on them what deserves it. LEVERAGE's second season opens up with Nathan Ford's crew disassembled now for six months and scattered to the winds. Nate Ford himself has given up the liquor, although he's still mighty tempted. But a chance reunion and a case of a victimized father and daughter motivate the gang for one last con. Except we know it's not really the last con.

Nathan Ford's new base of operations is now in Boston, and maybe it's a bit ironic that his loft apartment/headquarters sits over an Irish bar, and that this bar is where Nathan tends to screen potential clients (this doesn't seem too smart to me but whatever). As ever Nathan, a recovering lush and still very much broken, gets the lion's share in character development, with the show taking its sweet time in disclosing backstories on his crew. We already know that Parker is the quirky thief and a social mine field, that Eliot is the strong and silent muscle, and that Hardison is the gabby computer tech. For the most part, that's still all we know about them; they continue to be, er, sketchy characters. Sophie Deveraux, sometime horrendous actress, sometime grifter, fares better, is written with added layers. But the potential romance between her and Nate is put on hold (matter of fact, the potential romance between Parker and Hardison is also fairly nonexistent now). Season 2 can be split into two halves: with Sophie and then without.

SPOILER alert for the next two paragraphs (although by now I think everyone knows about the following):

During her six months away from the Leverage team, Sophie had gotten herself a boyfriend, and this somehow leads to her raising angsty questions regarding her true self, blah blah blah. And then real life intrudes when Gina Bellman - the actress who plays Sophie - gets preggers and has to go on a pseudo-sabbatical. Her leavetaking is written in the show as Sophie taking a leave of absence to go ""find herself."" Off they go - Gina and Sophie - and this paves the way for Jeri Ryan.

Sophie, not wanting to leave her team in the lurch, introduces Tara Cole (Ryan), her friend and fellow scam artist. But Sophie's departure has fragmented the team. And, being new on the block and unproven, Tara only widens the divide. Sophie's always provided the emotional grounding for the team, and with her gone Nate, who so far had kept his s#i+ together, begins to show cracks. In these episodes Sophie's screen time is reduced to brief consultations on the phone as her teammates hit her up for advice. Each call to Sophie pretty much ends with ""Don't tell Nate I called."" Except that even Nate calls.

End SPOILERS.

There's always a lost soul in need of championing. Crooked corporations continue to merit the harsh application of Nate's leverage. Rotten bad guys still make the most gratifying marks. LEVERAGE keeps on being incredibly addictive. The twisty elaborate stings, from the planning stages to the execution, are sharply written. The show is wicked funny, the humor consistently inspired by the clashing character dynamics. And then there's that prevailing sense of cool. All these elements make for satisfying television. This season's more showy and fun episodes find our lovable rogues putting on a magic show (""The Top Hat Job""), planting a pandemic scare on a convicted felon (""The Order 23 Job""), bamboozling charlatan psychic Luke Perry (""The Future Job""), and even taking on a rival pack of grifters (""The Two Live Crew Job""). Season 2 culminates with a highly charged two-parter as the crew works to bring down a corrupt mayor. One fallout is that Eliot gets hooked playing professional baseball. And then Ford's old nemesis, smug insurance investigator James Sterling, resurfaces to make life miserable for everyone. Prep yourself for yet another of them surprising season finales.

The fifteen episodes comprising LEVERAGE Season 2 come in a 4-disc DVD set and has the following special features: The Creators of LEVERAGE in a Q & A at a special Los Angeles screening  of the Season 2 premiere (00:18:55 minutes); Co-creator/producer John Rogers gives a tour of the show's new sets (00:03:08); Behind the Boom featurette - the special effects behind two explosive scenes, including the Leverage headquarters getting blown up from Season One (00:07:14); ""The Hand Job"" spoof video - Aldis Hodges (""Hardison"") dispenses with some tips on how to hustle people (00:05:08); singer/songwriter/sound mixer Andy Lange's song ""Not Sure Yet"" is featured (00:02:58); the Season 2 Wrap Party Gag Reel (00:09:02); and informative audio commentaries by the creative team on each episode.

LEVERAGE, along with WHITE COLLAR and BURN NOTICE, are three of the coolest, strongest shows currently going on cable, each show featuring some very shady characters. But as one victimized young soul notes in ""The Beantown Bailout"": ""There are wolves in the world, but sometimes they're the good guys, I guess."" I'm so glad that LEVERAGE has been renewed. As Nate Ford might say, ""Let's go steal a third season.""",1275177600,,5829,4.974332648870637
3897581,5,B002BWP2JO,"One could say that the wonderful TNT series, ""Leverage: The Complete Second Season"", is living proof that Art Imitates Life, or something to that effect...not only did some of the episodes eerily echo actual machinations of a few world-class criminals, but one of the series' leads, wonderful Gina Bellman (grifter 'Sophie Devereaux') discovered she was pregnant as the season's first episode was filmed, necessitating some ""Leverage""-worthy 'sleight-of-hand' tricks to hide her expanding silhouette, and an eventual substitution by sexy Jeri Ryan, for the season's final arc of episodes (with Gina limiting her appearances to insure a safe childbirth) Ryan, while quite good, is NO Bellman, and I'm looking forward to Gina's return to regular duty in Season Three!

There were some exciting new developments, both in front of, and behind the camera, as a new 'home base' for the series was established, in Portland, Oregon (substituting for the ""Leverage"" team's home, in Boston, Massachusetts). Portland granted the production crew an amazing freedom to shoot wherever they chose, resulting in a 'look' more 'cinematic' than nearly any other television series. The characters 'grew', just as the locale did; Ford (Timothy Hutton) gets off of booze, but in a very self-destructive manner; Sophie realizes she's 'losing' herself to her cons, and searches for her own identity; Parker (Beth Riesgraf) continues to improve her very strange people skills; Hardison (Aldis Hodge) discovers he has no second-story criminal gifts; and more of the Moral Code of Eliot Spencer (Christian Kane) is revealed. And, of course, you can't have Ford at his best without major villains, so Mark Sheppard returns as ruthless Jim Sterling, as brilliant as our hero, but without a heart; and, in a VERY amusing episode, the evil version of the ""Leverage"" crew debuts, led by the fabulous Griffin Dunne. (I'm looking forward to seeing their return!) And, as with Season One, a Commentary by producers, director, and writers, is offered as a 'bonus' for every episode!

The ""Leverage"" Season finale is both visually stunning and emotionally overwhelming, and ranks, in my opinion, as an 'Instant Classic' moment for TNT...and stick around, because the last disc also offers very funny and insightful interviews, outtakes, and gags by cast and crew!

3897582,5,B002BWP2JO,"I love a good caper, great humor, excellent acting, and overall entertainment. I really like not being able to fully figure out an obvious plot.  This show keeps me on my toes.  Leverage has it all plus more, including the modern day Robin Hood feel. I think we can all enjoy the take from the rich (or bad guy) give to the poor (or good guy) fun this show gives its viewers.  It is a great escape from the work day.  So, just simply get some snacks, a drink of choice, slip in a DVD and have some good old fun!",1274918400,,511,4.02970297029703
3897583,5,B002BWP2JO,"I have seen reviewers compare this show to the caper shows of the late sixties and seventies, and caper would definitely be the way to describe the basic premise, but this show is so much more. It is complex, sophisticated, fast-paced and at times very funny. It is GREAT entertainment, pure and simple. The cast is first-rate, they work together flawlessly, and they all seem to have a natural affinity for their characters' skills.

The basic premise is a group of loners with well-honed skills - a grifter, a hacker, a ""hitter,"" and a thief - are brought together to do one job, and one job only, by former insurance claims investigator Nate Ford, the inimitable Timothy Hutton. In the course of the con, these very separate and very eccentric people start to learn to work together to accomplish a goal other than to fill their own pockets or fulfill their own needs. Those in the group who were not previously ""con"" artists per se get completely hooked on the game. People who have been victims of the greedy and powerful start to hear about Nate's team and come in search of justice. Despite several attempts at, and forced separations, the team also starts to get hooked on working with each other, and they get hooked on doing good. Ultimately, they are compelled to keep coming back for more.

The writing is impeccable, obviously well researched, and some of the best on television today. Amidst a plethora of ridiculous and downright repulsive ""reality"" shows, Leverage is a real breath of fresh air. May it go on for many seasons to come. I will buy them all! Thank you, TNT!",1272499200,9,1587,4.684587813620071
3897584,5,B002BWP2JO,"Leverage is back and better than ever with 15 fast paced, innovative, quirky episodes. Season 2 starts off with a bang and just keeps getting better.

This show has polish, style, and gives a new definition to slick. There is a fabulous blend of humor, suspense, and adventure. The actors shine in their roles and the writers are so good they were even able to use Gene Bellman's (Sophie) maternity leave as device to expedite the development of Nathan Fords character and create more cohesion between the entire cast.

If you're looking for excellent performances, terrific guest appearances, fabulous writing, and a show that you can't predict then Leverage is definitely a show you want to watch.",1272067200,2,699,4.965811965811966
3897585,5,B002BWP2JO,"This season not only boasts great one-liners from the actors and the writers, but also phenomenal guest appearances and acting that is better than it was before.  They've worked out some of the finer issues that people had with the Season One set (like closed captioning in English) and the deleted scenes are sure to be a hoot if the actual aired episodes are any indication.

If you're looking for plot, then this is definitely a show to watch.  Each one of these episodes is a ""mini-movie"" (according to show writer John Rogers) but there's also the major story arcs that flesh out each con.  Sure, there's the formula that the episodes follow, but the majority of the time I have to squint to see it because I get so caught up with the brilliant acting and writing.  With this show, it's so easy to forget that these are actors and the characters aren't real.

They handled Gina Bellman's pregnancy flawlessly (in the first viewing of the episodes where she's pregnant, I didn't notice the baby bump) and the temporary addition of Jeri Ryan was perfect.  That's not to mention the episode sporting Wil Wheaton as a hacker.",1269216000,26,1126,4.656565656565657
3897586,4,B002BWP2JO,"I love this show.  I was looking to buy season 2, but I am confused.  How can 15 episodes of this show be on one disk?  I don't understand that.

3897588,5,B002BWP2JO,"Smarter-than-average writing, engaging plotlines, and 3-dimensional (and non-stereotypical!) characters add up to a fun watch.  Ethical badguys use their criminal skills to scam the scammers and right wrongs against innocents.  I love that the female characters aren't helpless little victims, and the male characters give the women credit for being able to take care of themselves.  The computer geek isn't geeky, the business guy isn't soulless, the female con artist isn't a 25-year-old bimbo, the catburglar isn't a bond girl, and the tough guy isn't a thick-necked Eastern European.  There's a lot of good social engineering, fun relationship subplots, and each episode's scam is full of interesting (and sometimes overly fearless) twists and turns.

This is one of the better TV shows out there for viewers with an IQ above 95.  Not that it's overly intellectual, but it's not insultingly stupid and implausible.  A very pleasant surprise, and one of the few shows for which I eagerly await the next episode.",1263772800,,1014,5.260869565217392

They have all found that after doing good deeds, crime just isn't what it used to be. Whether it's tangling with the Irish mob, dealing with a shady boxing promoter, returning a corrupt investment banker's ill gotten gains, or ensuring that an inheritance goes to the rightful heir, all exhibit the savvy wit and quirkiness that has become the Leverage signature.

Thank goodness for TNT - which produces some of the best dramas on television. With plenty of nail biting action, humor, great music soundtrack, and ripped from the headline stories, the momentum just keeps building. And the chemistry among the cast is first rate, seamlessly adding Jeri Ryan to the cast late in the season when Gina Bellman (Sophie) took a hiatus due to her pregnancy. One of my favorite scenes is in the first episode when hacker Hardison introduces himself and Parker as detectives Costigan and Costello - an homage to the outstanding film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

3897925,5,B002BWP2JO,"Having enjoyed season 1 immensely I immediately started watching the second season of Leverage.  The cliffhanger ending from last season had the team scattered and on the run from the authorities.  After a shaky and contrived first episode reuniting the team things settle back into the successful formula that makes this show a blast.  Gina Bellman who plays ""grifter"" Sophie has a diminished role due her pregnancy but her high heels are ably filled by Star Trek Next Generation bombshell, Jeri Ryan.  The character development of the rest of the crew moves along nicely and the season wraps up with Sophie back but Nate (Timothy Hutton) makes a deal to give himself up for his team to get a pass.  The dialog is crisp and the cons are slick as Team Leverage helps out folks with no other recourse.  If you like caper type shows then Leverage delivers.  On to Season 3 of this fast paced show.",1451433600,,895,4.662420382165605

The little differences, bickering and disagreements makes it a dysfunctional family but in the end they all have each others' backs.  The characters are proving to themselves over and over that they can be good bad guys.  Sometimes as an observer I can feel their pain and their need to do something good.",1448668800,,413,4.956521739130435

3898070,1,B002BWP2JO,"The first series was given to us as a Christmas gift and we really rather enjoyed it; silly fluffy brain-out nonsense though it was. This second series, however, is dire. The script-writing and plotting have become dull and formulaic with none of the wit of the first series, the characters are reduced to no more than improbable cardboard cut-outs and the thin back-story that held the first series together has vanished. Each episode is just another silly, repetitive con with absolutely no character or back-story development and, as for the appalling DVD menu music...'nuff said! Even the appearance of Jeri Ryan to replace the annoyingly not-quite-English Gina Bellman (who has been relegated to a most improbable cameo role) could not lift our spirits. To misquote seven of nine; enjoying this is futile, you will not be assimilated.",1420934400,,839,5.131386861313868

In season 2 production moved from LA to Portland, with a 9 summer episode and a 6 episode the following winter. In season 2 as in the other 4 seasons, these 5 actors meld into one (yet remain distinct) as an incredible working group, something akin to the current NCIS. I watch Leverage via YouTube on my Smart TV, but there were very few of season 2. Thanks Timothy, Gina, Christian, Beth and Aldis for great entertainment. I'd recommend Leverage to everyone, especially those wanting to see justice for wrongs done to honest people. A.H. in real life, is the same A.H. in the series.",1396569600,,815,4.582191780821918

3898186,5,B002BWP2JO,"I think that whenever you love a television show, you should get the DVD as homage to a show that you loved but also because of the DVD extras. First, the weakness of this DVD set is that there doesnt appear to be any cast member commentary which is a shame because there are occasions when watching the show that I wonder why a cast member made a particular choice or how much fun did a cast member (or couple of cast members) have in a scene. So I hate not having them there to explain their view point. With that said, I love hearing the producers, directors, and writers provide input on scenes and/or the process to get to a scene.

The contributors are a chatty group so make sure that youve watched the episode so many times that you know whats going on without hearing. And they appear to have made a conscious decision to not watch the show rather to comment. So they aren't watching the show with you they are talking about what went on behind the scenes. They talk about some of the infamous Hardison scenes and Aldiss improvational skills which they really love and trust. They talk about Pardison and conscious decisions that were made to be physically stand next to one another to show their growing relationship. That talk about Kane humor and the humorous actions and expressions that he brings to Eliot that I had never really thought about. They discuss sibling relationships (Eliot, Parker, Hardison) the father/son dynamic between Nate and Hardison, and the equals relationship between Eliot and Sophie/Nate. These are things that you saw as a fan but its good to hear it discussed.

Im only on season two but it is the conspiracy episode where the reporter has ruined a guys career so the team sets out to discredit the reporter. In the episode, Parker becomes curious about conspiracies and begins to ask Eliot about different conspiracies. Not sure who it was but someone mentioned that he sent a note to a big wig and asked, How is Eliot responding to Parker. The reply came back, Like a big brother effing with his baby sister. Its something that we saw but it was nice to hear that response.

As indicated, Im only on season 2 but Im so pleased with my decision to purchase this. I purchased seasons 1 - 3 together because the 5 season bundle wasn't offered. But Im going to have to get seasons 4 and 5 soon because I am watching a season a weekend. Its a shame that TNT cancelled this show because it really was a fun show to watch.",1395014400,,2459,4.484375
3898187,5,B002BWP2JO,I watched this show when it was on TNT and fell in love with it.  The acting was phenomenal and the chemistry between all the actors was evident from day one.

I know part of it is that it is filmed in my hometown of Portland OR and that makes it fun to try and pick out the locations.  The other part is that it is pure escapist with a nice sense of humor and a cast that it is easy to get involved with.

I noticed she didn't remain which lead me to believe the writers were on the same page.  New person and character portrayed would probably be good on another show but not this one.  I don't remember her name but have seen her on other shows; somehow she didn't add to those either. Maybe she'll find her place.",1385856000,,486,4.488636363636363

3898244,5,B002BWP2JO,This was an interesting season. We get on and off Sophie - but this allows for the overall development of the Leverage team. The fun is still there and we see the evolution of Nathan and the team to being a more cohesive unit. We get Tara for a little bit - which adds some spice to the overall team. Great continuation of the previous season and a lot of fun. If you like Leverage or even a modern day Mission Impossible - this is the show for you!,1385683200,,449,4.056179775280899

3898296,5,B002BWP2JO,"Great series. If you love the show, all the seasons are must-haves. Sometimes the basis of the series gets old with rehashed story lines. Not so with Leverage. One hint is not to watch the extras until the end - some have spoilers in them.",1370822400,,239,4.333333333333333
3898297,5,B002BWP2JO,"How you view Season 2 of Leverage will depend largely on how you view Gina Bellman's ""Sophie Devereaux"" and all of the underlying melodrama, the romantic tension between her character and Timothy Hutton's ""Nathan Ford"" (it's Leverage's ""Sam and Diane"" will they / won't they meme). Gina spent most of season two preparing for the birth of her daughter, and the series creators brought in Jeri Ryan to cover for her...not ""replace"" her. She's seen in countless ""on the phone"" segments to remind you that she's away, but not ""gone."" That gives Hutton plenty of opportunities to bounce back and forth between ""giving her space"" and asking her to ""come home.""

This gave Aldis Hodge the opportunity to shine in ""The Ice Man Job,"" because the team ""needed a grifter,"" and with Sophie absent, Hardison stepped in. Of course, he's not a grifter by nature, so his masquerade leads to his being captured by the Russian mob. The series creators also take full advantage of this, using Christian Kane's ""Eliot"" character to rib Hardison over this in a later episode. The cast really excels at the ""sibling rivalry"" discord...they can come together to pull off a ""job,"" but they can also squabble like kids who have had too much sugar. The series creators wisely keep this in check and never go overboard with it. In small doses, it's fun. Overdone and ""Leverage"" would become ""Three's Company"" in a heartbeat.

Beth Riesgraf as ""Parker"" shines here, especially in the ""Ice Man Job"" episode (""No stabbing, Parker!""). She's smart enough to pull off major heists but is conflicted in every way imaginable when it comes to dealing with others on a ""normal"" basis...case in point the first Season 2 episode, where Hutton wakes up to find her eating cereal in a nun's outfit. She's gorgeous and crazy and brings an ongoing sense of oddball charm to what is already a somewhat oddball cast and concept.

Timothy Hutton definitely sinks his teeth into the multiple characters he plays...some ridiculously eccentric (like Dr. Melcher and his ""Melcher Method""). Others are more ""normal,"" but the undercurrent of the Ford character is that you have a recovering alcoholic whose life is still a mess in many ways (including the ""is this a relationship"" relationship with Sophie). He manages to pull together a team of criminals to do one Robin Hood good deed after the other, and there are times when the Ford character...even in moments of success...seems empty inside. He will occasionally order a drink (his condo, the ""team clubhouse,"" sits over a bar) and walk away without taking a sip. Sherlock Holmes had cocaine, Nathan Ford has alcohol. Every genius has his or her demons.

This series is head and shoulders above the normal ""cable TV drama"" in every way. Killer cast, well-written eposides, and actors who seem to have a great deal of fun. Highly recommended.",1370563200,,2847,4.9004149377593365

But as an invitation to suspend disbelief for a while, watch good actors make all the right moves, see well written material that is also fun and has an ending you can feel good about, and simply drop out of every day life-  with all the angst our ""leaders"" and banks and corporations have piled upon us - this is the one to own.

3898355,5,B002BWP2JO,This Leverage DVD set of 4 disks is great. It includes bloopers which is something I enjoy watching. All the shows are so good. Each week the team gets to play a different character which I would assume would be an actors dream. I love the show and wish it would have been renewed. I highly recommend this DVD.,1360368000,,310,4.271186440677966

3898380,5,B002BWP2JO,I love the cast and the storylines.  It's like the old Mission Impossible series but a little more high tech.  And the characters more flawed.  I'm sorry to see it go off the air.,1358899200,,179,4.205882352941177

3898382,5,B002BWP2JO,"What I really like about it is the team. It is made up of very independent individuals who are master criminals. The key is how they have been enticed to work for Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton's character). They all contribute to the cause and, because of it, find they are a very powerful force that can get them more of what they are looking for. There is also a camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long, long time.",1358553600,,416,4.2784810126582276

3898387,5,B002BWP2JO,"This series is light, fun, doesn't take it'self too seriously but still covers some serious situations.  It makes me laugh a lot and I simply love the interaction of the characters.  Parker is by far my absolute favorite character followed closely by Elliot and Hardison.  Not sure which of them I like better, I think it's about equal.  If you are looking for a new series that focuses on the happy ending and has fun character interactions and dialog, I recommend this series.

If you are looking for realism and serious handling of characters in life situations, then this series is not for you.",1357084800,,598,4.711538461538462

3898427,5,B002BWP2JO,"Talk about merry men getting into a bunch of trouble, yet having the wits to get out as effectively. Nathan Ford and gang are back, giving overlooked and disadvantaged people a reason to hope as they take down very corrupt businesspeople, proffessional cons, and even old enemies.
This time, there's much more feeling to each adventure, especially the episodes where Sophie isn't around and is replaced by a dear friend of hers. The gang felt like I did, wanting Sophie back, and when they try to get int touch with her, things can get very emotional. Not only Sophie's replacement, but also scenarios that happen get gripping, like a childhood secret of Parker's, told publicly by a fraudulent psychic (""Can we kill him? I want him killed!"") that not only get her crying, but shatter one's perception of her formerly uncrackable shell.
All the situations that happen in this season were nothing short of jaw-dropping, whether by the comical moments, the plot twists, or the twist reveals, there was nothing in any episode that didn't get me very good. It'll be hard waiting to get the next season.",1352160000,,1098,4.845744680851064

3898452,5,B002BWP2JO,"I have always remembered episode 2 because of the lines that Elliott states.  The episode always inspires me.  I love this show!

I watch Leverage almost every night.  It is so inspirational to see the good guys win and the bad guys lose.  Moreover, it reminds me of all the greats - A-Team, Oceans 11 and Robin Hood.  (It refers to each at least in one episode.)
I wish the show had continued forever.  Although, season 5 had a few episodes where the scripts were not as good as other seasons; however, the acting, sets, wardrobe and everything else was always great.
Aldis Hodge developed and performed so well as an actor that he truly was the breakout character.  He will soon become Hollywood's leading man - Denzel, Robert, Samuel, Kevin, Forest, Leo, Idris, Ethan, Will, Al, Jamie, Johnny",1349568000,,795,4.669064748201439

Makes me wish I was on the set with them each day of shooting. :)",1349481600,,237,4.1521739130434785
3898454,5,B002BWP2JO,"My daughter turned me on to Leverage; she said, ""It's just the kind of show you'd enjoy."" She was so right! The Second Season is better than the first because I've gotten to know the characters a little and look forward to the banter and humorous antics. A modern day Robin Hood but with more serious and devious criminals to deal with. There is great satisfaction in seeing the bad guy get just what he deserves. Nate says something like, ""We take over where the police leave off."" But they work with the police and don't make them look like idiots like some other shows or movies. My favorite actor is Hardison who has a lot of the best lines and is very valuable with his computer and smart phone skills. If you like action, adventure, romance, tear jerking, and crime at its best you should definitely get yourself a copy of Leverage: The Second Season.",1348444800,,857,4.5
3898455,5,B002BWP2JO,The acting in this show is superb! I love the intricacies of Elliot and Parker's characters. It's a finely written and even better executed show. It has a very distinctive niche lol,1347840000,,181,4.6875

She's so trashy and outrageously arrogant. I can't watch these episodes because of her, and any time I try to I just end up changing the channel or doing something else instead. I hate missing out on almost an entire season because her character is so disgustingly awful. While the show is good, 3 stars is generous for having a whole season rendered un-watchable for me.",1333584000,,537,4.434343434343434

3898496,3,B002BWP2JO,I am hard of hearing.  The lack of captions is really causing me to down grade this good series.  Why can they not subtitle the series?

3898527,5,B002BWP2JO,"If you're already familiar with Leverage, I don't need to explain how Hardison is the character who most aptly combines hi-tech wizardry with humor and the occasional poignant moment.  In this episode, he takes the lead on a job involving diamond smugglers, and it is both one of the funniest and slickest cons of the series.  I've liked nearly all the episodes each season, but this is one of my favorites because it showcases Hardison, the character with the most feeling and most opportunities to exhibit his comedic talent.  Actor Aldis Hodge has both, and his character never fails to captivate.",1314144000,,600,4.920792079207921

3898616,4,B002BWP2JO,"I just received the second season DVD of Leverage and after watching all the episodes I started watching again, with commentary.  This was a big mistake.  There are two or three points I want to address.  First, the commentators seemed to be under the mistaken impression that they were in a fraternity locker room where it's cool to swear.  These are allegedly adults.  They should have outgrown this childishness long ago.  I don't care what they do in private but when they are addressing the public they should have more courtesy. Second, they spent so much time yapping about Portland (""This was the X building in Portland"" and ""We shot this in Y spot in Portland"" and ""Portland was so good to us"" and ""These were local actors who adopted a Boston accent"")that it is now impossible to imagine that the Leverage team is in Boston. Why didn't they just set the thing in Portland? Also, I don't want the magic taken away, which means I don't want to hear about every little detail about special effects and when a stunt double is being used.

The level of commentary is mediocre.  I just watched two movies that had good quality commentary: ""Seven Days in May"" with John Frankenheimer commenting and ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" where one of the commentators mentioned the difference between older movies that had to rely on various levels of talent, compared to movies of today that rely on technology.  That talent is in short supply is often apparent when a commentator remarks on how amazing it is that an actor can move from one emotional level to another.  That's what they do, folks.  They're actors.

That said, I want to comment on the third season.  Wow!  They have some inspired writing this year.  Season Three is sizzling.  There is particularly good character development this season with all kinds of hidden talent surfacing, especially with regard to Parker, Hardison and Elliott.  The plots are interesting and varied. There's some writing talent here; they don't seem to feel the need for the inevitable car chase or explosions with cars cartwheeling all over the set.  They are relying on the characters to tell the story. In fact Leverage has replaced The Closer and Burn Notice as my favorite show this season.",1280880000,,2230,4.778067885117493

The addition of another player for part of the season is to cover Gina Bellman's pregnancy, which can be see as not very well hidden in the last ep. Great show, great season.

3898648,5,B002BWP2JO,"The second season picks up with putting our team back together, but now based in Boston rather than LA. The hiatus of Gina Bellman's Sophie partway through the season could have been handled much more poorly and Jeri Ryan ably fills in as Sophie's handpicked substitute. The team continues to gel as a unit and the viewer gets a very real sense of how much these actors are enjoying themselves. Tim Hutton does a great job as Nate and gets to hold the center down while his character comes to terms with his new life. The other three, Christian Kane's Eliot, Aldis Hodge's Hardison, and Beth Riesgraf's Parker, all shine as their characters get plenty to do and to come together as the thieves Nate has turned into Robin Hood's. Mark Sheppard returns as Sterling in few shows, but my personal favorite of this season is the Sterling-less The Bottle Job.

However, the discs themselves are a little bare-boned. The S1 disc's had some deleted scenes and a great extra of Aldis Hodge improvising a scene in about a dozen different ways in a dozen different takes. S2 has some neat behind the scenes stuff you only need to watch once and a gag reel. Maybe there's an Easter egg I haven't found yet.

The commentaries are pure fun though. They're not terribly informative if you're into the technical aspect of TV production, but they do offer great insight into the writing process behind the show. I only wish some of the actors took part in the commentaries as well.",1277683200,,1464,4.626923076923077

3898651,5,B002BWP2JO,"""LEVERAGE"" is the hit TV drama series on TNT executive produced by Dean Devlin (""Godzilla"", ""Independence Day"" and ""Universal Soldier""), Chris Downey (""The King of Queens"") and John Rogers (""Cosby"") and also to see involvement by Jonathan Frakes (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Roswell"") as a director and Amy Berg (""The 4400') as a writer/producer.

""LEVERAGE"" stars Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton (""The Good Shepherd"", ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Last Mimzy""), Christian Kane (""Angel"", ""Close to Home""), Aldis Hodge (""Red Sands"", ""Friday Night Lights""), Gina Bellman (""Coupling"", ""Jekyll"" and ""Permanent Vacation""), Beth Riesgraf (""Struck"") and Mark Sheppard (""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Dollhouse"") who are part of a group of thieves who steal from the corrupt and give to the needy.

For the first season, the series would become a major hit for TNT as it became the #1 program on Tuesday nights with solid ratings for the drama series.  As the series is now approaching its third season, the second season will be available on DVD featuring 15 episodes on 4-DVD's and plenty of special features!

""LEVERAGE"" revolves around former Insurance Investigator Nate Ford (Timothy Hutton) who has exposed scams and recovered stolen items worth millions for his insurance company. But when it came to getting his son's medical treatment covered, his insurance company denied it and his son died because he was unable to get the treatment he needed.

One day, someone gives Nate a chance to get back at his insurance company, if he teams up with a group of thieves and manages them. In the process, Nate realizes the good that this group can do (and at the same time fulfilling their needs for stealing and making money) and creates a company called Leverage Consulting & Associates which was created to help those with major insurance problems and give them leverage and making sure that what happened to him, will never happen to anyone else.

For the second season, Nate and the Leverage team decide to reunite but this time around, the jobs they have are much more riskier including the group taking on a popular government official and not knowing that Nate's rival  James Sterling is back and now working for Interpol and is trying to capture Nate.

VIDEO:

Overall, ""LEVERAGE"" looks very good for a television drama. Featured in Widescreen, a lot of scenes are done in the indoors and outdoors that is where the series is most vibrant and more colorful. Like most drama series on DVD, it's when you get into low light situations and you do see artifacting.  But I have to admit that ""Leverage"" has been one of those titles with very good video and personally, this is one series that I would have loved to see released on Blu-ray.  But overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" is stylishly cool in terms of visual appeal.

AUDIO:

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and definitely utilizes the front channels for its explosions and rear surrounds take advantage of action sequences. I discovered use of LFE as well and overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" sounds great. Dialog is easy to understand and more than enough action sequences on each episode.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""LEVERAGE"" features many special features as each disc has optional audio commentary for EVERY episode. The fourth disc is where the majority of the special features are located. Included on the fourth disc are:

  * The Creators of Leverage Q&A - (18:55) Executive producers John Rogers, Dean Devlin and Chris Downey talk to a live audience about how the origins of the show came about and casting the talent for ""Leverage"".
  * John Rogers Set Tour - (3:08) Executive Producer John Rogers talks about shooting in Portland, Oregon and a tour of Leverage HQ.
  * Behind the Boom Featurette - (7:14) A featurette on the creation of special effects for ""Leverage"".  In this featurette, the creation of a major explosion in a building.
  * ""The Hand Job"" Spoof Video - (5:08) Actor Aldis Hodge shows people how to do things the Leverage way.
  * Andy Lange Music Featurette - (2:58) Singer/songwriter Andy Lange talks about utilizing his music on the show.  The producers talk about how they came about using Andy's music on the show.
  * Season 2 Wrap Party Gag Reel - (9:02) Featuring the bloopers from season 2 of ""Leverage"" plus the cast and crew of ""Leverage"" doing gags on set.

EXTRAS:

""Leverage - The 2nd Season"" comes with a cardboard slip-over case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

From the first episode of ""Leverage"", I was sold.  Solid writing, cool characters and overall, the first season was exciting and enjoyable.  The second season turns up the notch as we see more action and also the odds against the team slightly higher.  The characters are truly tested and by the end of the final season, it definitely makes you excited (as well as a bit impatient) for the upcoming third season.

I was very impressed with the first season and each talent really brings their A game to the series. Timothy Hutton plays a convincing role as the mastermind of the group; Gina Bellman brings that sexiness that she had in BBC's ""Coupling"" to the series but added depth as a true-to-art con artist; It's great to see Christian Kane again kicking butt since his years on ""Angel"" and also to see the two talents Beth Riesgraf and Aldis Hodge definitely shine in this series. The characters are well, cast, well-planned, well integrated into the series and I really enjoyed the amount of character development we see in each episode. Despite being thieves, they are all likable in their own way.

If anything, we are starting to see the chemistry of each characters gel and also, I like how things are starting to heat up between Nate and Sophie.  As for the addition of Jeri Ryan to the second season of ""Leverage"", she's a bit of a wildcard.  You can picture her helping the team but at the same time, but unlike the other members, she's been used to the con life for awhile and she can play both sides and thus, it'll be interesting to see how her character is utilized in the future.

I also felt the writers bringing back Mark Sheppard for Jim Sterling was smart.  He is the true antagonist for the group and how the ended the second season definitely will have viewers wanting to know what happens for the third season.

Usually, there tends to be some drop-off when it comes to storytelling but the writers managed to keep things exciting and fresh, now that we are seeing the group becoming more mobile as they take on various jobs nationwide.  But this time, the jobs they are taking on are much riskier and can lead to their downfall.

For those who haven't watched the first season, it helps to know the background and why Nate is driven to work with a group of thieves but the series is easy to follow, so it's not going to be hard to follow the storyline for season two.  But I do recommend watching the first because it goes into the team dynamics and also learning about Nate's drive for what he is doing.

As for the DVD, similar to the last season's release, it's packed with special features and commentary.  I think that fans of the show will be entertained by the amount of content included.  The commentary tracks are actually informative and there are a good amount of humor in the commentary tracks, in fact, no worries about the commentary being dry as they keep the commentary tracks quite lively.

Overall, ""Leverage"" fans will enjoy this latest DVD release.  Fifteen exciting and enjoyable episodes, plenty of special features content and like the first release, ""Leverage - The 2nd Season"" is quite solid and I doubt anyone will be disappointed.  Definitely recommended!",1276646400,2,9740,4.648711943793911
3898652,5,B002BWP2JO,"I truly enjoy this series......  It reminds me of the old Mission Impossible TV series.....  I love the characters, they are an eclectic group of individuals that work well together and share a bond that you don't see in most TV programs.  They have/show compassion with each other and with their clients.
I will be so glad when the new season starts up, and I am super glad that Sohpie is back!!!",1276473600,3,397,4.486111111111111
3898653,3,B002BWP2JO,"The first season of Leverage was a breath of fresh air in a time when most shows had started to stagnate. It was fast, and fun, if a little silly. The characters were well thought out and extremely enjoyable, as were their interactions with each other. I came into the second season expecting something like the first except more polished. I was shocked to see that it was just the opposite.

Where the last season was just barely believable, this one was way over the top with the kind of stunts they pulled to get the bad guys in the end. Fake virus outbreaks, horrible magic shows, and conspiracy theories are only some of the misteps that this season took. The thrill of this show was seeing how these modern day robin hoods worked was seeing their high tech gadgets, and expertise in using them. Dressing up in unfunny costumes to achieve their goals was the preferred course of action far too often. The worst offender was Timothy Hutton as Nate Ford. When Tim is playing Nate as Nate, he is brilliant. He can be tortured, charming, funny, and underhanded all at the same time. When he dons one of his numerous costumes however his performance is actually painful to watch. Why they insist on Nate playing dress up is beyond me. The rest of the cast however, are able to shift in and out of disguise almost flawlessly.

I know this is sounding like I hate this season, but the fact is that a handful of episodes are so good that I bought it anyway, knowing that they were in the minority. In: ""The two live crew Job"" the team goes up against a crew of their on dopplegangers( also Will Wheaton gives a great performance in this one), ""The Ice Man job"" has the team helping Hardison out of a very funny jam of his own creation, ""The bottle job"" sees Nate push himself and the Team to the limits with how quickly they can con a loan shark out of their neighborhood. The best episodes in the season has to be nearly flawless two part season finale. I won't give anything away, but the ending is quite satisfying.

All in all, if you aren't a die hard Leverage fan I would rent, or download certain episodes from this very mediocre season.",1275523200,6,2141,4.428934010152284
