680339,5,6303566634,We love watching these movies at home.  They never get old and I can't wait to watch them over and over again.,1355875200,,110,4.0
680340,5,6303566634,"Good buy....however, it's the first and the last of the collection...not really what I'd call a true ""collection""...a collection should be all the movies in the Terminator series...agree?",1342396800,15,187,5.714285714285714
680341,5,6303566634,"Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.

In an example of the future affecting the past, John Connor, Sarah's adult son, dispatches a trusted aide named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect her from the nearly indestructible cyborg. Sarah bonds with Kyle in their mutual struggles. They make love and thus John is conceived.

THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).

Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death, but first, Sarah must be freed.

Both ""Terminator"" and ""T2"" are enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace of both is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.

These are two great movies!

My husband and I have recently been introducing my oldest son to old school action movies; and it doesn't get much better than the Terminator series. We have been purchasing them one movie at a time and have had a hard time finding T3 and 4. However, I previously thought we would have had to purchase these separately, too, but we didn't. I was super excited when I found such a great deal on this set: 2 movies for less than the price of one! And they both come in tact and sealed new. You can't get much better than that. And you can't beat the amazing action sequences and amazing one-liners in the Terminator movies. It's unreal. I love it and so does my husband and son. You can't beat it. Way too cool and so much fun. Love it.",1469750400,2,794,4.230263157894737

680863,5,6303566634,"Out of the first 3 Terminator Movies this is by far the best; and the actress who plays the she villain is not only sexy as hell, she can act and most convincingly...and steals the show as far as I'm concerned.  I didn't particularly want Terminator Salvation, but it was the best deal I could find to get the movie I wanted.  Like the first 2 Planet of The Apes movies, I suspect that Terminator Salvation and future Terminator movies will not hold a candle to Terminator 3, or for that matter its' predecessors.  And with changing the actors constantly, they begin to lose much of their credibility...and come up lame!",1438041600,,620,4.5675675675675675

Clair Danes was excellent as Catherine Brewster. Not to mention the female Terminator. That was GREAT! In Salvation,  Christan Bale was EXCELLENT as the adult freedom fighter John Connor. I doubt any actor would have been a better choice for the role. Also excellent was Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright. No matter that he was a despicable person before, Marcus emerged as the real hero of the movie.",1400371200,3,538,4.723404255319149

681171,4,6303566634,"I made my purchase for two reasons: I enjoy watching the movies and I saw the set at a good price. (They may have been on sale when I purchased them.) Since I only have recordings of them on my DVR, I thought a physical copy would be good in case something happened to the DVR. While these two movies are good, they are not as good as the first two. Considering Terminator and T2 came out in 1984 and 1991 respectfully, I'm surprised I still enjoy those two more than either T3 or T4. Of the two newer films, I would identify T4 as the lowest quality movie. Although it wasn't bad, I don't find it as enjoyable to (re)watch as the first two; the third film is a step or two below the first pair of movies.",1364860800,3,705,4.079136690647482

7850154,4,6303566634,Rise of the Machines is definetly a 5 star movie that continues the saga of John Conner. It shows continuity with the previous two films and ends on Judgement Day. Terminator Salvation is more of a three star movie. It shows almost no connection with the previous three films and takes place in the future. It also kind of ruined by the fact that Christian Bale plays the hero. Its difficult to imagine him as playing any hero other than Batman.,1492300800,,445,4.506172839506172

7850156,3,6303566634,"This features the third and final of the original trilogy of the original films and then one of John Conner as a grown up. T3 is a fun watchable film with a brief mention of thing to come. Two of the original stars appear, engaging. This time a female machine does the bidding. Was surprised by the ending.

# IV is of John as a grown man with a wife and he is surprised to encounter a different kind of machine. he reviews his mom's recordings for advice and is unsuccessful. Not very engaging. A let-down. Arnold's 1984 face appears briefly.",1487894400,,543,4.376237623762377
