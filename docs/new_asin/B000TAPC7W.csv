8208415,2,B000TAPC7W,"Woefully painful to watch!

I'm not a prude when it comes to swearing, but the writer of this movie was somewhat at a loss for words, and seemed more than fond of the 'F' word.  A few swear words here and there would have been appropriate, but with almost every other word being his favorite one, it made the movie sound really amateurish. I admit I didn't watch the whole thing, but what I did watch was woefully painful to see. Definitely a B grade movie. Maybe it got better as time went on, but I figured the writing probably wasn't going to get any better, so I bailed.",1519344000,,574,4.256880733944954

8208417,4,B000TAPC7W,"It definitely was a ""B"" movie, but I really enjoyed most of it.  Basically it started off with all these people waking up in a room together and having NO IDEA why they were there ... and as the movie progressed they started to ""remember"" who they were and who the other people were in the room, and slowly how and why they are all tied together in the story.  The ending was a bit confusing for me.",1489276800,,399,4.102564102564102

8208419,5,B000TAPC7W,"This was my first B Movie and I am hooked!  I thought it was incredibly creative and well thought out plot, poorly produced but otherwise an awesome movie.  We got a pack of four of these films in a gift exchange and have started a new Sunday night B Movie tradition in the house.  That said, I wouldn't pay 15 bucks for it.",1292198400,4,324,4.111111111111111
8208420,2,B000TAPC7W,"The plot was good and the head vamp was pretty cool,  but it is a brain damage film and it's cheesy.  With a more high budget producer it could be really good.  Don't waste money on it, but if you want to see it rent it or borrow it.",1276473600,,233,3.7142857142857144
