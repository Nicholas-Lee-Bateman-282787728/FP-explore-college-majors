767778,5,6304039212,"I bought this DVD because I loved ""Smoke"". I must admit, this film is not as good as ""Smoke"". The story line is much looser, the characters are not worked-out as well, and often there is a kind of documentary-style of filming. Though it is nice to see some major stars, such as Roseanne and Madonna - yes, she plays one of her best roles ever! - improvize in this film (because that's what they're doing), I was slightly disappointed. ""Smoke"" had this special feel to it which this film lacked...

But don't get me wrong - this film is still much better than many Hollywood blockbusters. This is why I still rated the film 5 stars. It deserves it, as much as ""Smoke"" deserves 10!",1139184000,2,679,4.388888888888889

767780,4,6304039212,"'Blue In The Face' chronicles a snapshot of life in Brooklyn NY. At the centre of this life is a cigar store that is frequented by a parade of weird and wonderful people. So that is it - there is no story line, or indeed it appears there is no script - just a series of 'situations' designed to be a wonderful showcase for the actors involved.
And what a cast of actors!!! Memorable performances by Lou Reed, Michael J. Fox, Madonna, Roseanne and a host of others make this movie a must see. They don't appear to have to operate within the confines of a script so their full ad-lib abilities shine. At the centre of the action is Harvey Keitel who gives a wonderful performance as the laid back cigar store worker.
Another fascinating angle to this movie is the inclusion of real Brooklyn residents describing Brooklyn and their lives. Even though the unstructured aspect of the movie makes for no story lines, it does seem as though it is a homage to Brooklyn and its residents.
The picture quality on this DVD is outstanding. Perhaps a little too soft in places, but otherwise it is hard to fault. No special features are included which is a shame. It would have been great to have interviews with the cast to hear their thoughts on the movie.
'Blue In The Face' is a bizarre movie, but with it featuring some very well known faces in roles they have not been seen in before, made Blue in the face riveting viewing for me.",1056758400,10,1424,4.418250950570342
767781,2,6304039212,"What a waste. It's terribly filmed and aimless. It also suffers from shoddy editing. Harvey Keitel is great, I don't think I've ever seen him in a bad film. But many charachters, such as the one played by Michael J. Fox, are only seen for a few brief minutes. There is no narrative, this movie is shameful compared to it's predecessor. I understand the directors wanted too do an ode to Brooklyn, but why, oh why, did they have to do it around a sequel to smoke?",1028419200,,462,4.32183908045977
767782,4,6304039212,"All events go on in one of the most famous districts of New York- Brooklyn.
 Ozzy's shop with tobacco is the centre of the action. People come there not only to buy cigarettes but also to talk, to meet some friends. A lot of funny, absurd situations take place in Ozzy's shop. We can see some famous faces such as Jim Jarmush who is giving up smoking, Harvey Keitel (Ozzy), Madonna and her provocative dance...
 ""Brooklyn Boogie"" is also a specific description of american city, inhabitants and their attitude towards living there. Lou Reed talks about New York, why he still lives there despite all that danger he meets everywhere.
 It's really interesting film. It has nice, relaxing atmosphere, good for sad winter evenings.",1008633600,,727,4.846774193548387
767783,5,6304039212,"I had no idea who this guy was...but his bit on Nazis and movies and cigarettes has caused me to recommend this movie to friends. I saw Smoke first and enjoyed it, but Blue in the Face will leave you rolling on the floor laughing..promise!",999216000,4,239,4.333333333333333
767784,5,6304039212,"I got this movie to hear Lou Reed talk about New York. It gets 5 stars for that, but it's much more than a few moments of Lou's brillance. I can't say this movie is better than ""Smoke"". It has less to it (no plot), but it mangaes to say a little more. Where ""Smoke"" is like a beautiful song with lyrics, ""Blue in the Face"" is an instraumental. It's harder to capture, because the viewer isn't forced into pitying or loving any character or the city of Brooklyn. The story doesn't have a plot to guide the viewer toward some monumental epiphany. Instead, the viewer listens harder, and produces fulfillment for themselves. Don't get me wrong, this is a very funny movie. Low budget or filmed in five days, this movie matters.",997315200,,724,4.451127819548872
767785,4,6304039212,"And why are there only three customer reviews of this brilliant, on-the-edge film?  And what's up with Leonard Maltin (see above)?  I think he was expecting a Hollywood Production Movie.  I think he would also ask  for a Belgian waffle in Belgium (can't get them, I learned from watching  this.)  There is a McGuffin, I guess, for those who must have a plot.  Will  the cigar store be sold or not?  Who cares?  I'd much rather hear Lou Reed  explaining the source of his life-long cynicism or why cigarettes are  really ""health tools.""  I had seen and enjoyed Smoke, but never  knew this film existed.  I am so glad I found it by chance.  I enjoyed it  more than Smoke.  I think it would be a great film to run at a party.  Regardless of the length and clarity of their attention spans, guests would  have to ask ""What is this?""  And gradually this film would get  the cult following it deserves (or maybe it already does and I don't know  it out here in the Midwest).  Of course, as always, I loved my main man,  Harvey Keitel which should go without saying.  (I wonder what Mr. Maltin  had to say about the uncut version of another Keitel film, The Bad  Lieutenant,"" another movie you won't be seeing on t.v.  If  ""innovative"" doesn't scare you, buy this.  I am still thinking  about the bag-in-the-tree man and Michael J. Fox's survey.  I think I need  to watch it again.",957744000,10,1374,4.407258064516129
7860068,5,6304039212,"I wish I could make a movie this funny and so easily. Five days, improvisations, not a definite storyline and a great and funny movie is born. I loved it, it still makes me laugh and will keep on making me laugh. All the actors are great, but if I had to give an award to one of them it would be Jim Jarmusch, with his ""last cigarette"" speech. Fantastic also is Lou Reed, and his conclusions about life. The movie really benefits from its addition of well-known stars, including a much-in-the-gutter character Michael J. Fox, which is really funny. The film also includes some curiosities about Brooklyn, and works not only as a set of vignettes but also as an account of what's typical and traditional in that neighbourhood. It has some cool moments and some touching moments, but overall it's a movie to see and not to analyse.",1496707200,,829,4.533333333333333

7860072,5,6304039212,The quintessential Brooklyn homage. And that's coming from a native Brooklynite. This film makes me smile and you'd be hard pressed to find a better snapshot of what it means to live in or be from the greatest borough in the World.,1383350400,,231,4.523809523809524

7860074,5,6304039212,"Delightful...but not for everybody.  There is no violence, car chases, or lame jokes...just good acting and comedy that takes a certain sense of humor to understand.

7860076,4,6304039212,"Wayne Wang's sequel to Smoke is equal to if not better than Smoke. Heard this one is more improvised and looser than Smoke. It has a great cast including Lou Reed(with a pair of cool glasses), Michael J. Fox, of course Harvey Keitel and Rosanne! This is a great little gem, with some moments of laughter, and a nice portrait of an ever-changing Brooklyn and its characters. Very much in the tradition of Jarmusch, maybe a little more comedy-based, but well done none the less. Blue in the Face is fun, and one to come back to once in a while. Pretty cool soundtrack too. Caution if you are an ex-smoker though, ha.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-in-the-Face/dp/B00008976Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue in the Face</a>",1268870400,,768,5.46218487394958
