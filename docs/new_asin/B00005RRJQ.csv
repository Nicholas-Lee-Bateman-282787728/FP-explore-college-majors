7952644,1,B00005RRJQ,"Save your money and just give a 5 year old a video camera. There are only two shorts on the whole DVD with any real artistic and cinematic qualities. The rest were enigmatic, trite, meaningless short films with bad acting and terrible dialogue (when present). The glowing reviews I read which prompted me to buy the DVD could only have been written by those that produced the films in hopes of luring your money out of your wallet, or, other people like me that hated it and want company for their misery so they aren't the only fools who got duped and purchased it. On a technical note, the DVD lacks any scene selection, forcing you to use fast forward/reverse to get to any place on the disk. There are no extras, special features, or captioning options (of which I need). It will reside in my coaster collection along with 150 AOL CDs and failed CD-R attempts.",1035072000,5,864,4.509554140127388
