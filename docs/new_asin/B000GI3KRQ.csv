It is far below average grade. But the worst of all: I was bored. For after watching 20 minutes of the movie, I pressed the fast forward button on the remote control. I had seen enough.

So do yourself a favor. Save your time and money on this film. I can assure you that there are better movies in this category that are worth a purchase. Try Gregory Dark`s ""Mirror Images 2"" with Shannon Whirry. It is so much more sexier than this rubbish movie.",1330041600,,618,4.282051282051282
8132633,5,B000GI3KRQ,"If you're looking for the same old thing, opening, slick, titles, music, relax, sit back, eat some popcorn, blah, blah, blah and whatever, whatever, whatever, buy something else.  Buy a studio movie and enjoy.  Microwave your popcorn because you don't want to take the time to pop it right and melt your own butter.

If you're open and adventurous, a lover of discovery, check out this film.

It's not Bruckheimer. It's not Ron Howard's latest pastel painting.

It is what it is, with no apologies.

This review might be of no help to anyone. But, I think those who need to get it will get it.  And to those: Watch this film.  It's exceptional.",1241568000,2,644,4.587719298245614
8132634,3,B000GI3KRQ,"Interesting camera work and documentary-like feel of the movie are unfortunately not enough to distract from the overbearing voiceovers (ofter real interviews with real twentysomethings). Furthermore, the abrupt storytelling leaver something to be desired. The movie feels intimate and engaging and honest at first but, ultimately, the characters are hard to care and emphasize with.",1232928000,,383,5.9818181818181815
8132635,1,B000GI3KRQ,I will keep it simple and short.  I purchased this on 12/2008 saw it and did not like it.  The story lacked all over the place.  Save yourself time and money.,1228694400,,158,4.032258064516129
8132636,3,B000GI3KRQ,"this type of movie is rare and very good, honest and enjoyable at that...as others have highlighted it is a candid look at peoples post college life styles, choices, relationships...while I enjoyed it a lot I found the sex scenes a little too phallically focused, what with the male masturbation scene in the shower thru to ejaculation, the rolling on of the male condom on the penis...and while there was female nudity it was not as explicit...so if you don't mind male nudity then this should be a good movie to watch as a couple...",1226102400,4,534,4.631578947368421
8132637,5,B000GI3KRQ,Its refreshing to see a sexy film that is grounded in reality. Certain to become a classic.,1173830400,10,91,4.411764705882353
8132638,1,B000GI3KRQ,"This movie was BAD from beginning to the very end. Poorly written,Poorly acted and HORRIBLY FILMED . I couldn't wait to rip it out of my DVD player and throw it in the garbage.",1172620800,8,176,4.205882352941177
8132639,5,B000GI3KRQ,"This was by far one of the better movies I've purchased. I loved the documentary stay real world format the film makers used. I really liked the up-front Real People do this approach to sex and nudity in the film. It was immesely refreshing. At last a frank intelligent film that deals with real people having sex, relationship issues and career problems that hasen't been glittered over in the fake style that Hollywood is becoming famous for. The actors were normal looking everyday attractive people who actually lived everyday lives. No Pre-fabbed pretty boys or Boob-job inhanced starlets. Highly recommend this movie for the serious movie buff.",1168560000,36,650,5.08411214953271
