3785744,5,B001SLNPSO,"On June 9, 2009, ""Shout! Factory"" released the third season of one of the best sitcoms ever to come down South Maple Street in Springfield (or any other street in America) -- ""Father Knows Best"".

After watching the first three discs of this 5-Disc DVD set, I'd have to say that Season 3 is even better than the first two seasons of FKB. But&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B0012Q3SZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B001D2WUCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>&nbsp;are darn good too (even if some of the first-year shows aren't ""uncut"").

I'm not an expert, but it seems to me as though the writing for the third year is a certain degree above the earlier seasons. I haven't noticed a misfire yet (through Disc 3, that is). These episodes are simply outstanding--every one of them--and I just felt like writing this review to say that.

But the thing that really prompted me to dash to the computer today to write these comments is one particular scene in the episode called ""Swiss Family Anderson"" (on Disc 3). That episode originally aired on network television over 50 years ago (on January 9, 1957), but it still seems fresh and relevant even today.

The scene in question occurs six minutes into the ""Swiss"" episode, just as the Anderson family is sitting down to dinner. Jim (Robert Young) begins to tell the rest of the family about how a work colleague of his wants him to take a look at an ""island"" property and size it up for a possible purchase (at the pretty good price of only $1,500).

What impressed me most about that dining-room scene is the way it was filmed and how it was ""choreographed"" (so to speak). The first 90 seconds of the scene were shot in one long, continuous take, without the camera moving one inch.

During that long, continuous shot, the family members are talking and filling their dinner plates by passing them around the table until everybody's got everything they need. It's like a ballet with the ham and potatoes.

After the camera cuts away from that long take, we get another fairly-lengthy unbroken take from the other side of the dining table, with Betty (Elinor Donahue) providing a very funny moment as she tries to convince ""father"" to add some more shower heads to the upstairs bathroom -- ""Nowadays, everyone has two heads! Lots of people have THREE!"" [LOL.]

(BTW, I guess perhaps I'm just old-fashioned or out of touch, but I have never seen a shower or bathtub that has had more than one shower head in it. And why in the world would anyone need two or three shower heads anyway? Does Betty plan on taking a shower with two additional people at the same time or something?) ~shrug~

Anyway, I suppose that scene really isn't anything super-special or unusual (there are probably similar scenes in other FKB episodes, and in other TV series too), but for some reason that scene I just described stood out for me when I watched it (and then rewatched it again right away, because I thought it was very good).

I think it's a good example of the high quality of this television series. The actors never miss a beat, the dialogue seems natural at all times (and the ""shower head"" banter was a truly hilarious moment), and the ""plate dance"" was a nice touch too. I just wonder if the aired version of that scene was Take #1? Or Take #21? :)

As for the other Season-Three episodes I've watched thus far, as I mentioned, I haven't seen a dud in the bunch yet, and this includes ""Never In Twain"", ""Margaret Hires A Gardener"", ""The Great Guy"", ""The Family Goes To New York"", and the very touching episode entitled ""The Homing Pigeon"".

In addition to the above episodes, this set also contains one of the very best (and surprisingly-exciting) episodes of any TV series I have ever seen. It's entitled ""Short Wave"", and after watching it for the first time, I found myself wanting to immediately watch this excellent, well-acted, and unusual episode again -- and I did.

I won't spoil the plot of ""Short Wave"", but if you've got this DVD collection and haven't yet watched that episode -- go watch it now. It's a winner.

The third-season DVD set also has several bonus features (some on each disc), including three complete episodes of the radio version of ""Father Knows Best"".

Plus, there are two full episodes of Robert Young's short-lived series ""Window On Main Street"", which premiered in 1961, shortly after FKB left the air.

These third-season episodes of ""Father Knows Best"" seem to be complete and unedited too (25+ minutes per show), with the word ""uncut"" appearing on the back cover of the DVD's outer slipcase, which is always a nice word to see in print on a TV/DVD package.

I don't recall having ever seen any of these Season-Three episodes in the past, except for a few minutes of ""Man About Town"", which just happened to be the episode that was airing on many ABC-TV affiliates between 1:30 and 2:00 PM on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, when news first broke about President Kennedy being shot by an assassin in Dallas, Texas.

Therefore, almost all of these episodes are brand-new to me. And I can hardly believe how really, really good these shows are. I've watched some of them two or three times already....and I haven't even gotten to Disc 4 yet. :)

But even without having seen the last two discs, I want to stamp the ""Father Knows Best: Season Three"" DVD set with the following two words:

Positively Recommended!

3785745,5,B001SLNPSO,"I love fkb, a great american show that is family oriented. the shows are uncut unlike the versions tv land had been playing. It seems like tv land has gone down hill since it hardly plays classic tv shows anymore, not like they were when they first came out since 1996. Love these shows and keep season 4,5 and 6 coming.",1246060800,,320,4.262295081967213
3785746,5,B001SLNPSO,"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT FATHER KNOWS BEST. A REAL CLASSIC SHOW, A REAL FAMILY SHOW. THEY DON'T MAKE SHOWS LIKE THIS ANY MORE.",1245888000,,122,4.125
3785747,5,B001SLNPSO,"Father Knows Best Season 3 is the Season I have been waiting to receive for a long time.  Season Three contains some really great uncut gems.  The Andersons had situated themselves in America's Conscious and the stories of Season Three are brilliant, funny, touching, and heartwarming.

Some Highlights:

""Short Wave"":  Bud gets a shortwave radio set and picks up the distress call from a family (much like the Andersons) out on a boat during a terrible storm as their engines fail and take in water. The coast guard cannot hear the distress but due to skipping short waves the Andersons hear it all.  This is an edge of the seat episode filled with tension.  Will the Andersons come to the rescue of the family at sea?

""Brief Holiday"":  Margaret Anderson is the most stable force in the Anderson household.  She is the hub around which everyone revolves.  So why is Margaret feeling tired of being in a rut?  What makes her go to Orleans Street (a sorta French Quarter of Springfield, who knew, lol) to buy a hat, eat French food and have her portrait drawn?  Is she no longer satisfied with just being a devoted Mom and Wife?

""The Angel's Sweater"":  Aunt Neva is visiting the Andersons at Christmastime.  Neva hates children and yells at Kathy over something minor.  Kathy hears a story about Christmas that transports the audience back to a Dickenesque Christmas.  Will Neva be transformed by the true meaning of Christmas?

""Betty and Jet Pilot"":  Bud discovers the helmet of a Jet Pilot in a parking lot and returns it to the pilot with his family.  After being treated to a jet ride, the Pilot becomes enamoured of Betty.  The story builds to the prospect of marriage right before a decision is made by the Air Force whether or not to send the pilot to Alaska.  Will Betty's pilot stay and marry her or will there be a bittersweet ending?

Other gems include:  ""The Spelling Bee"" (Kathy's beief that a lucky coin enables her to spell hard words), ""Safety First"" (Bud gets a traffic ticket while his dad is Chairman of the Safe Driving Committee), ""The Old Days"" (where Bud and Betty become their parents and Jim and Margaret become Bud and Betty, for a dance).  As usual with the releases there are 2 episodes of the ""Window on Main Street Show"" (a short lived show starring Robert Young after FKB).  Also included are three FKB radio programs.

When TV LAND came to being FKB was one of the shows on their network.  Now that TV LAND has left the era of the old Black&White sitcoms of the 50s and 60s for the sitcoms of the 70s,80s, and 90s...  DVD is the only realm you will find such a great old family program such as Father Knows Best!",1244851200,26,2647,4.546610169491525
3785748,5,B001SLNPSO,"By this point in the series FATHER KNOWS BEST had really hit its stride, and was a bona fide hit.

For season three, NBC and Screen Gems obviously poured a lot more money into the show because many of these episodes feature terrific on-location shooting -- no longer confined to the Anderson house, this season shows the family at college (""Betty Goes to College""), at a dude ranch (""Never in Twain""), at an Air Force base (the classic ""Betty and the Jet Pilot"") and even a desert island (""Swiss Family Anderson"").  New director Peter Tewksbury continues the fine tradition already established by season one/two director William D. Russell, and elicits wonderful performances from all five leads.

Here you get 37 UNCUT episodes (can you imagine any show doing that many episodes in a season today?), with very decent video and audio quality.

Hope sales for this are brisk so we see seasons four through six soon!",1244851200,11,914,4.839743589743589
3785749,5,B001SLNPSO,"I played a bit with the old and well worn motto ""The Third Time Is The Charm"" for the title of this review but the point translates well. With Set 3 featuring 37 UNCUT episodes that made up season 3 Shout Factory once again received the assitance of Robert Young's grandson and Eugene Rodney's estate and Sony's assistance in securing the uncut prints we all wanted!  As I stated before Sony is not getting any money from these sets yet they are digging through their vaults for the uncut shows.  We all need to continue to support the series sets to ensure the DVD releases will continue until the entire series is available!

Go over to shoutfactory.com and take their survey on what sets and series you want to see continue - we all need to support this wonderful series!",1242864000,11,774,4.514285714285714

The title is ironical. I've watched only a half a dozen shows so far, but in absolutely every show I've watched the father, Jim Anderson (Robert Young), emphatically does NOT know best, but has to learn what's best by if not painful then at least occasionally embarrassing experience. The show is not about a father, or even parents more generally, teaching children what's best in any straightforward or didactic way. It's about parents learning what's best and then endeavoring to communicate that insight gently and respectfully to their children. It is a lovely, warm, and inspiring program from an age when television made the kinds of deliberate efforts to aid in the intellectual and moral development of the citizenry that Aristotle advocated the state should make and of which he would have approved.",1399161600,,973,4.832335329341317

It is a great realistic family show, where the kids make trouble with one another and the mother and father are smart enough to know when to let the kids work it out on their own and when to get involved with some creative consequences.  Definitely a must see.  Wish all of the seasons were available on Amazon to watch.",1389225600,,523,4.3061224489795915

3785879,5,B001SLNPSO,"Wonderfully done-- and, in fact, contrary to rumors, Father doesn't always know best.  Indeed, he often knows least.

For the 1950s, this show as ahead of its time.  It dealt with family matters, but also larger issues, and did so in a light-hearted, endearing way.

One of the few sitcoms to show people actually doing household work-- for real!  The girls also broke stereotypes; Betty becomes a civil engineer for her work-internship day; Kathy is into rocket ships and helping Bud with his car.

Unlike today's sitcoms, there is no crudity, no foul language, no vulgar treatment.  Nor is all peaches and cream--or happy go lucky.  This is not a picture perfect family at all, contrary to the general cultural critiques of the show.  Well written episodes that are enjoyable to watch.",1360454400,,787,4.901515151515151

3785894,5,B001SLNPSO,"Not long ago I read an interview that Billy Gray (Bud) gave about ""Father Knows Best"" (FKB).  He said that the program did a disservice to children because life wasn't that ideal.  It was really because of that interview that I bought season 3, because I remembered FKB very warmly.  I enjoyed every one of these shows, and they were clearly done with loving care in terms of the writing and the performances.  And they weren't corny (like most of the situation comedies were back then).  In fact, I'm not really sure that -- despite a laugh track and warm humor -- that FKB is indeed a comedy.  I'd say it was more a family drama with humorous overtones.  And, Bud was wrong.  For many of us who were the age of the Anderson kids, life was much like what is depicted in the series.  My childhood was every bit as idyllic (although my teen years were much more troublesome due to changes in my family, including my gradfather's developing alcoholism).  Yet, with virtually every episode in this season's series, I could identify with guest characters or the plot as being somewhat similar to things that happened in my family or the other kids in my neighborhood.

Several of my favorite and most remembered episodes are in this set, including:

""The Angel's Sweater"": I remember this Christmas story so well...seemingly mean old Aunt Neva visiting and ruining Kathy's Christmas, and the heartwarming change of heart.

""Margaret Hires A Gardener"":  Or as I remembered it, the story of ""Fronk""!  :-)

Although they pale in comparison, the bonus episodes of ""Window On Main Street"" were very welcome, because I vaguely remembered the ill-fated series, and it was nice to see what that program was really like.

How good was this set?  Halfway through the episodes, I went out and ordered season 4!

Yes, this was America in the 1950s.  Too bad Bud's real life wasn't what many of us experienced.  Perhaps that's why such a talented young man became just another ex-child actor.",1299974400,8,1975,4.733137829912024

3785901,5,B001SLNPSO,"I think with this season the show had more warmth.  The first two seasons were funnier and even a
  little goofy, but season three everything came into focus.  I can't think of any other show from
  that era that had more heart.  Donna Reed show comes close as does Leave It to Beaver, but these
  shows didnt't have a great actor like Robert Young.  Also I think the stories were better as well
  as their house looking very real to me, in fact it looked like my house growing up with it
  shadows and such, especially in the kitchen.  I think FKB would have a better reputation if
  it had been called The Robert Young show or The Andersons of Springfield.  Most people, even
  my own friends, laugh and mock the show until I screen them a few select episodes and then
  they're like ""WOW, not too bad!""  I know everybody doesn't have a father who knew best, but
  this Norman Rockwell painting was a great fantasy.",1252022400,2,917,4.347305389221557

8339969,5,B001SLNPSO,"When we think of 1950s-era domestic sitcoms, FATHER KNOWS BEST and LEAVE IT TO BEAVER most readily come to mind.  Although FATHER is less well remembered today than BEAVER, it is just as fine a show, boasting the same high quality in writing, acting, directing and cinematography.  In many ways the two shows were complementary.  BEAVER presented a unique child's-eye view of the world, focusing on two young boys.  But FATHER had a richer range of family relationshipsthe Anderson family had three children, including two girls, of widely varying ages.  Jim Anderson (Robert Young) was the model of a thoughtful, principled, self-reflective father of that era.  Margaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) was also a pillar of strength and virtue as the mother of the family, while the three children (Betty, Bud and Kathy) braved the struggles of childhood and adolescence under the guidance of their parents. (Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin filled the roles of the children perfectly.) What I most admire in LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is its whimsical comic spirit.  FATHER KNOWS BEST was a drama first and foremost, with plots that were sometimes darker, dealing with topics like business ethics and the meaning of success.

Season 3 is up to the series' high standard.  Betty is in junior college and is looking forward to marriage with the right man; she also frequently mediates in family disputes.  Bud, now an upperclassman in high school, continues to smooth out his rough edges as he learns the right way to court a girl and fix a broken jalopy.  Kathy has some of the show's best comic lines.  One of the quirkiest episodes features movie star Cornel Wilde, playing himself as he passes through town and gets involved in a minor car accident.  All the episodes are a celebration of family, community, and love.

The DVDs leave nothing to be desired.  The film quality varies but is usually quite good.  One is struck by the expressive use of light and dark in the cinematography of many of the episodes, suggestive of film noir.  Extra features include two episodes of WINDOW ON MAIN STREETthe nostalgic small-town series in which Robert Young starred after FATHER ended its runas well as two episodes of the radio version of FATHER KNOWS BEST? (the question mark was there originally but was dropped for the TV show).

FATHER KNOWS BEST is an indispensable part of any vintage TV collection.",1514937600,,2397,4.905707196029777
