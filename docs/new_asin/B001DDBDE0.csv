8292827,5,B001DDBDE0,"An impressive narrative about colonialism and racism. It shows how brave africans heroes turn to prisioners and are finaly discarded. In this film, the protagonists aren't the colonist nor the colonized (those that displaced the colonist in the power game), but the victims of the process.",1448150400,,289,5.304347826086956
8292828,5,B001DDBDE0,"Excellent African viewpoint as to how the french colonial troops were viewed by their french rulers. Good enough to fight and die for France, but that was about it. With  the war over, these black troops were no longer needed so they were ""disposed of"" via armored vehicles fire.",1409875200,3,279,4.6938775510204085
8292829,5,B001DDBDE0,"This film should be shown to all Canadian high school students. It concerns historical events (WW2) that are largely hidden from view, and it is by a leading African film-maker, Ousmane Sembene. I never get tired of watching this amazing film.",1396396800,5,243,4.951219512195122
8292830,4,B001DDBDE0,"I saw this movie on TV many years ago.  Unfortunately, you won't find anything written about it that does it justice.  The cultural conflicts depicted in the film go beyond that between the African veterans and their French army masters. Early in the film, there's a conflict between the African veterans and an American military contingent.  Instead of stepping in and resolving it, the French allow it to fester and sneeringly look down on the Americans as just a bunch of hopeless racists (how very very European of them).  When the French are finally dragged in to resolve things, there's an amusing scene where the de facto leader of the Africans (being the only man in the camp fluent in French and English) has to act as interpreter for his supposed superiors.

I was dfrawn into the movie initially because it features a mute, shell shocked, excitable character amongst the African veterans who wears a German army helmet and whose frequent bouts of anxiety are quelled only by the sound of the German propaganda song Lili Marleen.  It's interesting characterization amongst many in this very underrated movie.",1374019200,3,1118,4.951871657754011
8292831,5,B001DDBDE0,I saw Camp de Thiaroye years ago.  The director - the late Ousmane Sembene - gives us images in his films that we never forget.  African soldiers returning from war on behalf of their European rulers were supposed to get paid - instead they were told just to go home.  Their weapons already turned in - these poor guys stage a protest.  Tanks roll in - inside little glass windows you see white faces operating the tanks that are firing on unarmed soldiers - at no risk to themselves.  I worry now about America's use of drones.  War used to be soldier against soldier.  As terrible as that could be - what are we doing now?,1304985600,11,624,4.327586206896552
8292832,5,B001DDBDE0,"Sembene's films are worth watching for a lot of reasons, but this one is absolutely brilliant.  I've taken several African film courses at University and the professors will show this one without fail.  The story of the Senegalese soldiers returning home from WW2 is gripping enough in itself, but the way they are treated by the French colonizers, for whom they've just fought, is a history lesson that everyone needs to learn.  Whether you're looking for a compelling story or you're serious about knowing the truth behind colonialist exploitation of the African continent, this film should be on your must-see list.",1288569600,15,618,5.099009900990099
