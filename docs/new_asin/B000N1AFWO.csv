8173860,5,B000N1AFWO,"Michael Nyqvist is incredible as ""Benny"" the farmer who falls in love with a city librarian ""Desiree"" after bumping into her at the cemetary.  It's a really sweet romantic 'odd couple' comedy that makes you want to watch it over and over.  You really, really can't go wrong with this one.

Important note.  Not all copies come with English subtitles.  Find out before you buy.  This is a Zone 2 film that plays fine on my PC but not on my DVD player.

PS:  You can watch most of this film on UTube, true, but you miss some really great interraction between the characters because several key 'chapters' are missing.  You are better off buying a copy.",1302739200,,650,4.487179487179487
8173861,4,B000N1AFWO,"I watched this complete movie on You Tube; and even though I didn't know what they were saying, it was still really good! I love Michael. He has the most beautiful eyes.",1301011200,,169,4.3125
8173862,5,B000N1AFWO,"One of the main actors is Michael Nykvist, who also plays one of the main characters in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (movie based on Stieg Larsson's novel by the same name).

N.B.! This is a Region 2 DVD.  It may or may not play on your DVD player, but it is worth trying...
I have been told it will play on a laptop with a DVD drive, or on a game console - like XBox or PlayStation.
I have a regular DVD player - and it plays just fine on mine.  (I bought my DVD player on sale at Walgreens about a year ago)",1279065600,,512,3.811320754716981
8173863,5,B000N1AFWO,"This is a hilarious comedy about two improbable characters who meet while visiting their respective dearly departed. It highlights misunderstandings between city and country people in a humorous, yet thoughtful manner. It is in Swedish, but does have subtitles in English. Highly recommended.",1232323200,2,292,5.813953488372093
