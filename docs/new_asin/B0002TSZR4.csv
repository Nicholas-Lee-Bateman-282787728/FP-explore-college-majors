8096506,2,B0002TSZR4,This learning dvd set is just OK. The set is very dated and some of the actors speak too fast making it difficult for biginers to understand. Some dvd players may not play the dvds.,1385078400,7,181,4.2
8096507,1,B0002TSZR4,"I have bought this 4-pack DVD's for my parents that have recently arrived to US. The lessons themselves are pretty silly with a horrible humor, hurting-the-ears songs, and over-expressive acting. Sorry for such a nasty review, but I'm really disapointed.",1194998400,7,254,5.375

8096509,5,B0002TSZR4,"My wife and I teach English in China.  Her freshman, oral English class is a special challenge as many students have studied but never heard English spoken.

We bought the first DVD and reviewed it before the first class.  I didn't have time to look at it before arriving in China.  OOPS, wish I had.  Now I'm ordering all four.  The first time she used it in class, her 'monitor' (student class leader) said, 'this is the most fun class'.

It's not just the DVD, my wife is a very fun person, but the DVD helped.  We have a new media classroom and this is one of the best resources we use in it.",1128211200,39,596,4.166666666666667
