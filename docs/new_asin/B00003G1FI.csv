1329933,3,B00003G1FI,"What is it with these Pok&eacute;mon? I want to hate them. I want to despise the commercialism. I want to gripe about the cheap production quality. But I can't! Lord help me. I LIKE THE POKEMON!
They're sort of like the  Tellytubbies. Grit your teeth and watch an episode sometime. For no reason  you can pinpoint, you begin to relax. The gentle primary colors soothe your  eyes. You find yourself humming along with the benign little songs. And for  about half an hour, you're not rushing to some pointless meeting, or  hammering out a status report that will be out of date before it gets read.  You're taking a ""time out"" and you're loving it.
The Pok&eacute;mon  are just like that, but in 152 different flavors. Jigglypuff, the star of  this video, is a hybrid of a karaoke diva, the little singing fairies from  Mothra, and Marshmallow Fluff. She's drawn in perfect circles. You know  she's gotta be Mr. Bubble's niece or soemthing. And she sings. And everyone  falls asleep. And in a pouty pink huff, Jigglypuff draws grafitti on  everyone's faces.
That's about it. Really. Simple as can be. Cute and  cuddly and squishy little fluffy monsters, and cute and cuddly little  songs, and... zzzzzzzz...
Oh yeah, kids may like it too. I don't really  know. I don't know any kids.",948153600,,1281,4.707207207207207
7918776,3,B00003G1FI,"I brought over this old Pokemon VHS Tape to watch with the two kids I babysit. It still plays well and clear.

It contains a small amount of short episodes, 3 to be exact, of Ash & the gang's adventure. It goes by extremely fast and contains cute but cheap animations. The voice acting is humorous but obnoxious.

If you are 12 years old or younger, this video should be enertaining. Anyone else should find it hard to be compelled into any of these short stories. While nostalgia did help me find it amusing and cute.

By the way, get ready for some difficult ""Who's that Pokemon"" trivia in the middle of each episode! Too bad there was no Pokemon rap to end this video tape.",1373846400,,676,4.349206349206349
7918777,1,B00003G1FI,"I don't hate this series. I just saw too many shows sickeningly similar to Pokemon. I call this genre the mons. Too many mons.
More originality please.",1023667200,,151,4.62962962962963
7918778,5,B00003G1FI,"Jigglypuff is the most precious Pokemon (next to Wigglytuff) that I have seen (with Togepi and Pika a close 2nd & 3rd).  In Jigglypuff Pop we are introduced to Jigglypuff.  Whom Misty falls in love with and attempts  to capture her.  Only to find out that poor Jigglypuff can't sing.  Misty,  Brock and Ash try to help Jiggly with her singing.  Then Brock finds a  fruit that can cure a throat if it is sore.  Jigglypuff takes a bite, and  voila!  She is singing in no time.  But, Jiggly's lullabye puts her new  found friends to sleep and she becomes a little upset at this.  So she  sneaks into Ash's bookbag and takes out a marker, and begins to give them  all a new facial.  Much to Jigglypuff's (and my) delight.  And of course  our favorite foes Team Rocket try to cash in on the action.  I highly  recommend this to all fans of Pokemon.  You just can't help falling in love  with a little pink balloon-type Pokemon who is a Diva. :-)",962496000,7,940,4.30635838150289
7918779,5,B00003G1FI,"Jigglypuff (Purin in the Japanese language version) is so cool. Just hearing Jigglypuff singing it's marvelous song fills me with wonder and delight. The first episode on this tape is about this wacky paraniod  magician and some Exeggute and Exeggutor. Charmander also evolves into  Charmeleon. The next episode is about a girl who's Paras is so weak that  it'll never evolve. But with some help from Ash and the gang, and Team  Rocket, it ends up evolving into Parasect. Then the final episode on this  tape, is the epsiode of the video's title. A lonely Jigglypuff is seraching  the land for people who can hear her song without going to sleep. It's  absolutly hilarous to watch Jigglypuff put crouds of people to sleep abd  then suddenly puff in it's cheeks and doodle on everyone's face with a  permanent marker. These episodes are really enjoyable and are worth a few  err laughs.",948499200,10,885,4.801324503311259
7918780,5,B00003G1FI,"My son loves Pokemon and he loves the Pokemon ""Jigglypuff"".  When he saw this at the local video store he wanted wanted to rent it really bad.  He loved it and watched it about four times.  I ened up buying  it online and hes still not bored with it!",948499200,3,250,4.040816326530612
7918781,5,B00003G1FI,If you are a Jigglypuff fan (Like Myself)you should Purchase this for you collection. It is Really funny what jigglypuff does to the Gang after she sings. Her singing is so... Z z Z z Z z *gotta catch 'em all* Z z Z z Z,948412800,,219,3.782608695652174
7918782,4,B00003G1FI,"Ah, sweet irony.  A sad Jigglypuff only wants someone to appreciate his singing, but everyone keeps falling asleep.  Even the doofy Psiduck can't stay awake!  Ash has the answer, and soon Jigglypuff puts on a concert in ""The Town that Never Sleeps.""  A great episode featuring my  favorite Pokemon.  The second half doesn't appear to be on the next DVD.
The other episodes include a fake magician using Eggsecutor to hypnotise people, and Meowth falling in love.  All good Pokemon fun.",948412800,5,485,4.91358024691358
7918783,5,B00003G1FI,"C'mon, try to think of a better cartoon character than Jigglypuff.  Can't, can you?  Finally a video that puts Jiggles in the spotlight.",948326400,,136,4.869565217391305
