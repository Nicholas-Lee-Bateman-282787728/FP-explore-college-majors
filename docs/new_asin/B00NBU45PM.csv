6637911,5,B00NBU45PM,"I can't believe they were in the middle of season 3 before I found this series!  Love it!  I've always been fascinated with this time in history, and, after doing some extra reading, although it IS fiction, they are certainly basing it on lots of what is actually known.

Love the cast (Travis Fimmel! oh, my!!) and the story-lines (except for the divorce!! - hated that) and can't wait until next spring for Season 4.  Great show!

6637914,5,B00NBU45PM,"As I ponder the big questions in life: why am I here?  What are my hopes and dream?  What am I searching for?  What would make me happy? it would seem that the answer is always the same: Travis Fimmel.  It is to my profound and sometimes tearful regret that the closest I will get to reaching this goal is watching the TV series ""Vikings.""  Michael Hirst has done something extraordinary in this series with a cast of hitherto relatively unknown actors and a story about a people that have been portrayed to us through history only by those they vanquished, since the Vikings had no writings of their own.  Supported by some stellar performances from his cast mates, Travis Fimmel carries this series and captures the character of Ragnar Lothbrok as an unexpectedly thoughtful and quiet man, driven by curiosity and a desire to expand the experience of the world for himself and his people.  Fimmel is unmatched as a physical actor, with his quirky and sometimes comedic portrayal of Ragnar, and his ability to emote, express and reveal using only his face and body is really quite staggering.  This would still be true, even if he were not so painfully beautiful that I pause the DVD to take stills of him, pausing to wistfully stroke his face on the screen.  While there is a good amount of raiding and some great fighting and plenty of blood, it fits so beautifully into the context of the story that it never seems gratuitous.  In addition to a fascinating storyline and great acting, Vikings treats us to some beautiful landscapes (in Canada and Ireland, now filmed only in the latter), great costuming and some excellent and creative choices in the use of the languages of the time (old Norse, English, French).  Hirst's interpretation of the culture, the religions of the time, and the lives of the people is impeccable.  The only flaw in the whole production is that I am not playing Travis Fimmel's romantic interest, either in the series, or more problematically, in real life.",1438214400,,1987,4.727536231884058

6637922,5,B00NBU45PM,"Great series!  I like the possibilities that are raised as to political situations that might have arisen at the time the Vikings lived..  I was also intrigued by all the possible reasons that the Vikings went raiding.  Wonderful actors and the women characters are strong and independent.

6637925,5,B00NBU45PM,"Received seasons 1, 2 & 3 as a Christmas gift and have been fairly impressed. There are (quite) a few moments that are somewhat uncomfortable, but that's what history and the sagas are all about. All in all a great watch.",1453334400,,221,4.414634146341464
6637926,5,B00NBU45PM,"BONE JARRING, AXE SMASHING SHOW THAT IS ALSO FIERCELY INTELLIGENT, HIGHLY COMPLEX AND VERY WELL WRITTEN.

(I will not mention spoilers) Season 1 begins the rising story of Ragnar and his benefit of a friend in the eery Floki who builds a new style ship that will bring them new glory.  His allies and rivals are laid out, along with the love story between him and Lagertha.  Season two quickly brings to a head the aspirations of his brother Rollo and takes them into direct conflict. Ragnar also pursues his vision of exploiting new areas to the west in Britain.  Ragnar proves his intellect in pursuing multiple strategies of conquest, negotiation and alliance - rather than just bloodshed. Not everyone is on board though. While Ragnar spends extended time abroad, threats arise at home and Ragnar's clan is challenged for their very existence. Many characters that we absolutely love (like Lagertha, Athelstan, and Floki) have jaw dropping developments. We also find that Ragnar's successes are beginning to draw concern and envy of those in power.

For those not familiar with this show yet, it is some of the best written and most dramatic offering on TV, full stop! Those who are not even into history or Vikings have been rabidly drawn into this show. It's just that compelling. It is violent, so if that is not for you, it's best to pass on it. However, History Channel has done an amazing job of weaving true events and both legendary and real characters into a masterpiece of historical fiction. This period of Viking history is pretty well represented in the show as well. The character development is some of the strongest you will see, even in cinema. In fact, the production values in general are equal to top notch cinema. The personalities they construct are absolutely fascinating. Lagertha is about as smart, and savage, and beautiful as any one human being can be. Almost every man who watches this show is in love with her! Floki is so eery and mysterious that he draws your attention every time he is on screen. Travis Fimmel as Ragnar Lothbrok creates such an extraordinary force of personality, I can't even imagine anyone else in that role now. Religious mysticism, political intrigue and deep relationships are just as much of the tale as all the combat.

I like a lot of media, but I have a very high standard for what I consider great. Not everyone will enjoy TV with this much combat. But I can tell you this program has some of the most intricate and well crafted drama to go along with it. It has greatness!",1448755200,4,2538,4.71783295711061
