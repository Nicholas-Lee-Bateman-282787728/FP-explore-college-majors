8198881,4,B000R57W8G,"""Rockin' Road Trip"" is director William Olsen's fun-filled, fast paced romp through the South with the band ""Cherry Suicide."" The sound track alone makes this film worth buying! It's a cornucopia of great alternative tracks that hold up surprisingly well. This film reveals the fun and innocence of that period better than most of its 80s peers.",1197504000,,345,5.0701754385964914
