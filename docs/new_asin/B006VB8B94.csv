8504919,5,B006VB8B94,"Please bring this DVD back into production.  It was wonderful from start to finish, the narration was perfect, the photography was masterful, no matter how much we think we know about LDS history or Joseph Smith, Jr. we learned new things, the spirit was there throughout.  Please re-issue and advertise for sale again on Meridian. I think it will do better than the first issue when Meridian didn't have as many on-line followers.  My Witness of the Light DVD was loaned out and never returned, I know the original had production issues, but the re-issued DVD was fine.  Nancy Lundquist",1396483200,,587,4.84
