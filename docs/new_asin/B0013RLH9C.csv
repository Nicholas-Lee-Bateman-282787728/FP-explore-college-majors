3118881,4,B0013RLH9C,"Just got this little gem of a DVD. The instructor is clearly a ""practice what she preaches"" kind of gal whose sparkling energy leaps out at you from the first moment. She provides a clear, easy, clean explanation and demonstration of the Five Rites. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because like  others who have put out this information, she clearly did not read Kelder's original work - ""The Eye of Revelation"" (1946 version) which tells of seven vortices located in different bodily locations on  rather than the standard yoga chakra references. Moreover the Five Rites are not ever referred to as yoga of any kind but are called ""rites"" since the author didn't consider them to even be substituted as exercise. Nevertheless, the practice of these movements as demonstrated by Dariah Morgan are powerful transformative moves. Highly recommended.",1275177600,12,863,4.986111111111111
3118882,5,B0013RLH9C,"Exceptionally well done video.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow; start now and try to set aside 10 minutes every day to go through the 5 rituals because they can literally breathe life back into you.  As you age these exercises can keep your system charged so you can remain vital unto an old age.  I used to do the yogic Sun Salutation, but these have taken over as my main energy enhancer.  Good job for bringing these 5 exercises to me in a way in which I could learn and benefit.",1275091200,10,497,4.25531914893617
3118883,5,B0013RLH9C,Great product.  I try to use it every day.  Love it.  Must start slowly however and build up muscle tolerance to the 4th Rite in particular.,1270166400,4,140,4.3076923076923075
3118884,5,B0013RLH9C,I bought the book on the five tibetan rituals but was having a hard time figuring out the postures. This DVD cleared it up for me with concise clear visual and audio explanations. This is worth the purchase.,1267660800,6,207,4.473684210526316
3118885,5,B0013RLH9C,"Dr. Morgan conducts a clear and simple yoga session within this dvd.

Whether the viewer is a newcomer to yoga or an experienced practicioner, this dvd is worth the viewing. I have no insight as to whether it is indeed the secret to eternal youth but these simple yoga disciplines are clearly a health benefit to anyone who consistently sets aside time to practice.

The delivery is clear and direct with illustrative examples provided on every warm up and exercise. Stamina, energy and the slowing down of the aging process are all the mission of these exercises.

I applaude Dr. Morgan who took out time to include a personal note with this dvd and the offering of accessiblity to her should I encounter any questions or further instruction needed.

Simply presented, clearly instructed, easy to follow.",1249344000,21,805,4.897058823529412
3118886,5,B0013RLH9C,"I must have at least two dozen workout/TaiChi/ChiKung videos in my collection, and The Five Tibetan Rites is the only one I've ever been able to work with consistently.

Having had major knee surgery a few years back and with very limited space in my apartment, getting into any significant exercise routine has been a real challenge.  But this video is so engaging and non-stressful I was able to get started and stick with it in no time.

And it is effective!  Besides the Five Rites themselves, the warmups alone are a complete gentle yoga routine in their own right which can easily be expanded by simply doing more repetitions, as can the Rites themselves.

Both the Rites and the warmups take minimal floorspace making them ideal for just about any living situation.  And they really do work.  My posture and my silhouette both started to improve after only a few sessions.  The teacher is great and I just can't say enough good things about this program.  Please give it a try, it really is the best thing I've ever found.",1240876800,33,1029,4.640883977900552

But when it came to the five rites, she described how to do them completely different from the book. Then to top it off she only does five of each, not 21.

8252699,5,B0013RLH9C,"I have read Mr. Kelder's book and have been using this DVD and doing the rites daily for several years...I am 73 years old, look much younger, and while I am not running marathons any more, I am in vibrantly good health.  I would tend to take issue with Mr. Doheny's critique, noting that it seems to be the only negative among over 20 positive and appears somewhat hostile and personal.

8252700,5,B0013RLH9C,"Before I discovered the Five Rites, the chronic pain in my lower back inhibited me from walking upright, bending over, sitting still, or carrying anything heavier than a small purse. I thought I would never find relief from the discomfort or freedom from the restricted mobility.

Fortunately, I met Dr. Dariah Morgan and she introduced me to the Five Rites. This simple program has not only increased my stamina and strengthened my core, but more remarkably, I have also regained my flexibility and full range of motion. I can now walk with ease and even dance in my high heels, a feat unthinkable before I started the Five Rites.

The Five Rites poses are so easy to learn, and take as little as five minutes to do, but the results are immeasurably restorative!",1302652800,8,763,4.7293233082706765
8252701,5,B0013RLH9C,"Since age 50, I have been practicing the Tibetan Five Rites and at age 63,I feel younger, look younger, and act younger than I did at 50. I have read the books and was so glad Dr. Morgan created this DVD. The added warm ups are an extra perk that has made my body more flexible. This DVD has made a great gift for my friends and family and has been an inspriation in my life.  Thank you. Dr. Morgan for taking the time to create this DVD to demonstrate the Tibetan Five Rites.",1302480000,7,476,4.0638297872340425
8252702,5,B0013RLH9C,"Dr. Morgan presented the 5 Tibetan Rites at a business networking luncheon I attended about 5 years ago.  I began practicing the rites the next morning and have done so almost every day, since.

The practice is magnificently vitalizing, builds and maintains flexibility; stands alone or interfaces with other practices; and is easy to commit to because it takes minimal time for positive and ongoing results.

Dr. Morgan's DVD takes the rites to the next level.  She guides students young and old, new and veteran, to achieve overall success with savvy tips and healthy routines.  Dariah's sincere dedication and compassion are inspiring. The DVD is an excellent resource to refer back to, time and again.",1302393600,5,705,5.095652173913043
8252703,1,B0013RLH9C,"Years ago I read Peter Kelder's book, and also purchased a video tape (now out of production, unfortunately), and have been doing the the five Tibetan rites ever since.  I don't know where Dr. Morgan learned the rites, but what she's doing (most especially in regards to breathing) is NOT what is taught in the book.  I also don't know (nor does she explain) where she gets all her warm up routines (which comprise a major portion of the DVD), as they're also not ""in the book.""  Dr. Morgan is certainly enthusiastic about what she's doing and teaching, but it must be done PROPERLY to get results.  Since she states she's been doing the rites for many years (20+ years), it's obvious that the rites are not doing what they're supposed to be doing (and which they do for me, and others who perform them properly), because she looks every bit her age.  [I'm not saying that to be offensive in any way... I'm just stating a fact.]  It's very easy to learn to do the five Tibetan rites from reading Peter Kelder's book.  Please... buy the book and learn to do them properly... gracefully (which takes 15 to 20 minutes per day... NOT 10 minutes)... and skip this DVD.",1289433600,44,1163,4.5095238095238095
8252704,5,B0013RLH9C,"This DVD deserves 5 stars. If you're serious about learning the five rites, this is as good as it will get.
I'm 53, in good health and have been doing the rites for about three months now. I can see and feel the difference.
What I like about this DVD is that it was professionally done. Every exercise is explained in complete detail from the
breathing to proper body alignment. It starts out with about 10 minutes of introduction about the rites.
There's warm up exercises, and the movements are shown exactly how to be done, with alternative movements in case
you can't do any of the rites until you build up to them. Dr. Morgan speaks at a good rate of speed, is precise and very
clear. She takes you through the rites, and also shows a class going through them. This is the way instructional videos should
be. I've never met Dr. Morgan so I'm writing this from my own personal point of view. I seriously doubt you'd find a better
video than this. I'm doing the 21 reps of each rite, and people who haven't seen me in a while have commented how good I look.
I'm surprised just how powerful these movements are. I do Tai Chi, rebounding and stretching on a regular basis.
Adding this to my exercise program was the best thing I could have done. I would find it hard to believe that someone would
not like this video. It was made for woman, but it doesn't matter. The rites are for both genders. This is the DVD you want.
Great job Dr. Morgan. Thanx!",1279670400,11,1451,4.338235294117647
8252705,5,B0013RLH9C,"I really liked this DVD, the warm ups and the rites are all presented in a professional format.  It got me starting my practice real fast. The video is easy to follow and its already beginning to make a difference in my life.  I highly recommend this DVD - you won't regret it.",1277510400,8,277,4.2075471698113205
