8610961,1,B00EZVD86I,"That's fine to create history, but everybody knows that Attila is buried at an unkown place. There's a theory saying he was buried under a riverbed, at some river of central/east Europe. Simply impossible to find him. Really have to tell I hated this movie.",1391990400,,257,4.733333333333333
8610962,2,B00EZVD86I,"The first six minutes of this Asylum adventure gives us a pseudo history of Attila the Hun, who found Moses' staff that will raise the dead, give riches, and grant immortality. After he finds the staff, he breaks it in three pieces and hides them because...he can. The U.S. military finds the third piece in Eastern Europe guarded by Attila's dead son. When push come to shove, the SON who is depicted on the DVD cover, comes to life and grunts and kill things. He is capable of withstanding CG bullets, CG grenades, and a CG bazooka. Much of the film is consumed with a group of military men hunting said son in the woods getting themselves killed. The ending was as f-upped as the rest of the film with the final battle of grunting warriors causing me to scratch my head. I would venture to say the film is called ""Attila"" because it marketed better than ""Revenge of Attila's Dead Grunting Son.""

This is not a film for series or semi-series viewers. Asylum fans might like the silliness of the film. In one scene they pry open a wooden crate. Once they pop it loose, they open the lid and you can hear old hinges squeak. There were no hinges.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1387497600,8,1189,4.4495412844036695
