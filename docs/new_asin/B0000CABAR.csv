1916107,5,B0000CABAR,this movie collection I bought for my husband for christmas. it is a collection for people who love clint eastwood.,1199664000,,115,4.8
1916108,5,B0000CABAR,"The movies sell themselves. However, they are not the first in the ""Dirty Harry"" series I was trying to find as a set. It was as close as I could come to it. I had a hard time finding these the way it was. I'll have to purchase ""Sudden Impact"" seperately.
This was also the best price I could find on the web from a reputable source. Fast delivery. Very Satisfied.

Thanks Amazon!!!!!!",1183161600,3,385,4.273972602739726
1916109,4,B0000CABAR,"When you figure that all these movies go for about 13-15 dollars each elsewhere, it's a good deal.  Individually, the choice of movies is odd.  While the first two Dirty Harry movies are the better of the series, and entertaining, the psychological horror of tightrope almost feels misplaced.  Perhaps Dirty Harry, tightrope, and another non-dirty harry copy movie would have been better.  Regardless, the movies themselves are all good, and worthy of purchase.",1177286400,3,461,5.273972602739726
1916110,5,B0000CABAR,"If you are a ""Dirty Harry"" fan this set is a must. wonderful. I wish more of the movies were on DVD.",1171843200,2,100,3.590909090909091

This is good stuff anytime.,1263772800,,308,4.065573770491803
7998323,3,B0000CABAR,"I had never seen these movies before buying this collection. The stories were Clint Eastwood in nature, but I didn't realize that they had all that nudity in them, that wasn't nessesary to get accross the themes. Probably would not have got them if I knew.",1259539200,,256,4.586956521739131

7998325,5,B0000CABAR,"I mainly bought this DVD box set for Dirty Harry, the first R-rated flick I got to see by myself when I was a kid in '71. (I'd been turned away from Play Misty For Me earlier that year.) Eastwood's and Andy (Scorpio) Robinson's acting was so intense, and Lalo Schifrin's music was so ultra-cool, that I sat thru the film twice.

I'd seen this three-pack in stores but never picked it up because there's absolutely no info (full-screen? widescreen? features?) printed on the box. Turns out, the Dirty Harry DVD is 2.35:1 widescreen with lots of extras, including a vintage short and a new 30 min. documentary with cast, crew and fans (Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Milius, etc.).

Magnum Force (1973) is 2.35:1 widescreen, and Tightrope (1984) is 1.85:1 widescreen.",1200355200,13,762,4.8538461538461535
