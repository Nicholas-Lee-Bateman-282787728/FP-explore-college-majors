6928326,2,B00RDEITYU,"Terrible, disjointed film. I really wanted to like it, given Brittany Murphy was in it, and I find her to be a talented actress whose loss was tragic.

But this film was a huge disappointment. It's edited, written, and directed chaotically, and frankly many of the actions of the characters make no sense, in the plot, or even physically, in the scenes. In addition, the filmmakers did a remarkably bad job of explaining, in the film, who was who. The characters' reactions to one another made no sense in many places, and their actions made even less sense. The more ""twists"" they tried to throw in, the worse the film got.

All in all, this is a b-movie in a blender. I can only guess this was the director's first film, or that he (or she) was not coordinating with the screenwriter and the editor, and not watching the dalies on-set. I ended up sitting through this only to find out if I was missing something, or just not ""getting it"" but nope, it's just a bad movie. And it's certainly not a horror film. Thriller, maybe, but horror? No.",1426550400,4,1043,4.484210526315789
6928327,5,B00RDEITYU,"Fun, entertaining popcorn thriller. The cover makes it seem like a horror but it's more like a younger, sexier ""Fatal Attraction"" than it is ""Paranormal Activity."" If you're a Brittany Murphy fan, you'll enjoy seeing her in her final role. She does a great job as the sister of the main character (played by an excellent Shantel VanSanten). Brittany's character is sympathetic and kind. It has a really surprising ending that half the people in my theater seemed to hate, while the other half loved (I was in that half). It's not a bad way to spend an evening relaxing as long as you don't have more expectations than just being entertained.",1426464000,2,641,4.732142857142857
6928328,4,B00RDEITYU,Saw this movie on the big screen. The character building is a bit confusing in the beginning. The ending however makes up for it. Loved the scenery and storytelling. I had the pleasure to meet Brittany Murphy on set. So sad she passed at such a young age. This DVD will be in my library as soon as it's released.,1426464000,5,312,4.216666666666667
6928329,5,B00RDEITYU,"""Something Wicked"" is both a murder mystery and supernatural thriller that will not disappoint fans of either genre! A great cast and great performances will have you guessing (probably the wrong guess) until almost the very end as to who did what and when. To top it off, are there really ghosts coming back from the dead or are they just imagined? A great date flick, too.",1424822400,14,374,4.597014925373134
6928330,4,B00RDEITYU,"I liked this movie and I thought it was a great last one of her movies for her to be remembered by. I still remember her from her younger days but this movie was well-done, in my mind!",1465948800,3,184,3.8684210526315788

6928340,5,B00RDEITYU,"Wanted to see Brittany Murphy's final movie. Brittany was good in her final role, but looked kinda sickly. This movie throws a lot of curves, and keeps you guessing.  Brittany is not the main character in this movie, but gets a good amount of screen time here. A good horror movie that would make a good addition to any collection.",1446336000,,331,4.516666666666667
6928341,2,B00RDEITYU,"At first it seemed like a ""made for tv"" movie, then the f word was used & that clarified that. It was confusing , one of the reasons I wanted to see it was because Brittany Murphey was in it,( her last movie), the scariest thing really : when Brittany looked in the mirror the medicine cabinet & was taking pills in the bathroom, I thought to myself, that was where she was found too . Could have been so much better, Medicare. As for the protagonist, was she possessed, had the accident really scarred her emotionally, or was she mentally ill? ??",1446249600,,547,4.320388349514563

6928365,4,B00RDEITYU,"I absolutely love horror movies and will give every single one of them a chance.  This was pretty good, not really scary, more suspenseful and dramatic than scary.  I still enjoyed it and would probably watch it again.  Brittany Murphy looked bad in this film, and I think she was probably already sick when she filmed this.  I always liked her, and it's such a shame to have lost her so young.",1436313600,,394,4.430555555555555
6928366,5,B00RDEITYU,Very suspenseful and devious,1436140800,,28,6.25
6928367,1,B00RDEITYU,"I watch a lot of bad movies for fun but ""Something Wicked"" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen.
After learning that it was filmed in Eugene (where I live) I was pretty excited. However within five seconds of  listening to the simpering, meek male lead (a wretchedly miscast John Robertson) I knew I was in trouble.
Where to begin? There is ZERO chemistry between anybody on screen. It's like everybody is in a different movie.
The story is rediculous to the point of stupidity. The film presents itself as a taught, psychological horror movie but fails at every single turn to create any kind of tension or suspense. I won't spoil the ""twist"" ending (though I would seriously be doing you a favor) but lets just say that right when you think it couldn't get any dumber OMG IT GETS SO MUCH DUMBER.
And poor Brittany Murphy... she looks just awful. Rail thin and twitching uncontrollably, this was Murphy's final film before passing away 5 years ago. If your a fan of of the departed actress avoid this movie. Seeing her like that just makes me sad.
In the time I've had an Amazon account I have only reviewed two items, inclding this movie. I hate this movie sooo much. I could go on for a thousand more words about how very, very stupid this movie is but I have already spent way to much energy on this cinamatic pile of soiled diapers.",1435968000,,1345,4.489795918367347

6928372,3,B00RDEITYU,I think Brittany deserved better than this as her last movie but such is life. She is always remembered fondly and it wasn't her acting that was so bad. The story had promise but it just wasn't well executed.,1434067200,,208,4.358974358974359

If you can watch the movie til the end and not have your skin crawl as one by one people are done away with in clever and convoluted ways by what I can only call evil(or insane) genius, I'm surprised.  Maybe because it actually has an clever if insane villain and not just Jason hacking down people with an axe that this movie hasn't appealed to some of those who watch the horror gendre.

Too many unexplained characters and jumping  from one to another was a bit confusing. It felt like it ( the screenplay) came from a disconnected mind and was not very captivating. I don't recommend this rental. Being a fan of Brittany Murphy, it kind of made me sad that this was Brittany Murphy's last role.",1427760000,,427,4.271604938271605
6928401,3,B00RDEITYU,"Arc Entertainment serves up another slice of thrills and chills with the suspense thriller Something Wicked. Touted as Brittany Murphys last performance, it delivers through deliberate psychological missteps and a lingering dark sense of dread that leaves the viewer wondering if all is what it seems. Although its not quite up to par with most theatrical releases, it deserves a status a few notches above the Lifetime and TV-movies category it will no doubt be lumped into.

In Something Wicked, a young couple makes their wedding plans shortly after the death of the brides parents in a tragic car collision with a train. As they settle into married life, gruesome secrets from their past collide with the present.

Something Wicked achieves what all movies should aim for. It gives audiences a distraction from real life for over ninety minutes through a series of ups and downs and loops and sharp turns that any fan of suspense thrillers will enjoy. I had my suspicions of what might happen in the end, but it didn't affect the level of entertainment I experienced along the journey.

Something Wicked is rated R for violence, sexuality, and language. Although there are a few sensual moments that get a little steamier than what we see in made-for-TV movies, thats really the only thing that would push this into R-rated territory. Things never go overboard in the areas of violence and gore.

Brittany Murphy shows great emotional depth as the tortured sister-in-law of the lead character. She switches from grounded psychologist to a helpless, crazed, and empathetic shell with the sense of professionalism you would only hope for in a much more seasoned actor. I don't know whether it was for the role or not, but her greasy slick-backed hair and pale features matched her characters agonized and mentally drained personality.

Something Wicked is the equivalent of a Lifetime movie if production and the budget were taken one step further. One or two good twists and a big lie by omission fuel this suspense thriller. A cast who are invested in their characters lends a level of quality to a film that successfully rises above what could have been just another direct-to-DVD casualty. It acts as an acceptable tribute to the late Brittany Murphy, who turns out a fine performance in her last role.",1427673600,13,2308,4.953488372093023
6928402,3,B00RDEITYU,"The film opens with a car being hit by a train while a scarecrow watches. It then flashes back to one hour earlier, then 10 minutes later it brings us up to the same point, making this flashback rather useless, other than to set up a flashback near the end.

Christine (Shantel VanSanten) is going to go to Oregon University. Unfortunately her parents were killed in said train accident with her boyfriend behind the wheel. An incident at Oregon U. involving being pushed into the pool turns into a who-dun-it before the first killing.

Suspects:

Christine is not mentally well and may be hallucinating or have a split personality.

James (John Robinson) is her mill worker boy friend. He doesn't want her to go to college in fear of losing her to some rich frat boy.

Bill (James Patrick Stuart) is her creepy uncle who spies on her, even while in the bathroom getting dressed. Apparently Eric Roberts was too busy doing cameo roles to accept this part.

Susan (Brittany Murphy) is Bill's wife who can't have children. She is a confidant to Christine, but has her own mental issues.

Ryan (Julian Morris) is the creepy son of the mill owner (Robert Blanche) who dreams about having sex with Christine...and sawing his missing mother at the mill.

The film drops clues. In fact it is inundated with clues, but leaves out one important piece of information for the clues to make sense. This comes at the very end as a way to say, ""see how clever we are?"" The problem was not the clever script, but how it was presented in a non-entertaining fashion. The dialogue was boring. The characters were stock. More akin to a Lifetime film than a horror flick.

The title does indeed come from the phrase ""Something wicked this way comes,"" but that title was already taken and this film had nothing to do with that one.

Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. Butt nudity with thong.

SCENE SPOILER: In one scene Christine leaves a shower and her clothes are missing. She has a towel wrapped around her. She gets pushed in the pool. The towel stays wrapped around her, even as she climbs out of the pool. As she leaves, she is clearly wearing panties as the panty line shows through the wet towel and we can also see them from the front. She was taking a shower, I assume naked and not wearing panties. Her clothes were stolen...I think you know where I am going with this.",1427587200,,2350,4.558194774346793
6928403,3,B00RDEITYU,Not up to expectations ... Also very far ditched,1427500800,,48,4.444444444444445
6928404,2,B00RDEITYU,"I watched this movie with enthusiasm because Brittany Murphy starred in it (she was such a cutie). Unfortunately, it is a real let down. The story is disjointed with snippets of scenes thrown together. Nothing about the movie earns the title of a thriller - certainly not a psychological thriller - nor deserving of the money spent to watch this film.",1427500800,2,351,4.770491803278689
6928405,4,B00RDEITYU,Pretty good. Good twist.,1427414400,,24,5.25
6928406,1,B00RDEITYU,"Completely nonsensical thriller begins with an accident that takes the life of a young woman's parents but spares her and her fiance, a young man her mother didn't approve of.  The movie jumps forward a year and Christine is going to college and living with her creepy older brother, a police officer who follows her around and spies on her when she's undressing and his pill popping psychologist wife played by an unconvincing Brittany Murphy, looking very much like someone in need of an intervention.

Someone is stalking Christine and writing cryptic Shakespeare quotes on mirrors and car windows that only she seems to see.  Someone is also killing people, but seemingly for no particular reason.  Is Christine crazy?  Is her clingy fiance maybe a little more creepy than romantic?  Why do Christine's older brother's service weapons keep disappearing?  What about the pervy dude who goes to the same college as Christine and whose father owns the mill where her fiance works--conveniently his dad also happens to be seeing the previously mentioned pill popping psychologist played by Brittany Murphy and he's concerned that his son might be violent and dangerous and a very bad influence on his little sister who might be a bad seed.

I imagine the people behind Something Wicked watched Wild Things and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane late one night while extremely stoned and decided combining them would make one heck of a movie--they were wrong.  Something Wicked not only makes virtually no sense but all of the characters act suspiciously or crazy or both because the filmmakers evidently thought it was a good way to keep viewers off balance--or at least it was easier than coming up with a script filled with plot twists that actually make sense.

Something Wicked does embrace its awfulness with a lot of energy and enthusiasm which makes the movie significantly less painful to sit through than it could have been but bad is bad and Something Wicked is really and truly something awful, although it's probably a movie that improves after a few hours of heavy drinking or drug use.  Don't be surprised if the RiffTrax people jump all over this one--Something Wicked's only possible value is as something to be mocked and ridiculed.",1427155200,9,2243,4.9388297872340425

8694941,4,B00RDEITYU,"So right off the bat I will say that because you can't do have stars, This really is 3.5 and not for stars. It's good but not great when you get to the middle of my review you will see why it states that. I did a lot of research on the moviev and the only reason I bought this instead of renting , was because as advertise on the box and in several commercials except except the one on Amazon.com , this is BrittanyMurphy's final project she ever worked on for film. So right away off the bat, I am going to say to find it very odd that it was released five years after her untimely death. Now , does that make this movie bad , due to the fact abandonment , DeadAlive and her made-for-TV lifetime movie Nora Roberts tripping were all released right after you and then I would say year to 18 months. ? Yes . .

 The film is decent , it could've been better . However, I did very is the information on Amazon I. E. information/trivia , they had to finalize anything and complete the film. From what time lowness are part of the film seem to be done nothing seems to be missing . Also she was excellent and that her part my phone was very well done and she was the highlight of the field and probably the strongest actor. I'm changing it on as if she had not passed away and not whether the fact that this is her final piece of work sway my opinion considering I have seen everything she has done since her decline high-profile balls like happy feet,  sin city, don't say a word and 8 Mile feature films stopped in she was getting more independent and direct to video films towards the end of her career.

 So back to the film . The movie is about a young couple announcing to the girls parents that they want to get married and start a life together, have kids etc. . The parents have an issue with that at the dinner they are having in the restaurant , make it well-known girl is having bad judgment, and should focus on school and ditch the boyfriend . They then leave dinner I cannot remember if it's all in one car or two separate cars . That does not matter they lived together and end up getting in a car rack and the parents of the daughter can't kill. It then cuts away to a year later the daughter is being stalked/haunted by someone or something while her older sister played by BrittanyMurphy and her creepy brother in law are living with them. Death and murder and sloughs and you don't know who is causing what and what is happening until the end of the bill. That's all I really want to say because I don't want to give them away. I will say Britney Murphy gives a very chilling and creepy performance, you have no idea if she is a good or evil character and Julian Morris is also very good in this building. He also can pull off American accent or role very well. Since this is the first film I've seen him play in American character instead of a British one because both the other films I've seen him in which both directed by Jeff Wadlow cry_Wolf and sorority Row he never lost his accent for those movies. Just in case that matters to anybody. The other girl in the movie i've seen her in other films, I don't know if it's just what they have, or brittany Murphy died during production of this bill for what the reasons were relieved was poorly acted at times four the lead actress. But there are just certain hallucinations/nightmare seems that it just terribly done. There are scenes that are supposed to be things like visual there for a dramatic psychological aspect , And there's caught a ways like to ring romantic scenes and other night there sequences of characters that are just poorly executed but if you can look past that the film is the fourth getting checking out because it is a Murphy's last wrong and she didn't deserve to pass away the way she did . Which I think in the 2013 findings in the test results that would read time is. Sad and obvious that she didn't died naturally . I'm going to write up the top just like I am at the bottom right now this really doesn't deserve 4 stars deserve 3.5, but on this rating system you can't team half stars so it's good but not very good",1502496000,,4113,4.221092757306226
