3430636,3,B0019APR7G,"This is ""the kind of movie you'll like if you like that kind of movie"". A lot of symbolism. As a fan of Viggo Mortensen and Jennifer Rubin I enjoyed their performances, but I couldn't really help wondering at certain points what was going on.",1359590400,3,242,4.4
3430637,3,B0019APR7G,"I got a different message from the movie than was advertised. It seemed to me that it was simply a stylized version of the meaningless life that many people live. I would have prefered that the sexal intercourse scene had not been included. We already had the message that all was not perfect in that area. If not for that, I would have shared it with my kids.",1252713600,8,360,4.3088235294117645
3430638,1,B0019APR7G,"I only bought this because I love Viggo Mortensen, but it is a strange movie and I have watched it twice and still don't get it. But does not stop me from buying more of his stuff. He's easy on the eyes.",1241395200,4,203,3.857142857142857
3430639,3,B0019APR7G,"Director Lech Majewski titles each scene with a Biblical word in his very surreal movie set in the California desert observing a couple whose marriage is disintegrating like a sand castle on a beach.  Religious allegory abounds here-the creator is a strong black man, there is an obligatory crucifixion, etc.

Made in 1994, this is the sort of movie a serious fangirl might want to ferret out! Typical early Viggo choice-edgy, intelligent, witty script and other excellent actors.  However, I bet it didn't get much of a run in the theatres and if Mr. Mortensen hadn't gone on to play Aargorn, I doubt it would have ever been released on DVD!",1236643200,20,642,4.7657657657657655
8273160,4,B0019APR7G,"Not quite sure why this movie has stuck with me the way it did. It is perhaps better suited to an off broadway stage than a film. Its quirky. Its sometimes difficult to understand the allegory, and at other times the message hits you directly in the face. The ongoing scene where Wes is undergoing a hopeless surgery, only to have the doctors walk out in the middle of the operation when its discovered he has no insurance, is particularly timely.
Viggo isn't Harry, btw.  He's a victim of Harry, and basically his entire world. He plays the part well despite some of the scenes being somewhat overdone in their delivery.  It alternately makes you want to cringe a little or laugh out loud, as in the timing of 'the bomb'. All the acting is solid. The story is solid. The dialogue intentionally mundane. And I will never think of sand in the same way again.",1502064000,,857,4.487179487179487

8273162,4,B0019APR7G,"Although this movie is rather depressing & surreal, the saving grace is the two gorgeous stars! Viggo Mortensen was impeccable in his role as usual.",1461715200,,148,4.96
8273163,1,B0019APR7G,I could not even watch the first 30 minutes,1427328000,,43,3.888888888888889
8273164,1,B0019APR7G,would put a negative if I could.....terrible.,1406678400,,45,5.571428571428571
8273165,1,B0019APR7G,"Not my type of movie.  When I put it on my wish list I was not sure what this was about, but found out in the first fifteen minutes it is not my kind of movie to watch.",1404864000,,168,3.4210526315789473
8273166,5,B0019APR7G,"This movie... I think I'm going to be spending years trying to unravel all of the subtle mythology and metaphors wrapped within blatant social criticism of consumerism, politics, apathy, and dear god so much more. I'm a huge fan of Chuck Palahniuk's ""Fight Club"" and have seen it many times, appreciating the darker look at how we are and behave as humans in society. But while Fight Club is quite literally a punch in the face regarding these issues... The Gospel According to Harry is the literal grit of sand in your teeth regarding the same issues Fight Club addresses as well. It's more subtle and it lingers... abrading and annoying yet you can't get get it all out of your mouth. A punch is a punch, the pain subsides.... but I'm going to be trying to get that sand out of my teeth for years from this film.",1404432000,6,814,4.469798657718121
8273167,1,B0019APR7G,"Gotta love Viggo but this movie wasn't one of his better known movies - ah well, actors got to do 'out there' stuff... Only watched it 'cuz Viggo was in it.  Tell you what, I'll write a screenplay called ""The Gospel according to Viggo"" and have him outshine Chuck Norris!",1376956800,5,271,4.42
8273168,1,B0019APR7G,could not sit thru it .hated to see Viggo in this twisted I don't know what to call it .,1368489600,2,88,3.45
