The story itself can be a bit confusing and slow to follow, mostly attempting to build suspense. I noticed at quite a few scenes that I became bored with the plot so I'm sure they could have shortened it to only 3 discs to keep the intensity high. Even though, I still highly enjoy the story about this crazy hospital and all of it's staff enough to watch it more than a few times. I would recommend to any Stephen King fan or horror fan.",1385337600,,586,4.104347826086957
