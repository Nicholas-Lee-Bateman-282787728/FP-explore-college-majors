6401614,4,B00K2OBRQU,"You know, not bad. I'm always skeptical with low budget films. This one actually has good acting through out. Cool story line, decent effects (considering), and a very twisted ending. Worth the effort to sit & watch.",1484006400,,216,4.864864864864865

6401617,3,B00K2OBRQU,"Here we go with another government project which went awry. Is this where all our tax money goes?

A group (task force) is sent to an island off the Canadian coast to retrieve the survivors of Project 48.  Unfortunately, as we know from the prologue, only one member is alive and he won't stay that way long.  Having stupidly left their raft sitting on the beach in the surf, the team is now stranded because the tide took it away so they now have to contend with the ""monster"" while they await rescue and get picked off one by one.

That's about it. There's a saboteur, of course, and a lot of unexplained things, such as why so many oil-dripped crows are found implaled on the beach and at the camp.  And why the monster can't come onto beach soil.  Perhaps the most bizarre thing is an Asian-American army office with a distinct Southern accent. Now that's a novelty! The ending is the usual twist which has come to be not so usual any more but actually expected.

This film wasn't really scary and I had a difficult time finding any character to gain a rapport for and that always makes for difficulty in enjoying any film. Even the titular ""hero"" wasn't exactly likable though at the end, he deserved a little sympathy.

After reading the review by Mr. Lim, I have to say that when someone involved in the production of a film writes a review denigrating it, it had to be downhill all the way after that. Nothing worse than having a creator give his creation a thumbs down. Watch it if you've some spare time to kill.",1427328000,2,1522,4.410714285714286
6401618,2,B00K2OBRQU,"This is a 2010  film being offered up at Redbox. The film opens on Dark Island as ""test 48 did not go as planned."" The island was used to test bio-fuel by Altracorp, which also has military applications, wink wink nudge nudge. A group of people are assembled to investigate the lost contact with the island.

The bio-agent is a CG black smoke which we see early and often. It really isn't scary. As it turns out everyone on the crew is not who they claim to be, which made the film on the inane side. A twist is fine, but please tie it into the beginning, drop a clue or something. Too bad they didn't make Tuck, the bar drunk, a secret company agent.

The dialogue is rather plain and the characters cycle from lame to too much testosterone.  Poor use of eye candy. One girl unzips her suit, claims she is going to shower then the camera changes scenes. What was that all aboot? Is this film Canadian or what? Oh wait. It is Canadian.  Okay I understand now.

6401619,2,B00K2OBRQU,"I produced this movie. It's not so great, but I learned a lot about movie producing and got to spend some time in beautiful British Columbia. Overall, thinking about this film generally gives me warm feelings, so I won't be hurt if you don't buy it. It's just kind of strange to think about how mediocre and forgettable this film turned out, considering the insane amount of life-experience earned sleeplessly from all of us behind the camera.
It's really weird for me. Here it is, a DVD release, finally, after four years from the film's completion. My life has sped away from the 23, 24 year old boy that produced this film. To me, buying this DVD, I'll always have a strange little vanity, a snapshot of my life at the time; but you'll all have a schlocky genre film. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Indeed.",1404086400,16,821,4.554054054054054
8655408,3,B00K2OBRQU,"It wasn't a horrible movie, just could of been done abit better...
The acting was good, and bad at times...
The story was a little repetitive, scenery was exceptional.
(One thought normally don't you take the same path when walking thru a jungle, just so you don't get lost?)",1517788800,,275,4.63265306122449
8655409,2,B00K2OBRQU,"I didn't see the ending coming...buuuuuut aside from that the whole thing was a 1/2 arsed Lost wanna be...minus interesting characters or interesting back story...or mystery.  Acting was functional, plot was predictable, effects were a thing...",1488240000,,244,5.777777777777778
8655410,4,B00K2OBRQU,"Eric Lim sold himself short in his own review.  Everyone is their own worst critic, I suppose.  I found the concept fresh, the acting good, the SFX very good budget considering (especially towards the end), and the directing above par for a SyFy.  I recommend taking the time to watch this, ""bioweapon gone bad,"" thriller.",1487376000,,322,4.818181818181818
8655411,3,B00K2OBRQU,"Meh, two and a half stars on a generous day.  The acting was adequate but the unimaginative black cloud flying around devouring people didn't do much for me.
