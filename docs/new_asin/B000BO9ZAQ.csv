8305373,4,B000BO9ZAQ,"Nomuken is hilarious!  This video is great to begin your understanding of drifting techniques and to have a few laughs.  It's not as long or in-depth as Tsuchiya's Drift Bible, but has very clear explanations of techniques for building a drift car an driving one.  It's short, to the point and funny.  Check it out!",1227657600,,315,4.672727272727273
