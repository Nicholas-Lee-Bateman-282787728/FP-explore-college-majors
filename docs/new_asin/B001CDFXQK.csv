adding cardio into it, LOVE it even more! I added my own little touches, to keep it interesting! I still like
Shaun T. better!",1351036800,2,237,3.6666666666666665

First off, I don't think anyone should think they can exercise for only 10 minutes and see results. The idea of a 'quick fix' workout could certainly be effective with, say, muscle toning exercises designed to work on specific areas. But quick fix cardio? Nah. It's pretty widely agreed that you should have an elevated heart rate for at least 30 minutes to burn any calories or fat. With that in mind, I think if you're going to do this DVD, you should do all three segments together, giving you a total of 30 minutes.

That being said, learning three incredibly complex dances in ten minutes each is downright impossible. They give you what they call a 'lifeline' move, a sort of simple move that you should do if you ever lose your way in the choreography. Were I to follow that advice, I'd be doing nothing but the lifeline the entire 30 minutes on the first try.

The first time I attempted this workout, I gave up after about 5 minutes. The moves are too complex, and they run through it so fast, you just can't pick it up quickly. You just end up sort of flailing around, trying desperately to follow them and getting 90% of it wrong anyway.

HOWEVER. One day, I popped this back in the DVD player, determined that I was going to 'conquer' this workout. I had to keep rewinding back in two minute segments, at least 3 times for every single move, and doing it over and over and OVER again until I could passably do the move. Repeat, ad nauseum, for every single one of the 10-12 moves that are in a single 10 minute dance. FINALLY I could do the first dance without looking like too much of an idiot. And you know what? It was actually fun! Once you get the moves down, it's really enjoyable. But the rewinding and learning process really, REALLY sucks. You have a certain sense of accomplishment once you've learned it.

So, if you're looking for a challenge, and don't mind banging your head on a wall 80 times trying to learn the thing, pick this one up for some fun dance moves. If you're just wanting to sweat for 30 minutes without much 'rubbing the head while patting the tummy' type choreography, try something else.",1246233600,6,2211,4.422604422604422
8287074,4,B001CDFXQK,"There is no step guide in this DVD but Juliane does show you several times (but a little too quickly) how to do the moves.  This DVD moves a little faster through the routines than another DVD I purchased but I do like it. I will have to review it several more times before I've ""got it"" but it is interesting, fun, funky and does burn calories. You are more inclined to exercise if it is fun, and this DVD does make exercise fun.",1239408000,6,430,4.119047619047619
