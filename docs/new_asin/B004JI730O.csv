8431881,3,B004JI730O,"This movie was released in theatres with Roberto Benigni speaking Italian and Walter Mattau speaking English - the movie had the appropriate subtitles- that version is extremely funny. The online versions are either only in English or only in Italian both with subtitles. That is the reason for a 3 on 5. The theatre version of this movie was the funniest thing ever, unfortunatley these unilingual releases takes away from the movie. Since we can't appreciate Benigi and Mattau conversing in their own languages at each other. So if you have not seen this movie before it is still a very nice picture.",1485475200,3,602,4.854368932038835

8431886,1,B004JI730O,"I was very disappointed when this product arrived. When I purchased the item, there was no indication that the Blu-ray disk was zone B and would not work on my player. I have been trying to get ahold of this movie for more than twenty years, and now that I have it, I can't watch it... This is regretable, hands down, it is the funniest movie that I have ever seen.",1332892800,9,365,4.154929577464789
