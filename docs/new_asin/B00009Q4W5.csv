7992661,5,B00009Q4W5,"Big Business is probably the best movie that Laurel and Hardy ever made.  There is only one plot, unlike most of their films, and they build it grandly.  Their silent films were I think their best with heavy reliance on the visual.  After Big Business must be Two Tars.",1381449600,,269,4.448979591836735
7992662,3,B00009Q4W5,"A good selection of the top stars from the era of ""Slapstick"" and silent films.
I found the clips themselves mildly amusing and my kids laughed out loud a few times but I can't imagine adding this sort of film to my collection. Historically, it has it's place. Entertainment wise, well there is a reason we developed ""talkies"" and ""color"".

I would mention that I am baffled by those who complained about the music.
The music accompaniment was well done and completely appropriate for this genre of film. I can only assume that those who complained had never before viewed a ""silent"" film from this time period.",1328227200,,611,4.710280373831775
7992663,5,B00009Q4W5,"I watched these shorts on Netflix and intend to order this DVD collection. All are very entertaining, but ""One Week"" is one of the funniest shorts I have ever seen. In an age prior to stunt men, prior to animation, and prior to CGI, this film is a major achievement.

Apparently some of the reviewers here have so little sophistication as to be unable to discern musical genius. I expect that they cannot comprehend anything that doesn't adhere to the normalcy of pop music. I'm sure they are equally unable to appreciate Berloiz or Zappa.

But The Alloy Orchestra is able to mold melody, style, disonnace and rhythm, and the universe of instrumental sounds to convey the story line, the emotion and the appropriate background sounds of these films simultaneously. I think these masterpieces all benefit markedly from the loving care applied to the modern soundtracks for these priceless films.",1318291200,2,894,4.953333333333333
7992664,1,B00009Q4W5,"Music accompanying silent movies should not be annoying, and certainly shouldn't sound modern. The Alloy Orchestra completely ruins these great films with their cacophony. ""Big Business"" and ""One Week"" are absolute classics, but, in spite of an excellent visual experience, this DVD went straight to the second hand shop. I will wait until these films are presented with decent soundtracks before I add them to my film library.",1299196800,,427,5.294117647058823

CONTENTS--

BIG BUSINESS--  Laurel & Hardy as Xmas tree salesmen get into an escalating war of destruction with an annoyed customer. As a crowd gathers, Stan and Ollie trash Jimmy Finlayson's landscaping and bungalow while Jimmy destroys their merchandise and truck. Police officer Tiny Sandford observes the action and calmly takes notes.

CHASING CHOO CHOOS--  Monty Banks short was edited from his feature, ""Play Safe."" Monty rescues a girl from a gang of thugs; she and the pursuing bad guys hop a freight train. Monty catches up to it by using a fruit peddler's horsecart and a racing car; the gang chases him across the tops of the cars. Includes some impressive stunts by Banks (and others).

EASY STREET--  Cop and ex-vagabond/thief Charlie Chaplin rids Easy Street of thuggish Eric Campbell. The bad guy escapes from jail and kidnaps Edna Purviance, but Chaplin triumphs again. The infant seen briefly is the son of directer Erich von Stroheim.

ONE WEEK--  Newlywed Buster Keaton bungles the assembly of his pre-fab house. Keaton's first-released solo short is one of his very best.
