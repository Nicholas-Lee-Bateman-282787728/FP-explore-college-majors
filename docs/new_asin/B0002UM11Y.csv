2120508,5,B0002UM11Y,"I bought this DVD for my grand daughter who is very much into Curious George however, my mistake, I did not look at the Zone area and this dvd is for Zone 1 and it will not play in Australia pity because she would have loved it.",1168646400,,228,3.872340425531915
2120509,1,B0002UM11Y,"Based on the cover I thought I was getting a cartoon insted it was an old version. The other thing I do not like is Geore is only in one of the ""3"" on the dvd. I feel I got a raw deal, the cover is very misleading. It costs almost as much to return it so I guess I am stuck. Make sure you know what you are buying!",1165363200,4,314,3.5
2120510,1,B0002UM11Y,"Poor George cries about 4 times during this hospital episode, and my 2 year old could not help but cry right along with his favorite character - too sad to rewatch. The next 2 episodes were not sad, but really scary - Mouse Soup is about a little mouse who is running for his life, and Boris Gets a Cold is about germs that attack the poor moose (and features a really scary germ sequence). Maybe better for older kids? - Why bother - there are so many better movies out there to choose from!",1120089600,10,492,4.189473684210526
2120511,5,B0002UM11Y,"This fun and colorful DVD will be sure to keep your children entertained with three different stories contained on it.  The first story is Curious George Goes to the Hospital.  George's curiosity once again gets the best of him in this fun adventure.  George mistakes a puzzle piece for candy, and the piece ends up getting stuck in his stomach.  Soon, he's taken to the hospital by his friend, the Man in the Yellow Hat.  Once there, George meets many new friends and gets his troublesome puzzle piece removed, but not before running into more mischief.

Next is Mouse Soup.  A hungry weasel has caught a mouse and plans to make mouse soup, but the mouse proved to be trickier than the hungry weasel bargained for.  The singing crickets are the highlight of this story.

The final story on the DVD is called Morris has a Cold.  Morris the moose has caught a cold, and, with the help of his bear friend, he's able to get better quickly.

This DVD is excellent for young children.  My 6 and 4 year olds loved each story, especially Curious George.  I highly recommend this great DVD.  Each story is loads of fun, and your children are sure to enjoy each one.",1118016000,9,1157,4.5
2120512,2,B0002UM11Y,"While the Curious George portion of this video is ok (my daughter loves it).  The other stories are downright morbid and creepy.  They gave me nightmares, let alone my kid.  I don't understand why such weirdness was lumped together with something as wholesome as Curious George.",1111536000,11,278,5.0
2120513,5,B0002UM11Y,"I bought this DVD and am not at all disappointed.  It was enjoyed by a 2 year old and enjoyed by a 10 year old.  Cute, silly, and well done.  Curious George's story is so true to the illustrations of the book.  Brings it to life.  In mouse soup, the voice of the Mouse is Buddy Hackett. I highly recommend this for a relaxing viewing that is clean.  The Mexican singing crickets can be laughed at over and over.  Makes me want to look for more productions directed by John Matthews.",1110412800,3,482,4.230769230769231
2120514,4,B0002UM11Y,My daughter is nearly 3 and loves the books about curious george. This DVD is a hit and she watches it over and over and never seems to tire of it. Highly recommended.,1110153600,2,167,4.090909090909091
8032046,4,B0002UM11Y,"I've had this DVD as long as I can remember, and I can remember watching it all the time when I was feeling bad and it always made me laugh. I liked all three stories on the DVD, and honestly I'd have to say I liked Mouse Soup and Morris Has a Cold better than I liked the Curious George video. I was drawn into those two more because it incorporated humor and songs into them, which I think children would enjoy with their visuals. But it will probably vary based on your child.

I would recommend looking up these shorts on the DVD to make sure you agree with showing them to your children first, though, as some visuals can be a little disturbing. You can find Mouse Soup and Morris Has a Cold on Youtube with a simple search. Please be sure to watch them first before introducing them to your child.

All in all, I think this would be a great choice if you'd like something to entertain your child if they're sick, or if you just want something with a mix of real life and fantasy with some humor mixed in.",1515888000,,1010,4.174358974358975

8032050,5,B0002UM11Y,"My grandchildren (ages 3, 7, 10) LOVE this DVD! They watch it over and over, and never seem to tire of it. I first found it on a sale rack, and didn't realize what a gem it is. Now I'm buying a replacement copy, since the original copy has somehow become lost. They all like the Curious George story, and they love the other short cartoons just as much. It's great entertainment.",1234742400,3,379,4.277777777777778

He was a great fan.  It helped him realize that he shouldn't put things in his mouth - and he repeated this phrase numerous times.

Morris has a Cold is HILARIOUS if you like puns.  It became Josh's and my private joke ""Just like-a, just like-a, just like-a me"".  It is truly funny for both adults and children - I also got a copy of the book out of the library we liked it so much.",1224115200,,665,5.355769230769231
8032052,5,B0002UM11Y,If your Child Loves George they will love this and if they don't know George yet they will love him. I remember George when my kids where little and now I had my Grand kids watch him and they love him also.,1214697600,,206,3.9285714285714284
8032053,1,B0002UM11Y,This is NOT a cartoon and my kids did not enjoy it. The look on the cover is that of a cartoon and until you take of the wrapping(thereby voiding your opprtunity to return it) and play it you wouldn't know that.,1206576000,,211,4.0476190476190474
8032054,3,B0002UM11Y,"I had brought this for my 21 month nephew cause he would see the monkey on other things, but this is a clay people, and not a real cartoon, so he really doesn't watch it.",1204761600,2,170,3.8857142857142857
8032055,3,B0002UM11Y,"we only wish there was more Curious George on this disc.  My daughters are not interested at all with the two extra shorts on this collection.  I myself do not care for them.

So, my 3 star rating is just for the George part of the disc, which in OUR opinion, was fantastic!!  It follows the book exactly which made my older daughter so happy since the hospital story is one of her favorites.  This is not a cartoon, but an early 1980s film with ""Rudolph the Reindeer motion"" - and it is simply adorable.  We watched it over and over again hope to find more Curious George stories by the same production group.

Highly recommend it, again, ONLY FOR THE CURIOUS GEORGE SEGMENT!",1179014400,3,676,4.403225806451613
