6135843,5,B00H7BJ1I2,"My family was excited to see they were releasing volume 1 and 2 of Rawhide's seventh season so soon after we bought seasons 1-6, but the price was kind of a heart break. UNTIL I stumbled upon the series at my local Wal-Mart. Both Volume 1 and 2 available for $19.98 each.

TL;DR
If you're dying to complete your collection, check Wal-Mart. Otherwise I hope Amazon will get with the program soon and drop the price for y'all.",1394064000,,424,4.435897435897436
6135844,1,B00H7BJ1I2,"I have enthuseastically purchased each season 1-6 as they were released but, refuse to pay this much for season 7. It is rediculous for Amazon to charge $90.00 for season 7. I am a loyal buyer of many classic TV shows and love Rawhide as my favorite western but, will wait until someone at Amazon acquires some semblence of common sense and prices this item  in line with previous seasons or just forgo purchase. Volume sales is more profitable than ""screwing"" loyal customers. Do NOT buy this season and send Amazon a message to have more respect for customers like myself and fans of classic TV. Shame on you Amazon.",1393804800,5,618,4.618181818181818
6135845,1,B00H7BJ1I2,"This is one of the great series of the Golden Age of TV -- that said I gave it ONE STAR because the price is WAY OUT OF LINE. $90.00 for the complete 7th Season is OBSCENE!! No other complete season cost anywhere near that! Complete Fifth Season is $45.51 and Complete Fifth Season is $51.35. Perhaps the person at Amazon in charge of pricing goofed. If it is not Amazons fault then the producing studio wants to gouge (""screw"" would be more apropos) fans who have consistently bought each season. The price for the complete Season Seven needs to be adjusted SHARPLY DOWNWARD!!",1390262400,13,577,4.5576923076923075
6135846,5,B00H7BJ1I2,"Season seven is the last real round-up for Rawhide, with the cast we've come to know through the years, who continue to put in fine performances. After an absence of three plus years, Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) returns, making this season extra sweet. The DVD cover art certainly should have pictured him, along with a better photo of Eric Fleming. Mr. Fleming's characterization of trail boss Gil Favor is the real reason to watch Rawhide, and has been what has brought me back to CBS for each successive volume I have purchased. Year after year he put in the most versatile acting, riveting the viewer into the plot, as he punched the stories through. Mr. Favor had the best life of any of his drovers, with side stories involving his daughters, and he improved any scene he was in. Season eight, by comparison, is a stampede; all the regulars except Rowdy, Wishbone, and Quince, were jettisoned; the camaraderie, gone. But to enjoy one of the best western TV series ever made, you cannot go wrong with this volume of Rawhide.",1386633600,16,1026,4.705555555555556

6135863,5,B00H7BJ1I2,"The 7th Season was the last Season with Eric Fleming as the star. Late in the 7th season Endre Bohem took over as the show's producer. His episodes were easy to spot, because Sheb Woolly returned in the 9 episodes that Bohem produced. Also three scripts were recycled in the 7th Season. 'Texas Fever' used the same script as 'Incident of the Running Iron' from the 3rd Season. The 'Violent Land' used the same script as 'Incident of the Valley of the Shadow' from the 1st Season. The 'Calf Women' used the same script as 'Incident West of Lano' also from the 1st Season. If you are a Rawhide Fan, this is a must. It marks the final appearance of Eric Fleming and without his talents the show would be canceled midway through the 8th Season.",1426723200,,740,4.448529411764706

6135883,5,B00H7BJ1I2,"I used to always watch Rawhide.  It wasn't my favorite western, but I enjoyed it.  Now, all these years later, I realize that it was much better than I thought.  After seeing the onslaught of sleazy ""reality"" shows lately, I treasure the old westerns for the gems that they were.  Rawhide always had lots of action, and the actors---both the regular cast and guest stars---were really convincing.  There was more of a plot in each episode than can be found in a whole week of current programming.  The only drawback to these episodes of Rawhide is that they were filmed in black and white.  Even so, they are well worth watching.  I'm glad I bought them.",1404086400,,654,4.577586206896552

6135886,4,B00H7BJ1I2,"I enjoyed Rawhide's 7th Season vol 2 pretty much, but noticed that a couple of the episodes were like copies of earlier season's episodes.  That was a little disappointing, but I still enjoy watching the best western show of that era.  It's the last season that ""Gil Favor"" and some of the other regulars were in the series, so it was worth watching for sure.",1397088000,5,359,4.507692307692308
6135887,1,B00H7BJ1I2,"Great nostalgia for the rich retired folks. Poor retired folks need not apply.

Rawhide plays on TV for free these days, and you can get an over-the-air antenna on Amazon for forty bucks by Terk that pulls in more free Rawhide channels!! 70-80 dollars for oldie TV shows that, to the best of my knowledge, ol' Clint doesn't get to see dime from, is ridiculously over priced.. Only season one is a deal. The volume splitting is horrible. The show was profitable and successful in the 50s-60s. Some other tv show dvd sales suffer this same high priced volume scenario. We get sucked into season one for 15 dollars and then the dollars and volumes start amping up to 70-80!

So if no one is getting paid, where is the money going? Tv studios are the only entities still surviving from this golden age to reap the rewards. They have generally have no one to pay but themselves. The original producers are gone too. I love watching these these old shows and IMDBing the actors. Not many of them from the fifties and sixties are still with us. Too many smoked like chimneys and lived to fifty. If you read where many of them spent their final days, it was in the Los Angeles area actors retirement homes. I assume they did not have the luxury of getting paid any further than the few bucks they got paid for the movie or tv shows at the time. Today, you make a hundred episodes of anything, you are a megamillionaire retiring in Beverly Hills with a hospital full of nurses..

Clint was lucky to live long enough to make movies into the age of residuals and dvd sales to collect what he isn't getting from these dvds. If I'm wrong, and someone is still alive to collect some cash for acting here, let me know. What am I really paying a high price for, if no one associated with Rawhide is getting a nickel.",1395792000,3,1800,4.3993993993994

6135890,5,B00H7BJ1I2,"I just bought both of the Season 7 volumes at Walmart tonight for $19.96 each.  That's less than half of the price it is being sold for here on amazon.

Rawhide is a great classic western TV series and long-term fans should be able to buy it at a reasonable price.  If you live within driving distance of a Walmart, call them and ask if your local store has this in stock, and the current price. It could be worth driving a few extra miles vs the current price of $44 here on amazon.

I am really surprised amazon has not discounted this DVD release.

UPDATE - 6/22/14:  Walmart no longer has this set in stock.  Amazon still has the price way too high. If you want to buy this, you probably will be better off waiting until later in the year, or next year, as the history of the prices on the previous sets has been a substantial discount after a year or more.  As far as the content of the DVD itself, the video quality is excellent, and although some of the episodes in Season 7 are unusual for Rawhide and not up to the standards of the prior seasons, overall it's still strong material you will want in your collection.",1394236800,9,1124,4.244131455399061
