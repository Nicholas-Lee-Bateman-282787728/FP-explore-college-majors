7869034,4,630438565X,"It's not a great film, but if you love the more accalaimed Merchant-Ivory films, you'll find this neglected one well worth watching. It's  lovely to look at, dry and sophistcated, and makes a few potent points about Americans in Europe, either blissfully ignorant of the culture, or desperate to plunder it. It's billed as a Mechant Ivory film, but in this case, James Ivory only co produced it. Ismael Merchant wasn't anything like the director that his partner was, but he did make some very interesting films, like Cotton Mary which he co directed with Madhur Jaffrey. The cover art here is so wildly inapprorpriate, that its laughable, and the print isn't 2.35.1 as it should be, but a transfer direct from television, which is a shame, because it's a lavish looking film. I enjoyed it, but it's not for the shoot 'em up crowd, that's for sure. Check out Ismael Merchant. He sounds like he would have been great fun to be around!",1413936000,,933,4.689024390243903
7869035,2,630438565X,"A perfectly awful film in the typical Merchant Ivory boring-but-stylish mode. But for the presence of the incomparable Jean Moreau and the stylish-ness of the interiors and exteriors (Madeleine Castaing's Paris apartment etc etc), it rates the two thumbs down category. As a comic relief,don't fast forward the scenes that include klutzy Sean Young (tripping about in spiked heels and mini-skirt)who in a truly forgettable scene is whisked away to the dance floor to perform a tango so clumsily executed as to cause Rudolph Valentino to turn over in his grave. Another low-point is the odious musical scene with her would-be lover played by Josh Hamilton. Then there's Nell Carter, hamming it up as the devoted servant. Did Jean-Marie Besset and George Trow, who wrote this trite, ridiculous screenplay,laugh all the way to the bank? This might be ok to watch on a lazy summer afternoon with a Campari and soda on hand. The combination will bring on a well-deserved siesta.",1026518400,2,973,5.049689440993789
7869036,1,630438565X,"This film was so bad that I could not stop watching it it - Iwanted to see what trite, overworked movie cliche would pop up next. I laughed my head off in the the scenes where I believe the intent was for the viewer to be sobbing his or her head off.  The only excusable actor was Sean Young: we already know how truly terrible she is.  But for the rest of the cast to come down to her level - shame on them.
This is currently tops on my list of movies I love to hate",957225600,3,467,3.804123711340206
7869037,4,630438565X,"In his book, The Films of Merchant Ivory, Robert Emmet Long says that The Proprietor is not a perfect film and details some of the blurring that distracts the viewer, particularly a rather quick metamorphosis by Sean  Young's character.
He does however add that the film is likely to become  a Moreau classic. I will agree with him, but want to add that this film  seems to be such an achievement, a collaboration of so many talents, that  the end product could not help but be rather wonderful.
Jeanne Moreau is  pefectly cast as Adrienne Mark, the famed French-American novelist and I  can quite easily see how the role was tailored around her inimitable voice  and expressive face. The character seems wonderfully complete, perhaps  because of the many individual talents involved in the project who seem to  have done a wonderful job collaborating.
The rest of the film is equally  wonderful. There is some breathtaking photography of Paris, several  wonderful scenes of a French auction and a wonderful incorporation of  Madeleine Castaing's apartment.
This film goes far beyond what Hollywood  is capable of. It takes all of these wonderful elements and incorporates  them (on a shoestring no less) into this film which is almost as much a  painting, a collage perhaps, as it is a work of fiction.",953424000,17,1303,4.912844036697248
