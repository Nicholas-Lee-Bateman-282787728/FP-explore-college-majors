8677304,5,B00NBU469W,"Very nice selection and renderings of beloved Verdi arias. Also, everything with a very italian flavor, singers, productions and orchestras. A disk not only to watch but just to listen to.",1417132800,,188,5.096774193548387
8677305,5,B00NBU469W,"I enjoy these aria discs for times when I want to experience something other than an single opera. They permit the enjoyment of multiple works via the excerpted parts, including the actual vocal work, as well as the staging. While they are enjoyable on their own, they also work as a ""filter"" in making buying decisions on entire operas. all of the excerpted numbers are good, with some being more so than others.

The excerpts from Rigoletto, Traviata and Forza put Blu ray editions on my shopping list, while the excerpts from Don Carlo, Aida and Otello had an opposite reaction.

But for 2 hours of nonstop Verdi at pretty high levels of excellence, this is hard to beat. Picture and sound are superb, especially the latter in HD MA mode.

Smart shoppers can do much better on price though, although some Amazon sellers are getting more reasonable for what is, in reality, a sampler disc.",1416182400,2,891,4.698717948717949
8677306,4,B00NBU469W,"A compilation of  Verdi's best-known opera arias, from the Tutto Verdi set. As the source productions are live rather than studio recordings, a few of the transitions are abrupt and the backgrounds change.
For that reason I felt four stars more appropriate than five.

Most pf the singers are not well known outside of Italy at this point, with the exception of Nucci and Dessi. The level of singing and orchestral playing is high. One of the premises of the set is that the operas are presented in manners and houses that would have been close to what Verdi had in mind, with a few exceptions.

Most of the productions were staged and recorded at Teatro Regio Parma as part of the Verdi Festival Parma, and the aural perspective is similar. For a few of these I preferred to shift over to the stereo soundtrack for a little more clarity. The difference is not drastic, but the pickup for La Traviata was different from the other productions.
This is a good way to get a feel for the series and a handy set of popular Verdi arias. I could easy come up with a second disc of arias more skewed toward the early and less popular operas that would be just as engaging and entertaining as these.
This disc is well worth having, especially if offered at a promotional price.",1413676800,6,2200,4.422885572139304
