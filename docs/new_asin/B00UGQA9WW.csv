8706311,1,B00UGQA9WW,"As a fan of Warren William I had to check out SMARTY. The following review is for that movie alone, I didn't watch MERRY WIVES OF RENO.  Beware, there are also spoilers ahead.

A divorce and marriage to Horton ensues, devastating Warren but not Joan, who treats it all as a lark.  As expected (if you've ever seen a movie), when Warren finally gets over it Joan, bored with wimpy (did he ever play any other kind of role?) Everett, plots to get him back. Blondell actually gets Horton mad enough to slap her to move her plan along. At the end, after they make up she baits him again and he slaps her. This time though she's happy, because he's proved to her that he's a ""real man!""  To quote Stangeland; ""did I mention this is a comedy?"" Originally titled ""Hit Me Again,"" one of the pressbook's suggestions to exhibitors was to plant a newspaper article titled ""Most Women Need A Good Sock Once And A While!""  Filmed just after the Production Code went into effect, trying to get the idea across that Blondell ""gets off"" on physical abuse would have at least been tackled head-on during the Pre-Code era.

8706312,4,B00UGQA9WW,"Not burned on M-DISC.  Instead, they used the old-fashioned, obsolete DVD-R that last only about five years.

With M-DISC, you could expect a 1000 year lifetime.  I would've gladly paid two dollars more to have these movies burned on M-DISC.

The movies themselves I liked, good video, and audio quality, 4.5 Stars.",1458604800,3,315,5.0

8706316,5,B00UGQA9WW,"I love the set of movies starring Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell, and that includes Merry Wives of Reno. It's light entertainment to be sure, but it's very comfortable and amusing. The second movie, ""Smarty,"" with Blondell but no Glenda Farrell, is also entertaining if somewhat bizarre. You can't go wrong with this DVD. BTW, there's a Blondell/Farrell movie out there that isn't available yet; ""Kansas City Princess."" If anyone in power reads this, please make that movie available.",1406764800,9,486,5.1645569620253164

Joan Blondell never looked better than she does in the little black dress she wears in a good part of Smarty.
Guy Kippee is very funny in Merry Wives of Reno.",1318550400,8,227,4.3023255813953485
