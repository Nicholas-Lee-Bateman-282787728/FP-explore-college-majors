Being that I reside in the US, I purchased this DVD as Region 1 and recently noticed that all that was available now of this DVD is Region 2 (Europe, etc.) as it is an import. IF you can find this DVD as a Region 1 and are interested in the band, I would not pass it up as I believe this DVD will be eventually hard to find and perhaps very expensive if/when you do find it. It is an excellent DVD.",1398384000,,502,3.9313725490196076

The energy that Slipknot has at this show was just incredible. Every Slipknot Fan should have this! Great vocals, great songs and very intense performance. Pick this up and you won't be disappointed :)",1387929600,,345,4.323076923076923
