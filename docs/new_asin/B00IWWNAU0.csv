6301635,5,B00IWWNAU0,"The long sought after 90's TV movie Summertime Switch finally (and subtlety) arrives to DVD. This is the first time this movie has ever been officially released on any format, it was never on VHS and never got a DVD of it's own, so us fans will have to settle for this 8 movie set. I was just pumped to finally own it and get to see it again. Great movie involving a spoiled rich kid and a juvenile delinquent with the same name getting mixed up a bus pick up. The spoiled kid ends up at juvenile camp and the criminal kid ends up at the rich camp. Both make friends they would have never otherwise associated with, and go through a summer of insanity before everything culminates in a big camp vs. camp basketball game. Starring Boy Meets World and Cabin Fever's Rider Strong and the great Jason Weaver. Also look for roles by Richard Moll (Night Court, House), Barry Williams (Brady Bunch) and Patrick Renna (Sandlot, Big Green, Etc.) as great villain Modem. This is not what critics would call a ""quality film"", but it is fun, memorable and I know a lot of people have wanted to see it for a loooong time.",1395705600,7,1108,4.357487922705314

8645879,5,B00IWWNAU0,"I have been wanting a copy of these movies for a loooooooong time. I could never find it anywhere. I was so excited to see it available on Amazon. The quality isn't HD, but nothing was HD back in the day. The transfer quality is as best as you can expect. I have bought DVDs that looked like it was a recording off of a TV. This is not the case here. It was made very well and has closed captioning.",1471392000,,399,3.9382716049382718

8645882,4,B00IWWNAU0,"To echo a previous review, the release of Summertime Switch to dvd was extremely subtle. In fact, looking at the other 3 films included on the dvd, none of which I am familiar with, I would go so far as to say that the film is far from cult status and the only reason to buy this 4-film volume is to finally own a long overdue copy of Summertime Switch.

The only reason I am as familiar as I am with the film is because I grew up in Jacksonville Florida where the film was shot and I even stole some screen time as one of the basketball players at the climactic scene's basketball game (uncredited role). That's my 15 minutes of fame. I eagerly anticipated the film's premier on tv and for years after was frustrated that I could not own a copy of the film on VHS. Instead, the film would appear once or twice every summer on tv without any fanfare to accompany it. In short, this film, for the most part, was very much lost in the 90's and for much of the 2000's. It's a glorious day all these years later that I can finally own a copy of the film.

As for the film, it's an amusing summer camp version of The Prince and the Pauper, where an upper-class kid is mistakenly sent to a summer punishment camp and a troubled youth is sent to a ritzy summer camp. Both kids learn valuable lessons along the way. Even in these tv movies for kids where the morals and morales are spoon-fed to children, there is still a couple of powerful moments. Off the top of my head, the one that comes to mind is when one troubled youth teaches Rider Strong about basketball.

But it's a bit of a shame that this film is so forgotten, because this film was brimming with potential. Most people familiar with this film recall that the star, Rider Strong (Shawn Hunter from Boy Meets World) was challenging Andrew Keegan and Jonathon Taylor Thomas as the teen idol of the times, and appeared on the cover of many of the Tiger Beat-esque magazines of the early/mid 90's. He does a fine job in this film, and his portrayal as a snotty rich kid is quite believable.

The real sweet and sour of this film goes to Jason Weaver though. Jason Weaver co-starred with Rider Strong in this film as the other Fred Egan III, and he steals the show. If you recognize his voice, it's because Jason Weaver is the voice that sings ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" in the Lion King animated film by Disney. Hard to believe after all this time that many still think that Jonathon Taylor Thomas was the voice of Simba AND the singer, but Jason Weaver is on the soundtrack credit. Close your eyes during the scene in Summertime Switch where Jason Weaver is singing and you just might hear it.

After the film premiered, seeing Jason Weaver co-star with Rider Strong and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court) as well as Patrick Renna (The Big Green) I had figured that Weaver had his foot in the door to doing other film and/or a Michael Jacobs tv show. In terms of talent and look, Weaver was spot-on and I enjoyed every second of him in Summertime Switch. Rider Strong may have been the bigger star in the film (at the time) but he is outshined severely by Jason Weaver.

NOW IF THEY WOULD ONLY RELEASE AIRBORNE ON DVD, MY LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETE!",1433548800,,3205,4.3156146179401995

8645885,3,B00IWWNAU0,"I love Summertime Switch! It had been one of my favorite growing up. I also enjoyed Phantom Town, but I wouldn't classify that as a family film. I think it was too scary for that. I enjoyed watching the ""Our Gang"" episodes. Gooby was a weird, weird movie. I did not enjoy it.",1413072000,,275,4.2075471698113205
