5194258,5,B008YYBYKE,This is a wonderful compilation of one of the late night horror host pioneers.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to relive some fun or learn about a great period in local tv history.,1358553600,8,188,4.371428571428571
8532805,5,B008YYBYKE,"Those lazy days of Sacramento in the early 70s (and late 60s), when on either a Friday or Saturday night (yes, Wilkins' show was on Friday nights as well) when the droll humor filled friends of the family with forward thinking ideas of child rearing, let this young one stay up to watch the likes of ""The US Navy Versus the Monsters"", ""Crack in the World"" or some kaiju import in the form of Godzilla or Gamera, the giant flying rocket turtle who battles monsters from outer space who want to ravage Tokyo and Japan's country side.

As a young one I never got Bob's very dry wit until, to be embarrassingly honest, until much later when I was in college, long after he had passed the torch to John Stanley.  But friends of the family seemed to have intimate knowledge of the man and his show, and when I was at their house would let me stay up to watch what I could until I fell asleep.  It was here that interestingly enough I discovered and loved science fiction, and really didn't understand the horror genre in spite of the fact that Bob's show was mostly about horror films.

""Attack of the Mushroom People"", ""Destroy All Monsters"", ""Godzilla versus the Smog Monster"", ""Cat Women on the Moon"" and a number of others.  Horror and scifi are often allegorical, but back then I just saw them as simple adventures.  And you know what?  Thanks to Wilkins, in spite of my greater insight into visual media, I still see these films as simple adventures, and again, thanks to Bob Wilkins, will always have an appreciation for scifi and fantasy films of ages past.

Bob would do local spots, notably for Miracle Auto, and would do his interviews, his stint as Captain Cosmic on KTVU channel 2, as well as being the master of ceremonies for the either the first or the second Star Trek convention in Sacramento at Sac State (maybe College Greens ... I can't remember).  I was there though, watching him live in the theatre do his thing as the Star Trek blooper reel ran as well as a costume contest and a few jabs at the then new Space 1999 TV show.

Where Bob's Miracle Auto spot of transforming a beat up VW bug into a Lincoln Continental Mark Five are not on this disk, his animated spot for Toyota is, as well as few clips of other TV spots he did.  And of course, the skill with the candle and stogie coming out of its mouth are shown sitting on the table next to Wilkins.

Extremely fond memories.  Scifi, and I guess horror, are forward thinking genres with a degree of intellect that is at times subtle, and other times either isn't there or is just in your face.  Anzilla the Fire Monster, Queen of Mars, Angry Red Planet and more.  As I sit here in my office chair watching this DVD, I recall those calm, quiet, hot nights in the San Juoquin Valley in Suburbia Sacramento, not thinking that this local program would be rememberd by anyone for any amount of time.  It was just another local low budget TV show with a bit of an odd bent.  And that once it was done, that would be kind of it.  A fond memory that only the oddballs who were fan of the scifi-fantasy and horror genre would recall.

But lo and behold, here has this disk loaded with some great footage and highlights as well as an interview of Bob's career as the host of Creature Features.  Incredible stuff.

I'm sorry to say that I had a chance to see him some years back before he died at the Oakland Coliseum on Halloween night, but figured I could always see him again the following year.  I had forgotten he had been suffering from Alzheimer's, and was tragically heart broken when I heard of his passing.  All those spots for the now racially strife ridden Arden Fair shopping center, all those cigars, the Giant Chicken Hawk, his exceptionally calm smile and demeanor, and plain sense of delivery, from KCRA and KTXL in Sacramento to KTVU at Jack London Square, Bob brought to us scifi and fantasy fans different Golden Age of 1970s and 1980s television that I think most people across the nation and the world over will never understand.

But thanks to digital media, he is now forever preserved in this very heartfelt treasure DVD compilation.  All those times I went to Raley's, all those times I cruised down Watt Avenue, all those times rafting down the American River, all those times at Cal Expo or at the park and Zoo, Bob, for me, brings back those wondrous times.  Of all those rare scifi films that I've managed to acquire from across the globe, I think this is my most treasured DVD of them all.

Definitely worth the very inexpensive price.  And, as Bob would say, ""Until next time.""",1511568000,,4570,4.453781512605042

8532808,5,B008YYBYKE,"As a ""monster kid"" of the late 1950's and early '60's, watching this helped to bring back memories of seeing many of the classic Universal, Hammer, and American International science fiction, horror, and fantasy films in the theater and on television. I'm from the New York/New Jersey area so we had a horror host by the name of Zacherly who introduced many of these films in an off beat and comedic style that captured the attention of the monster film loving general public (mostly comprised of kids of course) almost immediately. I see from watching this video that it seems that the same held true on the West Coast as well with this gentleman who even though he was not attired or made up to look like a ghoul, vampire, etc,etc, he still was able to maintain a certain flair , a particular style that proved to be just as interesting and entertaining for the fans of this genre....",1483142400,,886,4.578616352201258
8532809,5,B008YYBYKE,"I grew up with Bob Wilkins on Saturday night at 11 p.m., my mother would make us go to bed at 9 p.m. My brother and I would wait till we could hear her snoring before grabbing a towel to stuff under her bedroom door so she couldn't see the flickering lights of the tv screen. We would turn the volume down so low (so we wouldn't get caught!) that we had to put our face almost glued to the tv screen. He would sometimes have a double feature and we would fall asleep and mom would get up and find us asleep with the tv on. She would shake us awake and make us go to bed and we would be in so much trouble the next day, but it was worth it! We looked forward to it every week and loved the thrill of not getting caught. The trivia for each movie and the interviews were well worth it. I totally miss it, and at family get togethers we still talk about it. The funny thing is, my older brother and sister rarely joined us. It's a memory that my brother and I share. I wish they would have the DVD's of each movie Bob introduced and all of the trivia and interviews. THAT collection would be an awesome collectors edition I would sell my grandmothers house to own!",1466812800,2,1161,4.03030303030303

8532812,5,B008YYBYKE,"Being a longtime fan of early horror and cult movies, I had heard of Bob Wilkins, but since I was from nowhere near Northern California I had never seen any of his material. It was my loss. This DVD is an 87-minute treasure trove of cult film paradise. Between 1966 and 1981, Bob hosted over 1,800 movies (!) on his show, and this feature takes you across the breadth of that massive body of work with clips, trailers, stills, audio and video snippets, and vintage interviews with the likes of Boris Karloff, John Belushi, the great William Marshall (a fine actor and singer perhaps best remembered for his roles in ""Blacula"" and ""Star Trek"",) and the incomparably prolific man of horror himself, John Carradine! This is a great introduction to Bob Wilkins, its only fault being that it's too short. The titles profiled read like a shopping list of B-movies from days gone by (I was astounded by how many of them I had seen) and the information provided is interesting to true fans of the genre. Wilkins' good humor shines through and it's immediately obvious why he was such a beloved fixture on California television.",1411084800,5,1119,4.714285714285714
8532813,5,B008YYBYKE,I really liked this DVD. Gave a lot of very good information on the show.  Lots of interesting interviews.  Definitely worth buying.,1383436800,2,132,4.954545454545454
8532814,5,B008YYBYKE,"It's hard to appreciate some of these horror show hosts, because so often they were seen just briefly as one tried to catch a show
(and fend off other family member's viewing preferences).  I never saw this particular one, but Bob Wilkins was charming and had a dry but
good-spirited sense of humor.  Particularly interesting are his interviews with several stars, including one with the criminally underrated actor
William Marshall (now known mainly for Blacula, but a serious actor for most of his career).  He also interviews Christopher Lee and Donald Sutherland,
and even has one brief gag he set up with Boris Karloff!  The entire movie is a montage of images from the movies he introduced and also small clips from the program.  Very entertaining for those who grew up with such shows and for fans of horror and b-films everywhere.",1359936000,15,838,4.873239436619718
