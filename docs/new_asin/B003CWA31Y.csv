8414629,5,B003CWA31Y,"Such an entertaining film/documentary about steelhead, fishing and river camping. I dream of a trip like this. The videography is excellent.",1450828800,,140,5.714285714285714
8414630,5,B003CWA31Y,Good content and great video quality. Story line was interesting wanted me to do the same trip I'm too old.,1391817600,,107,4.4
8414631,1,B003CWA31Y,"What a serious let down. It was filled with some of the most uninteresting footage I've ever seen.
The video was more about their camping/logistics than about the fish.
When the first guy that catches a fish admits he hasn't cast to a steelhead since 2001, it explains why it takes 3 days for an entire team to land their first fish.

Granted, we are spoiled these days with fish porn DVDs, but I felt these guys were just trying to cash in on the trend.",1247443200,3,454,4.27906976744186
