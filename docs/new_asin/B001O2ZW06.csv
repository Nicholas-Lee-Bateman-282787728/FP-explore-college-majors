3726355,2,B001O2ZW06,"I really tried to enjoy the ultra-low-low-budget film, WET KISS, but found it excruciatingly dull. The premise of a traumatized little girl, growing into a devastated, homeless woman, is interesting. She is befriended by a man named Pete, who tries to help her. Unfortunately, Pete's friends are all idiots, and the woman winds up dead. This leads to her return from a watery grave, and revenge by ""drowning"" her victims on dry land. The idea is great, but the execution is drawn-out and hideously boring. The extra star is for the finale, which is OK...",1367884800,7,554,4.842105263157895
3726356,5,B001O2ZW06,"I'll begin this review by admitting to a personal bias...I love independent films!

Don't get me wrong- films like THE AVENGERS can be a blast, but give me a group of talented people with a small budget and a love for what they do, and I'm there!

WET KISS is a lurid tale of murder and revenge...of the most vile of actions having the most demanding consequences.

Having witnessed the brutal murder/suicide of her parents as a child, a young, seemingly Autistic woman ( Amira Lynn ) seeks only kindness & friendship. For an all too brief time, she finds just that with a young man named Pete ( Sean Holohan ). But Pete's ""associate"" Remy (James Panetta ) gets other ideas...

I don't do spoilers, so I'm not going to give any more of the plot away, but suffice to say Director Jenn Murphy ( I believe this was her first film ) manages to give her audience characters to Love, admire and loathe.

I look forward to more of this troupes work !",1352160000,2,943,4.365714285714286

  Thanks, Bryon",1243900800,,283,4.127272727272727

8329139,1,B001O2ZW06,"?????? what on Earth was this all about? Who were all those people??? What the Hell was going on???? Why did it take so long for that sunflower gal to knock 'em all off???? what were you waiting for honey, an engraved invitation????

This is one of the WORST films I've ever endured. The soundtrack, the acting, the plot everything SUCKED. NOTHING made any sense.

It took me back to off off Broadway productions; this movie makes all of those moments seem like Oscar-Tony-Emmy Award winning performances......all in one.

The actors in many of those stage productions were kinda green but at least they had integrity and they did their damnedest to give it everything they had in them and that includes the playwrights, directors and everybody else involved in those humble productions.

There was no editing room to hide behind or terrible digital effects to cover up the mistakes. When they made a mistake or a prop went awry the good actors knew how to flow with it and make it work.....in front of a live audience. thank you very much.

This film is just a big wet sloppy smelly tedious mess.",1421625600,,1097,4.66321243523316

8329145,1,B001O2ZW06,"Wet Kiss (2009) is an amateurish effort that has major issues with production, story, and acting.  Those associated with making the film may find that it has some merit, but the entertainment value outside of that small group, is probably limited.

Perhaps shot with a DSLR, the video has technical issues with basics like editing, and audio levels that are often either too loud, or too soft.  The actors may be doing their best, but none of them should consider quitting their day jobs.  The story is very simple, but is drawn out much longer than it needs to be.

Although not very impressive, the special effects aren't a total disaster.  A self inflicted gunshot to the head is done quite well, and is probably the most impactful scene in the entire movie, which concerns a traumatized homeless woman who is murdered by drowning, and then returns as a ghost to extract her revenge.

Wet Kiss is much closer to a student film, than a legitimate movie.  Unless you really enjoy an amateurish effort with poor production values, it's probably not even worth a watch for free on Amazon Instant Video.  It's startling that something like this was released on DVD, as the cover makes the movie look much more substantial than it actually is.",1369872000,4,1240,4.730232558139535
8329146,1,B001O2ZW06,"OK, I LIKE bad movies. B-movies, sci-fi originals, but this one...this one was HORRIBLE. It looked like it was filmed with a home video camera...complete with the effect of the wind blowing and masking the dialog. The ""special effects"" looked like they were done by my neighbors 5 year old, I mean, a shot of green slimy water going down the drain was one of the better effects. The plot was so unreal as to be laughable, but too stupid to even laugh at. And the ending....(spoiler alert)...

The ""ghost"" trying to drag the body of her friend into the lake, and he's obviously too heavy for her to move as she tries to pull him into the water...but we're expected to believe she dug the body up and carried it all the way from the graveyard??? DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE. It's time I can never get back.",1369526400,2,810,4.364238410596027
8329147,3,B001O2ZW06,"The movie was good. Just felt that the movie was dragging or else it would have got higher ratings. Still, it had its share of expense.",1368662400,,135,4.230769230769231
