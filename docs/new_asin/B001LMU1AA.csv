8318723,5,B001LMU1AA,"Like the other Essential Art House volumes, this one shows us quite a range of subjects, perspectives, and film-making styles from around the world.  Each one is an eye-opener in its way, though personally I think that The 400 Blows is a bit over-rated; to me, its story of a normal boy who ends up in a reformatory feels too obvious.  Black Orpheus is a visual feast, filmed at Carnival in Rio. I kept wondering how much has changed as Rio prepares for the Olympics.  I also think it helps to be familiar with the legend of Orpheus in the underworld, but that's not necessary to enjoy the movie.  Ikiru is a truly exceptional film with a bittersweet ending.  The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is veddy veddy British, and is thoroughly enjoyable.  Pygmalion is the 1938 version of G. B. Shaw's play -- the one that My Fair Lady is based upon.  I actually prefer Pygmalion to the musical, and Wendy Hiller is just perfect as Eliza Doolittle.  La Strada packs a major emotional punch in its story of brutality and love.

If you price these films individually, you'll see what a huge savings you get with this package.  Well worth the price!",1396051200,3,1140,4.517073170731707
8318724,5,B001LMU1AA,"This is one of the most solid sets of the Essential Art House Films.  These will disturb at times and inspire and make you think.  Ikiru is the highlight of the set.  I had never seen a non-Samurai era film by Kurosawa before and I was a little skeptical of the power of a modern story, but this film has full power and intensity.  It is truly NOT TO BE MISSED.",1368748800,4,361,4.042253521126761
