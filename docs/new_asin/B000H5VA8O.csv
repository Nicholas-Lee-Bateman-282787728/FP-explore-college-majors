8210250,4,B000H5VA8O,"The main portion of the Knights of Fuzz DVD is a newly produced documentary on the neo-garage scene, plus 20 newly -restored music videos from the best bands of the era. (See the band and video track listing at left.) Bonus video clips and radio show interviews complete the feature-packed video portion of the DVD.

The entire contents of the previous book, along with new photo sections, a 26-song audio compilation, fanzine reproductions and hundreds of new feature articles have been added to the disc as bonus DVD-ROM content. Simply place the disc in your DVD-ROM computer drive and view the book in your Web browser! (This bonus content is also available as a separate CD-ROM; see the ordering page.)

The book features thousands of international garage and psychedelic band histories, extensive CD and vinyl discographies, hundreds of interviews, and hundreds of rare photos and album cover reproductions. Chapters focus on international fanzines, garage music video, compilation albums, plus a detailed analysis of the worldwide modern garage and psychedelic scene.

So don't be fooled by mainstream media that misuses the terms ""garage and psych"" to describe their generic corporate product. Their attempts to re-write history will not stand the test of time -- ""The Knights of Fuzz"" exists to tell the actual story of the garage & psychedelic underground and the bands that make it an international phenomenon!

8210251,5,B000H5VA8O,"This is Volume One.  Let's hope there is a Volume 2 ahead.  The DVD covers the US and Canada and features videos by: Chesterfield Kings / Fuzztones / Miracle Workers / Yard Trauma / Gruesomes / 10 Commandments / Fortune & Maltese / Cynics / Untamed Youth / Girl Trouble / Jonny Chan & The New Dynasty 6 / Plasticland / Freddy & the Four-Gone Conclusions / Woggles / Les Breastfeeders / Marshmallow Overcoat.  There is a short documentary that is a very general overview of garage/psychedelic music.  This compilation covers the US and Canada from 1980 to the present.  If you're a fan, you should be able to name hundreds more bands that should have been included.  This DVD also includes a HTML version of the out of print 'Knights of Fuzz' book and some MP3s.  This is really worth getting and i hope Dionysus Records releases more DVDs in the series.",1164240000,3,853,4.5359477124183005
