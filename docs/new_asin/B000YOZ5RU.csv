8233711,4,B000YOZ5RU,"I give this DVD 4 stars because the films themselves are very good for TV movies.  They have good, solid acting by accomplished performers.  The stories themselves are excellent and not just ""formula"" where you can guess what's next every step of the way.  The directing and filming are above-par for such vehicles.

Keep in mind, these films were made years ago, before cell phones, desktop computers, text messaging, all the modern stuff.  So don't think you are going to get a technology-driven story or wonder why the characters don't ""do"" certain things to change their situations -- because they couldn't back then.

I have not mentioned any of the specifics of the films, so as not to spoil anything.  Both of these movies are worth watching -- they are under 2 hours and worth the time.

The quality of the print is not very good -- or I should say, it reminded me of some of the VHS movies I used to watch -- before digital came along and changed everything.  Too bad some of these films can't be transferred to DVD and then somehow made more ""crisp"" to view.

Once you get into the story, though, I don't think you'll mind.

Both of these films are little gems.",1333238400,,1171,4.5285714285714285
