8101462,1,B000CS2ST6,I wanted to get my children this DVD because it was my favorite movie as a child. We were so excited to see it and were disappointed in its quality. It was so bad and blurry that We could not even watch it. It is unacceptable. The description of the DVD said none of this. It pisses me off that anyone would have the audacity to even sell this item. This is basically robbery. Don't waste your time nor your money. I would pay extra for good quality.,1311724800,5,450,4.125
8101463,1,B000CS2ST6,This is the worst quality DVD I have ever seen. It is a dodgy copy of a VHS tape that Amazon should be ashamed of. I will certainly demand a refund,1303862400,3,147,3.774193548387097
8101464,1,B000CS2ST6,"I bought this movie for my daughter having watched it extensively as a child myself.  I found that I could barely watch this video.  I am surprised that Amazon is even selling this item based on the fact that the quality is that of a poorly pirated copy.  I could have my old VHS copy restored to higher quality than this. If the description of the product was properly explained, I would have spent more money on a better quality edition. All in all, I guess that's what you should expect for a $6 ""DVD"".",1252454400,3,505,4.294736842105263
8101465,2,B000CS2ST6,"if you're looking to sing along with all the songs you loved in this movie, buy a different version--this one's edited. i got the whole way through it and thought, ""i wonder when they'll sing 'the quack quack song'""? lo and behold, it's not on here. glad i only spent a dollar (i bought it analog). caveat emptor!",1221264000,,313,4.413793103448276
8101466,3,B000CS2ST6,"has not aged well, the kids at work picked on me about it. Brought back alot of memories, though. I recommend renting, if you can find it.",1213315200,,138,4.148148148148148
