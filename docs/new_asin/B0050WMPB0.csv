8451997,5,B0050WMPB0,"An excellent movie. The way the teachers conducted themselves in Germany is the same as I remember teachers conducting themselves when I was growing up. In more recent times teachers are not allowed to behave that way. However, it adds a strange sort of depth to the relationship between students, teachers and community. I actually really enjoyed watching (and listening to) this movie.",1406851200,,387,5.158730158730159
8451998,4,B0050WMPB0,"Set in the city of Brunswick, German Empire, in 1874, a German drama Der ganz groe Traum follows the story of a real-life teacher Konrad Koch (Daniel Brhl), who introduced football (or soccer, depending where you are living) into Germany. He is like John Keating of Dead Poets Society  an idealistic teacher with unconventional teaching methods, who is not afraid of taking risks.

Most teachers at the German elite school disapprove it because, as you know, modern-day football (or association football) started in England. The story of Koch, who struggles to change the old-fashioned teaching methods by using sports as an educational tool, is pretty predictable, but entertaining.

Compared with the Peter Weir classic, the German film is more optimistic and light-hearted. After all, football did become popular in Germany as the success of Bundesliga testifies. Der ganz groe Traum also stresses the aspect of football or sports in general as a thing that transcends class and cultural differences.

Filmmakers seem to have taken great liberty with the historical facts (read the article titled ""This is a ball, a football"" at FIFA website). There are also some coincidences that are too good to be true, but with effective acting from the star and supporting cast, the film is enjoyable.",1393891200,3,1293,5.172248803827751
