4988353,5,B006H3KQG2,"This two-hour episode of the syndicated ""David Suskind Show"" - the second in a series of ""first time on home video"" releases by S'more Entertainment (the first was Jerry Lewis interview - which I also reviewed on Amazon) - is VERY funny. I hasn't been available since 1970. If you look at the cover of the package, you will see three faces besides Susskind: Mel Brooks, George Segal (the actor, not the modern artist) and David Steinberg. But also on the program are author Dan Greenburg (""How to be a Jewish Mother""), pizzeria chain owner Larry Goldberg, and fashion designer Stan Herman (known as Mr. Mort in the business). Greenberg gets asked a bunch of questions but - though they are on the set, the other two rarely open their mouth. Than again, no one besides Brooks gets any chance to talk. Brooks comments on everything, whether asked to or not. And - as expected - he is hilarious. This is the period when the original film version of ""The Producers"" was out and ""The 12 Chairs"" was a recent event.

Another reviewer commented that the image is grainy and not ""restored"". I'm not sure how much restoration could be done and - for me - it was the audio that counted and seeing this show what, for me, was the first time. (I saw many Suskind shows in the 1960s and 1970s but I don't remember this one.

Brooks did a one-on-one hour with Dick Cavett last year for HBO (NOT on video to my knowledge) and he did another one about 15 years ago that I saw on VHS. But, as I said, Brooks is all over this one and Brooks fans will want this DVD, I curious to see what show the folks at Smore choose for the next release.

4988354,5,B006H3KQG2,"I first saw this program when it originally aired in 1970 (why yes, I'm old).  I thought it was simply hilarious then and after all these years, it still holds true.  I originally taped this when it was repeated back in the early 1980's on VHS, but that tape didn't last so I'm happy to have the DVD.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that the quality of the broadcast is terrible.  It's watchable, but it was extremely grainy and not clear at all.  If you're going to release a DVD of this classic episode, would it have killed them to re-master it and put out a decent copy?  As it is, it looks like my VHS copy that I would have burned onto a DVD.",1330214400,5,657,4.09375

8498067,5,B006H3KQG2,"Truly one of the funniest single shows in television history.  I had an audio of it, taped off the air in New York in the 1980s.  Hadn't seen the video since then.  I was amazed by how much I remembered accurately, but also how much was 'new' to me as I watched.",1415404800,,262,4.0

8498069,5,B006H3KQG2,"Excellent content, poor quality reproduction. sound is muffled, too bad-as it's a classic. I would recommend it regardless as the David Susskind Program is superb!!!! Mel Brooks is at his outrageous best. It's a keeper. Wonderful Performances for those who want to spend two hours in the company of incomparable comedians!",1406937600,,322,5.333333333333333
8498070,5,B006H3KQG2,I first saw this years ago on the original broadcast and it still makes me laugh myself silly.  Mel Brooks hi-jacks the show and riffs for the whole program. The other panelists are just set dressing.,1402617600,,200,4.555555555555555
8498071,4,B006H3KQG2,"Funny, funny...Mel Brooks just can't help himself.  He is a comedian genius!  The quality of the video itself is not great, but once I start laughing, who cares!",1371859200,2,161,4.714285714285714
8498072,5,B006H3KQG2,"I also saw this when it was televised - never forgot it - Brooks is in his zone - unbelievable - and all the others seem to realize it - although they are good too, except for Larry Goldberg (I had forgotten his name) - he was so unfunny - his comments were cringe-worthy - so finally they just ignored him. Even little Stan Herman did well - watch for his delayed comment in reaction to something said - what a laugh it got from Brooks! So glad I tracked this down - good heavens after all these years - I still think it's the funniest piece of television I've seen - Judy - get a life???????",1356566400,,593,4.076923076923077
8498073,5,B006H3KQG2,"Mel Brooks monopolized this piece of talk show history. All the guests gave great insight into what their mothers were like but Mel held court. It was even difficult for a new, young comedian, David Steinberg to get a word in. Susskind tried to restrain Brooks but gave up.

I wish there where more of this kind of old talk shows available. You really get an insight to the time and the people. Fortunately, Dick Cavett has put many of his episodes from the early 70s on DVD. There need to be more of these out there.",1351641600,,517,4.329896907216495
