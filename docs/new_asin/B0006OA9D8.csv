2190360,3,B0006OA9D8,DVD on Paul's missionary journeys was quite informative.  It did move along quite rapidly and at times was hard to keep up with narrative.  All in all a good DVD to start a study of Paul.,1315008000,3,187,4.166666666666667
2190361,4,B0006OA9D8,"I love DVDs on the History of Christianity. This product discusses more of the locations of events rather than the actual teaching of Apostle Paul, which was what I desired, but it is always good to see some of the places visited by this great man and leader of our Christian Faith.",1287619200,5,282,4.4423076923076925
2190362,3,B0006OA9D8,"The first 35 or so minutes of the 48 minute video were very good.  The last part was defective.  I ordered a replacement with the same result.
Both copies were sold as new and I can only conclude that the master is in some way defective",1247443200,11,236,4.108695652173913
2190363,5,B0006OA9D8,"Apostle Paul and the Earliest Churches

The movie Apostle Paul and the Earliest Churches blends three factors
1) Narration of the biblical accounts
2) Actors in costumes acting out the narration
3) Travelogue of the current locations indicated by the journeys.

The camera shows ancient ruins and modern day activities along the journeys of Paul. The views of the many archeological sites make this film a special treasure.

Plus there are good computer graphic maps to help appreciate where he went. It is amazing to notice how far Paul traveled and especially by ship.

The three missionary journeys are presented and the ruins of the many churches along the way. It was to these churches that Paul wrote the letters that came to us in the Bible as the epistles. So the movie gives a visual and historic context to the epistles also. Together the book of Acts and the epistles make up much of the New Testament.

The motion picture gives the many events of the book of Acts has a greater context. This aids in appreciating the cross cultural challenges Paul faced plus the challenges of traveling under primitive conditions.

Here is the account of how one man in a few years was used by God to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ and start dozens of churches. That set into motion what became the major world religion of Christianity. World history teaches us that Christianity and conflicts surrounding it have greatly impacted western civilization for two thousand years. Church history tells the tale of the changes in how the faith was understood and practiced as denominations emerged over the centuries. Yet much of this has roots in what is shown in this picture.

The movie could be appreciated by new Christians as well as those who have studied the Bible for years.

Teachers and preachers could use short clips to introduce a lesson or illustrate a point.

Christian schools would be wise to put this into the collection of their library.",1189900800,42,1950,4.81437125748503
2190364,4,B0006OA9D8,A quick guide and fairly accurate guide through most of the New Testament and gives a helicopter view of Paul's journey and ministry during the first century of Christianity. These were the earliest churches and shows the historic and Jewish roots of the Christian faiths that had been suppressed either ignorantly or deliberately. An excellent summary to the new testaments especially for new believers.,1176163200,27,404,5.328125

One of my fondest memories of living with my grandpa was going to monthly biblical archaeology meetings together. While I haven't had the opportunity to visit biblical locations, I find presentations on the topic quite interesting. FishFlix, a vendor of Christian DVDs, asked me to review a DVD entitled, Apostle Paul and The Earliest Churches, described on the cover as ""Ephesus, Antioch, Tarsus, Galatia--an illuminating visit to the places where key New Testament events took place.""

Indeed, this documentary provides visuals for many sites Paul visited in the course of his ministry. However, the sites weren't well-described. Various images and details were shown on screen, but often for only a second. I found myself frequently wanting to examine the details longer and find out more of the history and information about the location.

Ultimately, the documentary seems to have two related, but distinct purposes: (1) reenact Paul's missionary journeys, and (2) explore the historical, religious, and archaeological history of the sites Paul visited. Unfortunately, in 48 minutes, this is too much to try to accomplish, and the DVD did not seem to effectively capture either purpose, both being cut short by the other. I frequently kept wondering what the intent of the film was.

There is a lot of great potential, but it just feels like it is trying to be too many things to be effective. Production quality was modest and dated, and extra attention to detail and consistency would have been beneficial (for instance, captions would be helpful, and text on screen always said ""Antioch in Psidia"" while the narrator always said ""Psidian Antioch,"" which sounds like Psidia in Antioch).

It's not a bad film, but it's really a very basic introduction. The study guide actually seems stronger than the documentary itself, but even that is pretty basic.

8041997,3,B0006OA9D8,"The DVD was a little different from what I expected when I first opened the package. The story was told by narration. The man's voice reminded me of someone talking about the migration of the Wildebeest on NatGeo. The tone was a bit stilted and not very conversational. There was no acting, unless you consider people walking in the desert or riding on horseback acting. I did like seeing all the ruins and the ancient maps and cities. This would be a good video to show kids in school about the life of Paul if you wanted it to be part of your lesson. It gives an overview of his life and travels and did incorporate some scripture along the way. For a documentary it wasn't bad. I would recommended it for Sunday School teachers and home school parents.",1465689600,,755,4.438848920863309
8041998,5,B0006OA9D8,"This is a very well produced Apostle Paul DVD documentary. Initially you can select to play the movie, go directly to a particular Chapter (the documentary is divided into 5 Chapters: Paul's Calling, 1st Missionary Journey, 2nd Missionary Journey, 3rd Missionary Journey, A Lasting Legacy), or select the languages among English, Turkish and Arabic. You also have access to a Study guide named ApostlePaulGuide.pdf, that is a beautifully illustrated document with 16 pages in pdf format.
The documentary is narrated by Kris Chandler, and the tone is just perfect, not boring nor exasperated. He has a nice pitch and keep the information flowing naturally.
There are just a few scenes with actors, but they do not speak at all. Always the narrator is speaking in the background, telling the story that is developing.

This is a very informative documentary and I recommend it to the permanent library of any Christian. It is a boost to our faith, seeing and being inspired by the life and work of the Apostle Paul.

I received this DVD from FishFlix, a company that produces Christian DVDs (to inspire and entertain) for reviewing, and I was not requested to post a positive review. Opinion expressed here is my own.
As an extra bonus, FishFlix gives you a US$ 5.00 coupon to buy their products if you decide to join their e-mail list.",1464998400,,1334,4.872246696035242
8041999,2,B0006OA9D8,"I was asked by FishFlix.com staff if Id be willing to review Christian DVDs. I didn't know which genres movie Id receive, but I was pretty stoked when I saw it was a biblical documentary: Apostle Paul and the EarliestChurches DVD.  Im not really into fiction (books or movies, to be honest), so this one promised/hoped to be right up my alley.

However, when I inserted the DVD into my blue ray player, I was a little taken aback when I heard the odd music and saw the less-than-stellar picture quality on my screen.  My first impression was, Wow, this seems dated (which I discovered in the end credits that it was copyrighted/produced in 2003!).

The content of the video itself takes the watcher through Pauls missionary journeys as told by Luke in the book of Acts, stopping briefly at the cities of Asia Minor.  The video showed excavations as well as modern life in those ancient locations.  Being only 48 minutes long, however, the videos brief stops at each city are but mere fly-by's, each stop not containing much depth.

From the DVD menu, the controller has the option to select from the various DVD chapters:
Pauls Calling
First Missionary Journey
Second Missionary Journey
Third Missionary Journey
A Lasting Legacy

After the video has run its course, you can remove the DVD and insert it into your PCs CD-ROM for an added feature: a PDF study guide.  Ill be honest, the study guide (in my opinion) was pretty decent.  The guide contained a few pictures, brief historical background, and numerous questions for individual or group study.

FishFlix is offering a $5 coupon, however, if you join their email list.  You can join by visiting [...] or texting 5-GIFT to 44222.

Recommendations/Rating: I give this one just 2 stars.  I wasn't very interesting/engaging, and its quality is dated.

8042005,4,B0006OA9D8,The DVD is narrative and geographical tour of actual sights of the churches . It is informative geography wise where Paul travelled and how the churches looked like . The churches were actual structures as my understanding there are very interesting to see structures of early churches built by early Christians. Paul not Peter really spread the message of Christ after his death. Peter was chosen but I am able to see that the Holy Spirit really inspired Paul to travel back and forth and head for Rome to spread the love of Jesus.,1363651200,,532,4.670212765957447
