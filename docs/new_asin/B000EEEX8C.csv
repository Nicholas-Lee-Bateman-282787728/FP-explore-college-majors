He has about 5 bellys so he has a great range of blubber sounds... As far as the DVD, Ritchie Blackmore is the king of the guitar, what is he doing playing medieval music with the bimbo??? Grab Dio and start up rainbow again, dude!!!  Metal is not dead!!!",1155686400,,375,4.3428571428571425

8108781,5,B000EEEX8C,"I've been a fan of Ritchie's for over 35 years. And I've got to say that this is Richtie at his best. I've seen Ritchie play in Rainbow 2 times, Deep Purple (Perfect Strangers Tour) and Blackmore's Night 2 times. Dio's vocals and Cozy's drumming are outstanding. Ritchie's solos are brilliant as always. Must buy for true fans.",1149897600,3,327,4.655172413793103
