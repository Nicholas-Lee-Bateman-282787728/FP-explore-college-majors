It begins in 1941 when a British submarine surfaces to land British Commandos behind enemy lines in Libya. Their purpose is to kill one man. They attack a house using machine guns and grenades. Did they get him? Rommel was seen as a symbol and must be eliminated. Fighting goes on in 1942. Two years later Rommel was dead while the war continued. After the war ended Lt. Col. Desmond Young investigated Rommels death and wrote a book that was adapted to this movie. Young had been a POW in 1942 and met Rommel. The German forces are short of petrol and other supplies. Rommel orders changes in tactics to meet an attack by Montgomery. They show actual battle scenes between armor and artillery. [Stock movies from the war.] The German forces are being pushed back, but they are told to stand and fight to the last man. Rommel makes his decision.

[Are those who know local conditions the best judge of tactics?] Rommel was returned to Germany for health reasons. The war is not going well, the Afrika Korps was abandoned. Can they win? They have no choice as long as AH is in power. Abdication? What if AH turns against Rommel? Stollen shakes a tail. In 1943 Rommel inspects the German defenses against any invasion and reports to Von Rundstedt. There are many places for a successful invasion. What can be done? Rommel is warned to be on his guard. Rommel expects an attack in the spring. Dr. Stollen visits him; is his house wired? Stollen mentions the names of men who plan to remove Hitler. Rommel isn't interested; he cant decide. In June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy. [This, like the Battle of Kursk, marked the beginning of the end.] Von Rundstedt analyzes Hitlers decisions; his astrologer tells him what to do. [Who controls them?] Is it much too late?

Rommel gets a note from Stulpnagel. Three men were captured and will be made to talk; they must act at once. Rommel calls Keitel to meet Hitler tomorrow. There is a crisis. Hitler explains his plans - in two weeks! The V-weapon will revolutionize warfare, AH says. On July17 airplanes shot up a German staff car. On July 20 a bomb exploded in Hitlers bunker, but he survived! Five thousand suspects were rounded up. Rommel is summoned to Berlin to talk about another command. He is told about a charge of Treason. Deathbed confessions? The verdict is pre-ordained, Rommel must resolve this himself. His family would be safe. It is either poison of the garrott. Rommel says goodbye to his wife; he is leaving and won't return. There are final comments on Rommel by Winston Churchill.

This 1951 movie was criticized as being too sympathetic to a Nazi general. Is it? Does it gloss over the evils of Nazi Fascism? It does take a limited view of the war, like some history books that discuss one facet of the war. There was one book that said adding a bottle of gasoline to the bomb would have created a fire and asphyxiate all inside a closed room. But a bottle of liquid would gurgle and arouse suspicion. Would the removal of Hitler have ended the war sooner? Could Germany have switched sides and ally with Britain and America? I don't think so. Holding out this promise was a way to create division among the Germans, even if some of the Allies would have preferred Hitler before the war. Allies read the coded messages of the Germans and knew most of what was going on. Not to mention the Rote Kapelle.",1412812800,,3431,4.592169657422512
