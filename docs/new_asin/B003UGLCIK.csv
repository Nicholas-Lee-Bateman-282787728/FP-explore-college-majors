4203230,5,B003UGLCIK,The perfect collection at the perfect price. The movies are classic & the DVD Case is beautiful. Inside I was surprized & delighted to find a collection of postcards filled with Bogart memories from both his personal & professional life. I look forward to puchasing more Classic Movie Collections in the future due to my extreme satisfactin with this one. Amazon is the best.,1302998400,2,375,4.875
4203231,5,B003UGLCIK,"The shipper was fantastic about getting it to me before the intended recipients Birthday. Communication was awesome, and the DVD set was spectacular! I haven't heard a negative peep from her since she got it. I'd recommend this set AND this seller to all!",1302566400,2,255,4.818181818181818
4203232,5,B003UGLCIK,"My mom (bless her heart) loved Bogart, she thought he was a dream..I can't say he's a dream but he is a great actor..I enjoy his movies,
very much and do recommend young and old to give him a try...you might enjoy him as much as my mother did and I now do...quotes from some of his movies..Things are never so bad they can't be made worse.

4203233,4,B003UGLCIK,"First off, let me say, I love this set.  I previously owned the first version of the Signature set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bogart-Collection-Casablanca-The-Maltese-Falcon-To-Have-and-Have-Not-The-Big-Sleep-The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre/dp/B0000TG48S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bogart Collection (Casablanca/The Maltese Falcon/To Have and Have Not/The Big Sleep/The Treasure of the Sierra Madre)</a>), and will be giving it to a friend.  Fantastic to own so many great Bogart flicks -- all those on the Signature Collection, plus rarer gems like They Drive By Night.

As I was giving my Signature set one last look before giving it away -- watching all the 2nd disk stuff that isn't in The Essentials -- in the case of Casablanca and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, I got what I expected:  The Essentials included all the data from the first disk, but not the second.  Fine...  better to get 24 movies instead of 5, even if it means giving up a few bonus features.

In the case of ""The Big Sleep"" however, they included instead what was on the B side of that two-sided disk: the inferior prerelease 1945 version, not the better 1946 theatrical release.  There was a reason WB held up the release for a year, because the  1945 version simply isn't as good.  The 1945 release was the bonus selection in the Signature Collection, but in The Essentials, they pass it off as the main feature.

Looking at the comments in response to the 3-star review ""A Few Bugs In Bogart"", it is apparent that WB's quality control is lacking, and different copies of The Essentials have different versions of the DVDs.  (It is also apparent from those comments, that requests to WB to replace this disks are not always successful -- I will be trying my luck on that.)

To tell which version of ""The Big Sleep"" you have, go to chapter 18.  If you see Lauren Bacall wearing a ridiculous looking veil (presumably in mourning after the death of her family's chauffeur), you too have the wrong version.

I was thrilled when this set came out, but am disappointed that ""The Big Sleep"", my favorite Bogart movie of all time, will no longer be my favorite on this set.",1294531200,25,2199,5.120448179271708
4203234,3,B003UGLCIK,"This is a great collection for the avid or passing Bogart fan. Price, picture and extras are all first rate...

BUT...I just purchased this set in Canada and noticed two of my discs were missing content and one movie wasn't even included. Here's what I found:

Disc 2: Dark Victory / Virginia City - This set uses double-sided DVDs. The Dark Victory side is missing the commentary track by James Ursini & Paul Clinton, as well as the Featurette 1939: Tough Competition for Dark Victory listed on the box. There might be more content missing because the menu doesn't match. It also starts right into the movie without the menu coming up first like it should. (You have to stop the movie for the menu.)

Disc 6: Casablanca / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre - The Casablanca side is missing the two commentaries and the intro by Lauren Bacall listed on the box. Again, it starts right into the movie without the menu coming up. On The Treasure of the Sierra Madre side, the movie is missing altogether - as well as the commentary, etc. referred to on the box. Instead, the menu reads ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre - Special Features Disc 2"" and has some features not listed on the box. It also says ""Additional Special Features on Disc 1."" (It appears Warner Brothers accidentally transferred the wrong disc over from their 'Sierra Madre' Special Edition DVD set to press this disc.)

I'm not sure how widespread these mistakes are - but hopefully, WB Customer Service can arrange for replacement discs for me or anyone else out there with the same problem and get this mess straightened out.",1287100800,136,1594,4.641843971631205
4203235,5,B003UGLCIK,"If you're a hard-core fan of Bogie's finest film work, I would still recommend the multi-disc collections of some of the titles of ""The Essential Collection"", over this new release (there are excellent special editions of ""Casablanca"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", and other classics). If, however, you want an overview of Humphrey Bogart's remarkable career at Warner Brothers, I can't think of a better collection to buy. Warner Home Video creates wonderful 'packages' for features, including commentaries, newsreels, trailers, and vintage cartoons, radio broadcasts, and short film features, and the inclusion of the terrific TCM documentary, ""The Brothers Warner"", on the tempestuous careers of Jack & Co., Bogie film bloopers (on occasion, Bogie's reactions on flubbing a line were unprintable, but funny!), the minature one-sheet advertising recreations and correspondence, and the book, of course...well, there are a LOT of incentives to shell out the money for this compilation!

The films offered are certainly the best of the Warner years, with all four of his teamings with wife Lauren Bacall, his John Huston classics, his 'Murderers' Row' years with Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and George Raft, his most successful films with Bette Davis (""The Petrified Forest"", ""Dark Victory"" and ""Marked Woman""), and his laughably bad attempt at a Mexican accent (""Virginia City""...Westerns were simply not his forte!). Naturally, ""Casablanca"" is here (as well as a few of the film variations it inspired), yet surprisingly, Bogie's richly-layered post-war Noir portrayals are largely ignored (I was surprised ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" and ""Dead Reckoning"" were left out). Still, the choices are outstanding.

If you are just beginning to 'discover' the actor many consider Hollywood's greatest star, I strongly recommend you check out his post-Warner's performances, as well. Films like ""In a Lonely Place"", ""The African Queen"" (his Oscar winner), ""Sabrina"", ""Beat the Devil"", ""The Caine Mutiny"", and ""The Harder They Fall"" are every bit as impressive as the output from his days sparring with Jack Warner...

Enjoy a magnificent film star!",1286064000,54,2167,5.501501501501502
4203236,5,B003UGLCIK,"I am 30 years old, and a fan of contemporary crime and action flicks, but I never have neglected the classics, and among the classics, no one stands out more so that Humphrey Bogart. A man's man in the truest sense, he was a tough guy, more in attitude and can do that in physical brawn. He was cool, but not arrogant, handsome, but not good looking. Simply, he was a true action star and a role model for guys of all times. Stars like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Mickey Rourke, even Sylvester Stallone owe a debt to Bogie. As for the films, oh, yes, these are films, not just movies or flicks, these are to be savored. As for the films, they're a mixed bag, some of are only good, a number are great, all have Bogie, and anything with him is worth watching and easily watched. So if you've never seen these films, or only a few this is a must purcahse: CASABLANCA, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, HIGH SIERRA, THE BIG SLEEP, KEY LARGO, THE MALTESE FALCON, THE PETRIFIED FOREST, THE ROARING TWENTIES, masterpieces all. Fans of Goodfellas, Mean Streets, The Godfather, even The Expendables, should gives these classics a chance. After all these decades, Humphrey Bogart is still the man.",1284076800,15,1187,4.5
4203237,5,B003UGLCIK,"...and every one of these films are already available - at least in DVD collections - previously put out by Warner Brothers. There is not one new release in the set. What it does do is put back into circulation several individual titles that have gone out of print. At least Warner Brothers has not entirely shut off their supply of classic films new to DVD, but it is down to a trickle if you don't count the Warner Archive.

Do note that several of Bogart's films are being released on Blu-Ray, so if high definition classics are your thing you might want to rethink the following:
Treasure of the Sierra Madre
Maltese Falcon
These two are due out on Blu the same time that this collection is being released. What differentiates Humphrey Bogart's career from other Warner legends such as Errol Flynn and James Cagney is that Bogart was in films for over ten years and largely as a supporting player before he finally broke through into leads in consistently good films, thus he has twenty films that are not on pressed DVD to which Warner Brothers holds the rights. The following Bogart films are under the control of Warner Brothers and have never been on DVD:
Love Affair (1932)
Big City Blues (1932)
Two Against the World (1936)
China Clipper (1936)
Isle of Fury (1936)
The Great O'Malley (1937)
Swing Your Lady (1938)
Men Are Such Fools (1938)
Racket Busters (1938)
King of the Underworld (1939)
Oklahoma Kid (1939)
You Can't Get Away With Murder (1939)
It All Came True (1940)
The Wagons Roll at Night (1941)
The Big Shot (1942)
Conflict (1945)
The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947)
Chain Lightning (1951)
The Enforcer (1951)
Crime School is available via the Warner Archives.
Granted, quite a few of these are B or even B- pictures and/or have Bogart in a supporting role but they're still Bogart films. It would be nice to see at least a few of them be released properly.",1279324800,157,1871,4.618618618618618

4203268,3,B003UGLCIK,"This box set has everything BUT the movie "" The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" which I find to be a complete rip off for what we paid for this box set and the box set PROMISES this movie in one of the disc but only shows ""features"" ABOUT the movie rather than showing the movie itself. Now I have to purchase this movie individually. Also, "" Dark Victory"" and ""The Roaring 20s"" does not feature Bogart as a central character. Bogart is only 3rd billing in these movies rather than including his best gangster movies where he is the central character, which is the entire point of getting the box set. So, the box set is okay, but the choices that they made to include his earlier films weren't included as Bogart has made many, many films. The box set really only has the main stream selection and doesn't even include ""Conflict"" and a number of other movies where Bogart plays the main character. A bit disappointed with this set because there are so far 4 movies that I have to purchase outside of this box set that I should not have to. The remastering is pretty good and not a mere poor transfer, but whoever made the selections did not do a very good job at show casing his full talents.",1469404800,8,1191,4.345291479820628

4203327,4,B003UGLCIK,"I was a bit nervous about ordering this set on account of the reviews here indicating that some content was missing. But when the price dipped to less than $2.50 a movie, I crossed my fingers and ordered. I am glad I did!

I am pleased to report that my set does include all 24 movies (I have not verified the miscellaneous extras that some reviewers have reported missing, because I am mainly interested in the movies). This is a great collection of films and old Hollywood stars. I am particularly glad to finally have added The Petrified Forest to my DVD library, having first seen it decades ago on the late, late show. Not to mention classics like The Maltese Falcon, the Bacall movies and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. While I might eventually upgrade to Blu-Ray on some of these, it is a sure bet that all of these titles won't be on Blu-Ray, and certainly not with a difference in quality that offsets this nearly $2 a movie deal.

One down side that I would note. I would have rated this five stars if it weren't for the two-sided disc format with micro-print names on the discs. But aside from that complaint, this is a must have for old movie buffs who have a Bogey-anemic DVD collection! Also, it appears that the collection still includes the pre-release version of The Big Sleep rather than the theatrical release. I would have preferred the theatrical version...

Even though this set does not include the 70th Anniversary edition of Casablanca (by the way -- get that disc, and Sahara!), at the current price of $54 this set is a value that can't be beat.",1450137600,7,1571,4.524647887323944

For example, the side of a disc that was supposed to contain the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre was a print from the second disc in that film's individual release, meaning no movie, just special features.

4203389,3,B003UGLCIK,"3 stars,  because it has some movies that are VERY hard to find.
The plus side is that it has movies that I can't find anywhere else.
Treasure of The Sierra Madre is missing, as others have noted. Also, Casablanca starts skipping in chapter 32 and finally grinds to a halt.  Tried on 3 different players. Casablanca also does not open to the root menu, so you are apt to miss some good additional content.
These things do not  totally spoil the experience, , as I already have those two, but I was looking forward to having the complete set in one box. I will make certain to check out all of the disks before the 30 days are up, which is a PITA, since I had planned on watching the set over a longer period and savoring the movies that I've never seen before.
I suppose that it's a sad commentary on the time in which we live, that we have come to accept shoddy and incomplete merchandise as the norm, and this is a shoddy piece of work.",1424044800,10,938,4.2

Also missing were the audio commentaries for ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" and ""Invisible Stripes.""  It also appears that Warner Bros. rewrote the cover art to eliminate the described extras which were not included in some of their discs!

I called the WBshop for replacement discs but they said it wasn't their problem since the purchase was not made at their website.  I sent an email to WB corporate requesting replacement discs which has not been answered as of this posting.

4203404,5,B003UGLCIK,"I'd give Bogart 6 stars, but TW gets 0. Treasure of Sierra Madre DVD is not usable, because there are over 5,000 bad sectors.  It doesn't work on my DVD player connected to my TV and doesn't work on my computer.  My Linux machine was used to diagnose the problem.  I vaguely remember an earlier DVD special feature in this set was dysfunctional.  I've only gotten up to viewing Treasure ... and I hope that the rest of them work.  I'm glad that I started to review them, because they were being sent to my son in Afghanistan.  The sad thing is that I'll end up spending more getting the defective product replaced than I payed for it.  (Note to TW tech support - I was writing assembler while you were in diapers, so don't tell me 5000 bad sectors is my problem.)

What really ticks me off is that I have all of B. Traven's books in German, and I was going to make a picture of me holding the  book Treasure ... and put it in the DVD box.  My son knows that I read Traven's entire works and followed what little historians knew about him.  I thought remembering things we shared together when he was high school would give him a little joy, but now there is no joy in Mudville, because  mighty Time Warner struck out at bat.

The least Time Warner could do is make a big donation to the USO.

I had to go and purchase the better version elsewhere, as it is definitely one of my favourite Bogie movies! Although, it was interesting to watch the original version... it gave so much more explanation of the convoluted plot line (as this movie is known as Hollywood's most convoluted and impossible to follow plotline of all time! :P), and was definitely fun to watch! I just wish they included the better version too!! Also, some screwy things go on with some of the bonus features on the discs that I've watched so far. But overall, I don't regret this purchase...

The first several movies feature Bogey in supporting roles but many of these are wonderful nonetheless. The bonus here is in addition to Bogey, you also get great actors like Edward G. Robinson, George Raft, and Bette Davis. These are wonderful actors that ,shame on me, I am just now discovering with this set. Better late than never. I am working my way through them now and have watched the first 12. I am thoroughly enjoying all these films and am pleased to add this treasure trove of classic movies and actors to my collection. Also, my set was perfect with no duplicates or omissions like others have stated. The only negative I can say about this is the 2 sided flipper discs these are on.

Bogie did his only made for TV movie,Remake of The Petrified Forest(Producers Showcase 1955)with Henry Fonda,Lauren Bacall,Jack Klugman,Jack Warden,and Richard Jaeckal which would have made a good addition,but sadly its not included.
Dead End and Stand In are two Bogie classics from the 1930s,but needless to say are not included.
Bogies only MGM film,the so so,Battle Circus is guess what?Yes,you would be right,not included.

4203465,5,B003UGLCIK,"First of all, I hate the title -- any Bogart compilation that's missing ""African Queen"" and ""Caine Mutiny"" but includes ""Virginia City"" and ""The Amazing Mr. Clitterhouse"" is hardly an ""essential collection.""  I do understand that Warner can only include films to which it holds the rights (but where is ""Dead Reckoning""?) -- so a more accurate title could have been ""The (Incomplete) Warner Bros. Collection.""

Second, I hate it when Amazon doesn't tell you exactly what you're getting in a collection!  So as a public service, here is what you get:
Petrified Forest
Marked Woman
Kid Galahad
Black Legion
San Quentin
The Roaring Twenties
Dark Victory
Virginia City
The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse
Invisible Stripes
High Sierra
They Drive by Night
Maltese Falcon
Across the Pacific
All Through the Night
Brother Orchid
Action in the North Atlantic
Passage to Marseilles,
To Have and Have Not/
The Big Sleep
Dark Passage
Key Largo
Casablanca
Treasure of the Sierra Madre

As you can see, some curious choices of inclusion and exclusion, but for the price it's a great deal.  And you just need to understand that some important films are missing.  Go out and find ""Dead Reckoning"", ""In a Lonely Place"", ""African Queen"" ""Sabrina"", ""Beat the Devil"", ""Caine Mutiny"", and ""The Harder They Fall"" -- and you really will have an ""essential Bogart collection.""",1314316800,7,1346,5.04054054054054

4203467,4,B003UGLCIK,"This hefty collection is by no means an exhaustive survey of Bogart's acting career... but its a mighty fine way to cover some of the highlights oh his time at Warner Brothers. Sure, you miss out on some of his other work on classics like African Queen and yes, there's a few of what could be considered his B-movie appearances, but still, I can think of many worse ways to spend a rainy night in:)",1307577600,,398,4.32
4203468,5,B003UGLCIK,"I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day and he was crazy happy with this gift. While we had all of the 24 films featured on this set in either VHS or DVD format, this presented a great opportunity to consolidate all these films in one place. The bonus options included (vintage cartoons, shorts, outtakes, and the interesting Brothes Warner doc) and the commemorative booklet made this package a great gift for the ultimate Bogart fan-atic who has everything(even his own Maltese Falcon).
The 24 film titles included are in addition to the Warner documentary: Petrified Forest/Marked Woman, Kid Galahad/ Black Legion, San Quentin/The Roaring Twenties, Dark Victory/Virginia City, Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse/Invisible Stripes, High Sierra/They Drive by Night, Maltese Falcon/Across the Pacific, All Through the Night/Brother Orchid, Action in the North Atlantic/Passage to Marseilles, To Have and Have Not/The Big Sleep, Dark Passage/Key Largo, and Casablanca/ Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Recorded on double-sided dvds, they don't appear to have been remastered but are in good condition and present a nice composite of Bogart's Warner Brothers tenure that lasted about 14 years. While we haven't watched them all, the six that we have watched have been fun and with the features included have given us a quasi-movie theater experience when you add soft drinks and popcorn.
The selections for this set have been good. They give a fan or a novice a good cross-section of Bogart films that run the spectrum from 'b' movie to classics. Among my favorites are Black Legion and All Through The Night ('b' movies) and The Treasure of Sierra Madre and Key Largo (prestige films).
Assuming you don't have these films already, this is a decent package given the price. It presents the opportunity to acquire those films that are no longer in print at the moment. No problems with continuity or content so far. Everything is exactly as described.",1304380800,2,1944,5.155063291139241

Even though I do already own almost half of the movies in this collection, again as a Bogie fan it is a really nice collection with the included book, poster cards and reprints of movie nostalgia of Bogie. I am extremely disappointed in one defect within this collection. One of the movies, ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is completely missing from the collection even though it is listed on the box, the DVD jacket and the Amazon listing. The stand alone movie if purchased separately is a 2 disk set, the movie on disk 1 and the specials on disk 2. Where this movie should have been included in this collection what you will receive is actually disk 2 which has all of the specials however the actual movie is not included at all. This is obviously a production/packaging/distribution error however for a set that sells for $99.95, it is not a cheap knockoff and should be perfect per the advertisements for the product. I already own the missing movie so I am going to keep the collection for the movies that I did not already own in my Bogie collection. Again, I don't mind the issue and the missing movie, if you don't already own it can be bought on Amazon for about $10.00 but for the extremely high selling price of this collection, it should not be anything less than perfect.",1510272000,4,1465,4.532075471698113
