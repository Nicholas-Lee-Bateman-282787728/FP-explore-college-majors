3512759,5,B001CIOCJO,"I LOVED THIS FILM!!! One of Takashi Miike's best!!! I saw it in a move theater. I was totally amazed and knew that I HAD to buy this on DVD. Just seen that they're selling this one on a special edition Steelbook. It looks so cool! The kind of thing you want added to any DVD collection. If you're gonna buy this film make sure you look out for it on one of the 3 steelbooks.

Its the most fun Western that you'll EVER see!! I can't wait to see what Miike does next!!",1224806400,3,466,3.9574468085106385
3512760,5,B001CIOCJO,"research is showing that steelbook will have different members of the sukiyaki gang on the covers. I guess this is supposed to be limited edition but it sounds dope. For those that haven't seen this movie...CHECK IT OUT!!!it's definetly something to see. Takeshi is known throughout certain circles, but he is now a western king. Sounds like a good deal, certainly something to look for. Go Bloody Benton!!!",1224720000,5,407,5.0

3512762,5,B001CIOCJO,"Takashi Miike has blown me away with his latest classic. I saw this one on the big screen and was impressed. Highly styilized, beautifully shot, and so many classic Western references stuff in that any movie buff will be impressed. Fans of Japanese cinema and American audiences will enjoy this, I guarantee this will be a cult classic for years to come. Plus, a show-stopping cameo from a certain renegade American director (QT, anyone????)",1222214400,3,441,4.972972972972973
3512763,4,B001CIOCJO,"SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO (2007) is Takashi Miike's spin on the Asian Western. While it may not be a wholly original idea, video games have experimented on this mixing of genres such as ""Western Samurai"", Eiichi Kudo's Fort of Death (1969) and the nearest attempt at an Asian western is Hong Kong's ""Peace Hotel""; Miike's version is worth the buzz and the hype. The film exudes coolness and is surprisingly entertaining, it is a fitting tribute to Spaghetti westerns (""Sukiyaki"" instead of ""spaghetti"") and chambara (samurai) period films. Also, a certain American director who loves Asian films makes an appearance as a cowboy who eats a pot of sukiyaki. That's right, Tarantino makes an appearance as a man named Pringo (a play on Pierrot and Ringo), this man certainly knows Miike's work and has repeatedly expressed that he is a fan of the acclaimed Japanese director.

Two opposing clans, the Genji and Heiki clans have taken control of a town called Nevada. Nope, this is a Japanese Nevada where the inhabitants' native tongue is English, they`re all Japanese folks with hybrid western-Asian outfits and Japanese monikers. A lone drifter (Hideyaki Ito), who is also very good with a gun, enters the town and is forced to pick a side. The stranger is so skilled that his joining an opposite clan would most likely tip the scales. The two rival gangs (eh, clans) are fighting over a legendary hidden chest of treasure and they have driven out almost all inhabitants except for a woman named Ruriko and the eccentric town sheriff.

Sniff some Kurosawa, inhale some Gosha with a whiff of Okamoto and take 2 tablespoons of Sergio Leone three times a day; and what you have a mixed genre-busting film which blends the grittiness and coolness of spaghetti westerns with the moodiness and atmosphere of chambara/jidai geki films that is the cure for boredom. The film is a push to remind the Italians of the eternal debt they owe to Japanese Samurai films. Put a dash of a Katana sword, a Gatling gun, a lot of dynamite, gunfights and characters that are outrageously cool and you have the perfect recipe for the epitome of Asian cult films with (maybe) mass-mainstream appeal. The films' main premise itself is YOJIMBO-like or ""Fistful of Dollars"" if you prefer.

The set designs are also quite curious and very creative. The architecture of the buildings are definitely hybrids of Japanese feudal design with the usual western style. Shakespeare's War of Flowers is taken as a code of Bushido (?). The costumes are anime-inspired in their own way with a strong touch of western cinema except for the main character. Legends and mysticism also play a small part in this genre-busting extravaganza. The film definitely crosses all boundaries and the film never limits itself. The action has a touch of hard-boiled cool with the usual bullet ballet and the film's proceedings have the Tarantino-like sly and twisted humor.

Hideyaki Ito (Uzimaru 2) plays the stranger and the man definitely can pull off the essentials of a mysterious drifter. Kaori Moimoi (Love and Honor) plays a mysterious woman named Ruriko who is the mother of the deceased Akira who was also the husband of sexy Shizuka, played by Yoshino Kimura. This actress exudes raw sex appeal and has the characteristics of an ice-cold femme fatale. The camera work is excellent, Miike assisted by cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita is very impressive. The movements are fluid, facial expressions have a solidarity and the music itself calls a lot of attention.

It is a little weird that Miike would shoot this film with the performers speaking English since I've read that the man grew up watching dubbed Italian films, and disliked it. The delivery in dialogue is somewhat wanting and Miike is a master of movement as displayed in ""Izo"" and ""Dead or Alive"". I wanted to watch the film with subtitles and I found myself rewinding a few times to hear the dialogue again just so I won't miss any of the wonderful visuals. Most of the cast mumble almost phonetically and it was obvious that only Yoshino Kimura is the only one really skilled with the English language. The dialogue may hamper the film a little but believe me, not by much.

The plot itself may be a little too simple and offers not too much for the imagination. Much of the character development occurs in the form of storytelling and flashbacks. The film does exercise more on style over substance but the film is a successful exercise in freedom and versatility. The stunning visuals and camera work surpasses its spirit that some viewers may find the film a bit passive and is too commercially superficial. However, the nice and VERY cool touches in the screenplay hides its shortcomings. The legend of ""Bloody Benten"" (a woman who can give Lady Snowblood a run for her money), the mystery of Pringo, the duel between a six-shooter and a katana sword, the tale of a young boy and the unknown drifter adds a lot of quality to the film with pure popcorn entertainment. Fans of Asian cinema and Western movies will be busy enjoying the sequences and undoubtedly look for references from other cult films. If you've seen the other genre-breaking film ""Versus"", you may have an idea of what you're in for. The film has more style than substance, but it is an excellent display of Takashi Miike's more mainstream goals. The film has the crowd-pleasing appeal but will undeniably develop a cult following.

""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is a successful blend and fusion of  genres that delivers pure enjoyable entertainment, despite the bad English delivery. Takashi Miike has pulled it off again...and forgiven for the ""Great Yokai War"". (Zebraman anyone?)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4+ stars]

Note: The film is known is also known as ""My Life as McMug"" in Malaysia. Make certain you see the film with English Subs because while the dialogue is in English, it's a bit hard to make it out. I believe it may have been done intentionally.
The U.S. release will feature multiple covers (including tin covers) and will carry terrific English subtitles.
However, the GENEON region-2 Dvd I have from Japan clocks in at 120 minutes, the U.S. release has been edited to 98 minutes. While the U.S. release is a little more faster-paced, the uncut edition does have more Character development and has a better fleshed-out story.",1220486400,3,6327,4.893656716417911
3512764,4,B001CIOCJO,"Takashi Miike is the very definition of a visionary filmmaker.  To call him the most prolific director on the planet might be the understatement of the decade.  The man churns out film after film with staggering variety, endless creativity, and a lot of style while never failing to smash every boundary of taste and genre.  He's conquered the heights of truly disturbing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/horror/dp/B000GI3RHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">horror</a>, redefined&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/disgusting/dp/B00006FDBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">disgusting</a>, shown us horrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/violence/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">violence</a>, that love is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/torture/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">torture</a>, and spoofed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/superhero/dp/B000EI4N6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">superhero</a>&nbsp;genre as well while making as many as nine films in a single year.  No joke.  So having crossed every line possible, what's left?  Why not bring a katana to a gunfight and see what happens?  ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is to the western film genre what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00068ULLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;was to the martial-arts genre: a love letter in cinematic form from across the Pacific Ocean.  And sure enough, Miike-sensei brought Quentin Tarantino along for the ride.  Tighten your bootstraps, this one's a doozy.

I am not a fan of western films, but Asian cult cinema: hell yes.  I would qualify this film as an absolute must-see for either/or and I imagine there is no shortage of western references and homages that flew over my head due to my inexperience with the genre.  The title is an amusing Japanese play on the ""spaghetti western"" nickname coupled with the name of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/classic-example/dp/B000PC6Z48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">classic example</a>&nbsp;of the genre itself.  Why this is relevant doesn't reveal itself until the last scene so I won't spoil it.  The movie is almost schizophrenic (as is it's town sheriff) in it's mish-mash of styles.  Some scenes overflow with bright colors and classic Japanese imagery, other times the shots are yellowish with muted colors like a classic western and feature those sorts of settings.  One character has a holstered gun on one hip and a sheathed katana on the other.  One gang dresses in bright red -including some dyed emo-style hair- and the other in pure white.  All of the weapons are old-school, but there are modern bits like facial piercings as well.  At one point, Tarantino hints at the origin of his character's son's name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>) by declaring himself ""an anime otaku at heart"" to which the other character responds with a baffled ""what!?"".  Absolutely brilliant and uncalled for.  Exactly the kind of oddball moment one never expects, but Miike delivers anyway.  The story is a convoluted one that demands you pay attention to it, but I had to rewatch several stretches because I was utterly distracted by the bizarre nature of the film itself.  For example, the opening scene features Tarantino in front of an obviously painted background.  Blood even splatters onto it when he shoots a guy.  There is also a short-but-sweet animated flourish during one of his stories about a female gunfighter (Bloody Benton).  How can you be expected to pay attention to the dialogue when this movie is continually throwing you these kinds of visual curve-balls?  Not so much a complaint as an observation.

""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is an almost entirely English (Engrish?) language film.  While I do very much respect Miike's artistic decision to film the movie in the native language of the stories that inspired it, it does end up detracting from the quality.  It is painfully obvious at times that the actors are unaware of just what they are saying as they attempt to act while pronouncing every word phonetically.  This is not true for all of the actors, but it happens often enough to be a distraction.  The big showdown is explosive enough to make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Woo/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Woo</a>&nbsp;envious.  There is some very entertaining action, a recurring bit where a gunshot produces an explosion of feathers from off camera -which may or may not be an amusing homage to Woo himself-, some sex appeal (the image of Bloody Benton licking her sizzling gun barrel is staying with me for a while), some pretty dark humor, an entrancing and sensual dance sequence, and plenty more for film fanatics to sink their teeth into here.  You will not be disappointed.

Like the young boy in this story born of the union between red and white gang members and the beautiful two-toned roses his family tends to, this movie is neither here nor there.  It is East-meets-West to the hilt.  A perfect hybrid of offbeat Asian cinema and the traditional western.  It is utterly entertaining to fans of either and it is a damn shame that it is being butchered for American consumption.  That's right, the two-hour epic I own will lose about 20 minutes upon release in the USA.  Why?  Because the American film industry thinks we are all a bunch of ignorant hicks that will demand our money back if there is a stretch of longer than 10 minutes without something going boom.  I'm thrilled that this is getting a theatrical release in The States, however limited, but this disrespect of foreign films has got to stop.  Would they truncate<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-the-Ugly/dp/6301971272/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad & the Ugly</a>&nbsp;and the like?  Those movies are long and slow-moving.  Let's just cut out all of the ""boring stuff"" and re-release them so we aren't forced to sit through any brilliant pieces of cinema in their entirety.  If anybody in the industry has payed their dues, it's Takashi Miike, and it's about time he gets the respect afforded to the greats.  Check out ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" if the premise appeals to you in any way and a good time will be had by all.  Now off into the sunset I ride.",1217116800,6,6660,6.050106609808102
3512765,4,B001CIOCJO,"For starters, the DVD copy I have is not an American one.  It's from Malaysia and represents the original Japanese version.  Amazon lists the running time of this release as 98 mins.  The true Japanese version is 120 mins.  Since I've not seen the shorter cut I can't really comment on it.  But, as a rule of thumb, I don't like when DVD distributors start hacking away at a film because they think us in the US only watch asian movies for their action scenes.  Personally, I always recommend finding the longer versions, but it's all a matter of taste.

The only downside with the DVD version I have is that if you have trouble understanding the spoken English (an almost all-Japanese cast speaking some heavily accented English) the subtitles are pretty much useless.  It's as if they took the English script, translated it into Japanese, and then literally translated it back into English.  That means that the grammar is structured oddly and that single words are often translated into longer phrases.  So I'm assuming that will be corrected in the official release.  Now, onto the movie.

First and foremost, this is a western.  It is set in Japan and stars an all Japanese cast, save for one, lone American cameo.  I'll keep it under wraps for the few that don't want to know or haven't run across it.  But it's a cool and appropriate cameo.  Without saying too much about the story, it's basically about a lone rider who comes into town to help the locals when two warring gangs overrun the town looking for rumored treasure.

As I stated before, the all Japanese cast speaks in almost entirely English throughout the entire film.  Once you get used to it you can make out what they're saying.  But some will struggle at first.  Since most are not native speakers, it sounds as if they learned their lines phonetically, without any knowledge of English.  It makes for some odd cadences and pauses.  To be honest, I kind of enjoyed it.  It seemed like a fun and interesting idea.  It just adds to the genre-bending of the whole film.

While the film is a western, it successfully balances the fine line between serious western and stylish action/comedy.  Some may feel uneasy because it never settles into one or the other.  Some very serious and heavy moments can be immediately followed by one of the over-the-top characters doing some schtick.  Personally, I thought it flowed well and maintained the balance.  Some reviewers have called it confused.  In my opinion, I enjoy movies that refuse to be defined and just be what they should.

As well as being a western on its face, Django also has many elements of the old Kurosawa samurai flicks (one is even referred to in the film).  The original film series 'Django' is also homaged numerous times.

The action is slick and well paced.  Very stylish and creative in some areas, comedic in others, and once in a while just downright rough and tumble.  Those looking for an all-out asian action flick may be a little disappointed by the films pace.  It is paced like a spaghetti western: Deliberate and dramatic.  When the action comes, it is explosive and will not disappoint.  But the scenes in-between aren't just vehicles to take us to the next gunfight.  There is a narrative, there is character development, there are backstories and conflicts that are born and resolved.

Django is a very complete and entertaining film.  The spoken language and genre-bending will challenge some viewers while alienating others, altogether.  But for those interested in the genre and don't mind something a little different, Django is a solid pick.",1216512000,4,3597,4.7727272727272725
3512770,2,B001CIOCJO,"In the preface to his book on Spaghetti Westerns Chris Frayling lists a number of labels journalists have attached to other Westerns not made in the USA. Theres the Sauerkraut Western (coming from Germany), the Paella Western coming from Spain, Camembert Westerns produced at Fontainebleau, Chop Suey Westerns coming from Hong Kong and even Curry Westerns made in India. In 1977 there was even a Borsch Western coming out of Russia titled Armed and Very Dangerous. Here we have a Sukiyaki Western so named because it comes from Japan and perhaps is a little more hip-sounding than Sushi Western. The other part of the title refers to Sergio Corbuccis classic Spaghetti Django (1966) which is a variation on the same 18th Century play by Carlo Goldoni entitled Servant of Two Masters which inspired Sergio Leones A Fistful of Dollars (1964). The first Sukiyaki Westerns I suppose were Kurosawa Akiras Yojimbo (1961) and its sister film Sanjuro (1962), but then the Japanese master got to the Goldoni story before Leone and the culinary naming trend took off. Interestingly, the same story also exists in Dashiel Hammets first novel Red Harvest which Bernardo Bertolucci wasted years failing to make in Hollywood and which finally reached the screen in the shape of the Coen brothers Millers Crossing (1990). The noir connection was made most obvious perhaps in Walter Hills redundant Bruce Willis vehicle Last Man Standing (1996). What we have in Sukiyaki Western Django (2007) then is a story first borrowed from the Italian Goldoni, stolen by the Japanese Kurosawa, stolen back by the Italian Leone and now stolen again by the Japanese Miike Takashi who adds the extra ingredient of tying the Goldoni original back to the old samurai tradition in a revival of the Genji-Heike rivalry which started off the whole samurai era of Japanese history.

So far so interesting for the Spaghetti Western fan, but somewhat problematically the film is directed by Miike Takashi, a name which will turn off as many viewers as it will attract. Miike enjoys a strong cult following especially overseas. Here in Japan he is a notorious figure known for films which deliberately provoke audiences with extreme material which pushes what is permissible in the eyes of the censors to the limit. Nobody will forget Ichi the Killer (2001) in a hurry with its stomach-churning violence so repulsive that barf bags were issued to audiences when it was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. Then theres Visitor Q (2000) which is a full-blooded assault on the Japanese shmin-geki with its bouncy ingredients of incest, drug abuse, sado-masochism and necrophilia, the main characters penis ending up stuck inside a corpse which has turned rigor mortis. To side-step the censors Miike has made roughly half of his huge output (over 90 films!) on video. These received limited release at the time but most of which have seen the light of day on DVD thanks to enthusiastic support from his small band of noisy followers.

Miike fans and anyone who just knows his name will know what to expect in Sukiyaki Western Django which is well up to standard with its bizarre violence and ludicrous off-the-wall OTT stylistics. The most bizarre feature can possibly be attributed to the linguistic skills (or lack of) of one Quentin Tarantino whose mumbled jumbled cameo-introduction sets up the central Genji-Heike rivalry in the films prologue. Even though this is a Japanese film made primarily for Japanese audiences, all the characters speak in pseudo Tarantino-ese, a kind of pidgin English which thankfully is subtitled in English (even Tarantino himself!). Wandering out of the Nevata Desert into a divided town called Yuta comes our eponymous Man with No Name (Ito Hideaki). The plot needs no explanation, I mean we all know what happens, right? In the red (Heike) corner is Kiyomori (Sat Kichi) and his colorful band of followers. In the white (Genji) corner is Yoshitsune (Iseya Yusuke) and his equally designer-conscious brethren. In the middle is the weak Sheriff Hoanka (Kagawa Teruyuki) playing comic relief and the woman Shizuka (Kimura Yoshino) who has sold herself to the Genjis to protect her son Heihachi (Uchida Ruka) who is half Heike/half Genji. Looking over everything is the inn-keeper Ruriko (Momoi Kaori). The Man with No Name does the Shane thing protecting the kid by playing off both sides of the town against each other while Ruriko does the Vienna/Joan Crawford (Johnny Guitar) thing by coming out eventually all guns blazing feminist-style.

The film is certainly entertaining, but the OTT style and the incessant crash bang wallop desire to shock and then to shock better is relentless and eventually self-defeating. Exaggerated stylistics are all par the course for Spaghetti Westerns and this isn't perhaps so much a fault as it was in Confessions (Tatsuya Nakashima, 2010), a Japanese junior high school drama which I have just reviewed. One central fault is shared between the two films. Neither offers a charismatic/sympathetic central lead character. The problem is not in the acting which seems to be very good in both (the incessant machine gun editing makes it difficult to tell), but in this one Itos Man with No Name just cannot compare with Eastwoods, Mifunes or even with Franco Neros in the original Django. What Leone, Kurosawa and Corbucci have is a central love and understanding of what they are doing and they are all careful to make the lead character highly distinctive with focuses on details and personal mannerisms which ultimately become endearing  Mifunes tooth pick or Eastwoods cigar. Miike is too busy playing the detached observer looking in from outside in a very self-conscious way. He examines a genre which seems not to matter much to him. What matters most here are the multiple quotes to other films (it would be laborious and pointless to name them all), the jokes and clever cultural references (the Wars of the Roses through Shakespeare?), how to make someone die stylishly, how to shock through use of special fx (Eg; a shot of a clean hole blown straight through a body which is still standing) and how ultimately to be cool or hip while shocking as much as possible. Dont get me wrong, I am not in the anti-Miike camp. I thought Visitor Q was very interesting indeed and I intend to explore more of his films, but this one doesnt succeed mainly because unlike Leone, Kurosawa and Corbucci he doesnt really convince us that he identifies with or even likes his material. Others might think differently of course. Perhaps for me the constant quoting of other films underlines how this film never for one second approaches any of them in terms of quality  a spoilt brat little pup yapping at the heels of fully grown majestic wolves. Quoting other films is fine if you do something with it (Leones majestic Once Upon a Time in the West [1968] is probably the supreme example for me), but if you do it just for superficial effect then the word for it is pretentious. Even Tarantino managed more depth in his Kill Bill films simply because he cares about his material and he is something of a pup himself compared with Kurosawa and Leone.

This DVD is the cut 98 minute version prepared by Miike for release overseas. The original version runs 121 minutes and to my knowledge hasn't been shown abroad after its Venice Festival premiere in 2007. No problems with the picture or the sound. The subtitles are clear and easy to read.",1473033600,,7460,4.949720670391062

Rating = ***
Director:  Takashi Miike
Producers:  Nobuyuki Tohya et al.
DVD
2007

Film = three (3) stars; cinematography/lighting = 3.5 stars; editing/continuity = 2.5 stars; translation = one (1) star.  Director Takashi Miike delivers an ambiguous tale of samurai gun slingers (or is it cowboy sword swingers?) in the blood thirsty style of Quentin Tarantino who shows up in bookend cameo appearances (see below).  Miike's fantasy film crams virtually every motion-picture myth from the Italian brand of the American Old West into the scenario pot (including the music) plus some clever original variations such as:  a shootout at high (give or take) noon that occurs during a snow storm; yakuza ancestors in the form of rival red and white town gangs who, of course, wear only red or white, respectively (to help the viewer determine which side a stunt actor is now on?); samurai sword moves that deflect six-gun bullets; a hand-held Gatling gun with two-foot clip (for holding thousands of rounds?); a lynching torii gate at the edge of town (instead of a lone leafless tree); the usual cluttered boot hill but with both above and below ground ""burials""; saloon dancing entertainment that substitutes floor slithering for high kicking; and gold that looks freshly minted instead of freshly mined (so there's no mistaking it for fool's gold?).  Acting is not so great and may have been negatively impacted by requiring all players to their deliver lines entirely in English (there is no voice-acting dubbing).  Actresses and actors  speak ""high English"" rather than ""cowboy lingo,"" but retain the usual rising and falling intoneations spoken by native Japanese (with a sentence-ending ""ne"" occasionally slipping out!).  Stunt actors are kept busy dying many, many times as either Red Gang or White Gang members.  Costumes are especially interesting.  No one wears a white hat, since there are no ""good guys"" (some members of the Red Gang do wear white hachimaki [headbands], though).  These yakuza fore runners also care a lot about there appearances, since their costumes always look brand new (including their baseball jackets!) as do their vast assortment of firearms and leather accessories (a gun collector's dream!).  Special effects are modest but very well done.  Editing and continuity are not quite there.  The film is too long and sags when the satire hits a dry spot.  Scenes often switch back and forth between sunshine, heavy (real not movie) rain, and snow (a lot of it).  There is too much reliance on voice-over expository to fill in the gaps.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and scene lighting are fine.  Surround-sound field is OK, but seems under used.  Interior set used for the opening scenes features Tarantino as a gun fighter reacting to especially spicy sukiyaki in front of a painted back drop that includes the Japanese flag (way before it was adopted?) and Mount Fuji (closing interior scenes features an ancient Tarantino as a gun-shop proprietor zipping around in a racing wheel chair!).  Some signs (including the town's name) are only partially translated. The English subtitle menu is confusing (since the film has only English dialog).  (These subtitles are meant for the hard of hearing.)  Credits are not translated which seems to be an especially disrespectful action by the film's director/producers directed against all those who helped to make this English-language movie possible!

3512829,5,B001CIOCJO,"This review is for Sukiyaki Western Django [Blu-ray 2-disc version] A beautiful looking creative eclectic horse ride journey through a revisionist homage that honors the classic Euro Western as it creates it's own unique world. Just as Italian Westerns (""Spaghetti Westerns"") made in the 1960s took the American Western movie to a new place, SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO is an extreme progression trasporting the Wild-Western to the next level. The fact that the film is a sort of loose pre-quel to the original ""Django"" (1966) may be an ironic symbol that the historic setting is way ahead of it's time and thus, difficult for mainstream audiences to appreciate.  Never mind the plot, it is the over-saturated colors, stunning visuals, eccentric characters with super-human gun-slinging, sword wielding talents in amazingly funny situations that make this an unforgettable and entertaining film. Blu-ray disc also includes a wonderful 50-minute behind the scenes making of the film documentary complete with interviews with key players. It is a nice addition to the package and makes one appreciate the pain-staking efforts that went into making the creative film.

3512831,5,B001CIOCJO,"Finally we get to see my favorite writer/director collaborate with my second favorite director in this absolute visual,cinema mayhem. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite and seeing as he is a huge fan of japanese cinema and it's most daring and brilliant film maker Takashi Miike  (my second favorite director)it was really cool to see him take part in this his best film to date in my opinion. Yes it is shot entirely in english but not dubbed,yes the violence is a bit more tame then in previous Miike works (Dead or Alive,Ichi the Killer) but still ultra over the top Miike violence,and it combines the styles of Gangster film and Western. What could be better?I think it's Miike's most accomplished film to date,everything about it is awesome the style,storyline(which is almost identical to Last Man Standing but vastly different)and the action is non-stop and truly the best ever scene in terms of western flick. Lots of explosions,gunfights,swordfights,and yes a mini-gun hidden in a casket. The plot is simple and like I stated earlier has been used before but has a cool twist in this one. Two rival gangs fighting for whats left of a town and the whereabouts of a hidden treasure,a corrupt sheriff,and a mysterious gunslinger who both factions try and employ. Then thrown in the middle is another mysterious gunslinger Tarantino's character who play's as the narrarator and the one who connects the dot's. Don't forget the black humor Miike is infamous for, this film has it as well. An all around guilty pleasure for any fan of the crime noir and spaghetti western genre's and fans of Tarantino and Miike. This is a fast-paced,violent,and epic film that has been kinda bashed by reviewers and critics either because extreme Miike fans are not happy with the english and the toned down sex and violence to me those people like the mans work purely for it's shock value and probably fast forward Audition to the last 20 minutes or watch the opening and ending of Dead or Alive and don't get me wrong his film violence and depravity is one of a kind and very entertaining,just because it's toned down a bit and we don't see guts and face's ripped off is not a bad thing. This film is more about action then violence which is refreshing to see Miike can film solid action scenes with out shocking us and covering us in blood or noodles(Dead or Alive yuck)and the back of the film says there's a rape but I really didn't see one.the performances are top notch the Japanese cast is awesome my favorite is the leader of the White's gang,his post modern cowboy look is so sick,piercings,kick ass swordsman,and really steals the show. The gunslinger is awesome to,like a japanese Mickey Rourke,and the females are beautiful as always(i'm a sucker for asian women) and QT kicks ass. So there you have it Sukiyaki:Western Django is every bit is good as anticipated,and truly is Takashi Miike's english language masterpiece and in my opinion his best film to date.",1382918400,,2960,4.803921568627451

My boyfriend convinced me that it is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but has a fantastic plot nonetheless. I can't think of a better way to describe it. This has quickly become my favorite movie. Yes, they are japanese actors trying to speak English. Yes, sometimes it's difficult to understand. No, the cinematography did not suffer because of the aforementioned. It is something different. I can't say I've ever taken to a western film quite like I've taken to this one. To quote another reviewer who described the only downside to the film best:

""Sukiyaki Western Django is probably too dense, too post-modern and intertextual for most audiences, and is a failure on that level.  Intertexuality should never come at the cost of understandability, and Miike cannot expect viewers to all already know the following texts:  Heike no Monogatari, Django, Yojimbo, Fistful of Dollars, Akira, etc. as well as having a genre knowledge of westerns, samurai dramas and Japanese history/culture, the War of the Roses and Shakespeare.

3512837,4,B001CIOCJO,"Sukiyaki Western Django (Takashi Miike, 2007)

I kind of got off track with Takashi Miike there for a while, and I've been scurrying to catch up over the last year or so. Turns out that Miike's work is just as fun over the past decade as it was during the earlier years. Why didn't anyone tell me until 13 Assassins? Case in point: Sukiyaki Western Django, Miike's remake/reimagining/reboot/Miike-ization of Django, a Sergio Corbucci spaghetti western from the sixties, with heavy influences from Heike Monogatari, though updated to spaghetti-western times. All of which plays second fiddle to the fact that it's a Takashi Miike movie, and is thus, in the parlance, [censored for Amazon consumption] insane.

There is a plot, though it's secondary; a nameless gunslinger (Umizaru's Hideaki It) rides into a town divided and offers his services as a gunslinger up to the side willing to pay him the most. Yep, that's pretty much it. There's a framing narrative featuring Quentin Tarantino, who's relating the story while cooking up a mess of sukiyaki, but that, like the plot, is just an excuse to get a bunch of characters into a bunch of situations where they're trying to shoot each other.

This sort of basically-plotless silliness works or doesn't based entirely on the director's style. In other words, if you're a Miike fan, this is going to be right up your alley, and if you're not, you're going to hate it with a burning heat of a thousand suns. And while I am (obviously, if you've been following my reviews since I first discovered Miike some fifteen years ago) very much of the former camp, I can understand some of the criticisms the latter camp throws at the movie. Miike isn't really doing anything new here, and he's not exactly going out of his way to make this film accessible to those new to Miike's work. These are not good qualities for a director to develop; one runs the risk of becoming so solipsistic that one's movies become meaningful only to the director and to the few who have obsessively followed that director enough to understand the director's personal filmic language. (Hollis Frampton immediately comes to mind, as does Kenneth Anger, though neither of them started out doing commercial work. Jon Jost, perhaps?) And thus I'm not ranking it as high on the list as something like 13 Assassins or The Bird People in China, movies that exemplify the Miike craziness but are still accessible enough that casual Miike fans, or even people generally unfamiliar with his work, can latch onto and enjoy.

Not one for beginners, but a ball if you know what you're getting into. *** ",1358380800,,2609,4.827740492170022

One character in particular needed to be cut or at least rewritten (the sherriff doing a Smeagle routine of dueling split personalities).  The story and visuals are worth watching.  Some elements just don't work for US tastes... such as the two rape scenes.  It could have been implied or just mentioned for purpose of story without acting it out.  And my fanboy appreciation of Tarantino can't stop me from saying his whole role should have been cut.  I have watched the movie a few times and am happier if I skip his parts.

Takashi Miike is one of my all time favorite filmmakers and for good reason I think, he makes highly entertaining films. Whether they are pure genius classics or just straight fun and entertaining I have enjoyed them all, from the all time classic ""Audition"" all the way to this one and beyond. Add in that my favorite filmmaker Quentin Tarantino is in this insanely fun flick and it makes for a great time. Taking a bit from another Western Django by Sergio Corbucci and with a mix of other films influence mixed in Miike takes us on a fun ride.

The film is about a small town called Nevada in which a treasure chest is said to exist with all kinds of, you guessed it, treasure inside. This of course brings in all kinds of baddies like two clans who want the chest for themselves of course. Neither side wants the other to find it so they both live in the town running out the locals and waging war on one another. That is until a lone gunman [Hideyaki Ito] walks into town and walks right into the battle; of course each side wants him on their side. So the battle rages on with each side trying to get this man on their side as the body count rises and the action/comedy picks up.

The look of this film is amazing mixing the spaghetti western and samurai styles and looks together in a very intriguing hybrid. The sets and costumes are marvelous and just add to the fun that is taking place before you. The action in this film is extremely fun as well mixing in martial arts with all kinds of gunplay and explosions, all you could ever ask for. The humor here is great as well ranging from just extravagant like shooting into the wind as to hit your target when it brings you back, to the stylized and gritty humor that Tarantino himself is known for.

Speaking of Tarantino you can tell he was having all kinds of fun here especially since he always wanted to act. Any one who knows his history and style they know he was perfect to be the westerner in this film. Hideyaki Ito is perfect as well as the love gunman that walks into town and pulls off the role nicely. Kaori Moimoi, Yoshino Kimura, and the entire cast as well are just so terrific in this film, it is really great.

Miike has crafted a super fun style over substance [if we are being honest] film that has that mainstream appeal at the same time it will be a cult classic, hard to do. From the wonderful cinematography to the over the top action all his here one could ever want. There are all kinds of other styles and films blended into this one movie and it is fun seeing all of them if you are fan of any of the films that are referenced. This may not be the best movie ever made but it is a runner for most fun for sure, any movie with a scene were one man can catch a sword before it slices into his head and the next man can't [hilarious scene] is great in my book.",1293062400,,2869,4.237659963436928

The Blu-Ray version cuts a bit over 20 minutes from the original cut - disappointing!

Video is a bit iffy - some scenes look GREAT, some are so highly-stylized  that they're hard to judge (I'm a huge fan of saturation, fast cuts and cross processing, but this took it to a whole new level, even outdoing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Domino-Blu-ray/dp/B001H7QCFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Domino  [Blu-ray</a>]. Overall I'd give it about a 4/5 because there is a lot of detail.. you just can't really tell in the stylized scenes.

Audio was good too - no DTS, but a nice mix.

Subtitles, which I usually don't care about, would have been great. The movie uses japanese actors speaking english so it's hard to understand at times -- the only subtitles included (for english at least) are ""closed captions"" that write out any sound effects on the screen for you.

The extras are pretty light, but whats on there is good - the Behind the Scenes runs nearly an hour.

It had a stupid, pointless, opening with Quentin Tarantino, and I hoped it would get more interesting from there, but it never really did.  I like the concept of an asian western, but this story really didn't capture my interest.

However, for this ""boomer"" who grew up with Trigger, Gene, Jimmy and John, I can tell you once and for all if you want to again feel the longing of a man sitting upon his horse who is about to finish a 4-month trip pushed 2,200 longhorns north up the Chisholm Trail all the while longing for his family waiting for him back at their central Texas ranch, or of a man riding hard and fast from the law, while rubbing his backside raw from the saddle upon the horse he has `borrowed' while making his way to pick up the trail of the man who murdered his wife and son and framed him for this crime for which he was convicted, then you're wasting your money and wasting your time. I'm a big fan of the classic Japanese samurai swordsmen movies including the `Blind Swordsmen' series and also of several different styles of the American Western movie genre. Some call this new style of movie artistic and that I just don't ""get it"". Well, perhaps they're right. I may not be able to produce a western movie today with great artistic value which will hold up for generations to come. But, I know a quality western when I see it, one with a great story, a believable cast, locations with beautiful vistas, all the while with a powerful and supportive sound track. This movie fails on every one of these elements. My two cents is to keep your two cents, partner.",1267833600,4,1973,4.544943820224719

All I could do was keep listening to the poor dialect while having the movie in subtitles if I couldn't understand what they said. For all you guys who care more about action then story telling you will still be disappointed with lackluster gun and sword play don't get me wrong there was some good action scenes but none can excuse the movie poor excuse of a story line and character development.

Outside of that, there are some deleted scenes, the trailers, some totally unrelated trailers and the usual language options.  The unrelated trailers show up when the DVD starts up, but can be skipped, apparently.  Gotta have trailers, reminds me of VHS.  I used to have one of those, but it had problems, and eventually someone threw it away.  It had ben disassembled partly to make it work, so it sort of looked like rash at the time, I guess.  Missing are director/cast commentary, but the last time I saw a DVD from this director it was in japanese, and like so many people outside of that particular country I can't understand a whole lot in japanese.

The film itself:

This movie does not take itself seriously at all.  Not that Miike Takeshi films on the whole do that a lot.  It is a bizarre hybrid Samurai film / spaghetti western, which is amusing since so many spaghetti westerns were blatant rip offs of samurai films to begin with.  ""Magnificent seven"" and ""Fistful of dollars"" being the most notable examples.  The samurai films tended to steal from Shakespeare, so the whole thing has now gone full circle and is about to make a new round.

Everybody speaks english, correctly but with a distinct accent.  There seems to be some budget; the sets alone must have cost at least 30 million yen, and the whole thing is set high upon a moor somewhere and involves loads of extras.

The plot doesn't really matter, since the whole movie can be seen as just one weird scene after another, spaced closely enough together to keep one interested.  And the scenes are spectacular and memorable and make sense in context... most of the time.

But it doesn't matter what I say.  If you deliberately buy something called ""Sukiyaki Western Django,"" knowing it was directed by Miike Takeshi you are probably a fan of the genre and an anime otaku at heart and know full well what you are getting into.

Instead of the electrifying dialogue of a Tarantino movie, we have only an echo of his overindulgence.
Instead of the depth and symbolism of a samurai movie, we have.. well, frankly all this has in common is that the actors are the same nationality.
Clearly set out as a homage to the Leone Western, we get a complete retread of the classic Yojimbo, (previously remade as A Fistful of Dollars, and Last Man Standing), set utterly anachronistically in a Japanese setting, but with Western trappings.  There is nothing about the story OR the visuals that make sense, even though you might occasionally gawp at some undeniably original visual motifs.  The script - well, if it ever did make sense, it is so butchered by a Japanese cast murdering the English language, it's impossible to tell.
If only they had just had the actors speak in their own language.  Or if only they had just made it set in a true Western environment.  If only they had Tarantino rework the script instead of give a blink and you'll miss it cameo.

Here is the gist: In Nevada, two gangs, the Heiki and Genji (represented by the colors Red and White) are at war over the town's local gold mine, and have essentially driven out the population. Enter an unnamed gunslinging stranger who is trying to set the town right, and gets involved in the aftermath of a tragic love affair. What ensues is a garish and confusing mass of flashbacks, gunfights, philosophizing, and blood that has no semblance of plot whatsoever. And that's about it.

The problem with SWD is that it has all the excesses of a 1960s spaghetti western, but none of the philosophical underpinnings or basic character interest to make it a compelling film. The ""hero"" who comes into town is actually not seen for 75% of the film and is ineffectual; neither the Reds or the Whites are clearly differentiated - they're just two evil gangs. Even the townsfolk (with the exception of the eccentric sheriff) are essentially nonentities, as listless as the late autumn landscape. Quentin Tarantino, I believe, served as one of the producers of the film, and has a small acting part in it which lends the film a little bit of kitsch appeal. What can be said for SWD is its art direction - the sets and costumes, while certainly wild and weird, are nonetheless effective, eye-catching, and well done. The film is certainly enjoyable to look at. That said, SWD, while not entirely unwatchable (there are actually some fairly effective and well-choreographed fight scenes, especially towards the end), is close.",1250985600,2,2381,6.2782874617737

It is very hard to follow what is being said because the voices are very low compared to all the other audio, I imagine if you crank up the volume the problem would not be as bad, but it is ridiculous that you should have to blow your ear drums out in the action sequences just so you can hear what they are saying during the dialogue sequences.

The plot of SWD is similar to Fistful Of Dollars.  A lone gunslinger comes into a small town where two rival gangs are feuding over buried gold.  He tries to play both sides, but a war breaks out with him caught in the middle.  That's about all the plot that needs explaining.
I don't claim to be Miike's number one fan by any means, but I'll admit I was intrigued by the idea of him doing this kind of movie.  Visually it's pretty awesome and a very nice mix of samurai and western images.  As to be expected in a Japanese film, the violence and action are very stylized, over the top and cartoony.  Though quite violent, it's not as brutal or gory as some of Miike's other films.  There are homages to classic spaghetti westerns sprinkled throughout and those very familiar with that genre will pick up on these.  At the end of the movie there's even a version of the theme song from Corbucci's Django sung in Japanese!!
Many folks might check this out coz of the Tarantino name across the box, but his role is more or less a cameo.  Plus, I'm quite sure the average moviegoer will turn this film off after ten minutes coz it strays rather far from the modern mainstream formula.
I don't think this is a film I'll want to watch over and over again, but I definitely think it's worth seeing once at least.  Naturally fans of Miike will check it out, but I'd actually recommend this one to spaghetti western fans as well.",1237075200,2,1663,4.3603896103896105

When I got my hands on it, it was initially exactly what I thought it would be.  A hokey tongue in cheek homage to the American western.  The ridiculous idea that the American prospecting culture that was prevalent in the old us westerns, not only exists but all of the caricatures of the culture also thrive.  If  you can get past the idea that the western culture did not exist, and the seeming anachronisms with weaponry and style, then you can truly enjoy what I am not afraid to call a great movie.  The entire cast speaks English throughout the movie, and it is obviously not everyones first language...so that to me was impressive.  Moments of comic relief occur when the actors unknowingly put the emphasis on the wrong syllable, or simply say an old American slang term incorrectly.  Between the great action, the brilliant direction and a superb job done by all of the cast...I feel this unknown jem will go down in the annals of cinematic history as one of the best..if not the only one...of it's kind.",1234224000,,1127,4.53960396039604
3512947,2,B001CIOCJO,"The great Japanese directors tend to make quality films most of the time despite a few duds here and there (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Shinya Tsukamoto, etc.). This is not the case with Takashi Miike. He can hit a homerun once in a while (""Audition"" (1999), ""Box"" (2004)) and produce very good films on a timely basis (""Fudoh: The New Generation"" (1996)), but a sizable number of his films range from mediocre (""Shinjuku Triad Society"" (1995)) to horrible (""Izo"" (2004)). ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" (aka SWD) isn't quite as bad as ""Izo"", but in all honesty it's not that far off.

First and foremost, Miike needs to stop directing English language movies. ""Imprint"" (2006) was an earlier project that suffered greatly from poorly delivered dialogue. There are a number of very good Japanese actors in SWD, but they all end up sounding like halfwits because they speak in English for the entirety of the film. SWD desperately needed Japanese dialogue for no other reason than to eliminate that constant uncomfortability that the actors emanated from speaking a language that they have little to no experience speaking. I would not be surprised if half of the cast spoke with limited phonetic practice. Could you imagine if Robert DeNiro tried to speak Japanese throughout a full-length movie? Rest assured that it would not turn out well.

If that weren't bad enough, the script is pathetic. It's no understatement to say that virtually every line of dialogue is utterly worthless and every attempt at humor falls flat on its face. Miike has a history of making me angry with some of the juvenile trash that makes its way into some of his films. SWD has a number of scenes that seem to be added for no good reason than to annoy the viewer. Now don't misunderstand me, because when Miike does a WTF moment, it's usually pretty cool. Here they're just stupid.

There are a few positives to this film, however. The final gun battle was pretty good, but most of the preceding shootouts were mediocre at best. There were also a few nice bits of cinematography, but nothing could have saved this movie from being an uninspired mess with little in terms of entertainment value. I love my wild, wacky, over-the-top Japanese action, but SWD can't hang it's hat on anything memorable whatsoever. For the purpose of comparison, Ryuhei Kitamura's ""Azumi"" (2003) is a near masterpiece of over-the-top cinema, with fantastic characters and energetic fight scenes that make SWD look like amateur hour. It pains me to see Miike fanboys pining over this turd when ""Azumi"" gets almost no credit for being one of the single greatest action movies in motion picture history.

I'm not sure if Miike was selling out with this movie or not. With English dialogue and a guest appearance from Quentin Tarantino, one could be forgiven for suspecting this. All I know is that one of the ""most useful"" comments on IMDb praised this piece of rat-infest dog crap while (at the very same time, no less) trashing ""Audition"" (1999) for being ""boring"" and ""cliche."" If this is the kind of moviegoer that Miike pandered to with SWD, then he'd better wake up and stop making films for the ""Indy 4"" crowd.",1233792000,2,3171,4.834254143646409
3512948,1,B001CIOCJO,"Sukiyaki Western Django is a loose remake of A Fist Full of Dollars or Yojimbo (the former being a remake of the latter): two warring gangs, a small town, a lost treasure, and a lone drifter who appears out of nowhere and pits the gangs against each other.

At times the film is visually stunning similiar in style to Tears Of The Black Tiger and true to Takashi Miike's form and reputation there's a lot of over-the-top comedic violence.

However, my one beef that made me rate this a one star movie isn't the fact that Quentin Tarantino appears in the opening scene of the movie, although that is reason enough to give this zero stars. It's because Miike had the bright idea (or someone convinced him it was a good idea, Tarantino perhaps?) that it would be cool if the all Japanese cast spoke English or Engrish, if you will.

Now, I'm not being insulting but when English clearly isn't the second or third language of your actors why have them memorize lines in English and then deliver them in such a thick, heavyhanded way with accents on the wrong syllables? Half the time I had no clue what they were saying. At least there is a slight respite when the handful of actors I could tell who actually do speak English as a second language were on screen.

I get the camp factor that Miike was going for but it fails miserably. I would have enjoyed this much more if it was in Japanese with subtitles. I probably would have understood the subplots more too!

What modern directors have failed to recognize that a western IS NOT just an action/thriller genre, but should have a significant plot and dialogue written to support the scenes where the real action takes place. And surprisingly, a Japanese Horror Director has fully embraced, and faithfully executed, a true descendant of the genre.

And although there are modern style cues and the cgi effects and somewhat racier content, there is still the classic western plotline; rival gangs competing for the cache of gold in a small western town.

Miike's departure from his typical shock-horror film roots has once again shown the viewer that you should watch his films with little expectations, because whatever you may possibly predict the film to be, he will show you the complete opposite. When I first watched this movie, I expected a samurai slash fest thinly disguised with a Clint Eastwood-like Japanese actor and a weak ""gold rush"" plotline. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film is truly a spaghetti western for todays audience. While the broken phonetic english is hard to follow in the beginning, after you acclimate your ears to it, it becomes surprisingly simple to understand, and the Japanese cultural touches, like the eastern style pagoda-ish saloons, the man-powered ""covered wagons,"" the blend between samurai armor and riding chaps, all blend together well to create a believable cowboy/samurai community.

For those of you who have trouble listening to a slightly broken dialect, who want a shoot 'em up western style, with little progressive plotline, and who can't look past the cultural mashup to see that this film is truly a masterpiece of east-meets-west genre blending, then don't see this film. It is for the person who can sit and just enjoy the movie for what it is; a ""Sukiyaki"" western, showing that other nations can provide an interesting perspective on a decidedly ""American"" genre, while providing an entertaining story line, plenty of jaw-dropping action, and enough black humor and love-interest to keep any film fan entertained for the entirety.

3512966,1,B001CIOCJO,"This parody of a Spaghetti Western, crazily bizarre and wonderful although thoroughly unwatchable has the look and feel of something Salvador Dali has made by grafting Kurosawa to Leone and then adding his own surrealist interpretation of Shakespeare's Henry V.
Just as Hegel thought he witnessed the end of history through, I believe, Napoleon, Miike seems to be making the final word on Post-Modernism.
The premise, roughly speaking, is the same as that found in Kurosawa's Yojimbo, the setting is 'Nevada' Japan.  In Miike's vision, Nevada is peopled by Japanese from the 1600's Samurai era who also happen to wield six shooters and wear western gear ala USA of the 1870's.
The action takes place between two rival clans claiming ownership of the town (The Reds and the Whites, ala Shakespeare or the Eastern and Western armies ala the Sengoku period in Japan, etc.).
The action is comprised of all manner of superhuman special effects, most done with lots of over the top gore and the satirical use of preposterous special effects.
The visuals are splendid, in fact, the problem is that the dialogue is entirely in the English and it is obvious that most of the actors learned their lines phonetically and don't really know how to speak English.  As such, it is very difficult to follow the dialogue which gets tedious rather quickly.  Also, the story-line is thin gruel and ceases to remain engaging once the effects of the visually resplendent cast wears off.

3512969,4,B001CIOCJO,"When I saw this trailer, I knew I must see the movie!

Sukiyaki Western Django is an ambitious attempt to place Japanese sensibilities in to a uniquely American genre: the western. While it is essentially a remake of A Fist Full of Dollars, Sukiyaki Western Django is at once so much more and so much less. To quote another western, it is ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.""

The Good:
The film is beautifully shot. There is no denying it. There are some scenes which leave you dumbfounded. Instead of going for easy outs or cliche shots, Takashi Miike works to create a stunningly believable movie. The gun fights are exciting and full of drama. There is a real sense of tension and drama.

Instead of taking the easy way out (""everybody was kung fu fighting"") the film tries to stick with a traditional western. The bar fights are fist fights. The showdowns are gun fights. There is no ninja action. There is no karate. Everyone behaves as you would expect in this world.

The costumes and scenery deserve a special mention. When I talk about Japanese sensibilities in a western film, nowhere is it more obvious than in the costumes and set pieces. While the characters are dressed in dusters and chaps, those same items are painted with kimono-style prints. The town taverns are western at the base, and pagodaed at the top. It makes for a surreal, yet fitting stage for this movie.

The Bad:
All the actors in this film are Japanese, yet they all speak English. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if they all spoke English WELL. Unfortunately, it is clear that some of them are speaking phonetic English and having a lot of difficulty with it. About thirty minutes in to the film, I turned on the subtitles. It made it much easier to understand the actors and follow the film. I would have preferred that the director either a: had the actors speaking in Japanese then over-dub in English (a la the old spaghetti westerns) or b: had the actors speak Japanese then put up subtitles (since I ended up needing them anyway!).

Also, even with the subtitles on, the film is difficult to follow. Characters pop up and disappear with no real reason or warning. While the main characters are compelling, the supporting characters (which should add to the film) are a real detraction. I could have lived without the schizophrenic Sheriff. I think he was played for a comedic effect that was not needed in the film.

The Ugly:
Two words: Quintin Tarentino. He shows up in this film for a total of ten minutes and really stinks up the place. He opens the film in a surreal, painted stage set, speaking in a horribly indistinguishable accent. He is there to introduce the concept and background of the movie. It could have been done easier and more effectively through a bit of text on the screen.

Overall I am glad I watched this movie. While it is not the best movie I have seen lately, it is one that sticks with you. You find yourself thinking back to the action scenes, to the sets, to the costumes, and imagining what could have been. This film really had the opportunity to be the next Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Too bad it fell short. But, you can't fault them for trying!

3512970,4,B001CIOCJO,"Recipe for Film: Begin with one female assassin/warrior (Kaori Moimoi) worthy of the Goddess Kali in her most destructive form and place her in an 1800's Asian/western setting (Asian western?). Then find a tall, mysterious actor (Hideyaki Ito) who can pull off a Clint Eastwood-like persona to play the new stranger in town and another actor (Masanobu Yoichi) in an adversarial role who looks like he just stepped out of an Anime drawing. Simmer slowly while adding a generous portion of Kurosawa nihilism for 121 minutes until the screen is red with blood and just about everyone's dead. Dinner..., I mean entertainment is served!

That in a nutshell is Takashi Miilke's 'Sukiyaki Western Django'. If you enjoy; surreal imagery, subtle (and not so subtle) parody, faux depth and lots of death and destruction this is the film for you.

The group consensus was that while we appreciated what he was trying to do with this, it just wasn't for us.  I always find a bit of humor in most Miike films, no matter how sick.  This just felt more like a Kung Fu Hustle type of deal, which isn't a bad thing but isn't my bag.  The drama was also just a little overwrought in places.  I couldn't really deal with the bad dialogue either, I'm not sure if that is supposed to be an homage to Sergio Leone filsm or what, but it was really distracting.

It is incredibly slow paced and there is little to no character development. The stranger in the movie talks about a score he has to settle but nothing is really made clear on what the score is and why. I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino's films, but his acting is crap. Why on Earth he was even in this film is beyond me. It was just too cheesey. I was also hoping for a Japanese audio track because it awful having to hear heavy Japanese accents saying words like ""reckon"" and ""y'all"".

There was a bit of comic relief whenever the town sheriff was on screen, but his character was not enough to save this film.

3512975,4,B001CIOCJO,"I had read a review of this movie a month or so ago, and the premise had sounded interesting.  I thought at the time it might be worth checking out, but I forgot about it until I saw it at the rental store yesterday and picked it up.

A movie like this has a fan base built into it - there are the chop-socky elements, the Tarentino effect, and the stylized western film scenes akin to the Italian films of the 60's, plus loads of cultural references I'm sure I didn't even get.  If you dig one or more of those catagories, then I know you'll find something to like about this movie.

I enjoyed it myself - hence the 4 stars - but I would think, even with all the elements mentioned before, that this film will have limited appeal.  More importantly, though, is why some people will fall all over it.

Aside from the mixing of genres and the heavy use of homage, I thought the film was a lark, enjoyable but not terribly deep.  The emphasis on style over storytelling, and the use of the homage to further your understanding of the movie, will probably leave some people in the dark.  It's almost as if the stylized posturing was valued by the director as a 'shortcut' to character development.

Even though Sergio Leone took the story line of 'A few dollars more' from 'yojimbo' (which is referenced here as well), I thought that movie was entirely his own.  'Sukiyaki Western Django' may have a multi-layered multi-cultural sheen to it, but I never felt as though it completely divorced itself from the movies it borrowed from.

As a side note, my fiance just rolled her eyes as the credits rolled, so take warning all you spaghetti western, chop-socky, anime, tarentino fans - your significant other may head the other way when you slip this one in.",1227225600,2,1752,4.477987421383648

Essentially a Japanese samurai movie set in a western style Nevada desert town.  The production team and cast consisted of mostly Japanese talent (Quinten Tarrantino is the exception), but they are all speaking english (not dubbed).

The film is funny, full of blood, and full of over-the-top martial arts and Shakespearean tragedy.  Overall a fun romp through two genres mashed together.

Well, Tarantinos awful acting cameos are always expected and often times add to a movie in a wierd way much like from dusk till dawn or reservoir dogs, he's the puff daddy of movies. However, his cameo appearances were completely alien in this movie and completely unnessesary in a film sooooo boring and pretentious in it's sad attempts to imitate asian cinemetography noir. By merging heavy asian influences to the typical western movie left for intruiging possibilities but....

I had high hopes for this movie and the trailer did a great job selling this movie as the best sequences were shown in the trailer. First of all, I thought this movie would be in japanese but it was in English in fact. This is great but the english is BAD. The actors had very thick accents which made understanding the movie extremely difficult especially with such a convoluted story line such as this. I eventually had to add subtitles to understand the english they were trying speak!

Having done this, it did not help in the way of understanding the story. The story revolves around two clans, Red and White who fight for power under the war of the roses mentality. A mysterious stranger comes into town and has to chose a side based on who pays the most. The problem is that there is no war of the roses as the red clan is basically ruled and picked on by the much more powerfull white clan. The town sherrif who is crazy and has split personality tries to recruit him for the red clan. The story becomes more conveluted with the introduction of a beautiful white clan woman who has a past. Her husband who was a red clan member,  was killed by the red clan leader leaving their half red white son mute. She then let herself be violated by the white clan leader for revenge on the red clan. the son was taken care of is grandmother who turns out to be a fierce warrior later in the movie. Then some old shamen from the mountains is introduced later in the movie for the purposes of healing the hero. There are so many more unessesary characters introduced thorught the movie and each one has there own story which has nothing to do with main story. On and on and on.

There were about two decent action sequences and thats it! The rest is meaningless hard to understand dialogue. Instead of taking a cool idea added with great action sequences, the film try's to push an artsy back drop with western dialoge to put out a unique noir type movie. But it fails miserably. I had to force myself to finish the movie for this review. I felt it my duty to inform potential buyers. Thank god I rented this movie instead of buying it. If you are thinking of buying this movie without seeing it first... STOP! Rent it first before you buy, although I wouldn't even recommend renting it.

Now I'll tell you why I absolutely loved this movie.  For me it was a formula that was bound to be good: 3 parts Western, 2 parts Samurai, 1 part Quentin Terentino.  This isn't a movie that you watch for the wonderful story or technical achievement - for me this movie is to cinema what poetry is to literature. Miike wasn't interested in the rules or the details, just to get the feeling across, which I think he did flawlessly.

It's primarily an over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek parody of Spaghetti Westerns that had me rolling with laughter (quote: ""are you gonna strike at me with that blade... or whistle dixie?""). It is especially funny because it just sounds so ludicrous with the Japanese accents.  But it also has adrenaline-pumping action, and even slips into some very deep and heavy emotions - this movie really got under my skin!

After watching it several times, what has stuck out most vividly in my mind is how unique and refreshing this movie is.  Even though the basic plot of the movie has been done at least twice before (Yojimbo, Last Man Standing), I've never seen another movie that is anything like it - and I've seen A LOT of movies.

Miike does it again by surpassing the stunning stylizations of ''Izo'' to come up with a wonderful take on the flexibility of the western genre. Just as the spaghetti western twisted the stylistic forms of traditional Hollywood oaters, Miike bends both into a hyperrealistic dimesion where gunfighters/samurai/yakuza (each with their own multi-levelled gestalts) can do moral combat. No wonder Tarentino loves this guy.

Think of the plot of Corbucchi's ''Django'' (as boroque a spaghetti western as you will find) filter it through Leone, toss in Kurosawa's Yojimbo, and stir liberally while adding dashes of Hideo Gosha and Nick Ray's ''Johnny Guitar.'' Get the picture? Maybe you just have to see it. Don't take my word for it, but this is a beautiful homage  by one of the world cinema's most brilliant auteurs.

3513003,4,B001CIOCJO,"SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO (2007) is Takashi Miike's spin on the Asian Western. While it may not be a wholly original idea, video games have experimented on this mixing of genres such as ""Western Samurai"", Eiichi Kudo's Fort of Death (1969) and the nearest attempt at an Asian western is Hong Kong's ""Peace Hotel""; Miike's version is worth the buzz and the hype. The film exudes coolness and is surprisingly entertaining, it is a fitting tribute to Spaghetti westerns (""Sukiyaki"" instead of ""spaghetti"") and chambara (samurai) period films. Also, a certain American director who loves Asian films makes an appearance as a cowboy who eats a pot of sukiyaki. That's right, Tarantino makes an appearance as a man named Pringo (a play on Pierrot and Ringo), this man certainly knows Miike's work and has repeatedly expressed that he is a fan of the acclaimed Japanese director.

Two opposing clans, the Genji and Heiki clans have taken control of a town called Nevada. Nope, this is a Japanese Nevada where the inhabitants' native tongue is English, they`re all Japanese folks with hybrid western-Asian outfits and Japanese monikers. A lone drifter (Hideyaki Ito), who is also very good with a gun, enters the town and is forced to pick a side. The stranger is so skilled that his joining an opposite clan would most likely tip the scales. The two rival gangs (eh, clans) are fighting over a legendary hidden chest of treasure and they have driven out almost all inhabitants except for a woman named Ruriko and the eccentric town sheriff.

Sniff some Kurosawa, inhale some Gosha with a whiff of Okamoto and take 2 tablespoons of Sergio Leone three times a day; and what you have a mixed genre-busting film which blends the grittiness and coolness of spaghetti westerns with the moodiness and atmosphere of chambara/jidai geki films that is the cure for boredom. The film is a push to remind the Italians of the eternal debt they owe to Japanese Samurai films. Put a dash of a Katana sword, a Gatling gun, a lot of dynamite, gunfights and characters that are outrageously cool and you have the perfect recipe for the epitome of Asian cult films with (maybe) mass-mainstream appeal. The films' main premise itself is YOJIMBO-like or ""Fistful of Dollars"" if you prefer.

The set designs are also quite curious and very creative. The architecture of the buildings are definitely hybrids of Japanese feudal design with the usual western style. Shakespeare's War of Flowers is taken as a code of Bushido (?). The costumes are anime-inspired in their own way with a strong touch of western cinema except for the main character. Legends and mysticism also play a small part in this genre-busting extravaganza. The film definitely crosses all boundaries and the film never limits itself. The action has a touch of hard-boiled cool with the usual bullet ballet and the film's proceedings have the Tarantino-like sly and twisted humor.

Hideyaki Ito (Uzimaru 2) plays the stranger and the man definitely can pull off the essentials of a mysterious drifter. Kaori Moimoi (Love and Honor) plays a mysterious woman named Ruriko who is the mother of the deceased Akira who was also the husband of sexy Shizuka, played by Yoshino Kimura. This actress exudes raw sex appeal and has the characteristics of an ice-cold femme fatale. The camera work is excellent, Miike assisted by cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita is very impressive. The movements are fluid, facial expressions have a solidarity and the music itself calls a lot of attention.

It is a little weird that Miike would shoot this film with the performers speaking English since I've read that the man grew up watching dubbed Italian films, and disliked it. The delivery in dialogue is somewhat wanting and Miike is a master of movement as displayed in ""Izo"" and ""Dead or Alive"". I wanted to watch the film with subtitles and I found myself rewinding a few times to hear the dialogue again just so I won't miss any of the wonderful visuals. Most of the cast mumble almost phonetically and it was obvious that only Yoshino Kimura is the only one really skilled with the English language. The dialogue may hamper the film a little but believe me, not by much.

The plot itself may be a little too simple and offers not too much for the imagination. Much of the character development occurs in the form of storytelling and flashbacks. The film does exercise more on style over substance but the film is a successful exercise in freedom and versatility. The stunning visuals and camera work surpasses its spirit that some viewers may find the film a bit passive and is too commercially superficial. However, the nice and VERY cool touches in the screenplay hides its shortcomings. The legend of ""Bloody Benten"" (a woman who can give Lady Snowblood a run for her money), the mystery of Pringo, the duel between a six-shooter and a katana sword, the tale of a young boy and the unknown drifter adds a lot of quality to the film with pure popcorn entertainment. Fans of Asian cinema and Western movies will be busy enjoying the sequences and undoubtedly look for references from other cult films. If you've seen the other genre-breaking film ""Versus"", you may have an idea of what you're in for. The film has more style than substance, but it is an excellent display of Takashi Miike's more mainstream goals. The film has the crowd-pleasing appeal but will undeniably develop a cult following.

""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is a successful blend and fusion of genres that delivers pure enjoyable entertainment, despite the bad English delivery. Takashi Miike has pulled it off again...and forgiven for the ""Great Yokai War"". (Zebraman anyone?)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4+ stars]

Note: The film is known is also known as ""My Life as McMug"" in Malaysia. Make certain you see the film with English Subs because while the dialogue is in English, it's a bit hard to make it out. I believe it may have been done intentionally.
The U.S. release will feature multiple covers (including steel/tin book covers, I double-dipped on the Bloody Benten cover) and will carry terrific English subtitles.
However, the GENEON region-2 Dvd I have from Japan clocks in at 120 minutes, the U.S. release has been edited to 98 minutes. While the U.S. release is a little more faster-paced, the uncut edition does have more Character development, Extended action sequences and has a better fleshed-out story.",1226016000,7,6408,4.909510618651893

He's conquered the heights of truly disturbing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/horror/dp/B000GI3RHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">horror</a>, redefined&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/disgusting/dp/B00006FDBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">disgusting</a>, shown us horrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/violence/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">violence</a>, that love is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/torture/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">torture</a>, and spoofed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/superhero/dp/B000EI4N6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">superhero</a>&nbsp;genre as well while making as many as nine films in a single year.  No joke.  So having crossed every line possible, what's left?  Why not bring a katana to a gunfight and see what happens?  ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is to the western film genre what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00068ULLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;was to the martial-arts genre: a love letter in cinematic form from across the Pacific Ocean.  And sure enough, Miike-sensei brought Quentin Tarantino along for the ride.  Tighten your bootstraps, this one's a doozy.

I am not a fan of western films, but Asian cult cinema: hell yes.  I would qualify this film as an absolute must-see for either/or and I imagine there is no shortage of western references and homages that flew over my head due to my inexperience with the genre.  The title is an amusing Japanese play on the ""spaghetti western"" nickname coupled with the name of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/classic-example/dp/B000PC6Z48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">classic example</a>&nbsp;of the genre itself.  Why this is relevant doesn't reveal itself until the last scene so I won't spoil it.  The movie is almost schizophrenic (as is it's town sheriff) in it's mish-mash of styles.  Some scenes overflow with bright colors and classic Japanese imagery, other times the shots are yellowish with muted colors like a classic western and feature those sorts of settings.  One character has a holstered gun on one hip and a sheathed katana on the other.  One gang dresses in bright red -including some dyed emo-style hair- and the other in pure white.  All of the weapons are old-school, but there are modern bits like facial piercings as well.  At one point, Tarantino hints at the origin of his character's son's name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>) by declaring himself ""an anime otaku at heart"" to which the other character responds with a baffled ""what!?"".  Absolutely brilliant and uncalled for.  Exactly the kind of oddball moment one never expects, but Miike delivers anyway.  The story is a convoluted one that demands you pay attention to it, but I had to rewatch several stretches because I was utterly distracted by the bizarre nature of the film itself.  For example, the opening scene features Tarantino in front of an obviously painted background.  Blood even splatters onto it when he shoots a guy.  There is also a short-but-sweet animated flourish during one of his stories about a female gunfighter (Bloody Benton).  How can you be expected to pay attention to the dialogue when this movie is continually throwing you these kinds of visual curve-balls?  Not so much a complaint as an observation.

""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is an almost entirely English (Engrish?) language film.  While I do very much respect Miike's artistic decision to film the movie in the native language of the stories that inspired it, it does end up detracting from the quality.  It is painfully obvious at times that the actors are unaware of just what they are saying as they attempt to act while pronouncing every word phonetically.  This is not true for all of the actors, but it happens often enough to be a distraction.  The big showdown is explosive enough to make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Woo/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Woo</a>&nbsp;envious.  There is some very entertaining action, a recurring bit where a gunshot produces an explosion of feathers from off camera -which may or may not be an amusing homage to Woo himself-, some sex appeal (the image of Bloody Benton licking her sizzling gun barrel is staying with me for a while), some pretty dark humor, an entrancing and sensual dance sequence, and plenty more for film fanatics to sink their teeth into here.  You will not be disappointed.

Like the young boy in this story born of the union between red and white gang members and the beautiful two-toned roses his family tends to, this movie is neither here nor there. It is East-meets-West to the hilt.  A perfect hybrid of offbeat Asian cinema and the traditional western.  It is utterly entertaining to fans of either and should be considered mandatory viewing.  Check out ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" if the premise appeals to you in any way and a good time will be had by all.  Now off into the sunset I ride.",1225584000,25,5664,6.185185185185185

Just seen that they're selling this one on a special edition Steelbook. It looks so cool! The kind of thing you want added to any DVD collection. If you're gonna buy this film make sure you look out for it on one of the 3 steelbooks.

Its the most fun Western that you'll EVER see!! I can't wait to see what Miike does next!!",1225324800,,466,3.9574468085106385

The first question I answered by shutting it off, it was almost unbearable and the second? I read a couple of reviews saying how great it was! Now I like Spaghetti Westerns, I collect them, so I found it mentioned in some top 40 or so called best Spaghetti Westerns. It is not, I repeat, not even worth an honorable mention. It is juvenile Japanese kung-fu and gun violence, hard to understand dialog, REALLY silly costumes and just out right bad acting, with nothing original or entertaining. Also, Quentin Tarantino should be ashamed of his appearance in the opening scene. Really a STUPID movie, don't buy it, find someone who already made the mistake and borrow it if you must see for yourself.",1507680000,,789,4.563380281690141
8287714,5,B001CIOCJO,"This is one of my favorite movies of late. I think the movie get's lost on a lot of people who don't understand what it is. Basically it's an action comedy, The fact that the whole cast is speaking english, when the only person who speaks english as a first language is tarantino is all part of the joke.

It's not meant to be realistic and its not serious. But it is funny and action packed. Also one of the most original, if not the most original, takes on the clint eastwood classic to date.

If you like Tarantino movies, give this a shot. If you can't understand them speaking english, don't whine about it. Turn on the subtitles you plebs.",1505952000,,645,4.322314049586777
