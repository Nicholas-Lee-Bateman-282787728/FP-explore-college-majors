8236614,5,B000HEV7C4,"One of my favorite films made about WWII is ""The Fighting Lady"".  Directed by William Wyler, the man who produced ""Ben Hur"" and other thrilling films, ""Fighting Lady"" follows the second USS Yorktown on combat patrol against the Japanese.  It's one of the most impressive films about carrier combat that you can see, and inspired George Lucas in his battle sequences in ""Star Wars"" a fact that won't be lost on you when you watch it!  Also on this DVD are several other credible films showing the aircraft carrier war.  There's an interesting movie about the career of the USS Hornet, which launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo, and then was lost after the Battle of Midway.  A terrific DVD with much more than an hour of entertainment!",1161475200,,740,4.75
