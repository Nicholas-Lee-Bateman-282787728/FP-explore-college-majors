I stumbled upon this DVD and bought it after reading the reviews here. This is very, very good. I have been watching it four nights in a row. Not because it is difficult to understand but because it contains so much good stuff - explained in the clearest way.",1452038400,2,394,4.197368421052632
8019154,4,B0001ZX02O,"Sokolow is a competent teacher, and proves it with this book/DVD.  Most people can use this to add to their music theory knowledge.",1407456000,,131,4.695652173913044

That is the one line summary for people in a hurry and just want the final word on the session.

If you are looking at this it is most likely you are a player and also pretty likely you want too or wish you could learn more about Chord Progressions ""which Chord will fit here and What's the theory behind making those changes?"" and it's also pretty likely you are wondering, ""Is this another one of those junk deals were they make you all kinds of promises and the only thing that you get is separated from your money"" No, this is one of those that you get way, way more for your money. You'll want to hang onto this DVD and watch it often not because it is so complex, it isn't, You'll want to hang onto this DVD because it is so jam packed full of excellent, usable information.

I had people ""Teach"" me songs for years; however when I asked, How do you do that? Meaning ""What is the theory of chord changes and progressions? Basically you would receive a mumbled answer.

I learned more education and received more practical application theory and method from Fred Sokolow in this DVD than what I received from taking years of formal lessons with very lettered people.

I learned not only why many things happen I also learned how to apply it to my playing. Not only do you learn the reason most songs use certain chords but you learn what they are, how to switch keys and maintain the chord patterns faster than you can think of the name of the key or chord you went to. I reviewed the DVD w/o my guitar and I now feel I can tell you what chords are being played in a song on the radio and that I also could probably have a good track record to tell you what cords are going to follow after hearing only a little bit of a song.

It is nice to ""Get way more than you paid for"" and that's what you get with this Fred Sokolow session, and you get it from a warm hearted, entertaining person. Nice to get more than you expected.
Enjoy, and purchase this with confidence that you will understand Chord Progressions very well when you finish studying this learning session.

8019156,5,B0001ZX02O,"In his  calm and natural style, Fred explains song organization with a mix of licks, chords, songs and theory. You will learn a lot about how to listen for chord progressions by  watching and playing along with very accessible instruction for guitarists of all levels.",1278806400,6,268,4.933333333333334
8019157,5,B0001ZX02O,"Why does music work the way it does, what comes next in a progression?  Fred explains in clear brilliantly simple style the theory behind the movement of music, the pattern that remains the same, even though the key can change, the structure that makes the song. This is a rosetta stone for musical understanding and Fred is the man who helps you understand it without obfuscation and ego, but with the clarity of a teacher who really knows music inside out. He's a brilliant teacher and a really good player. Buy this dvd, buy all his dvd's they're the best way to learn guitar that I've found. Fred is great!",1246579200,16,610,4.545454545454546
8019158,5,B0001ZX02O,"This is a very good video. It goes beyond what the title implies.

He covers chord progressions, song structure, and the circle of fifths and how they relate to the guitar. Also covered is chords and diatonic melody structures. He relates it all to to position in the scale so you can transpose to any key.

It would be hard to say too many good things about this video. It demystifies how you actually use the dreaded music theory in a practical way.",1214092800,16,451,4.421686746987952
