Hal Sharp is of course a living legend in the judo world, especially among us classicists.  These videos (with all six being autonomous and coming equipped with the same rather poignant introduction by Sharp) are historical gems: they contain fabulous material dating to the 1950s, largely centered at the Kodokan.  There is very rare footage here, of remarkable quality.  For example there is an ancient kata featuring none other than Kano himself with Mifune as his uke (actually, I think that's in the first set).  There is footage of a clinic by Mifune, and randori footage of Kotani, Nagaoka, and many, many others.  There's also some fantastic stuff on Osawa.  What more can one say: this is a unique and invaluable contribution to judo by a great judoka and sensei.",1442880000,,865,4.836734693877551
