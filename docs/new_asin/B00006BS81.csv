Side Note: Though there appear to be two different versions of this movie, both are exactly the same thing. The different cover and names lead you to believe they are different.",1437436800,,215,5.142857142857143
7966863,4,B00006BS81,"Warning: this movie is not for the sensitive or genteel viewer. It is filled with lewd and offensive humor, crude sexual imagery and references, a fixation on male genitilia and gay sex, overuse of the f-word, plus some gore and violence thrown in for good measure. In short, it's awesome.

How many twists to the original Frankenstein's monster story have we seen? No matter how many Frankenstein movies you've seen, I bet you've never seen any quite like this one. The plot is simple: a down-on-his-luck music agent (a great performance by Barry Feterman) gets his mad-scientist nephew, Frankie Stein (get it?) to create the ultimate rock god- using the body parts of dead musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Elvis. Of course, things don't go as planned, and the monster winds up with a- certain body part- from Liberace. The monster is eventually groomed into performing (Graig Guggenheim does a great job as the monster) but seems to have some ""unnatural urges"", as he calls them. As his creators discover the cause of these urges and decide what to do about it, in true manmade monster style, he starts to kill people. He then suffers an existential crisis about who he is and what he's done, and decides to put an end to himself. The last scene, in which this occurs, is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in a movie.

The DVD features a director's commentary that's as amusing as the film, plus some trailers. The acting is great, the script and dialogue are hilarious, and the end result is a highly entertaining movie that's more comedy than horror, with a little bit of porn. If you like raunchy B movies, you can't miss this one.",1208563200,,1648,4.65979381443299
7966864,4,B00006BS81,"Every musician has dreamed of their dream band, but this movie takes it one step further, a fat, cigar smoking record exec wants the next great entertainer. So what to do? Dig up parts of dead musicians and put them together! With Jimi Hendrix's hands and Jim Morrison's penis how can you go wrong? Easily, accidently use Liberace's penis for your creation!
The funniest part is when 'Elvis' is having sex with a groupie. He actually puts a gay porn magazine on her back while doing her. This is the kind of humor we see here folks. I won't even get into the 'Death by hanging yourself with your own penis' climax.
PS -- Oh yeah how could I forget? The penis talks!!!!",1080172800,3,668,4.439024390243903
7966865,1,B00006BS81,"Standard Shock-o-rama cinema BOREfest. The term cruel and unusual punishment do not even begin to describe the experience of having to sit through this ""movie"".
This movie is sooo unbelievably boring, that about half way through the film i just couldn't take it anymore and went to go wash dishes.. after that i just got back in time for the last 5 mnts. That was enough to make me want to burn the dvd (...). This movie is utterly stupid and not funny at all, although it seems like they makers were really trying desperately to be funny. Seriously, A Rose for Emily was a barrel of laughs compared to this crummy afterbirth excuse for a movie. I cant even believe people actually think this is funny. not funny, just painfully stupid.
shock-o-rama makes the worst movies, and r-n-r f proves it...",1073088000,3,798,4.626760563380282
7966866,1,B00006BS81,"Rock & Roll Frankenstein sounds like it should be hilarious; once I read the plot summary, I just had to see the film.  It's clearly a bad movie from the very start, yet it does have some funny moments - at first.  The basic plot owes as much to Reanimator as it does to Frankenstein, as you have an outcast medical-type guy who has discovered a way to reanimate body parts and is anxious to see if he can give life to a human being composed of parts from different people.  What makes this film so different is the fact that our medical wonderboy has an uncle in the music promotion business who really, really wants to create a new superstar.  His master plan is to steal the best body parts from the greatest musicians of all time and reassemble them in one body.  Thus, the monster has the head of Elvis, the hands of Jimi Hendrix, and other parts from legends such as Buddy Holly and Sid Vicious.  The greedy uncle wants his star to be a big hit with the ladies, as well, so the final body part (and I think you can figure out what I'm referring to here) is to come from Jim Morrison; accidentally and most unfortunately, though, the final body part ends up coming from Liberace.  This is where I began to sense really big trouble.  When Liberace's special little body part started talking to the monster, Rock & Roll Frankenstein pretty much flat-lined as far as I was concerned, quickly turning into one long, extended dirty joke.  There are a few killings thrown in along the way, but these are actually handled so distastefully as to be remarkably not funny.  Once the plot went south, there was no hope of salvaging much of anything from the movie as a whole.  The cast members, for their part, didn't help the cause.  The uncle's role calls for nothing but foul language delivered very loudly, the monster is just a caricature of Elvis (one who looks nothing like him despite supposedly having his head), and the young medical genius (with a history of necrophilia) seemingly refuses to even try any degree of acting whatsoever.  If you can listen to a dirty joke told over and over for hours on end, you might enjoy Rock & Roll Frankenstein.  As for me, I find it unfortunate that a somewhat promising premise was basically abandoned halfway through the film, decry the fact that one highly controversial scene was included for no good reason whatsoever, and admit I found nothing of value and far too little humor in this movie to justify its strange existence.",1053475200,4,2474,4.5303370786516854
7966867,4,B00006BS81,"I rented this flick on a friend's reccommendation, not expecting much. Boy was I surprised! I laughed my... off and then went out and added it to my collection. You know the story already, about the creation of a rock star from dead musicians parts, from the synopsis. This movie holds nothing sacred and you absolutely MUST get the unrated version. The R version is total... and I accidentally ordered it from here. (Can't send it back now.) Make sure you get the UNRATED version.",1040860800,3,481,4.670588235294118

7966869,5,B00006BS81,"This is the most hilarious movie I have seen in years. A record producer tries to build the perfect rock star by assembling the body parts of Elvis Presley,Buddy Holly,Jimi Hendrix and others. The plan goes awry when the pothead graverobbing roadies steal the wrong penis and the monster is equipped with Liberaces member instead of Jim Morrisons. The rock and roll Frankenstein tries to fight his homosexual urges which eventually lead to murder. This movie is full of extremely crude jokes and I would not recommend it to anyone who doesnt have a warped sense of humor. An instant classic.",1034467200,6,591,4.861386138613861
