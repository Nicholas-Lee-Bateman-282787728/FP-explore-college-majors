5409107,5,B00ADO9C9I,This is a wonderful introduction to Yoga!  Barbara Benagh keeps it easy to follow yet thorough. I would highly recommend this DVD for beginners or a person who isn't as young in body as they used to be!:),1372809600,120,204,4.368421052631579
5409108,3,B00ADO9C9I,not what I expected . Routines are a little to slow for me. my fault it does say yoga over 50 ......,1372723200,6,100,3.590909090909091
5409109,5,B00ADO9C9I,I am fairly new to yoga and I am 62... I love the idea of doing yoga at my own pace and in my own home.  I love Barbara Benagh's approach and style!  excellent... I loved it so much I bought DVD for my sisters.,1371945600,252,210,3.6444444444444444
5409110,4,B00ADO9C9I,Goes at a pace that someone over 50 can keep up with.  She includes ways to adjust the positions if you can't do them with comfort.  Enough of a variety to keep  you from getting bored.  I find the routines to be relaxing and helpful with improving flexibility.,1369440000,339,261,4.375
5409111,5,B00ADO9C9I,"I have found this to be the most informative dvd I have ever seen. Barbara Benagh takes her time to explain each session, but not in a slow boring way. I can't wait to get more involved with the excercises,",1364169600,172,206,4.175

5409114,5,B00ADO9C9I,This yoga tape is great for someone over 50 or new to yoga.  Instructor talks slowly and explains the position for those who are flexible and how to do it if you are not.  Really recommend this for a true beginner.  Great instructions and 8 lessons,1519862400,,248,4.3478260869565215

She gives beneficial introductory information before each of the routines, and the DVD introduction is helpful in knowing how to use the eight different routines. This is a DVD I will be using often. The instructions, are not inserted in such a way so as to interfere with being able to get right into the yoga routines.

I have to say, as someone who has been sedentary...and 60+...although the video has ""something for everyone"" , it was just a little out of my league for my present condition (or lack thereof). That being said, it is my goal to get to the point that I can do the chair and arthritis routines. I found another DVD to help get me there. Not Barbara's, but it's a stepping stone to help develop a little more flexibility. I'm happy I purchased the product. It gives me a goal to reach.

5409346,5,B00ADO9C9I,I have used only the chair exercise routines so far as I am limited in my mobility. I loved this DVD.,1438473600,,101,3.857142857142857
5409347,5,B00ADO9C9I,"My husband is 72 and I am 55.  He has rheumatoid arthritis but works a lot around the house and yard.  I try and stay active.  A physical therapist suggested I try yoga after PT for a shoulder injury.  We got lucky with this video.  It is excellent!  I wanted something that would challenge us, stretch and tone our muscles, but wouldn't be too much for absolute beginners.  The instructor, Barbara, has a pleasant voice, and explains things carefully and well.  The movements are easy to follow although not all easy to do.  There are a variety of different workouts.  So far we are going through the list choosing the routine and time depending upon our mood.  We have done a workout a day from this video for the past few weeks.  Already my husband has said he is finding it easier to climb stairs.  We are both feeling stronger and more toned.  There is enough variety in this one video to keep us from getting bored. Also the range of abilities in each routine will keep us challenged from the rank beginners that we are to the yoga king and queen we hope to become! =))  Hopefully someday we will be so accomplished that we will need something more advanced.  For the time being...I feel so lucky that we started with this video.  It was the perfect beginning video to challenge us and explain things clearly.",1438300800,34,1315,4.481012658227848
5409348,4,B00ADO9C9I,"At the current age of 47, I am just short of the ""over 50"" target audience for this video.  However, a friend of mine lent me this DVD to try, as I own and enjoy several of instructor Barbara Benagh's other videos.  Her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Stress-Relief/dp/B000ICLRKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Stress Relief</a>&nbsp;is one of my all-time favorite yoga DVDs, as it provides a wonderful variety of practices, but I also really like her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AM-PM-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B000UUX2P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AM/PM Yoga for Beginners</a>, and I have found her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Back-Care/dp/B00ADO9CHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Back Care</a>&nbsp;to be useful as well.

Like Benagh's prior releases, Yoga Over 50 offers multiple practices.  The DVD case says that these routines vary from 20-60 minutes, but to my disappointment, the shortest was actually 25 minutes--too long for a quick practice--and the longest is 50 minutes, so not a full hour, although Benagh provides tips on combining the routines.

Here is the Main Menu along with times for each practice:

How to Use this DVD
Interview with the Instructor
Sun Salutation (25 minutes)
General Practice (45 minutes)
Seated Poses (50 minutes)
Flexibility & Strength (40 minutes)
Yoga on a Chair (50 minutes)
Guided Relaxation (25 minutes)
Osteoarthritis (35 minutes)
Osteoporosis (40 minutes)
Credits

Selecting some (but not all) of the routines brings up a submenu with an option for a brief introduction by Benagh specifically about that practice.  I found her discussions somewhat confusing.  For example, in her intro to the ""Flexibility & Strength"" practice, she talks about this being a 2-part routine and how half of it can be combined with one of the other practices.  However, there is no natural break at the halfway part through this practice; there are a few internal chapter breaks, but they do not seem to be at stopping points consistent with Benagh's explanation.

I also had some issues with how the practices were described.  The ""Seated"" practice began lying on the floor, and it wound up consisting of approximately half lying postures, half seated poses.  ""Yoga on a Chair"" would have been more appropriately named ""Yoga WITH a Chair.""  Benagh did start seated on the chair, but she also performed approximately 10 minutes of the practice standing behind or beside the chair, using the chair as an accessory.

I think Benagh is an excellent instructor, and I do think that there are worthwhile aspects of his DVD--so long as one knows what to expect.  It would probably be best suited to older adults who have had some experience with yoga and would like to continue practicing regardless of age or injury.",1437523200,18,2903,5.7952941176470585

One thing that is inconsequential to the quality of the exercise, but just annoys me, is the ""interview"" part.

Well, THIS yoga DVD is absolutely, 100% what I needed.  I LOVE this instructor...she's just right for me right now and have recommended it to several of my friends.

5409522,5,B00ADO9C9I,"I have used this now since last September and it has been a great help to me.  I feel like I have more energy and less aches and pains.

The teacher is really good in explaining the movements and it is easy to follow and I like the subtitles.  I have allergies/seasonal asthma  (I found a great article she wrote for the Yoga Journal about asthma) and when I am really congested my ears get a bit clogged, fortunately my hearing is still pretty much fine.",1397433600,,455,4.255813953488372
5409523,3,B00ADO9C9I,"This is a nicely produced DVD, filmed in a nice setting, and the teacher is good.  But I was disappointed in several ways.  First, with 8 routines I was expecting more variety.  I did 6 of the 8 and found that there is a lot of overlap between them.  For example in the 45 minute ""general practice"" there are 10 poses.  In the 50 minute ""seated practice"" there are 12 poses, but 7 of these are exactly the same as in the ""general practice"".  I found this redundancy a bit boring.  More important than that though is the fact that there are SO many muscles and joints in the human body that need to be worked and stretched to keep the entire body strong and healthy.  The limited number of poses included on the DVD simply do not work the entire body and put all the joints through their full range of motion, and does not take advantage of all that yoga has to offer.

In the introduction to the Osteoarthritis section, she says that the practice will be targeting flexibility and balance.  Yet there wasn't one single balance pose in this section.  I only recall there being one balance pose on the whole DVD, and very little strength work for the feet and ankles.  For a DVD that targets the over 50 age group I felt this was a serious omission.  Falls are one of the primary reasons seniors lose their confidence & independence, and end up in hospitals.  The only way to maintain good balance is to work at it, and this DVD missed a good opportunity to help people.

I also think some of the poses will be difficult for a lot of people over 50.  For example in the osteoarthritis section she includes the leg position of the cow-face pose, which is done sitting on the ground, legs crossed, feet alongside the hips and the knees stacked on top of each other.  Many people do not have the skeletal structure to be able to do this, regardless of age or whether or not they have arthritis (everyone's skeleton is unique).  Hips are complex structures that can and should be moved in a wide variety of ways, and there are dozens of easy yoga poses to do this.  I was disappointed that of the two hip openers included in this section, one is inaccessible to most older people.

On the plus side, her voice is pleasant, the pace is relaxing, and her instructions are good. Her guided relaxation is wonderful.  But I have been practicing yoga for over 35 years, work with middle age and senior populations, and have a strong background in anatomy, which probably makes me look at these things more critically.",1397433600,47,2505,4.437636761487965

I normally grit my teeth and push myself to do yoga because I feer I'll hurt myself again.  So I purchased this DVD as well as yoga for back care.  Oddly enough, the back care one is harder to do than this DVD for over 50 yo.  I still need to avoid certain stretches but overall I feel much better after doing one routine every other day. I find I have a few sore muscles which means I'm getting stronger and I notice that I walk straighter and just feel more flexible.  So even if you are not over 50 this DVD can be a good starting place for gently improving strength and flexibility.
