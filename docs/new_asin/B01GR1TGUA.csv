Good selection of movies.
The artwork on the DVD cases and discs themselves is nice.
Affordable price.

Now for the con that ruins the whole thing: The packaging. The cases for the discs are some of the worst I've seen. The artwork was sloppily placed into the sleeve, the latches that hold the case shut broke off on two of the cases, and none of the discs were properly attached. They were all loose, which caused the discs to get light scratches. Luckily, I had some spare cases at my house. Unfortunately, those scratches cause skips and distortion to scenes of the films, which make them unwatchable. I have two other DVDs by Alpha Video (Hunchback of Notre Dame and Phantom of the Opera), which had good packaging.
I really wanted to like this set, but there's no way I'll let it pass. Stick to the Kino DVDs.",1532563200,,832,4.509933774834437
