8281278,4,B001B1DISI,"The doc has a long introduction.  I guess Nat'l Geo. assumed viewers would be bored, but I found the topic interesting.  I was very worried that they were just going to talk about the biology of skin and avoid the politics.  Luckily, they addressed that too.  Usually, I hate docs that are survey courses and just brush the surface.  Even though this work doesn't go into depth on things, it covers so much that I left quite satisfied.
It starts with that artist that photographs masses of people nude.  You may want to see this doc alongside ""Naked States.""  Much of the nudity in this work is blurred, but there are some glimpses of ""naughty bits.""  The work doesn't avoid connecting skin with sexual issues as well.
Off the top of my head, I noticed they didn't mention body piercing.  One of the critiques of early sexologists is that they described when sex doesn't work, rather than when it does.  They addressed the margins, rather than the center.  This work does focus on healthy skin.  And that's fine.  However, diseases weren't addressed.  There is nothing here about leprosy, Kaposi's sarcoma, or even zits.
I guess some may feel this should have been done by the Discovery Channel, rather than Nat'l Geo., but I think NG did an admirable job here.",1296345600,,1261,4.672727272727273
