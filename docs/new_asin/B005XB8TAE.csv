8488523,5,B005XB8TAE,"Ok. Slice of life anime are pretty common(Second of course to the major genres like shounen). But a well done slice of life can be quite difficult to find. Not to mention I'm usually all for a psychological or shounen anime. Sure it may only be 13 eps bare bones release, but if you prefer sub anime and aren't burning for special features then this will a delight to watch. An excellent slice of life comedy.",1379289600,,409,4.394736842105263
8488524,5,B005XB8TAE,"This short (12 episodes) anime series centers on Hotori Arashiyama and her part-time job at a ""maid"" cafe. This is NOTHING like Kaichou-wa Maid-sama. Hotori is a bit of a scatterbrained detective-wannabe who gets into lots trouble.
The situations are weird as hell and there are plenty of oddball characters to make this train-wreck anime worth watching.
Anime fans will be interested to know that the opening theme is sung by anime legend Maaya Sakamoto and the closing theme is probably the weirdest theme song EVER; something worthy of a Japanese version of the Doctor Demento Show.",1339804800,3,585,5.041237113402062
8488525,4,B005XB8TAE,"This show is about a goofy girl who works at a maid cafe in her spare time.  The animation issn't the best, the depth of plot is nil and there really isn't that much variance in mood thoughout the entire series.  That being said, it is funny.  The characters are good enough to hold up the show and give you a few laughs.  I'd recommend this show to fans of slice of life, comedy, and school-centric anime.",1338940800,,406,4.233766233766234
8488526,5,B005XB8TAE,"It's rare to see anime like this one.

I've seen a lot of crap being produced lately by what appear to be japanese high school graduates who lack both depth and storytelling skills and thus can only come up with repetitive, contrived, cliched high school romantic comedies that are neither romantic or funny. i was getting jaded by this genre and setting.

But every now and then you encounter hidden gems that just sparkle with freshness and substance, this show is one of them. Here, jokes are actually clever and funny and characters actually behave like normal people with normal hair colors and hair styles who converse with meaningful dialogues that give insight into their personalities.

The enjoyable cast and their antics kept me interested throughout the 12 episodes of this slice-of-life. I especially enjoyed Hotori, the leading female, for her unique way of thinking and perceptive nature that allows her to notice things others, including the viewers, don't.

It's refreshing to see a show that doesn't tease the audience with half baked fan service or insult our intelligence with archetypal characters who spew out immature dialogues in disgustingly high pitched phony anime voices.

Don't miss this gem.",1332633600,2,1221,5.146464646464646
8488527,5,B005XB8TAE,"I did not know what to expect from this anime and my first reaction to the first episode was ""what the heck is this?"" Without spoiling anything, this anime approaches Excel Saga with its zanniness, and like Excel Saga, it included tiny explanations that zoom into the screen to explain some of the more obscure cultural references. Which brings up one of my two complaints with this anime. The notes go by so fast you need to freeze frame the anime to read them.

By the second episode of the anime, I was hooked. At times the series veers off the typical ""slice of life"" format to present you with odd stories, like UFOs and the like, but it always jumps back on the rails, unlike other anime shows which often leave the core concept behind and never look back. I found myself caring for the girls, and laughed so loud that I scared the cats out of the room on several occasions. The last episode was a real tearjerker - the last anime that made me cry was Clannad - but this one isn't so depressing. It ends on an upbeat note, though the ending is rather abrupt.

The extras on the disk are rather spartan, which was my second complaint. There was a hilarious insert song on episode eight and the animation matches the music so closely that it is obvious that the art was animated to the music. The whole concept of the song was hilarious. But the insert song was not included as an extra. I hope that if this anime is reissued in the future that the full version of the insert song is included as an extra.",1328227200,11,1509,4.328621908127208
8488528,5,B005XB8TAE,"This show is quite entertaining with a cast of great quirky characters. Essentially, it revolves around a maid cafe where the boss and employees barely even put in the minimum effort. However, the stories do move beyond the cafe. The characters feel ""real"" as opposed to what you would get in a simple gag anime.
The opening song and animation is also one of the more memorable ones you're likely to see.",1327017600,7,404,4.625
8488529,5,B005XB8TAE,"I watched this show fan subbed and absolutely loved it. I'm not a big ""maid"" fan, but this show is so much MORE than a ""maid"" anime. If you love things like Azumanga Daioh, K-On or other quirky slice of life shows, you will love this.",1324944000,9,234,4.108695652173913
