I would go scour the web for more affordable options if you want to own the DVDs of this recent drama starring the very attractive Oguri Shun. :D Yeah, that's why I started watching it. He's hot. You can also watch this streaming online for free, but the quality is subpar often on free sites that have fan subbing. Hey, beggars cannot be choosers, right?

If this were more affordable, I'd say get it. Worth it. It's the story of a rich genius tech ""start-up"" milieu guy who ends up falling from his proud high place (hubris is his downfall, insensitivity to his coworkers and partner, etc). He's betrayed, ends up at rock bottom, but through all this he learns to appreciate the value of the girl who loves him and sticks by him, helping him to build and rebuild.

I enjoyed the happy ending, too. Lots of learning and forgiving, which is a nice thing. I would have loved MORE romance, but what's there is charming. The female protagonist is endearing, sweet, and very beautiful (though she's a weird fashionista).

Good show. Worth catching, especially for Shun-kun fans. :D",1360108800,,1101,4.635897435897436
