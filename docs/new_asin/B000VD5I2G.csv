8218164,4,B000VD5I2G,Great review for EMS providers!,1443916800,,31,5.4
8218165,4,B000VD5I2G,I would have preferred more information on the musculoskeletal system.  This video appeared to be geared more toward a professional and less geared for the novice.,1354752000,,163,5.269230769230769
8218166,3,B000VD5I2G,"Good for educational purposes, quite dry in content. It is not really one I would want to watch often or that is inspiring. It is always good to understand the human structure, especially if you are in the nursing field.",1289433600,,220,4.525
8218167,4,B000VD5I2G,DVD could have been sub-divided into different categories for ease of access. However the content is fine to give a base understanding for students.,1278374400,,148,5.208333333333333
8218168,3,B000VD5I2G,"I am a high school physiology and biology teacher. I purchased this to hopefully add to my collection of visual teaching tools. The video is very detailed in the structures of the skeleton. The presenters are clear in their terminology, and the video uses subtitles to show the names of the bones as well. They use an infant and a child skeleton to help compare the differences with adults which was interesting and helpful. The 11 minutes it spends on the muscular system is better than the majority spent on skeletal system.

The video was 49 minutes long, and it was still talking about bones at about 38 minutes (spent 20 minutes on the skull alone). Overall this video has the information, but how it is delivered is VERY dry and boring. I might use it in pieces, showing 5 minutes that relates to the topic I'm going over (or the section on muscles to review the major muscle groups and actions). I will not show it in larger chunks, if I use it at all. My other big complaint with the format of the DVD was that it had a very poor disc menu. You cannot see what the different chapters are as you select them (when played on a computer). I will probably need to note the time of the sections I want and find them that way. This makes it difficult to use in class.

Assuming the other videos in this series are done in a similar format, I will be hesitant to purchase any others. There is much better quality video information available than this series.",1264204800,17,1459,4.4
8218169,5,B000VD5I2G,My wife uses this to instruct her pre nursing class.  Its a great movie for that sort of venue.,1244332800,3,95,4.0
8218170,5,B000VD5I2G,"I definitely feel that I was able to learn vital information from this video. If you're in anatomy classes, this is the video for you.",1222041600,5,134,4.4
8218171,5,B000VD5I2G,"This is the first program I edited in the Just the Facts Series. Within this program and it's two companions, The Nervous System and The Major Systems and Organs are various animations. I did some and Jeff Stone did the others. Jeff taught me how to use the program in a mere 16 hours. Proof on his part and my part that creative minds can do almost anything. Things they can't do, they can fake pretty well and no one knows the difference. I let Jeff have the harder animations because he was more experienced at the program which is After Effects by the way. When I started the class, Jeff asked the class, all two of us, if we knew photoshop. We both said, ""Yes."" So then Jeff says, ""Well, After Effects is like Photoshop on steroids, especially if you have the Production Bundle."" If you have this program and you can't do what you want to do it is because you don't know what you are doing. For example, the heavy storm scenes in the movie The Perfect Storm were shot on a sound stage and the environment, ocean waves, rain, clouds, and lightening all were created in After Effects. Certainly none of the animations in The Human Body are of that magnitude but with the knowledge of how that movie was created, I wasn't about to be defeated when I couldn't figure something out. We wanted the hand drawn heart to beat with an electrical pulse stimulating it. This was too hard for me so I gave it to Jeff. He kind of gave up on it I guess because it had vegas style ramp lights running down it and it wasn't moving at all. Again, I was not to be defeated. I saw what he had done with it and ran to my computer (as much as I could have run, it was like ten feet away), sat down and started over. Three hours later, it was done, Jeff was gone, and I was a little bit smarter than I was when I started. Now, three years later, I often think of making that animation even better but that would cost two hundred dollars easily. The subtle change doesn't justify the cost. Anyway, while The Human Body The Musculoskeletal System is a very good program, compare it to The Reformation which is also available here at Amazon, and you will see how my editing style has progressed.
