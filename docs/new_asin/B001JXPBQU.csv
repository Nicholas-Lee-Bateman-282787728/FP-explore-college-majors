3661472,4,B001JXPBQU,Chakra Balancing Yoga DVD is great it shows you how to open each chakra by doing certain yoga poses. It is very easy to learn these poses and add them to your regular routine.,1300406400,,175,4.176470588235294
3661473,4,B001JXPBQU,"For those who want to go to another level of yoga. The menu options here are based on the 7 Chakras, each running between 7-10 minutes. There are wonderful affirmations, for those who are open to them as well as chants that are very helpful when holding positions. I love the affirmations that push one to integrate something more meaningful while doing yoga. Some of the positions are advanced for me such as the headstand, backbend, shoulder stands. With the Acacia DVDs, you can always pick and choose, which is a great feature. Beautiful, soothing music, set design, and likeable instructor.",1294704000,2,595,4.900990099009901
3661474,1,B001JXPBQU,No instruction given and it moves at a fast pace. Might be great for some but I think the description should make it more clear what it is. I don't see how anyone can really follow along with the poses - it moves fast and doesn't describe what to do. And if not an instructional video then it should describe why to do it - so it could be educational on the subject.,1280966400,11,366,4.027397260273973
3661475,5,B001JXPBQU,"I have taken a yoga-teacher training in Hatha Yoga incorporating the Bij sounds, the mantras chanted on the chakras to stimulate the energy centers and move or release the energy. I struggled through my program. I thought it was bogus, and abraded with the teacher. But I also experienced real effects. I was able to stimulate prana in specific parts of my body, which I later came to understand are connected with nerve plexi and glandular nodes in the body (4th chakra = thymus gland).

Then I came across Sharon's DVD. Wow. I wish she had been my teacher.

The way she chants the bij sounds is so much sweeter than the way I was taught, and the bonus features has her narrating an extremely interesting lecture on Hatha Yoga and the Pradipika. I have bought additional copies and gifted them to special people.

I strongly recommend this DVD as both a resource and as a follow-along practice video. It will, in time, truly unlock emotional traumas and sensations you may not have been aware you have been carrying. In privacy, you will probably allow yourself to truly journey while in your practice, and you will know you are experiencing releases when you begin to throb in certain parts of your spine or neck or head. You may even cry. And it is during these moments that the training prepares you to smile at it all and douse yourself in gratitude for recognizing that thing that happened in the past and to which you are no longer bound to. You can ease it off, forgiving it and yourself, and understanding the process of it all as you give the energy back down to the Earth, or up to the Cosmos.

Truly wonderful stuff. Not so much your typical yoga studio class. Personal and intimate. Builds the best relationship you've ever had with yourself.",1279670400,19,1755,4.597444089456869
3661476,5,B001JXPBQU,This is a brilliant teaching of the chakra system! I love how she sequences the yoga postures to move through each chakra & how we are directed to use our own voices by chanting the sounds of the chakras while we are doing the poses!! It is truly balancing for our entire body!!,1273968000,,278,4.264150943396227
3661477,5,B001JXPBQU,"Great DVD. The yoga includes asanas and chanting, and the asanas are not overly challenging. It's a little hippy-dippy, but it's a great routine for centering and grounding yourself, and it gives you something to think about besides your shaking arms!",1258070400,,251,5.146341463414634
3661478,5,B001JXPBQU,"This is really beautifully done. The setting, lighting, sweeping & close & far camera angles are beautiful. It also shows part of the members of the musicians that are playing during the session. Sharon is in voice over except for the chanting the mantras for each chakra so that you can also choose music only. Because there is no direction on how to do the poses, this is not for newbies. I wish there was more reminders on how each pose helps the emotions/spirit in detail and/or the organs even if it's a separate voice over option. For newbies a separate voice over giving pose instruction at least a little would also be a great addition to get a wider audience.
For each chakra, you do a few poses & hold them for a nice amount of time, to reflect on the subjects she recommends or your own as well as to chant in almost a partial song style of that 1 word for that chakra.

Root Chakra (survival) LAM - (thankful for home/blessings/thoughts to father, then mother, then career, earth) Poses Held: downward dog, warrior 2, triangle, standing on toes (poses also used quickly - plank, cobra, upward dog, standing fwd bend, mountain)
2nd Chakra (sexual/creativity) VAM - (blessings to unresolved business/romantic ties) Held: sitting fwd bend, lean back/fwd sitting fwd bends, single leg fwd bend, butterfly
3rd Chakra (respect for self/others) RAM - (blessings to people you have hurt & animals hurt/eaten) seated twist, simple bent knee seated twist
4th Chakra (love) YAM (forgive others who hurt you) reclined rest, sphinx, bow, down dog, camel, bridge, wheel, reclined knees to chest (up dog)
5th Chakra (releasing cynicism, purifying communication, releasing negative thoughts) HAM (I see myself as a holy being) shoulder stand, plow, plow w/knees to ears, fish, child's pose
6th Chakra OM (purify relationship w/divine) headstand (or half), child's pose
7th Chakra OM (releasing doubt, humility, past teachers) child's pose
Savasana/Rest (going over the chakras)
It ends w/Sharon playing a Harmonium & lightly singing w/no words which is really lovely & to me was the best way to get me to sense energy.

Extras:

3661479,5,B001JXPBQU,"This book gets into the more spiritual aspects of yoga. If you are interested in expanding your yoga practice beyond just as an exercise, then this is a great dvd. If you are interested in enlightenment, and living a yogi/yogini lifestyle, then buy this DVD it is a great place to start.  The bonus features were very helpful as well.

3661480,4,B001JXPBQU,"as a yoga teacher for 15 years i do plenty of reviews of dvd
i have known the jivamukti style and is very much in its integrity of real spiritual yoga for the now generation, sharon takes you through the chakras in poses that coordinate with the chakra then places the meaning, the sound and chant along with that chakra, also i enjoyed alot the fact that she guides you through the mental physical and emotional state of what each chakra represents and therefore allows healing and opening to take place.  not a diffucult dvd to do and does not have that many postures to do and is slow going gives you time to sink into the pose and does not instruct you on placements of the pose, so you should know some yoga before doing this so you know where your hands, feet and mind belong. i really liked this alot and will use this for my own personal healing and growth. i also like the other additional sequences you can add into your practice. get it for sure!",1235952000,12,957,4.316666666666666
3661481,5,B001JXPBQU,i really liked this Acacia DVD a little different take on Yoga balancing the Chakra using your body and breath. i would recommend this for anybody looking into the spiritual side of yoga.,1234915200,5,187,4.696969696969697
3661502,5,B001JXPBQU,"I have tried many different yoga DVD's for the chakras, but none of them come close to this beautiful practice. I already have the ""Transform Yourself with Jivamukti Yoga"" DVD put out by Sharon and David - and I love it, but this yoga practice is a wonderful way to release karma and clear the chakras. I have only done this practice 3 to 4 times, but I already feel my energy clearing. I plan on using this several times a week alternating between this session and the Jivamukti Yoga session. I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in clearing away old emotional debris or unhealthy patterns. Sharon's voice is very soothing and uplifting and I enjoyed chanting the mantras of the chakras.",1446854400,,704,4.64

3661504,2,B001JXPBQU,"This is a soothing video but it's not for beginners. If you are interested in learning about Chakra as well as doing  poses, you might like this. Not much instruction.",1440201600,,167,4.566666666666666
3661505,2,B001JXPBQU,The yoga practice itself was decent but I didn't care for the instructor.  Her tone and demeanor were a little strange.,1436832000,,119,4.666666666666667
3661506,5,B001JXPBQU,"After reading some reviews concerning negative response to her ""laughing"" during part of the session, I almost didn't buy the video because I didn't want to be thrown off by ill-timed laughter during what should be a healing session. I'm very glad I purchased this video anyway. The yoga is relaxing and the words are healing, as are the chants. All of them.

Where she laughs, it really isn't ""laughing"" as we normally consider it to be. It's during one of the chants, as part of the chant and explained during it that laughter is to lighten our spirit, and we need it. Of course we do, and I felt very uplifted by it. If you're doing a chakra balancing DVD, you're trying to bring balance into your life and body for a reason, and laughter should be part of your healing/clearing of negative emotions, remorse, grief, whatever it is. I found this to be a most appropriate way to express that.

Some of the poses are not for beginners and even though I've done some yoga before, will probably never be something that I can do. So, do a lesser version of what she's doing and go with it. For instance, when she does wheel I stay in bridge. When she does the head stand I go into the initial part with my head on the floor with my arms in the manner she has hers, but I do not take my legs off the floor. You can ALWAYS alter the movement to fit your abilities.",1435190400,4,1360,4.287937743190661

3661508,5,B001JXPBQU,"Very healing practice.  It took me through an emotional journey, and the practice brought up a lot of issues that I was forced to work through.  I was skeptical at first, as I'm an avid practitioner of Kundalini yoga, but this is just as healing.  I recommend it to anyone going through a very rough time!  Sure helps me!",1426982400,,321,4.389830508474576
3661509,2,B001JXPBQU,Standing on your head and shoulder stands is bad for your upper back. Please watch youtube on dangerous yoga poses before placing undue stress on your upper spine and neck.,1415145600,,172,4.766666666666667

3661511,5,B001JXPBQU,This DVD is very advanced. The instructor is wonderful. My husband is athletic but had never done yoga before. I purchased this and HE is the one who uses it. He got hooked. He strains his neck easily and this routine seems to help him relieve the pain. He gets a lot of stretching and the breathing exercises make him calm as a breeze (he is normally too fast paced). I tweeted a picture of him holding a posture and got a lot of yoga instructors following me.,1409529600,,461,4.25
3661522,3,B001JXPBQU,"It's okay. It has a lot of ""chanting"" in it, which I wasn't expecting. It a little weird for me....",1407110400,2,99,4.0
3661523,5,B001JXPBQU,"I love this DVD! It's one of my favorite yoga classes. The positions move slowly, so you really get to stretch as you chant chakra mantras. I would suggest this for anyone who enjoys eastern yoga and wants to do more than workout.",1406592000,,230,4.372093023255814
3661524,5,B001JXPBQU,"Most of the DVD's made me feel awkward and out of step, but this one is smooth, and I especially like the chanting/meditation component.",1401321600,,136,4.708333333333333
3661525,3,B001JXPBQU,"I bought back Bending DVD from Sharon Gannon and David Life and was very happy! In fact I have been practice that DVD for the past 2 month every day! It is really a pearl in the earth ocean! I admire a lot their work and proposition of life! I am great fan!
The Chakra Balancing Dvd it is also an amazing proposition for work of the Chakras. It is really a deep study combining the studies of the postures of Yoga with the chakras and bija mantras! Very serious work.
Why I gave 3 stars only? because almost in the end of the the work in which Sharon is proposing here, she starts to laugh. She explain after her long laugh that she find funny that we might think that we are not sacred people. That is fine. However, this is her on thing. I did not find very professional she do that because she is proposing for beginners and maybe advancers practitioners to enter inside themselves and heal some wounds. She is proposing for us to connect to our highest been, to free ourself. That is wonderful. I thing it is fine she laughs whenever she wants, who am I to judge it?
When she propose such a fine study, I aspect she conduct the work until the end with responsibility and integrity.
In the end of the day when we present any kind of classes as a teacher for the world it is entire for the others, to help others and not for ourself.
By laughing in the middle of the work, Sharon cuts the concentration and the connection that I was doing with her thorough her DVD. Pity. If it was not that, I would give 5 starts +++",1397088000,4,1519,4.187713310580205

If you are looking for the benefits of yoga but also want to improve your dispostion and develop a forgiving postive and loving attitude this DVD dives you the tools needed to do so.",1384992000,,458,4.376470588235295
3661529,3,B001JXPBQU,"I highly recommend a person who wants to release negative energy to get a chakra balancing yoga DVD.  I have only done this for 2 weeks and I already feel better.  I feel that I have released energy that has been lingering inside for a long time.

Regarding getting this particular DVD, I would recommend it with reservations.  Here are my observations:
1) The poses are fairly easy and she allows enough time to get into them.
2) I like her voice and music.
3) The instructions are clear and easy to follow.
4) I really like the topics on which she asks me to focus.  I now think about the positive messages during the day and I feel like I am reprogramming my thoughts.
5) The pace of the chants are not even - sometimes they are fast at the beginning and slow at the end.
6) During one of the chakra chants she bursts out laughing which I really find annoying because I am trying to focus on my feelings and energy.
7) The final exercise that requires chanting and breathing is too fast.  There is not enough time to breathe in and out before she moves on to the next chant.  While I know some people breathe at different paces, I simply find her rhythm way to fast for 5 of the chakras.  Now that I know the sequence, I turn off the audio and do the rest of sequence on my own.

This DVD has some good points and some not so good points.  If you cannot find another chakra balancing DVD then I would definitely get this one.",1350604800,21,1428,4.197802197802198

8313995,2,B001JXPBQU,"I caught a short segment of this yoga practice on cable once, and enjoyed it, which is why I bought this DVD.  But, unfortunately, I don't love the practice in total...

First, there is no warm up at all.  This seems strange to me that you are meant to jump right into it.  My body, which is neither super-fit nor super-unfit - does need some time to stretch a bit before being in more active poses like warrior and triangle (these are the very first poses on the video).

Secondly, there is very little instruction and not a single modification option.  I have been practicing yoga for many years, but I still enjoy a tip here or there on ways to improve a posture.  Besides that, a few poses are definitely for the more advanced yogi (like headstand) and not all of us can get into that pose easily, especially without a warm up.  Also, given that I am a woman and inversions are meant to be avoided at certain times of the month, my only option is to sit quietly or fast forward the video (which means I miss some of the chants and verbal instruction) during the shoulder and head stand poses.

And third, I could live without the 'carnivores are awful people' message.  For the 2nd chakra sequence, she instructs to ask for forgiveness from anyone we've hurt - and that it's a mistake to believe we can benefit from an animal's unhappiness (I'm summarizing).  While in theory I believe this, that doesn't negate my choice to be an omnivore, which is really none of her business and doesn't belong in a yoga DVD.  The mini-lecture really detracts from the practice and changes my energy away in a distracting, negative way.

I do like the chanting and the overall message of the practice.  The music is lovely and the length is good.",1454544000,2,1736,4.46984126984127
