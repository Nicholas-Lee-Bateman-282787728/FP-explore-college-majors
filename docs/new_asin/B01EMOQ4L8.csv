7738817,4,B01EMOQ4L8,"Just finished watching ""The Empire Of Corpses"" released by Funimation.
What does it gain a man if he obtains the world but looses his soul?
That is a question a young medical student by the name of John Watson should have asked himself when he sets about reanimating the corpse of his newly dead friend Friday in their attempt to break the glass ceiling set a century ago by the legendary corpse engineer Victor Frankenstein when he produced the only reanimated corpse to have a soul - whose name is ""The One"" in this steam/corpse-punk universe where all wars are now fought by reanimated but soul-less corpses pre-programmed by necroware.
Yet the reanimating a corpse is forbidden and Watson is caught and offered a choice - disgrace and prison, or go on a mission to discover the lost notes of Victor Frankenstein.
Watson is blinded for his love of Friday and his desire to reanimate the corpse of his friend with it's lost soul.
How far Watson is willing to go in his quest to rejoin Friday is disturbing and not for the faint hearted - think along the lines of Dr. Phibes if you're familiar with this horror movie character.
A very disturbing take on the Frankenstein myth.  And an  equally disturbing morality tale on the distances one will go for an obsessive love.
Cautiously Recommended.
Four Stars.",1472688000,2,1307,4.703056768558952
7738818,5,B01EMOQ4L8,This was a very good movie. Animation and story were done veryvwell,1471046400,2,67,4.666666666666667
7738819,4,B01EMOQ4L8,"Ok, so the voice acting is ok (though the voice of Watson waivers a little bit, but not too irritating.) The animation is gorgeous, and the story is interesting enough. My major issue is with the character of Hadary, the only female character.  She's strong, and fun and keeps Watson going, however, her design drives me up a wall. Nearly everything else in this anime is beautifully rendered, and allows the viewer to become really involved in the story...until Hadary shows up with her gravity defying dress and individually inflated boobs.  Seriously she looks like the fevered fap dreams of a sexually frustrated teenage boy.  These become even more disturbing when you find out more about her.  The story sort of falls apart towards the end, like maybe they were going in another direction before, but changed their minds? I never read the original story, but I might. It's certainly worth a watch, and I do want to see the other films in Project Itoh if only for this beautiful animation.",1470614400,6,994,4.795321637426901

7738822,4,B01EMOQ4L8,I enjoyed this anime. Both artwork and story was very good. It was well thought out. I think the end was good but I would do it little different. Whant happen to the girl?! Would have her stay with the guy.,1467849600,3,206,4.048780487804878
7738823,4,B01EMOQ4L8,"This film was released locally for a very brief period - two days so I made an effort to see it. It is a very ambitious undertaking, set in a steampunk world of the 19th century and incorporating historical fictional characters, including the main character John Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame, and the Frankenstein monster. The ""corpses"" are the re-animated dead and instead of being zombies, they are the engine of the industrial revolution, providing free labor and war. The concepts are high, the landscapes are beautiful, and the emotions are touching. Though I can't say the film is a perfect triumph, I was very entertained and recommend this highly. I am adding this to my blu-ray collection.",1463270400,25,700,4.940677966101695
7738824,1,B01EMOQ4L8,"I bought this after seeing a trailer on another disc. The animation is good but the story is just dumb. It centers around some steampunk technology that allows reanimation of corpses to put them to work doing menial work so humans don't have to. The main character is a kid who is trying to learn the secret to giving a soul back to the reanimated corpse so that he can have his lover back whom he has reanimated after the boy commits suicide. The story is a mess and the premise unbelievable even for sci-fi. I sold this blu-ray after one veiwing,I don't recommend purchasing it.",1491523200,2,580,4.481132075471698
7738825,3,B01EMOQ4L8,"The first half was great. Original, good story, decent characters. Then it started to fall apart. This screams ""We read history, but don't know the culture!"" It's just plain idiotic in many places. Second half: Some of the animation is just terrible - it looks like they switched writers and animators midway. Example - noses look like boulders. Hadaly Lilith's chest profile when she's at the helm looks like a 12 year old was the artist - literally sticking a foot out from the front and resembling Hot-Wheel ramps. So idiotic it was distracting, and not in a good way. It soon becomes ""Forrest Gumpish"" - let's see how many famous names and people we can stick in this crumbling mess.

Why the change from almost believable technology to friggin all out magic? What's with the battle between Burnaby and (no spoiler) towards the end? Moronic can't even describe it.

The English voice cast was superb. Excellent work, fit the characters perfectly - although the accents did occasionally slip.

It was worth watching. Once. But never again.",1488067200,,1042,4.875706214689266

7738828,5,B01EMOQ4L8,"One of the Best Anime films I have seen in a long time. Taking a familiar concept of Frankenstein and giving it a ""what If"" premise of what could happen if humanity could bring the dead back to life. Very nice work following Project Itoh's original work. If only they did the same for Project Itoh's ""Harmony"" as they did for this.",1477353600,,331,4.354838709677419
7738829,1,B01EMOQ4L8,This movie is gorgous but it trash. The trailers presented this movie as a psychological thriller it is really a movie with a young Bruce Willis and some cool zombies. I don't blame the technical parts but it lacks character depth.,1475193600,3,231,4.658536585365853

7738831,4,B01EMOQ4L8,"Adsolutely loved it . The pacing was a bit jarring for one of my friends which made me have to pause the movie and explain plot points to him but after finishing the movie I would watch it again no problem.
Hadley and Watson are the characters you'll gravitate most towards and the setting is just Fantastic.
 Cons- the story throws a lot at you pretty fast plot points wise in turn you may have to pause and rewind some parts so you fully know whats going on.
Other then all that its a good movie not Fantastic but a good movie:)",1473465600,,530,4.196078431372549
7738832,2,B01EMOQ4L8,"So so incredibly disappointed. I loved this movie for the first 2/3, but as soon as it hit the climax it just failed. There was absolutely no payoff and the fact that the animation is so flawless is an insult to the work that was put into it. Nothing makes me madder than waisted beautiful animation and this is a great example of that. To me, the ending is PARAMOUNT, and this movie just fails.",1473033600,6,395,4.28
7738833,2,B01EMOQ4L8,"I saw this immediately after watching Attack on Titan (the anime, not the live action movie), one of the best quality, story-telling anime's I've ever seen, so I was surprised at the lack of writing skill  that went into the script for this anime.

If you're going to make an anime about zombies, in an age of outstanding technology, skill, and writing, make one that rivals everything that's been done so far. Or at least one that has it's own focal point of power that puts it above average. For me, this anime was all good graphics, but no great story content. I was very disappointed.

I'll say this, the cover art did its job! I'm a writer who also majored in graphic design, so I fell victim to the lure of dark beauty and powerful story telling, as indicated by the cover art. But I'm not judging the product by the cover, I'm judging it by the content. Empire of Corpses unfolds with ordinary, underwhelming, average story telling skills, which feels disjointed. The title evokes typical expectations of zombie chaos, but the graphic talent and the knowledge that this anime comes from the same producers of Attack on Titan, inspired the hope of discovering a compelling story and characters that I can care about. Even a fantasy uses ""creative logic"" like stepping stones for the imagination to follow. Great fantasy does anyway. The thinking behind this scrip put all the characters in place and began a kind of mechanical story-telling that just assumes the viewer will remain invested. But interest is threatened because of this plot weakness:  when death is no longer a real threat, with corpses walking around and behaving with limited animation and established as normal, a sense of jeopardy is rendered null. There is no longer any real cause for viewer concern and concern is what engages the interest of the viewer. Extra effort has to be taken to develop a story that grips one with true concern. Interesting characters that inspire sympathy can override and rebuild a sense of jeopardy, but this anime's story telling lacks the kind of narrative logic that holds a good story together.

In a world where corpse reanimation is everyday-normal, CONVINCE me why an expert would risk turning his friend into a mindless servant, a dead one, just to keep him around until he discovers how to return his soul to his body. That premise is great and beautiful, but the execution left me unmoved and losing interest. CONVINCE me of the outstanding bond between these friends that would give rise to such an uncommon search for the soul. That's supposed to be the driving force of the story, if so, it should make a strong impact, not just show a few fleeting scenes of the not-very-likable dead guy, 'Friday', before his demise, and assume that I'm hooked. It's as if the quality of work went into the graphics, not the writing. After a slow progression, the story hits the ground running with corpse bombs, floating boobs on an automaton, and scene after scene of average dialogue, questionable structure, and no reason to invest any interest or emotion beyond annoyance.

I was so disappointed and bored by the lack of story craft that I had to watch highlights of Attack on Titan to make myself feel better again. But the cover art for this title inspires empathy, power and drama. Respect to the artist(s)! Too bad the actual anime does not live up to it.",1472860800,4,3369,4.75042735042735

8759198,4,B01EMOQ4L8,Interesting take on the Frankenstein concept - what would society be like if the dead could be reanimated?  Is there such a thing as the soul?,1534204800,,142,4.461538461538462
8759199,4,B01EMOQ4L8,"This is a beautifully animated masterfully done just wow. It makes you think it gives you action, love, horror, pain, death, and the search for the meaning not just of life and death but of what a human is. What a soul is.
