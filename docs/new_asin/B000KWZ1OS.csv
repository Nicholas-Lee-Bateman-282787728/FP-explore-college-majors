8159172,4,B000KWZ1OS,"I have a two-disc set of this series.  Each cover is the same photo as shown here, and one of the discs has the titles shown above.  The second disc program titles are:  THE HOMESTEADERS, DANGER VALLEY, THE TWISTED ROAD, GRINGO PETE, FLAMING GOLD.  Five in all.  However, the set advertised here appears to have only the one disc of five programs.

All of the programs have a certain grayness, or slightly washed out look, but are quite watchable.  The sound has some muddiness but generally is pretty good.  The high point of the series for me is the quality of the stories.  They are good westerns and a cut above the usual fare of the television westerns.

THE TWISTED ROAD features Robert Vaughn in an early role and a surprising climax.  Chubby Johnson is the sheriff.  GRINGO PETE features veteran Ted de Corsia in a good story.  FLAMING GOLD features Rex Allen's friend, Lloyd Perryman of the Sons of the Pioneers as the constable.  I saw Rex Allen and Lloyd Perryman perform a show at Sea World in San Diego in the early 1970s, along with Wade Ray.

If you like television westerns of the 1950s, this is an enjoyable selection of programs.  I give it four stars for the story content.",1412121600,2,1192,4.525821596244131

8159175,3,B000KWZ1OS,"The 39 half-hour episodes of the television western ""Frontier Doctor"" were originally broadcast during the 1956-57 television season. There are ten episodes on this DVD set.  The series was an attempt to mix the medical show and western genres; and to capitalize on the popularity of legendary ""B"" Western movie star Rex Allen, known as ""The Arizona Cowboy"". There had been a series of Rex Allen comic and coloring books along with toy guns and other western merchandise.

Resolution is a bit grainy and overexposed so don't expect a great image-but it is viewable and given the reception quality in many households during the original broadcasts the image will feel like authentic 1950's television viewing. No special features on the DVD's-just the episodes.

Like Gene Autry, Allen was a singing cowboy (he made the last of the singing westerns in 1954) who had gotten a little old for the cowboy hero roles but is fine in the title role of this series.  The stories are about the adventures of Bill Baxter,  straight shooting doctor in the Arizona Territory in the 1880's.  The series was later broadcast in syndication under the names ""The Man of the West"" and ""Unarmed"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1206316800,10,1224,4.850961538461538
