8029089,1,B0002M5U42,"Guys, I love horror movies. I'm a fanatic. And with that admission, I have to also add that I love BAD horror movies with as much enthusiasm as the good ones...

...but not this crap.

A nearsighted, intellectually challenged chimpanzee with a 1985-era video camera could have made better films than these with a cast culled from local convenience stores...I hate to be so harsh, but I'm telling you, even with MY penchant for b-grade tripe (LOVE films like ""Pieces"" and ""Seven Doors of Death""), I can't find one single redeeming quality in ANY of the vignettes in this set. The only reason I give it one star is because there is not an option for negative stars.

Trust me folks...save your money on this one.",1283990400,4,710,4.619047619047619

CONTENTS of SLEAZY SLASHERS 4 Movie Pack:

BACK WOODS-- Perhaps the only movie to ever star a grossly obese crossdressing redneck retardo-genius mass murderer. After witnessing his mother's brutal killing, a hillbilly lad goes on a death spree of his own. Includes such unforgettable characters as Cannonball Boy, Deke, Leroy and ""Itself.""

DWELLER-- Typical Polonia family ""classic."" A UFO crashes downstream from a woodland cabin where three violent bank robbers are hiding out.

NIGHT THIRST-- More Polonia balonia.... An anthology of four short horror stories, rendered by the usual cast of characters and family members. Segments: ""Terror,"" ""Tag,"" ""Demon Forest,"" ""Christmas in July.""

PSYCHO SCARECROW-- Pumpkin-headed scarecrow goes on a bloody rampage! There's more to the plot but, why bother? Ludicrous stuff.
