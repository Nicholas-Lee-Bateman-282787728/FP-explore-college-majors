369115,5,6301820932,I wish it was out on DVD!  It is wonderful to see Christopher Reeve in his prime and to see how life was during the Civil War.,1397952000,,126,3.6666666666666665
369116,5,6301820932,"This film was in great shape and was just what I was hoping and expecting it to be! I had forgotten lots of it, was so  great to now have my own copy!  Thanks!  It is a  very good movie!",1376956800,,186,3.575
369117,3,6301820932,"This movie is pretty long for a VHS tape, I guess, and old too I suppose.  It is difficult for my 87 year old Dad (whom I purchased this for) to adjust the tracking on his player to get a good picture.  I wish this came out on DVD.  I might contact a place near him to see if they can't put it on DVD for him.",1367107200,,309,3.582089552238806
369118,3,6301820932,Good story but video quality was substandard even for VHS standards.  Unfortunately was not able to find this movie on DVD so had to settle for VHS.  The story was good enough that we wanted to take a chance.  Video quality was very disappointing.,1229385600,,247,4.568181818181818
369119,4,6301820932,"This romantic film is based partly on civil war era history.  Perhaps it does depart from the actual historical truth, but the embellishment is much more entertaining.  I could never understand why this movie was not better known, except for its made-for-tv status.  Christopher Reeve is very appealing as the founder of the famous security firm.  The late Carrie Snodgress is excellent as Pinkerton's wife.",1196726400,,407,5.2153846153846155
369120,2,6301820932,"The relationship between Allan Pinkerton and Rose O'Neal Greenhow is brimful with documented and attended drama and should easily yield a tale worth telling through cinema. This particular essay is well-mounted, benefiting from a generous Turner Network budget, accounting largely for the above-normal production values of a film created for cable television viewing, but the screenplay serves up a completely fictional romantic bond between Pinkerton (Christopher Reeve) and Greenhow (Madolyn Smith-Osborne), thereon lowering the potential quality of the piece. The work opens in stirring fashion, depicting the occasion outside Baltimore in early 1861, whereby the detective and his associates frustrate an attempt by Confederate sympathizers to derail a train carrying President-Elect Lincoln, an event from which an entire feature could be shot, as it is replete with suspenseful and exciting incident. It is employed here merely as a quick springboard to Pinkerton's appointment by the President as head of a United States Secret Service, a new agency organized for purposes of counter-espionage during The War Between The States. The Union's Secretary of War assigns Allan to attend a dress ball by way of increasing his societal mingling and while there he and the hostess (and Confederate spy) Rose meet, with an apparent mutual physical attraction a result, especially for Pinkerton. Thereafter, the production is essentially febrile romantic melodrama, although circumstances surrounding the spy's role in the Confederate triumph at the first Battle of Bull Run are well-scripted, with the hope for a Southern victory in the War accurately shown, and as well, the suspension by Lincoln of the writ of habeas corpus is represented accurately during the investigator's efforts to force Greenhow into revealing her Northern contacts. Difficulties are present throughout relating to continuity and logic, perhaps most notably during a scene wherein Rose spends an ostensible final evening with her young daughter in Old Capitol Prison, shortly before her planned execution, while an outer prison yard is teeming with rampaging Confederates chanting, burning benches, etc., as protest of the spy's impending fate; however, they abruptly end their rioting (during which one would be hard-used to hear one's inner thoughts) in order to listen to Greenhow's rendition of a lullaby to her child from well inside her cell. Acting is unnoteworthy save for a brief but telling turn by Carrie Snodgrass as Pinkerton's wife, and unexpectedly by Reeve, a player of remarkably slight skills, but who gives here his best and most focused performance, including generally able simulation of a Scottish brogue; in truth, more successful with his assumed accent than Smith-Osborne with hers of the South, certainly not being Greenhow's native Maryland/Virginia Tidewater dialect, not locatable anywhere, actually, although it probably matters little, since it comes and goes freely. The work is filmed in Atlanta, Macon, and Savannah, Georgia, with the initial scenes of the attempted rail related Lincoln assassination attempt shot at Stone Mountain, where several splendid contemporary regimental bands are heard. Notice must be made of the extraordinary lighting and cinematographic talents of Dietrich Lohmann, accurate and lavish costumes from Jai Galati, and top-flight scenic design by Charles Bennett, all in the service of a work deserving of less due to its storyline's apocryphal point of view.",1166313600,2,3495,5.59622641509434
7815926,2,6301820932,Not all that great a movie.  Good cast.,1518566400,,39,3.875
7815927,4,6301820932,"This is an altered version of the original film. Got this for my husband's birthday and he was an extra in this. In the original at the beginning of the crowd scene, he and others were up close but in this version it's farther away shots and at a different angle. Must've cut out and replaced. Also a couple of the scenes the window lights are too bright as background. Age of a film will do that. Glad to find it though, took a long time to hunt this one down and the storyline is still good. Thanks Amazon, can always depend on you to find treasures.",1501632000,,552,4.168224299065421

7815931,4,6301820932,I enjoyed the Rose and the Jackal very much. Both starring roles are played with quite a bit of passion. Love to hear Christopher Reeve speaking (so ably) with a Scottish accent. Well done.,1426204800,,189,4.588235294117647

7815934,5,6301820932,It took many years of having the VHS version taped from TV until finally in 2014 there is the DVD story.  Alan Pinkerton and Rose the rebel spy have a very good true story and it is acted very well by Christopher Reeve.  I am very glad this story and the filming of it has finally not been lost by stay in an obsolete format.,1416096000,2,325,3.9846153846153847
