Colorful and touching, if occasionally uneven, this story of a Romeo and Juliet like love affair and its aftermath certainly has its moments.  The performances are strong, it looks great, theres some interesting social commentary about the corrosive effects of class and social status. and there are a few good musical numbers.

But the musical element is odd  too much or too little for my taste.  One song an hour is just enough to make their sudden appearance a bit jarring,  not fully integrated into the style.  Theres also a tendency to melodrama and overstatement in the plot and even the (quite good) acting, and some important questions about the ""whys"" behind characters key decisions in this tale of love and loss are left unexplored.

None-the-less, it works well enough to enjoy as spectacle, and heart stuck melodrama to be enjoyable, almost like an old style Hollywood film, if not up to the level of Bhanasalis later, quite brilliant and innovative Black.",1456531200,,1240,4.838862559241706
