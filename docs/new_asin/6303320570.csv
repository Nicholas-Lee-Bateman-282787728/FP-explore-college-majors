621991,3,6303320570,"This is a stylized version of the classic story of the struggle between good and evil inside Dr. Jekyll's heart.  The audio is not terrific, and at times, it can be a little difficult to hear the dialogue, but overall it is entertaining and even sad.  Mr. Hyde is portrayed as quite likeable in many scenes, so it is sad to see his ultimate decline and death.  Dr. Jekyll, on the other hand, never fully develops in this version.  He is already obsessed with Hyde as the story begins.",1195948800,,484,4.404494382022472
621992,3,6303320570,"This video adaptation of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is interesting. It certainly keeps most viewer's attention and throws in some surprises, especially at the very end.

  However, if you are looking for a film that retells the story, you may be somewhat disappointed. This story clearly includes evolution, which was not prevelant in the Stevenson's classic. This impacts the moral!

  In the novella, the moral teaches readers not to engage in their sinful impulses because those impulses will become their identity (regardless of how much someone tries to ""Hide"" (or hyde) their true identity). In this film, the evolutionary viewpoint seems to excuse Dr. Jekyll's behavior almost insinuating that circumstances (such as strict British moral values) forced Dr. Jekyll to become Mr. Hyde.

Note: some of these 'circumstances' are not part of the novella, as Dr. Jekyll really IS blackmailed by someone in this film.

  Overall, the film certainly is not terrible. However, it does suggest that Dr. Jekyll's very being is controlled by Edward Hyde.",1192838400,2,1066,5.181286549707602
621993,5,6303320570,Jack Palance will forever define the leading role in film adaptations of the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale.  His style and appearance were a perfect match for the role.  A must have for the classic horror movie enthusiast.,1168214400,4,217,4.837837837837838
621994,4,6303320570,This is a fast moving version of the Stevenson story that benifits from strong casting. Palance is an athletic and very menacing Hyde. The atmosphere of foggy London of the 1880's is captured quite nicely. All in all alot of fun to watch!,1163548800,5,238,4.558139534883721
621995,5,6303320570,This movie was the first movie version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that did not make me feel sorry for Dr. Jekyll at the end.  The story telling and acting helped to bring forth the directors vision ( or at least what I believe is the directors vision) in showing the progression of Dr. Jekyll slowly becoming Mr. Hyde to the point where the only difference between one or the other is the face they wear.,1156291200,5,402,4.220779220779221
621996,5,6303320570,"I agree with the other opinions that this version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale is by far the best adaptation to date.  I actually give it 4 and 1/2 stars out of five.  I'm still waiting for the film version that sticks strictly to the plot and outline of the original 1885 story.  Anyway, the 1968 Dan Curtis production is the closest we have to the story and the most powerful (more than I can say for either the 1932 Frederic March flick or the 1941 Spencer Tracy effort).  Jack Palance was tragically passed over for an Emmy and Golden Globe for his superb performance of Jekyll and Hyde.  Having read the unabridged edition of Stevenson's tale and after seeing this film I realize (perhaps too late) how the story has always been a metaphor for drug addiction.  Stevenson claimed he quickly wrote the story down after having a nightmare but this is hardly your typical Gothic horror tale.  It's possible Stevenson never acknowledged the story's underlying genius.  Whether we wish to admit it or not, Mr. Hyde exists in all of us and we all have our drug of choice (whether it be food, alcohol,presciption drugs, heroin, sex, religion, etc.) that can bring out the hidden realms of our personality.  This is a lesson well taught by this wonderful and under-appreciated film.  To paraphrase the words of one of the film's main characters, ""If the wisdom of tomorrow is learned through the violence of today, can there really be a tomorrow?""",1146096000,8,1455,4.715415019762846
621997,5,6303320570,". I first saw this TV presentation back in 1969. Then, a local PBS station, in 1978, rebroadcast this presentation in which I've made a VHS tape of that broadcast. Now, after searching, this broadcast is available on DVD.

Jack Palance did a superb performance in the title role. His portrayl as the timid doctor and as the monster were well acted. No other actor (even the original actor who was supposed to have this lead role if it wasn't for a strike that happened during the production, Jason Robards) could have filled the shoes as did Jack Palance.

The classic British scenery and atmosphere made the story more believable and more realistic-not as cardboard as the movies were of old and new.

Classic storytelling at its best.",1125792000,14,736,4.734375
621998,5,6303320570,"This 1968 atmospheric and chilling Dan Curtis (Dark Shadows fame) production, made for television, is without a doubt, the best version of the Stevenson story ever done. Jack Palance stars as the submissive, shy, Jekyll and presents an image of Hyde that you will never forget! Portrayed in a Satanic, violent manner, the appearance of Hyde is clever in make-up design. He is not portrayed as a monster but rather as an unabashed hedonistic barfly, somewhat agressive, comical and evil at the same time. Hooked on the excitements that the night can provide; He eventually becomes ""addicted"" to being Hyde, enjoying the power and rule over women that it brings him. He eventually comes close to criminal prosecution and reforms back to the quiet life that Jekyll provides. However, his associate in chemical research demands money after he discovers that Hyde is Jekyll and Jekyll is Hyde. This leads Jekyll to rely on the drug transformation once more (his leftover bottle) to kill his associate and in doing so, also signs his own death warrant (he is dependent on his associates process of a certain drug to be combined with his own) Seeking escape he contacts a friend of Jekyll and agrees to meet at Jekyll's classroom in the medical academy. This is where a truly monsterous confrontation takes place with police in pursuit and the end will put a scare into you! Palance deserved an emmy for this but was robbed!",1066003200,56,1417,4.859504132231405
621999,5,6303320570,"This was the first version of the story I ever saw so I may be a bit biased. As a long time student of this genre and of this story in particular, I can say that while not the Stevenson novella verbatim, it is still much closer than other adaptations. Of particular note are the references to drug addiction of young people in Victorian London. Mr. Palance gives a bravura performance in the dual role. Is it my imagination or does the Mr. Hyde make-up created by Master Make-Up Artist Dick Smith resemble classic depictions of Satan or perhaps the Satyr? Dan Curtis assembled an excellent cast in a sterling production.  The new DVD version offers enhanced picture and sound quality as well as various subtitles for your viewing enjoyment.  You may consider this video/DVD a valued asset to your collection of this strange story of one man's facination with man's dual nature.

622140,5,6303320570,"Quite simply, the best single version of this Victorian classic, EVER.  I've often said that Jack Palance was seriously underrated as an actor, but in this Made For Television film, he makes his presence known, in spades.  Balancing the high wire act of compassionate physician and evil monster with the skill of a mountain goat, he scales peaks that few actors, if any, have ever accomplished with the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic.  In short, Palance was magnificent.  Although the producer, Dan Curtis (of ""Dark Shadows"" fame) made a major errorin my opinionby shooting it in video, he still managed to capture the spookiness and thrill of this oft-done morality play with consummate ability and restrain.

622205,5,6303320570,"I had the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde DVD versions with Spencer Tracy, and the older version with Frederic March in the lead. Both are great. Spencer Tracy uses hardy any makeup using the story as a change mostly in personality rather than turning into a monster. The version with Frederic March, on the other hand, shows both personality and almost over the top changes in appearance when turning from Jekyll into Mr. Hyde. This is a great version also.

But, this version with Jack Palance, equals or surpasses the other two. Palance does a superb acting job and as this story goes on, his changes go from subtle to more grotesque along with his personality changes. Palace is a menacing figure even when he is Dr. Jekyll let alone when he changes into Mr. Hyde. I have Palance as Dracula which is just as menacing as this DVD. The story emphasizes the battle between good and evil in each man with evil coming to the surface through man's fallen nature, or thru the taking of drugs.

This movie has great gothic atmosphere and the disc is crisp and the color and audio are great. I recommend this DVD to be placed in one's collection of horror movies.",1373760000,2,1150,4.524038461538462

622210,5,6303320570,"I'm not really a movie guy but this is a great movie that would put to shame most of today's or even recent films.  Since buying this movie back in 2009. I can easily say I must of watched it over 30 times.

This movie has what today's movies lack; substance, great acting, fantastic atmosphere, great directing, realistic customs.  This movie has several elements, horror, mystery, suspense, drama as well as being a tragedy.

Today's movies lacking basic elements which result in good movies resort to ""flashing lights"" to get movie goers interested, such as special effects, gorey violence, nudity and any which way to attempt to convince the viewer that the movie is quality.  All this is done in hope of having viewers overlook the bad script, the terrible acting and horrible directing.

Now this is a teleplay from 1968.  It lacks special effects, it does not have gore, nor any of the ""flashing lights"".  When the teleplay begins most may be upset at the video tape quality, that is until the movie starts developing, perhaps after 2 minutes.  The viewer becomes mesmerized.  The dark setting!  The fog!  The somber but suspenseful violins, cellos and bass playing in the background!

And then the movie begins with a debate, one which has been around for a long time, mans attempt to be God-like.  The other debate is of man's dual nature.  Born with goodness but with the capacity to be evil.

From there we jump to Dr. Jekyll beginning his experiments and eventually drugging himself.  We do not get to see the transformation much less the alter ego of Jekyll, at the next sequence we see Jekyll waking late not sure what had happened and he begins to investigate the occurrence of the previous night.

As the movie progresses Jekyll begins to enjoy the life and or pleasures that Hyde provides him.  He takes joy in being immoral, violent, permiscuos...a party animal of sorts.  This until his alter ego begins to become more difficult to control both from the sense of his actions and even from his transformation.  Eventually he is sought out by the police and as he continues to murder.

The great cast makes this movie quite spectacular.  The two stand outs are devlin and Jekyll/Hyde.

Jack Palance is magnificent in his role.  His tone of voice, his imposing pressence, but his acting over all are worthy of accolades.  Overall is his performance as Hyde.  At the beginning he is an abnoxcious, impertinent, loud character; some what comical ( otherwise as known as a party animal). But progressively his lustful tendencies lead him towards a path of violence.  Palance delivers on this progressive change of behavior, displaying delight, in his violence, rage when angered.  His interpretation at first is of delight then the internal conflict which  Jekyll experiences is stuff of real academy award material.  The final scenes are even more impressive above all with Denholm Elliot's and Jack Palance's acting and dialog.  I have never seen much from Palance, but with this movie I discovered what a excellent actor he was.

In summary, this movie doesn't need all the horns and whistles like today's movie simply because it is a great production with great directing, great acting, great custom, great ambience, and a great moral story.  You'll over look the deficient video quality and at times even the poor audio simple put because this movie is captivating.",1322352000,4,3383,4.87719298245614
622211,5,6303320570,"I like this version most of all the versions of Jekyll/Hyde.  Jack Palance really puts it all together.  Very strong performance. Producer/writer/director Dan Curtis is a fave of mine for doing fun made-for-TV films (Scream Of The Wolf, Trilogy Of Terror, The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler pilots & several Night Stalker series episodes, etc.).  Highly recommended.",1313625600,,369,5.553571428571429
622212,5,6303320570,"I was mainly interested in purchasing this because I read that the artist for the old '70s Marvel Dracula series modelled his depiction of Count Dracula after Jack Palance in ""Jekyll & Hyde""; and you will indeed see striking similarities If you compare Gene Colan's early issues of ""Tomb of Dracula"" and this very entertaining teleplay. Strangely enough, Colan's style evolved away from a Palance look to his own thing and then back to a more consistent resemblance to Jack after the actor played The Count himself in Dan Curtis' production a few years later.
  I have little otherwise to add to what's already posted, other than to say that this quaintly stagebound show has for me the rather amusing effect of making me feel that characters from an old ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" episode have wandered into a SERIOUSLY bad neighborhood...
  Also, the the rather pedestrian appearance of the Hyde formula itself (no ominously bubbling beaker here) made me think, as Hyde was running around casually chugging the stuff near the show's climax: ""BOY! That guy is drinking some REALLY strong cough syrup!!!""",1300233600,,1100,5.027472527472527

This portrayal of Jekyll/Hyde is what Palance excels at. In most of the shows he appears in he plays a warped or tormented or maniacal character. I can think of no better description of Jekyll/Hyde. Palance's ability to show a human under the most pressurized states & display the different ways a human twists under that pressure is unequaled. Check his performance in the Silver Chalice & Barabbas. His skill is what makes this a must see.

Don't miss him & Curtis together again in ""Dracula"". They excel at creating a creepy atmospheric ruined human. 5 stars for Dan & Jack.",1265587200,4,801,4.633802816901408

This one is far less widely known, possibly because it was made for Television. However, in my opinion it is possibly the finest portayal of the original story - Jack Pallance is superb in the title role, which he plays with great feeling for the character, bringing all the feeling of the original story and is excellently supported by Billie Whitelaw as the leading female. The make up for ""Mr Hyde"" is far mor subtle than other films and more believable as a result. I would heartily recomend this to anyone as the definative portrayal of Dr. Jekyll & Mr Hyde",1257379200,2,677,4.603305785123967
622235,5,6303320570,"This 1968 production is an excellent film adaptation of the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson tale of the same name. Like its inspiration, this rendition explores the dual nature of man through a character who, in the name of science, delves into the darkest and most vile depths of the human psyche. Although it strays from the original plot somewhat, fans of the novella will appreciate the creative liberties exercised in order to keep this screenplay fast-paced and intriguing. The addition of a Soho music hall dancer, Gwyn, brings a colorful female presence that is lacking in the original; through the inclusion of her character, one understands the depth at which Hyde gives into his earthly desires, and it highlights his utter disregard for the weaker gender through his abusive and cruel displays.

The cast includes some well-known faces, including Jack Palance (Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde),  Denholm Elliott (Mr. George Devlin , based on Stevenson's  Mr. Utterson), and Billie Whitelaw (Gwyn Thomas, the object of Hyde's infatuation). Palance's performance is riveting, with a Hyde who is more wicked than monstrous. The scenery and costuming capture a London of the past; by today's standards, the special effects are dated, but the production is still engaging and thrilling - from beginning to end.

Although the film is not rated, it is most appropriate for children 13 and over. Occasional harsh language, such as the reference to Gwyn as a ""slut,"" may be inappropriate for some audiences.  Several of Hyde's violent acts are somewhat graphic, and although they are only suggested, sexual references involving Gwyn and females in the music hall scenes may be too telling for pre-teens.

This DVD is a must-have for Stevenson fans and lovers of nineteenth century literature. It finds its place among the best of horror films, complete with a Poe-inspired psychoanalytic twist and an Aristotelian philosophical crisis.",1253059200,2,1923,5.207119741100324
622236,5,6303320570,"Dan Curtis' TV production of Stevensons story 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' is watchable for quite a few reasons but it's memorable and essential for one: Jack Palance's performance as Mr Hyde..

I've been watching all kinds of horror and fantasy for many years now; I started as a schoolboy and I've enjoyed/endured everything from the early Universals through AIP, Hammer and Amicus; the Italian 'nasties'; the Japanese all-ins; all the way to the present day and the confrontational-at-best 'Murder Set Pieces' and the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' series.

But nothing I've seen in all those years could've possibly prepared me for Jack Palance as Mr Hyde.

It gives the word 'ugly' new meaning and purpose after years of underachievement; fresh nightmares tumble and cascade in forms not experienced since pubescence.
Big, sneering, snarling faces loom down...

But it's not just the make-up - Palance's whole form and demeanour are taken over by this lithe, fidgety, twitching, homicidal rascal.
A little like the Joker in as much as his face is set in some kind of idiot-grimace, completely in keeping with his lurking, obsessive cruelty.
Like a big lizard jumping all over the place; eyes glazed like a shark; cape flapping like the wings of a monstrous falcon - Palance's Hyde is untouchable.

His Jekyll's good - dedicated and retiring; as is the supporting cast: Denholm Elliot, Billie Whitelaw (billed as 'introducing' even though she was in Hammer's 'Hell is a City' way back in 1960 for me to know), Oscar Homolka and Torin Thatcher.
Sets are effective; it's filmed in that strangely-lit late 60's/early 70's studio style that frazzles your eyes if you sit too close (and Hyde's proud jaw-jut will give you a Grade 2 right round !); music's satisfactory; it's well-paced - most of what you could ever want from a TV version of one of the all-time literary horror classics - but Palance is the bite, the spice, the storm...the 'ugly'.

It should be re-titled: the Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (the Ugly, the Ugly and the Ugly!), a warning should be posted on the dvd box: 'Program contains images of a man in an almost continual state of ugliness which may be disturbing..'
All I needed was to hear Palance say  ""Prove it."" to one of  Hyde's many accusers and my head would've fallen off.

Jack Palance as Jekyll/Hyde: it's not a joke (or if it is, it's a brilliant one!), it's deadly serious.
A straight-faced, earnest adaptation of a great; but you should heed the above warning - completely phony and hysterical or not.",1243728000,4,2547,4.823394495412844
622237,5,6303320570,"I was always curious about this 70s tv production, and im glad i picked it up because it is a very creepy, effective retelling of the horror tale about a kindly scientist whose experiments unleash his darker, monstrous nature; a great production with a strong grisly performance by Jack Palance.",1233100800,,295,4.92
622238,5,6303320570,"For Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to succeed the lead actor has to be truly fearsome and frightening.
Jack Palance delivers!
He is startlingly scary in his unrelenting rush to enjoy the things in life that Dr. Jekyll had denied himself.
At times, you will wonder if Palance had lost his mind and was really an escaped and dangerous psychopath.
But it's just that ""wildness"" that makes this the best production of Dr. Jekyll that you'll ever seen--believable, but DIABOLICAL.",1233014400,,468,4.8625

Back in the early 70's...this movie gave me nightmares for many months and has left an impression on me ever since then! Yes...it's that good! Jack Palance gives the story and role something extraordinary, something that very few actors could achieve; you will never forget this Mr. Hyde! This is not SAW 5...so if you're looking for some worthless slash and gash with senseless violence and loads of gore (with no talent whatsoever)...then this movie isn't for you! If you prefer to see a classic horror story with minimal gore but highly effective suspense and acting...then this is the movie you've been looking for!

7843173,1,6303320570,"This review is for the 2017 Gianni Capaldi film and not any finer films by the same name Amazon still has linked in the review section.

The production opens with the serum already discovered with Jekyll and Hyde doing their transformations. Most of the film seems to center on everyone else attempting to figure out what is going on. There is a presumption the audience is familiar with the base story. Jekyll and Hyde are played by two separate characters who often appear in the same scene as they converse. At times it appears the film is about a descent into madness while other times addiction terms are used such as ""chasing the dragon.""

What you may notice right off is that the acting was sad. The camera frequently frames the back of a person's head as if there is someone blocking your view in a theater. Jed Rowen has a death bed scene that is comical in the ""so bad it is good"" area. Mickey Rooney has a brief appearance as Mr. Louis while Margaret O'Brien plays Miss Stevenson. Charlene Rooney, Mickey Rooney's daughter-in-law also has a role.

Several of the art house and indie fest awards  were achievement awards for the actors and had nothing to do with the quality of the film. Indeed, I would say all the awards were from name recognition.
