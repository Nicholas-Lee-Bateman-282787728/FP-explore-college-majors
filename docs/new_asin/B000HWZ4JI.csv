2644404,5,B000HWZ4JI,I returned the product due to finding it half price on another web site.  My experience in the past with Amazon has been very positive. I was reimbursed my full amount ($26.32).  Thank you for all you help.,1168819200,6,206,4.394736842105263
2644405,3,B000HWZ4JI,"If you like the christmas movies on abc family, you'll like these...a little slow, but heartfelt and leaves you feeling good, if somewhat perplexed that the movie came to an abrupt end.  Kathy Ireland is Santas daughter and Santa threatens to take a vacation from xmas since no one has spirit anymore.  She decides to try and get a family off of the naughtly list to convince Santa otherwise.  Posing as a live in caregiver for the children she enters their lives and tries to change them.  Meanwhile her evil sister tries to thwart her plans so that she can take over as santa.  Kathy is a bit like Roma/touched by an angel, but she has some good moments.  Overall I give it 3 stars.",1166486400,25,684,4.432

They are family friendly films about a woman who comes into the lives of a man and his children and brings love and the holidays back into their homes. It also just so happens that she is Santa's daughter. The acting is a bit cheesy but I've found that to be the case with most holiday films. Recommended!,1446681600,,374,4.136986301369863

2644703,5,B000HWZ4JI,"These movies were delightful.  In the first, Kathy Ireland plays Kristen Claus who becomes a nanny to the Morgan family in order to prove to her father that delivering presents is still worthwhile.  Despite the children's initial behavior, and her sister's attempts to sabotage Christmas by turning it into a day of pranks and jokes all ends well
Some lessons and morals are included.  Fun for the entire family.
  In Twice Before Christmas, Kristin, now mortal, doesn't remember her past though she wants to.  Bill wants to marry her, but her amnesia makes her reluctant.  Rudolpha is up to her old tricks.  This time she tries to trick Santa into retiring so she can turn the North Poleb into a Casino and hotel complex.  Kristin regains her memory of her being Santa's daughter and saves Christmas  and Santa from being only a memory.  Rudolph gets her comeuppance as well.  This is delightful sequel and it has lessons and morals as well.  Suitable for all ages.
These movies are personal Christmas holiday favorites.  Oh, the morals and lessons are worked into the storyline and do not bog it down.",1417478400,2,1103,4.797872340425532

2644810,3,B000HWZ4JI,"This is a Benjamin Button review of Twice Upon A Christmas (2001) and its one-year-earlier predecessor Once Upon a Christmas (2000). Twice Upon A Christmas reunites the original cast and continues the story of Santa's younger daughter's time in the mortal world. It's a year later. The holiday season has fallen once more upon Willowbrook, Oregon, and Kristen (Kathy Ireland) has only gotten closer to the Morgan family. Widower dad Bill Morgan (John Dye) proposes to Kristen, except she's reluctant to accept.

See, that amnesia incurred a year ago (in Once Upon A Christmas) has fully taken hold. Kristen has no recollection of her past, and she's troubled by this. Before she commits to life with Bill, she needs to find herself. Can her once unshakable faith sustain Kristen Claus? The Morgans do their best to resurrect her memory, from cross-country canvassing of people named Claus to hypnotism. But nothing works; there's no record of her anywhere. A despairing Kristen wonders if she's a government experiment, a clone, an alien (she forgot swimsuit model for Sports Illustrated).

In the North Pole, Santa's naughty older daughter Rudolfa (Mary Donnelly-Haskell) has finally been put off punishment (for what she did in the first movie), but Santa should've stayed strict. Freed of her nasty chores, Rudolfa promptly goes back to planning to ruin Christmas and swearing revenge on her sister, Kristen. ""I don't think revenge is allowed in the North Pole,"" cautions an elf. The elf gets pooh-poohed.

Relying on man's insatiable greed, Rudolfa embarks on an advertising campaign to sell off pieces of the North Pole (and, okay, it's a pretty cute jingle that she sings). ""Buy a piece of the Pole,"" she croons sweetly. And so watch the customers order in droves. Here's Rudolfa paraphrasing something Father Time once disclosed to her: ""If Santa starts to lose things and the North Pole as we know it starts to disappear, well, it means that Santa's being replaced."" Rudolfa is banking on a new world order. There's a deal in the works for her to partner up with the Donald to erect highrise time share condos at the North Pole. So, can the Morgan children help Kristen recover her memory in time to foil Rudolfa's scheme? Will her doubting fianc&eacute; (and, honestly, can you blame him?) find it in him to believe in Kristen? Will my North Pole order get to my house in time before Kristen wrecks it for me?

The year before, in Once Upon A Christmas, Kristen Claus launched her campaign to save Christmas. See, the year before found Santa slunk in abject misery. Hear him lament: ""I'd known the mortal world was growing more and more selfish."" Mrs. Claus and Kristen tried to cheer him up:

- Mrs. Claus: ""There have always been the one or two who don't like Christmas. Scrooge...""
- Kristen Claus: ""...and Attila the Hun.""

But more naughty names than ever were crossed off the nice list. There's even a website dedicated to ridiculing Santa. Santa was on the verge of giving it all up. Kristen took it upon herself to prove that the Christmas spirit still existed. Against her father's skepticism, she set out to redeem one name on that naughty list: the incorrigible Morgans.

Once... and Twice Upon A Christmas are mainstays of the Hallmark channel around the holidays, and they're ideal for when you want to plonk the kids down for family movie night. There's nothing objectionable. It's cheesy and predictable and pretty silly but also really sweet. Kathy Ireland stays in her acting comfort zone and anchors the two films. Mary Donnelly-Haskell (""Rudolfa"") makes for a great comic book-type villain, she's so theatrical. I wouldn't be too surprised if the kids watching the first flick end up giggling at Rudolfa's idea of combining Christmas and April Fool's to create a new tradition in which people would give each other mean-spirited prank presents. Imagine, the ""Just Kidding Christmas."" But how will it all turn out? Can Kristen convert the Morgan brats off the naughty list? Will she find romance with their preoccupied father? Will Rudolfa's constant sabotage forevermore dampen the Christmas spirit? Will there be another movie? Hmmm, in hindsight, maybe the Benjamin Button approach doesn't work when reviewing films and their sequels.",1388188800,,4264,4.988748241912799

Even the most cynical movie watcher will get an emotional kick from this movie, made all the more memorable I believe because Tom Dye passed away after making them.

In the film, Santa's two daughters, Kristin and Rudolpha, alternatively try to save and destroy Christmas. The movie doesn't focus so much on jolly St. Nick himself, but rather the naughty and very nice daughters.

However, this movie isn't going to make it into the holiday classics. The acting is decent, but not great. In fact, the movie seems to spend way too much time with Rudolpha, the evil sister/villain, whose acting was over the top, rather than developing the rest of the characters. Kristen Claus by contrast comes across as a bit too pure and kindly.

The film was made-for-TV, and definitely looks it. The production quality looks more like a late 1980s movie than something that came out only a few years ago. In fact, when I was watching it, I was sure it came out much earlier.

Other scenes were just flat out corny. The call to Donald Trump didn't really advance the story and wasn't particularly funny. The movie doesn't even use the real Donald. The ending came a bit too magically and suddenly (I don't want to spoil it, but you'll see what I mean).

2644898,5,B000HWZ4JI,"Both ""Once Upon a Christmas"" and ""Twice Upon a Christmas"" star Kathy Ireland and John Dye. These films take a look at some of my favorite things about Christmas. Kathy Ireland plays Kristin, the younger of Santa's two daughters, who comes down to the world to help a family who are on the naughty list so they can get on the nice list. John Dye plays Bill, the father of the two children, Brittany and Kyle. Their mother died a few years before the story begins, and Kristin tries to encourage their Christmas spirit.

2644940,5,B000HWZ4JI,"This is a very good movie for parents to watch with their children/grandchildren. I am 60+ yrs young, and my husband ordered these because we liked them so much. Kathy Ireland and John Dye are really great together. Funny, but also has something that can help children understand that everything is not just their parents fault. Wish this was around when I was raising my children.
All I can say is, this is a must see for everyone!!!

You would think this movie was made in the 80's ! If you want to torture yourself or someone else go for it, otherwise be prepared!",1200009600,2,356,4.3283582089552235
