203493,5,1936488264,"I had the opportunity to view this DVD pre-release and cannot recommend it highly enough.  For many this is a subject that will be foreign but intensely interesting and pertinent.  If you have ever wondered what the Bible is referring to when it refers to the signs in the heavens you will be on the edge of your seat.  I must emphasize that Pastor Mark is NOT setting dates for any specific event to happen. Rather, he is calling us to be alert of the times and the seasons on God's calendar.  Through knowledge we find understanding and wisdom.  You will be astonished at the material and rich visuals. Thank you Pastor Mark, and LORD bless you.",1395014400,41,647,4.495726495726496

203495,5,1936488264,"Pastor Mark Biltz is a profound and Blessed teacher of Gods word, I find the Torah is in fact a treasure chest,  and the Feasts of the Lord are the Key, Gods calendar is very important in understanding what HE is telling us, when the Blood Moons (tetrads) happen on HIS Feast days, God is sending us a signal.... What is HE saying?  find out in this AMAZING and ASTROMICAL TEACHING!  My spirit is just leaping with excitement inside of me.. ""THE HEAVENS ARE HIS BILLBOARD! A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE FOR ALL MANKIND"" Psalms 19 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

203496,5,1936488264,"We are living in exciting times and it was fascinating to learn NASA's recorded previous blood moon occurrences, the ones this year and next year and that they do not see this happening again on God's feast days within the next 100 years.  God said He set signs in the heavens and we need to understand what He is saying.",1394841600,28,321,4.35
203497,5,1936488264,"Hi my name is Nicholas Wilson and I attend El Shaddai Ministries in Tacoma Wa. where Pastor Blitz Ministers. I have had the privilege of viewing this DVD in its entirety before the release date . This is Pastor Mark's study on the coming blood moons and other signs in the heavens that God is using to communicate coming Biblical events to all mankind. This is probably the most powerful study on this subject you will ever come across! As a Christian this is a must know topic! This DVD will send a shiver of hope up your spine! As Mark unveils the significance between these past and coming events, and how it links with the Hebrew calendar, and the feasts of our God. Mark will lead you through history pointing out the prior blood moons and the events that followed. With explanations of ancient Hebrew text, and clarification of english translations from the original Hebrew text. This is an incredibly valuable plethora of information with""visually stunning"" video. This DVD will truly bless you, and all you share it with.  Be sure to get your copy and leave it out for friends and family to notice and share!  Shalom",1394841600,75,1124,4.64321608040201

203511,5,1936488264,"Mark did a great job with the importance of the Lunar Tetrad. He is off on some of the Tribulation Details, like the start of the tribulation will be a future Passover when the first Exodus started,( Ecc 1:9 history repeats). and conclude on 1 Elu (1,290 day) start of repentance (teshuva), Messiah returns on Yom Terruah (Last Great Trump - tekiah hagadol) and the 1335 (daniel 12:11-12) day is Sukkot (Zech 14:16-19).

I know, everyone will pile on saying no one knows the day or the hour, not man nor  angels... You can teach a future Feast of Trumpets (Yom Terruah) and still keep not man or angle knows the day or hour.  Day four of creation, the sun moon and starts are for time.  Matt. 24:29 says at the end of the tribulation 1 Elul, the sun moon and stars will go dark; therefore no knowledge of time.  1 Tishri, which is the Feast of Trumpets, the ONLY New Moon High Sabbath, (Messiah's Birthday too).  If the sun, moon and stars are dark, how can you have a new moon feast?  If the Seven Thunders are happening causing the sun moon and stars to grow dark and shaking heaven and earth, how will man or angles know the day or the hour after 29 days of shaking of the Seven Thunders?

Again, the key to unlocking prophecy is Ecc 1:9, biblical history is prophecy.  Messiah said ""Pray that your flight not be in winter or a Sabbath"", which is a Hebrew idiom for it will be on a winter High Sabbath; Passover. When the Egyptian Exodus started is when the Tribulation Exodus' starts (Jeremiah 14:16, 23:7-8, Ez 20:35-38, Is 35, 23 Psalm, 1 Cor. 10:1-11 emphasis on verse 11).",1444262400,3,1580,4.402061855670103

203532,5,1936488264,"An excellent documentary presentation of the facts about the Tetrad of Blood Moons and their falling back to back on the Feast Days. Mark Biltz presented the facts and correlated all the data from NASA and brought out the significance of their occurring on Passover and Feast of Tabernacles back to back in 2014 and 2015 and ties them in with Biblical prophecies concerning the End times. I recommend this video as opposed to a movie drama about the Blood Moons. These are exciting times to be alive and serving the God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob and looking forward to the return of Yeshua Ha Mashiach...Jesus the Messiah.",1440374400,2,622,4.715596330275229

203550,5,1936488264,"The best book out there on the subject.  Very insightful and detailed explanation of the tetrads of 2014 and 15.  It's funny how the naysayers claim those who ""believe"" in the blood moons think the world is going to ""end"".  No where does Biltz say that.  His observation is such that the only times in history where 4 blood moons fell on ""Jewish Feast Days"" within a 2 year period, there was a MAJOR world changing event which affected history forever for the Jewish people, the land of Israel and the people of the world.  It's a very interesting phenomena to ponder.  And with the final blood moon in this series occurring in Sept of 2015 and looking at the events in middle east and Israel in this past year (ISIS anyone? Those wanting to claim Jerusalem is not in Israel???) ....wow, I'd say when looking at the historical pattern we are in for someting big.",1436486400,2,862,4.493589743589744

203591,5,1936488264,"For starters, I buy a lot of products on Amazon and hardly ever post, and I think this may be the first 5 Star rating I've ever given. But, you must get this and watch it for yourself.

When GOD reveals something to the initial person, they are called/anointed to tell that specific message. Therefore, if one must always gravitate towards the original source first, then look at the works of others as a secondary or sub-source of additional supporting information. In most cases you will find the original sources has more meaningful and thought provoking content/substance to his/her topic.

I don't know Mr. Blitz, never met him, nor have I ever heard of him prior to reading a review concerning his Blood Moons DVD/book about two weeks ago. But, it is clear that he was inspired to write/publish the book and DVD on this topic (recently obtained both). Some preachers dismiss this information and that's their right to do so.

A few questions I was left with, when he speaks of the 4 Blood moons in a row would love some clarification on ""In a row"", also he speaks of the Moons as being a judgement upon Israel in 47 and 48 and also in 67 and 68 wasn't it a blessing for the State of Israel? And if it was for a sign wouldn't you expect it to happen in the same time frame as 1947 and 1948 not 1950 in the wake of Israel becoming a nation as it could not of been a warning if the Moons came after.

203624,5,1936488264,"The Virgin Bride Vision

After between 30 and 40 days of seeking God with an emphasis on plenteous speaking in tongues, I experienced a 30 to 40 day prophetic encounter of God. I can't say exactly how long I was being consecrated because I was seeking God devotionally, not religiously. I do know that for the 30 days leading up to my theophany, I was in a very consecrated state avoiding TV, music, and other good things to give myself to prayer, tongues, and scripture. The mantle on my life was acutely active during this month. The first month of the God encounter, I did not sleep except for 2 nights. After that, the anointing waned slowly; so that, I was sleeping a few hours a night until I returned to normal-- a new normal. Now, if I speak in tongues for a couple of hours during the day: in the middle of the night, I will be wide awake in the overwhelming prophetic anointing. I feel the fire surging through my being 24/7. I have entered a continual communion with God where He is ever present in my flow of consciousness and in my body in a tangible and pronounced way. I say this not to brag, but to encourage others to pull tongues out of the tool box; and, use it more. Whatever gifts one has down inside of her will be activated and stirred up into manifestation with little effort. Tongues is like an old fashioned hand water pump. Pump away; and, pretty soon, the anointing will be gushing out of you.

Beginning on October 28, 2013, waves of prophetic anointing began to sweep over me causing a hyper- prophetic state-- an enthusiasm or exstasy which was nothing short of habitation. For the next 30 plus days, though I was working the whole time, (driving down the road in a visionary state, it was something else) I experienced an overwhelming visitation especially from 7 PM to 7 AM each night. I mainly just laid in the heavy glory of God-- merged into His omniscience-- receiving and writing down the things coming to me. I, also, read Graham Cooke's prophet book during this time. There is nothing like a good prophet book to deflate you when you are having visions because prophet books are inevitably about humility, submission to the body, and such, to keep you grounded and calm you down. Of course, I still took my wife on dates, etc., because you can't simply ignore your wife. The God of my visions expects me to give myself to her, and it is my good pleasure to do so as I love her as truly as Wesley loved Buttercup. We would go to the theater, and God would still be speaking to me both inwardly and through the film. The presence of God was so strong and revelatory that I did not require or want sleep after the first few days of my encounter. I dreaded 7 AM. I was not tired or fatigued during my work hours even though I am a peasant laborer.

During this time, I received communication through a variety of means including revelation, inner voice, inner image, audible voice, outward open vision, prophetic dream, sermons, angelic visitation via dream and a visitation by God, Himself. To clarify: As I lay awake in the presence of God, at times, I would doze off just long enough for Him to set up a scenario in my dream; and, then, I would pop back awake to the audible Word of the Lord. For instance, on November 1, 2013 at 2AM, I nodded off just long enough for God to set up a dream scenario and popped awake to the audible Word of the Lord saying, ""You are returning from the wilderness in the Power of the Spirit."" At one point, I dozed off and an angel came and gave me a message via dream; and, then, I popped awake and responded to him. I have been exercising prophetic gifts since the 1980s and have prophesied over many people and in many church services. However, this is the first time I have ever seen or knowingly encountered an angel; and likewise, I have never received a visitation from the person of God until now. Another method of communication which He uses frequently is just to quicken details to me by causing me to notice them. For instance, during this season of habitation, He frequently led me to glance at the clock just as it was reading 12:34. I understood that He would reveal the meaning of this in due time. There is no point in trying to figure things like this out; you'll just miss it. Patience.

In general, God spoke to me of my own commissioning, and He showed me what He wants to do in the end time Church. He has a dream and a plan to bring the Church into an incredible HARMONY and powerful demonstration before men and angels greater than anything ever before. The Bible records the lesser things; this will be the greater. No move of God or powerful demonstration recorded in the Bible will compare to this. I saw how God wants to go into public schools and public stadiums in demonstration of His wonders. They are teaching in the school that God is dead. He wants to go right in there and demonstrate that He is alive; it is academia which is dead. The world is desperately trying to undo the division into races at Babel, but racial divisions and ethnic wars will wax worse and worse. Meanwhile, in the Church, God is creating a new race from all nations which He will bring into greater and greater harmony. The Jews were broken out of the olive tree in part, and the Gentiles were grafted in. The Jews will, now, be grafted back into the tree in large numbers-- making one new man out of both. (Eph 2)

This particular testimony is related to the communication of the 2 days which God had me to sleep through the night. The first was the night of the visitation of God; it was the night/morning of the 13th/14th of November. He had me to pull the bed covers up over my face, and He passed over me and spoke to me about things I am not publishing, here. In this visitation, He was speaking to me by inner voice, and the anointing was not any more overwhelming than what I was experiencing every day at the time. I was underwhelmed by it, actually. The prophetic anointing is acute and strong and stimulating. It makes your eyes dilate, and it keeps you awake. (No wonder the watchman is found awake while the rest of the church is found sleeping!) The anointing, this night, was more well- rounded, warm, and comforting; I slept like a baby that night.

He was talking to me about our covenant partnership; when, as if out of the blue, He suddenly brought to my mind a young girl and said by inner voice: ""She has never consummated a marriage; in fact, she is a virgin. She is 28."" Though symbolic, she was not a fictitious image. This was a person I recognized, but did not (still do not) know. I had seen her at a church which I was attending at night. Though I had seen her only from across the room a few times, she wore a giant wedding ring, the kind you can't fail to notice; and, then, she wasn't wearing it. I assumed she was divorced. I still do not know her marital status, but it does not matter because she was a prophetic symbol which ties my visionary experience to concrete realities and future events foretold in the Bible. She represents the Church, the Bride of Christ, who will not have consummated a marriage with anti- christ when Jesus Christ returns.

Not knowing who this girl was, I asked someone her name; and, in spite of my vague description, managed to find out. I googled her and found her to be 22 rather than 28. This detail was troubling news because I received other details about important matters in the same communication.

The second night that I slept all night was November 27. I popped awake on November 28 at 7AM to an open vision, i.e., my eyes were opened, and I was seeing a vivid image in midair of this same girl dressed in a wedding gown. I understood that I was seeing the Psalm 45 bride of Christ who is arrayed in white with gold accents.

Two weeks later, I went back to church hoping to query the girl, but God did not allow it. Instead, the following day, God spoke to me by inner voice saying to me, again: ""She is 28."" I understood, then, by revelation that He was referring to her birthday. Revelation is another common way God communicates prophetically. You just know things inside without any voice. I went back to the internet and determined that, indeed, her birthday is September 28. I hope you are noticing the repeating 28s here. When God is trying to say something important in the language of the Spirit, He may use more than one method compounded together. Otherwise, you could wake up tomorrow and wonder if God really said that.

A year later, on November 4, 2014, I had a vision within a lucid dream state. I would consider this an open vision while asleep rather than a prophetic dream. I saw this same girl as Snow White laying in the glass case. Remember the story: the enemy seduced Snow White into eating a poisoned fruit which caused her to enter a state of ""sleeping death"" from which she could be awakened only by true love's kiss. I cannot help but think of the Church, whose sin was scarlet but has been washed white as snow. Though she enter a state of death by eating of the poisoned fruit, her bride groom will come again and awaken her through bodily resurrection. I also, cannot help but think of the parable of the ten virgins. All ten were asleep, both the five wise and the five foolish; only the watchman was awake when the bride groom came. Wake Up! Trim your lamps! Your bride groom cometh!

On about October 8, 2014, it all came together for me when I read the following article from Reuters:

Early risers across much of the world are in for a treat on Wednesday morning - a total lunar eclipse, also known as a ""blood moon"" due to the coppery, reddish color the moon takes as it passes into Earth's shadow. The total eclipse is the second of four over a two-year period that began April 15 and concludes on Sept. 28, 2015.

I instantly understood as God quickened to me that the 1234 on the clock was referring to 4 blood moons the last of which is a super moon appearing on September 28, 2015 ( the maiden's birthday.) It gets better. The 4 blood moons fall on the feast days of Passover and Sukkot (tabernacles) both years. And--a total solar eclipse occurs just prior to Passover in 2015. This is a rare occurence. There was a tetrad in 1949, 1950 just as the Jews returned to the promised land from all nations after Israel became a state in 1948. It happened again in 1967, the year the Jews regained possession of Jerusalem from the Arabs in the Six Day War. Something is going to happen! The Scriptures predict the darkening of the sun in coordination with the blood moon as a major prophetic sign of the end times. God, then, led me to stubble upon several books on Amazon teaching about the coming tetrad which suddenly turned up in my sugggestions since I had been putting books on prophetic ministry into my Christmas wish list. I am browsing my Amazon; and, suddenly, there are book covers of 4 blood moons!! I heartily recommend the book and DVD ""Blood Moons"" by Mark Blitz.

In my visitation, one of the major prophetic words coming to me was from song lyrics to which He led me by having the tune play in my prophetic plane for two nights until I looked up the lyrics. By two nights, I mean: it played continuously from 7PM to 7AM the first night instrumentally only. The next morning God led me to what I thought was the song. The song called into question the ""God is Dead"" theology of existentialists. The next night, as soon as the anointing started coming on strong, the song began to play, again; and, I realized that I had the wrong song. I went to Amazon and looked up this artist's songs. As soon as my eyes fell on the title, I knew that even the title was the Word of the Lord to me. The song was very relevant to my situation almost in its entirety, and a number of passages came to pass, immediately. One of those lyrics was ""the red light goes on to say it's time to begin."" I prayed every night under black light-- as soon as the black light came on, the prophetic anointing poured into my room in overwhelming glory, and I communed with God. I understood at the time, that it referred more importantly to the ""blood moon"" but did not realize that the tetrad of blood moons was about to occur in the coming 2 years immediately following my God encounter.

Another lyric said, ""Maybe a kiss before i leave you this way, your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say."" Remember Snow White. The first night this lyric-less tune was playing in my prophetic plane, I became a prophetic sign where I received a kiss from God's Spirit which left me out cold with my mouth opened, tongue out, eyes opened, hand in toilet; yet, having an inner vision. In this sign, as God's prophet; I represented Him. The toilet represented me. In my self, I am just a urine filled toilet. But as God put His hand into me, I became a vessel of pure water. As He moves His hand, a prophetic stream flows out of me. The song lyrics say, ""He who laughs last is just a hand in the bush."" God, of course, sits in the heavens and laughs at the armies of men arrayed against Him in vain. He destroyed Egypt with the least stutterer, and He can use the mouth of His own madman puppet to mock Nietzsche whose god is dead.

This experience changed me and produced in me both a desire purging consecration and a baptism in fire. From that day on, I am carrying a baptism in fire which burns inside me and causes me to jerk and shutter as it moves inside of me. I feel as though my whole vessel has become a keg of nitroglycerin waiting to be poured out. The very next night a visiting minister preached on a coming ""baptism of fire"" which would purge the desires. He said he received the message as an unexpected sudden download from God while preparing for this meeting. As a visual aid, he brought a water purifier filled with urine --er um-- colored water which became clear as he preached. He also brought an overhead picture of a flaming man. I am become a burning bush at the mercy of the one who requires me to go to whomever He pleases and say whatever He wishes. I am hearing Him too clearly to resist. This is a very frightening prospect, and I am scared to death of it.

The initial lyric of the tune said, ""The light in the window is a crack in the sky, A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye, a levee of tears..."" This describes my life at the time. I am a window cleaner going along from pane to pane passing my time praying as I go. The mantle on my life becomes active as I stir up the gift by speaking in tongues; and, suddenly, the light in the window becomes a crack in the sky; and, revelation floods my being-- a stairway into the darkness, revealing the hidden things, causing a levee of prophetic tears to break forth from my spirit. I go along washing and weeping in the overwhelming presence of God. However, the title and theme of the song is ""No More Tears."" This God encounter changed my primary manifestation from tears to fire.

The overarching vision of my encounter was of a flaming charcoal briquette which ignites a pyramid stack of briquettes. The whole stack, then, turns into eyes which open one after another until the whole stack of opened eyes is transformed into a single compound eye. This is my commission. I have been moving in the prophetic since the eighties. This is not that. This is the future! The Word of the Lord has profoundly come to me in my desert-- coming from the outside like the Old Testament prophet while at the same time echoing from within and mingled with my being like the New Testament vessel whose characteristic is the Word clothed in flesh.

God is going to gather the prophetic people, baptize them in fresh prophetic fire, and harmonize them into a compound eye. We each see in part and prophesy in part; but, together, we will see in a fullness that will cause the holy awe of God's omniscient presence to permeate the assembly of God's household. It will be impossible to play church: to lie to ourselves and each other in that atmosphere. It is the bright exposing light of God's glory that caused Adam and Eve to hide from Him. All will bow down before Him and cry out for His way and His will to be done. Those who will not, won't dare join themselves to the household of faith at that time. In the overwhelming presence of God, prayer ceases; and, all that matters is God's will, desire, and wish. Yes, Master; Your wish is my command; how may I serve You, Father?

Pehaps, God is preparing to kiss His bride and awaken her from her sleeping death under the infuence of the enemy. I don't know what is going to happen. God did not tell me what would happen; He only pointed to the coming blood moon tetrad and let me know it would be time to begin for me, personally. ""The red light goes on to say it's time to begin"" not to say it's time to be raptured. I don't believe for a second that God intends to deliver the Church from the very hour for which He is preparing her. It is noteworthy that there is not a single prophetic company which believes in pretrib rapture: Not CI, not IHOP, not Morning Star, not any school of prophets. Listen to the prophets, Church. You will rise to maturity and face the enemy whose only weapon of death has been defeated by God's trump card-- resurrection from the dead!

My guess is that what is coming will be both a Great Awakening and a Great Tribulation, simultaneously. Judgment will begin at the house of God, and everything which can be shaken will be. Those out there hawking their brand or their ministry instead of preaching the Kingdom of God are going to be beaten with stripes when they face my God. The wind will blow like a hurricane, and whoever does not bow over will be broken. God will have His way in His Church, in Israel, and in the earth. Every mountain will be made low and every valley filled in. I suspect that Israel will come under jihad, and the temple may even be captured. It could be the Ezekiel 39 war where Israel is surrounded by Arab nations which are devastated by an Israeli victory. We have already seen in 2014, that the Mideastern Church has been largely martyred, enslaved, or subjected to Islamic concubinage. Kingdom of God, Come!

# No-peace-upon-him as the doctrine of hatred a web of such deception that only Satan could have invented Islam to destroy all of humankind by proselyting themselves on woven rugs spreading their heresy up to our Heavenly Father and poison the plant earth.

Complicated isn't it to understand this insanity and why is it so confusing, perhaps by evil intent?  Such is the thesis of SATAN who so reins over earth to harm, kill and destroy Gods chosen people by the hand of a false and illiterate so-called prophet along with his self-grandees appointed pagan deity called, Allh; to carry out Satans evil and instruct the condemned souls with such foolishness as they desire death for Allh according to Satans plan with the promise of a Jihad and to reap the rewards of the 72-virgins.  What about the Eves of Islam?  Whos waiting in paradise for these blindly cloaked women who have been diminished to sex slaves on earth for the black hooded Adams to carry out their caliphate?  Whose grandiose plan is it for this ends of days they so desire?  Whos going to prevail on earth as it is in heaven and whos forever consigned to the fires of HELL, lest we forget to believe by loss of our faith?

A vision came to me in a dream of my moments stood still in time with the beginnings of days until the ends of time.

 There was Adam and Eve; a magicka belief of Islam were of Gods human creation, whove so fell from grace by sin, expelled from paradise by the temptation of Satan.
 There was Noah; a righteous man built an ark to begin again after the great flood by Thy Wrath against the godlessness of pagan worship, again by the hand of Satan.  Then God delivered the promise of hope with a rainbow.
 There was Abraham; father of two nations and chosen by God.  Then came forth by Abrahams seed, Ishmael from Hagar with the blessing to prosper of other nations. Then came forth by Abrahams seed, Isaac from Sarai; child of promise begotten for the chosen people, spared from sacrifice to bring forth the new Lamb of promise.
 There was Moses; I Am, said He, I Am.  Moses obeyed and the first born male Jewish slaves of Egypt were spared at Passover and freed for 40 years times 40 more to live by Gods Commandants of the Covenant until Prophets proclaimed the Son of Man would bring forth the promise and to be saved by Grace.
 Yeshua; Son of Man, Lamb of God came forth until the day and time of the end of days in a blink of an eye to fulfil His promise and like a Lion to defeat Satans chain of evil on 2/3s of all mankind for salvation of the remaining and righteous third, for:  I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.  Ezekiel 25:17.  Yeshua was and is Perfect forever without end.
 Past-present Muhammad, self-proclaimed slave and messenger to a spurious pagan god named Allh, was purveyor of the nations of Islam and by the translation of Islam is submission to Allhs and their jointly evil whims to oppress lost souls and bring forth the antichrist to condemn their ilk to the gates of HELL for their final end without beginning.

 Taqiyya, Islamic principle of lying for the sake of Allh is okay by Satan who is so perfectly happy by this deception because he wrote and created the Quran with a fake god in mind to replace the Torah and attempt to destroy the fulfillment of the New Covenant by Grace such as the hoax of the gospel of Barnabas.  Satan enlisted Muhammad to follow this sham willingly by greed and conquest.  Then Muhammad appointed himself as Allhs holy messenger to further corrupt, suppress and torment humankind for satanical whims of earthly things while the sado-submissives head-to-toe in pajamas raise their offensive stink up to heaven five times a day with their repetitive and hollow Muslim prayers without beginning or end.  Whats the point of all of this madness of a 1400-year-old occult that still thrives?  Why not?  Satan exists and thrives to despise Gods creation and he is forever consigning the lost souls by mans freewill to the depths of the lake fires in HELL.",1413072000,3,4263,4.539267015706806

(The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.

203733,5,1936488264,"Bought this DVD because it caught my interest and curiosity. Expected it to be more ""astrological"" or scientific than religion based.

203736,1,1936488264,"First, let me say I have been an avid student of prophecy for many years beginning back with the first publication of ""The Late Great Planet Earth"", so I have some familiarity with this type of presentation.  This one was just plain bad.  For starters, there is an annoying soundtrack throughout the video and it seems to have no purpose other than to try to cover the fact that this author doesn't have much to say, and it is so loud it makes it difficult to hear what the presenter says.  The intro is very very long and padded with a lot of verbiage that, when you try to take notes on it, boils down to the author's assertion, ""the four blood moons are important.""  He then talks about the tetrads but leaves off the dates, so I wonder how important he thinks they are.  He gives no detail on what happened on these dates specifically, although he mentions things that happen close to them.  I guess that if I was decoding Heavenly signs I would talk about them specifically for the duration of the video.  The DVD is chock full of the kinds of images that worship leaders put behind the lyrics of the worship songs on Sunday morning, and at least 50% of the time have nothing to do with what the presenter is talking about.  After the intro, he doesn't mention the Blood Moons specifically again very often.  He does, however, try to draw meaning from the Hebrew letters in Zion, and other words, which, to my mind is blatant space-filler because he has run out of things to talk about.  Beyond this, it is easy to see he has based it on the works of others like Jonathan Cahn, but is apparently unable to approach the topic with anything like their depth.  This DVD is nothing more than an attempt to jump on the bandwagon and make some money - not that I have anything against making money, but when you do it you should at least give the customer something good as opposed to this tripe.  If you don't believe me, buy it and watch it.",1398297600,15,1942,4.349030470914127

He has put together a very readable book which I just couldn't put down, finishing it over two day's time.  This is a must-read for Christians everywhere.

203746,4,1936488264,"I know my Sunday School teachings well enough to know that, one day, mankind is due for the ultimate Biblical comeuppance.  Were sinners, and, as a consequence of that and our failure to find our way to the Lord, were destined to pay a high price.  What we don't know is when that fateful day will arrive, but Pastor Mark Biltz may have found signs that suggest a global reckoning isn't only just around the corner but also God himself has been announcing those intentions as plain as the nose on our face or the moon over our heads.  Blood moons, that is.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

The story here is far from typical.

Essentially what were talking about is the end of life as we know it and the emergence of the way life ought to have been lived (or better will be lived, depending upon ones convictions), and its done in a way avoiding all of the usual clamor involving the Book of Revelations.  (In fact, Revelations really isn't mentioned in any measurably context here.)  Yes, in case you missed it, BLOOD MOONS is about faith and God and Jesus and all things spiritual, and  despite what others might tell you or would have you believe  it isn't about indicting any particular faith or behaviors stemming from an ignorance of it.  Rather, its only an extrapolation of one area of religion: whether or not were being prepared for whats coming.

As Ive implied above, I think most of us are well aware that the Bible speaks of an end times we cant imagine having to face, but Biltz goes to great lengths to avoid the typical doom and gloom.  Instead, BLOOD MOONS concentrates on exploring the method behind the madness to uncover what Biltz believes are messages being broadcast in the world-at-large for all of us to see with tools God created with that purpose in mind.  And its a fascinating voyage of discovery as the man recounts how he stumbled across it by blind chance; it grows in ways that are entirely organic as he pulls back the layers of deception put in place by mankinds own folly.

I don't doubt Mr. Biltzs scholarship.  I don't doubt his reputation.  Heck, I don't even doubt his interpretation.  Its all presented in such a way that its hard to find fault with any of it.  After all, hes done the research, and it would appear his only intention here is to share his lifes work with his fellow man.  In short, I admire anyone with that commitment.  I admire anyone with that dedication.  In this modern era of cynics and skeptics, I find the purity of his pursuits to be more than a bit refreshing.  However as one of those lifelong cynics and skeptics I simply don't possess the knowledge the effectively evaluate his message to the masses.

Therein lies the problem with faith-based productions: how can you communicate the message without drawing the attention of the audiences well-established filters?  Because Im a cynic  because Im a regular news junkie and I know how many times before a pastor or religious leader had promised a Second Coming only to see the date come and go  I almost automatically raise filters when Im viewing or reading such material.  Because of mans own history with trying to predict the end of days, Im predisposed to question nearly everything Im told  even when I lack the necessary education to legitimately debate the merits.

Ive been told (in Sunday School, no less) that we won't know when that crucial time is coming, but we should always be prepared for it.  I think thats a sentiment Paster Biltz and I could agree upon  and that might be the only one.

BLOOD MOONS (2014) is produced by WND Films.  DVD distribution is also being handled by WND Films.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly assembled production, and no expense has been spared in bringing this message to life.

RECOMMENDED.  Im certainly not going to pretend that I understood everything in this 70 minute presentation.  While I found most of it compelling, theres also an unspoken promise in BLOOD MOONS of things to come that, unfortunately, Ive heard before.  No doubt, many of us had heard of mildly prophetic predictions of our doom.  In fact, every few years something makes headlines of this nature, whether its Y2K or the end of the Mayan calendar.  What elevates this film to greater meaning is its reliance on the biblical calendar for interpreting such events; but as Im no expert in that field, Im found in the precarious position of concluding, Ill just have to take your word for it.

In the interests of fairness, Im pleased to disclose that the fine folks at WND Films provided me with a DVD copy of BLOOD MOONS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1396310400,10,4993,4.6442417331813
