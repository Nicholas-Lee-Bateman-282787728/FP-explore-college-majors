8205183,5,B000SF32X4,"I don't own a million exercise videos or equipment, so I'm not an expert.  I just know that I have been using this collection for over 5 years and while I don't do it as often as I should I love it.  Sometimes I add ankle weights to the bun and thigh sculpting for an even harder routine.  IF you follow the program with the recipie book it does work.  I used all the videos and diet to tone up after my first baby and now I'm using the bun and thigh sculpting to help rebuild by leg muscles after tendon surgery.  If you're looking for a good, peaceful, at home routine that doesn't have an annoying instructor shouting in your face, and that doesn't take more than 30 minutes a day, this is it.",1214611200,,696,4.125925925925926
