8499408,3,B000KZRKE4,"I love everything about the old planations especially in Louisiana.  This DVD is wonderful - except the last part of the DVD is messed up.  I returned the first one that I received and a second one was sent to me, however it is messed up the same as the first.  I am assuming now that all of them are messed up on about the last 10 minutes of the DVD.  It is very interesting and shows several of the old houses that now are in ruin.",1217203200,,433,3.942528735632184
8499409,5,B000KZRKE4,"This DVD is AMAZING!!! It's all about the ""lost"" plantations along the River Road....Germania. Le Beau. Whitney. Keller/Homeplace. Ashland...and more, some I've never heard of....the Germania one is so, SO sad...that's the one that is in Vestiges of Grandeur with all the furniture and bed and stuff with the ceiling falling in...they actually have a descendent and they talk to him. I think Germania has completely collapsed, with everything in it, since the filming of the DVD...the entire DVD centers around the slave experience and the effort that is now underway in some areas to bring that bit of history to the forfront. It's just so important to chronicle and try to save the old homes...so much attention is given to the grand dames such as Oak Alley, and rightly so, but after watching this DVD it's apparent how much has not only already been lost, but how much is in danger.",1181174400,4,886,4.8355263157894735
