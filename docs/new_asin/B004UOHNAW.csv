4469640,2,B004UOHNAW,"The show is good as ever, the price is decent...  But, wow, you'd think they would have remastered the content or used a clean source. The picture and sound are really poor-- fuzzy, muted, and muddy. I'd say VHS quality at best. I guess its authentically retro, because it looks and sounds almost exactly like I remember it as a kid over the rabbit ears antenna...

I've got dozens of 80's cartoon sets: GI Joe, Transformers, Voltron, He-man, and this is the lowest quality of all. The others show its possible to release a high quality set on DVD but this one feels like a cut-corners money grab. The packaging is cheap (plastic DVD case with sleeve) and the extras are pointless as well.

*Note* The reviews for the 2011 and 2005 box sets seem to be merged together. I'm reviewing the new cheaper (2011) set on 2 discs. However the older (2005) box set has over twice as many episodes for only a little more money making it a better value.",1313366400,,941,4.459302325581396
4469641,5,B004UOHNAW,"I am not sure what one of the other reviewers was reffering to in reguard to the episode ""Unholy Alliance"", but in this release the episode's problems seem to have been fixed.

It has the beginning animation sequance like all other episodes on the two disks and it's in episode music too. It feels like whatever audio problems were in the original release, they have been fixed in this one.

So if you are shopping for a copy of the DVDs, look for this set, the one that has Lion-O in a running pose on the cover with the rest of the thundercats in the background and two disks that are red in color on top.

You'll likely wind up with a better product than what you end up with if you buy one of the original release sets.",1313280000,,723,4.18705035971223
4469642,1,B004UOHNAW,"Amazon might be combining the reviews for the first box set releases and the newer 12 episode two disc ""set"", and if so let me make it clear that I am talking about the newest single ammaray case being released on July 12th, 2011, with Lion-O centered on a silver background cover.

A word of warning to those interested in buying this new set - it's exactly the same release as the previous season sets, only with fewer episodes!

IGN.com gave a review that stated:

""This new set runs roughly $15, but there's a serious catch - the original DVD featured 33 episodes of the show. This set contains just 12! Considering there are 65 episodes in this first season and 65 episodes in the second season, this two-disc set is ripping off consumers by charging more and offering less overall. For shame...

You might be wondering, though, is the presentation better, at least? Nope. It's a direct port of the previous set. Strike two...

If you already own ThunderCats on DVD, do not buy this double-dip. It's really just a port of the previous disc with no new material and the same A/V presentation. In fact, I can't even recommend it to newcomers. In the long run you'll spend way more on these sets than if you just broke down and bought the four-volume complete series DVD. Unless these sets wind up in a $5 bin, avoid them.""

You can still find the first release sets for sale on Amazon for $20-$25 a piece (volume 2 - Season 1 part 2 - runs considerably high at $44 at the time of this write up though).",1310169600,21,1505,4.434782608695652
