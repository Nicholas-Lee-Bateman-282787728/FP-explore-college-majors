8686886,5,B00P8E393I,"The first song on this album is Hebrews 4:12 ""The Word of God is living and active..."" and this album (and all Seeds Family Worship DVDs!) is proof of that.  It's a great way to memorize Scripture with your family.  We have 3 month old boy/girl twins and a 2 year old daughter and love watching our oldest dance and sing along while memorizing the Word.  We love that all of the albums are word for word the Word of God.  No fluff added!",1497830400,2,437,4.166666666666667
