8000878,4,B0000DF11S,"I have been following relapse records band's since neurosis signed with them in the mid 90's.  This label has consistently been a bridgeway for many great bands such as Neurosis, Mastadon, Today is The Day, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Brutal Truth amongst a few. Other bands like Amorphis and ATP are on here as well.  This dvd is a lot of material circa 1995-96 era including two videos by Neurosis (worth the low price in and of itself to me).  Many of the videos are live performance, or very cheesy home made type (parents basement, family farm), but that's what makes them entertaining.  Production value is minimal, because these bands just want to get their music out and heard.  Around 60 minutes in lenght, worth a look. I am happy relapse put recollection 1 and 2 out, and hope that they may dig through their vaults some more and release futher videos.",1219276800,2,862,4.644736842105263
