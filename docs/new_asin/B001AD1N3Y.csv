No where in description of movie was this mentioned. Dubbing is too distracting, this and the fact that the film looked cropped to fit tv made it unwatchable for me.",1476057600,,309,4.344827586206897
8276698,2,B001AD1N3Y,Anna Magnani is wonderful as always.  However the plot is dull and predictable.,1463443200,,79,5.076923076923077
8276699,1,B001AD1N3Y,"I saw this movie years ago, and it's a little masterpiece.  However, this dvd and the ""instant video"" option are both copies dubbed in English. They're not in original version, Italian with English subtitles. I was very disappointed, but I contacted the costumer service and they were very understanding and helpful. They returned my money. I feel very disappointed, because I wanted to see this movie again and have it in my library.  I hope they'll come out with another version (maybe restored and in widescreen) with English subtitles.",1356048000,,539,5.044943820224719
8276700,1,B001AD1N3Y,"I downloaded this movie because it's a little masterpiece, and when I started to watch it, it's not in Italian with English subtitles, it's dubbed in English. There was no information warning the buyer that this copy is not in Italian, and I went ahead and bought it. I'm not sure how to cancel it now. How can they sell a copy like this without warning the buyers? How can they ruin this wonderful movie by dubbing Anna Magnani's and Giuletta Masina's unique voices. I'll try to return this copy, even though it's already downloaded. I feel cheated and ver angry. If you care, do not buy this movie until they offer a copy in original version with subtitles.",1356048000,,659,4.546218487394958
