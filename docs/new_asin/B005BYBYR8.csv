8630612,3,B005BYBYR8,"Honestly, wasn't going to bother writing a review for this, but when I realized there were none as of yet, I figured I should throw something out there to guide my fellow Highlander-loving bethren.

First of all, the price of this item right now is freaking ABSURD ($30+) for what you get.  I paid $20, and even as a Highlander nut I feel a bit ripped-off.

Here's what you're getting in this package:

An awful (no seriously... TERRIBLE) short story featuring only Amanda, Joe, & Methos (literally just the three of them, not one other person, not even an extra).  It's all shot in one location, and they wax philosophical about the possibility of Methos getting married, or not.  It's just... really not worth your time at all.

Then there's the interviews.  The interviews are more worthwhile.

The interview with Jim Byrnes (Joe) is wonderful, and would probably justify a $10 pricetag for me single-handedly.  He's clearly a really cool guy, and he has a lot of interesting stories and insights regarding how his character came to be in the show and how it evolved.  This interview is far and away the best reason to buy this disc.
The interview with Peter Wingfield (Methos) is overall pretty entertaining.  It's not nearly as engaging as the Byrnes interview, but a lot of the entertainment value comes from the fact that Wingfield comes off as slightly unhinged in some of it.  At one point he prefaces a comment with the phrase ""as I tell my therapist"" (paraphrasing) in a half-joking sort of way, and the more it goes on, the more you realize he's probably not joking.  Lots of discussion about how the Methos character sort of kept living on in his mind and refused to ""die"" for him on a personal level.  So... yeah.  I was entertained.
The interview with Elizabeth Gracen (Amanda) was just sort of uninteresting to me.  I'm sure she's probably a charming person were I to actually meet her, but she's just not engaging like Byrnes is, nor does she come off as entertainingly cuckoo like Wingfield does.  She's just kind of... there, and there aren't any fascinating revelations about her character or about her.

Final verdict: If the price tag on this is $20 or less and you're an absolute Highlander NUT, I can recommend picking it up.  But for $30+?  No way.  Not for me, not for anyone.",1393977600,5,2302,4.6600496277915635
