She has been using the second video for about two weeks and I keep being impressed with her results! Our daughter is a competitive dancer (9 years old) and her weakness has always been her lack of flexibility, she has tried many things but these videos are the only things that have helped her. I highly recommend her videos!!!!",1403827200,3,486,4.534090909090909

8525593,5,B0085F92L0,"I purchased this DVD for my dance daughter after purchasing Stacey Nemour's Secret of Splits & Flexibility DVD. This DVD takes you to the next level with your splits and flexibility. My daughter's flexibility, splits, and dancing have improved because of Stacey's secrets.",1398124800,2,272,5.348837209302325
8525594,5,B0085F92L0,"I found this DVD to be incredibly helpful in stretching and getting more into a place where the splits were achievable. The careful guidance leaves you feeling like you understand what you are doing and how not to damage or hurt yourself; unlike other DVDs that leave out some critical information Stacey gives it to you. The amount of different exercises gives you enough to do that you don't feel stagnated in only two or three main exercises, plus the ability to critically go over the muscles that are needed for the stretch.  I love the energy Stacey has in giving the information out and it feels like I'm getting a private session with her. There's a lot of gold nuggets here as far as stretching into the splits and flexibility goes here. I found myself practicing daily and I saw real results quickly as I put forward effort and relaxed into the stretch. I'm glad I didn't let the previous reviewer influence me in the decision in getting this second installment of Stacey's Splits DVDs as it really had more to give than the first. Oh and that was another thing, I thought it would be for the more advanced class but it is and it isn't, there's a lot of really good information and stretches for those who are still working off the first one here too, but she does build off of the first one and show some greater stretching techniques. This DVD helped me achieve a greater stretch and reach my goal of doing the splits. I couldn't be happier when my goal was becoming a reality.",1394323200,4,1489,4.4944649446494465
8525595,1,B0085F92L0,"Purchased this for my daughter to help her get her splits. She is a teenager who needed to increase her flexibility and obtain splits for dance. She did not enjoy the video and did not think this video would help her get her splits after watching it. Did purchase another video, Ballet Boot Camp Stretch, which did help her achieve her side splits.",1388448000,2,348,4.5396825396825395
