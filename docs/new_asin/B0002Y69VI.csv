2141413,2,B0002Y69VI,"I've heard comparisons to Last House, though this does not come close to the brutality of it's predecessor.  Another irk about this film is that it is dubbed.  I would rather hear the original language track and read subtitles than watch mush-mouth over-dubbing.  Though Blue Underground has always been the benchmark of quality, they have let us down with this release, and I am a little upset over making a blind purchase on this one.  Don't believe the hype.  If you want extreme, watch Last House or I Spit On Your Grave.",1100390400,7,525,4.663043478260869
2141414,4,B0002Y69VI,"I agree that while this film borrowed heavily from Last House on the Left, Night Train Murders is the better of the two.  Good production values, excellent cinematography, an Ennio Morricone score, decent acting and a tight script, set Night Train Murders above Last House and other films of this type.  The first third of the film introduces the main characters and then gets them on a train (the night before Christmas) that is full of odd, quirky travelers - most of whom seem to be prone to indulging in one perversion or another. The ""defilement"" section of the film is a gripping, harrowing affair that escalates in viciousness before climaxing in a very brutal fashion. The final act does not live up to the scenes that precede it.  While there is another escalation towards a violent outcome, the plot seems to falter in a couple of spots, and the eventual retribution seems tame in comparison to the acts which have ignited it.  The character who gets revenge is a surgeon, and when we first see him he is cutting into people (using what looks like real footage) so I was expecting a truly grisly and horrific conclusion. However,  the director's desire to keep from glamorizing violence is probably why the ending feels somewhat restrained.  As for the DVD itself, the image is pristine throughout most of the film, the sound quality is good and extras include an interesting interview with the director.  However, one problem I have with the presentation is that the original Italian audio track with English subtitles is not an option,  only an English dub is available.  Still, this is another great release from Blue Underground and definitely a film which deserves a larger audience.",1100131200,35,1698,4.8477508650519034
2141415,4,B0002Y69VI,"First off, I am a fan of Italian horror films of the 70's and 80's. I had always wanted to see Night Train Murders, but it was never released in the United States making it nearly impossible to view. Instead of buying a bootleg, which I thought about on several occasions, I waited for its official release. After receiving my DVD, I was pleasently surprised by how good the film was. Like most Italian flicks, they ""rip-off"" or ""borrow"" ideas from American films. Zombie borrowed from Dawn of the Dead, The Beyond borrowed from The Shining, Conquest borrowed from Conan the Barbarian, and Night Train Murders borrows from Last House on The Left. So much in fact that it was released as Second House on the Left, New House on the Left, and Last Stop on the Night Train in other parts of the world. Many of the story elements are borrowed from Craven's film debut, including characters and situations. Even though it freely borrowed from Craven's film, I actually came out liking this film better. First of all it has higher production values so the filmmakers were able to heighten the cinematography, and other such aspects. I also liked how Night Train Murders was more disturbing and gritty. There were no awkward comedy moments like the ones present during Last House. There is more character development so you learn to like the two leading actresses more. In turn, since you like them better, you hate the goons more for the violoations they did to them. The director inserts a lot of flair and style while making a truely likeable revenge/exploitation epic that finally gets its just release in the United States. I've been waiting a long time for this film and I greatly thank Blue Underground for releasing a this steller DVD. The picture absolutely looks wonderful and the extra features were great. For fans of Italian horror, this DVD will not disappoint!",1099008000,58,1867,4.765432098765432
2141506,4,B0002Y69VI,"Yes, yes, yes, it's a Last House On The Left ripoff through and through, but the action here takes place on a train-The Night Train!!
This time out, the two unfortunate females are on a train to Italy.  Also on board are two doofus thugs(one of them is Flavio Bucci, who was the blind piano player in Suspiria). If it would have been just the two thugs, some mischief, vandalism, and all around A-Hole-ism might have been about the extent of it, but that's where the rich lady comes in.  The rich lady, played by Macha Meri(the psychic from Deep Red), comes across as a snooty upper class wench, but we can guess by some sexy pictures that fall out of her travel bag, that there is more to her than meets the eye....kinda like The Transformers.  After a sexual encounter with Doofus Thug #1(Flavio) in the train pissoir(which begins as an attempted rape), the rich lady takes the opportunity to use the two thugs as a means to cut loose(footloose) and live out her wacky sex fantasies.  This also brings out the worst in the two thugs who become much more dangerous and threatening than they originally came across as being.
Our two female friends become the target of this unholy trio as they force their way into the girls' train car and proceed to degrade and sexually assault them, eventually ending in their deaths(don't accuse me of spoilers, you knew that was gonna happen! This is a Last House On The Left ripoff, remember?).  One particularly sleazy moment has a fellow passenger on the train witnessing the horrors going on inside the train car, and instead of stopping it or reporting it, he joins in just long enough to rape one of the girls!  Good Golly Miss Molly!
Of course, in our Last House tradition, these three clowns end up in the clutches of the parents of one of the girls.  Well, you know what happens then.
This movie is certainly sleazy and mean spirited, though not as graphically violent as it's reputation would have you believe.  It has it's moments though.  You get to know the female victims a bit better here than you did in Last House, but Last House's ace in the hole was David Hess, who was more imposing and sinister than the three villains here combined.
In the end, it's another exceptional piece of Italian exploitation sleaze.  Dig in.",1361491200,,2276,4.583743842364532
2141507,3,B0002Y69VI,"A pair of murdering thieves hitch a ride on the night train to Italy, where they torture, rape, and kill two young girls who are on their way home for Christmas. It's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT... on a train. Director Aldo Lado only looks to shock and disgust with this exploitation flick that quickly cashes in on the notoriety of Craven's film. What comes as a surprise is that the cinematography and acting are actually quite good, which is even more disturbing considering that the nastiness of the film has been carefully planned and executed unlike the guerilla shooting style found in LAST HOUSE. While the characters are plainly drawn, their actions and dialog are very tight-knit, which keeps the pace moving along at a rapid pace. Flavio Bucci and Gianfranco De Grassi, who play the villainous Blackie and Curly, are frighteningly realistic and believable as common street hoods. They are not overdrawn and exaggerated like Krug and the gang. The bone-chilling tune that Curly plays on his harmonica gives a foreboding sense of danger leading up to their attack on the two girls. It is hard not to turn away from the disgusting acts of depravity that occur on board, but Lado elicits the anger and hatred he needs to fuel the final act, where the murderers accidentally arrive at the house of the girls' vengeful parents. Though lacking the impact and historical significance that LAST HOUSE carries with it, NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS is one of the better imitators that came in the years following its release.

2141508,5,B0002Y69VI,The DVD arrived very quickly. I enjoyed the movie a lot.  It is an older movie from the 1970s and was great!  Thanks.,1330819200,,117,4.043478260869565
2141509,3,B0002Y69VI,"Let me start by saying that I am trying to watch all the most infamous/controversial movies of all time so that I can write a book about them.  This particular movie, while showing above and beyond what might be shown in a typical movie, does not come close to measuring up to any of the really extreme movies of its genre like ""The Last House on the Left,"" ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" ""Red to Kill,"" etc.  ""Night Train Murders"" is a story of two women who take a train through Europe and are attacked by four of their fellow passengers.  None of the characters come across as being particularly intelligent nor is it possible to really have empathy for any of them since you can't identify with the characters well.

As far as being an extreme film, ""Night Train Murders"" falls short in my opinion.  It does have some scenes that would be very unappealing to most audiences, but they are done with terrible special effects, even for the time the movie was made (1975). There also aren't very many of these scenes and they are quite short.

An additional issue with this movie is the quality of the DVD.  The copy I bought wouldn't work in computers.  It would only work in an actual DVD player.  Most movies I watch will work in both, but this one would not.  I tried it on multiple computers, and it wouldn't work in any of them!",1273449600,,1327,4.3795918367346935
2141510,4,B0002Y69VI,"Despite a very disjointed start (in very poor quality - almost looks 16mm) the story comes together and all hell is let loose.  Well acted, often edge of your seat situations - some of which are pretty disturbing,  the film moves along at a brisk pace - perhaps too brisk as the clues leading up to the climactic confrontation are too rushed and justice dealt out too swiftly - though that's the only real fault I can find in an otherwise great film.

Transfer quality is rough at the start as I mentioned but soon becomes satisfactory if not pretty good maybe due to different film stocks used.",1267056000,,595,4.4907407407407405
2141511,4,B0002Y69VI,"Night Train Murders follows the same basic set-up as The Last House on the Left. Two girls are kidnapped by thugs, tortured, raped, and then brutally murdered, and then their parents find out and exact bloody revenge. The setting this time is in Italy, and the plot follows two girls on a series of train rides to one of their parents house. The film starts off much like a film about two innocent tourists. The girls get on the train and have a series of little adventures, not entirely innocent, but innocent and without much fear. However, as their train rides continue, things don't go as planned. Two thugs sneak on board and begin to harass the girls, as well as another female passenger who soon decides to join them on their night of debauchery and mayhem after one of them rapes her.

When the two girls find themselves fearing for their lives and uncomfortable, they take advantage of a somewhat convenient bomb-threat and sneak onboard another train that will get them to their destination about half an hour early. They get on-board only to find that the train is, mostly, deserted and seemingly without lights or electricity. They take a nap in one of the compartments and then wake up later on in the night to have dinner by candlelight. However, during their dinner they soon discover that the thugs, along with their female friend, have sneaked on-board and the two girls find themselves trapped in a horrible nightmare of torture, rape, humiliation, and heartless cruelty.

When the deeds are done the terror still continues. Even after the bodies are violated and disposed of there is still such incredible suspense in it's unfolding of events. When the parents show up to pick the girls up and find the two thugs and the girl at the train station instead, we can feel the slowly building paranoia as the characters realize who they are each dealing with. As the parents come to find out what happened, we truly can feel their sorrow as they realize that they will never see their daughter alive again. Then the revenge aspect comes into play and it is even more shocking than we anticipated. It is not shocking in a gratuitous gorefest kind of sense, but rather it is shocking in that it is obvious that the father who performs these killings is unprepared and inexperienced in such matters. The terror comes from the fact that he is a normal man who is doing something he has never wanted to do. As a result the film is not only horrifying, but it is also an emotional roller coaster ride.

This is one of the most effective horror films I have ever seen. The realism of the situations presented here comes off so authentic and suspenseful that it's practically a guarantee that most viewers' stomachs will be in knots. The film is relentless in it's horror and the way the victims' lives are toyed with. The audience is toyed with as well in several moments of what I could pretty much describe as false hope. The film will likely take an emotional tole on viewers who aren't prepared. This film is far more disturbing than The Last House on the Left due to the unfolding tension. There are no moments of forced dark comedy or cheap style. The film pulls no punches in depicting the last hours of the lives of these two innocent girls. The character of Curly is also far more terrifying than the character of Krug in the original in that he comes across as so simple-minded and yet so screwed up in a realistic way. This is an absolute must-see for all horror fans. This film is a masterpiece, and I'm glad that a modern day version of The Virgin Spring has finally been told in a proper and effective way.",1266537600,4,3627,4.585516178736517
2141512,3,B0002Y69VI,"People say that this movie is ""more graphic"" than ""The Last House On The Left"" No. This movie is knowhere near as bad as that movie.
 Made in 75' Its the story of two teenage girls that travel through Europe on a train. While they are on the train this group makes the girls do sexual things to them. SPOILER HERE. The group ends up killing the two girls in the end.
 I don't think this movie is sexuely graphic. If you are Looking for a graphic rape type movie look for ""I Spit On Your Grave"" ""Last House On The Left"" or ""Trip With The Teacher."" Dont get me wrong its not a bad movie just not real great. If you can find it cheap. Pick it up at amazon.",1265587200,,653,3.9770992366412212
2141513,3,B0002Y69VI,"I purchased this film thinking it would be much like last house on the left except on a train, and it was. The biggest dissapointment about it though is that its not as gory and the few killings there are in the film just aren't brutal.

2141514,4,B0002Y69VI,"I know this movie was inspired by the Last House on the Left, but there is really no comparison. This is the far better movie.  Macha Meril plays a fantastic villian. The acting here is excellent, where in Last House, it was pretty bad all throughout the first half of the movie.  The director sets a good tone of appropriate creepiness. The train setting is fantastic, because it gives you a feeling of claustrophobia, there is just no place to go!  There is a theme of the ""rich taking advantage of the poor to serve their evil needs and getting away with it"", and it makes things even more interesting. I think this movie worked better than Last House because it builds a feeling of dread, without the absurd attempts at ""comic relief"". The revenge aspect wasn't quite as satisfying, but it is more realistic.",1197244800,2,812,4.586206896551724
2141555,4,B0002Y69VI,"Night Train Murders is often called Last House on the Left on a train and make no mistake it's fairly obvious where Night Train Murders got its idea from. It's pretty much the same exact movie at times only difference is set on a train. Basically if you have seen Last House on the Left you pretty much know how this movie will turn out.

Night Train Murders has a lot going for it though; for starters unlike the movie it knocked off there is no comedy here. It's a straight forward movie with no happy ending.

The script by Renato Izzo & Aldo Lado lacks in the character development, but despite that they are able to create real characters as well as make some political statements. Aldo Lado also directs and does a fine job at the pacing of the movie; the first half of the movie is rather slow. Not a whole lot happens as we follow the two teenage girls who despite depth come across as real and likeable people.

Some people might find the first half boring and in many ways I understand why. But despite the slowness I still quite enjoyed it. I liked the two main characters and that helped keep my interest. The scenes with the parents early on are also well done and like the two girls the parents lack depth, but come across as real people.

Night Train Murders does start to get a little boring right before the villains attack the two girls. But it's only a matter of minutes before the movie picks up again.  The torture scenes on the train are actually rather tame compared to most movies like this. Though the razor blade scene easily has to rate as one of the most twisted scenes ever; besides that scene while there are some shocking moments and the torture scenes are unpleasant Night Train Murders is though very tame compared too many movies with this style.

The train scenes during the attack are very well done; first off it's well shot and beautifully lit. The blue lighting used really is amazing and adds to the tension. The girls are stuck with these terrible people and you feel as if you are stuck with them as well. Anything that might be lacking in those scenes is made up for with the feel of claustrophobia.

The villains are pretty much a poor mans version of the villains from Last House on the Left, Flavio Bucci as Blackie even has a resemblance to David Hess. Despite that the villains work well for the most part and are very unlikable. In movies like this even when the villains pay for their crimes there is no happy ending due to what came before. But Night Train Murders while offers nothing really different to this genre doesn't have your typical ending.

Like in real life not everybody pays for their crimes and while there is revenge in Night Train Murders not everybody gets what's coming to them. While it's some what disappointing it also keeps the movie a little more real. The two thugs are worthless vile people who truly get what they deserve, but I thought the most interesting part was the fact the Lady on the Train played by Macha Meril was probably the most sadistic.

The lower class will often pay for their crimes, which they should; but many times the upper class even if more ruthless a lot of the times get away with what they have done. Some of these aspects help keep Night Train Murders feel very real. The revenge scenes were solid, but they could have maybe lasted a little longer. They are too quick, but at the same time get the job done.

While Night Train Murders may not be the best this genre has to offer and the torture scenes are tame compared to other movies like this, it still works well and is rather unpleasant to watch. Even when the movie ends you still feel a bit down due to what came before it. For those looking for something hardcore you won't find it here, but Night Train Murders is quite well done in my opinion.",1183939200,7,3809,4.413105413105413
2141556,3,B0002Y69VI,"Italian cinema in the 1970's, the home of cheap imitations and ruthless money obsessed producers whose last concern was the creative or artistic endeavours of their directors. Despite the mercenary capitalism of Italian film production, a few genre films of note drifted out of the mediocrity. Aldo Lado's 1975 effort ""The Night Train Murders"" lies in that perilous middle ground between an interesting film with some value and a shameless rip off, of in this case, Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"". From a narrative point of view the films are identical and so is the rather feeble moral message about violence and the society that breeds it. Naturally the sadistic sexual violence is deeply unpleasant and its impact is increased by Ennio Morricone's Spartan and uncharacteristically minimalist soundtrack (excluding the truly awful Demis Roussos theme song). This brutality left me rather hollow and empty. However Lado's does have cultural value. It builds on a concern present in many Lado films, which is the uncompromising exploitation of a younger permissive generation by a bored, apathetic and dangerously decadent bourgeoisie. What gives this film added virulence is that the bourgeious is represented by an astonishingly sadistic woman. She plays the young thugs like mindless puppets as they act out her darkest and sickest fantasies. The films conclusion punishes the young thugs with death, but the female sadist survives which implicitly suggests that bourgeious exploitation will continue. The same message can be found in Lado's superior giallo ""Short Night of Glass Dolls"". The film is made with polish and style by Lado, who is an accomplished director, he eschews the rough and ready cinema verite approach of Craven, to produce a uniquely European take on this revenge tale. However this doesn't excuse the film or the sour taste it leaves in the mouth.",1169251200,,1880,5.228476821192053

I rented this thinking it was going to be just another slasher movie, but imagine my surprise when a few minutes into the movie I realized that the director, Aldo Lado, actually had some talent and shot a film that was not only engaging, but quite beautiful.

I won't ruin the movie by giving away a bunch of spoilers but lets just say two girls on the way home for Christmas have a bad (to say the least) encounter with two petty thieves who are unknowningly being manipulated by a rich (and ultra-seductive) female passenger played by Macha Meril, who was in Bunuel's erotic masterpiece BELLE DE JOUR.

some of the others, it's a very cheap and pathetic attempt.

The overall picture that takes place on the train is too grainy and dark too watch. The acting I would call average. The girls in this movie, we'll you feel sorry for them but they don't deliver any surprises in this. Like ""Last House on the Left""

and other flicks, you know their going to die. They actually do have a chance to escape and there's even some bumbly old geezer that catches the disgraceful pedophiles in action but he does nothing, in fact he tries to join in!!!!

2141563,4,B0002Y69VI,Firstly this film does copy the Last House on the Left but to be fair Last House is a remake of an earlier Ingrid Bergmann film called the virgin spring and not in itself an original. I think this film is a far more powerful animal.  The direction is excellent and the cinemaphotography really captures how alone on a busy train you can be.  The scene in the carriage is disturbing and very uncomfortable to watch and in my opinion delivers.  The performance of Macha Meril is particularly sleazy and reinforces the class issues the film is dealing with.  The two young thugs are reprehensible in their actions but it is the middle class woman who is calling the shots and  directing them in their heinous acts.  Good performances all round excellent transfer and letterbox.  Extras round out the disc with a good interview with Aldo Lado.

8034587,4,B0002Y69VI,"NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS (aka: LAST STOP ON THE NIGHT TRAIN- 1975) opens w/ a scene of two men robbing Santa Claus, while godawful theme music plays. No, honestly, this song is terrible, featuring vocals that can only be described as sounding like someone getting themselves stuck in the zipper of their jeans! The scene switches to two young women, named Margaret and Laura (Irene Miracle and Marina Berti), getting ready for the fateful trip -from Germany to Italy- of the title. Uh oh! Those two creeps / Santa robbers, on the run from the cops, jump on board the same train as the girls! This can't be good. Some humorous things occur, as we are introduced to some of the other passengers, and their quirks. Margaret and Laura get settled in, while the two miscreants, named Blackie and Curly (Flavio Bucci and Gianfranco De Grassi), roam about the train, antagonizing people. Soon, their antics take a serious turn, hinting at violence to come. Blackie and Curly hook up w/ a rather odd woman (Macha Meril) who is like gasoline to their fire. The three of them take sadistic, sexual advantage of Margaret and Laura, becoming a trio of terror. While the two thugs are indeed repellent, Meril's character is more sinister, since she is the instigator, and is so gleeful about the whole mess, no matter how tragic it becomes. This is inter-cut w/ scenes of a Christmas dinner-party at Laura's parents house. Yes, this movie does have a lot in common w/ LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. The main characters, the situation, the insane, disgusting action / atmosphere, and the finale, are all similar. The addition of a voyeur-turned-rapist certainly adds to the ick factor. I prefer this movie to Craven's, mostly because it's more polished, and has more depth. I realize that others enjoy the grimy, dirty look and feel of LHOTL, but I'm just not a big fan. Also, I HATE rape scenes, and they're shorter here. Oh, and the ending is just plain better in this film.
