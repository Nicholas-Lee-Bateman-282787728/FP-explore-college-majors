1647878,3,B00005QCX7,"For those who have wanted to fly since childhood this film brings back memories.  Yes, it's somewhat corny plot-wise, but the flying is authentic and real.  The flying scenes are beautiful.  The characters are wholesome and a bit unreal in many ways, but to someone who dislikes Hollywood and such, they were refreshing.  Talented?  I suspect the script as such didn't allow real talent to come out.  This is a documentary.  The flying scenes are the big thing in this movie made for iMax theaters, the plot is second fiddle.  I wish I could see it on an iMax screen.  I say THANKS to the producers and actors for making a film for those of us who wanted so badly to fly as kids.  For me, like Zac, the dream has come true.

1647879,3,B00005QCX7,"Gladly, I did not purchase this DVD.  It was given to me for free when I ordered the fantastic Virtual FX 3D System from edimensional.com.  As for the movie, the story is totally predictable and a bit cheesy at times.  The kid in the beginning isn't all that smart.  Sure, he is inventive, but doesn't do any proper research into the mechanics of flight until his dad takes interest.  Plus, his parents do not get involved with the kid's interests until he starts performing crazy stunts.  Wouldn't you think they'd be with him in his aerial dreams from the start?  His inventions remind me of the suicidal inventions created by the first people trying to achieve flight.  The bicycle-crappy hang glider combination the boy makes would not have glided like it does in the film.  His weight and that of the bike would have dropped the contraption right to the ground after going off the ramp.  I also have to wonder why Canadian flyers are down in Arizona doing Operation Red Flag style dogfights over Lake Powell and the Grand Canyon.  How come they are not up in Canada?

Other than the story, which needs serious tweaking, the 3D depth effects are great.  Of course, I must tout the Virtual FX 3D System again, because you can now achieve nearly identical results with any 2D source, like TV shows and any movies on DVD or video.  But, since the IMAX film was literally filmed in 3D, the effects are much more pronounced.  The inner cockpit views of the pilots during the flight scenes are poorly done though.  Sure, they're in 3D, but are clearly staged instead of actual in-flight views of real pilots.

On the whole, the movie is worthy of having if you desire to increase your field sequential 3D film collection, just don't expect a highly engaging and emotional experience with the story.",1140739200,2,1796,4.650793650793651

Those guys must have watched this while under the influence of some mind-altering substance, like alcohol or caffeine. Yes the flying bits are good and the 3D not bad for those parts, but creating a very bad story just to put a kid in a plane doesn't make for a good movie.",1393372800,,347,4.1940298507462686

1647887,1,B00005QCX7,"I do not own many 3D movies yet, but this one is at the lowest of the list based on quality. The story line is horrible as well. I was hoping to get some cool airplane views. Had a few, but not as much as I was looking for. Save your money on this one!",1366243200,,252,3.6

1647893,1,B00005QCX7,"I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids, a boy and girl. He dreams of flight, she is a natural engineer. Later in life they are best friends but deal with a military pilot trying to steal her heart. The acting is poor. The photography is mostly amazing.

Some of the scenes shot over Lake Powell become tedious with endless stalls and boring close-ups of people in the cockpit. There is very little of what is featured in the case/cover photograph. If you're looking for a Blue Angels in 3D type video, this is not for you. If you're looking for non-actors with lots of actor close-ups generally filmed in 3D than this might be the ticket.

I would have rather seen a best-of at Oshkosh in 3D instead. I wish I had never purchased this 'movie.'",1325548800,,900,4.351190476190476
1647894,1,B00005QCX7,"This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful, but it falls short. Most of the 3D effect has ghosting throughout most of the video. Its like everything is out of focus. Also, the plot is silly and pointless. Save your money.",1322697600,2,228,4.4523809523809526
1647895,2,B00005QCX7,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

This review is for the 3D blu-ray version - The old 2001 Slingshot 3D DVD for picture tube TVs was actually better.

Like many of the IMAX films the 3D is over done. In this film it is just too big of a difference in the right and left views (excess parallax). More sensitive people may feel eye strain or get headaches from watching this movie. The excess may even cause some ghosting on active glasses systems.

I counted 4 out of screen effects. There are 2 out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. One at 20% and 1 at 25%.

If the 3D in other IMAX films were OK for you, this one might be.

MY 3D RATING = FAIR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

Oh, and the surround sound is top notch too, but IMAX movies have been good at that. A plus it that it is something the kids will enjoy (and is G rated).",1301702400,8,452,4.206896551724138

7950267,3,B00005QCX7,"First and foremost I do NOT give any spoilers on any of my movie reviews, period!
I will keep this short and to the point. This film, as I will call it, as it really isn't a movie per say. Was just OK. The scripting was mediocre at best. The acting was a bit 2nd or 3rd rate. The storyline flowed along at a sluggish pace and all in all I was not impressed what so ever. However, the 3D in this film was fair and worthy of a glance. Maybe it helped that I am into aircraft with a passion that doesn't stop. I found that the film had a few moments where the 3D was overdone, which caused ghosting with my active glasses. The depth of some of the 3D shots were really good though. I will however give it a weak 3 star, really should be 2 but then that would mean I just didn't like it at all. And well, there were 'moments' I did. -- LOVE me some planes :) LOL
PS - I am a private pilot and an RC pilot enthusiast so it automatically earned 1 star for that.

CONCLUSION --
All in all I do not think I would buy this again, and instead I would look elsewhere to spend my money on a better 3D movie and or film.",1491177600,,1107,3.8552631578947367

7950269,2,B00005QCX7,"Out of all the titles that comprise the recent batch of Image
IMAX releases, I had the highest expectations for Ultimate
G's: Zac's Flying Dream.  I mean, you take one look at the
cover and feel your heart race looking at the cool pictures
of monoplanes racing across the sky.  Then, you look at
the label on the corner and see that Michael Cera is involved
with the project.  How cool this must be!

The first disappointment comes when you find out that
Ultimate G's is a film originally produced in 2000 for
Imax exhibition.  It features a 12 year-old Michael Cera
who dominates the first half of this short as a young
boy named Zac whose dreams of flight leads him to
building all sorts of flying machines with the help
of his friend Laura.  Sixteen years later, Zac has become
the pilot he has always dreamed to be, and upon visiting
his long-time childhood friend, Laura, he is challenged to
an aerobatic dual by a hotshot pilot.

What does all this have to do with cool 3D flight?
Absolutely nothing other than grounding this movie
firmly for most of its length with a badly written,
hokey storyline that throws in a sappy love story
that is so bad you would think it was written by
George Lucas.

It seemingly takes forever for viewers go get through
the film's opening story of the young Zac (Michael Cera)
and his many attempts to build the perfect flying machine.
It is only 17 minutes later that we get our first taste of
actual flight footage, but that is quickly replaced with a
more tedious storyline concerning two rivals trying to
impress a girl that leads to an aerobic duel high above
the Grand Canyon.

With a camera placed in the front seat of an Extra 300
monoplane, there is some breathtaking aerial footage
from above Lake Powell and The Grand Canyon.  The
stunning photography holds up to the standards of what
you would expect from an IMAX presentation.  Unfortunately,
I would estimate that there is about 10-15 minutes of actual
flight footage within this 37 minute feature.

The transfer is sharp and well detailed.  That's the good
news. The 3D looks....well....okay.  Certainly, the Grand
Canyon sequences with its striking rock formations and
colors benefit most from the added dimensionality as the
overhead shots of Lake Powell.  While there is distinct
foreground and background separation, most of it has
no benefit to the viewer when most of the film takes place
indoors --- whether it be in Zac's bedroom, garage workshop
or a nearby bar.  Most all these scenes lean towards being
dark, and thus, I found a considerable amount of ghosting
present.  In fact, I found image doubling was a consistent
problem on this disc.  Even some of the flight sequences
that take place in broad daylight exhibit ghosting around
the edges of the monoplane wings.  There is absolutely
no ""In Yo' Face"" 3D to be seen here.

The best thing that I can say about the overall presentation
is that it sports a full-bodied, triumphant musical soundtrack
with very active surrounds.  The entire film sounds immensely
epic with its sweeping music enhanced by the sound of planes
that roar from the rears across the front.  An overabundance
of effect noise keep the back channels competing for attention.

Perhaps most of the blame for the flaws in this IMAX
presentation is due to the time period it was created.
Back in 2000 (only 11 years ago), 3D was technology
that was limited to IMAX screens and people who went
to see these films cared less about the content of what
they were watching as long as it showed off a certain
amount of intriguing 3D footage.

These days, I think audiences are demanding much
more than what Ultimate G's Zac's Flying Dream can
offer. Personally I would be quite mad if I had just
plopped down $15 for this Blu-ray and ended up sitting
through the cornfed storytelling with a hint of mildly
satisfying 3D footage.",1453075200,,3858,4.681481481481481
