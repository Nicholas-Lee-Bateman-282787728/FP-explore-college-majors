8188911,5,B000P4U3EO,"This set of Monty Python TV episodes is particularly silly - it contains episodes 17, 18 and 19, all from Season 2 of Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Episode 17 starts with a butterfly Gillimation to opening sequence, silly Masonic handshakes, curing masonism, Gumbys, Mr Devius' insurance with nude lady. ""In your claim it states clearly that any claim you make will not be paid."" Church of England action series ""The Bishop"" with hard-boiled intro, very hardboiled, and someone is killing the vicars of England. A poet in every home. Talk show with a bishop and a nude man. Five apologies. A Gillimation of men bouncing on fat women. After shave from fish, forbidden words - Semprini. ""Anything you say will be ignored."" Mad cop!

Episode 18 features the amazing blackmail game show, ""Stop The Film"" with its insane flickering, society board meeting. ""Meeting adjourned forever."" Walk into a Gillimation. Hapless guest in collapsing room who accidentally commits two murders, ha ha, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers pointless skit of a useless school play (six brothers, two brides actually), a meat Gillimation, 50% rude butcher, brainless boxer training for a match against a schoolgirl in a robin's blue dress.

Episode 19 starts off with the confusing ""It's A Living"" show, then a Gillimation in the dark. Crazy awards banquet with battle at end, segues via a TV to a talk show on filmmaking. Police prizes to samurai Gillimation, Michalangelo's Adam sandwich. Mr Raymond Luxury-Yacht. Fake nose. Train Gillimation. Man's marriage, Gillimation shows a black spot that seeks its fortune in the city. Election Night Special - normal versus silly candidates (versus very very very very silly candidates). Yay!! The Pythons sure loved long names!!

It comes with plenty of bonus materials in its ""Loony Bin"" section - each episode has in its own menu a ""useless tidbit"", which is typically some sort of trivia item; can be ignored. It has a new ""Meet The Chaps"" menu from Season 1, this one has Graham Chapman doing ""Biggles dictates a letter"" (0:24), Eric Idle in ""The Money Programme sketch"" (0L39), Terry Jones doing ""Crunchy Frog"" (0:17), John Cleese in the ""Minister of Silly Walks"" (0:36), Michael Palin ""Blackmail sketch"" (0:29), and Terry Gilliam doing the ""poetry reading sketch"" reading ""Ozymandias"" (0:31).

That is followed by a trivia set of ""Trivia for Gumbys"" and ""Trivia for Upper-Class Twits"", full of little surprises, Gilliam's Attic with four behind-the-scenes shots. Curiously, this disc doesn't seem to have any live sketches; instead, it has two thematic skit sections, ""Monty Queries"" (two skits, each on a game show theme), and ""Tutor Manners"" (4 skits).",1453334400,,2679,5.135321100917431
