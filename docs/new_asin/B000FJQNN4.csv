8123735,5,B000FJQNN4,"If you've been interested in spring back binding, this dvd can help to clarify the process. There are some steps that are glossed over, some perhaps missed, but in general this is a wonderful look at a master bookbinder in process. The main thing I took away was that it's not as complex as it may seem to create an account book. We'll see how I feel after I tackle his technique. I can heartily recommend this dvd for anyone seeking some help in creating a spring back bound book.",1404259200,,481,4.355555555555555
8123736,5,B000FJQNN4,I have done county record bookbinding for about 20 years and while this video is focused on the restoration of an old style lay flat binding the diffrences between the information shown in the video and the way that a current county record book is bound is minor. This is a very condensed explination of the lay flat binding style and very informative. If someone wanted to produce the current style of record binding additional techniques would still need to be learned from a skilled record binder (blank book binder) and additional equipment would be needed. Overall the video is much clearer and more informative than many of the written accounts of how tis style binding is done. A great reference.,1356652800,,703,4.818181818181818

8123738,5,B000FJQNN4,"This was a real pleasure to watch, but I agree with the previous reviewer that you pretty much need to know how to bind a rounded back book for this video to be clear.

Not to say the beginner can't get anything from it but you'll get much more if understand the basics and can focus on this very interesting structure instead of wondering what a nipping press is.

But for the intermediate to advanced binder this video is a pleasure. Clear instructions & some very good tips for a professional finish.

The gold tooling is only shown in a montage because the purpose of this video is teach the binding structure only. He assumes that you know when to use PVA and when to use paste, even if he tells you what he is doing.

And what a great structure- very sturdy and not too complex (of course he makes it look very easy).

I think this is a great instructional video for the intermediate and onwards hand bookbinder.",1241827200,,918,4.376470588235295
8123739,5,B000FJQNN4,"What I loved about the DVD...I felt like I was right in the studio with Mr. Goodwin. That he was talking to me and I was getting a personal demonstration of how to do the binding. I loved that it wasn't setup or rehearsed. It was fun to see him root around his messy desk for tools (like I do) and have lunch or a cup of coffee while waiting for things to dry.

I had read an online springback tutorial but still had a few questions about things that weren't quite clear to me. I am one of those folks who has to see it being done or have the procedure worked out in my head before I start.  After watching the DVD I would feel very comfortable tackling a springback binding. I am excited as I also picked up a few new binding tricks from the film.

Is this a DVD I would reccommend for beginners? It's def. not a tutorial for someone that has never bound a book before. There are parts that are skipped or gone over quickly as some familiarity with bookbinding on the part of the watcher is assumed. That doesn't mean that a beginner shouldn't purchase the DVD as it is def. worth watching even if you are new to binding as each step is clearly demonstrated and will be more understandable as you get some basic bookbinding skills and knowledge under your belt.

For those of you who have been itching to try your hand at making a springback book and are looking for a good basic tutorial I reccommend this tutorial as it will def. demystify the process for you and it's a great value for the money.",1178323200,3,1500,4.2160278745644595
