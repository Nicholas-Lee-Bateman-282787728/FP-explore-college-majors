8461118,5,B0057SFEK6,Video came on time. Bought it for my father-in-law who served in the 23rd infantry stationed at Coang Tri. He was very impressed with the video. He couldn't stop talking throughout as he described everything to us. Thank you for preserving our military history!,1420848000,2,261,4.954545454545454
