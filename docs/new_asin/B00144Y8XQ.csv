This is not only fun but it is a challenging workout. I woke up this morning and my lower abdominals are actually sore! I have not found anything else that really gets my lower abs engaged. I am pleased with this product and would by more instructional dvds from Michelle Joyce.",1229299200,6,446,4.451219512195122
3123147,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I have purchased my fair share of mediocre to awful belly dance workout videos.  After viewing Body By Bellydance I can see that Michelle has clearly put some thought into the making of this video.

I study belly dance...and I love it so much, I rarely feel like doing any other physical activities so I am drawn to DVD's that use belly dance movements for exercise.  Many of the movements presented in this video are great for improving core strength, flexibility, cardiovascular etc. I must say I found some of the quadricep, abdominal and undulation work towards the end extremely challenging. This indicates to me that there is a lot of room for improvement in my own belly dance journey. But I find that inspiring, and it only pushes me to work even harder than before!

Even if you aren't a belly dancer, but are looking for a new type of exercise, this DVD has a very good introduction to belly dance technique.  Michelle has included a section where she clearly breaks down each movement, so it's a lot easier to pick up.  Unlike other belly dance workout DVDs I have where the instructor makes the assumption that everyone watching this DVD is going to execute and understand these movements without any clear explanation.

When I put on this DVD I feel like I am spending time with a good friend.  Like her other DVD's, Michelle has a sweet, encouraging and super friendly personality that makes me want to work hard, but have fun at the same time!",1213056000,16,1458,4.624031007751938
3123148,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I really liked the ""Perfect Hips"" DVD, but I LOVE this one!

The warmup itself is a good ""get yourself moving"" segment, that even if you didn't have time to do the rest of the exercise sections, it would still loosen you up for your day.

The breakdown of the different types of workouts is excellent. You can tailor your workout to how much time you have, whether you follow the entire DVD, or just a couple of the sections. Michelle explains and breaks down the moves very well for beginners, and a good refresher for people that have been at it for a while.

Most challenging things for me on this DVD were the floor work and abs sections. Definitely some areas there that I can see where I need to improve my strength. Couple times I found myself wanting to scream... ""AH, Michelle! You SADIST!"" but that just shows me that I need to keep at it.

Funny thing, I gave ""Perfect Hips"" a 4 star review, and gave my nitpicky reasons why. It seems Michelle must have read it, because those things were addressed in this DVD.

As with all workout DVDs... I recommend paying attention to how your body reacts to the moves. I'm in a lot better shape now than I was a year ago, and I still found things I needed to modify for my level of fitness.",1211068800,32,1240,4.282051282051282
3123149,5,B00144Y8XQ,"Body by Bellydance is a fantastic follow up to Michelle's first workout dvd, Perfect Hips! This dvd not only provides a terrific workout for ""problem areas"", it also reinforces the basics of bellydance that she introduced us to on its worthy predecessor.

Body by Bellydance is not another one of those intimidating, ""why did I even try this?"" workout dvds that will end up gathering dust on a shelf or being donated to a thrift shop. It is a truly enjoyable, fun to do, belly dance based workout that will make you feel fit and, most of all, feminine. And, while this workout may be a little challenging in spots, even if you are completely out of shape you can always modify or skip certain moves until you are ready to tackle them.

Again, Michelle's friendly, warm personality comes through in this production making the dvd even more fun to use. When I work with Michelle's dvds (and I have them all!), I feel like I am getting a one on one lesson with a friend who is there to gently encourage me to do my best. I will be forever grateful that Michelle never resorts to those aggravating phrases that you so often hear on fitness/workout dvds. I swear I will scream if I hear ""C'mon you can do it! Oh, wow, you're doing great"" from an instructor who can't even see me to know whether or not I'm doing great or I've passed out on the floor...

Anyone who is more than bored with the standard fare of workout dvds on the market today will find Body by Bellydance a real breath of fresh air. Thanks once again Michelle for giving us another absolute, must have dvd for our bellydance (and fitness) collections!!!",1210377600,12,1615,4.467796610169492
3123150,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I have bought all of Michelle's DVD and I have never been disappointed.  Her persona on camera is excellent and she is an encouraging and educated teacher.

In the past I have been disappointed with ""belly dance workout"" DVDs because  the actual workout is so mild and the instructors usually aren't that skilled in the dance.  Michelle is a personal trainer, so she knows what a workout it.  I really like that she does some belly dance instruction, but then the takes the moves and changes it up so that you aren't doing classic belly dance.  She does all sorts of different variations of the moves that is designed to get the muscles burning.  And there is a very good cardio section also (that really is cardio).

If you want to learn classic belly dance, maybe one of her other DVDs would be better designed for that (though you do get a breakdown of technique here too). If you are an exerciser wanting a new workout, this is for you!  If you are a belly dancer (like me) and you want to practice the basics while getting in shape, this is for you also!",1208736000,44,1059,4.417525773195877
3123151,5,B00144Y8XQ,"Michelle Joyce is an amazing teacher. She is warm and friendly, but not overly perky and she is not plastic and stiff like some instructers out there.  She breaks the moves down into easy to understand segments and I love the way she gives little safety and/or performance tips along the way.  There are different sessions depending on your fitness level, which is great!  As a beginner, I like that when I have mastered session 1, I can move on and not be bored doing the same thing all the time.  As someone looking to stretch my dollar, I appreciate getting multiple workouts in one package!  Be sure to check out the video clip offered in another review.  It is a very good bite of what this DVD is all about.

8254433,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I was on vacation and brought a bunch of bellydance DVDs to keep in shape. I quickly learned that the instructional DVDs were too slow paced to get a good workout from, and the choreography DVDs did not give me the exercise that I was looking for. The exception was Sera Solstice's East Coast Tribal, which has a 30 minute stretching and warm up that really fit the bill. So when I knew what I wanted, I read the reviews carefully, and this one was exactly what I was looking for! Michelle targets every area of the body, with stretches and moves that are essential to belly dance. She explains and demonstrates everything very clearly, and although they look easy, you will definitely feel it! With regular use of this DVD, I know I will strengthen muscles I did not know I had (and I am a gym rat), as well as improve my belly dancing skills. Thanks Michelle--you will be another stow-away in my suitcase!",1522713600,,907,4.469879518072289
8254434,4,B00144Y8XQ,It's a decent review of basic moves and a good workout. The music could be better. It's really hard to vibe with it at all and let yourself go dancing. She's ok. Decent teacher but doesn't grab me especially.,1424649600,,208,4.358974358974359
8254435,2,B00144Y8XQ,"She goes  through the movements at the beginning of the video so that you can get an idea of how to do it, you get time to practice a little bit.

Unfortunately, I found this video to be a bit boring and lost interest in it within a few minutes of doing it.  If you are looking for something for absolute beginners, this might help.  If you know the basics and need something more challenging, then look elsewhere.",1404864000,,414,4.269230769230769
8254436,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I love this DVD so much. These moves help me tone up and strengthen my abs, arms, and back. I have very bad posture and back but Michelle is such a great instructor, helping you through all of the simple, but effective bellydance moves and makes sure you know how to keep them safe so you don't injure yourself. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get in shape in a fun, sexy, mood and self-esteem boosting way.",1394668800,,417,4.291139240506329

8254438,4,B00144Y8XQ,"I give this DVD four stars, not because I like it, but because I think it's an excellent workout video. If you're looking for belly dance, however, this isn't the video for you, unless you combine it with other dance DVDs. There are belly dance moves in Body By Bellydance, but it isn't like dancing. I hate exercise, but love dancing. Dancercize fools me into thinking I'm having fun rather than working out. This video is mostly all exercise - and you want to be really fit with very strong leg muscles to make it all the way through! Michelle (the instructor) does show and explain things clearly. I also liked the long spells of practice which a lot of DVDs don't give you. Without a doubt, if you can get good at the workouts in this DVD, you will have strong muscles for belly dancing.",1332201600,2,791,4.424657534246576

8254440,4,B00144Y8XQ,"I bought this DVD about a month ago.... haven't done the whole workout quite yet, but I really enjoyed the beginning! It's very simple, and she goes slow for you to follow. A lot of the times I'll just skip to the yoga moves in the beginning to get a quick workout. For anyone wanting to learn bellydancing, young or old, this is a great DVD. I'd definitely buy others from michelle joyce!",1236729600,2,389,4.342465753424658
8254441,3,B00144Y8XQ,"After I read so many of the reviews, I though I would really like this DVD.  Its unfortunate that I don't.  Since I paid money I'll keep and try to use now and then, but I think Neena and Veena do a much better job.  I will give one credit that the modified dance moves do target some areas that I wouldn't otherwise be able to target.  Overall, I'm not thrilled with the DVD, but its good enough to keep.",1235260800,2,405,4.025
8254442,5,B00144Y8XQ,"I bought this quite a while ago from Amazon.  I really liked it, but it was too long and I never had time to get through the whole workout.  Otherwise, it was great.
