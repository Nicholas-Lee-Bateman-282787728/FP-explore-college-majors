3936043,4,B002ID094E,"Femmes fatales (Sixpack, 1946-64) -

Whistle stop
Algiers
Dishonored lady
The strange woman
Cause for alarm
The naked kiss.

As one reviewer already remarked: the title is a French plural, so two ending-s's (and not femme fatales). A pack of six as listed on the dvd wrapping. I have added IMDb ratings. Film #2 - Algiers, by the way. would today get its producer in jail, as it fully plagiarises Pp le Moko (Julien Duvivier, 1937, 94'). Details there as my review #195 went on amazonUK a week ago. Overall -

Actresses: Heddy Lamarr, of Czech Extase fame (Gustav Machat, 1933), is not only an attractive woman, but a (suprisingly) gifted actress. Same level as Loretta Young, who also never seems to disappoint. Ava Gardner is a lot better than also seen before, but may it be that her male partners gave her the kick? Constance Towers by far the weakest.

Directing: I disagree with the rankings, which put Fuller's film highest: Though I share some of the Nouvelle Vague enthusiasm for ""Sam Fuller"", Naked Kiss is nowhere near his best. Also, note that except for Algiers, the films are below 90 minutes running time - something nice at a time where anything below two hours tends to be taxed as lacking skill, rather than discipline ..

Best of pack: Cause for Alarm by Tay Garnett. Garnett is an old B-hand, and Miss Young I already praised. A compact chamber drama, where the rather silly representatives of the US Post Office - an external nemesis - teach you how to go by the book. The rest of the films, especially if seen as a sixpack, deserve a four out of five.

3936044,3,B002ID094E,"The lacklustre quality on these DVDs can only be excused by the fact that most of the films are otherwise not easy to find. However, they should not claim that these have been remastered, when quite obviously they're just quick transfers from any print they were able to find. The fact that they misspelled ""femmes fatales"" on the cover further suggests that this is a product more or less thrown together for the quick buck, rather than a work of love for the fanatics.

If you are looking for the films in this set, you will be fine--it's better than not being able to watch them at all. But don't expect any surprises.",1340755200,11,621,4.495575221238938

8370838,2,B002ID094E,"I only watched two of the movies so far, ""Naked Kiss,"" and some goofy story starring Loretta Young, but they were so odd, dated, stale, weird and depressing that I had to stop, for now. Things like this just wouldn't happen today, if they ever did.

I felt it made sense that I'd never heard of these movies because the stories were very weird, and didn't seem very good stories at all. Maybe some of the others are better, but the two that I watched so far were strange, grim, improbable stories about women.

The best part is that the package arrived quickly, and the vendor who shipped mine was really sweet, and sent it in some pretty Christmas wrapping with a bow! since I purchased it close to Christmas. Gosh, I sure appreciate that! That was great, but I have to be honest, the movies inside, so far are not very good.

I would - for sure - not order this again, if I had it to do over, due to the wacky, bizarre, scary weirdness of the stories. I just found the stories confusing, strangely insulting to women, and totally grim and depressing. It left me feeling bewildered!

It was like traveling in time to a place I didn't know existed, and if I had known it existed before hand, I never would chosen to visit there! So far watching these movies was sort of like having a disturbing nightmare.",1451520000,,1305,4.380165289256198
