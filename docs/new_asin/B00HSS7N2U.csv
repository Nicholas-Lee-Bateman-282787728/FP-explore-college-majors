6207547,4,B00HSS7N2U,I am so glad I decided to purchase this movie...definitely worth it! I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! Awesome eye candy too!!!,1396569600,,125,5.0
6207548,5,B00HSS7N2U,"I loved this movie because it was funny without being vulgar, romantic without gratuitous sex scenes and had a sincere premise about black people supporting each other without being preachy. It's rare that a film can do all of this, and I also liked the fact that at the end of the movie, there were no villains, only people who made sometimes selfish and/or immature choices. The acting was solid, and the writing was fresh! I will be buying this to add to my collection, lol!",1396483200,45,477,4.558139534883721
6207549,5,B00HSS7N2U,"very nice movie which showed that a black man can be a good man without thinking that sex is a game and always the number one solution. Also not the typical status quo regarding income brackets meaning that a good man .."" we few good men""..including myself can be a loving human being even if he is not in the six figures income level..just the normal every day man trying to make an honest living can be a good husband and father.",1396137600,26,431,4.2682926829268295

6207552,5,B00HSS7N2U,"This movie surprised me, because the trailer seems a little corny. Great actors. The only thing that made me as ""really??"" Was when the two exes got together. That seemed a little far-fetched. Other than that, it was a really good movie. I'd watch it again.",1396137600,,257,4.608695652173913

6207604,2,B00HSS7N2U,"I appreciate that this movie is clean and rated PG.  That's about the only thing I liked about it.
There is a lot I don't like.  One main thing- I don't really like characters.  I didn't find them interesting at all.  I kept asking myself ""why should I care?""  That's not a good thing when you're watching a movie.  Their circumstances don't feel real or relatable.  They feel forced and a little exaggerated.

Another huge flaw is some of the scenes are not necessary and irrelevant to the story.  It's like the producers needed to stretch the movie out longer and added some scenes to make it to the 1 hour and 21 min.  There is an almost 5 minute stretch with NO dialogue, just various location scenes that had nothing to do with the main story line!  And that's in the last 11 minutes of the movie.",1423526400,,802,4.351351351351352

6207607,5,B00HSS7N2U,"There were many messages the director wanted viewers to take notice to. Some you have to pay close attention to, others were quite obvious. Rejuvenate the Black dollar (community), finding love is a process (patience), ect.

This story was beautiful, it was Black, and much needed.",1422662400,,281,5.108695652173913

6207609,4,B00HSS7N2U,"This movie was a breath of fresh air.  I really enjoyed this movie and there were so many places where I kept smiling.  For once, all of the men in this movie weren't made out to all be villans and I found myself really enjoying the characters and the story line.

The ""match making"" scene was unrealistic and the following ""romantic"" scene on the playground was way too long and added absolutely nothing to the story line. Two stars because the cast is good and has a lot of potential.",1416009600,,359,4.217391304347826

6207633,5,B00HSS7N2U,a very good positive movie that showed a different side of Black love. The two primary characters (Morgan and Robert) were respectful of each other and you could feel and see their love developing for each other. The story of Black self-empowerment was presented in a way that held your attention without beating you over the head.

6207659,4,B00HSS7N2U,"I love this movie!!  My first experience was reviewing only a small snippet of the movie on BET movies while on vacay.  I vowed I would watch the entire movie on my return home. I was very pleased after watching entire movie.  The movie's content is positive and authentic. I was equally pleased with talented and predominantly African-American cast and director.  The  production, direction and photography were all outstanding.  I especially appreciated movie's lack of profanity (like ""Best Man"" movies) and lack of extreme lewdness/eroticism displayed in most relationship/romantic movies today.

Congratulations to the great cast, director, producer, photographer and crew for providing quality, authentic and interesting entertainment!  BTW, I watched behind scene/credits and discovered that a few of the actors/actress not only starred in the movie but also produced or contributed to movie in other areas.

The only thing I would suggest for improvement would be the music. This movie could have had an outstanding soundtrack.  However, music did not reduce quality of movie! I will definitely add movie to my collection!",1408579200,4,1130,5.479768786127168

It wasn't filled with stereotypes and over-acting. It was a sweet and funny romantic comedy that didn't have all the sex, foul language or vulgarity. I took away 1 star because I didn't love the ending and felt some parts were kind of predictable.

6207724,5,B00HSS7N2U,"In this day of sequels & remakes, it's refreshing to see that African-American independent film making is still flourishing.  Mark Harris-Writer/Director/Producer, doesn't disappoint his audience in this romantic comedy with a thought provoking message, which everyone can truly identify with.  The film follows Robert (Darrin Dewitt Henson of ""Soul Food"" TV series, ""Being Mary Jane"" & many more) who quickly finds out he's fired from his painter position.  This starts the ball rolling to find his true calling, for both his career & private life.  Other cast members include Gabrielle Dennis (""The Game"") as Morgan-Robert's love interest.  Lamman Rucker (""Why Did I Get Married 1 & Too"") as Morgan's ex-husband, Erica Hubbard (""Let's Stay Together"") as Robert's ""no romance without the finance"" ex-girlfriend & Christian Keyes (""Let's Stay Together"") as Robert's entrepreneurial cousin, plus the additional supporting cast bring this movie to life and add a genuine flavour.  Cinematography, lighting & sound are all on-point too, making this film entertaining and easy to watch.  Most importantly, for DVD purchasing, this movie has a high re-watchability factor to it as well.  DVD production is 5 stars too. Disc features excellent production and manufacturing. Keep case comes inserted in a movie artwork protector sleeve for a nice added touch.  Master video transfer is crisp & clean looking with excellent sound.  Extras include behind the scenes interviews with Mark Harris & cast members, plus a photo gallery.  If you're a fan of independent films, especially movies made by African-American Producers/Directors/Writers, like I am, then you will really enjoy this film.
