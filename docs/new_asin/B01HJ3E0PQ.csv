8765557,1,B01HJ3E0PQ,Nowhere on the order screen did it say this movie was in German.  I watched this movie on the Hallmark channel and it was in English which is why I purchased it. This was a waste of my money.  Very disappointed in Amazon for not stating this up front.,1485734400,,251,4.1020408163265305
8765558,1,B01HJ3E0PQ,"OK, it's a Christmas film (and Hallmark) so we didn't expect much. It was described as a comedy (which we soon discovered to be totally untrue). Just wanted to settle down and enjoy a film. The blurb states 'A guardian angel tackles his first assignment; helping a woman develop the self-confidence she lacks. Great.  Unfortunately,  the actor playing the angel (he's NOT called Mr Miracle, but Mr Mills), is in the film from the start. Yes, we get it,  he's just landed on earth; his first time, but his overplaying and overacting had me sighing from the start. He gets excited at the stairs in his house, the bed, a mirror -yes we get it!  And so the childlike performance goes on, along with odd facial expressions,  an odd pigeon toed walk, odd voice, OTT autistic/asperger's like behaviour.  We nearly switched over after watching his strange over played walk to help Eric from his car. This all reminded me of someone, another actor but I can't for the life of me think who.

As for the girl who lacks self confidence,  well I wish I was as insecure.  She didn't finish school as her dad died, so is back studying - feeling a little thick.  As for the need of an angel..............the woman lives in a great house, has a loving family, has good health and is a little touchy that she's not working, only studying - she needs a job not celestial help.",1481068800,3,1357,4.524590163934426
