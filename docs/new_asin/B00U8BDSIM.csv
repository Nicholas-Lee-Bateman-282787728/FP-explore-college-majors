8704703,4,B00U8BDSIM,"1927 Silent film. A big success in its day. Heralded as a new high in film. Received awards.
I have the 1946 remake with Joan Crawford/John Garfield/soundtrack Isaac Stern. A real favorite of mine.
I'm reading the biography of Francis Marion, responsible for writing the 1927 story. She was Hollywoods highest paid writer and one of the powerful women in the industry.
I did not know there was an original so intrigued to see it. The quality of the film is poor. Frankly I've seen much better silent films but reading about the life and work of Marion was fascinating to actually see her work. (Title: Without lying down)
Anyone interest in the history of film will appreciate this silent that's why I give it 4 stars but be advised the quality is very poor and does not have the Humoresque sound track.",1499472000,,803,4.6223776223776225
