5017073,3,B006TZPW2Q,"This was already released from the Disney Movie Club I already got it on a pre order while i won't give actual movie spoilers like plot or anything like that other then what was cut (See Below) I will say this, the set is only worth getting if you want to have both movies on a blu-ray disc or if you want to get a value for both movies since this is a valuted Disney movie. The biggest gripe that i have about this is back in 2005 when they made the 10th anniversary release of the first film they added back the cut song ""If i never knew you"" seamlessly into the film where pocahontas goes to meet up with the prisoner John Smith which really added the magic of Disney into the movie and in the end where they finished it quite nicely i might add to give the movie that great classic feel to it.
Don't expect to see that in this version of the film its only an extra on the Bluray and not even an option on the dvd and its only the one song that is mentioned above not the final clip of the film.

On a slightly better note the remaster of the music and crisp look of the animation in full 1080p is a nice touch and having both movies is another since i don't belive that they really bothered with the second movie for dvd (I could be wrong on that one).

All in all its a good price but unless you really want to get the new format personally go and get the 10th anniveresary edition on DVD. Why Disney decided to cut the extras out like they did with the Lion King ReReRelease after going through all the extra work to make the additions is a mystery but who knows.
personally i rate it a 3 1/2 stars only due to the value of getting both movies when the DVD's are out of print but if you already have both unless you really need that Blu-ray copy its not the greatest of investments.",1341532800,6,1788,4.048022598870056
5017074,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Disney's Amazing Pocahontas is one of my Favorite characters. The stories portray love, courage, and hope. Each presentation of Pocahontas is a Musical Masterpiece in itself, she's a character children adore and love, because she teaches good things and helps others. There is vibrant animation with Voice expertise with entertaining music. This is magical, charming, delightful, and enchanting for the entire family. Very Enjoyable And Highly Recommended!",1340928000,5,456,5.82089552238806
5017075,4,B006TZPW2Q,"This is my all time favorite Disney movie! I have read that it is reverted back to the original version without ""If I Never Knew You"" included in the film the 10th Anniversary DVD, but put as an ""extra"" feature. That song is amazing along with the rest of the soundtrack and needs to be in the film on the bluray disc. Why can't they have the ""original"" and the 10th Anniversary included? I would pay a little extra to have both versions included in this release. I do like that they include ""Pocahontas 2"" because I think its really the only ""decent"" sequel movie that they have done for the Disney classics. All the others just feel forced and looking to make some extra $$. I am hesitant in buying this release since I already own them on DVD and they only have the ""original"" cut of the movie.",1340409600,4,797,4.32
5017076,1,B006TZPW2Q,This title is already officially released on blu-ray by Disney in Australia. I am very disappointed in the picture quality. It looks not much different to the dvd version I already own. I am starting to question all of these bluray releases and if it is worth re-purchasing titles when there is not much difference to the previous dvd release. Anyone else concerned??,1340064000,5,367,4.841269841269841
5017077,3,B006TZPW2Q,"They had finally discarded their EGOS, and improved the movie to a level where it was able to sit on a shelf along with some of the top Disney Classics. By correcting the 10th Anniversary Edition (integrating the song ""If I Never Knew You"" and adding all-new animation), ""Pocahontas"" was able to sit along side ""The Lion King""; ""Beauty and the Beast""; ""Mulan""; ""Tarzan""; and all the other Disney Animated Musicals. ""Pocahontas"" was no longer the ""crazy cousin"" no one wanted to sit near during the Holidays.

But this was not good enough. Some ""Einstein"" at Disney decided to return it to it's ""original"" form for the Blu-ray release. If you ask them why, they just answer, ""because that's the way it was first released!"". It doesn't matter if the first version wasn't as good as the revised version; only that it was first. So they decided they were going to change the movie back to the ""original"", and just include ""If I Never Knew You"" as an ""Extra"". Well for me, too little, too late.  I'll keep watching my 10th Anniversary edition until I hear that they have a NEW version out!!!",1339459200,11,1086,4.6217616580310885
5017078,1,B006TZPW2Q,"This Blu-ray does not, repeat NOT, contain the extended 10th Anniversary Cut of the film, which was released around 2003 and integrated the fully-completed song, ""If I Never Knew You,"" into the film, along with a short reprise of the song as the last lines of the film. The scene is included on this Blu-ray release, but as a separate feature. This is an absolute shame, and while so-called animation purists prefer the original release of the film, I have seen both versions multiple times. So much is lost in character development without the deleted song in the film. Finally, unlike the Special Editions of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King,"" the extended version is the intended version. The song was cut from the film not long before release because it was ""boring to children"" in pre-screenings (It did, however, perform best among teenagers and adults who saw it then).
Whether purists held it back or (more likely) Disney wanted more space on the Blu-ray for the waste of seraph called ""Pocahontas II,"" much has been lost in this release, and I will not put up my money for an inferior edition.",1339372800,15,1111,4.731958762886598
5017079,3,B006TZPW2Q,"I LOVE Pocahontas, I remember carrying around my little Pocahontas backpack in kindergarten.  Then about 10 years later I get around to watching the 2nd movie.  Look at other reviews for this movie, it's horrible.  I would write why but I don't want to put spoilers.  Like I said, read other reviews on it.

5017118,4,B006TZPW2Q,"I purchased this two-movie special edition solely for the first Pocahontas movie to help complete my Disney animated movie collection, so the addition of the sequel was a nice bonus (however I have not watched that movie yet). The original, however, is in my opinion an underrated entry in the Disney animated pantheon. The animation is beautiful and contains some stunning sequences (""Colors of the Wind"" is especially beautiful), and very catchy songs (""Just Around the Riverbend"" being one of the most underrated songs in Disney history and extremely catchy). Admittedly, the story takes great liberty with history, but is very entertaining. I still enjoy it as much today as I did when I was a kid seeing it for the first time. The fun sidekick characters are great for kids and help provide some comic relief in what is actually a very serious story.

I would highly recommend this package for the first movie alone, so the inclusion of the second movie, even if it is of a lesser quality, is a great deal.",1499990400,,1011,4.777142857142858

5017143,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Came as expected, from a used seller. Package came in a non-bluray case, so that is the only downside but then again you're buying a used product so you can't complain too much. Ended up working perfectly, needed to upgrade from my VHS's that I've had as a child and no longer have currently.

You all know the story, basically a teenage Pocahontas meets John Smith and they realize their worlds aren't so different despite their backgrounds. A classic Disney movie of the renaissance, Pocahontas didn't ""boom"" quite as well as the other movies, but it is always a staple in my re-watching of Disney movies. I was happy to find that this version comes with the deleted song ""If I Never Knew You,"" unfortunately Disney did not treat the scene the same as the ""Human Again"" sequence from Beauty and the Beast Diamond Edition, and rather made it a deleted scene. However, it's great to finally have the scene in its full entirety, with commentary from the animators on why it was removed.

I don't care much for the sequel, and haven't seen it in years. The main purpose of this purchase was a blu-ray copy of Pocahontas, because I was slowly recollecting Disney movies to add to my collection. Since I no longer own a VCR, or have my VHS's from my childhood, these movies are the only way I truly want to watch them. I could watch them online, but instead I desire to own them since I watch them so much.

Highly recommended to anyone who is a collector, or a Disney fan. Children will enjoy it, even if it's not historically accurate. It can be ""historically"" a part of any memory of what the Disney Renaissance was like.",1490918400,3,1620,4.522184300341297

The kids love it and my husband can quote parts of it (if not all). Good family movie. Theres nothing to worry about your children seeing something you don't want them to see. Great buy! Two movies for the price of one!

Even though the story of Pocahontas and John Smith is made up it is still a good one. We love the way that two completely different lives come together and help everyone. It shows that it only takes one or two people to make a big impact.",1479772800,,629,4.07258064516129

The movie itself was great as always, but the actual set was lacking compared to other recent Disney releases. This one seems to have just been thrown together for a quick release and buck. However I am glad to own it on another format besides VHS.

The sequel was okay. It definitely shows the quality of a straight-to-video release animation-wise and in story. It is worth one viewing if you genuinely like the character. I don't find it to be one of those movies you are going to watch over and over again. It was just too predictable and certainly looks weak when held to the standards of the original.

Overall I wish this beautiful movie would have been given a release it deserves.",1453248000,4,765,4.496402877697841

The Character Designs don't accurately reflect Pocahontas' ethnicity and the story is very slow moving. I absolutely hated this movie and I believe it is the worst animated Disney movie ever made. The Sequel isn't much better either. I recommend it if you have trouble sleeping at night trust me you'll be asleep in the first five minutes.,1417651200,,460,4.8354430379746836

5017388,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Pocahontas has always been one of my favorite Disney princesses; sadly she is overlooked in comparison with many other Disney characters.  Part of why I like the story so much is because Im a big history fanatic, which is why I like Disney shows that are based on historical events or classic stories.

Of course the reaction people had to the sequel probably didn't help the popularity of the show either.  Now as far as that is concerned, I believe its really not as bad as many people make it out to be.  Sure, the first movie had better music, a more memorable storyline, and a deeper developed love story, but most original movies are like that anyway.

To be honest, I do believe it is partly Disneys fault.  If they hadnt emphasized a romantic relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith so much in the first movie, then a more historically accurate sequel with a romance between her and John Rolfe wouldnt have been so shockingly annoying to people.

However I feel if people don't compare the sequel to the original as much and look at it as its own separate story like I did, then I believe more people can have a better appreciation for it.

Besides, its not like we can use a time machine to go back and tell Pocahontas not to marry John Rolfe just to satisfy our love for the first movie.  The past is the past and Im sure Pocahontas had her reasons.

But hey, if you want to waste your time by writing bad fan fiction about Pocahontas and John Smith and complain about how much you hate John Rolfe, by all means go ahead.  I however will appreciate the sequel, and the original, for what they are worth.",1409875200,,1620,4.4391891891891895

5017416,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Pocahontas: Here is another underrated and also unappreciated classic from Disney, which became another favorite of mine. The film was based on the known facts of the historical story of the Indian princess Pocahontas and the folklore and legend that surround her. In particular, it presents a highly emotionally charged and dramatic account of the meeting between her and John Smith.

This film is also the first Disney film to be based on a real historic character; although there are no suggestions in any of the historical records that Smith and Pocahontas were ever lovers, this romantic version of the story appears only in fictionalized versions of their relationship. But I do love Disney's take on them, and they had become one of my favorite Disney couples.

Pocahontas 2 Journey to a New World: first off this film is not too bad. A little about the film. The film starts off in England where John Smith is charting his next adventure when his house is bombarded with soldiers. John fights them off and jumps from roof to roof where he looses balance and is hanging on for his life. Ratcliff helps Smith fall by stepping on his fingers and we see John fall and ""die"". Ratcliff is next seen talking to the king telling him John Smith died and that his word was true that it was best to go to Virginia and destroy the Indians. The king tells Ratcliff that he will hold off on sending his armada until John Rolfe arrives with Chief Powhatan. Back in Virginia Pocahontas tries to keep her spirits up by being around her friends Nakooma, Meeko, Flit and now Percy. Pocahontas hears a ship arrive with the blast of its canon and rushes off to the settlement to see if John Smith is there. During her visit to the settlement a horse breaks free and almost tramples a man who Pocahontas saves and he mistakes it as her attacking him. He tries to hit her when the Indian's watching over her pull back their arrows and ready for war. Pocahontas demands the halt of her people from doing harm and John Rolfe does the same for the English. Pocahontas is not happy with him and for the first time we see a change in her behavior/attitude. Later in the evening John Rolfe makes his way to the Powhatan Village and offers a horse to the great(Pocahontas)as a gift of people between the people. Little does he know Pocahontas is not chief but soon finds out, he explains that the king wants to meet with the chief to build on a bond of peace and trust. Powhatan refuses and Pocahontas goes in his place.... The trip across the sea has funny moments with Meeko, Flit and Percy. Upon arriving in London it seems everyone breaks out into song for ""what a day in London"" which is a beautiful song. The songs are nice. the most memorable for most is ""Where Do I Go From Here?"" Ratcliff returns and has some harsh and bitter interaction with Pocahontas. The term savages is not used as much in this film, now we have moved onto ""filthy barbarians"" The film hold many cute memorable scenes and the songs are done up just fine. There is a good bit of action and a nice love story. The film should be looked at as not an insult to the original but an extension that gives us more songs and more depth to characters we love. I think this is a film that should be recognized and given a chance.",1395446400,,3278,4.470784641068447

5017418,4,B006TZPW2Q,"Disney Studios 33rd full length animated feature film Pocahontas can be seen as a bit of a let down if we compare it to the four films that immediately preceded it. It is actually a very good film with stellar animation and some very good songs. The villain and comic relief characters in this film are kept in the background and are forgettable, but the story and look of the film carry it easily. While this film may not be leaps and bounds in the progression of Disney animated films, let's not forget that Disney's Pixar division would release Toy Story only months later which started a whole new revolution in the animated films department.

Pocahontas's first release to Blu Ray unfortunately is a mixed bag, the great, the film itself looks and sounds fantastic! as flawless as I can imagine it to be. the bad, the extras are light, they didn't include the alternate version of the film with the song ""If I Never Knew You."" in it. instead we are treated to the totally forgettable Pocahontas II. To make matters worse a lot of the good bonus material wasn't even carried over from the 10th anniversary DVD set!

So if you're looking for the film, meaning to own the best release of the actual movie, the Blu Ray is the way to go, but if you own the 10th anniversary DVD, you might want to hang onto in for the bonus stuff and the alternate version. Disney once again has given us a non-definitive release! I for one am getting pretty sick of it!",1392768000,,1453,4.458646616541353

5017424,4,B006TZPW2Q,"First off, I'm going to primarily talk about the original Pocahontas film and not so much about Pocahontas II because honestly, it's a typically bad sequel that is very forgettable.

Being a Disney princess film, the original Pocahontas movie is historically pretty inaccurate.  But of course it's a Disney film so you forgive that.  Pocahontas is one of the under appreciated Disney princesses but in my opinion has more depth than a lot of them.  She exemplifies bravery, peacefulness, and appreciation for the earth.  The ""Colors of the Wind"" song is fantastic and the Pocahontas soundtrack is better than some of the other princess movies.  Pocahontas' supporting characters, a raccoon named Meeko, a hummingbird named Flit, and a talking tree named Grandmother Willow, are all sweet and not obnoxious like some of the princesses' sidekicks (cough Mushu cough).  Overall, I would recommend this for preschool age children and up.",1389225600,,933,5.221476510067114

5017454,5,B006TZPW2Q,"POCAHONTAS stills shines bright in my heart and in the hearts of many. This is an amazing and poignant film.

Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast panorama of pristine North America that is the setting for POCAHONTAS. No Disney animated film would be complete without these familiar looking creatures and rightly so. These are films for the whole family, but POCAHONTAS was a notch above many of the animated films from Disney over the past two decades.

POCAHONTAS was a change-of-pace from the recent trend of animated films from Disney in 1995. This is one of my favorite Disney films and one of the best since the 1960s. It has substance and deals with real issues. We see the Native American Indians at peace and harmony with the land and nature. This is beautifully captured with the exceptional animation of vibrant green forests and flowing blue rivers. These scenes have a breath of fresh air about them that you can almost feel. When the European settlers arrive we know that it is only a matter of time before they begin to erode this paradise. The Europeans with closed minds did not realize how much they had to learn from the Indians and tried to impose their brand of civilization on them. Their brand of civilization is to subjugate or annihilate the ""savages"" and ravage the land.

We see the two cultures meet in one of the finest animated scenes ever presented by Disney. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas come face to face by a waterfall. Smith lowers his rifle, as Pocahontas stands erect and unafraid. Their eyes meet and he no longer sees a ""savage"" but a human being. Their eyes tell us that they immediately fall in love. As Pocahontas ""listens with her heart"" as Grandmother Willow has taught her they both communicate with each other. Soon their differences become apparent, but it is John Smith's ignorance revealed by inadvertently referring to Pocahontas as a ""savage"" that is the focus of the rift. He states that there is so much the ""savages"" can learn from the English. Pocahontas asks, ""If the savage one is me, how can there be so much that you don't know?"" During the ""Colors of the Wind"" sequence John Smith learns first hand the value and reverence of nature and that it should not be exploited out of mere human greed.

The message of POCAHONTAS is that European settlers leveled forests and imposed their own vision of a ""civilized"" society, whether or not it was welcome by the Native Americans. The corrupt Governor Ratcliffe is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests while his other men wield picks and axes in a mocking musical number. The brown piles of shoveled up earth stand in contrast to the majesty of the green untouched forest. When the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and prepare an execution for him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can bring them to see their transgressions and teach them that violence only breeds violence.

The dramatic structure over which the film's message is delivered deals with her father's disapproval of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race. The film thus takes on more significance as it deals with ethnic discriminations as well. Her father wants her to marry a member of the tribe, who she dislikes because ""he's so serious."" A similar theme is taken up in THE LITTLE MERMAID.

POCAHONTAS is based on legend, rooted in murky historical events. In real life, Pocahontas was about 13 when she first met John Smith. Smith claimed in his journals that Pocahontas saved his life. John Rolfe was the Englishman that she eventually married. She did indeed get to go to England as we see in POCAHONTAS II where she was treated as a princess. She died in Europe, near 21 years of age.

What is particularly good about POCAHONTAS is the artistry of the animation. The virgin land of towering green forests, sparkling blue steams and rugged cliffs are drawn with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence. Very effective is the jutting rock that overlooks the landscape giving the entire film a feeling of sweep and grandeur. Anyone viewing the finale of this film can not help feel an emotional outburst as the ""colors of the wind"" blow past this precipice toward the horizon. I know I did. The image is unforgettable.

The songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz include one unrestrained emotionally charged standout, ""Colors of the Wind."" This is an unforgettable song that can be appreciated on so many levels. It is a consummate example of melody and lyrics that make you ""Listen With Your Heart.""",1371340800,,4705,4.76441717791411

5017498,4,B006TZPW2Q,"You can safely say that Pocahontas was the last big Disney Animated movie - one that started in the mid 80s with Oliver and Company, then The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. While there were some fun movies released after Pocahontas (Hercules, Emporor's New Groove, Princess and the Frog), none really matched the decade from the mid 80s to the mid 90s.

Aside from the fact of how historically inacurate the movie is, the quality is very similar to other Disney movies. Memorable songs, cute sidekicks, strong main characters.

Sadly, the 90s also gave us a ton of REALLY BAD direct-to-video sequels, and Pocahontas 2 was one of the worst of the worst. We see Pocahontas going to England, dressing up in English period costumes, and chasing after a guy who is not John Smith. When John Smith does show up, he acts like a super-hero (seriously, watch Spiderman, then watch Pocahontas 2). Horrible horrible movie!

Visual wise - Pocahontas really pops on Blu-Ray. The shading and color pallet is amazing! A real visual feast.

Understandably, Pocahontas 2 does not hold up that well. The scenes where they used CG look awful - probably because they were never meant to be seen on anything higher-resolution than VHS. All sorts of banding issues, texture looks awful. The rest of the movie looks pretty good, sharp and great colors - just not much in the way of fine details because, once again, this was a straight-to-VHS animated release,

Audio seems to be similar. The first movie sounds fantastic, strong use of surround and low levels, especially during the storm and battle scenes. The second movie - eh. I guess there is nothing wrong with the soundtrack, but it certainly doesn't push your system in any stretch of the imagination.",1359590400,2,1771,4.8316831683168315

5017522,5,B006TZPW2Q,"I hate that some folks are too busy criticizing this film for being historically inaccurate instead of just enjoying the sheer beauty of it. A worthy successor to ""The Lion King"", ""Pocahontas"" is a visually stunning film, with a stylized look reminiscent of ""Sleeping Beauty"" in its angular and vertical design. Alan Menken composed the music with Stephen Schwartz who wrote the lyrics. Everyone knows ""Colors of the Wind"" but ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Mine Mine Mine"" are solid as well. Although the romance between Pocahontas and John can get a little cheesy at times and never reach the emotional level of ""Beauty and the Beast"", it's still a touching story, and Meeko and Percy are there to lighten things up. The film looks INCREDIBLE on Blu-ray. DVD is just not enough once you get used to the wonder that is Blu-ray. A major letdown is the lack of any serious extra here... They could have at least include the 1995 making-of that was on the Laserdisc and DVD. But I'm still giving it 5 stars because I'm rating the movie here.",1357257600,,1041,4.693989071038251

In 1995, the 33rd Walt Disney Animated Classics feature ""Pocahontas"" was the first Disney animated film to be based on a real historical character and suffice to say, the animated film was a tremendous success.

Directed by Mike Gabriel (""Oliver & Company"", ""The Rescuers Down Under"") and Eric Goldberg (""Aladdin"", ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""Fantastia/2000), with a screenplay written by Carl Binder, Susannah Grant and Philip LaZebnik.  The film would also feature the following voices by Irene Bedard (""Smoke Signals"", ""The Tree of Life""), the singing voice of Judy Kuhn (""Enchanted"", ""Mulan II""), Mel Gibson (""Braveheart"", ""Signs"", ""Lethal Weapon"" films), John Kassir (""Tales from the Crypt""), Christian Bale (""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight""), Russell Means (""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Natural Born Killers"") and Linda Hunt (""Dune"", ""Kindergarten Cop"").

Budgeted at an estimated $55 million, ""Pocahontas"" would earn over $346 in the box office and even more through home video sales.

The animated film would go on to win all three Academy Awards it was nominated for in ""Best Original Song"", ""Best Original Music Score"" and ""Best Animated Feature"".  As well as winning the Golden Globe Awards for ""Best Original Song"" and a Grammy Award for ""Best Songs Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media"" for its song ""Colors of the Wind"", sung by Vanessa Williams and its soundtrack reached number one in the Billboard 200 and earning a triple platinum certification.

Despite film critics being critical of how the animated film was not historically accurate, the film did introduce audiences to Pocahontas and for Walt Disney, the film was a financial success that would lead to an animated direct-to-video feature titled ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"".

VIDEO:

""Pocahontas"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  And I was hoping that this film would look incredible on Blu-ray and sure enough, the film looks absolutely amazing.  Despite being a film created in the '90s, the film is detailed and looks beautiful.  The film is colorful, vibrant and black levels are nice and deep.  Everything from its lush scenery to the clarity of the film, makes ""Pocahontas"" a must-own on Blu-ray.

And ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" is no slouch either.  Yes, it's a direct-to-video sequel but the film looks very good.  Granted, you can tell the difference between the amount of detail from a major feature film vs. direct-to-video film but  the animation is still crisp and vibrant, just not as gorgeous as the original film but still looks great on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Pocahontas and Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and 5.1 Dolby Digital Spanish. ""Pocahontas"" is crystal clear when it comes to dialogue and music.  From its ambiance of the wilderness to the sound of traveling on the ocean, there is good use of the surround channels and better dynamic range.  The direct-to-video sequel is good but similar to the video, you can tell the difference in the lossless soundtrack quality of the original film vs. the direct-to-video sequel.  But that's not to say ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" is bad, because it's not.  It's good, just not as great as the original film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Pocahontas"" comes with the following special features:

  Drawing Inspiration: The Lost Story of Hiawatha - (11:49)A never before seen tale that inspired the ""Pocohontas"" filmmakers.  Featuring director Eric Goldberg and historian Charles Solomon as he discusses the long-lost animated feature film ""Hiawatha"" and a read-through of what the story was about, including sketches from the Disney archives from ""Hiawatha"".
  ""Little Hiawatha"" Cartoon Short - (9:11) The 1936 Silly Symphony Short of ""Little Hiawatha"" which inspired Walt Disney.
  Deleted Song: ""If I Never Knew You"" - (4:51) A deleted song from the film featuring optional audio commentary by directors Eric Goldberg, Mike Gabriel and producer James Pentecost.
  Deleted Scenes - (15:19) Featuring nine storyboard deleted scenes from ""Pocahontas"".
  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by James Pentecost (producer) and directors Eric Goldberg and Mike Gabriel.
  The Music of Pocahontas - (7:08) Producer James Pentecost talks about the music of Pocahontas.
  Pocahontas II DVD Storybook - (6:03) A storybook version of ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"".

EXTRAS:

""Pocahontas and Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of both films.  Presented in widescreen (1:78:1), audio is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Back in the mid-90s, I remember watching ""Pocahontas"" and being amazed by its visual style but also its character design.

Featuring beautifully painted backgrounds, the visual and spiritual style that mimicked the free spirit of Pocahontas herself and in addition, having this near-Romeo & Juliet style storyline in which Pocahontas and John Smith were two individuals that could never fall in love because of their backgrounds.  Or can they?

I also do remember having watched the film and then doing my research to find out more about her and eventually finding out that she married to a man named John Rolfe.

Surprisingly, I was a bit confused until I realized that Pocahontas' and John Rolfe's storyline would be explained in the direct-to-video sequel ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"".

I enjoyed the sequel and its lively storyline as Pocahontas tries her best to become civilized by learning the etiquette and fashion of English culture.  And even more enjoyable to see the return of other character, from Pocahontas' little friends to even the return of John Smith, which would feature the intriguing love triangle storyline.

But of course, the primary difference between the two film is one was a feature film with a bigger budget and the sequel was not.  But fortunately, what made the sequel's storyline work is its use of characters but a storyline that was fun to watch.  And it's a safe family film that can easily be enjoyed by the entire family.

I am quite aware about the criticism that the film has had because of its portrayal of the characters.  Yes, Disney and the writers did not show the suffering that the Powhatan Indians had to endure from the British settlers nor was there anything dark featured in both films, aside from its antagonist Governor Radcliffe trying to start trouble between the settlers and the Indians.  But this is a Disney film, aimed at children but also a storyline that can easily be enjoyed by families.

For me, the film helped introduce me to Pocahontas and the Powhatan Indians.  But also to learn the true story of Pocahontas, to learn that there was no relationship between her and John Smith, to find out the account of Pocahontas mourning for John Smith is true, but also that she did meet John Smith once again in England is also true.  But the only thing that is never featured in the films that relates to the true story of Pocahontas is that before she met John Rolfe, she was actually kidnapped by Captain Samuel Argall, who he and his men were fighting against the Powhatan Tribe.

She was actually used as a bargaining chip and used as a way to secure the release of English prisoners held by Chief Powhatan but also the return of stolen weapons and tools.  And despite Chief Powhatan returning the English prisoners, dissatisfied by the returned weapons and tools, Pocahontas was kept as a prisoner.  Supposedly, she was able to meet with her tribe but chose to stay with her British captors.

So, there is quite a bit of story that relates to Pocahontas' life that is not featured in the film.  But still, the film was good enough to capture my interest in learning more about her, John Smith and John Rolfe.  And for the adults, there are plenty of stories that relate to Pocahontas' life, as well as John Smith and John Rolfe to look into.

But for children alone, these two films are fun and entertaining family films.  While the film for the most part is safe, there is a scene in ""Pocahontas"" where a person is killed.  No blood is shown, but he does die from a rifle shot.  So, for parents, it's really up to you if you want this scene to be shown to your children.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Pocahontas"" has never looked so much better than it does in HD.  From its beautiful, visual presentation to its immersive soundtrack, it's a colorful, fun and entertaining film that takes on cultural differences but also a watered-down, happier Disney version of Pocahontas' life.  The direct-to-video sequel is also entertaining and looks good on Blu-ray but is not as well-detailed as its original counterpart.  There are a good number of special features, a few new, while some are from the original DVD release.

And also, you do get the two DVD's for ""Pocahontas"" and ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" included with this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Pocahontas and Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" was an entertaining family film that will continue to entertain generation after generation.  Fans of the film will enjoy its beautiful presentation on Blu-ray and this is the best looking and sounding version of the film to date.  And to make this Blu-ray release quite enticing is the fact that you get two films for the price of one.  So, if you are a fan of the film wanting to upgrade or a Disney fan or parent curious about this Blu-ray release, I definitely recommend it!",1354320000,2,9771,4.978408389882788

The second movie has her kind of wide-eyed in London, but she doesn't look dumb, either.  She is trying to adapt to another culture - which has some good lessons as well.

Why would Disney back-pedal by only offering the edited verions of this film?  Sure, go ahead and offer the original version, but also offer the restored version with this wonderful song included back into the film and not as a ""Deleted Scene"".  How hard would that have been? The work of restoring the song back into the film was already done with the 10th anniversary DVD release.  Sometimes I just don't understand why these obviously poor decisions are allowed to follow through at Disney; ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" debacle being another case in point.  Also, what's with stacking the discs on top of each other in the case?  How cheap can you get?!",1347408000,21,822,4.706293706293707

5017566,3,B006TZPW2Q,"I bought this set just for the first Pocahontas movie as it's one of my favorite Disney films. There's not a whole lot of extras here, as opposed to other Disney Blu-ray releases, presumably because they felt the need to cram the sequel on the same Blu-ray; or maybe it's because Disney doesn't consider Pocahontas a strong seller. Whatever the reason, it's a bit disappointing.

On the Beauty and the Beast disc, you have the option of playing the movie with the deleted song (this is done by assembling two titles when authoring the Blu-ray with different segment mapping, and doesn't require additional room on the disc), but for one lazy reason or another, Disney decided not to do that with this disc, and instead just include the song as an extra. For what it's worth, I thought that particular animation segment was lazy, simply presenting a montage of earlier parts of the film, though the song is nice. The ""deleted scenes"" are hardly that, as they're mostly just black-and-white sketches with [simply put] awful songs being sung behind them.

I'm happy to have this brilliant film on Blu-ray, it looks and sounds great, but Disney really put their worst and laziest staff on this project and it shows.",1347062400,41,1211,4.7894736842105265
5017567,4,B006TZPW2Q,"Note: Similar to my review of The Fox and the Hound, I won't mention or review the cheapquel that is included in this set. Is just sad how Disney pairs beautifully done films with utter disgraces.

Now I'll proceed to review the original film.

Pocahontas is blamed as the responsible of finishing the Renaissance period that began with The Little Mermaid. I find those claims utterly inaccurate. While Pocahontas did not achieve the same heights of The Lion King and is not better than that one, is still a wonderful, lush and heartfelt adventure that deserves a better reputation. The animation is just glorious and the music is one of the best Disney has ever produced.

The story has been blamed as being historically inaccurate but come on, is Disney, is any Disney adaptation faithful to its source? I don't think you can expect a history lesson from a Disney movie but you can expect great entertainment and in that front, Pocahontas delivers.

The cast of characters are great and deliver stirring performances. The characters are memorable and the love story between the two leads is credible and poignant and as whole, Pocahontas is a lush, epic and emotionally profound film that still resonates after all these years after its original release.

Video & Audio

Pocahontas looks absolutely stunning on BD. A wonderful transfer that makes the film even more enjoyable. The colors pop out the screen, detail and clarity are amazing and the picture is completely stable. A wonderful image.

The 5.1 DTS HD-MA also delivers an exceptional experience with directionality and clarity in every sound, song and dialogue. A wonderful aural experience all around!

Bonus Material

The most disappointing part of this release is the fact that the the extended cut that was offered in the 10th Anniversary DVD with the song ""If I never Knew You"" included in the film is not offered in this BD. Instead, the song is just offered to be viewed on its own. This is a very bad move from Disney. While the original film is still mesmerizing, the extended cut enhanced the romance between Pocahontas and John Smith and was a beautiful moment in the movie. It's a shame that some garbage is included in this release but Disney could not give us the the second cut which is beautiful. Shameful.

Here's the rest of the bonus material:

""Audio commentary"" with the directors and producer of the film.

""Drawing Inspiration: The Lost Story of Hiawatha"" is an all new piece where director Eric Golberg talks about the story of another native american figure, Hiawatha and how his story was considered by Walt Disney to be made into a feature film. This is an interesting piece history.

""Deleted Song: If I never knew you""

""The Music of Pocahontas""

""Deleted Scenes""

""Little Hiawatha"" is a Silly Symphony from 1937

""Disney's Virtual Vault"" is the useless and cumbersome tool where most of the DVDs features are housed.

A DVD copy is also included.

Final Thoughts

Pocahontas is a beautifully done film that deserves a better reputation and a better appreciation than it has now. This BD is very good but could have been a lot better. First of all a standalone release would have been much better. Second the inclusion of the extended cut and third the exclusion of the Virtual Vault and the inclusion of all the extras in physical form. Anyway, this BD features stellar video and audio and the movie is wonderful so it comes recommended.",1346976000,14,3429,4.829059829059829
5017568,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World has the benefit of having lots of additional story left to tell so it doesn't lend itself to the repetition of some sequels. It's actually one of Disney's best direct-to-video sequels story-wise, since the first film kind of left things hanging.

Being a fictionalized biography, it is known that Pocahontas had quite a life after she met John Rolfe and moved to England. The film makes the most of every opportunity, from the My Fair Lady-like sequence in which the young maiden is versed in the English trappings for a grand ball to the inspiring way Pocahontas stands up to yet another king for what is right and true.

Whether or not most of the story actually happened is beside the point -- this is Hollywood, folks -- and there's even a disclaimer at the end of the credits encouraging viewers to read up on the real-life lady. Now that both Pocahontas and Pocahontas II are combined on one Blu-ray, the films fit together nicely.

One can dispute whether or which film has better songs, but why? Just enjoy the musical excellence in both: Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz in one, Marty Panzer and Larry Grossman in the other. Grossman is another of my musical heroes, having written the incredible ""Just One Person"" for the musical Snoopy. This gorgeous song became a Muppet Show icon (he wrote for that series, too). Bernadette Peters sang it to Kermit when he guest-hosted The Tonight Show and it was performed at Jim Henson's memorial service.

He also wrote another iconic song -- the countermelody, ""Peace on Earth"" for David Bowie to sing as Bing Crosby crooned ""Little Drummer Boy"" on Bing's last TV special. Both Pocahontas 1 & II soundtracks are currently available for download on amazon.",1346889600,,1744,4.78405315614618
5017569,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Pocahontas is a DVD that while it is not accurate to history, it is a great story for children, little girls especially.  It tells the tale that women can be strong and confident and tough decisions need to be made.  The 3-Disc Special Edition includes three discs:  Blu-ray with both movie titles and a separate DVD for each title.  There are actually two full-length movies in this set:  Pocahontas and Pocahontas 2. I had actually never seen (or heard of) Pocahontas 2 so it was nice to watch that.  This is definitely a Disney title that has not gotten a lot of exposure but its still a great one to add to the collection.  The animation and sound has also been remastered, while still keeping the original animation in tact.",1346889600,,729,4.561538461538461
5017570,3,B006TZPW2Q,"Disney continues its Blu-ray releases of the animated movies from their 1990s ""Renaissance"" with ""Pocahontas"" and its sequel, ""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World,"" thrown in for fun. The three-disc collection features the two films on one Blu-ray and individually on two DVDs. Both are quality projects but look completely different in comparison to each other. Each received a nice facelift and restoration to make them look better than they ever have before.

""Pocahontas"" shows us how the young Native American Princess meets Englishman John Smith. The two engage in a romantic relationship which brings to mind Romeo and Juliet. Her Indian tribe and his group of settlers clash over the land with tragic consequences.

This was the first Disney movie based on an actual historical figure. It does a great job of keeping true to the spirit of the actual incidences it's based on. That's not to say it doesn't stray away from fact or embellish a bit to keep things interesting and family friendly. There are messages of racial equality and environmental preservation throughout the film as well. What would a Disney movie from the 1990s be without social commentary?

""Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" is the direct-to-video sequel which takes our title character to England as a diplomat. She's dispatched to prove to the King that the Native Americans aren't savages and can live in peace with new settlers. Along the way, she meets up with John Smith and falls in love with John Rolfe. She must choose between the two while learning to be ""proper"" and foiling the attempts of saboteurs who want to have the Indians exterminated so the Americas can be conquered.

The follow-up isn't as smooth as the original in its animation style. There's a big difference in the quality. If you were just stepping into the movie having not seen the first one in a long time it wouldn't be as noticeable. If you watch them back-to-back the differences are apparent. That's not to say the animation is poor quality. It's just not as polished as its big-screen predecessor.

""Pocahontas II"" fits into the ""Disney Princess"" mold better than the first film. John Smith leaving Pocahontas behind at the end of the first movie didn't give me a sense of ""Happily Ever After"" I expect from these types of movies. The sequel ends on a more positive note that easily ushers the Native American into the Hall of Fame of Disney Royalty.

The high-definition transfer of both movies is wonderful. The animation and picture are clear and vibrant. Alan Menken, Stephen Schwartz, Lennie Niehaus, Blaise Tosti, Stacy Widelitz, Larry Grossman, and Marty Panzer's songs and the excellent sound effects and musical score all blend together beautifully thanks to an incredible 5.1 surround mix.

The bonus materials for this release are centered on ""Pocahontas."" There are no extras for ""Pocahontas II."" Audio commentary by producer James Pentecost and co-directors Eric Goldberg and Mike Gabriel is found. There's a seven-minute featurette entitled ""The Music of 'Pocahontas,'"" nine deleted storyboard scenes, and a deleted song called ""If I Never Knew You."" We also get the animated Silly Symphony short ""Little Hiawatha"" and a 12-minute featurette about the movie ""Hiawatha,"" which was never made. You get access to Disney's Virtual Vault which contains more featurettes and extras from the original DVDs.

These movies are different from most of the Princess animated features like ""Cinderella,"" ""Snow White,"" or ""Beauty and the Beast."" Instead of waiting for Prince Charming to come along, Pocahontas takes matters into her own hands. Many females will embrace the concept and identify with the message of the movies. For Disney collectors, the three-disc ""Pocahontas / Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World"" Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack is a must-own collection. Consumers will be happy with the adequate amount of special features and two great high-definition transfers.",1346716800,,3952,5.097372488408037

5017573,1,B006TZPW2Q,"The night that I saw the Central Park (NYC) premiere of Pocahontas, it was apparent that it had been truncated, leaving behind a large,enervating hole which totally drained all drama and interest from its final sequences.  I was to learn that this was the result of the excision of the song ""If I Never Knew You"" from the climatic moments of the film.  It was pathetic that Disney released this truncated and devalued version of the film.

However, after the song was restored seamlessly in the ""10th Anniversary"" DVD, there seemed no reason to doubt but that this restored version would be part of the expensively priced Blu-Ray edition. Thus, I pre-ordered it (with an attractive discount) which I cannot help to think was meant to hype sales before word got out of the moronic decision to provide only the dreadfully cut version.  I have no desire to view it.  Including the song as a bonus does not compensate for the inability to experience the more resonant restored version of the movie..  How do I get my purchase price back?  I do not know, but I will try.  Maybe  the best hope of seeing Pocahontason Blu-Ray lies in YOUR not buying this garbage cut, as well as in those of us who have already bought it, demanding a full refund.

WHAT'S MISSING?
If you are unable to access Disney's Virtual Vault, you are missing out on a great number of extras from Pocahontas' 10th Anniversary Edition DVD, including Vanessa Williams' ""Colors of the Wind"" music video, sing-alongs for ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colors of the Wind"", the set-top game ""Follow Your Heart"", ""Disney's Art Project"" videos on making a drum and dream catcher, an unmissed Tarzan II sneak peek, 28-minute documentary ""The Making of Pocahontas"", a multi-language reel, a storyboard-to-film comparison, a production progression demonstration, two trailers, a piece on the film's Central Park premiere, a short on the completion of ""If I Never Knew You"", the music video for Jon Secada and Shanice's end credits version of the song, character test animation, and galleries of character designs and publicity art. Dropped from Pocahontas' original non-anamorphic Gold Collection DVD and not resurfacing are a trivia game and DVD storybook (that disc also supplied the Vanessa Williams music video).

From the one and only Gold Collection DVD of Pocahontas II, a trivia game and the read-yourself version of the DVD Storybook are dropped, while Little Hiawatha becomes a Blu-ray-only feature.

But that in itself is merely annoying, and not a deal breaker (I already choked down The Fox and the Hound 2 and Sister Act 2 in order to get the good original films; I just don't acknowledge the sequels as part of my collection...but rather as terrible ""bonus features"" that I'll never watch).

No, the really sad and disappointing thing about this release is that they've once again cut out the song, ""If I Never Knew You"".  When the 10th Anniversary DVD set came out in 2005, I was thrilled to see the song finished and re-inserted into the film.  And according to the audio commentary on that version, the directors themselves were delighted to finally have the song included, as they had never wanted it cut in the first place.  Also nice was that the DVD set gave viewers a choice: watch the movie with the song restored, or watch the original theatrical cut of the film.  Choice is always good, and it worked beautifully.  If it could work so well on DVD, it would certainly have worked on blu-ray!  (The Beauty and the Beast blu-ray included THREE versions of the film!)

I am so disappointed and disgusted, that I will not be buying this blu-ray...I wouldn't even want it for free!  The film is much better with the song restored, and since seeing it that way, I never want to watch it again with the song cut out.  I'll be keeping the 10th Anniversary DVD, which is so far the only way to see the film as the directors intended.",1345593600,19,1629,4.469594594594595
5017582,2,B006TZPW2Q,"I'm going to start off by saying that the 2 star review is NOT for the movie itself - although I really cannot stand Pocahontas II and wished that this was just the first movie. I pre-ordered this movie and received it 1 day after release (talk about fast shipping!).

Now this is advertised as a 3 disc combo pack. Imagine my surprise when I open the case up and see only 2 discs with no extra space for a 3rd. I pulled out the Pocahontas DVD and there underneath was the Pocahontas II DVD! Now I don't know about you, but I'd definitely prefer my discs to be in separate spaces! I'm definitely not okay with this set up. I'm half tempted to throw away the Pocahontas II DVD since in my mind that movie doesn't exist. But as I paid for it, I'll keep it. I guess I'm just going to put it in a separate jewel case so as to not scratch my Pocahontas DVD.",1345593600,4,852,4.071428571428571
5017583,4,B006TZPW2Q,"Always loved this movie, but after watching it, unlike the 10th anniversary version, ""If I never knew you"" deleted scene is not included. It is included in the Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo version but you cannot view it while watching the film but as an extra on it's own. The movie truly is better with the scene included, but i guess that's what I get for buying this version.",1345593600,3,378,4.573529411764706
5017584,2,B006TZPW2Q,"I was very excited about Pocahontas Blu Ray releasing because is my favorite Disney movie., but sadly I found that The 10th anniversary edition of the movie that includes new animation with the song ""If I never knew you"" (with voices of Judy Kun and Mel Gibson)appears in this blu ray only as a part of the bonus material, WHY DOES DISNEY DeCIDE NOT INCLUDE BOTH VERSIONS OF THE FILM LIKE IN 2005 TWO DISC EDTION?
Pocahontas is one (or the most) adult and sofisticated disney classic, with great direction and beautiful art, romantic and magical atmospheres, and a powerful story with not the tipical happyly ever after princess movie ending.
Yes, the quality of the sound and image is perfect, but I really prefer my 2 disc 10th anniversary edition. I'd rather Pocahontas II was exclude and put Pocahontas extended version, I hope they'll do it, meanwhile I returned the combo to the store because I wasn't happy with it, besides on the back cover says that includes ""A making of Pocahontas"" (Mexican edition) and never could find it, beacause there was not.",1345420800,10,1059,4.760869565217392
5017585,5,B006TZPW2Q,"Both of the movies that you receive in this pack are ones that my family has enjoyed for some time. I will be honest and say that we are partial to the first one, but my kids will ask for both too. I love the fact that in this pack you get both movies in one pack as this cuts down on the space you need to store as well as saving you money overall (which is always a plus)! The movies themselves are great and you will love the bonus features that are provided in this. The set comes with so much to choose from, so you get the best of both worlds whether you watch this ion DVD or Blu-ray or even Digital Download. Also, you receive amazing sound quality in this set. You not only get the amazing song writing that was presented in this movie, but you can crank up the music and simply enjoy as the quality of the recording is superb. Overall I have to say if you are a Disney fan, this is definitely one that you will want in your collection!",1345075200,2,945,4.005291005291006
5017586,2,B006TZPW2Q,"Back in the mid `90s, the Disney studio excised a pair of songs from two of their releases - ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" - that both negatively impacted the theatrical versions of each film. The reasoning was simple: the songs in question (""When Love Is Gone"" from the Muppets and ""If I Never Knew You"" from ""Pocahontas"") were too ""adult"" in nature, leading some parents to take their kids out to the snack bar or the bathroom to avoid sitting in their seats for the 3-4 minutes those respective numbers were on-screen.

It didn't matter that the songs were vital to each movie - comprising arguably the most dramatic moments of both stories - or that anyone other than a restless five-year-old wouldn't have had a problem sitting through them. The editing shears were out, and neither song would appear in the theatrical release of either picture. Flash-forward several months. Once ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" hit video, director Brian Henson insisted on the restoration of ""When Love Is Gone,"" and the song was thankfully added into all video releases of the 1992 production (though sadly not its later DVD release). ""Pocahontas,"" sadly, would not have its climactic song restored until a 10th Anniversary DVD release in 2005.

Unfortunately, that song - Alan Menken's lovely ""If I Never Knew You"" - is once again absent from the Blu-Ray of POCAHONTAS, which has just arrived in a BD/DVD double-pack with its inferior direct-to-video sequel ""Pocahontas II: Journey To a New World.""

It doesn't matter that the movie is one of the weaker Disney productions from the `90s, or that the Politically Corrected-story has numerous holes. ""Pocahontas"" still manages to modestly entertain in spite of its flaws primarily because of its gorgeous score by Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, encompassing ""The Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend."" Alas, for whatever reason, Disney has once more opted not to include the longer version with ""If I Never Knew You,"" a duet between Pocahontas (sung by Judy Kuhn) and John Smith (a surprisingly effective vocal performance by Mel Gibson), sung near the conclusion of the film.

Without ""If I Never Knew You,"" ""Pocahontas"" essentially has no climax. The movie's sometimes jumbled story - with its one dimensional villains (gasp! That evil governor of Virginia is a nasty one!!) - and confused perspective on the Pocahontas-Smith relationship reeks of the P.C. police, and minus the duet, the film also doesn't flow properly, with a particularly abrupt final third. It's a problematic but interesting entry in the Disney canon, boasting some of Menken's finest work and one of the nicest love themes you'll ever hear in an animated movie - but, as was the case with the theatrical release, it's been relegated once again to a mere end credits pop duet between Jon Secada and Shanice.

With its crisp and beautiful new Blu-Ray remastering, the movie has, at least,  never looked better on the small screen. The film's bold colors and striking animation are superlatively rendered, while the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is likewise effective in conveying the rich musical texture of the soundtrack. Extras (in addition to standard DVD copies) are mostly reprisals of material found in Disney's deluxe CAV LaserDisc box set of ""Pocahontas"" (likewise carried over to the 2005 DVD). These include commentary with the filmmakers (recorded in 2003) and plenty of featurettes - albeit some of them only available through Disney's online ""Virtual Vault"" (requiring a BD Live connection). Adding insult to injury is that ""If I Never Knew You"" is indeed present as a supplement - and in full HD - making it even more frustrating the song couldn't have been included, as an option, to view integrated within the movie itself.

""Pocahontas"" may always be viewed as somewhat of a black sheep, particularly compared with the high quality of Disney's theatrical output from the `90s, and it's unfortunate that the improvement yielded by including ""If I Never Knew You"" has been negated by the bad decision to drop it from this package. Hopefully the same situation won't repeat itself when ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" arrives on Blu-Ray later this year.",1345075200,153,4204,5.0489913544668585
5017587,4,B006TZPW2Q,"This movie makes my ""short list"" of favorite Disney films. The story is good, if stylised, the music is great, the animals don't talk, (even if the tree does), and Pocahontas gets the award for Best Hair. A perfect family film.",1343952000,6,227,4.560975609756097
5017588,5,B006TZPW2Q,"I remember when the film came out in 1995 I was originally not too interest in the idea for the film & Disney doing it.

Bought the video tape & I was surprised.  Great film, beautiful animation & that Oscar winning music.

The sequel, never had much interest in it.  Thought it was unnecessary to do.

Blu ray package has extras, decent.

Now, the problem I have with this package.  Blu ray Disney promoting how great it is & picture quality.  In the other Disney blu/ray DVD combo packs the blu ray discs have colorful art work, only SOMETIMES the DVD does.  In this package Disney is NOW GOING CHEAP WITH BLU RAY  Both films are on 1 blu ray disc & the disc is plain jane blue.  Then 2 DVD's 1 for each film & they are plain jane silver.  Cheap Disney, very, very cheap & disappointing.

5017589,4,B006TZPW2Q,"Let me start out by saying that Pocahontas is probably one of the most underrated Disney animated features of all time, and deserves five stars. But this review isn't just for Pocahontas, it's also for Pocahontas II - Journey to a New World, which drags the overall rating down, (though if I were rating II by itself, it would barely scrape up a rating of two stars.)

Pocahontas is a wonderful film, with memorable characters, including one of my personal favorites, Meeko the raccoon,  wonderful music, both the songs and the score are lovely, and a great story.

Journey to a New World is disappointing. The music is all right, but aside from the opening piece Where Do I Go From Here, none of it is very memorable. The characters, well, the animals keep their lovable affect intact, but everything else, is just so wrong.

Though Pocahontas does end with a less then happy fairy tale ending that most Disney movies do, it should've been left that way, and Journey to a New World should've never been made.

I'm excited to add Pocahontas to my blu-ray collection, and Journey to a New World coming with it isn't a bad deal. If anything I can use it to explain to friends why Disney sequels are usually some of the worst movies ever made.",1343174400,8,1240,4.5675675675675675
