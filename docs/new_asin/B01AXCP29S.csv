8748790,4,B01AXCP29S,"I bought the first press limited edition Blu Ray Tokyo Dome concert from a different site and I absolutely love it. The boys are seriously so talented and hardworking. It is worth mentioning that for such a high price the DVD does not come with a photocard and the photobook is fairly small. Also, Lay was not at this concert. I don't know about anyone else but I was not made aware of this before ordering and that definitely would have influenced my decision in ordering this version.",1460937600,5,486,4.534090909090909
