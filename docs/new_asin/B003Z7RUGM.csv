8409970,5,B003Z7RUGM,"I knew going in that this was the European format.  I still have to go back to Europe, and get a  player (and converter/adaptor for it), but the show is worth it!  Great acting. I'm learning Spanish, and the fact they did this in contemporary Spanish is a great help.  In the intervening time, I can watch it on RTV internet, but at least I will have the ability later on to watch them on my own player.  This is a show that has a huge fan base, and justifiably.
