4716849,3,B005KCIQQS,"I found this workout to be a good and effective one overall, but Pauline could use a little improvement. If you are new to exercise Pauline does a terrible job of actually teaching a person how to correctly perform the moves. I even see where she and her backup girls use improper form sometimes. At times she moves too fast and it can be difficult for a person to follow along properly without hurting themself. I also think she talks too much especially since she isn't really teaching. Again, I say the workout is okay but she is definitely no Jillian Michaels. I would suggest you be someone who is definitely more familiar with exercise terminolgy and form before attempting this.",1315785600,6,685,4.669421487603306

4716851,5,B005KCIQQS,"Caught this series on Exercise TV and the free time was running out. I just had to have this CD. I knew I would miss doing them. Since doing her routines, I have noticed a difference in my glute area and in the way my jeans are fitting. I never did with any other workout routine.

Her upper body routines also awesome and like I said, just had to have it. I would have definitely missed these workouts once Exercise TV took them off the air.

As she says, these are some bad a** routines but her constant chatting keeps it lively and fun. So for me, I like her style and personality as well.

The Butt Bible is the best DVD that I have ever purchased. The results are amazing! I saw visible results within the first week. I am now on level 2 after doing the program for 6 weeks. I never thought I would have the courage to wear shorts in public again, well the Butt Bible has made this possible for me. It is a tough but doable program. It is actually a total body program with separate workouts for lower and upper body, providing more bang for your buck. I also follow a sensible eating program and get my cardio in (Simply Fit Board) 5 times a week for 15 minutes. Please see my review of the Simply Fit Board here on Amazon. This has been the best combo for me and it works!",1497312000,2,839,4.217391304347826

4716864,2,B005KCIQQS,"I've done all of Jillian Michaels' workouts, and most of Beach Body's. I thought I'd try someone new.  I read people's reviews regarding the instructor's annoying ""chatter"" throughout the workout. What an UNDERSTATEMENT!!! Her incessant rambling wasn't just annoying, it was so ridiculously hilarious, I kept bursting into laughter!! Here are some gem's from month two: (PS imagine these in the voice of The Muppet's ""Swedish Chef"")  ""I named my butt 'Mr. Butt'. That's right...my butt is a man!""  ""Now squat down like you're going to ride a big, fat pony!""  The woman does not shut up. Even the instructors behind her look like they're stifling giggles. I thought I could tolerate it at first. But, by the end of the workout, I wanted to throw the dvd off my balcony.  I'd also like to add, that the workouts themselves, are rather repetitive and boring. If you're used to the quick pace of Shaun T or any Beach Body coach, you will probably find these extremely monotonous and boring. There's about 4 moves total, that you repeat with three sets of each. YAWN. I should've spent the extra cash and purchased Brazilian Butt Lift. ;)",1470182400,12,1133,4.78974358974359

4716874,5,B005KCIQQS,"I was recommended this workout by a Beachbody coach, which says a lot I think.  I too am an avid fan of all BB products having tried and loved Insanity, 21 Day fix and Extreme, T25, ChaLean, Pylo, TurboFire, and Brazilian Butt Lift.  But with every one of those workouts, I still had problems with my rear end area and gaining muscle in the back of my thighs.  This workout though resolved it!  What I love about this this workout is that it not only helps my butt, but it includes workouts for all other areas of your body, similarly to 21 Day Fix.  Also, you can do this workout if you are beginning you exercise routine or if you've been exercising for years.  One fault that I would find with the workout is Pauline's motivational speech needs some work.  She sounds Eastern European and the language translation and wording she uses can sound a bit harsh at times.

4716885,4,B005KCIQQS,"I think this exercise DVD is really good.  What I like most about it is that Pauline, the instructor, keeps with one exercise for awhile.  This is unlike many other exercise DVDs that are always switching things up so that you no sooner start one thing and then they are on to something else.  This can be annoying and confusing for me and then I just don't want to do it any longer.
Also, this program is very thorough and comprehensive.
The only negative I would say is that the instructor talks through the whole thing and there is no music.  The talk just gets to be too much so I put it on mute and then turn on music that I like.  Works like a charm and I enjoy this otherwise very good exercise program.",1451433600,2,710,4.1911764705882355

4716901,4,B005KCIQQS,"I'll update this review as I get more into it, but I wanted to review it right away because I love it already!

The level 1 is deceptive.  The moves are super old school.  It reminds me of the types of exercise videos my mom did in the early 90s, so when I first watched it, I was under impressed (I watched the whole level 1 first before trying to make sure the videos didn't skip like some people reported and I wanted to get a feel for the type of exercises).  I then went through the whole level 1 expecting it to be super easy, but I really got a good 'burn'!  I was sore the next day, especially with the upper body, but that's mostly because I neglect my upper body when working out.  Again, the moves seem a little old school, cheesy, but they work great.  This kind of set up is so much better for someone less coordinated like me.  There are no 'moves' to learn and with the more complex videos, I find I don't get quite the same level of exertion because I'm trying to stay with the instructor.  I tried BBL (brazil butt lift) and argh!  I wanted to like it so much, but it was so difficult to follow.  I might give it another shot in 6 weeks after finishing these videos, but I really don't think it's made for women like me who aren't so much into the choreographed steps.  I also love Jillian Michael's (especially the 30 day one -- a favorite!).  I would compare Pauline Nordine's Butt Bible to Jillian Michael's in terms of complexity of moves and overall burn.

I don't find her talk annoying like others do, but she is repetitive and chatty...I guess you could turn the volume off if it gets to you.  I do watch it with the volume at a very low level, mostly because I'm a pretty private person and don't like blaring my exercise routine to the neighborhood.  The set, editing, and music are crazy cheesy, but I don't really care.  I'm not watching this as a movie -- just as a replacement for a trainer to guide me along.  Anyhow..I'll update with results after a few weeks, but like I said, my initial opinion is LOVE.

Update 10/11:
I have dropped the rating one star because of level 3.  I was LOVING level 2 and I wanted to stay on it for weeks and weeks to come, but I know that doesn't help me any.  Level 3's big change is use of additional equipment - a chair and a bar.  These seem simple enough, but I don't own a chair that I care to damage by standing on it.  I have some stacking stools, so I used those, but the height was off a little.  I also didn't own a bar and she added no discussion of it -- was it a weighted bar?, how much weight?, is there a way I could have used dumbbells instead?  I tried using a broomstick, but that seemed pointless.  I ended up using dumbbells.  Ultimately, my balance is way off and I was consistently missing 1/2 the sets because I kept falling (Level 3 emphasizes using 1 leg at a time).  I ended up dreading the workout and was skipping days. That's not good, so I ended up going back to Brazilian Butt Lift instead.  Actually, I think that was a really great transition.  When I tried BBL prior to the Butt Bible, I couldn't keep up because the dancy-dance moves in combo with the exertion of underdeveloped muscles made it too much for me.  After having done 6ish weeks of the Butt Bible (I slacked one of those weeks and I never felt like I got what I was supposed to get out of level 3 because of the balance issue), I had definitely gained some impressive lift and muscle toning in my butt and legs to where BBL seemed more do-able.
Final results:  Yes, I loved it.  I would buy it again and do levels 1-2, followed by some other more advanced video like BBL.  I gained some impressive muscle tone.  My upper body actually experienced great results too.  My muscle head husband did upper body level 2 with me once and he was surprised at how the routine targeted some little used muscles in the shoulders.  I have some serious improvements in upper body definition.  My diet was mostly spot on (until the end) and I tend to lose upper body weight first, so that muscle tone is more obvious.  I'm about 20-22% body fat and I tend to carry it in my lower half and I have plenty of fatty booty left....so the videos have given me a more shapely and lifted booty, but I still have cellulite on the back of my thighs and some smallish saddlebags.  I think this really needs to be given more time with good exercise and diet.  6 weeks of this won't give me a VS model body, but I'm certainly on my way there!",1439856000,10,4477,4.207746478873239

Let me say that I have about 50 workout dvds and I have never felt so turned off by an instructor. Pauline talks constantly and some of what she says is just flat out obscene (references making love to your butt, sweat dripping in between the cheeks). Some of what she says is flat out obscene (like I just referenced) and then also just commentary that comes across as stupid and extremely superficial. I find this to really detract from the workout. And while the workout is decent, it is very repetitive and I was not particularly impressed. I like this enough that I will still use this in my rotation but if I happen to be working out at home and others are in the house, I am humiliated because of Pauline's presence.

4716942,5,B005KCIQQS,"Awesome DVD! I am used to working out with heavy weights and low reps  (which I still think is great). However, I was ready to  change things up and  focus my workouts on conditioning the smaller, often left out muscles (the helper muscles) to get a more well-rounded workout. Afterall, if the helper muscles don't get worked out enough, this sets us up for a weak framework (more injury) of which to build on the larger (glamor) muscles most tend to focus on in their workouts (me).  I originally got this work out to focus on getting a great butt workout.  I find many DVDs out there don't really focus so much on really hitting all angles of the butt and this DVD does just that!  I have already noticed a change in my buns after about a month  of this DVD just by using level 2 and less weights than Paula.  I haven't seen results in my butt like this from any of the exercise DVDs I have used in the last 10 years.  Those videos tend to focus more on dead-lifts, squats, lunged etc.... which are awesome too, but do not hit all angles of the buns (this DVD uses those moves and then some).  I'm all about focusing on great form at this point then the amount of  weights used during an exercise. I would say I am at an intermediate fitness level and this DVD can easily be tailored to each individuals needs.  I love the high reps and low weights, something I am not used to.  The upper body DVDs are great too! I feel awesome after this workout, like I got a total body workout that was safe and effective and my buns and arms arms are on fire!  Oh, and the upper body DVD includes an ab workout which is great  too.  I like to do upper and lower body together 3x/ week. It's neat because you can mix and match the levels according to your needs.  To those of you who are used to lifting heavy and want to continue doing so, you can easily do that with this DVD,however, you would not be able to do as many reps. You only need 1, 3, 5 lb weights (mainly for upper body stuff), or you can use food products home if you have no dumbbells=) ..",1416787200,5,2045,4.149746192893401

But lets get real woman, in order to lose the flab/fat I'd have to get skeletal skinny. I'm not overweight. Kinda on the skinny side. Just have areas that I can only get rid of through liposuction. It takes $$ for that. This w/o is not cardiovascular so you'd have to add your own w/o for that. You can lose your balance on some moves & she doesn't tell you that you can use a chair for balance.

I was never offended by her....not even a little bit. Quite honestly, its clear she's joking and you would have to be pretty uptight to take her seriously. I actually never get bored of watching her video because she keeps talking. My only issue is that I'm a black girl. We like having big, nice butts. What I didn't take into consideration when I started the lower body workout is that it consists of cardio and muscle building combined. But not enough muscle training (in my opinion)! I lost like 2-3 inches of butt!!! Seriously! I was only 42 inches to begin with! Got down to like 39 3/4 inches. And no! My stomach did not go down with it! I was doing the upper body workout also (I would actually alternate between upper and lower body). I stopped after that and started doing other muscle training workouts. But my butt is better formed since I started her workout. Honestly, she knows what she's talking about. I did her workout consistently alternating upper and lower body every day for 7 days a week for about 2 months at least. I got up to level 2 only. My body looked damn good combine with my diet.

Btw, don't get me wrong, you absolutely must do some form of cardio to reshape the fat in your butt. But this combo of cardio and tiny weights didn't work for what I wanted. Not 100%. But I suggest getting heavy weights to combine. How heavy? Pretty damn heavy. Do some research on muscle building. I got a new laptop and phone otherwise I'd post some links.

4716965,4,B005KCIQQS,"I'm taking the time to write this review because as a woman, not only do I want to look my best, but I want other women to reach their personal fitness goals and look their best as well.

First of all, I love working out by butt and thighs, toning them as well as gaining muscle on them for a more plump, feminine appearance. Getting a nice toned butt is not all genetics, don't believe that... it is possible to shape your butt and thighs through exercise (ankle weights, toning bands, etc. make a big difference in adding muscle to these areas not working out alone.)

But... as one lady to another, although I am happy to have purchased the Butt Bible, I would not recommend it for shaping the butt. The exercises from the video will tone your butt, but if you want a curvy butt, this may not work for you. Working out with Pauline reminded me of being in a gym with a personal trainer that knows how to get you militarily toned... but that's as far as it goes.

Because I love to work my butt and thighs in any routines that I do, this was not a waste, at least when I'm doing the routine, I know my butt will receive toning but... when I want to shape my butt, I will return to the Brazilian Butt Lift workout.

Some ladies may not understand this, but if you have NEVER done the Brazilian Butt Lift, it's impossible to know that there is a difference in how your butt feels and shapes over time with it. I saved up for my BBL dvds as they were expensive. With the Butt Bible, yes, you end up doing a challenging work out, but if the end effect is just pain with a bit of tone, that's just not enough for me.

After doing the BBL for several months, I now feel when different muscles in my butt and legs are being worked.... as I did the Butt Bible, it was as if several muscles weren't even being moved... which means, they weren't activated by the Butt Bible  workout as they were with the Brazilian Butt Lift... that tells me that something is lacking in this workout. As a skinny minny, I can't afford to do a workout that won't give me maximum curvyiness for my effort spent doing it. I don't have an pear body, so plan toning just leaves me thin.

As I mentioned before, I don't regret buying the dvd, I can still workout my butt with this. BUT, as a body conscious female, I'm telling other ladies, please check out the Brazilian Butt Lift if you are looking to not only lift the butt, but round it out and shape it. I used to be very thin, but I didn't have any shape to me, no hips, just flat... I had to make a choice, did I want to just be thin or have some feminine roundness to my body. That took me on a quest to look for herbs, exercises, and techniques to get the curves I was looking for. The world tells women to starve themselves and look like stick pins, any curves we have... we are told to hide it away. It's just awful...

Not everyone wants to hear a bad review about a workout routine. I just don't want to lie when someone maybe thoroughly researching for help about whether or not to buy. I hope this helps.",1405468800,26,3039,4.165247018739352

I had gained a decent amount of lift, shape and all around good butt health. (woot) So I'm 100% cool with the workout itself

The one downside to it though (in my opinion) was the trainer. I mean, I liked her at first because she had this sort of funny-cutesy thing going on (disc1) which I really enjoyed. That and she also stuck with the workout herself (for the most part...'disc3-cough*'). But after that (disc2) the whole, ""chatty cathy syndrome"" she had going on just got to be too much for me and eventually turned a little sour toward the end (disc3).  And by ""sour"" I mean, ""Dear god woman, I'm not into that crap so please shut it while I finish up with the rest of these ridiculous squats of yours. ;O_O; ""

So.

I think her mindset would appeal to those who are more...materialistic(?). I mean it's cool if you are (no judgment) but if you're someone who's fitness goals are more about feeling healthy and comfortable then I think you might be happier with something else. :/ Just saying.

Unless of course you decide to get it anyway and just mute the woman then play some music instead. Well then...

There is no one doing a modified version of her workout in the background. As you progress to levels 2 and 3 you will notice her exercise companions struggling to keep up with her. I love that she did not tone down the workout. I love that she tells you inappropriate things like, ""if you have a great piece of ass you have everything"" because when I want to quit the workout that's exactly what I need to hear to keep going. She is funny and motivating. Maybe some people with be annoyed by her chatter but I think it kept me going when the going got tough. When she tells you that you will see results she is right, if you do the work, you will see results. I also recommend pairing it with the Game On Diet.

I have been doing them 3 times a week and see a difference in my inner and outer thighs. They are tighter and I know as I keep doing this, they will becoming firmer and firmer.

I workout regularly so I figured I'd be ok with the second disc. I have been doing the second dvd for almost a month and I refuse to go on to the third one.  It kicks booty!  It never gets easy!

I'm working out more regularly now and learning to tone myself with this DVD. Now I do two segments of 20 minutes.  It was hard at first but I'm getting used to it. Very well done and it's working for me. She is talkative but funny and I don't mind it.

I would suggest starting with a lower weight (like 5 lb dumbbells or body bar) and then upping the weight...you will feel it!!!  I like that she does a lot of repetition because sometimes I feel like other tapes do some moves only a few times, and in order to reap the benefits of a sculpting move you need to repeat it.

4717082,5,B005KCIQQS,"So i tried this work out as a referral from my frien.  I was doing the Brazil Butt Lift at the time.  The Butt Bible video definitely exceeded my expectations.  Its my number one butt work out recommendation.  Especially because its broken down in 20, 30 and 40 minutes.  The Brazil Butt tells you to work 6 days a week.  Seriously?!  Who has that kind of time.  I think the Butt Bible brings in the hardest ones together for a GREAT workout, in a shorter time.  Then I ordered it for myself, then was presumptous and did 20 minutes first day, 30 minutes two days later then 40 minutes two day after.  I actually ended up pulling a muscle.  I would highly suggest stretching more (before and after) than she does in the video and pace yourself.  She mentions doing the 20 minutes for the first two weeks or until you feel comfortable.....take her advice.

4717092,4,B005KCIQQS,"I am in the midst of a glutorious transformation, it's true.

I have had this DVD set for several months and sporadically completed the level 1 lower body workout since purchasing it back in February, along with some other DVD workouts I had purchased.  However, after transitioning back into my job as a teacher in August, I stopped working out altogether.  (Evenings and weekends are pretty much exclusively for grading and planning.)

By the end of September, I was consistently experiencing the muscle aches, not of accomplishment, but of a sedentary lifestyle; I also was noticing a rather rapid sliding and melting of my already flat, though youthful, butt into my upper thighs (I could seriously feel the melting action just by walking around), so I decided to make this part of my day-to-day routine.  The levels range from 20-40 minutes (so basically a half-hour) a day, so I figured it's worth it for my health and sanity.  Since I hadn't moved in a very long time, I had to take a two-day break after my first lower body workout at the beginning of October.  Soreness!  (Even my boyfriend, the gym rat, said that it was a tough workout when he tried it with me one day).  But I'm on week 3 and have leveled up to level 2 now, and am glad to say that while I am not yet noticing a distinct VISIBLE difference, I can definitely FEEL the difference.  I feel my butt working to propel me as I walk and perform day-to-day activities, I feel my posture improving, and most notably, I feel an irrestible urge to grab my own butt as I walk around in the privacy of my apartment.  Why?  Because I feel MUSCLES in it!  Real, honest-to-goodness, non-mushy parts!  My quads have muscles, too!  This is exciting because I am accustomed to feeling nothing but skin and bone when I touch my leg, but now there's some actual cushion--and non-mushy cushion, at that--on the tops of my legs.

There's also an upper body workout, which works the arms, shoulders, and core.  It's great for alternating with lower-body days.  I'm still on level 1, and that's enough of a challenge for me at the moment, but I think between that and my Jackie Warner power circuit training upper body workout, I'm seeing some honest-to-goodness muscles in my arms, too. I am seriously getting stronger all over--the first time I tried the lower-body workout for level 2, I thought it would never end.  A couple of times I looked at her and said, ""You have got to be kidding.""  Of course, now I'm hanging in there with her and the girls, getting stronger and feeling better every day.

A lot of folks have complained about her constant chattiness (and it IS constant), but I rather like it.  She's quirky, and when she says to smile, I actually do it!  Her playful goofiness helps me to stay focused and motivated.

Oh, but sadness--I've read several folks complain about one of the DVD's not working after a few views, and I lament to tell you that it has happened to me as well.  Last week I put in my level 1 upper body workout, only to find that it started freezing during the warmup or shortly thereafter.  I had only done that workout 4 times.  I'm going to try it again, but I fear that what they say about the manufacturing error is true.  The workout is totally worth it, so maybe write down the moves if you want to replicate indefinitely, as these DVD's may not hang in there with you.

That said, do my butt and I regret my purchase?  Absolutely not!",1351036800,12,3433,4.517017828200973
4717093,4,B005KCIQQS,"This workout was surprisingly hard to complete initially, but after sticking with it I'm glad to say that i got complemented on my rear which was very satisfying. I read a couple reviews where people complained she talks to much, but I personally find it comical not annoying. She is downright offensive with some comments, but again I look at them for their humorous nature.

The workouts are easy to follow and the moves are pretty basic, but when you do them all circuit style you feel the burn! The only equipment necessary are dumbells, and a towel. The workouts progress every 2 weeks. Level 1, level 2 and level 3. You do each level for 2 weeks alternating upper and lower body workouts on different days. Level 1 is only 20 minutes for each segment, level 2 jumps to 30 mins, and level 3 is 40 minutes. You are supposed to do cardio 2 days- preferably on rest days and still fit in a full rest day to help your body recover.

For maximum results follow a low carb diet, drink plenty of water and also get plenty of rest. But most importantly stick to the workout and you'll achieve results!",1350345600,4,1098,4.430693069306931

4717100,5,B005KCIQQS,"This video is amazing, but not for your average joe. Pauline is hardcore- the videos are hardcore- the results are hardcore. I did the Brazilian Butt Lift series for 6 months before moving on to the Butt Bible. I thought those videos were hard, but as you do them you improve and you need a new challenge. I tried Butt Bible based off someone else's review on Amazon. It is by far the hardest workout video I own, I have about 30, and by far my favorite. The level 3 NEVER gets easy for me, no matter how many times I do it. Pauline does talk almost constantly, doesn't bother me, I'm grunting almost constantly,and I think she is hilarious. Plus if you are focusing on what she's saying, ""uh...you're not working out hard enough lady"". Do the 6 weeks, notice more muscle in your thighs and lifted butt, do it 12weeks- defined, muscular thighs, rock hard buns, plus nice arms if you do the upper body. This is not much of an ab or cardio video- but who cares? I have other videos for that! I recommend Butt Bible alternating workouts 6days/wk and a cardio with it like Jillians, or the 10Day to a Better Body. BTW- Jillian Micheals has nothing on Pauline!
Tip: when your legs get really painful and burning- just look at Pauline and pretend her legs are yours....always helps me push through. :)",1345334400,42,1295,4.445378151260504

4717103,5,B005KCIQQS,"Pauline is definitely quirky, but her workouts are VERY effective.  All 3 DVDs have both lower and upper body workouts.

I started seeing results after just 2 weeks with the lower body workout, which inspired me to do the upper body workouts as well.  I thought the workouts were fun and the time goes by quickly.  Butt the results are what keep me going!!!

Update 10/19/12:  After doing Butt Bible 3 every other day for several months, my buns are in the best shape ever.  I've now returned to getting much more diligent about doing the upper body workout as well.

4717105,4,B005KCIQQS,"i was looking for a dvd that specifically focused on the rear and thought, ""a name like butt bible? surely it must work...""  just a note: originally, i was blessed genetically with a pretty nice butt and didn't have to work hard to keep it that way other than doing pilates.  however my rear was deflated after i dealt with an illness and lost too much weight (both fat and muscle tone).  suddenly, as pauline says, i had a flabby dried raisin butt :(

i'm still on level 1, so i can't comment further than the first disc.  i'd say the dvd is close to perfect, but not quite for one reason: pauline doesn't give you proper verbal instruction on setting up moves.  you are expected to know proper squat format (which is not easy), etc.  she also tends to go pretty fast from one set to the next,  to the point that i had to pause the dvd to adjust myself in order to catch up at times (but again, i'm still a beginner).  however, if done properly, you can definitely feel your butt muscles the next day.

unlike other reviewers, i find pauline to be very funny, likable and genuine.  if she was dull and humorless, it would be hard to stick to the dvd because it isn't exactly exciting or pleasurable squeezing your rear for 25 minutes.  if pauline made a 2nd version of this dvd set with more specific instruction on positioning i'd totally buy it.",1341964800,2,1348,4.348
4717106,5,B005KCIQQS,"I'll start off by saying I was a certified personal trainer in a gym for powerlifters for about 7 years (I am a female), so I know a lot about working out. When I ended up going to college and working insane hours I slowed down, which led to stopping, which led to flab. Ive been unhappy with myself for years but it's SO difficult to get back into when you feel so horrible about your body. I saw these videos on Comcast and fell in love and bought them here. Phase 1 was a little too easy for me so I moved right to phase 2 which was pretty killer, and I stuck to that for 3 weeks. I remember CLEARLY one day after two weeks getting out of the bath and drying my legs of and just stopped cold and thought OMG I FEEL MUSCLE!! I did level 2, 4 days a week for 2 weeks when I saw that difference. After 5 weeks and moving onto level 3 I was down a jean size!! I am telling you, this is THE workout to get!! She is tough and motivates you to keep going right when you feel like giving up. I know a lot of people are saying that her personality gets on their nerves. I personally love it and think she is hysterical and really..does it matter what she is even saying???? Her words aren't giving you a toned body, her WORKOUT is.

You will not see results if after your workout you go get some fast food for a reward and drink a 6 pack of soda a day, no workout will. Dedicate yourself to this and believe in yourself and think that just in a few short weeks you can look in the mirror and be amazed at how happy and strong you feel, and look! I am addicted to this workout and cannot wait until she releases more. So many workouts I have tried with no results but this one was SO quick!

4717108,5,B005KCIQQS,"I've never done workout DVD's until this one. My butt has always been round, but EXTREMELY jiggly. No muscle at all. Let me tell you, the Butt Bible has changed that completely. My butt has gotten much smoother, perkier, and rounder, and I love it. I still get sore after doing it for 6 weeks. My arms are also in the best shape they've ever been in. I never did the abs routine (substituted P90X ab ripper instead), but it seems effective. Only thing- no cardio segment to this for your off days. While the Butt Bible gets your heart rate pumping, I wish Pauline offered a fun routine for the off days. It's hard to motivate yourself to run sometimes. Anyway, I strongly encourage this DVD!! It's really toned me from head to toe.",1340236800,2,731,4.4222222222222225
4717109,1,B005KCIQQS,In the past I have bought Pauline's e books and I have followed her on the internet. I think she has a lot of knowledge about how to work out and lifting weights. So I was surprised with this video it's a basic class room work out. I felt like I wasted my money. This video has knocked my option of Pauline down a couple of notches.,1339718400,8,332,3.970149253731343
4717110,5,B005KCIQQS,I'm a personal trainer and I'm really happy that there's a least one DVD that I find hard for the first time at level 3. I did yesterday and I find it hard on level 3 and sometimes I have to take a break. So good for the glute. Congratulations Pauline and thanks for your helpul comments.,1339718400,,288,4.0701754385964914
4717111,3,B005KCIQQS,"If you've ever worked out before, you've done everything in this series! It's just a combination of a lot of things that have been done before and really you don't need an instructor for these moves. In my opinion, if you already have even a small collection of workout videos, this will not be any great addition for you. Level one didn't give me any sort of challenge at all. If you are just beginning to add fitness into your life, this is a good foundation for glute toning, but don't look for anything new here.",1338595200,,516,4.385416666666667
4717112,5,B005KCIQQS,I did some of her videos on Demand for free. Love her personality and motivation. When I couldn't get it free anymore. I purchased it and have no regrets. I feel better at 40 then I did at 30. No stressful or too long. A Must Have!,1338422400,,231,3.9361702127659575
4717113,5,B005KCIQQS,This is the first workout that focuses on the butt alone.  All the other workouts I've tried said they workout the butt but they include workouts for the arms and abs and everything else.  If your focus is the butt then this is the workout for you.  It is the only workout you will ever need.  After doing level one I tossed out all the other dvds and I only use this one.  Pauline is the best!!!,1337385600,,396,4.090909090909091
4717114,5,B005KCIQQS,"This is the second set of DVDS I have purchased. I wore out the first ones! The third disc still kicks my butt.  I can perform these workouts anywhere.  I feel it the next day so I know that it works.  Others have commented by asking me what I have been doing because I look different, but don't quite know what it is!  My clothes fit better too.  The moves are not difficult but effective.",1337212800,,390,4.1466666666666665
4717115,5,B005KCIQQS,"""This is how we are love making the butt""...says Pauline.  I love these videos.  My glutes are a problem area for me; genetically speaking I am not gifted in this department.  I have a natural ""mom butt"" and at 36 it has been slowly sliding down the back of my thighs for several years now.  I've worked out off and on for most of my life, but have never found anything other than hitting the squat rack consistently at the gym that will seem to do much about my posterior situation.

That is, until the Butt Bible!  There's really nothing that different or magical about what Pauline is doing, it's just that as she says, it's nothing new but it works.  The way she strings the exercises together, the pace, and I honestly think most of all her incessant chatter is key to the success of the program.  There have been reviews that have docked her for talking too much throughout, but I for one find it quite entertaining.  Furthermore, if you listen to what she is saying, most of it revolves around what part of the body you're working at the moment - which focuses the mind - basically putting the mind into the muscle and making the workout much more effective!

I can't say enough great things about this set!  You won't regret purchasing and if you're consistent about doing the Butt Bible you WILL see great results!",1335830400,10,1323,4.470833333333333
4717116,4,B005KCIQQS,"I have only recently started working on this series but the exercises though not fancy really hit the spot! Pauline is VERY chatty and I can see why her constant verbal stream might be offputting for some but I thought she was hilarious and had some real LOL moments while doing the workout. IMHO that is a plus..
More relevantly, you get a whole body toning session that wakes up muscles that (for me at least) have been long dormant, although I am fairly fit.
if you really struggle with the talking, you can mute it but don't miss out on this one. The exercises are well put together and effective!",1335139200,,601,4.423423423423423
4717117,3,B005KCIQQS,"I like this workout dvd. Its to the point and it does get you going and offers a good workout.

4717118,5,B005KCIQQS,I got this for a good lower body workout that works. Judging by the reviews and for the price I decided to buy it. As soon as it came in the mail I started the workout. I loved how it was simple moves all but one move I seen before and believe me that one move that was new to me was the hardest! I'm on level one right now and after just two workouts my I can see my lower body tighting and toning out! I admit to some of the other reviews she talked alot. So I just turned the volume off and listened to my music or the radio. I loved how quick the workout was done and how sore I was after just 20 minutes. I'm going to keep at the program for I'm excited to see the end results after a month and a half! So for anyone whether male or female wants a good straight to the point lower body workout that works I would say try this and for the price you can't beat it!,1334620800,,867,3.769230769230769
4717119,3,B005KCIQQS,"I only did the butt workouts and only the level 3 so I can only judge that specific portion. I'm in good shape and lift weights plenty so I just wanted something to have at home as a substitute workout when I couldn't get to the gym. It served its purpose but I don't think it will in any way transform me. I would have expected more out of Pauline but while she is in great shape, she is probably not the best person to do a workout video. She talked way too much and her voice can be annoying. She is great to look at for motivation though. If you are new to working out, this will definitely teach you a few moves and make you feel a burn. For those that are a little more advanced, it's probably just a quick workout but won't leave you sore but it is probably okay every now and then, along with your other workouts.",1334534400,3,821,4.042944785276074
4717120,5,B005KCIQQS,"LOVE IT! I am 5'2 and when I started this dvd I was 195 pounds and stuck at a weight loss plateau.  I am a pretty active woman; I do at least an hour a day of cardio and Les Mills Body Pump 3 times a week but my butt and thighs have always been trouble spots for me.  I'm three weeks into the program and down 7 pounds and I have lost 2 inches around each of my thighs. I have noticeably less cellulite and my butt is smaller and firmer.  I do Butt Bible 5 days a week and it is so worth it! Even though I only loss 7 pounds I am a whole jean size smaller.  The results make the hard work worth it.
The dvds are tough and that's coming from someone who is used to doing wieghted lunges and squats for 5 minutes at a time. I read the reviews before buying and there were a lot of people who were not a fan of Pauline because of her voice or how much she talks.  She certainly is not quiet but I do think she incredibly funny and motivating.  I've watched the dvds dozens of times and still laugh every time she says something like ""I might be from Sweeden but I'm not stupid!""  I think she is great!  You definitely won't regret buying Butt Bible.",1334016000,13,1146,3.9094827586206895
4717121,4,B005KCIQQS,"Like so many other reviewers, I tried out the Butt Bible Lower body workout on a free trial on ""On Demand"" and loved it.  I bought the dvd and was pleasantly surprised to find out that the upper body workouts were just as effective as the lower body workouts. I like to do the workouts as an addition to cardio (Zumba, treadclimber, walking). Only problem is that I am an ex basketball player and have suffered knee injuries and resulting arthritis over the last few years.  It has not helped that I had 2 children back to back and gained a considerable amount of weight during the pregnancies that worsened some of my knee issues.  As I am losing weight the knees are improving, but deep lunges, squats and step ups can present a challenge.  Nevertheless, I continue to do a modified version of the exercises and have seen amazing results! My husband can't stop commenting on the change!

My only criticism is that the instruction on form and technique are lacking and there is no modified version for people who have lower back or knee injuries to follow.  If you are an experienced exerciser/athlete then you usually know how to make modifications for your injuries.  But if you are not , this could present a barrier to acheiving your maximum results.  Pauline's constant chatter doesn't phase me as I encounter people with worse dialogue and comments during the course of my work day so it takes alot to offend me!

Overall , I highly reccommend the Butt Bible for anyone who is trying to reshape their lower body, especially if you have had 2 or more children in a short period of time.",1332892800,2,1592,4.577464788732394

I am very happy with Pauline's instruction performances. She explains everything, and let me tell you- these routines are hard. She is excellent at keeping you finishing the whole routine. I am glad I purchased it! Without a proper diet you will not succeed with any tapes no matter how often you do them! Don't kid yourself!

I had been doing the workout on demand at home so when I ordered the DVDs I started at level 2 I only used it about 5 times and now it won't play. I have tried it on different devices so I know that's not it. For as much money as I paid I'm angry it broke.  no matter how good the workout it's useless if it won't play!,1331337600,3,486,3.6285714285714286

I also do cardio along w/it, but man, she kicks my butt!  One poster said it hurts so good, I would definitely second that statement.",1330646400,7,508,4.651685393258427
4717130,5,B005KCIQQS,"Wow!! This workout is amazing!! I don't use it alone, I have many home workout DVD's but I find this to be an amazing weight training DVD. And I like how when your working lower body thats all your working and the same goes for the upper body sections. I like to alternate workouts so im not putting too much strain on any one group day after day. Don't get me wrong I love my Jillian Michaels DVD's but they are very intense all over body workout so makes it hard to single out an area for each day. I do one of these Butt Bible workouts at least 3 times a week, tho sometimes more. I have seen amazing results so far in my butt. I am a person who has been working out 3-6 days a week for years now and was never happy with my butt.... I figured, oh well I guess it's just my genes..... but guess what!! I was wrong because I have a butt now! I always had a flat butt before and now I love my butt! I have never had so much fun trying on pants! And the muscle definition I have gained in my legs and arms is very sexy!! I would recommend this system to anybody! and I do. And I guess some people find the chic annoying but I find her funny and the workout is so worth it!!

4717132,5,B005KCIQQS,"This is my favorite exercise video because the instructor makes butt comments through the entire routine. She says ""butt"" about a million times and constantly keeps your focus on the fact that the reason you are doing this is for a good butt. Straight and simple and sassy. At one point, she says pilates is a joke. Sometimes she says ""crack the nuts."" Maybe it comes across as funny and fresh because she isn't quite the typical drill master. She's got a feminine appeal and a foreign accent. It's a video and you can hit the pause button to go get a drink of water. Still, unlike some other videos, I come back for more because she keeps it real. She says all the time how much she loves the butt and how you should love your butt, too. Eventually it seems entirely normal to be killing yourself in your living room doing butt moves. I love the focus and I'm so glad I didn't get an all-body DVD. With this one, I know exactly what the deal is - do the moves, work the butt, wear the bikini.",1330560000,4,993,4.2592592592592595

When I get to the point when I'm ""done"" with the DVD, (another week and a half, then it's time to move on) I'll tack one of the three levels on to whatever other lower body workout I'm doing.

This is one of my most favorite because it spends so much time on just one body area, it is very effective.  However, all three discs skipped to the point that some of them were unwatchable.  It's very frustrating to do a workout DVD that pauses and skips continuously.  I sent back the first set of discs (so grateful I bought them on Amazon.com and could exchange them at no charge!!).  The second set I received was just as bad, maybe even identical.  I had the same experience with the Incredible Abs videos I bought, also from Exercise TV.

Try it, it works wonder!

March 2012: now I am at level 2. But I had to request a refund for the following reasons:
Amazon sent this to me in a very hard to open package. And inside the packaging, these are what you might receive:
- One part of the case was broken, the case does not function properly so the Disc 1 and 2 were hanging out and not stick to the case!
- Disc 2 stops half-way when I was doing workout. It also has stains on it the 1st time I looked at.
- Disc 3 I has not used yet but there were already scratches on it.

I was very jiggly before I started this and it has firmed me up a lot. However you have to do it at least every other day to see results.

I go to the gym a lot and thought I had a pretty strong lower body but these videos proved me wrong.  The exercises are intense and cause you to work the muscles to exhaustion, which seems to be the secret to results.  People complain about Pauline, the instructor... she is rather quirky and does say odd things (talks to her butt like it's a male person), but she keeps up an impressive stream of chatter throughout the video which helped distract me from the pain.  I found her prattle quite helpful, and as for the exercises, well... I have more muscle tone in my thighs and a rounder shape to my butt, so it's clearly worked for me.  I think it made my jeans size go up one, but only b/c I have so much more muscle now.

I am not trying to lose my butt instead i wanted to shape it up. There is a noticable lift to my bottom and it is appearing more round and bigger. I would recommend this to any lady.

 I was addicited to butt bible from exercise tv I love it and her attitude is hilarious she is so motivating, yes she is a little out there but she knows her stuff and these videos will never get old if I don't do this for a week and then go back to it it kicks my butt and I know its working. its not one of those fluffy videos that don't do anything.

After doing this program I noticed more definition in my arms and my butt was firmer and smaller. One bad thing about this video is that she sometimes doesn't do the same amount of reps on both sides. You may want to count how many reps she does manually like I did, just to be sure you do the same number on both sides. I was also a little disappointed in the abs section in the Upper Body Level 3 workout, it was long and didn't feel challenging enough so I eventually just stopped doing it altogether.

She includes abs in all 3 upper body workouts. The level 3 workouts are probably the best ones! I will definately miss doing The Butt Bible, and I seriously recommend this DVD to anyone looking to get in shape in 6 weeks time. It is very challenging (all 3 levels), and be prepared to do a literal MARATHON of reps, but it will be worth it in the end.

I am 29 year old mother of 2 I am 5'7, 157 lbs. Last year, I decided to join a gym and even got a personal trainer for 8 sessions. Between, the monthly membership fees, the rates of a personal trainer, and just actually having to go to the gym (when working full time and being a parent), it was not feasible for me. This video is like having your own personal trainer at the comfort of your own living room. Her videos are doable for anyone. Even the 20 min videos will leave you sore for days. I don't believe the results you get within a couple of weeks. I saw an improvement in myself faster than what I did when i was hitting the gym. The price is affordable. The convenience of doing it in your home is amazing. And once you see the results, the way you feel when you put on your favorite jeans, the way your confidence boosts and your attitude transforms, it is priceless. Plus the things she says in her videos are so entertaining, you can't help but laugh. Go and make a $20 investment on yourself. You will not be disappointed.",1327104000,,1170,4.18141592920354

So I saw someone's amazing results after just a few weeks doing this video set and I decided to give it a try. Only on week one of level 2 but already I am starting to see some results. My ultimate goal is to get rid of the jiggle and cellulite that make me feel uncomfortable wearing shorter shorts and swimsuits. It's only January and if this trims down even half of what I'd like to get rid of, I'd be thrilled. I'll try to update this once I have all 6 weeks done.
Also I should add that I have only done the upper body workout once so far as that's not my main focus and I lift weights at the gym, but even level 1 is a good workout for my arms and abs.

Update: after completing the 6 weeks, I definitely see some lifting and trimming happening for my butt and hips, but still have some toning to do. I plan to keep working through levels 2 and 3 every week til I get even better results.

4717160,3,B005KCIQQS,"I bought this dvd from exercisetv when I first heard it was coming out. I've known about Pauline Nordin and I've seen her in ads and articles in muscle magazines for years and years now. Knowing that she was a serious fitness professional, I was excited to get a real workout to give my backside a boost. She delivers.

I've only done the lower body segments of the dvds and I wasn't sure how the level 1 dvd's would fair for me considering I have a pretty strong lower body but they still had me breaking a sweat, although I was never sore after any of the workouts. From what I recall you don't need any materials for the level one dvd. I did this program twice a week for two weeks.

For week 3, I moved up to level 2. The level 2 really steps it up and you are constantly moving. All you need for this one is some dumbbells. I did this twice a week for two weeks as well. After the four weeks I had already seen some noticable results.

I put in the level 3 dvd and was suddenly extremely disappointed. You need a chair, a barbell and dumbbells. I don't have a barbell or a suitable chair so I haven't got to do this dvd at all. I didn't see anywhere on the dvd case or the website that said what materials I'd need so that sort of bummed me out considering I had been sticking to it so well.

After that I've just used the level 1 and 2 dvd's for days when I can't get the motivation to go to the gym.

As far as the overall feel of the dvds, they aren't exactly fun, but working out hardly ever is. Pauline can be a little confusing. ""Ok one more set!"" then you do it but then she has you do another one... just weird things like that. She is forever talking. Some of the things being said are unintentionally hilarious, by the way. You kind of tune it out after one or two watches.

The girls in the background are just smiling drones that sort of creeped me out, but that's not quite relevant.

So long as you have the materials for this dvd and are consistant with it, you will see results! And that's what we are all after right?",1326240000,20,2039,4.0825

I completed the 6 weeks regiment and beyond! It hurt so good! I could see and feel the results by the second week as well as my hubby. It was recommended 4 days a week, I didn't hear or know that..so I was doing it as many as 6-7 days a week I believe that's why the accelerated results! I love how she focuses on the lower for a week and upper for another! Great S.T. & cardio, u feel strong...no you feel like a bad ass like Pauline says! Yes, she does talk a lot, 'butt' I found it funny as well as great entertainment during a hardcore workout- kinda motivational! I didn't take things offensively 'ass' I attributed to her English as her second language and she didn't mean how it came out or sounded.
If you want results and want to feel good doing it, I highly recommend BB! I used BB as a compliment to my other workouts I do at the gym (Zumba, spin, weight training, kickboxing, boot camps & step), I treated it as my bonuses or treat! I had to breakdown and buy it after its trial viewing ending from Comcast/Xfinity as this is something I had to have & continue! Once I completed the initial 6 weeks I've started to do each level for 3-4 days. I prefer levels 2 & 3 'butt' if short on time I'll do level 1! There are no excuses b/c once u start u will know its a butt right! Count down to your great 'glutorious' adventure!

U get results...my mantra for 2012 is Believe! 'Butta' believe results will happen with the butt bible! Know the Commandments and see as well feel the results. Pauline is motivational and funny. Great for a kickass workout!

All play on my computer dvd player...but I don't have room there. That is also the case with the Slimdown. My dvd player is not new, but one disc does work and ""disk is dirty"" comes up with all the others that are brand new. All the discs work with my computer dvd, but skip the more I play them.

4717168,5,B005KCIQQS,"This dvd set is a must-have for anyone looking for incredible results for every problem area I have.  Pauline's upper and lower body workouts are fun (and she is very funny too) but you will feel and see the results by following her routine workout. I am 55 years old and have not worked out regularly for more than 10 years; although weight gain has never been an issue for me, I was very out of shape and ""jiggly"" in the legs, butt, and arms. I had never worked with dumbells before, and began with a 3 lb. set.  Pauline's workouts are tough, but not too difficult to do once you adapt to the pace and workout.  I started with Level 1 and stayed with it for longer than the recommended 2 weeks before moving up to Level 2. After about 3-4 weeks, I moved up to Level 2 (both upper and lower) and stayed there for another 3-4 weeks.  I am almost ready to move to Level 3, but again want to go at my own pace because some of the moves seem too challenging for me.  Doing Pauline's workouts have drastically improved my posture, strength, stamina and overall shape.  I went from a size 8 to a 6 (which is where I was 10 years ago) and look better in a dress that I have in 20 years.  This workout is not for sissies -- but if you want to really get results and transform the cottage cheese thighs and butt and lose jello arm fat -- this workout can't be beat.",1323648000,95,1357,4.117424242424242
4717169,5,B005KCIQQS,"I have read many reviews about this product and got the impression that this trainer is hit/miss with most. Either you love her style, or you hate it. It's that simple. Because of the polarity of the reviews, I decided to rent an episode and try it out first. I'm glad I did, because this woman is exactly what I wanted for this type of a work out. I don't like overly peppy instructors and I don't like instructor that are silent throughout, b/c I can always write down the moves and do it on my own. I take the time to watch the DVDs specifically to hear the encouragement to keep going, keep focused. So it's all about what you need from an instructor and what you respond to the best. Pauline is really great at what she does and I was especially pleased about the bonus upper body and lower body that is included in these routines.

I usually don't like to separate my workouts to upper/lower or cardio/weight dichotomy and prefer to do a bit of both in most of my workouts. My schedule is so hectic that although I may have plans to follow the next day with a specific workout, there is no guarantee that I will have dedicated time to it. Well, I don't want to do a flimsy upper body routine that is short, abrupt and doesn't make me sore the next day. So this comprehensive workout it is just right for me.

I am very big on finding the goldilocks balance in trainers. Think about a dance instructor. Is everyone going to like every dance instructor? No, because the type of communication and style of teaching (verbal, visual, or mix) makes a tremendous difference for me. So it's all about trying to see if the style fits your personality. I tried 4 different Zumba instructors and was ready to call it quits and then I found exactly what worked for me. So I hope this review helps.",1323216000,8,1791,4.343283582089552

It only took me getting to the 2nd disk to see real results. If you use good form and you push yourself through the exercises- you will see amazing results. You do have to be in somewhat good shape to complete these workouts. I would not recommend this to someone just starting out. You are doing many squats, more than 30 at a time and in sets of 3. I gave this a five star because of the effectiveness but if I had to rate the instructor, she would get a 3. She is pretty and her body is beautiful however the tone of her voice, her accent and the annoying way she instructs you could prompt you to jump from a high building.

These dvds are unrealiable and NOT DVDS AT ALL.  It is a DVR. Which is a low quality cd that is mostly compatible with your computer rather than your dvd player. I had purchased this through Exercise Tv and it only plays on my computer. This has more to do with the manufacturer & pauline nordin than with the seller (aka amazon or exercise tv).

Which is too bad because the workouts are really good. If you buy it from Exercise TV or Pauline Nordin, don't expect customer service.

My only OTHER thing I would improve on is when you get the dvd, you get a very simple pamphlet about meal plans. I wish it was more detailed. I felt a little lost about what to eat.

Just wondering where people bought this because mine looked like a cat scratched it up--not once, but twice. That does not affect my review at all but wondering if this was a factory defect or what!

But yes, i tried all of these On-Demand. Initially the commentary by Pauline was funny, but after awhile u are tired of hearing ""this is how we make love to the butt"" and how everyone in the world needs a butt like hers. Lets fact it, genetics play a huge role in this as well, so even if u have a ""flat yoga butt"" u aren't going to inflate it to be ""two cherries"" like Madison's doing this workout.

Great workout though. Repetition definitely plays a huge role in changing your body and there is plenty of that. Will definitely give u results if you work at it.

4717179,3,B005KCIQQS,"As a half-Italian female, I've always struggled with my lower half and am always on the lookout for workouts that will shape up my trouble spots.  In the past, I've had really good results with Beachbody's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazil-Butt-Lift/dp/B00337MOMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazil Butt Lift</a>, but have done it so many times that I wanted something new.  More recently, I did Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric program, and, while I had great results from her system, I had to stop after 42 days since it was causing me a lot of back pain. I picked up the Butt Bible since it had good reviews here and elsewhere.

So far, I'm only on my second week, and it's already giving me results.  I'm an advanced exerciser, though, so the first level was too easy (even with adding weights), so I moved on to Level 2 after just a week of Level 1.

While these exercises are effective and will definitely tone up problem areas, the instructor's incessant chatter is driving me a bit nutso already.  I usually have a fairly high tolerance for chatter on DVDs (for instance, I find Tanya Becker on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Physique-57-Workout-Kit-3-Disc-Set-with-Exercise-Ball/dp/B005H0GLOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Physique 57 Workout Kit 3 Disc Set with Exercise Ball</a>&nbsp;workouts to be amusing), but Pauline in the Butt Bible talks non-stop -- to the point where it's really annoying. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but I think that this is her first workout DVD and so she thought that she had to talk the whole time, instead of realizing that it's OK to have quiet moments.  I wish the.director had told her while filming that she could have some ""down time"" in her comments.

If Pauline had given more form pointers, I think that the talking wouldn't bother me as much, but a lot of the talk is repetitive about how great the Butt Bible is, and some of it is a bit offensive (such as when she compares muscles to ""starving children"" or talks about how ""flat yoga butt"" is an ""epidemic"").  Concentrating more on correct form and position and having more reminders about these aspects would have made these workouts a lot more effective.

I think that I will end up muting the TV and listening to my own music if I decide to stick with these.  I'll update my review if I do stick them out for a few more weeks.

UPDATE ON 6/8/12:  In the May/June 2012 issue of _Muscle and Fitness Hers_ magazine, there is a butt Q&A with Pauline that is really helpful.  In the interview, she states that she herself works her glutes for at least an hour two times per week.  She goes on to say that she does the Level 3 workout from this series, but with lower reps and higher weights.  I'd love to see her do a second DVD series with that level of workout -- and less chatter!  ;-)",1319500800,197,2906,4.98343685300207

Not for those who don't want to swear, curse and burn!",1317772800,10,381,4.701492537313433

4717184,5,B005KCIQQS,"Ive been luck enough to get the series on my ondemand for free so I am hoping that i will be able to finish the series out before they take it off. I wrote down the exercises done and the reps so if is taken off, i have an outline of the exercises and do it without the video. I am on level 2 right now and i can tell you, i curse at this chick everytime i workout even when i was at level 1! This is a true hardcore workout and they don't get easy but if you have drive you'll be more than happy with the results. She has me sweating and my lower half is pretty fatigued when im done and the rest in between the next workout is just enough for me to recovery for the next workout. I don't do the upper body program because i work that out all the time in the gym I have a nice butt already but i like to build more muscle on it and keep it up. My b/f loves my butt and i can tell its working because he's all over me!!",1316649600,7,919,3.693877551020408

8476729,5,B005KCIQQS,These exercises REALLY work! Im 67 years old! Used it before & wore out the DVD & has to purchase another! My perky butt was starting to go flat! My Daughter gave me a copy of the Butt Biiblle (hated the name because Im a Christian so I almost didn't use it! ) but it worked really well! Within the first month I could tell the difference! When Ive stopped for a while (because of illness) I noticed  it doesnt take long for my muscles to remember & get back in shape! You won't be disappointed if you actually DO the exercises!,1522713600,,528,4.176470588235294
8476730,2,B005KCIQQS,I saw no noticeable difference from this workout. I was actually bored and I found the instructor's voice to be annoying.,1516665600,,121,4.809523809523809

8476732,1,B005KCIQQS,"This is probably the least polished workout DVD I have ever done. Low production quality (she makes obvious mistakes in the order of her exercises) and music is terrible. The models in the back have awful form (watch them doing push ups!) and no personality. But the way Pauline babbles on incessantly about literally NOTHING drives me crazy. She slams other workouts as being a joke. Yoga and Pilates are boring and a joke.  Really? Tell that to a yogi. Offensive. Her workouts are effective- of course you will see definition if you do squats and lunges for 30 min- but basic and boring. I will stick to Tracy Anderson and Tony Horton. Next to this workout, Beachbody programs are blockbusters.",1509321600,3,696,4.75206611570248
8476733,5,B005KCIQQS,"Excellent workout!  Great results!  I love this DVD and Pauline is pretty entertaining.  When it comes to squats, this workout is not for the faint of heart.  This DVD doesn't just focus on the butt however, its a full body workout and a GOOD one!  I swear by it.  If you do this workout properly and faithfully, you will see results! I bought this DVD years ago and am still using it today, its great!",1506643200,,402,4.293333333333333

8476736,5,B005KCIQQS,"Haven't tried level 2 yet, I wanted an hour long workout so I did 1 and 3. 1 is a great warmup, not hard at all. I didn't add weights with that one because I wanted to go heavy with level 3. Dear lord, is level 3 a challenge. If you are using weights that are heavy for you in this workout, you will die. I hit failure multiple times and had to pause the dvd. I would really recommend getting a bar like she uses. I don't have one, and used dumbbells the whole time. It gets very taxing on your arms to hold heavy dumbbells throughout the whole workout, even if you drop them for a break after each set. Great workout, and a great coach as well, very encouraging.",1503878400,,663,4.03030303030303
