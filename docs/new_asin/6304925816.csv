7881091,5,6304925816,"(Roscoe) FATTY ARBUCKLE and nephew AL ST. JOHN were early Mack Sennett stock players. Both were Keystone Kops. Charismatic Fatty had his own comedy series with Mabel Normand. The less-talented Al did a lot of gawping and jumping in the air.

(Joseph) BUSTER KEATON (Jr.) debuted on-screen in Fatty's first independent short, ""The Butcher Boy."" Keaton soon surpassed his mentor in comedic inventiveness, and was given artistic control of the studio when Arbuckle left to make features. Fatty's failure at these and the accidental death of an actress during a 1921 Labor Day party held at his hotel suite effectively ended Arbuckle's career.

The six shorts on SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA VOL. 4 include an early Keystone co-starring Chaplin, a ""Mabel & Fatty,"" one that stars all three actors, a Comique Arbuckle & Keaton, a Keaton solo film and a St. John comedy directed by Uncle Roscoe.

SYNOPSES--

THE ROUNDERS--  Chaplin and Arbuckle are two tipplers who live in adjacent apartments. The intoxicated men go home to exasperated wives and when the women meet and feud in the hall, Fatty and Charley sneak off to Smith's Cafe, where they cause a scene. The wives follow them there. The drunks flee to a nearby park, hop in a rowboat and fall asleep. An angry crowd on shore yells as the boat slowly fills with water and sinks.

FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT--  Dubbed from an original print that employs imaginative tinting. Pink, orange, green, yellow, lavender, light blue, blue, blue gray, brown and red are all used. In one yellow-tinted scene, Mabel blows out an oil lamp and the color instantly shifts to orange. PLOT: The seaside home of newlyweds is washed into the ocean (with the help of a hateful rival (St. John).

OH DOCTOR--  While Dr. Arbuckle calls on a crook's ""sick"" wife, the villain (St. John) visit's the doc's home and snatches Mrs. Fatty's necklace without her knowledge. Junior (Keaton) calls the cops as Fatty chases St. John over rooftops.

THE GARAGE--  Superb short is divided in three sections: (1.) Inept mechanics (Fatty and Buster) get grease all over themselves, the boss's daughter and her boyfriend Jim who's nattily dressed in tweed jacket and white trousers. (2.) Keaton loses his pants and dons a paper kilt and tam cut out of a billboard. (3.) Fatty and Buster are also failures as volunteer firemen. They rush (in a fashion) to the garage that Jim accidentally sets ablaze to rescue him and girlfriend.

THE BOAT--  While removing his newly built yacht (the DAMFINO) from the garage, Buster's home collapses. When it's launched with a coke bottle christening, the boat sinks. Eventually, Buster, wife and two small kids go for a cruise. A violent storm at sea founders the yacht and they escape to an impossbly tiny life boat. Short includes such sightgags as a rubbery spyglass, a pancake used to patch a hull leak and an anchor that floats! Intertitles have original artwork. First half dubbed from scratchy film with faded sections.

THE IRON MULE--  Al St. John comedy directed by the exiled Arbuckle. Set in 1830, Al is conductor on a train of two stagecoaches hitched to a primitive steam engine. After floating across a river by lashing logs to the train, they're set upon by Indians (led by Keaton in cameo). Passengers and crew escape, clinging to the engine after abandoning the other cars.

7881092,5,6304925816,"This collection focuses on the artistry and influence of Fatty Arbuckle, especially on Buster Keaton. There was clearly a lot of thought that went into the selection of the films to include in this set, and the payoff, as in pairing food and wine, is in bringing out a better appreciation of each piece.  For example, The Iron Mule, a rarely seen, and not very funny, starring vehicle for Al St. John, is nonetheless more entertaining when you see the influence of both Keaton and Arbuckle (who wrote and directed it after his scandal left him unemployable as an actor) on the content.

The earliest film of the collection is Fatty and Mabel Adrift (1916), perhaps the best of the sweet, romantic comedies Arbuckle made with Mabel Normand for Mack Sennett. Their onstage chemistry is simply amazing; they move and flow naturally together into visual humor or romantic encounters, making mundane tasks like milking a cow or having dinner together both funny and touching. Al St. John, the perennial nemesis, is a sort of cross between redneck rube and urban punk. He is often over-the-top in gesture and response, but at other times he is both funny and convincing in his role as crazed heavy. Arbuckle can be appreciated for bringing refinement and better story-telling into the Keystone studio; his films for Keystone are typically the most fascinating to watch.  This movie is an under-appreciated masterpiece; its humor is as satisfying to the modern viewer as to the viewer in 1916.

The collection also has two Keaton-Arbuckle pairings during Buster's early career. The contrast between the earlier one, Oh Doctor (1917), and the last one they made together, The Garage (1919) shows how far along Keaton's character developed under Arbuckle -- the Garage is as much a Keaton-style film as Arbuckle's.

The other masterpiece in the collection is The Boat (1921), made after Keaton and Arbuckle split ways. On one level, it is the story of a family ruined by nature, machine, and questionable decision-making by the father (Buster). Virtually all of the humor is based on futile attempts by ""the little man"" to control uncontrollable forces, including gravity and a furious storm. Extremely funny little moments abound in this movie, as when the life preserver sinks in the water, while, later on in the movie the anchor is seen to float! The entire film, like many of Keaton's short films of the period, have a dark undercurrent; it's possible to feel moments of sympathy for the poor family while you are laughing at the demise of their property. Like all of Keaton's best films, the theme, visual humor, and moods of this one are completely unique and original.

The producers of this collection should be commended for their thoughtfulness and dedication. The background music accompanying the films is also good, and the quality of the prints is as good as you can get.",1148083200,,2877,4.933884297520661
