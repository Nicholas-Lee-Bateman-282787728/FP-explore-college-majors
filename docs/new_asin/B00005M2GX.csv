He did not have the loudest or heaviest voice, only an astoundingly gorgeous one, and so sang little grand opera. The two operatic arias on this video from my dearly beloved Voice of Firestone radio and television programs are magnificent and it would be difficult to find them sung better. He sings a Schubert song wonderfully. I love Schubert and he is one of my favorite composers. He would have loved this performance.

Mr. Thomas sang many songs loved by audiences of the forties and fifties, some rarely heard today, such as Welsh and Scottish folk songs, sung so movingly they can bring tears to the eyes, operetta songs not heard today but rousing delights, and several still loved songs by Rogers and Hammerstein. I have heard ""Some Enchanted Evening"" sung by everybody, and never better than this rendition. This is total happiness from beginning to end. Cloud 9 territory.",1362009600,,1031,4.824858757062147

Mr. Thomas' clear, commanding voice left an unforgettable impression on my, and caused me to ""seek out"" works of this great Opera Singer 50 years later.  I was delighted to find this video tape, which I've purchased and listened to time and time again.  I'va also shared it with my Father - Dr. G. William Jones, who well remembers the importance of music to the Welsh.  A ""must buy"" for all of Welsh Decendance, and all who appreciate fine Opera presented in a contemporary setting.",1227398400,,638,4.7207207207207205
