Jill is a creator of complex and versatile emotions which she protrayed very provacotively as a murder victim helpless in the clutches of evil biker zombies.  Beautiful, stunning and thought-provoking...",1079913600,2,366,5.258620689655173
1687057,2,B0000633TE,Just a realy awful movie. It's not even worth describing the thing because my brain is still numb from all of the bad acting and story(I guess). The only reason I gave it a 2 is for some gore but it's hardly worth sitting through.,1047513600,3,230,4.133333333333334
1687058,1,B0000633TE,"I just finished watching this film and have to say that it is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  There were no redeeming qualities to it.  The plot was horrible, the camera work and sound were worse, and the special effects were appalling!  What kind of person makes a movie like this and thinks it's good?  Seriously, if I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to steer clear of Biker Zombies from Detroit.  You will be sorry you wasted even an hour of your life on it.",1045785600,11,500,4.166666666666667
1687059,3,B0000633TE,"just for the record.  saw some other view say the movie was an hour and a half which is dead wrong.  movie is only an hour and six minutes, very very short movie.  is a real good movie for a low budget film though.  the beginning really started off good and kept going for a while.  the bad thing is that you don't see much of the biker zombies, just a couple of scenes then it concentrates on one zombie kid.  wish the film would have been longer but otherwise not really a bad film, one that is worth checking out.  hopefully they'll make a sequel thats a little bit longer as well.",1027814400,7,584,4.115044247787611
1687060,2,B0000633TE,"After viewing this movie, I was left wondering what I had just spent an hour and a half watching.  This movie had no plot, no storyline... it was like watching people just do things that in the end had no point.  The only saving grace in this movie was the hilarious scene where they kept showing this cop taking the same bite out of a donut.  The ending was horrible (as in most zombie movies), but this one was especially bad.  And what's with the scene where they keep showing the homeless guy?  Is that supposed to be a transition between scenes or something?  I'm glad I rented this and did not buy it....",1025049600,4,610,4.307017543859649
7958367,1,B0000633TE,Almost no Zombie action in this film. I expected stupid & bad but the title is deceiving. Even the Zombies are terrible.,1390176000,,120,4.5

A teenage boy moves to Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He begins dating a teenage girl. Her biker ex-boyfriend is disenchanted by this turn of events. He and his pals try to beat up the teenage boy. But before they do, some zombies turn this teenager into another zombie -- who then stalks and begins killing the ex-boyfriend's gang. (Well, it's not really a gang -- they're kinda preppy for bikers.)

Yes, this film is sorta crappy. It's a low-budget indie effort shot in Michigan. The actors are no-name locals, without any discernible acting abilities. The dialogue is often drab, even for a zombie film. Some of the special effects (e.g., when the cops run over a woman) are inept, but in a hilariously gory, low-budget kind of way.

Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed this film. (Admittedly, you have to like home movie quality, grassroots indie horror films.) It's mostly well-paced. Only a few instances of overly long scenes of empty chit-chat. And it's mercifully short at only an hour and 7 minutes (not including end credits -- which run surprisingly long for such a low budget effort.)

The ""original score"" by Jeffrey Michael effectively enhances the film's mood. Michael also has a role as one of the bikers. (He's a better composer than actor.)

Some scenes are washed-out and flatly lit, but some scenes (the final confrontation between the cops and zombie bikers) have that certain haunting quality which occasionally pops up in low-budget indie efforts. That serendipitous moment when inept, trashy gore collides with an eerily-lit and well-composed shot.

One critic said that BIKER ZOMBIES was shot on VHS. I'm not so sure. There's a moment of ""comic relief"" in this film, set in a diner prior to a zombie attack, in which a pretentious film student lectures on the superiority of film over video. So I wonder if BIKER ZOMBIES wasn't shot on 16mm (or even super-8mm) film stock?",1363824000,,2170,5.27536231884058

7958372,1,B0000633TE,With the nice houses in this flick I cant help but think some rich kids bank rolled this with rich parents. Its a complete pile of goo. Yet its not the worst as Netflix features zombie movies so bad you wish you were a zombie so you didn't know what you were watching. This film has a slightly better grade of film stock. They could have made something with a 70's look and grit had they any idea what they were doing and what a plot and intrigue and a good horror story are.,1302912000,,475,4.0638297872340425

7958374,1,B0000633TE,"Biker Zombies from Detroit (Todd Brunswick, 2001)

The tagline for this movie was ""evil never looked so bad"". I'm relatively sure that the accuracy of that statement, as it applies to this movie, was not exactly what the filmmakers had in mind. But it definitely applies: evil has never had such a bad make-up job, been so badly acted, or sported less coherence than it does in Biker Zombies from Detroit. And to make things worse, Biker Zombies from Detroit is not even a whole bad movie; it's the first half of a bad movie. We are given these characters, we get to know them a little, we get what might have been a halfway interesting premise were it not so badly presented, and then...the movie simply ends. There is no climax, there is no resolution, plot points are neatly severed by the end of the film. I guess they were planning a sequel. It's probably for the best that it never got made.

In any case, what little plot there is centers on Ken (Tyrus Woodson), the new kid in town, and a trio of punks who get on his nerves, one of whom lives next door.  Ken starts dating one's ex-girlfriend, with the expected results. Meanwhile, there's this undead guy who recruits a trio of the most vicious hoods to be found in Detroit for his undead biker gang. These two plot lines do eventually collide, but they do so so close to the end of the movie that they might as well not.

Has everything you expect from a no-budget horror movie and less; wooden acting, bad lighting, terrible direction, mushy sound, etc. About the only recommendation I can give it is that it wasn't outright awful enough for me to turn it off before it ended. (half)",1233964800,,1645,4.45514950166113
7958375,5,B0000633TE,"I won't lie to you, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But somewhere in between the buckets of blood tossed on actors being run over by motorcycles, the boom microphones dropping into scenes, the rapidly changing lack of plot, and the wonderful way the actors read off of their prompters, this movie made a special place in my heart that will never be the same. I watched this with several friends and did not stop laughing at something in the movie the entire time. Keep your expectations as low as possible (you get what you pay for), and this movie should entertain you more than most.",1129766400,3,607,4.4774774774774775
